<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Sexual Behavior</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the mid-1930's, Americans have, at one time or another,
either acclaimed or decried marihuana as an aphrodisiac, lauded
its ability to intensify and enhance enjoyment of sexual
experiences and accused it of heightening sexual aggression and
inciting the commission of sexual offenses. Even today, there is
no consensus among Americans regarding what they consider to be
the effects of marihuana on sexual desire, arousal and
performance. Rather, what evidence exists on the subject
continues to reveal the existence of diverse and often
inconsistent beliefs and experiences. </p>

<p>Society's concern about the effects of marihuana on sexual
behavior, however, does not generally center on the drug's
inherent ability to produce or heighten sexual arousal per se but
on the relationship between sexual arousal and the likelihood of
sexual excess on the part of the user. The key question is the
extent to which and the conditions under which marihuana acts as
a catalyst to sexual aggression, profligacy, promiscuity and
other aberrant sexual behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AND PSYCHOSEXUAL STIMULATION</b> </p>

<p>The numerous medical and clinical observations, experimental
investigations and survey studies reviewed by the Commission show
that the belief regarding the stimulant effects of marihuana and
the use of hemp drugs to achieve sexual arousal, the improvement
of sexual powers and the prolongation of coition have existed for
centuries and have be-en documented (Chopra and Chopra, 1939;
Bouquet, 1950; Robinson, 1967; Grinspoon, 1971) ; The proportion
of the population actually aroused sexually by marihuana,
however, is difficult to assess. Relevant research findings are
based on widely divergent research procedures, differing criteria
of arousal, and variations in the amount of arousal experienced.
Nonetheless, it is fair to state that marihuana produces
heightened sexual interest, desire and arousal in substantial
proportions of both male and female users (Bromberg, 1934;
Allentuck, 1944; Johnson, 1968; Goode, 1969; Hochman and Brill,
1971). It is equally accurate to state, however, that marihuana
does not increase and in fact may decrease sexual desire or
stimulation in significant proportions of users (Walton, 1938;
Chopra and Chopra, 1939; Taylor, 1963; Brenner, Coles and
Meagher, 1970; Goode, in press). At best, the available evidence
is inconclusive. </p>

<p>In a study of regular marihuana users conducted by three
physicians, for example, &quot;heightened sexual feeling&quot;
and &quot;increased sexual arousal&quot; while under the
influence of the drug were reportedly experienced
&quot;usually&quot; by one-third of the subjects (34%, and 33%,
respectively) and each of these effects was experienced
&quot;occasionally&quot; by 59% of the sample (Halikas, Goodwin
and Guze, 1971). </p>

<p>In another more recent study by physicians, &quot;increased
sexual appetite&quot; was reported by 60% of the chronic users
and 43% of the occasional users of marihuana. Responses to a
similar question regarding &quot;decreased sexual appetite,&quot;
revealed that 75% of the chronic users and 70% of the occasional
users reported that this never occurred (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) likewise attempted
to assess the effects of marihuana on sexual interest and sexual
stimulation. Its clinical studies of 72 male prisoners conducted
at the Welfare Hospital in New York City revealed that
&quot;although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, . . . This sex
interest seems to have been due primarily to the fact that these
men have been imprisoned for various periods and had not had
access to women&quot; (p. 130). With respect to marihuana's
effect on sexual stimulation the Committee indicated that
although &quot;some evidence of eroticism&quot; was reported (in
about 10% of the 150 instances in which marihuana was
administered), there was no &quot;frank expression of sexual
stimulation&quot; despite the presence of female nurses,
attendants and others associated with the experiment (p. 38). </p>

<p>More recently, Professor Goode published the results of an
informal survey of about 200 marihuana users in which he inquired
about the relationship of marihuana to both sexual desire and
sexual activity. To the question, &quot;Do you think that being
high on marihuana stimulates your sex interest, or not?&quot;,
38% said that their interest in sex while high was no different
in degree from their normal interest in sex; 5% stated that being
high on marihuana had a negative effect, i.e., that &quot;it
tended to turn them off sexually&quot;; 13% replied that the
effect depended on either their mood, their partner or both; and
44% (39% of the men and 50% of the women) reported that it
&quot;definitely increases their sexual desire&quot; (1970: 162).
</p>

<p>Perhaps the most conclusive and consistent finding to emerge
from studies of the effects of marihuana on psychosexual
stimulation is that the degree of sexual interest, desire and
arousal induced by marihuana is dependent on the characteristics
of the user and the extent to which he comes to expect or
anticipate such an effect. Research shows that women are more
likely to report heightened sexual desire than are men (Goode,
1969) ; that young people more frequently report arousal than do
older persons (Bloomquist, 1968; Brenner, Coles and Meagher,
1970) ; 2 that frequent users are more likely to report increased
sex interest than infrequent users (Goode, 1970) ; that persons
who are more sexually experienced are more likely to be sexually
aroused by marihuana than are those less sexually experienced
(Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill, 1971; Goode
in press) and that those who expect to be sexually aroused by the
drug are more likely to be so aroused than those who do not
(Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970; Grinspoon, 1971). </p>

<p>There is nothing inherent in the drug itself which produces
heightened sexual interest, desire or arousal, nor is there any
physiological evidence to show that marihuana directly or
specifically acts on either the, sexual centers of the brain or
the sexual organs. As one observer has noted, marihuana &quot;is
not a sexual stimulant; that is, in the, sense that it will not
excite mindless, laboratory-located animal tissue&quot; (Goode,
1969: 20). In short, marihuana is not an aphrodisiac. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>HOW MARIHUANA INFLUENCES SEXUAL RESPONSE</b> </p>

<p>It has already been stated that marihuana is not, in itself,
an aphrodisiac although a substantial number of persons report
increased sexual interest, desire and arousal following use of
the drug. To what, then, are these effects attributable? Research
hearing on this question suggests that to the extent that
marihuana influences these respouses, it does so indirectly by
acting on the higher centers of the brain to relax inhibitions
and reduce, the usual restraints on behavior. By so doing, the
user is placed in the position of being freer to respond to his
sexual needs and desires (Walton, 1938; Allentuck and Bowman,
1942; Ausubel, 1958; Brown, 1961; McGothlin, 1966; Rosevear,
1967; Bloomquist, 1968; Oursler, 1968; Goode, 1969; Fort, 1970).
The extent to which these responses occur, however, are dependent
upon individual expectation and knowledge (Fort, 1970) and the
social situation (set and setting) in which the marihuana use
takes place (Goode, 1969). As Professor Goode has stated, Man's
somatic responses are often influenced more by what he thinks
than by biological and chemical imperatives; in fact, it can
happen that what he thinks actually becomes his biological and
chemical imperative (1969, p. 20). </p>

<p>In addition to its effects on sexual inhibition and restraints
(the extent and consequences of which will be examined later),
marihuana is also reported to intensity aesthetic experiences and
to enhance sensual activity. As one observer has noted, it is
perhaps the principal effect of marihuana to take one more
intensely into whatever experience - .&quot; (Trocchi, 1967:
108). </p>

<p>One observer points out, however, that most of the users of
marihuana in this country are youths between the ages of 14 and
25 and that &quot;this age span needs no aphrodisiac to stimulate
either interest or capacity to perform&quot; (Bloomquist, 1968:
183). </p>

<p>It is this fact (which probably explains why substantial
proportions of marihuana users characterize their sexual
experiences under the influence of the drug as particularly
intense, prolonged, sensuous and pleasurable (Johnson, 1968;
Goode, 1969; Brenner, Coles and Meagher, 1970; Hochman and Brill,
1971; Tart, 1971; Abelson, et al., 1972). </p>

<p>In one study of marihuana users conducted by a psychologist,
65% reported a heightened sense of touch, 55% stated that
&quot;touch takes on new qualities,&quot; and 56% replied that
&quot;sexual orgasm was very often or usually more exciting than
when &quot;straight&quot;' (Tart, 1971). Of the approximately 500
marihuana users surveyed by Goode, 68% (74% of the men and 62% of
the women) reported that marihuana &quot;Generally acted as a
pleasure enhancer (and) usually increased their sexual
enjoyment&quot; (Goode, in press, pp. 8-9). </p>

<p>In still another study of marihuana users, both occasional and
chronic, &quot;increased sexual pleasure&quot; was the second
most common response, by the chronic users and the eighth most
commonly reported effect by the occasional users; 83% of the
former and 50% of the latter reported that increased sexual
pleasure was often or always experienced after smoking
marihuana.' Interesting too, was the finding that 85% of the
chronic users and 78% of the occasional users reported never
experiencing &quot;decreased sexual pleasure&quot; following use
of the drug (Hochman and Brill, 1971:7). </p>

<p>In the Commission's National Survey, respondents were asked to
indicate whether or not they believed that marihuana increases
sexual pleasure. Of those adults admitting they had tried
marihuana at least once (15%), 52% thought that the drug does
increase sexual pleasure. Both adults and youth in general,
however, seem to be less certain of this effect. Only about
one-fourth of all respondents (24% of adults and 26% of youth)
indicated agreement with the statement while slightly tinder
one-half of those surveyed (48% of the adults and 49% of the
youth) expressed uncertainty about marihuana's ability to
increase sexual pleasure (Ableson, et al., 1972: 25-33). </p>

<p>3 The students were also asked to assess the degree of
importance attached to a number of possible motivations for using
marihuana. As might be expected from the findings regarding
marihuana and sexual enjoyment, significantly more of the users
than the nonusers attached at least some degree of importance to
marihuana's perceived ability to enhance sexual experiences. To
the item: &quot;for better sexual experiences,&quot; 12% of the
non-users, 40% of the occasional users and 70% of the chronic
users felt that it was of some importance or &quot;very&quot;
important in motivating use of the drug (Hochman and Brill,
1971). </p>

<p>The research bearing on the effects of marihuana on sexual
pleasure suggests that marihuana is not usually perceived by the
general public to increase sexual enjoyment, that users are
significantly more likely to believe that marihuana has this
effect than are non-users, that those who expect to receive
increased sexual pleasure are more likely to experience it than
those who do not, and that frequent or regular users are
significantly more likely to have actually experienced this
effect than are those who use the drug less frequently. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE EFFECTS OF MARIHUANA ON OVERT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR<br>
</b></p>

<p>As noted at the beginning of this discussion, society in
general and policy makers in particular are primarily concerned
about the extent to which and the conditions tinder which
marihuana is likely to generate or increase, the likelihood of
sexually aberrant or aggressive behavior. Marihuana has already
been shown to increase psychosexual stimulation in substantial
proportions of users and to serve as a relaxer of inhibitions and
restraints. The questions as yet unresolved, however, relate to
(a) the importance of sexual arousal in generating sexual
activity-particularly deviant sexual acts, and (b) the extent to
which inhibitions and restraints, which normally serve to protect
the individual and society from sexual excess and abuse, are
lowered by marihuana to the point of being inoperative. </p>

<p>The available evidence suggests that (a) although marihuana
users are more sexually active and sexually permissive than are
nonusers, marihuana does not generally stimulate sexual activity,
appreciably alter established patterns of sexual behavior or
serve as a catalyst to sexual promiscuity; (b) the marihuana user
is rarely sexually aggressive; and (c) persons arrested for
marihuana law violations generally do not have previous or
subsequent criminal records for the commission of sexual offenses
(Walton, 1938; Brown, 1961; White House Conference on Narcotic
Drug Abuse, 1962; Blunt et al., 1969; Bremner, Coles and Meagher,
1970; Goode, 1972; Goode, in press). </p>

<p>Before summarizing the research forming, the basis of these
assertions, however, it should be noted that there, are several
contradictory research findings with respect to (a) above. In one
recent study, for example, two Philadelphia physicians
investigating the effects of marihuana on adolescents and young
adults reported that the drug was directly responsible for sexual
promiscuity in 13 of their female patients. In the words of these
clinicians: </p>

<p><i>This group is singled out because of the unusual degree of
sexual promiscuity, which ranged from sexual relations with
several individuals of both sexes, and, sometimes, individuals of
both sexes on the same evening. In histories of all of these
individuals, we were struck by the loss of sexual inhibitions
after short periods of marihuana smoking. Seven patients of this
group became pregnant (one on several occasions), and four
developed venereal diseases. . . . In no instance was there
sexual promiscuity prior to the beginning of marihuana smoking. .
. . We take these results to indicate marihuana's effects on
loosening the superego controls and altering superego ideals</i>
(Kolansky and Moore, 1971: 491). <br>
</p>

<p>During 1970, another researcher (Goode, in press) distributed
questionnaires on drug use to between 500 and 600 undergraduates
in a large lecture course at a State University. Four measures of
sexual activity were employed: (1) engagement in premarital
intercourse, (2) the respondent's total number of different
sexual partners, (3) the age of first intercourse and (4) the
average frequency of intercourse during the six months prior to
the study. The three indices of drug use employed were whether or
not the respondent had ever smoked marihuana, the frequency of
marihuana use during the six months prior to the survey, and the
total number of drugs or drug types ever used by the respondent.
The researcher found that &quot;all measures of sexual activity
correlated significantly -and powerfully with all measures of
drug use&quot; (p. 12). More specifically, marihuana users were
far more likely to have engaged in premarital intercourse (72%)
than were non-users (34%) ; the greater the frequency of
marihuana use and the greater the number of drugs ever tried, the
earlier was the first intercourse, the greater was the frequency
of intercourse and the greater was the number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>As the researcher suggests, one might be tempted to conclude
from these findings that marihuana, as well as other drugs,
causes early sex, frequent sex and sex with a number of different
partners were it not for the fact that similar findings point to
a relationship in the opposite direction. That is, not only were
marihuana users and drug experimenters more likely to experience
sex early in their lives, but &quot;it is also the sexually
precocious who are more likely to use drugs, including
marihuana&quot; (p. 14). Of all respondents reporting intercourse
by age 16, for example, 7% stated that they had never tried any
illegal drug, but total absence of illicit drug use was found in
47% of the virgins (p. 14). </p>

<p>Professor Goode concludes that &quot;using marihuana or other
illegal drugs no more 'causes' sexual behavior than sexual
behavior 'causes' drug use&quot; (p. 14). Rather, he suggests, </p>

<p><i>Both sexual permissiveness and marihuana use as well as, to
some extent, experimentation with certain other illegal drugs-are
indicators of the young person's involvement in and with a
subculture which is tolerant toward a wide range of
nontraditional values and activities . . . Quite clearly,
marihuana use grows out of a specific life style, which is, in
turn, partly dependent on specific sociocultural background
factors and permissive sexual behavior (branded as
&quot;promiscuous&quot; by those who disapprove of it) is a part
of this life style</i> (pp. 14, 16). </p>

<p>Similar to Goode's findings are those obtained from a mail
survey of 1400 undergraduate students at UCLA (Hochman and Brill,
1971). The data show that marihuana users have their first sexual
experience earlier than do non-users (50% of the users and 30% of
the non-users had their first experience before age 18) ; have
more sexual experience than non-users; have a greater number of
sexual partners than do nonusers (twice as many users as
non-users had five or more sexual partners) ; and have more
liberal attitudes toward sex than do non-users. </p>

<p>One of the questions asked of the students was: &quot;In your
experience or opinion, do you think that marihuana usage over a
long period results in sexual promiscuity?&quot; Over half of the
non-users (54%) and almost three-fourths (73%) of the users
believed this happened rarely or not at all while 12% of the
nonusers, 3% of the occasional users and 2% of the chronic users
believed that extended use of marihuana frequently leads to
sexual promiscuity. </p>

<p>Although the users more often suffered from venereal disease
than did the nonusers (7% vs. 2%), there were no differences
between the groups in the average frequency of sexual
intercourse, the number of concurrent sexual partners, the number
of pregnancies, miscarriages and illegitimacies, or the incidence
of homosexuality. </p>

<p>A more middle-of-the-road position regarding the association
between use of marihuana and sexual promiscuity was revealed in a
Commission sponsored mail survey of 781 judges, probation
officers and court clinicians (InTech, 1971). In an effort to
develop a profile of the regular marihuana. user, respondents
were asked: &quot;In light of your professional experience, do
you, think all, most, some or just a, few of the people who
regularly use marihuana are sexually promiscuous?&quot; </p>

<p>Tabulation of the responses revealed, among all three groups,
considerable uncertainty and ambivalence as manifested in the
findings that 23% of the total sample either did not answer the
question or stated that they did not know, and that three-fifths
of those who responded (70%) would answer no more categorically
than to say that only some&quot; could be characterized in this
manner. The percentages of each of the three groups of
respondents stating that all or most, some and few or none of the
regular marihuana users are sexually promiscuous are shown in
Table 4. </p>

<p>The Commission has found several studies dating from 1939
which support the assertions that the marihuana user is rarely
sexually aggressive and that he rarely has a criminal record for
the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>A survey of the criminal records of 379 Greek offenders either
sentenced or arrested for the public use of hashish between 1919
and 1950 (Gardikas, 1950) revealed no link between the use of
hashish and the commission of sexual offenses. </p>

<p>Lambo (1965) compiled a list of crimes which occurred during a
recent two-year period in three West African countries. Of the
472 &quot;offences against women&quot; committed during the
period of study, 26% were claimed to have been committed by users
of cannabis. </p>

<p>In a, study conducted by the Kinsey Institute for Sex
Research, 1500 incarcerated sex offenders were interviewed about
their sexual offenses. The researchers found that in marked
contrast to the role of alcohol in the commission of their
offenses, particularly aggressive sex crimes, marihuana was a
very insignificant factor. While the presence of alcohol was
reported in relation to 67% of all sexually aggressive acts
against children and 39% of such aggressive acts against adult
women, marihuana was mentioned in only eight sexual offenses out
of a total of 2,022 such offenses committed by the respondents
(Gebbard, Gagnon, Pomeroy and Christenson, 1967: 761-819). </p>

<p>Two recent systematic studies of rape cases recorded by the
police in Philadelphia (Amir, 1971) and Denver (MacDonald, 1971)
gave no indication that marihuana was specifically linked to
these offenses. It should be noted, however, that the involvement
of marihuana in these cases, unlike the involvement of alcohol,
was not specifically explored.<br>
</p>

<p>Total (N=701) 21.3 59.6 19.1<br>
</p>

<p>In two Commission-sponsored studies of the relationship
between marihuana and crime, no evidence was found to suggest
that marihuana is a significant factor in or contributor to the
commission of sexual offenses. A study of 1,776 youthful
offenders (16 to 21 years of age) arrested for marihuana law
violations in five New York counties between 1965 and 1969
revealed that none of the offenders had either a previous or
subsequent criminal record for the commission of sexual offenses
(Weitzner, et. al., 1971). </p>

<p>In another study sponsored by the Commission, interviews with
559 male residents (16 to 34 years of age) of West Philadelphia,
revealed that six respondents, or about one in 100, admitted to
having committed the offense of &quot;forcing sexual
intercourse,&quot; three having reportedly committed it more than
once but none having been apprehended for these offenses (Goode,
1972; 29a). </p>

<p>In an effort to assess the role of marihuana in these
offenses, respondents were asked whether or not they had used the
drug within the 24 hours preceding the commission of both their
first and most recent offenses. In contrast to alcohol, which was
reported to have been consumed within 24 hours prior to one-third
of the first and most recent offenses of forcing sexual
intercourse (two out of six and one out of three, respectively),
none of the offenders reported smoking marihuana within 24 hours
of either the first or most recent time they committed this
offense (Goode, 1972: 29a). </p>

<p>Research findings which are available lend little support to
the thesis that marihuana either causes or is a significant
factor in the heightening of sexual aggression or the commission
of sexual offenses.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and (Non-Violent) Crime</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much that has been said with respect to aggressive behavior
and violent crime also applies to the more general proposition
that marihuana causes or leads to (non-violent) crime and
delinquency. The popular and professional literature abounds with
claims and counter-claims. Public and professional opinion
surveys demonstrate a widespread belief in the existence of a
marihuana-crime relationship but also reveal considerable
uncertainty about the existence of such a relationship. </p>

<p>The empirical evidence is somewhat more consistent. Laboratory
studies provide no evidence that marihuana produces effects which
can be interpreted as criminogenic. Although some studies of
offender populations purport to demonstrate a causal relationship
between marihuana and crime, they reveal, at the most, a
significant statistical association. Closer examination of these
data or more sophisticated analysis, however, generally shows the
purported relationship to be spurious. The original relationship
is usually found to derive not from the chemical effects of the
drug but from the operation of social and cultural variables
unrelated to either the drug or its use. </p>

<p>In the following pages the available evidence bearing on the
relationship between marihuana. and crime will be reviewed in an
effort to determine whether marihuana itself or the use of the
drug plays a significant precipitating or contributory role in
the commission of criminal or delinquent acts. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PUBLIC AND PROFESSIONAL OPINION</b> </p>

<p>The formulation and expression of strong opinions about the
relationship of marihuana to criminal and delinquent behavior
have persisted despite the inherent complexities of the issue,
the relative absence of conclusive empirical evidence and the
general lack of knowledge and understanding about the effects of
the drug. For the most part, however, neither public nor
professional opinion about marihuana and its impact on public
safety has been explored in any systematic fashion. As a
consequence, public policy with respect to the drug has been
shaped by the most vociferous advocates of one position or
another at any given time. </p>

<p>Probably the first official body to explore prevailing opinion
about the relationship between marihuana use and crime was the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission of 1893-1894. The Commission spent
over a year in making field trips to 30 cities, in receiving
evidence from almost 1,200 expert witnesses (335 of whom were
medical practitioners) and in reviewing judicial proceedings and
the case files from India's mental hospitals. The Commission's
Report, reprinted in 1969, contains the following information
gathered with respect to the relationship of marihuana use to
crime. </p>

<p>First, the Commission found that the majority of hemp drug
consumers were moderate rather than excessive users, and that the
drug users were rarely regarded as offensive or potentially
dangerous by their neighbors (a few objected to the smell of the
smoke or the example set by the users for the neighborhood
children). </p>

<p>With respect to the drug's possible long-term or chronic
criminogenic effects (producing &quot;bad characters&quot;), the
Commission reported that two thirds of the witnesses did not
believe that marihuana would produce, over time, a large
proportion of &quot;bad characters&quot; among the moderate
users. A majority felt that even excessive use was unrelated to
the production of &quot;bad characters.&quot; When the possible
relationship was framed more precisely in terms of cause-effect
rather than statistical association, a ratio of 8 to 1 of the
witnesses held that moderate consumption of these drugs had no
connection with crime and a ratio of 4 to 1 denied a causal
connection between excessive consumption and being a &quot;bad
character.&quot; </p>

<p>With respect to the more acute effects of hemp drugs, the
Commission set out to determine whether criminals use the drug to
fortify their courage prior to the commission of their crimes,
whether the drugs were used by criminals &quot;to stupefy their
victims,&quot; and whether the drugs incited the user to commit
unpremeditated crimes. The Commission's conclusion regarding the
first question was that &quot;criminals like any other consumers
of these drugs go to them for that assistance when they feel they
require it&quot; (p. 256). </p>

<p>To the second question, the Commission responded that although
some persons had alleged the commission of &quot;thefts of
ornaments from children stupefied by sweet meats&quot; containing
marihuana, the fact of other readily available, more effective
and more disabling drugs, considerably more conducive to
surreptitious administration, cast doubt on the use of hemp drugs
by criminals for this purpose. </p>

<p>To the third question, the Commission said that the majority
of witnesses saw no connection between either the moderate or
excessive use of hemp drugs and the commission of unpremeditated
crimes, including crimes of violence. The Commission therefore
concluded that &quot;for all practical purposes it may be laid
down that there is little or no connection between the use of
hemp drugs and crime,&quot; (p. 264). </p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944) also interviewed law
enforcement officers (federal, state and local police) about the
purported link between marihuana and crime. The Committee
reported that: </p>

<p><i>In most instances [the police officers] unhesitatingly
stated that there is no proof that major crimes are associated
with the practice of smoking marihuana. They did state that many
marihuana smokers are guilty of petty crimes, but that the
criminal career usually existed prior to the time the individual
smoked his first marihuana cigarette</i> (Schoenfeld, 1944:
14-15). </p>

<p>Reference has already been made to the results of a small,
unpublished survey of the opinions of police officers about the
relationship of marihuana to aggression (Schofield, 1968), All of
the respondents reported observing a variety of conduct exhibited
by users under the influence of marihuana and emphasized that an
individual's reaction to the drug depends on his particular
personality and, in some instances, the strength of the dose.
Some, respondents observed a recent shift in the type of
individual or personality prone to using marihuana. </p>

<p>In response to a question regarding the use of marihuana prior
to engaging in property crimes, 10 out of the 16 officers
interviewed believed that this often occurred. Seven cited
specific examples of offenders who reported using marihuana
before committing their offenses to bolster their courage and
sharpen their senses; the views of three rested on hearsay
evidence; and the remaining six officers responded that they did
not believe this was a common practice and that they had never
personally observed such examples. </p>

<p>In the Commission-sponsored National Survey of a
representative sample of more than 3,000 American youth and
adults (Abelson, et al., 1972), respondents were asked to
indicate their agreement or disagreement with the statement that
&quot;many crimes are committed by persons who show that 56% of
the adults and 41% of the youth agree with the statement. The
extent of agreement, however, varies significantly according to
age, education, geographic location and the marihuana-using
experience of the respondent. Those who are early adolescents
(12-13 years), over 25 years of age, have not completed high
school, live in the South or North Central regions of the country
and have no experience with marihuana are, significantly more
likely to agree with the statement than are those who are between
14 and 25 years of age, are at least high school graduates, live
in the Northeast or West and have had experience with marihuana.
Table 5 below, shows the percentage of respondents agreeing to
the statement according to age, education, geographic location
and experience with marihuana. </p>

<p>The survey also showed the existence of considerable
uncertainty with respect to the proposition that many crimes are
committed by persons under the influence of marihuana; 25%, of
the youth and 17% of the adults were either unsure of its
relative truth or failed to respond to the question (p. 69).
Adults were considerably more certain, however, about the
relationship between alcohol and crime (youth were not asked the
question) ; 7% were either unsure or did not respond and 69%
agreed with the statement that many crimes are committed by
persons who were under the influence of liquor (pp. 28, 31). </p>

<p>The surveys of prosecuting attorneys, judges, probation
officers and court clinicians also revealed considerable doubt
about the existence of a causal connection between marihuana and
crime. Although the survey of prosecuting attorneys conducted by
the Commission staff asked only about aggressive behavior and
violent crime, the data showed that 52% of the respondents either
denied or were uncertain that marihuana causes such behavior. </p>

<p>The Commission-sponsored survey of nationally representative
samples of judges, probation officers and court clinicians,
however, posed several questions bearing on the more general
proposition that marihuana is related to crime and delinquency
(InTech, 1971). Respondents were first asked whether or not they
had witnessed an increase in the incidence of drug or
drug-related offenses in their caseloads during the past five
years. The large majority of all three groups (86%) responded
affirmatively and reported that marihuana was the type of drug
most often seen in this connection (83%). However, about two
thirds of the respondents reported that marihuana offenders
(those arrested for using or selling marihuana) constituted less
than 20% of their caseloads; 56% of the respondents reported that
those arrested for non-drug offenses but incidentally found to
possess marihuana comprised less than 10% of their caseloads; and
73% of the respondents reported that less than 10% of their
caseloads attributed their offenses to marihuana (pp. 31, 34). </p>

<p>To determine better the nature and direction of a possible
relationship between marihuana use and crime, respondents were
asked to indicate which -of four statements most reflected their
own professional experience. On the whole, the respondents were
more likely to postulate a statistical association (36.6%) rather
than a direct cause-effect relationship (26.9%) ; 18% of the
respondents thought that involvement in a criminal or delinquent
subculture caused or led to the use of marihuana (in contrast to
the. more prevalent belief that marihuana use, leads to crime)
and 9.1% believed there was absolutely no relationship between
marihuana use and other criminal or delinquent behavior. The
extent to which uncertainty prevails even among these practicing
professionals is reflected in the 9.3% no response category (p.
39). </p>

<p>Table 6 shows the responses of the judges, probation officers
and clinicians to each of the four propositions (InTech, 1971:
Appendix 1, Section II, Question 3). The data show that judges
are significantly more, likely to believe that marihuana causes
or leads to criminal and delinquent behavior and significantly
less likely to believe in either a statistical relationship or in
no relationship whatsoever than either the probation officers or
the clinicians. </p>

<p>The researchers also attempted to determine these,
professionals' opinions about crimes actually committed by
marihuana users. More specifically, did the respondents think
that most non-drug crimes committed by persons who were known
users of marihuana occurred when the individuals were, actually
under the influence of the drug or when they attempted to obtain
it? Again, the responses indicated considerable uncertainty in
all three, groups. One-third of the, respondents were either
unsure or did not respond to either proposition. About twice the
number of respondents thought that the crimes occurred while in
the attempt to obtain marihuana (31.0%) rather than while tinder
the influence of marihuana (16.8%). </p>

<p>Table 7 shows the percentage of respondents indicating the
probable truth and probable nontruth of the two propositions
(Appendix 1, Section 11, Questions 2a, 2b). </p>

<p>The data show that half of the respondents denied the
commission of non-drug crimes while under the influence of the
drug, suggesting that marihuana itself does not have the capacity
to produce criminogenic effects. About one-third of the
respondents, however, believed that these crimes occur when the
user is attempting to obtain the drug, suggesting an addiction
model; that is, that users commit crimes to support a
&quot;habit.&quot;` </p>

<p>This interpretation is corroborated by the significant
findings that 65% of the respondents either did not know (23%) or
thought that a few (21%), some (17%) or most (4.4%) of the
regular users were physically addicted to marihuana<br>
</p>

</p>

<p>The National Survey of the general public (Abelson, et al.,
1972) likewise showed that large segments of the population (65%
of all adults and 48% of all youth) regard marihuana as
addictive. Even among the users, 40% of adults and 21% of the
youth believed marihuana to be addicting (p. 22) </p>

<p>These findings, taken together, suggest that much of the
confusion regarding the relationship between marihuana and crime
may be predicated on public and professional misconceptions about
the drug's addiction potential. The Commission's National Survey
showed that, among those persons who believed marihuana to be
addicting, 67.5% of the adults and 52.3% of the youth believed
that many crimes are committed by persons under the influence of
marihuana. Among those who said that marihuana was not addicting,
34.6% of the adults and 30.2% of the youth agreed that many
crimes are committed by marihuana users. Table 8 below shows this
relationship (unpublished data, Abelson, et al., 1972). </p>

</p>

<p>To summarize, these opinion surveys demonstrate that there is
considerable uncertainty about the existence and the nature of a
relationship between marihuana use and crime and that this
uncertainty exists among youth and adults, practicing
professionals in the criminal justice community and the lay
public, marihuana users and non-users alike. The data suggest,
however, that the persistent and fairly widespread belief in a
cause-effect relationship between marihuana and crime may, at
least in part, be predicated on the erroneous but equally
prevalent belief that marihuana is physically addicting. To the
extent that the general public operates under this misconception,
they may be more likely to believe that, like the heroin user,
the marihuana &quot;addict&quot; commits crime in order to
support his &quot;habit&quot; and obtain the drug. </p>

<p>The logical extension of this belief is that marihuana users,
like heroin user-,, will be considered more likely to commit
their crimes in the attempt to obtain the drug than while under
the influence of the drug. Stated another way, persons who
believe that marihuana is physically addicting would be more
likely to base the purported causal relationship between
marihuana and crime not on the chemical effects of the drug per
se but on the user's physical need for the drug. As such, they
would be more likely to postulate that most crimes committed by
users occur not when the offender is under the influence of the
drug (which, like heroin, makes one passive, lethargic and
stuporous) but when the, &quot;addict&quot; needs a
&quot;fix&quot; and is desperately trying to obtain the drug or
the money to buy it. This interpretation is, indeed, supported by
the findings of the Commission-sponsored survey of judges,
probation officers and court clinicians and is suggested from the
findings of the National Survey. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>STUDIES OF OFFENDER POPULATIONS</b> </p>

<p>Over the years, numerous studies have relied on offender
populations and zero-order statistical correlations to
&quot;demonstrate&quot; a cause-effect relationship between
marihuana and crime. This method of &quot; proof by
enumeration&quot; has become probably the most common approach to
&quot;demonstrating&quot; the purported causal relationship. </p>

<p>As Goode (1970) has noted, however: </p>

<p><i>Not even marihuana's staunchest supporter would argue that
a crime has never been committed by a user while high. Yet,
incredible as it seems, the burden of many proofs of marihuana's
criminal effects has been precisely the simple fact that it is
possible to locate crimes committed in conjunction with smoking
marihuana. &quot;Proof&quot; by enumeration is no proof at all.
By examining an enumeration of crimes which were committed under
the influence of marihuana (even were this definitely known), it
is impossible to determine the &quot; cause&quot; of the event
taking place, in this ease the crime-or, indeed, that marihuana
has anything whatsoever to do with its commission</i> (pp.
215-216). </p>

<p>Even if these studies are taken at face value, their findings
do not generally support the thesis of a positive and significant
statistical association. In most instances, marihuana has not
been found to predispose one to commit crime or to serve as an
initiator of criminal careers; nor does the use of the drug
appear to alter the progression to other non-drug offenses among
those without prior criminal records or histories of
psychological maladjustment. Predictably, however </p>

<p>the data do indicate a greater rate, of progression among
marihuana-using offenders (both those arrested specifically for
their marihuana offenses and those charged with non-drug crimes)
than that which might be expected from similar, non-using
offenders or from the general population. </p>

<p>Because these studies do provide at least interesting insights
into the possible nature and direction of a relationship between
marihuana and crime or, conversely, a non-existent relationship,
several of these studies are summarized below. </p>

<p>Bromberg, 1939. Between 1932 and 1937, Bromberg and his team
of researchers reviewed all cases eventuating in conviction by
New York's Courts of General and Special Sessions; conducted
interviews with about 17,000 drug and non-drug-using offenders;
and analyzed the statistics from both courts. The report of this
work, published in 1939, yielded the following information. </p>

<p>Among the 16,854 offenders convicted of felonies in the court
of General Sessions, 67 (.005%) were identified as marihuana
users. Of these 67, 46 (697c) had been convicted on charges of
possession with intent to sell; 16 (24%) were charged with
burglary, robbery and grand larceny; two persons were charged
with assault and one each was charged with petty larceny, forgery
and murder. </p>

<p>The researcher points out that in only nine cases did the,
offenders' criminal records commence with a drug charge,
&quot;indicating that there was not in those cases a close
relationship between drugs and the beginning of a career in
crime&quot; (p. 10). </p>

<p>In a 25% random sample of offenders convicted in the Court of
Special Sessions (misdemeanors), 135 or 9% were charged with
possession of marihuana. Of these 135, 93 or 69% had no previous
record, 8 had been charged previously with drug violations only,
5 had mixed drug and non-drug charges and 29 (21%) had only
non-drug arrests. In summary, the researcher stated that: </p>

<p>As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in
the Court of General Sessions (felonies) . . . , </p>

<p><i>it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate
criminal careers. Similarly, in the Court of Special Sessions
(misdemeanors), only 8% of the offenders had previous charges of
using drugs and 3.7% had previous charges of drugs and other
petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases . . . then, the
earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime,
even that of using other drugs. . . . The expectancy of major
crimes following the use of cannabis in New York County is small,
according to these experiences </i>(p. 10). </p>

<p>Bromberg and Rodgers, 1946. A study of 8,280 naval and marine
prisoners at the U.S. Naval Prison in Portsmouth, New Hampshire
(1946) revealed that 40 or .0048% of the offenders were marihuana
users. The offenses they committed while in the service were:
AWOL or AOL (32, or 80%), assault or striking an officer (3),
theft (3), and narcotics violations (2). Their previous civilian
offenses included three each of assault, theft and traffic
violations and one each of gambling and narcotics violations,
drunkenness, draft dodging, and violation of the Mann Act.
Twenty-eight or 70% of the marihuana users had no previous
civilian criminal records (p. 825). </p>

<p>The preponderance of psychiatric disorders in the user group
over the non-users (40 randomly selected non-using naval
prisoners) led the researchers to conclude that &quot;marihuana
usage is but an aspect of some type of mental disorder or
personality abnormality&quot; (p. 826), a conclusion also reached
by Charen. and Perchan 1946), Ausubel (1958), Andrade (1964),
Lambo (1965), Bloomquist (1968), Simmons (1969) and Grinspoon
(1971). </p>

<p>Gardikas, 1950. The researcher reviewed the criminal records
of &quot;379 individuals either sentenced or arrested flagrante
delicto for using hashish publically&quot; between 1919 and 1950.
More than half (55%) of these individuals were already known to
law enforcement authorities prior to their use of hashish and an
additional 14% had no subsequent difficulties with the law except
for hashish and vagrancy offenses. The researcher notes, however,
that the remaining 117 offenders (31% of the original sample)
went on to become &quot; confirmed criminals after their first
hashish arrest.&quot; </p>

<p>Dividing this last subgroup of 117 into three approximately
equal parts, Gardikas. then described the subsequent criminality
of each group. The first group was given 332 more sentences
following their first sentence for using hashish; 142 (43%) were
additional hashish offenses, a similar number were for violent
crimes or crimes involving weapons, 18 were for
&quot;insults&quot; and two were for &quot;high treason.&quot; </p>

<p>In a critique of the Gardikas study, Kaplan were accumulated;
mostly for hashish offenses (42%) and thefts (20%). Although
there were a small number of violent crimes subsequently
committed by this group of offenders, most sentences subsequent
to their initial hashish sentence were for such relatively minor
offenses as illegal gambling, living on immoral earnings,
&quot;false statements of identity,&quot; and &quot;fishing with
dynamite,.&quot; </p>

<p>The, third group discussed by Gardikas, comprised of those
&quot;who after having, made use of hashish became
criminals,&quot; accumulated 332 additional sentences. Hashish
offenses were again responsible for 30% of these offenses and
most of the rest were for theft. Gardikas notes with respect to
this group that although not all of these individuals were
criminal before they used hashish, their use of hashish
&quot;turned [them] into habitual hashish smokers and habitual
criminals with a, strong propensity leading toward crime of
dishonesty and particularly theft and f rand. At least one-half
of them surely and undoubtedly are even to be characterized as
dangerous idle, vagrants&quot; (p. 203). </p>

<p>In a critique of the Gardikas study, Kaplan (1971) has stated
that: </p>

<p><i>The basic problem underlying Gardikas' paper is his
conclusion that hashish use caused his subsample of 117 arrests
to become criminals. This assumes, first. that they had not
engaged in crime before beginning to use hashish and, second,
that it was the hashish use and not something else that turned
-them toward crime. Neither of these assumptions is justified by
the data. . . . As for the first assumption . . . all we know is
that they had not been arrested or convicted for other crimes
first. . . . The second assumption . . . is also impossible to
justify. Even if the members of the subsample had not previously
been criminals, it may very well be difficult to distinguish the
criminogenic effects of hashish from those of conviction and
sentence to Greek jails.</i> </p>

<p><i>Even aside from any criminogenic effect of the Greek penal
system, the figures may indicate only that once somebody has been
arrested for hashish-and probably served a term in jail as
well-lie is more likely to be picked up by the police when
further crimes are committed. Finally, the years from 1919
through 1950 . . . were a period of enormous social dislocation
[in Greece] . . . . It is obviously an almost impossible task to
sort out how much of the subsequent criminality in the subsample
was due to hashish use and how much to the social chaos that
prevailed in Greece </i>(pp. 103-104).<br>
</p>

<p>Andrade, 1964. The researcher retrospectively reviewed the
examinations of 120 patients sentenced between 1951 and 1960 by a
Brazilian Court to Heitor Carrilho insane asylum. Sentencing in
all cases was based on the allegation that cannabis was directly
responsible for their crimes. The researcher concluded that: </p>

<p><i>In the 120 patients examined, we did; not find any
criminogenic action that could be attributed to cannabis; ... In
the majority of cases examined (83), we found patients with
psychotic disturbances. . . . In the cases in which we did not
find mental disturbances, a total of 37, the crime attributed to
them was that of carrying or selling marihuana.... In the study
of the dynamics of the crimes of all the others, we saw that
there was a link between the crime and the illness, independent
of the use of cannabis</i> (Tinklenberg, 1971: 12). </p>

<p>Lambo, 1965. The researcher compiled lists of crimes occurring
over a, two year period in three West African nations and
recorded the number of offenders perpetrating these crimes. He
found that approximately one-fourth of the offenders had previous
convictions. Forty-seven percent of the 863 offenders convicted
for false pretenses, 61% of the 2,880 convicted burglars and 54%
of those convicted on charges of &quot;culpable driving&quot;
were said to have histories of cannabis use. Many of these users,
however, were also shown to have long histories of psychological
maladjustment (p. 10). The researcher suggests that &quot;the use
of cannabis enhances suggestibility in certain individuals, and
this may be a factor in the commission of crime, by these chronic
abusers&quot; (p. 11). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARIHUANA AND CRIME:</b> </p>

<p><b>AN EXPLANATION</b> </p>

<p>As indicated at the outset, enumerative studies of the crimes
committed by apprehended marihuana, law violators and non-drug
offenders identified as marihuana users cannot, by their very
nature, either prove or disprove a causal connection between the
use of cannabis and the commission of crimes; nor can their rates
of crime be projected onto the larger universe of marihuana
users. </p>

<p>As several researchers have pointed out, those individuals
apprehended for marihuana offenses represent only a. tiny
fraction of all marihuana users (Kaplan, 1971; Weitzner, et al.,
1971) ; likewise, those in other offender samples who are
identified as marihuana users represent only a small proportion
of the offender populations of which they are a part (Bromberg,
1939; Bromberg and Rodgers, 1946; Kaplan, 1971). </p>

<p>Although the data do indicate that some individuals identified
as marihuana users are subsequently involved in crime, both
drug-specific and non-drug offenses, they do not provide support
for the thesis that cannabis was the determining factor in their
criminal careers. Likewise, they fail to indicate that the rate
of progression to other crimes manifested by these offenders was
significantly greater than that which might be expected in either
a non-using criminal subgroup or the general population. </p>

<p>As Tinklenberg (1971) has stated: </p>

<p><i>The important issue is that unless one has systematic data
on the proclivities toward crime of the various subgroups of
marihuana users, one cannot answer the crucial question of
whether the use of marihuana alters the actual rate of crime
among these various subgroups over the criminality which would be
expected. At this time, it is unknown whether individuals with
these characteristics seek the use of marihuana or whether the
use of marihuana in any way contributes to the development of
these traits</i> (P. 24). </p>

<p>By reading between the lines of these enumerative studies,
however, one would be tempted to postulate that individuals with
certain psychological, social and cultural characteristics are
more likely to seek the use of marihuana, than is marihuana
likely to contribute to the development of delinquent or criminal
behavior patterns. </p>

<p>The number of researchers pointing to individuals with long
histories of psychological maladjustment or disturbances has
already been noted. Others have alluded to persons involved,
prior to cannabis use, in criminal or delinquent subcultures
(Blumer, 1967; Robins, et al., 1970; Kaplan, 1971; Weitzner, et
al., 1971). Still others suggest that marihuana use is more
likely to develop among persons living in underprivileged
communities or within a social structure that limits achievement
and advancement (Asuni, 1964; Blumer, 1967; Goode, 1972). </p>

<p>In recent years, considerable evidence has been gathered to
suggest that the use of other drugs and association with
drug-using friends are also likely to enhance the probability of
marihuana use (Hochman and Brill, 1971; Goode, 1972; Abelson, et
al., 1972). </p>

<p>Because many of these characteristics are likely' to be
associated with both criminal or delinquent behavior and
marihuana, use, some individuals have mistakenly concluded a.
cause-effect relationship rather than a statistical correlation. </p>

<p>The studies reviewed in the following pages axe probably the
most methodologically adequate assessments of the. purported
relationship between marihuana and crime undertaken to date. The
data show that the seemingly significant statistical correlation
often observed between marihuana, use and crime is spurious; it
is dependent not on the chemical effects of the drug but upon the
operation of several extra-pharmacological variables which have
little or nothing to do with the use of marihuana. per se. </p>

<p>The first of these studies (Goode, 1970) is based on a sample
of marihuana users. Because it, like the study by Robins and his
colleagues (1967, 1970) referred to earlier, involves a selected
population, the extent to which its findings can be applied to
the general population remains speculative. </p>

<p>The second study presented, a Commission sponsored survey of
young male urban dwellers, is probably the most adequate
assessment to date of the relationship between marihuana use and
crime. The results are based on a representative sample of the
general population of males, 15 to 34 years of age, the self
reports of criminal behavior have been cross-checked with
Philadelphia Police Department files; and numerous statistical
controls have been applied to the data. The study therefore
provides at least tentative answers to the following questions: </p>

<p>-Do young, male marihuana users and nonusers in the general
population differ significantly in the nature and extent of their
criminal activities? </p>

<p>-Is marihuana use, in and of itself, the principal determinant
of any observed differences? -If not, what are the variables
which explain a statistical correlation between marihuana use and
crime? </p>

<p>Goode, 1970. Between February and September of 1967,
face-to-face interviews were held with 204 marihuana users
residing in the New York City Metropolitan Area. The sample,
admittedly nonrepresentative, was drawn front membership lists of
drug-related organizations and also included friends and
acquaintances of the researcher. </p>

<p>The sample, suspected of differing to some unknown extent from
a random sample of marihuana users, can be characterized -as
primarily male (53%), young (median age 22 years), white (89.5%),
single (78%), middle class urban dwellers, including students,
dropouts, business people, housewives and the unemployed (p.
316). </p>

<p>All of the respondents, by virtue of their marihuana use,
possession or sale, had engaged in law violative behavior, but,
only nine marihuana arrests were reported. This finding indicates
that persons who are arrested for marihuana related activities
constitute only a small fraction of total marihuana users. </p>

<p>Because of their marihuana-related criminal activity, one
would expect that persons in this sample would have a higher
probability of being arrested than would the &quot;average&quot;
person from the general population. To determine if, in fact,
this might be the case, the researcher computed the rate of
arrest for his sample and compared it with the national rate of
arrest provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the
year 1965. Despite the fact that the rates are not strictly
comparable (the sample rate is based on arrests ever experienced;
the national rate is based on the number of arrests recorded for
one year), the similarity is striking. The national rate was
given as 3.7 per 100; the sample rate was computed to be 3.9 per
100 per year, 4.5 if one adds the marihuana arrests (p. 236). </p>

<p>Although the arrest, rates of the users and the general
population were found to be roughly similar, the types of crimes
committed by the users differed significantly from those crimes
recorded for the population as a whole. In contrast to the
majority of drunkenness and disorderly conduct charges noted for
the general population, the offenses of the users most often
resulting in arrest involved participation in political
demonstrations (19 out of the 55 arrests). No other single
offense attracted more, than a few arrests (p. 2335). </p>

<p>In addition to examining arrest rates and the types of
offenses committed, the researcher also investigated the
relationship between the amount of marihuana smoked and the
criminal behavior of the user. If it were true that marihuana did
produce a dangerous and criminogenic state in the user, the
greater would be his likelihood of committing crimes and of being
arrested. </p>

<p>The data, however, show no relationship; excluding the
&quot;political crimes&quot; (which were most common among the
least frequent smokers and least common among the most frequent
smokers), the &quot;serious&quot; crimes committed by 15
respondents (non-marihuana narcotics possession, disorderly
conduct, drunkenness, burglary, theft, assault, auto theft,
serving liquor to a minor and larceny) resulted in a total of 21
arrests. The heavy smokers did not commit these crimes
significantly more frequently than did the light smokers. </p>

<p>Similarly, there was no relationship found between the
frequency of use and the likelihood of arrest; three of the daily
smokers, three of those who smoked three to six times per week,
three who smoked one or two times weekly, one who smoked four
times monthly and three who were less than monthly smokers were
arrested for committing these &quot;serious&quot; crimes (pp.
237-38). </p>

<p>The researcher concludes that: </p>

<p><i>Although these numbers are extremely small, the fact of
their perfect dispersal is perhaps indicative of the lack of a
crime-inducing effect of the drug. It is, at any rate, a
proposition which ought to be tested more systematically in the
future with more complete data. For the moment, there are
indications that point to the fact that the marijuana smoker is
no more criminal than the rest of the population </i>(p. 238). </p>

<p>Goode, 1972. The Commission-sponsored Philadelphia survey set
out to resolve these issues. Goode (1972) analyzed the data
collected during August of 1971 from an interview survey of 559
15-to-34-year-old residents of West Philadelphia. </p>

<p>That part of the report devoted specifically to the analysis
of the data is presented in its entirety below. The only
deletions made were the author' references to previous studies
bearing on the issues addressed, the findings of which have been
presented earlier in this chapter. </p>

<p><b>Excerpts From </b></p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA USE AND CRIME* </b></p>

<p><b>PREFACE</b> </p>

<p>*Prepared by Professor Erich Goode for the National Commission
on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, January 15, 1972. The data on which
this report is based were obtained from a survey conducted by the
Institute of Survey Research of Temple University. All tables
referred to in Professor Goode's text are found at the end of
these excerpts. 'The interview schedule was developed and
executed and the data processed for the Commission by Temple
University's Institute for Survey Research, in Philadelphia.<br>
</p>

<p>The data analyzed in this report were gathered in August 1971
by the Institute for Survey Research of Temple University In
Philadelphia; the author of this report did not have a hand in
any phase of the data gathering, including constructing the
interview schedule, although he is solely responsible for the
data analysis. The sample consists in toto of males age 15
through 34 living in households located in a section of West
Philadelphia. Each respondent was interviewed; a total sample
size of 559 was collected. (The refusal rate was 10%, which is
typical for house-to-house surveys of this type.) The area in
which the sample was drawn is composed mainly of two
heterogeneous populations: lower-middle and working-class, high
school educated blacks, and college-associated whites-students
and professionals associated with [Drexel University and] the
University of Pennsylvania. About four respondents in ten in this
survey are black, and just over half are white. (The number of
Orientals and Puerto Ricans or Mexicans is too small to permit a
meaningful statistical analysis, so that when race is discussed
in this report, only the black-white comparison will be made.)
The racial composition is roughly equivalent to the census
figures for the sample area although no attempt was made, through
a weighting of cases, to &quot;correct&quot; any discrepancies
which might have prevailed in population composition. More
detailed information is available from the Institute for Survey
Research. </p>

<p>A quarter of the sample (23%) had never smoked marijuana; in
17 cases (3%), no information on marijuana use was given by the
respondent. Of the marijuana users the question asked about
frequency of use during the respondent's most recent year of
use-about 1 in 10 smoked marijuana daily or more, about 1 in 5
smoked approximately once or twice a week, 1 in 4 smoked once or
twice per month, on the average, and about 4 in 10 smoked
marijuana several times a year. (The study also asked how often
the respondent smoked marijuana in his first year of use a
variable which I have not made use of in this report.) Questions
were also asked concerning the respondent's use of other
drugs-&quot;stimulants or uppers, such as bennies, speed, or
dex,&quot; &quot;sedatives or downers, such as sleeping pills,
amytal or blues, or nembutal, or yellow jackets,&quot;
&quot;hallucinatory drugs, such as LSD, mescaline, or STP,&quot;
and &quot;hard drugs, such as heroin, morphine, demerol, cocaine,
or codeine.&quot; In addition, questions on one's friends' drug
use-both marijuana and these other drugs--were asked. </p>

<p>The commission of various offenses formed another segnient of
the questionnaire. There were 16 of them, and ranged from those
which would not be considered crimes in most instances-such as
&quot;disturbing people&quot;-to those which would be considered
felonies, drawing long prison sentences such :as rape, armed
robbery, and assault. As would be expected], the serious offenses
were committed (or admitted to) by very, very few respondents-and
thus, any comparison between users and non-users has to be made
mainly on the basis of committing trivial offenses.... </p>

<hr>

<p><b>III. THE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>At this point, I will introduce the data from the Philadelphia
marijuana use and crime study, specifically mandated by the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. This survey's
data will form the bulk of the factual evidence on the
marijuana-crime connection in the report which follows. </p>

<p>The question of marijuana's relationship to crime and
aggressive behavior is obviously closely related to the drug's
effects. One of the most fundamental generalizations in
psychopharmacology to be obtained from thousands of recent
research efforts is that the same drug does not have standard and
invariant &quot;effects,&quot; but that effects are sensitive to
a number of extra-pharmacological variables, including the
personality of the user, the social setting in which drug, use
takes place, the user's past experience with the drug, his
expectations, and so on. Thus, it is elliptical and somewhat
artificial, and incomplete, to speak of any drug's
&quot;effects,&quot; as if they occurred under any and all
conditions, in all users. We should bear this qualification in
mind when looking at the relationship between the ingestion of a
drug and any subsequent behavior-with the latter supposedly
&quot;,Caused&quot; by the effects of the drug. Drug effects
vary, and, in addition, even standard effects do not
automatically translate into specific forms of human behavior.
Even opposite forms of behavior could follow the same effects,
given different individuals taking the drug, different settings
in which the drug is used, different definitions of the drug and
its use and so on.... </p>

<p>The data collected by the Philadelphia survey on the
subjective effects of marijuana dovetail precisely with those of
earlier studies. The effects agreed to by the users in the sample
are clearly inconsistent with aggressive behavior. This does not
mean that marijuana cannot be related to the commission of
criminal or aggressive acts-but it does suggest that the effects
of marijuana, per se, may have nothing to do with the commission
of crimes, especially violent crimes. Table 1 summarizes the
results from this survey's question on marijuana's effects, which
was: &quot;I am going to read to you some of the ways using
marijuana may affect people. For each could you tell me whether
marijuana had this effect on you almost every time, more than
half the time, less than half the time, or never or almost never,
when using marijuana.&quot; The effects asked about were related
to feelings generally thought of as criminogenic either in a
positive or a negative direction. Those that are generally
considered to be related to crimes deal with anger and
frustration, or with derangement, or with suggestibility. Those
inversely related to the commission of crimes and aggressive acts
dealt with relaxation and sleepiness. </p>

<p>As can be readily seen from Table 1, users overwhelmingly deny
that marijuana has effects on them which could be interpreted as
criminogenic or violent in nature. Nearly all respondents
specifically denied that aggressive feelings came over them
during the marijuana intoxication. When asked whether, under the
influence of marijuana, they had a feeling of wanting to hurt
someone, 96% said that this occurred never or almost never. When
asked whether they had feelings of wanting to do something
violent, 95% said never or almost never. Almost nine in 10 (88%)
said that they never or almost never felt more angry when high.
And almost eight in 10 (78%) said that they never or almost never
felt frustrated when tinder the influence. Thus, the
frustration-anger-aggressive impulse syndrome seems to be an
extremely rare phenomenon associated with the marijuana
intoxication. Likewise, the suggestibility syndrome does not
appear to be characteristic, although it seems to be somewhat
more common than aggressive feelings. About six in 10 (or 59%) of
the respondents said that they had a feeling of &quot;being more
willing to follow other people's suggestions,&quot; never or
almost never. And about three-quarters (77%) said that they had a
&quot;feeling of being able to do anything,&quot; never or almost
never. Those sensations, however, which would be seen as
inhibiting criminal and aggressive im pulses and acts were
decidedly more common, Exactly half of the respondents said that
they felt &quot;a feeling of relaxation&quot; almost all the
time. About a third (31%) said that they felt less angry than
usual almost all the time. About a fifth (22%) felt drowsy and
sleepy almost all the time-and another quarter (25%) felt this
more than half the time. </p>

<p>These data suggest-but do not demonstrate-that the effects of
marijuana per se are probably not related in any meaningful or
causal manner to aggressive or criminal acts. They give us a
clue, but do not prove, that in and of itself, marijuana use does
not &quot;cause&quot; the commission of criminal acts. In fact,
if we were to look at the subjective effects of marijuana
themselves, they appear to point in exactly the opposite
direction-they would seem to inhibit crime, indeed, activity of
all kinds. The effect of marijuana would be more in the direction
of reducing than stimulating aggressive, criminal or violent
activity. </p>

<p>Two final qualifications would appear to be in order before I
explore the marijuana-crime link more systematically and fully.
One has to do with the length of time that the marijuana
Intoxication lasts. Two facts bear on this issue. First, each
episode of use generally produces an intoxication which lasts
roughly three or four hours, at the most. Marijuana's effects
wear off about three hours or so after the user smokes the drug.
Secondly, from previous studies ... as well as the survey whose
data I am analyzing In this report, it is clear that the average,
or median, level of marijuana use Is roughly once a week. This
means that the typical marijuana user is under the influence
about three or four hours per week, or roughly 3% or so of his
waking hours, and under a &quot;normal&quot; state of mind the
remaining 97%. Now, it is possible that this tiny segment of time
would influence some users in some significant way, but the fact
of its briefness of duration ought to be kept in mind when
reasoning about the impact of the drug on the lives of users. The
daily user comprises roughly one marijuana user out of 10, and
the individual who is high all, or nearly all, of his waking
hours, probably constitutes about I or 2% of all marijuana
smokers. These facts cannot be ignored in our exploration of the
causal connection between the effects of marijuana and criminal
activities. </p>

<p>And the last issue I will raise in the marijuana effects topic
has to do with the truthfulness of the answers given by users. A
plausible objection to taking the word of users concerning the
effects of the drug on them would be that they are
untrustworthy-that they have a motive for lyIng, for portraying
the drug and their experiences in a positive light. Actually,
what nearly all researchers have found in an interview situation
with drug users is that they very rarely lie; in fact, their
honesty about themselves and their activities and experiences
appears to be the rule, overwhelmingly. . . . </p>

<p>The overall picture that we receive from . . . various studies
is that, like most interview subjects, marijuana users may
occasionally lie or hide the truth, but their answers will, in
general, be truthful. This does not mean that everything they say
must be taken at face value-as with any other group of
interviewees, anything which the researcher is capable of
checking independently, and which we have data on, we should
corroborate with what we learn in the interview situation. At the
same time, we would be as fallacious in assuming that everything
that marijuana smoker-, said to be true is suspect as if we
accepted everything they said to be true in all respects. What
all of this means is that we must reason with caution from
self-reported data, use them whenever we must, and check them
whenever we can. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IV. CRIMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Philadelphia survey on marijuana use and crime asked
several questions concerning 16 different offenses. The questions
began as follows: &quot;'Many people in every community commit
acts which others consider offenses, delinquent acts, and
violations. Here is a list of these acts.&quot; The specific
questions dealt with whether the respondent had ever committed
each one, how often, how old lie was when the offense occurred,
whether lie was caught by the police, and whether the respondent
had been drinking, or was under the influence of marijuana, 24
hours or less before committing the act-as well as whether the
respondent thought that using marijuana influenced him to commit
the act; these questions were asked about the first as well as
the most recent such of. fense, if they occurred. The offenses
were: hurting someone in a minor way, hurting someone badly,
carrying a knife. stealing a car, disturbing people, threatening
to hurt someone, taking money, stealing from a store, making an
obscene telephone call, forcing sexual intercourse with a woman,
breaking into a house or store, damaging property, buying stolen
property, setting off an alarm, carrying a gun, and using a
weapon to steal. From these facts, it might be interesting to
find out what proportion of acts involved some drug use occurring
within 24 hours-and whether that drug is alcohol or marijuana. I
will explain after the data are presented what these facts can
and cannot tell us. We must not be too hasty in reading too much
into any given set of data. </p>

<p>Table 2 presents summary information from this set of
questions. I have presented figures for only six offenses:
stealing from a store, damaging property, hurting someone in a
minor way, breaking into a house or store, stealing a ear, and
hurting someone badly. Some of the crimes asked about were
committed by so few respondents (such as forcing sexual
intercourse) that any statistical analysis would be completely
meaningless. Other offenses seem to be unrelated to the
aggressive syndrome associated with marijuana use-such as buying
stolen property. The six I have chosen are, in any case,
representative. Tile first three are relatively minor, and would
usually be classified by the law as misdemeanors; the second two
are considerably more serious, and would often be classified as
felonies. Table 2 presents the proportion who drank alcohol, and
smoked marijuana 24 hours or fewer before the crime was
committed; the figures in the first two columns are for the first
time the respondent committed the offense, and the second two
columns are for the most recent time, if it occurred more than
once. </p>

<p>What generalizations may we make front Table 2? </p>

<p>First of all, committing these crimes is atypical. Not one
these six offenses was committed by a majority of the sample.
Secondly the more serious the offense, the less likely it was to
be committed. Minor offenses were committed at least once by
between four and five out of every 10 respondents, but major
offenses had been committed at least once by something like one
respondent in 25. (And two of the offenses not in the table were
rarer still; forcing sexual intercourse was admitted to by six
respondents, or about one in 100, and using a weapon to steal was
reported by only three respondents, or one out of 200.) </p>

<p>What about drugs and crime? Compared with not being under the
influence, drugs tend to be atypical in the commission of crimes.
For none of these categories, whether first offense or most
recent, was being under the influence of either alcohol or
marijuana characteristic of over a quarter of all offenses, and
most are considerably below this. Most crimes here were committed
when the offender was not under the influence of any drug,
marijuana, or alcohol, when lie was in a &quot;normal&quot; state
of mind pharmacologically.* Secondly, in terms of absolute
incidence, alcohol is involved in the commission of crime
considerably more often than marijuana. Adding together all of
the offenses committed 24 hours before each drug was used,
alcohol had been used in conjunction with first offenses a total
of 47 times, and marijuana only five times-a ratio of not quite
ten to one. For the most recent offenses, alcohol was involved a
total of 66 times, and marihuana 19--a ratio of about three to
one. </p>

<p>In conjunction with this point, it should be stressed that the
classic, aggressive, violent crimes traditionally and
historically associated with the marijuana intoxication are very,
very rarely committed-by anyone, high or normal, user or non-user
alike. Six men in this survey admitted to forcing a woman to have
intercourse with him as a first offense, and three admitted to
rape more than the first time. In two out of the six first-time
cases, the offender said that he had been drinking 24 hours
before, and in one out of the three most recent-time cases,
drinking was involved as well. But in none of the six first time
cases, and in none of the three recent-time cases, had anyone
smoked marijuana 24 hours before. (None of the men had been
apprehended for this offense, incidentally.) Only three of the
men in the survey said that they had used a weapon to steal as a
first offense, and two admitted this offense more than the one
time-and none said that lie had either drunk or smoked 24 hours
before the offense. </p>

<p>*Several facts should he born in mind when considering this
generalization. First of all, the survey asked about the use of
each drug 24 hours before the offense was committed or less-and
hence, the respondent was not necessarily under the influence
when the offense was committed, although certainly many
respondents were under the influence at that time. Secondly,
anyone who uses marijuana is far more likely to become
intoxicated with each episode of use than is true of each episode
of alcohol use. </p>

<p>Considering the fact that the typical marijuana smoker in this
study had been intoxicated several hundred times for a total of
well over a thousand hours, and therefore in a state of mind
which, if the &quot;causal&quot; theory is correct, is aggressive
and criminogenic, then this almost total absence of violent and
aggressive crimes committed by users should be puzzling. This
fact indicates that the &quot;causal&quot; theory may be
inadequate and erroneous. </p>

<p>However, it is not possible to tell from Table 2 whether the
commission of crimes is more frequent for alcohol or marijuana on
a relative basis during the period of intoxication. That is, if
anyone wanted to know whether a thousand hours of a marijuana or
an alcohol intoxication was more like to result in the commission
of various crimes, this table would not convey this information.
Unfortunately, this survey did not ask a question on the
frequency with which the respondents drank alcohol or, indeed,
whether they drank at all so that an alcohol -marijuana
comparison cannot be more systematically made. It is entirely
possible that alcohol-related crimes are far more frequent than
marijuana-related crimes. simply because alcohol is still, even
in this sample, probably the drug of choice among young people,
and is more often used than marijuana (just as not being under
tile influence of any drug is more frequently involved with
crimes than being under the influence, simply because most
people, most of the time, are not intoxicated). As to which drug
is more &quot;criminogenic&quot; in the sense of what proportion
of the time under the influence of marijuana vs. alcohol one
commits various crimes cannot be determined from the data from
this study. However, in absolute terms, alcohol is considerably
more often used before crimes than marijuana. </p>

<p>Another generalization that may be made from Table 2 is that
the contribution of marijuana from first offense to most recent
offense grows somewhat relative to alcohol. That is, for the
first offense, alcohol is used before it about 10 times as
frequently as is marijuana, but for most recent offense, alcohol
is only three times as frequent. This probably is a reflection of
the following two trends: (1) Marijuana smoking is considerably
more frequent today (i.e., closest in time when the most recent
offense occurred) titan a few years ago (i.e., closest in time
when the first offense occurred), and hence, its frequency
relative to alcohol would be greater in conjunction with any
activity-criminal or non-criminal as well-simply because its use
is more common ; (2) Marijuana smoking is more common among young
adults (the age group most closely represented by the age when
last offense was committed) than among adolescents and
preadolescents (the age group most closely represented by the age
when first offense was committed) and, moreover, as age rises,
marijuana use rises faster than alcohol use rises, at least up,
until early adulthood. . . . </p>

<p>It is possible that, as marijuana usage increases, the number
of crimes committed under the influence of this drug may increase
as well. However, the question as to marijuana's direct
contribution to the commission of crimes, especially aggressive
crimes, is ail independent issue, and one in need of exploration.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>V. WHO COMMITS CRIMES AND WHO DOESN'T?<br>
</b></p>

<p>In this section, it is our job to explore two basic issues: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Do marijuana users commit crimes and offenses any more
        frequently titan non-users do? </li>
    <li>Are any variables with which marijuana use is strongly
        related also correlated with criminality? </li>
</ol>

<p>In the next section I will deal with a third question, and one
which is probably the most crucial one in this report: Can the
marijuana-crime connection be explained mainly by the use of
marijuana in and of itself, or is use itself dependent on third
variables which themselves explain the commission of offenses? </p>

<p>As the principal measure of committing crimes, this study has
employed the number of different types of offenses admitted to in
the 16 categories asked about. Naturally, there are many other
crimes not asked about, and, in addition, some of these crimes
would not correspond to the image most people would have of
&quot;classic&quot; aggressive offenses-such as &quot;disturbing
people,&quot; or receiving stolen goods. However, as a general
index or overall measure of criminality of different groups or
categories of individuals, this one is as good as any others that
have been employed, and is probably adequate for our purposes.
(The survey, it must be noted, did not ask questions about any
white collar crimes, which must be reckoned into an adequate
measure of output of criminal behavior-but these crimes do not
correspond with the public's image of aggressive crimes committed
under the influence of marijuana, and so their absence is less
relevant than would appear at first glance.) Throughout the
remainder of this report, the number of crimes and offenses will
be employed as the dependent variable-the outcome to be
explained. And throughout, I will be examining the
marijuana-crime connection-as well as other relationships-insofar
as it bears on file basic issue. </p>

<p>Before the analysis proceeds, it should be pointed out that of
the 16 offenses, not one of the violent crimes correlated with
marijuana use in any meaningful way at all, and a very weak
relationship was evidenced with only five of the
offenses-stealing from a store, buying stolen property,
disturbing people, damaging property, and hurting someone in a
minor way (the last of which showing the weakest association of
all). The statistical differences in rates of offenses between
users and non-users rest on adding together a small number of
weakly correlated offenses. When offense differences are
discussed, the reader should not hold the mistaken impression
that they indicate massive differences, or differences indicating
a higher rate of classic, violent crimes among users. With that
warning in mind, we may now proceed to user/non-user differences
in offenses. </p>

<p>The first relationship to be presented, then, is whether
marijuana users as a whole commit offenses any more frequently
than non-users as a whole. The answer is yes. I have employed two
indicators of marijuana use; one is frequency of marijuana use
during the period of most recent use (which may have been in the
past, or may be at present), and whether or not the respondent
has ever, or has never, used marijuana. Both indicators of
marijuana use correlate very powerfully with committing offenses.
For both tables, the differences are significant beyond the .001
level, employing Chi-square as a test of significance, which
means that the differences observed could occur at random only
one chance in a thousand. This is considered extremely
significant. There is a regular and step-wise relationship
between frequency of use and committing offenses; the more that a
given respondent smokes marijuana, the greater is the likelihood
that lie will have committed four or more offenses, and the lower
is his likelihood of committing no offenses at all. Over a third
(38%) of those who have never smoked marijuana said that they
committed none of the 16 offenses asked about-but this was true
of only one respondent in eight (or 12%) of the regular smokers.
At the other end, there was a 17% difference between non-users
and regular users (24% vs. 41%) in admitting to four or more of
these offenses. Tables 3 and 4 present these data in detail. </p>

<p>We would be remiss in our duties as sensitive and acute social
analysts if we ended the analysis there. The simple correlation
between marijuana use and offenses may very well mask important
and even more basic relationships buried beneath it. Marijuana is
correlated in a simple manner with the commission of crimes,, but
does it remain correlated when controls are applied? In other
words, is it a spurious relationship, or one which will remain
when crucial variables are held constant' Which-factors are also
related to the commission of offenses-which might actually
themselves explain the simple marijuana-crime connection? There
are several such variables-race, age, education, the use of other
drugs, and the respondent's involvement in the drug subculture.
Blacks are significantly less likely to use marijuana (64% of the
blacks in the survey said that they had tried marijuana, but 86%
of the whites said that they had done so), but slightly more
likely to admit to the commission of offenses--41% of all blacks
said that they committed four or more offenses but this was true
of only 25 ) % of all whites (see Tables 23 and 25). Does the
marijuana-crime correlation hold up for blacks and whites
separately? Age was also related to both offenses and marijuana.
The oldest respondents (age 29-34) were least likely to have
tried marijuana (61%), the youngest (15-20) were next least
(73%), and the intermediate age groups (21-23 and 24-28) were
most likely to have tried marijuana (82% and 80%). There was a
linear relationship between age and offenses, however. The
youngest group was least likely to have committed no offenses
(20%), and most likely to have committed four or more (42%) ; the
oldest group was most likely to, have committed no offenses
(35%), and least likely to have committed four or more (22%) (see
Tables 29-31). Thus, we would want to know whether marijuana and
crime still correlate in each age group separately. The same
thing can be said for education (Tables 26-28), the use of drugs
other than marijuana (Tables 11-16), and having friends who use
drugs (Tables 17-22)-the relationship between marijuana use and
crime could be mitigated or even transformed altogether if these
third variables are considered. One possibility is that the
marijuana-crime relationship is wiped out altogether with the
application of these controls-that is, that the relationship is
completely spurious. A second possibility is that the
marijuana-crime connection may be specific to some groups or
categories, but not others. And the third possibility is that the
same original relationship remains basically unaltered, or even
is strengthened, by the application of these controls. </p>

<p>Special attention ought to be paid to the drug-related
variables. There is a powerful and significant association
between the use of marijuana and the use of other drugs. Although
recent studies have presented evidence that this basic
relationship is probably not due to the effects of marijuana per
se, but to friendships and associations made in conjunction with
marihuana use . . . , the simple relationship between marihuana
and other drugs is a statistical fact. There is, in addition, a
strong and marked association with using drugs other than
marijuana and the commission of crimes. Thus, a legitimate
question to be explored is whether &quot;marijuana only&quot;
users have a greater crime rate than non-users, whether the
higher rate of the commission of offenses cannot be attributed
largely or solely to using drugs other than marijuana. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>VI. MARIJUANA USE AND CRIME: CAUSAL OR SPURIOUS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Our first clue as to the nature of the underlying relationship
between marijuana use and crime is obtained by examining Table 5,
which documents the association between number of offenses and
marijuana use, taking into account the use of other drugs as
well. Table 5 shows that &quot;marijuana only&quot; marijuana
users are only very slightly more likely to commit crimes than
non-users. Tire original nine percentage point difference between
users and non-users in committing four or more offenses has
shrunk to only two percentage points (in fact, only one
percentage point--we are comparing 24.4% with 25.5%, and the
original 19 percentage point difference between users and
non-users in committing no offenses has been reduced to 13
percentage points. In fact, the &quot;marijuana only&quot; user
is far more similar to the non-user in number of offenses
committed than he is to the user of marijuana plus two or more
other drugs. The application of the control involving other drugs
clearly attenuates the marijuana-crime relationship, and much of
the user-non-user differences in offenses committed can be traced
to the fact that marijuana users are significantly more likely to
use other drugs, rather than the use of marijuana per se.* </p>

<p>*The exploration of the &quot;escalation&quot; hypothesis-the
question of whether or not marijuana &quot;leads to&quot; the use
of other more dangerous drugs-would take us far afield in this
report. The issue is dealt with in a separate report by the
author prepared for the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse, however. </p>

<p>Our confidence in the lack of basic association between
marijuana use itself and offenses--and our ability to attribute
the simple original relationship to the use of drugs other than
marijuana-is strengthened when we examine the relationship
between frequency of use and offenses, holding the use of other
drugs constant. Table 5A presents these data. Among
&quot;marijuana only&quot; users, there is no statistically
significant correlation between frequency of use and the
commission of crimes--the differences are small, insignificant,
and in no consistent direction. Among users of one other drug,
likewise, frequency of marijuana use is extremely loosely
associated with committing offenses-the differences which are
observed are small, statistically insignificant, and point in no
particular direction. And lastly, among users of two or more
other drugs aside from marijuana, the association between
frequency of marijuana use and the commission of the offenses
described earlier is loose and not at all significant. Table 5A
very strongly indicates the validity of the &quot;spurious&quot;
model. </p>

<p>Closely related to the use of other drugs is a control which
should be explored: the respondent's involvement with a
drug-using subculture-with others who also use drugs. Naturally,
as we saw in the last section, individuals who use marijuana tend
to have friends who also use marijuana. What we would like to
know is whether the social patterns they exhibit can be traced to
their use of the drug. or to the fact that they have friends who
use drugs. Thus, we should be very interested in looking at the
individual who uses marijuana, but who does riot have drug-using
friends, as well as the individual who does riot rise marijuana,
but has drug-using friends. If interesting changes take place in
the original marijuana-crime correlation, then we have
indications that it is the individual's social relations, and not
his rise of marijuana, per se, that determine marijuana use's
correlation with crime. Tables 6 and 7 deal with this issue; they
should be examined in conjunction with one another. </p>

<p>Among respondents with no marijuana-using friends (out of
their 10 closest friends). as well as those with no drug-using
friends at all. almost an identical relationship between
marijuana use and crime obtains as in the original Table 3.
Marijuana users are, significantly (but not strikingly) more
likely to commit four or more offenses, and significantly less
likely to commit none. The percentage differences in Tables 6 and
7 are almost the same (even slightly more) as those in Table.
3-about 25% at the &quot;none&quot; end vs. 19% for the original
table, and about 18% at the &quot;four or more&quot; end vs. 9%
for the original table (Table 3). If we were to rely only on
these segments of the table, we would be led to the, inference
that marijuana is meaningfully related to the commission of
crimes. </p>

<p>However, an extraordinary thing happens to the other segments
of the table: among those with drug-using friends, there is no
relationship at all between marijuana use and committing
offenses. The differences are so small as to be statistically
insignificant. (And they are actually in the opposite
direction-non-users are slightly more likely to commit four or
more offenses than users are.) In other words the marijuana-crime
relationship is completely wiped out by the application of
controls-in this case, integration into the drug-using
subculture. We are led overwhelmingly to the conclusion that
marijuana users tend to be somewhat more likely to commit crimes
solely because they are part of a drug-using subculture; the
actual properties of marijuana appear to be completely
unassociated with criminal behavior. Anyone (whether he uses
marijuana or not) who makes friends and becomes involved with
others who use drugs-especially others who use drugs in addition
to and aside from marijuana stands a higher likelihood of
committing offenses, simply because this segment of the
population tends to be more lax about obeying the law. It is
merely because marijuana users tend to associate with others who
are part of this subculture that their crime rate is somewhat
higher. In other words, the marijuana-crime relationship-in terms
of the causal or effects model is completely spurious. </p>

<p>What of the marijuana-using isolate? What of those who use
marijuana but who have no friends who use drugs-either marijuana
or other drugs? How can we explain the fact that the original
difference in offense rate between users and non-users were not
wiped out among those without drug-using friends-in contrast to
being wiped out among those who had drug-using friends? Looking
back at Tables 6 and 7, we are struck by the fact that the
offense rate of the marijuana-using group without drug-using
friends is as high as the groups with drug using friends. What
does this indicate? First of all, involvement with a drug-rising
subculture is clearly not the only determinant of a high rate of
committing offenses. Probably something else is at work. The fact
that the offense differences wash out among those involved with
the drug subculture indicates that rise by itself (i.e., being
high) cannot be a factor in the original marijuana-crime
relationships difference cannot explain two things that are
similar. The using isolate, however, is probably a (Qualitatively
different social being from those who either do not rise, or
those who use and have friends who also use. The isolate is
probably deviant in a variety of ways crime being one of them.
The fact that he uses in spite of having no friends who use
(although lie may have friends who do not use) means that he uses
most of the time alone. has not integrated his activities into a
social life or a subculture, and probably pursues some activities
which the dominant society would judge to be eccentric and
unusual. In other words, it is possible that his involvement with
crime is related to his social isolation from a group which
pursues drug activities similar to his own, rather than his use
of marijuana. However, these remarks must be regarded as
speculation, since more complete information is not available. </p>

<p>A related process occurs when race is employed as the control
variable. Among blacks, the original relationship remains intact;
marijuana users are significantly (although not markedly) more
likely to commit four or more offenses, and less likely to commit
none, than is true of non-users. (The relationship is significant
at the .004 level, using Chi-square.) However, among whites, the
original relationship is completely washed out; users are not at
all more likely to commit offenses. Table 8 presents these data.
The minor differences can be completely accounted for by random
fluctuations; the relationship is not significant at any level. </p>

<p>When education is treated as the control variable in this
relationship, the marijuana-crime connection follows a pattern
parallel to the two previous explorations-that is, it is
completely washed out for some groups, but remains for others. In
Table 9, we see that marijuana users who have at least attended
college, but not graduate school, are not any more likely to
commit offenses than college non-users. The percentages
committing four or more crimes, and those committing none, are
almost identical for users and non-users alike. (The differences
are insignificant, and due to random fluctuation.) However, among
respondents with only a high school education, the same basic
relationship produced in Table 3 is upheld: marijuana users are
significantly more likely to have committed offenses than
non-users. However, at least two variables are compounded here,
since most respondents with a college education are white. Thus,
the retainment of the original marijuana-crime correlation among
high school education respondents, and its wash-out among college
educated respondents, should not come as any surprise. However,
among respondents with at least some graduate school education,
the original relationship asserts itself; users are more likely
to commit offenses than non-users. (The differences observed are
significant at the .05 level; in other words, the differences
have a one in 20 chance of occurring purely at random.) Table 9
presents the marijuana-crime relationship, holding education
constant. </p>

<p>Using age as a control variable also produces mixed results.
Among the two youngest age groups (15--20 and 21-23), the
differences obtaining between users and nonusers are
statistically insignificant, and could have occurred by chance
alone; in the youngest of these two groups, the non-user is
slightly more likely to have committed four or more offenses, and
in the next to youngest of these groups, the user is slightly
more so--but in both, the differences are too small to be
meaningful. In the 24-to-28-year-old group, the differences
approach statistical significance, but they are not substantial
(.07 level of significance, using Chi-square). However, among the
oldest group (age 29 to 34), the same basic difference in
offenses as obtained in the original relationship holds up here;
users are about twice as likely to have committed four or more
offenses as non-users (28% vs. 13%), and less than half as likely
to have committed no offenses (21% vs. 58&amp;). These data
appear in Table 10. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>The central effort in this report has been to determine
whether marijuana use, in and of itself, is meaningfully and
causally related to the commission of crime. Two models have been
used in the past to answer this issue: the causal model, which
holds that using marijuana, being under the influence of the
drug, actually does stimulate the will to commit antisocial acts,
and the spurious model, which holds that marijuana use is merely
a reflection of independent and more powerful forces, and that in
itself, marijuana use is unrelated to criminal and aggressive
behavior. Some small amount of research has been conducted in the
past on this issue, but no consistent findings have been turned
up; . . . It is because of these factual lacunae that the
National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse mandated a study
of marijuana use and crime, which culminated in the Philadelphia
survey, as well as this report. </p>

<p>The findings from this study strongly support the view that
marijuana, use by itself is not related in any meaningful or
systematic fashion to criminal behavior, that marijuana use
probably does not &quot;cause criminiality. The
&quot;spurious&quot; model appears to be a far more accurate
description of the marijuana-crime connection than does the
&quot;causal&quot; model. The use of marijuana per se is probably
completely unrelated to criminal and aggressive behavior. The
drug does not &quot;cause&quot; any significant number of users
to commit crimes, or aggressive or violent behavior. The effects
of the drug seem to be, from what can be gathered from the
available data on the question, without criminogenic causality.
This does not mean that it is not possible to commit crimes,
including aggressive crimes, under the influence of marijuana-but
that being high does not increase one's probability of doing so,
that on an hour-for-hour, crime-for-crime basis, there are
probably no significant differences between being intoxicated on
marijuana and being &quot;normal,&quot; not under the influence
of any drug. </p>

<p>A wide variety of data have been brought to bear on the
marijuana-crime issue. </p>

<p>First of all, regarding the subjective self-reported effects
of marijuana, all indications are that the effects classically
described as being related to aggressive behavior and the
commissions crimes-feeling angry, frustrated, wanting to -hurt
someone, being willing to follow any and all suggestions of
others, being deranged, wanting to do something violent-have no
empirical support whatsoever; users consistently describe these
&quot;effects&quot; as non-existent or as extremely rare and
atypical, no different from normally. In fact, precisely the
opposite is the case: if anything, the effects of marijuana would
have far more to do with reducing the criminal
&quot;impulse,&quot; whatever that might be, due to the fact that
they tend to be in the direction of relaxation, feeling calm, of
not wanting to move about, feeling somewhat drowsy, sleepy.
Activity of any sort tends to be inhibited by the marijuana
intoxication. </p>

<p>Secondly, the Philadelphia survey asked the respondents about
using marijuana and/or alcohol 24 hours or less before various
crimes were committed. Marijuana very rarely figured into the
commission of crimes in any way. For only a tiny minority of all
crimes committed was the respondent under the influence. This was
especially the case for serious and aggressive crimes. Alcohol
was far more likely to be used soon before criminal activity than
marijuana. - </p>

<p>The third type of information brought to bear on the
marijuana-crime question was the self-admitted offense rate of
users versus non-users. The total number of different types of
crimes which respondents said that they had committed was
compared. The simple relationship between using marijuana and
committing offenses was positive and statistically significant,
and there was also a high correlation between frequency of
smoking marijuana and committing offenses. However, a wide range
of other variables, themselves related to both crime and to
marijuana use, were also correlated-race, education, age, the use
of other drugs, and having drug-using friends. Thus, the issue
became: is it the causal connection with these third variables
which produces the marijuana crime simple correlation, or does
the correlation hold up even when these factors are controlled?
In other words, which is right, the causal or tile, spurious
model? Is marijuana use merely dependent itself on larger,
broader, more potent factors-or does it exert an independent
power? Do users commit crimes more frequently than nonusers
because they use marijuana or because they happen to be the kinds
of people who, would have a higher crime rate, marijuana or no
marijuana. </p>

<p>The evidence from these three-variable tests support the
&quot;spurious&quot; model. The control tables show that the
differences in crime rate between users and non-users is, in most
cases, dependent not on marijuana use per se, but on these larger
factors. The fact that the relationship disappears, or is wiped
out, when some controls are applied shows that the
marijuana-crime connection is dependent on sociological
variables, and not chemical effects. When the use of other drugs
was held constant, the marijuana-crime correlation was severely
attenuated, and in some cases, washed out entirely. When the
variable of having friends who use other drugs-both marijuana as
well as stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens and &quot;hard
drugs&quot; was applied, the relationship disappeared among those
with drug-using friends, but not those who had no drug-using
friends. When race was held constant, the marijuana-crime
connection was wiped out completely among whites, but not blacks;
among white marijuana users, their crime rate was not
statistically different from non-users, but black users did have
a higher crime rate than non-using blacks-similar in magnitude to
the original relationship. When education was used as a control
variable, we saw that among college-educated respondents, the
marijuana-crime correlation was nonexistent, but it remained
among respondents with a high school education, and for those who
had attended graduate school. And lastly, age was applied as a
control. Among the youngest groups, the marijuana-crime
relationship was attenuated, but it remained somewhat strong
among the two oldest age categories. </p>

<p>If there were truly a causal relationship between marijuana
use and crime, these disappearing correlations would not occur.
The application of sociological variables cannot wash out a
chemical reaction in the user. The enormous variability dependent
on social factors indicates that marijuana effects do not
inherently produce behavior of a criminal nature. The kinds of
people who use the drug tend to follow Patterns of behavior
regardless of whether or not they use marijuana. By itself,
marijuana, use is not a potent producer of behavior, and
certainly not criminal behavior. Individuals who commit criminal
acts are those who would do so with or without the use of
marijuana. </p>

<p>The data from this study support-the conclusion, almost
without qualification, that marijuana use does not cause criminal
behavior.* </p>

<p>*A subsequent regression analysis with the six variables used
independently as controls showed that when all six variables are
applied simultaneously, the use of marijuana in and of itself
accounts for less than 1% of the variance in committing offenses
(personal communication by the author, 24 January 1972).<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Summary and Conclusions: Marihuana and Crime</h1>

<hr>

<p>The Commission's review of the available evidence bearing on
the relationship between marihuana use and criminal, aggressive
and delinquent behavior has yielded the following information. </p>

<p>The once prevalent belief among the general public and the
professional law enforcement, criminal justice and research
communities that marihuana causes crime, violence, aggression and
delinquency has moderated appreciably over the years. Recent
evidence indicates that increased attention has been devoted,
instead, to a possible statistical correlation rather than a
cause-effect relationship. </p>

<p>At present, however, considerable confusion and uncertainty
exists among both the general and professional publics, among
youth and adults, and among marihuana users and non-users about
the relationship between marihuana and criminal, aggressive or
delinquent behavior. The confusion and uncertainty stem from a
general lack of knowledge and understanding about the effects of
the drug, including its potential for physical addiction. Many
persons are still under the misapprehension that marihuana is
addicting and that crimes are committed in order to support a
drug &quot;habit.&quot; </p>

<p>In general, recent changes in public and professional opinion
have corresponded with and reflected the increased use of
marihuana, particularly within the middle class segment of
society; more direct observation of and professional experience
with the marihuana user; new and more enlightened information
about the drug and its effects; and concomitant changes in the
public image of the user. </p>

<p>There is no systematic empirical evidence, at least that drawn
from the American experience, to support the thesis that the use
of marihuana either inevitably or generally causes, leads to or
precipitates criminal, violent, aggressive or delinquent behavior
of a sexual or nonsexual nature. </p>

<p>Laboratory studies of effects have revealed no evidence to
show that marihuana's chemical properties are, by themselves,
capable of producing effects which can be interpreted as
criminogenic; that is, that marihuana is an independent cause of
criminal or aggressive behavior. If anything, the effects
observed suggest that marihuana may be more likely to neutralize
criminal behavior and to militate against the commission of
aggressive acts. </p>

<p>The research community has recently gathered considerable
evidence to show that marihuana and criminal, aggressive and
delinquent behavior are statistically and significantly
correlated when measured together in isolation from variables
which are related to marihuana use and other forms of antisocial
behavior. The data also show, however, that this statistical
association either attenuates significantly or disappears
completely when the proper statistical controls are applied. </p>

<p>In other words, the observed relationship between the, use of
marihuana and criminal, violent, aggressive and delinquent
behavior is spurious. It is dependent on such
extra-pharmacological factors as the age, race and education of
the user; the type of community in which he lives; his past
history of psychosocial maladjustment; and his involvement in a
criminal or delinquent subculture (use of other drugs; drug
buying and selling activities; associations with friends who also
use, buy and sell cannabis or other drugs). </p>

<p>To reiterate what Professor Goode has so cogently stated, </p>

<p><i>If there were truly a causal relationship between marihuana
use and crime, these disappearing correlations would not occur.
The application of sociological variables cannot wash out a
chemical reaction in the user</i> (1972:52). </p>

<p>To put it still another way, to believe that marihuana causes
criminal, violent, aggressive or delinquent behavior is to
confuse the effects of the drug with the people who use it. </p>

<p>From the perspective of marihuana's relationship to antisocial
behavior of a criminal or violent nature, the drug cannot be said
to constitute a significant threat to the public safety. If its
use, therefore, is to be discouraged, it must be discouraged on
grounds other than its role in the commission of criminal or
violent or delinquent acts. </p>

<p>The enormous increases in marihuana arrests over the past
several years are ample evidence that the police have taken
seriously their role of maintaining law and order with respect to
marihuana use and that they have responded to public pressure and
concern about the increase in marihuana use. Yet, in their
experience with the marihuana user they have been placed in the
unenviable position of having to enforce a law either disregarded
or discredited by large segments of the population they serve. </p>

<p>Over and over again they have seen their efforts in this
respect negated by the de jure or de facto modification, if not
nullification, of the laws against possession by prosecutors,
judges and even legislators. Their increasing frustration and
demoralization, therefore, at least with respect to the marihuana
user, is quite, understandable. </p>

<p>These other officials, however, are likewise placed in a
difficult position; for they, too, must enforce and apply the
criminal law, and they, too, must respond to public pressures and
concerns. In some instances, they have demonstrated particular
resistance to criminalizing the user and subjecting him to
criminal penalties which are deemed to be unwarranted if not
unwise. </p>

<p>In the case of marihuana, recent changes in law enforcement
practices with respect to the user have, in fact, reflected the
increased use and public tolerance of marihuana. The statutory
changes now taking place at the state and local levels are
further evidence of the trend toward greater public acceptance of
the user. In these instances, the laws and their enforcement were
altered because they no longer performed the symbolic function of
expressing society's disapproval of marihuana use.<br>

<p><b>The Report of the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug
Abuse</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and Driving</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States Department of Transportation has estimated
that in 1970, more than 111 million Americans were licensed
drivers and that there were approximately 109 million vehicles
registered and regularly traversing America's streets and
highways. The Commission-sponsored National Survey (Abelson, et
al., 1972) has revealed that approximately 21 million or 15% of
all American adults 18 years and over have tried marihuana and
that about 6.9 million adults currently use the drug. </p>

<p>At the present time, there is no reliable estimate of the
proportion of marihuana users who drive while &quot;high,&quot;
but America's tragic experience with highway accidents and
fatalities involving persons driving under the influence of
alcohol raises serious questions about the extent to which
marihuana impairs driving skills and performance and thereby
constitutes a public safety hazard on this nation's
thoroughfares. </p>

<p>In recent years, public safety experts, along with the medical
and scientific communities, have devoted increasing attention to
the effects of any mind-altering drug on driving, but there is as
yet little evidence to inform discussion. As part of its more
general concern with the impact of marihuana on public safety,
the Commission has reviewed the available research and has
concluded that the evidence which presently exists is, at best,
inconclusive. </p>

<p>In view of this finding and prior to a rather brief summary of
the knowledge we now have, the Commission feels compelled to urge
the public to consider these findings as only tentative, to adopt
an extremely cautious attitude about the effects of marihuana on
driving skill and performance, and perhaps most importantly, to
avoid driving at all while under the influence of any
mind-altering drug or intoxicant. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE </b></p>

<p>The literature on drugs and driving contains several
references to the role of drugs, including marihuana, in traffic
violations, accidents and fatalities. They differ considerably,
however, in the nature and extent to which they influence or
affect driving behavior (Waller, 1965; Chetta, 1967, Commission
on Narcotic Drugs, 1968; Third Triannual Congress on Traffic
Accidents, 1969; Waller, 1970; Klein, Davis and Blackbourne, 1971
National Institute of Mental Health, 1972). </p>

<p>The studies examine the relationship between marihuana and
driving and tend to be either statistical and enumerative with
regard to traffic accidents or experimental with respect to the
physiological and psychological effects of marihuana use deemed
to be related to driving skill and performance. All of them
suffer to one degree or another from an overabundance or dearth
of extraneous variables and have, therefore, precluded
generalization of the results and the production of conclusive,
and valid findings. </p>

<p>The difficulty in interpreting the data gathered from
statistical or enumerative studies of traffic accidents derives
primarily from the inability to isolate precise cause. There are
no tissue, urine or blood analysis methods currently and
systematically in use outside the laboratory, similar to those
available for alcohol, for determining the presence of marihuana
in the bodily fluids of drivers. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Statistical Studies</b> </p>

<p>The statistical or enumerative studies generally can be
characterized as two types. In the first type, samples of
arrested marihuana, or other drug law violators are selected and
their traffic violations or accident rates are compared with
those in the general population. In the second type, samples are
drawn initially from lists of persons known to have committed
traffic violations or been involved in traffic accidents. The
samples are then divided into persons who in some way are
identified as marihuana users and those who are not and the
incidence of traffic violations or accidents in the two groups is
then compared.5 </p>

<p>5 Dr. E. J. Woodhouse, a chemist, is now in the process of
developing a marihuana testing method. At the present time he
reports being able to detect the presence of marihuana by
analyzing urine samples (Polak, 1971). </p>

<p>Waller (1965), compared the crash rates per unit miles of
driving of known marihuana users with those of other drivers of
similar age distribution. He found that the crash risk was not
increased by the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>A similar study yielding similar results was performed in the
State of Washington (Crancer and Quiring, 1968). There were no
significant differences in the crash rates per 100 drivers
between those who did use marihuana and those who did not. The
researchers compared the driving records of persons arrested for
illegal drug use (100 narcotics users, 123 dangerous drug users
and 79 marihuana users) with those of 687,228 licensed drivers
living in the same general driving environment (King's County,
Washington). Comparisons were made of the number of accidents,
the number of violations and the type of violations accumulated
between January 1, 1961 and October 1, 1967. </p>

<p>All three drug using groups had significantly higher accident
and violation rates than did the comparison group matched for age
and sex; the accident rate for the marihuana users was 39%
higher; for the narcotics users, 29% higher; and for the
dangerous drug users, 57% higher. The violation rates were 180 %
higher, 149 % higher and 16% higher, respectively. </p>

<p>Table 9 below shows the percentage of marihuana users and
county drivers, by sex, with none and 10 or more traffic
violations and accidents between January 1, 1961 and October 1,
1967. </p>

<p>Since the majority of the users were first arrested for their
illegal drug use in 1964, the researchers compared their
violation rates before and after that time. The data show a
violation rate of 1.78 per marihuana driver prior to 1964
(January 1, 1961 to June 30, 1964) ; the rate increased to 3.44
per driver between July 1, 1964 and October 1, 1967. For the same
time periods, the county group's violation rate per driver
increased from 0.4-4 to 0.53. </p>

<p>The violation rates for both reckless and hit-and run driving
were significantly higher for the marihuana users than for the
county comparison group. </p>

<p>In short, these data suggest that marihuana users are much
more likely to have many violations and accidents and are much
less likely to have clear accident and violation records than are
a comparison group of drivers drawn from the same general
population. Them findings are difficult to interpret more
precisely, however, because Such variables as the number of miles
driven and overall driving experience were not taken into
account. </p>

</p>

<p>A survey of 12,453 Virginia high school students was conducted
during 1970 by the Virginia Highway Safety Division (Ferguson and
Howard, 1971). The objectives of the survey were to determine the
extent of drug use in the Virginia high school population and to
assess the number of traffic crashes which could be caused by
drug-impaired drivers. </p>

<p>The data, show that 2.9% of the sample reported experiencing,
either as a passenger or driver, at least one traffic crash in
which drug use &quot;could have been a causal factor.&quot; The
data also show that the students were more likely to attribute
the crashes to marihuana (54%) than to other drugs (46%). Use of
marihuana was found to be slightly more common than was the use
of other drugs among drivers involved in non-fatal collisions but
was used with equal frequency in those drivers involved in fatal
crashes (p. 31). </p>

<p>The researchers suggest as an explanation for their findings
the fact that marihuana. usage was greater among this population
(12.3%) than was the use of other drugs (7.7%). This explanation
is not completely adequate, however, in that the survey ignores
both the possible presence of alcohol along with marihuana and
other drugs, either separately or in combination. As such, it
cannot be said that marihuana causes more accidents than do other
drugs, including alcohol. </p>

<p>Klein, Davis and Blackbourne (1971) surveyed students at four
academic institutions in Florida in an effort to assess the role
of marihuana in traffic involvements. Respondents were divided
into five groups of marihuana users: (a) non-users, (b) previous
users, (c) using less than four times a month, (d) using four to
eight times per month, and (e) using more than eight times per
month. For each group information was obtained relative to the
frequency of alcohol and tobacco use; respondents' ability to
judge speed, time and reaction time; traffic involvements; and
license revocations. In addition, respondents were asked their
opinion about whether or not persons under the influence of
marihuana should be permitted to operate aircraft and various
other vehicles, including taxis and private automobiles. </p>

<p>With respect to traffic involvements, the data show that 18%
of the infrequent users and 53% of the frequent users reported
having been stopped by the police while under the influence of
marihuana. The data also show that as the frequency of use
increases, so too does the number of license revocations. </p>

<p>As Nichols (1971) has pointed out, however: </p>

<p><i>Apparently no attempt was made to compare the number of
times they were stopped while under the influence of marihuana as
opposed to the number of times they were stopped while not under
the influence. Thus, the data do not give any indication of
whether the violations were due to the effects of marihuana or
whether they were the result of poor driving habits in the first
place</i> (pp. 28-29). </p>

<p>Both experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to
assessing the effects of marihuana on driving suffer from
methodological shortcominogs and inconsistent results. The
primary deficiency in the experimental investigations lies in
their inability to hold constant the numerous external variables
which actually affect driving behavior and which, therefore,
precludes valid comparisons of actual driving performance with
that simulated in a controlled but unrealistic environment. In
the quasi-experimental studies using interviewing techniques, the
accuracy of self-reports becomes a question which must be raised
with respect to the, effects of marihuana on driving skills and
performance. </p>

<p>The data derived front these studies, however, suggest that
marihuana does interfere, at least in some users, with the
ability to judge time, speed and distance ; with reaction time;
and with the ability to control the vehicle and respond to an
emergency situation (Zinberg and Well, 1969; James, 1970- Hochman
and Brill, 1971; Klein, et al., 1971). </p>

<p>Data from a survey of 10% of the undergraduate students at
UCLA (Hochman and Brill, 1971) show that one-third of all
marihuana users drive, occasionally while &quot;high.&quot; Of
the chronic users, 42% drive frequently while high and 10% always
drive while &quot;stoned&quot; (p. 22). </p>

<p>According to the researchers, &quot;both (marihuana) users and
non-users were universally of the opinion that (marihuana)
'intoxication' affected driving, but users thought, that they
compensated by being more cautious, driving more slowly, and
concentrating on the driving,&quot; (p. 22). The researchers also
report that as usage of marihuana becomes more chronic,
&quot;fear&quot; and avoidance of driving while intoxicated
decreases and the ability to compensate for the drug's effects
increases. </p>

<p>With respect to traffic violations, the data show that 4% of
occasional and chronic marihuana users had received traffic
tickets when they were intoxicated by the drug but that none had
been discovered to be intoxicated at the time. </p>

<p>These findings corroborate those, from an earlier study
(Zinberg and Weil, 1969) in which the researchers stated that
&quot;users appear to be able to compensate 100% for the
nonspecific effects of ordinary doses of marihuana on ordinary
psychological performance&quot; (p. 39). In another report Weil
(1969) wrote that &quot;it appears that once a person becomes
accustomed to the effects of cannabis, he, can compensate fully
for the drug's influence on performance of tasks of ordinary
complexity.&quot; (p. 6). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Experimental Studies </b></p>

<p>Controlled laboratory experiments have attempted to measure
these and other effects on driving with greater specificity.
Manno and his associates (1970) found that there are significant
impairments of motor and mental performance attributable to
marihuana. </p>

<p>In an experiment conducted by Frank and his colleagues (1971),
marihuana smokers demonstrated &quot;a marked and very consistent
increase in the amount of time required to recover from glare . .
. This ranged up to four times as long with a mean peak of almost
twice as long (171%) after smoking marihuana. . . . Furthermore,
this increase in glare recovery time persisted for several
hours&quot; (p. 9) and did not seem to be dose related. </p>

<p>These researchers did not find significant differences between
marihuana users and nonusers, however, in pulse, rate, time
estimation or dilation of the pupils. </p>

<p>With respect to marihuana's effect on emotional reactions, Dr.
S. E. Miller (1959) suggested that &quot;these drugs (Including
marihuana) have similar abilities for changing normal emotional
reactions, even causing individuals to become oblivious or
indifferent to their surroundings&quot; (p. 864). Klein and his
colleagues (1971), however, urge against generalizing these
findings from the laboratory situation to the complex task of
actual driving. </p>

<p>Crancer and his coworkers (1969) conducted a study designed to
determine the effects of a &quot;normal social marihuana
high&quot; on simulated driving performance among 36 experienced
marihuana smokers and compared the effects they discovered with
those occasioned by alcohol use. </p>

<p>The researchers found that experienced marihuana users under
conditions of a &quot;normal social marihuana high&quot; (from
two cigarettes totalling 1.7 grams of THC) accumulated
significantly more speedometer errors than under control
conditions. No significant differences were found, however,
relative to accelerator, brake, signal, steering or total errors
in simulator scores. </p>

<p>Comparing the effects of alcohol (at a blood level of
0.10%-the legal limit of intoxication) and marihuana intoxication
(1.7 grams THC), the researchers concluded that moderate
intoxication by marihuana was less detrimental to simulated
driving performance than was the presence of alcohol at the 0.10%
blood level. The mean error scores were 84.46 for the control
group, 84.49 for the marihuana group and 97.44 for the alcohol
group (p. 6). </p>

<p>There have been several criticisms leveled at this study,
however, and several researchers have cited contradictory
findings. Frank and his associates (1971) have pointed out the
fact that the subjects did not have, complete control over their
simulated drive. </p>

<p>Kalant (1969) noted that &quot;it does not follow
automatically that lack of effect of a drug on the simulated task
will correlate with lack of effect on the actual task&quot; (p.
640). He also criticized the use of dissimilar doses of marihuana
and alcohol for the comparison and in this regard stated that
&quot;the finding that a heavy dose of alcohol caused more
impairment than a mild dose of marihuana is neither surprising
nor helpful in assessing the relative effects of the two drugs in
the relative doses in which they are normally used&quot; (p.
640). </p>

<p>Lastly, Kalant pointed out that Crancer and his colleagues
failed to indicate if any measures were actually taken to ensure
effective absorption of the doses by the experimental subjects.
This may be important, if the findings of dose dependent
impairments observed by Dagirmanjian and Boyd (1962) and Isbell
and his associates (1967) are valid. </p>

<p>Although Crancer and his fellow researchers did not feel that
the impairments found were related to either dosage level or
experience with the drug, this latter finding is also subject to
question in view of the earlier findings of the Mayor's Committee
on Marihuana (1944) and Weil and his colleagues (1968) that the
performance of drug-naive subject, was more impaired than was
that of experienced marihuana users. </p>

<p>In a more recent simulator study, attention was directed to
the effects of marihuana on risk acceptance (Dott, 1971). The
experimental situation involved the placement of 12 experienced
marihuana users under four conditions (non-smoking, placebo, low
dose, and high dose) in order to compare subjects' reactions to
various passing situations, some of which required an immediate
response to an emergency. </p>

<p>The data show that even though more accidents occurred under
the two marihuana conditions than under the placebo (and normal)
condition, the differences were not significant. Significant
differences were found in the number of passes completed and in
the time needed to make pass decisions. Not only did the
marihuana smokers complete fewer passes (174 in placebo
condition, 153 in low dose condition, and 133 in the high dose
condition), but they took more time to make the pass decisions
while under the influence of the drug. The researcher concluded
that &quot;marihuana appears to make the subject less willing to
accept risk, and it delays elective decision reaction time.
Effects were most noted in situations which did not have a high
attention demanding value. . . . In those situations which were
of an emergency nature and which demanded immediate attention and
response . . . . no drug effects were noted&quot; (p. 28). </p>

<p>Dott also found, in contrast to Frank and his associates
(1971) that pulse rate did seem to be affected by marihuana
intoxication. </p>

<p>Based upon a comparison with the same experiment performed
years before in relation to alcohol (Light and Kelper, 1969),
Dott stated that &quot;the effects of marihuana on driving
behavior are more subtle and less hazardous than the effects of
alcohol.&quot; </p>

<p>McGlothlin (1971) is presently conducting another simulator
study and is attempting to measure the effects of marihuana,
methadone and alcohol on simulated driving, attention,
information processing abilities and other measures related to
driving efficiency such is peripheral vision, depth perception
and glare recovery. At this time, five experiments have been
conducted and the researcher has stated that: </p>

<p><i>concentrated and divided attention for both auditory and
visual modalities are significantly impaired by smoked marihuana
containing 15 mg. THC.... In general, where impairment was found
for the marihuana treatments, it appears to be equivalent to that
resulting from a blood alcohol level of about 0.01%. Frequent
marihuana users (one or two times per week) typically showed less
impairment than those using less frequently </i>(p. 22.). </p>

<p>The inconclusive and controversial nature of the research to
date suggests that there is enough of a potential risk involved
to both the individual and the public safety to recommend
strongly against driving while intoxicated-no matter what the
intoxicant. Although marihuana does not seem to produce serious
impairments of driving skills or performance, to say that the
drug does not at all adversely affect driving behavior or that it
may not be a factor in traffic violations or accidents is to
misrepresent the current state of knowledge. As the National
Institute of Mental Health (1972) has noted, &quot;obviously,
more research is needed in elucidating the role of various drugs
on highway accidents . . .&quot; (p. 220). </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>This session is going to be about the history of the
non-medical use of drugs. Let me say that, because this is going
to be a story, that I think it will interest you quite a bit. The
topic is the history of the non-medical use of drugs and I think
you ought to know what my credentials are for talking about this
topic. As you may know, before I taught at the University of
Southern California, I taught at the University of Virginia for
fifteen years, from 1968 to 1981. In that time period, the very
first major piece that I wrote was a piece entitled, &quot;The
Forbidden Fruit and the Tree of Knowledge - The Legal History of
Marihuana in the United States&quot;. I wrote it with Professor
Richard Bonnie, still of the faculty of the University of
Virginia. It was published in the Virginia Law Review in October
of 1970 and I must say that our piece was the Virginia Law Review
in October of 1970. The piece was 450 pages long. It got a ton of
national attention because no one had ever done the legal history
of marijuana before. As a result of that, Professor Bonnie was
named the Deputy Director of the National Commission on Marihuana
and Drug Abuse and I was a consultant to that commission. </p>

<p>As a result of Richard's two year executive directorship of
the National Commission in 1971 and 1972 he and I were given
access to both the open and the closed files of what was then
called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, what had
historically been called the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and what
today is called the Drug Enforcement Agency. Based upon our
access to those files, both open and closed, we wrote a book
called &quot;The Marihuana Conviction- The Legal History of Drugs
in the United States&quot; and that book went through six
printings at the University of Virginia press before being sold
out primarily in sales to my friends at the FBI over the years.
It is based upon that work that I bring you this story. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Situation in 1900</b> </p>

<p>If you are interested in the non-medical use of drugs in this
country, the time to go back to is 1900, and in some ways the
most important thing I am going to say to you guys I will say
first. That is, that in 1900 there were far more people addicted
to drugs in this country than there are today. Depending upon
whose judgment, or whose assessment, you accept there were
between two and five percent of the entire adult population of
the United States addicted to drugs in 1900. </p>

<p>Now, there were two principal causes of this dramatic level of
drug addiction at the turn of the century. The first cause was
the use of morphine and its various derivatives in legitimate
medical operations. You know as late as 1900, particularly in
areas where medical resources were scarce it was not at all
uncommon for you to say, let's say you would have appendicitis,
you would go into the hospital, and you would get morphine as a
pain killer during the operation, you would be given morphine
further after the operation and you would come out of the
hospital with no appendix but addicted to morphine. </p>

<p>The use of morphine in battlefield operations during the Civil
War was so extensive that, by 1880, so many Union veterans were
addicted to morphine that the popular press referred to
morphinism as the &quot;soldier's disease&quot;. Now I will say,
being from Virginia as I am, that the Confederate veterans didn't
have any problems about being addicted to morphine because the
South was too poor to have any, and therefore battlefield
operations on the Confederate Army were simply done by chopping
off the relevant limb while they drank a little whiskey. But the
Northern troops heavily found themselves, as the result of
battlefield operations and the use of morphine, addicted to
morphine.<br>
</p>

<p>Now, the other fact that I think that is so interesting about
drug addiction at the turn of the century, as opposed to today is
who the addicts were, because they were the exact opposite of who
you would think most likely to be an addict today. If I were to
ask you in terms of statistical groups who is most likely to be
involved with drugs today, you would say a young person, a male,
who lives in the city and who may be a minority group member.
That is the exact opposite of who was most likely to be addicted
to drugs at the turn of the century. </p>

<p>In terms of statistical groups, who was most likely to be
addicted to drugs at the turn of the century? A rural living,
middle-aged white woman. The use of morphine in medical
operations does not explain the much higher incidence of drug
addiction among women. What does is the second cause of the high
level of addiction at the turn of the century -- the growth and
development of what we now call the &quot;patent medicine&quot;
industry. </p>

<p>I think some of you, maybe from watching Westerns on TV if
nothing else are aware that, again, as late as 1900, in areas,
particularly rural areas where medical resources were scarce, it
was typical for itinerant salesmen, not themselves doctors, to
cruise around the countryside offering potions and elixirs of all
sorts advertised in the most flamboyant kinds of terms.
&quot;Doctor Smith's Oil, Good for What Ails You&quot;, or
&quot;Doctor Smith's Oil, Good for Man or Beast.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, what the purveyors of these medicines did not tell their
purchasers, was that later, when these patent medicines were
tested, many of them proved to be up to fifty percent morphine by
volume. </p>

<p>Now, what that meant, as I have always thought, was the most
significant thing about the high morphine content in patent
medicines was it meant they tended to live up to their
advertising. Because no matter what is wrong with you, or your
beast, you are going to feel a whole lot better after a couple of
slugs of an elixir that is fifty percent morphine. So there was
this tendency to think &quot;Wow! This stuff works.&quot; Down
you could go to the general store and get more of it and it could
be sold to you directly over the counter. </p>

<p>Now, for reasons that we weren't able to full research, but
for reasons, I think, probably associated with the role of women
rural societies then patent medicines were much more appealing to
women than to men and account for the much higher incidence of
drug addiction in 1900 among women than among men. </p>

<p>If you want to see a relatively current portrayal of a woman
addicted to patent medicine you might think of Eugene O'Neil's
play &quot;A Long Day's Journey Into Night&quot;. The mother
figure there, the one that was played by Katherine Hepburn in the
movies was addicted to patent medicines. </p>

<p>In any event, the use of morphine in medical operations and
the sale of patent medicines accounted for a dramatic level of
addiction. Again, between two and five percent of the entire
adult population of the United States was addicted to drugs as
late as 1900. </p>

<p>Now if my first point is that there was a lot more addiction
in 1900 than there is today and that the people who were addicted
are quite a different group than the group we would be thinking
of today, my next point would be that if you look at drug
addiction in 1900, what's the number one way in which it is
different than drug addiction today? Answer: Almost all addiction
at the turn of the century was accidental. </p>

<p>People became involved with drugs they did not know that they
were taking, that they did not know the impact of. The first
point, then, is that there was more drug addiction than there is
now and most of it was accidental. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Pure Food and Drug Act</b> </p>

<p>Then the single law which has done the most in this country to
reduce the level of drug addiction is none of the criminal laws
we have ever passed. The single law that reduced drug addiction
the most was the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act. </p>

<p>The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 did three things: </p>

<p>1). It created the Food and Drug Administration in Washington
that must approve all foods and drugs meant for human
consumption. The very first impact of that was that the patent
medicines were not approved for human consumption once they were
tested. </p>

<p>2) The Pure Food and Drug Act said that certain drugs could
only be sold on prescription. </p>

<p>3) The Pure Food and Drug Act, (and you know, this is still
true today, go look in your medicine chest) requires that any
drug that can be potentially habit-forming say so on it's label.
&quot;Warning -- May be habit forming.&quot; </p>

<p>The labeling requirements, the prescription requirements, and
the refusal to approve the patent medicines basically put the
patent medicine business out of business and reduced that
dramatic source of accidental addiction. The Pure Food and Drug
Act of 1906, not a criminal law, did more to reduce the level of
addiction than any other single statute we have passed in all of
the times from then to now. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Harrison Act</b> </p>

<p>The very first criminal law at the Federal level in this
country to criminalize the non-medical use of drugs came in 1914.
It was called the Harrison Act and there are only three things
about the Harrison Act that we need to focus on today. </p>

<p>Number one is the date. Did you hear the date, 1914? Some of
you may have come this morning thinking that we have used the
criminal law to deal with the non-medical use of drugs since the
beginning of the Republic or something. That is not true. The
entire experiment of using the criminal sanction to deal with the
non-medical use of drugs really began in this country in 1914
with the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>The second interesting thing about the Harrison Act was the
drugs to which it applied, because it applied to almost none of
the drugs we would be concerned about today. The Harrison Act
applied to opium, morphine and its various derivatives, and the
derivatives of the coca leaf like cocaine. No mention anywhere
there of amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, hashish,
hallucinogenic drugs of any kind. The Harrison Act applied only
to opium, morphine and its various derivatives and derivatives of
the coca leaf like cocaine. </p>

<p>The third and most interesting thing for you all as judges
about the Harrison Act was its structure, because the structure
of this law was very peculiar and became the model for every
single piece of Federal legislation from 1914 right straight
through 1969. And what was that model? </p>

<p>It was called the Harrison Tax Act. You know, the drafters of
the Harrison Act said very clearly on the floor of Congress what
it was they wanted to achieve. They had two goals. They wanted to
regulate the medical use of these drugs and they wanted to
criminalize the non-medical use of these drugs. They had one
problem. Look at the date -- 1914. 1914 was probably the high
water mark of the constitutional doctrine we today call
&quot;states' rights&quot; and, therefore, it was widely thought
Congress did not have the power, number one, to regulate a
particular profession, and number two, that Congress did not have
the power to pass what was, and is still known, as a general
criminal law. That's why there were so few Federal Crimes until
very recently. </p>

<p>In the face of possible Constitutional opposition to what they
wanted to do, the people in Congress who supported the Harrison
Act came up with a novel idea. That is, they would masquerade
this whole thing as though it were a tax. To show you how it
worked, can I use some hypothetical figures to show you how this
alleged tax worked? </p>

<p>There were two taxes. The first (and again, these figures
aren't accurate but they will do to show the idea) tax was paid
by doctors. It was a dollar a year and the doctors, in exchange
for paying that one dollar tax, got a stamp from the Government
that allowed them to prescribe these drugs for their patients so
long as they followed the regulations in the statute. Do you see
that by the payment of that one dollar tax, we have the doctors
regulated? The doctors have to follow the regulations in the
statute. </p>

<p>And there was a second tax. (and again, these are hypothetical
figures but they will show you how it worked.) was a tax of a
thousand dollars of every single non-medical exchange of every
one of these drugs. Well, since nobody was going to pay a
thousand dollars in tax to exchange something which, in 1914,
even in large quantities was worth about five dollars, the second
tax wasn't a tax either, it was a criminal prohibition. Now just
to be sure you guys understand this, and I am sure you do, but
just to make sure, let's say that in 1915 somebody was found,
let's say, in possession of an ounce of cocaine out here on the
street. What would be the Federal crime? Not possession of
cocaine, or possession of a controlled substance. What was the
crime? Tax evasion. </p>

<p>And do you see what a wicked web that is going to be? As a
quick preview, where then are we going to put the law enforcement
arm for the criminalization of drugs for over forty years -- in
what department? The Treasury Department. Why, we are just out
there collecting taxes and I will show you how that works in a
minute. </p>

<p>If you understand that taxing scheme then you understand why
the national marijuana prohibition of 1937 was called the
Marihuana Tax Act. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Early State Marijuana Laws</b> </p>

<p>But before we get to that next big piece of Federal
legislation, the marihuana prohibition of 1937, I would like to
take a little detour, if I may, into an analysis of the early
state marijuana laws passed in this country from 1915 to 1937. </p>

<p>Let me pause to tell you this. When Professor Bonnie and I set
out to try to track the legal history of marijuana in this
country, we were shocked that nobody had ever done that work
before. And, secondly, the few people who had even conjectured
about it went back to the 1937 Federal Act and said &quot;Well,
there's the beginning of it.&quot; No. If you go back to 1937,
that fails to take account of the fact that, in the period from
1915 to 1937, some 27 states passed criminal laws against the use
of marijuana. What Professor Bonnie and I did was, unique to our
work, to go back to the legislative records in those states and
back to the newspapers in the state capitols at the time these
laws were passed to try to find out what motivated these 27
states to enact criminal laws against the use of marijuana. What
we found was that the 27 states divided into three groups by
explanation. </p>

<p>The first group of states to have marijuana laws in that part
of the century were Rocky Mountain and southwestern states. By
that, I mean Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana. You didn't
have to go anywhere but to the legislative records to find out
what had motivated those marijuana laws. The only thing you need
to know to understand the early marijuana laws in the southwest
and Rocky Mountain areas of this country is to know, that in the
period just after 1914, into all of those areas was a substantial
migration of Mexicans. They had come across the border in search
of better economic conditions, they worked heavily as rural
laborers, beet field workers, cotton pickers, things of that
sort. And with them, they had brought marijuana. </p>

<p>Basically, none of the white people in these states knew
anything about marijuana, and I make a distinction between white
people and Mexicans to reflect a distinction that any legislator
in one of these states at the time would have made. And all you
had to do to find out what motivated the marijuana laws in the
Rocky mountain and southwestern states was to go to the
legislative records themselves. Probably the best single
statement was the statement of a proponent of Texas first
marijuana law. He said on the floor of the Texas Senate, and I
quote, &quot;All Mexicans are crazy, and this stuff (referring to
marijuana) is what makes them crazy.&quot; Or, as the proponent
of Montana's first marijuana law said, (and imagine this on the
floor of the state legislature) and I quote, &quot;Give one of
these Mexican beet field workers a couple of puffs on a marijuana
cigarette and he thinks he is in the bullring at Barcelona.&quot;
</p>

<p>Well, there it was, you didn't have to look another foot as
you went from state to state right on the floor of the state
legislature. And so what was the genesis for the early state
marijuana laws in the Rocky Mountain and southwestern areas of
this country? It wasn't hostility to the drug, it was hostility
to the newly arrived Mexican community that used it.<br>
</p>

<p>A second group of states that had criminal laws against the
use of marijuana were in the Northeast, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, New York -- had one and then repealed it and then had one
again -- New Jersey. Well, clearly no hypothesis about Mexican
immigration will explain the genesis of those laws because, as
you know, the Northeast has never had, still doesn't really, any
substantial Mexican-American population. So we had to dig a
little deeper to find the genesis of those laws. We had to go not
only to the legislative records but to the newspapers in the
state capitols at the time these laws were passed and what we
found, in the early marijuana laws in the Northeast, we labeled
the &quot;fear of substitution.&quot; If I may, let me paraphrase
an editorial from the New York Times in 1919 so we will get
exactly the flavor of this fear of substitution. </p>

<p>The New York Times in an editorial in 1919 said, &quot;No one
here in New York uses this drug marijuana. We have only just
heard about it from down in the Southwest,&quot; and here comes
the substitution. &quot;But,&quot; said the New York Times,
&quot;we had better prohibit its use before it gets here.
Otherwise&quot; -- here's the substitution concept -- &quot;all
the heroin and hard narcotics addicts cut off from their drug by
the Harrison Act and all the alcohol drinkers cut off from their
drug by 1919 alcohol Prohibition will substitute this new and
unknown drug marijuana for the drugs they used to use.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, from state to state, on the theory that this newly
encountered drug marijuana would be substituted by the hard
narcotics addicts or by the alcohol drinkers for their previous
drug that had been prohibited, state to state this fear of
substitution carried, and that accounted for 26 of the 27 states
-- that is, either the anti-Mexican sentiment in the Southwest
and Rocky Mountain areas or fear of substitution in the
Northeast. That accounted for 26 of the 27 states, and there was
only one state left over. It was the most important state for us
because it was the first state ever to enact a criminal law
against the use of marijuana and it was the state of Utah. </p>

<p>Now, if you have been hearing this story and you have been
playing along with me, you think &quot;Oh, wait a minute,
Whitebread, Utah fits exactly with Colorado, Montana, -- it must
have been the Mexicans.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, that's what I thought at first. But we went and did a
careful study of the actual immigration pattern and found, to our
surprise, that Utah didn't have then, and doesn't have now, a
really substantial Mexican-American population. So it had to be
something else. </p>

<p>Come on folks, if it had to be something else, what do you
think it might have been? Are you thinking what I was thinking --
that it must have had something to do with the single thing which
makes Utah unique in American history -- its association with the
Mormon church.<br>
</p>

<p>With help from some people in Salt Lake City, associated with
the Mormon Church and the Mormon National Tabernacle in
Washington -- with their help and a lot of work we found out what
the genesis was of the first marihuana law in this country. Yes,
it was directly connected to the history of Utah and Mormonism
and it went like this.<br>
</p>

<p>I think that a lot of you know that, in its earliest days, the
Mormon church permitted its male members to have more than one
wife -- polygamy. Do you all know that in 1876, in a case called
Reynolds against the United States, the United States Supreme
Court said that Mormons were free to believe what they wanted,
but they were not free to practice polygamy in this country.
Well, who do you think enforced that ruling of the Supreme Court
in 1876? At the end of the line, who enforces all rulings of the
Supreme Court? Answer: the state and local police. And who were
they in Utah then? All Mormons, and so nothing happened for many
years. Those who wanted to live polygamously continued to do so. </p>

<p>In 1910, the Mormon Church in synod in Salt Lake City decreed
polygamy to be a religious mistake and it was banned as a matter
of the Mormon religion. Once that happened, there was a crackdown
on people who wanted to live in what they called &quot;the
traditional way&quot;. So, just after 1910, a fairly large number
of Mormons left the state of Utah, and indeed left the United
States altogether and moved into northwest Mexico. They wrote a
lot about what they wanted to accomplish in Mexico. They wanted
to set up communities where they were basically going to convert
the Indians, the Mexicans, and what they referred to as &quot;the
heathen&quot; in the neighborhood to Mormonism. </p>

<p>By 1914, they had had very little luck with the heathen, but
our research shows now beyond question that the heathen had a
little luck with them. What happened apparently -- now some of
you who may be members of the church, you know that there are
still substantial Mormon communities in northwest Mexico -- was
that, by and large most of the Mormons were not happy there, the
religion had not done well there, they didn't feel comfortable
there, they wanted to go back to Utah where there friends were
and after 1914 did. </p>

<p>And with them, the Indians had given them marijuana. Now once
you get somebody back in Utah with the marijuana it all becomes
very easy, doesn't it? You know that the Mormon Church has always
been opposed to the use of euphoriants of any kind. So, somebody
saw them with the marijuana, and in August of 1915 the Church,
meeting again in synod in Salt Lake City decreed the use of
marijuana contrary to the Mormon religion and then -- and this is
how things were in Utah in those days -- in October of 1915, the
state legislature met and enacted every religious prohibition as
a criminal law and we had the first criminal law in this
country's history against the use of marijuana. </p>

<p>That digression into the early state marijuana laws aside, we
will now get back on the Federal track, the year is 1937 and we
get the national marijuana prohibition -- the Marihuana Tax Act <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937</b> </p>

<p>Now, first again, does everybody see the date, 1937? You may
have thought that we have had a national marijuana prohibition
for a very long time. Frankly, we haven't. </p>

<p>The marijuana prohibition is part and parcel of that era which
is now being rejected rather generally -- the New Deal era in
Washington in the late 30s.<br>
</p>

<p>Number two, you know, don't you, that whenever Congress is
going to pass a law, they hold hearings. And you have seen these
hearings. The hearings can be extremely voluminous, they go on
and on, they have days and days of hearings. Well, may I say,
that the hearings on the national marijuana prohibition were very
brief indeed. The hearings on the national marijuana prohibition
lasted one hour, on each of two mornings and since the hearings
were so brief I can tell you almost exactly what was said to
support the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>Now, in doing this one at the FBI Academy, I didn't tell them
this story, but I am going to tell you this story. You want to
know how brief the hearings were on the national marijuana
prohibition? <br>
</p>

<p>When we asked at the Library of Congress for a copy of the
hearings, to the shock of the Library of Congress, none could be
found. We went &quot;What?&quot; It took them four months to
finally honor our request because -- are you ready for this? --
the hearings were so brief that the volume had slid down inside
the side shelf of the bookcase and was so thin it had slid right
down to the bottom inside the bookshelf. That's how brief they
were. Are you ready for this? They had to break the bookshelf
open because it had slid down inside. </p>

<p>There were three bodies of testimony at the hearings on the
national marijuana prohibition. <br>
</p>

<p>The first testimony came from Commissioner Harry Anslinger,
the newly named Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
Now, I think some of you know that in the late 20s and early 30s
in this country there were two Federal police agencies created,
the FBI and the FBN -- the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. <br>
</p>

<p>In our book, I talk at great length about how different the
history of these two organizations really are. But, the two
organizations, the FBI and the FBN had some surface similarities
and one of them was that a single individual headed each of them
for a very long time. In the case of the FBI, it was J. Edgar
Hoover, and in the case of the FBN it was Harry Anslinger, who
was the Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930
until 1962.<br>
</p>

<p>Commissioner Anslinger gave the Government testimony and I
will quote him directly. By the way, he was not working from a
text that he had written. He was working from a text that had
been written for him by a District Attorney in New Orleans, a guy
named Stanley. Reading directly from Mr. Stanley's work,
Commissioner Anslinger told the Congressmen at the hearings, and
I quote, &quot;Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in
its users insanity, criminality, and death.&quot; That was the
Government testimony to support the marijuana prohibition from
the Commissioner. </p>

<p>The next body of testimony -- remember all of this took a
total of two hours -- uh .. You understand what the idea was,
don't you? The idea was to prohibit the cultivation of hemp in
America. You all know, because there has been some initiative
here in California, that hemp has other uses than its euphoriant
use. For one, hemp has always been used to make rope. Number two,
the resins of the hemp plant are used as bases for paints and
varnishes. And, finally, the seeds of the hemp plant are widely
used in bird seed. Since these industries were going to be
affected the next body of testimony came from the industrial
spokesmen who represented these industries. </p>

<p>The first person was the rope guy. The rope guy told a
fascinating story -- it really is fascinating -- the growth of a
hemp to make rope was a principle cash crop right where I am
from, Northern Virginia and Southern Maryland at the time of the
Revolutionary War. But, said the rope guy, by about 1820 it got
cheaper to import the hemp we needed to make rope from the Far
East and so now in 1937 we don't grow any more hemp to make rope
in this country -- it isn't needed anymore. </p>

<p>If you heard that story, there are two things about it that I
found fascinating. Number one, it explains the long-standing
rumor that our forefathers had something to do with marijuana.
Yes, they did -- they grew it. Hemp was the principal crop at
Mount Vernon. It was a secondary crop at Monticello. Now, of
course, in our research we did not find any evidence that any of
our forefathers had used the hemp plant for euphoriant purposes,
but they did grow it. </p>

<p>The second part of that story that, to me is even more
interesting is -- did you see the date again - 1937? What did the
rope guy say? We can get all the hemp we need to make rope from
the Far East, we don't grow it hear anymore because we don't need
to. </p>

<p>Five years later, 1942, we are cut off from our sources of
hemp in the Far East. We need a lot of hemp to outfit our ships
for World War II, rope for the ships, and therefore, the Federal
Government, as some of you know, went into the business of
growing hemp on gigantic farms throughout the Midwest and the
South to make rope to outfit the ships for World War II. </p>

<p>So, even to this day, if you are from the Midwest you will
always meet the people who say, &quot;Gosh, hemp grows all along
the railroad tracks.&quot; Well, it does. Why? Because these huge
farms existed all during World War II. </p>

<p>But, the rope people didn't care. The paint and varnish people
said &quot;We can use something else.&quot; And, of the
industrial spokesmen, only the birdseed people balked. The
birdseed people were the ones who balked and the birdseed person
was asked, &quot;Couldn't you use some other seed?&quot; </p>

<p>These are all, by the way, direct quotes from the hearings.
The answer the birdseed guy gave was, &quot;No, Congressman, we
couldn't. We have never found another seed that makes a birds
coat so lustrous or makes them sing so much.&quot; </p>

<p>So, on the ground that the birdseed people needed it -- did
you know that the birdseed people both got and kept an exemption
from the Marihuana Tax Act right through this very day for
so-called &quot;denatured seeds&quot;? </p>

<p>In any event, there was Anslinger's testimony, there was the
industrial testimony -- there was only one body of testimony left
at these brief hearings and it was medical. There were two pieces
of medical evidence introduced with regard to the marijuana
prohibition. <br>
</p>

<p>The first came from a pharmacologist at Temple University who
claimed that he had injected the active ingredient in marihuana
into the brains of 300 dogs, and two of those dogs had died. When
asked by the Congressmen, and I quote, &quot;Doctor, did you
choose dogs for the similarity of their reactions to that of
humans?&quot; The answer of the pharmacologist was, &quot;I
wouldn't know, I am not a dog psychologist.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>Well, the active ingredient in marijuana was first synthesized
in a laboratory in Holland after World War II. So what it was
this pharmacologist injected into these dogs we will never know,
but it almost certainly was not the active ingredient in
marijuana. <br>
</p>

<p>The other piece of medical testimony came from a man named Dr.
William C. Woodward. Dr. Woodward was both a lawyer and a doctor
and he was Chief Counsel to the American Medical Association. Dr.
Woodward came to testify at the behest of the American Medical
Association saying, and I quote, &quot;The American Medical
Association knows of no evidence that marihuana is a dangerous
drug.&quot; </p>

<p>What's amazing is not whether that's true or not. What's
amazing is what the Congressmen then said to him. Immediately
upon his saying, and I quote again, &quot;The American Medical
Association knows of no evidence that marihuana is a dangerous
drug.&quot;, one of the Congressmen said, &quot;Doctor, if you
can't say something good about what we are trying to do, why
don't you go home?&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>That's an exact quote. The next Congressman said,
&quot;Doctor, if you haven't got something better to say than
that, we are sick of hearing you.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, the interesting question for us is not about the medical
evidence. The most fascinating question is: why was this legal
counsel to the most prestigious group of doctors in the United
States treated in such a high-handed way? And the answer makes a
principle thesis of my work -- and that is -- you've seen it,
you've been living it the last ten years. The history of drugs in
this country perfectly mirrors the history of this country. </p>

<p>So look at the date -- 1937 -- what's going on in this
country? Well, a lot of things, but the number one thing was
that, in 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt was reelected in the
largest landslide election in this country's history till then.
He brought with him two Democrats for every Republican, all, or
almost all of them pledged to that package of economic and social
reform legislation we today call the New Deal. </p>

<p>And, did you know that the American Medical Association, from
1932, straight through 1937, had systematically opposed every
single piece of New Deal legislation. So that, by 1937, this
committee, heavily made up of New Deal Democrats is simply sick
of hearing them: &quot;Doctor, if you can't say something good
about what we are trying to do, why don't you go home?&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>So, over the objection of the American Medical Association,
the bill passed out of committee and on to the floor of Congress.
Now, some of you may think that the debate on the floor of
Congress was more extensive on the marijuana prohibition. It
wasn't. It lasted one minute and thirty-two seconds by my count
and, as such, I will give it to you verbatim.<br>
</p>

<p>The entire debate on the national marijuana prohibition was as
follows -- and, by the way, if you had grown up in Washington, DC
as I had you would appreciate this date. Are you ready? The bill
was brought on to the floor of the House of Representatives --
there never was any Senate debate on it not one word -- 5:45
Friday afternoon, August 20. Now, in pre-air-conditioning
Washington, who was on the floor of the House? Who was on the
floor of the House? Not very many people. </p>

<p>Speaker Sam Rayburn called for the bill to be passed on
&quot;tellers&quot;. Does everyone know &quot;tellers&quot;? Did
you know that for the vast bulk of legislation in this country,
there is not a recorded vote. It is simply, more people walk past
this point than walk past that point and it passes -- it's called
&quot;tellers&quot;. They were getting ready to pass this thing
on tellers without discussion and without a recorded vote when
one of the few Republicans left in Congress, a guy from upstate
New York, stood up and asked two questions, which constituted the
entire debate on the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Speaker, what is this bill about?&quot; </p>

<p>To which Speaker Rayburn replied, &quot;I don't know. It has
something to do with a thing called marihuana. I think it's a
narcotic of some kind.&quot; </p>

<p>Undaunted, the guy from Upstate New York asked a second
question, which was as important to the Republicans as it was
unimportant to the Democrats. &quot;Mr. Speaker, does the
American Medical Association support this bill?&quot; </p>

<p>In one of the most remarkable things I have ever found in any
research, a guy who was on the committee, and who later went on
to become a Supreme Court Justice, stood up and -- do you
remember? The AMA guy was named William C. Woodward -- a member
of the committee who had supported the bill leaped to his feet
and he said, &quot;Their Doctor Wentworth came down here. They
support this bill 100 percent.&quot; It wasn't true, but it was
good enough for the Republicans. They sat down and the bill
passed on tellers, without a recorded vote. </p>

<p>In the Senate there never was any debate or a recorded vote,
and the bill went to President Roosevelt's desk and he signed it
and we had the national marijuana prohibition. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1938 to 1951</b> </p>

<p>Now, the next step in our story is the period from 1938 to
1951. I have three stories to tell you about 1938 to 1951. </p>

<p>The first of them. Immediately after the passage of the
national marijuana prohibition, Commissioner Anslinger decided to
hold a conference of all the people who knew something about
marijuana -- a big national conference. He invited forty-two
people to this conference. As part our research for the book, we
found the exact transcript of this conference. Ready? </p>

<p>The first morning of the conference of the forty-two people
that Commissioner Anslinger invited to talk about marijuana, 39
of them got up and said some version of &quot;Gee, Commissioner
Anslinger, I don't know why you asked me to this conference, I
don't know anything about marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>That left three people. Dr. Woodward and his assistant -- you
know what they thought. </p>

<p>That left one person -- the pharmacologist from Temple
University -- the guy with the dogs. </p>

<p>And what do you think happened as a result of that conference?
Commissioner Anslinger named the pharmacologist from Temple
University the Official Expert of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
about marijuana, a position the guy held until 1962. Now, the
irony of trying to find out what the drug did after it had been
prohibited -- finding out that only one person agrees with you --
and naming him the Official Expert, speaks for itself. </p>

<p>The next story from this time period was a particular favorite
of the police groups to whom I spoke at the FBI Academy, because
it is a law enforcement story. </p>

<p>After national marijuana prohibition was passed, Commissioner
Anslinger found out, or got reports, that certain people were
violating the national marijuana prohibition and using marijuana
and, unfortunately for them, they fell into an identifiable
occupational group. Who were flouting the marijuana prohibition?
Jazz musicians. And so, in 1947, Commissioner Anslinger sent out
a letter, I quote it verbatim, &quot;Dear Agent So-and-so, Please
prepare all cases in your jurisdiction involving musicians in
violation of the marijuana laws. We will have a great national
round-up arrest of all such persons on a single day. I will let
you know what day.&quot; </p>

<p>That letter went out on, I think, October 24, 1947. The
responses by the resident agents were all in the file. My
favorite -- at the bottom line, there wasn't a single resident
agent who didn't have reservations about this idea -- came from
the Hollywood agent. This is the exact letter of the FBN agent in
charge in Hollywood. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Commissioner Anslinger, </p>

<p>I have your letter of October 24. Please be advised that the
musical community here in Hollywood are unionized and very tight
we have been unable to get an informant inside it. So, at the
present time, we have no cases involving musicians in violation
of the marihuana laws.&quot; </p>

<p>For the next year and a half, Commissioner Anslinger got those
kinds of letters. He never acknowledged any of the problems that
the agents said they were having with this idea and always wrote
them back the same letter. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Agent so-and-so, </p>

<p>Glad to hear you are working hard to give effect to my
directive of October 24, 1947. We will (and he always underlined
the word 'will') have a great national round-up arrest of
musicians in violation of the marijuana laws all on a single day.
Don't worry, I will let you know what day.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>This went on -- and, of course, you know that some jazz
musicians were, in fact, arrested in the late 40's -- this all
went on until it ended just the way it began -- with something
that Anslinger said. I don't see anybody in here really old
enough to appreciate this point, but Commissioner Anslinger was
testifying before a Senate Committee in 1948. He was saying,
&quot;I need more agents.&quot; And, of course, the Senators
asked him why. </p>

<p>&quot;Because there are people out there violating the
marijuana laws.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, you know what the Senators asked -- &quot;Who?&quot; </p>

<p>And in a moment that every Government employee should avoid
like the plague, Anslinger first said, &quot;Musicians.&quot; But
then he looked up at that Senate committee and he gave them a
little piece of his heart and said the single line which provoked
the most response in this country's history about the non-medical
use of drugs. Anslinger said, &quot;And I don't mean good
musicians, I mean jazz musicians.&quot; </p>

<p>Friends, there is no way to tell you what a torrent ensued.
Within 24 hours, 76 newspaper editorials slammed him, including
special editions the then booming trade press of the jazz music
industry. With three days, the Department of the Treasury had
received fifteen thousand letters. bunches of them were still in
bags when I got there -- never been opened at all. I opened a
few. Here was a typical one, and it was darling. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Commissioner Anslinger, </p>

<p>I applaud your efforts to rid America of the scourge of
narcotics addiction. If you are as ill-informed about that as you
are about music, however, you will never succeed.&quot; </p>

<p>One of the things that we had access to that really was fun
was the Commissioner's own appointment book for all of his years.
And, five days after he says &quot;I don't mean good musicians, I
mean jazz musicians.&quot; there is a notation: 10 AM --
appointment with the Secretary of the Treasury.&quot; Well, I
don't know what happened at that appointment, but from that
appointment on, no mention is ever made again of the great
national round-up arrest of musicians in violation of the
marijuana laws all on a single day, much to the delight of the
agents who never had any heart for it in the first place.<br>
</p>

<p>The final story from this period is my favorite story from
this period, by far, and, again, there is simply nobody here who
is really old enough to appreciate this story. You know, if you
talk to your parents -- that's the generation we really need to
talk to -- people who were adults during the late 30's and 40's.
And you talk to them about marijuana in particular you would be
amazed at the amazing reputation that marijuana has among the
generation ahead of you as to what it does to its users. </p>

<p>In the late 30's and early 40's marihuana was routinely
referred to as &quot;the killer drug&quot;, &quot;the assassin of
youth&quot;. You all know &quot;reefer madness&quot;, right?
Where did these extraordinary stories that circulated in this
country about what marijuana would do to its users come from? </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom is that Anslinger put them over on
Americans in his effort to compete with Hoover for
empire-building, etc. I have to say, in some fairness, that one
of the things that our research did, in some sense, was to
rehabilitate Commissioner Anslinger. Yes, there was some of that
but, basically, it wasn't just that Anslinger was trying to dupe
people. </p>

<p>The terrific reputation that marijuana got in the late 30s and
early 40s stemmed from something Anslinger had said. Does
everybody remember what Anslinger said about the drug?
&quot;Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users
insanity, criminality, and death.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, this time the magic word -- come along lawyers out
there, where's the magic word? -- Insanity. Marihuana use, said
the Government, would produce insanity. </p>

<p>And, sure enough, in the late 30s and early 40s, in five
really flamboyant murder trials, the defendant's sole defense was
that he -- or, in the most famous of them, she -- was not guilty
by reason of insanity for having used marijuana prior to the
commission of the crime. </p>

<p>All right, it's time to take you guys back to class here. If
you are going to put on an insanity defense, what do you need?
You need two things, don't you? Number one, you need an Expert
Witness. </p>

<p>Where, oh where, in this story, are we going to find an expert
witness? Here it comes -- sure enough -- the guy from Temple
University -- the guy with the dogs. I promise you, you are not
going to believe this. </p>

<p>In the most famous of these trials, what happened was two
women jumped on a Newark, New Jersey bus and shot and killed and
robbed the bus driver. They put on the marijuana insanity
defense. The defense called the pharmacologist, and of course,
you know how to do this now, you put the expert on, you say
&quot;Doctor, did you do all of this experimentation and so
on?&quot; You qualify your expert. &quot;Did you write all about
it?&quot; &quot;Yes, and I did the dogs&quot; and now he is an
expert. Now you ask him what? You ask the doctor &quot;What have
you done with the drug?&quot; And he said, and I quote,
&quot;I've experimented with the dogs, I have written something
about it and&quot; -- are you ready -- &quot;I have used the drug
myself.&quot; </p>

<p>What do you ask him next? &quot;Doctor, when you used the
drug, what happened?&quot; </p>

<p>With all the press present at this flamboyant murder trial in
Newark New Jersey, in 1938, the pharmacologist said, and I quote,
in response to the question &quot;When you used the drug, what
happened?&quot;, his exact response was: &quot;After two puffs on
a marijuana cigarette, I was turned into a bat.&quot; </p>

<p>He wasn't done yet. He testified that he flew around the room
for fifteen minutes and then found himself at the bottom of a
two-hundred-foot high ink well </p>

<p>Well, friends, that sells a lot of papers. What do you think
the Newark Star Ledger headlines the next day, October 12, 1938?
&quot;Killer Drug Turns Doctor to Bat!&quot; </p>

<p>What else do we need to put on an insanity defense? We need
the defendant's testimony -- himself or herself. OK, you put
defendant on the stand, what do you ask? &quot;What happened on
the night of . .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I used marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And then what happened?&quot; </p>

<p>And, if the defendant wants to get off, what is he or she
going to say? &quot;It made me crazy.&quot; </p>

<p>You know what the women testified? In Newark they testified,
and I quote, &quot;After two puffs on a marijuana cigarette my
incisor teeth grew six inches long and dripped with blood.&quot; </p>

<p>This was the craziest business you ever saw. Every one of
these so-called marijuana insanity defenses were successful. </p>

<p>The one in New York was just outlandish. Two police officers
were shot and killed in cold blood. The defendant puts on the
marijuana insanity defense and, in that case, there was never
even any testimony that the defendant had even used marijuana.
The testimony in the New York case was that, from the time the
bag of marijuana came into his room it gave off &quot;homicidal
vibrations&quot;, so he started killing dogs, cats, and
ultimately two police officers. </p>

<p>Commissioner Anslinger, sitting in Washington, seeing these
marijuana insanity defenses, one after another successful, he
writes to the pharmacologist from Temple University and says,
&quot;If you don't stop testifying for the defense in these
matters, we are going to revoke your status as the Official
Expert of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.&quot; He didn't want
to lose his status, so he stopped testifying, nobody else would
testify that marijuana had turned them into a bat, and so these
insanity defenses were over but not before marijuana had gotten
quite a reputation, indeed. </p>

<p>The next step -- and now we are going to move very quickly
here -- in 1951. We get a whole new drug law called the Boggs Act
and it is important to us for only two reasons. </p>

<p>Number one, it reflects what I am going to call the formula
for drug legislation in this country. Here is the formula. The
formula really is always the same, think about it in our
lifetime. </p>

<p>The formula is that someone, and by the way, that someone is
usually the media, perceive an increase in drug use. What's the
answer? The answer in the history of this country is always the
same -- a new criminal law with harsher penalties in every single
offense category. </p>

<p>Where did the perception come from this time? Well, if you
have ever seen movies from this time period like High School
Confidential, the perception was that kids in high school were
starting to use drugs. What's the answer? The answer is always
the same. The Boggs Act of 1951 quadrupled the penalties in every
single offense category and, by the way, the Boggs Act had a
whole new rationale for the marijuana prohibition. </p>

<p>Do you remember the old rationale -- that marijuana was an
addictive drug which caused in its users insanity, criminality,
and death? Just before Anslinger was to testify on the Boggs Act,
the doctor who ran for the Government the Lexington, Kentucky
narcotics rehabilitation clinic testified ahead of Anslinger and
testified that the medical community knew that marijuana wasn't
an addictive drug,. It doesn't produce death, or insanity, and
instead of producing criminality, it probably produces passivity,
said the doctor. </p>

<p>Who was the next witness? Anslinger. And, if you see, that the
rug had been pulled out from under everything he had said in the
1937 hearings to support the marijuana prohibition. In what I
call a really slick Federal shuffle -- Anslinger, you know, had
been bitten bad enough by what he said, he didn't want that again
-- he said, the doctor is right, marijuana -- he always believed,
by the way, that there was something in marijuana which produced
criminality -- is not an addictive drug, it doesn't produce
insanity or death but it is &quot;the certain first step on the
road to heroin addiction.&quot; And the notion that marijuana was
the stepping stone to heroin became, in 1951, the sole rationale
for the national marijuana prohibition. It was the first time
that marijuana was lumped with all the other drugs and not
treated separately, and we multiply the penalties in every
offense category. </p>

<p>By the way, I told you that the history of drug legislation
reflects the history of the country. 1951, what's going on? The
Korean War, the Cold War. It didn't take the press a minute to
see this perceived use in drug use among high school kids as our
&quot;foreign enemies&quot;, using drugs to subvert the American
young. In our book, we have ten or fifteen great political
cartoons. My favorite is a guy with a big Fu Man Chu (mustache)
labeled &quot;Oriental Communism.&quot; He has a big needle
marked &quot;Dope&quot; and he has the American kids lying down
-- &quot;Free World&quot; it is marked. There it was -- that our
foreign enemies were going to use drugs to subvert the American
young. What did we do? We passed a new law that increased the
penalties in every offense category by a factor of four. </p>

<p>Well, now once you buy it, the ball is going to roll like
crazy. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1956 and the Daniel Act</b> </p>

<p>1956, we get another new drug law, called the Daniel Act,
named for Senator Price Daniel of Texas. It is important to us
for only two reasons. One, it perfectly reflects the formula
again. What is the formula? Somebody perceives an increase in
drug use in this country and the answer is always a new criminal
law with harsher penalties in every offense category. </p>

<p>Where did the perception in 1956 come from that there was an
increase in drug use? Answer: Anybody remember 1956? In 1956, we
had the first set ever of televised Senate hearings. And whose
hearings were they? They were the hearings of Senator Estes
Kefauver of Tennessee about organized crime in America. </p>

<p>These hearings, which everybody watched on their little sets
showed two things that we all know today, but it sure made their
socks roll up and down then. Number one, there is organized crime
in America and number two, it makes all its money selling drugs.
There it was, that was all the perception we needed. We passed
the Daniel Act which increased the penalties in every offense
category, that had just been increased times four -- times eight.
</p>

<p>With the passage of each of these acts, the states passed
little Boggs acts, and little Daniel acts, so that in the period
1958 to 1969, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Virginia was
typical, the most heavily penalized crime in the Commonwealth was
possession of marijuana, or any other drug. </p>

<p>It led to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years, no
part of which you were eligible for parole or probation, and as
to no part of it were you eligible for a suspended sentence. </p>

<p>Just to show you where it was, in the same time period first
degree murder in Virginia had a mandatory minimum sentence of
fifteen years. Rape, a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years.
Possession of marijuana -- not to mention sales of marijuana with
its mandatory minimum of forty years -- mandatory minimum of
twenty years. </p>

<p>That is the situation in 1969 when we have a new drug law, the
first one in this country's history that does not follow the
formula. It is the 1969 Dangerous Substances Act. For he first
time in this country's history, we have a perception of an
increase in drug use during the Sixties, but instead of raising
the penalties, we lower them. And, further, in the Dangerous
Substances Act of 1969, for the first time we finally abandon the
so-called &quot;taxing&quot; mythology. </p>

<p>In the 1969 Act, what the Federal law does is, it takes all
the drugs we know -- if you can't fill in this next blank, you
are in trouble -- except two -- which two? Which two are never
going to be mentioned? Nicotine and alcohol. But, other than
nicotine and alcohol -- every other drug. </p>

<p>By the way, I tried this with the FBI for twenty years and
they wouldn't listen, and you won't listen either but, I am going
to try. If you are going to go out and talk about drugs and
whatever you are going to do with drugs, will you please discard
the entirely antiquated and erroneous word &quot;narcotics.&quot;
Narcotics are drugs that put people to sleep. Almost all of the
drugs that we are interested in today don't do that. </p>

<p>So, in 1969, the Dangerous Substances Act gave up the effort
to define what are narcotic drugs. What the 1969 act did, and
what most state laws still do, is to classify all drugs except
nicotine and alcohol by two criteria. What is the drug's medical
use? And, what is the drug's potential for abuse? </p>

<p>We put all the drugs, by those two criteria, in schedules, and
then we tie the penalties for possession, possession with intent
to sell, sale, and sale to a minor to the schedule of the drug in
question. Now, again, I am no good at this anymore, I have not
kept up with the drug laws, I don't know who is in what schedule,
and many states have abandoned the schedule but, to give you a
flavor of it: The first schedule, Schedule One Drugs were drugs
that had little or no medical use and a high potential for abuse.
What's going to go in there? LSD, marijuana, hashish, they are
all in Schedule One -- little or no medical use and a high
potential for abuse. </p>

<p>Then you get some medical use, high potential for abuse --
what do you want there? Barbiturates, amphetamines,. </p>

<p>Then we are going to get what? High medical use and high
potential for abuse. Morphine, codeine. Codeine is the best one
because codeine is in almost every single prescription cough
medicine and it is addictive as can be. </p>

<p>Then you go on down and get the antibiotics -- high medical
use, almost no potential for abuse, and there you are. </p>

<p>Once you schedule your drugs, you then tie the penalties for
the drugs to the schedule and then, because in 1969 they wanted
to reduce the marijuana penalties they had to deal with marijuana
separately and did so. </p>

<p>But the 1969 act important for two reasons again: One, we
abandoned the taxing mythology and; two, it was the first law in
this country's history that, instead of raising the penalties in
every offense category, lowered them. </p>

<p>Well, then you know what happened. We get the War on Drugs.
You know how it all went down. We got perceptions in the 80s that
there was an increase in drug use, a great dramatic decision to
declare war on drugs and, predominantly, war on drug users. </p>

<p>What I want to say to you is this, and this is where I think
some of you are going to be a little surprised. You know as much
about that process as I do. You watched it. You saw how we had
one law after another, raising the penalties so that as late as
1990, thirty percent of the minority group population of the City
of Baltimore who are male and between 20 and 29 are under court
supervision for drugs. Thirty percent, that's the number you are
looking for. </p>

<p>The War on Drugs, a very interesting war, because why? It was
cheap to fight. It was cheap to fight at first -- why? You heard
me in the &quot;Recent Decisions&quot; talk. What was last year's
big moment, and the year before? The change in cheap and easy
forfeiture. Criminal forfeiture was used to make this a costless
war. That is, easy forfeiture from those who were caught allowed
us to pay for the war in that way. I think we are going to have
some real questions about whether people want to pay for the war
on drugs through their taxes because now the Court has made
forfeiture much, much more difficult in their overall concern for
property rights. </p>

<p>But here is what I think may surprise some of you. You guys
know as much about the War on Drugs as I do. I didn't come hear
to talk, or to harangue, or to give you any opinions on that
point. I think it speaks for itself. It is a failure and I think
it will be judged as a failure. What I wanted to bring you
instead was, instead of talking about that that everybody is
talking about -- and you guys will ultimately resolve it and you
guys are the ones who are seeing all the drug cases, day in and
day out, and always will, until this changes. But, what I thought
I could bring you was the part of the story you hadn't heard --
how we got to where we were when the War on Drugs was declared.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Conclusion - The Issue of Prohibition </b></p>

<p>And one other thing I want to do with you this morning, and
that's this -- I want to say one thing. To tell you the real
truth, my interest isn't in drugs, or in the criminalization of
drugs although I think we should abolish the criminal penalties
for drugs, and deal with it as the Europeans do in a medical way,
but who cares? That's an opinion.<br>
</p>

<p>What interests me though, isn't drugs. What interests me is
that larger issue, and the reason that I wrote the piece, and the
reason they were my tenure pieces, I am interested in a much
larger issue, and that is the idea of Prohibition -- the use of
criminal law to criminalize conduct that a large number of us
seem to want to engage in. <br>
</p>

<p>And, for my purposes, -- now, Professor Bonnie went on to be
associated with NIDA and with all kinds of drug-related
organizations and continues to be interested in the drug laws --
I am not. My interest is in criminal prohibitions and, for my
purposes, as a criminal law scholar, we could have used any
prohibition -- alcohol prohibition, the prohibition against
gambling that exists still in many states. How about the
prohibition in England from 1840 to 1880 against the drinking of
gin? Not drinking, just gin -- got it? We could have used any of
these prohibitions. We didn't. We chose the marijuana prohibition
because the story had never been told -- and it is an amazing
story.<br>
</p>

<p>We could have used any of these prohibitions. We could have
used the alcohol prohibition. The reason we didn't is because so
much good stuff has been written about it. And are you aware of
this? That every single -- you know how fashionable it is to
think that scholars can never agree? -- Don't you believe that --
Every single person who has ever written seriously about the
national alcohol prohibition agrees on why it collapsed. Why? </p>

<p>Because it violated that iron law of Prohibitions. What is the
iron law of Prohibitions? Prohibitions are always enacted by US,
to govern the conduct of THEM. Do you have me? Take the alcohol
prohibition. Every single person who has ever written about it
agrees on why it collapsed. </p>

<p>Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking. Do you have me? What?
The right answer to that one is Huh? Want to hear it again? </p>

<p>Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking. Want to see it? </p>

<p>Let me give you an example, 1919. You are a Republican in
upstate New York. Whether you drink, or you don't, you are for
the alcohol prohibition because it will close the licensed
saloons in the City of New York which you view to be the corrupt
patronage and power base of the Democratic Party in New York. So
almost every Republican in New York was in favor of national
alcohol prohibition. And, as soon as it passed, what do you think
they said? &quot;Well, what do you know? Success. Let's have a
drink.&quot; That's what they thought, &quot;let's have a
drink.&quot; &quot;Let's drink to this.&quot; A great success,
you see. </p>

<p>Do you understand me? Huge numbers of people in this country
were in favor of national alcohol prohibition who were not
themselves opposed to drinking. </p>

<p>I just want to go back to the prohibition against the drinking
of gin. How could a country prohibit just the drinking of gin,
not the drinking of anything else for forty years? Answer: The
rich people drank whiskey and the poor people drank what? -- gin.
Do you see it? </p>

<p>Let's try the gambling prohibition. You know when I came to
Virginia, this was a very lively issue, the gambling prohibition.
By the way, I think it's a lively issue in California. Are you
ready for it?<br>
</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the rhetoric that goes around the gambling
prohibition? You know what it is. Look, we have had a good time.
We have been together yesterday, we have been together today, I
have known a lot of you guys for ages. How about after the talk,
we have a minute or two, let's go on up to your room and we will
play a little nickel, dime, quarter poker. Want to play some
poker this afternoon? Why not? It's a nice thing to do.<br>
</p>

<p>Would we be outraged if the California State Police came
barreling through the door and arrested us for violation of
California's prohibition on gambling? Of course we would.
Because, who is not supposed to gamble? Oh, you know who is not
supposed to gamble -- them poor people, that's who. My God, they
will spend the milk money. They don't know how to control it.
They can't handle it. But us? We know what we are doing.<br>
</p>

<p>That's it. Every criminal prohibition has that same touch to
it, doesn't it? It is enacted by US and it always regulates the
conduct of THEM. And so, if you understand that is the name of
the game, you don't have to ask me, or any of the other people
which prohibitions will be abolished and which ones won't because
you will always know. The iron law of prohibitions -- all of them
-- is that they are passed by an identifiable US to control the
conduct of an identifiable THEM. <br>
</p>

<p>And a prohibition is absolutely done for when it does what?
Comes back and bothers US. If, at any time, in any way, that
prohibition comes back and bothers us, we will get rid of it for
sure, every doggone time. Look at the alcohol prohibition if you
want a quick example. As long as it is only THEM --- you know,
them criminals, them crazy people, them young people, them
minority group members --- we are fine. But any prohibition that
comes back and bothers US is done for.<br>
</p>

<p>Let's just try the marijuana prohibition as a quick one. Who
do you think was arrested 650,000 strong two years ago for
violation of the marijuana laws? Do you think it was all minority
group members? Nope. It was not. It was some very identifiable
children of US -- children of the middle class. You don't have to
answer my opinion. No prohibition will stand -- ever-- when it
comes back and penalizes our children -- the children of US who
enacted it. And in fact, do you have any real doubt about that?
Do you know what a fabulous sociological study we will be if we
become the first society in the history of the world to penalize
the sons and daughters of the wealthy class? Unheard of. </p>

<p>And so, yeah, we will continue the War on Drugs for a while
until everybody sees its patent bankruptcy. But, let me say that
I am not confident that good sense will prevail. Why? Because we
love this idea of prohibition. We really do. We love it in this
country. And so I will tell you what I predict. You will always
know which ones are going out and which ones are coming in. And,
can't you see the one coming right over the hill? Well, folks, we
are going to have a new prohibition because we love this idea
that we can solve difficult medical, economic, and social
problems by the simple enactment of a criminal law. We adore
this, and of course, you judges work it out, we have solved our
problem. Do you have it? Our problem is over with the enactment
of the law. You and the cops work it out, but we have solved our
problem. </p>

<p>Here comes the new one? What's it going to be? No, it won't be
guns, this one starts easy. This one is the Surgeon General has
what? --Determined -- not &quot;we want a little more checking it
out&quot;, not &quot;we need a few more studies&quot;, not
&quot;reasonable people disagree&quot; -- &quot;The Surgeon
General has determined that the smoking of cigarettes will kill
you.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, all you need, and here is my formula, for a new
prohibition every time is what? We need an intractable,
difficult, social, economic, or medical problem. But that is not
enough. There has to be another thing. It has to divide by class
--- by social or economic class, between US and THEM. </p>

<p>And so, here it comes. ' </p>

<p>You know the Federal Government has been spending a lot of
money since 1968 trying to persuade us not to smoke. And, indeed,
the absolute numbers on smoking have declined very little. But,
you know who has quit smoking, don't you? In gigantic numbers?
The college-educated, that's who. The college-educated, that's
who doesn't smoke. Who are they? Tomorrow's what? Movers and
kickers, that's who. Tomorrow's movers and kickers don't smoke.
Who does smoke? Oh, you know who smokes out of all proportion to
their numbers in the society -- it is the people standing in your
criminal courtrooms, that's who. Who are they? Tomorrow's moved
and kicked, that's who. </p>

<p>And, there it is friends, once it divides between the movers
and kickers and the moved and kicked it is all over and it will
be all over very shortly. </p>

<p>It starts with &quot;You know, they shouldn't smoke, they are
killing themselves.&quot; Then it turns, as it has -- you see the
ads out here -- &quot;They shouldn't smoke, they are killing
us.&quot; And pretty soon, that class division will happen, we
will have the legislatures full of tomorrow's movers and kickers
and they are going to say just what they are going to say any
time now. &quot;You know, this has just gotta stop, and we got an
answer for it.&quot; We are going to have a criminal statute that
forbids the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco
cigarettes, or tobacco products period. </p>

<p>You know that the cigarette companies are expecting it. What
have they been doing? They have been shifting all of their
operations out of the United States and diversifying like crazy.
Where are they going to sell their cigarettes? In China, that's
where. And they are already moving, because they see it and I see
it. </p>

<p>Ready? What are we going to have? You know what we are going
to have. One day -- when's it gonna happen, ten years, fifteen?
-- some legislator will get up and, just as though it had never
been said before, &quot;You know we gotta solve this smoking
problem and I got a solution -- a criminal prohibition against
the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco cigarettes.&quot;
And then you know what happens. Then everybody who did want a
cigarette here today, if there is anyone here who smokes, you are
going to have to hide in the bathroom. And cigarettes are no
longer going to be three dollars a pack, they are going to be
three dollars a piece. And who's going to sell them to you? Who
will always sell them to you? The people who will sell you
anything -- organized crime. You got the concept, we will go
through the whole darn thing again because I am telling you this
country is hooked on the notion of prohibition. </p>

<p>Let me conclude, and again this is my prediction -- I will
tell you I don't think it is subject to opinion. Just look at it.
Just take a look at what has happened now and what will happen. I
will tell you how inexorable it is. If we get together here in
the year 2005, I will bet you that it is as likely as not that
the possession of marijuana may not be criminal in this state.
But the manufacture, sale, and possession of tobacco will be, and
why? Because we love this idea of prohibitions, we can't live
without them. They are our very favorite thing because we know
how to solve difficult, social, economic, and medical problems --
a new criminal law with harsher penalties in every category for
everybody.<br>

<p><b>THE HISTORY OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM, COCAINE, AND
THEIR DERIVATIVES</b> </p>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p>Legislative control over dangerous drugs may be dated from
attempts in the nineteenth century to prevent acute poisoning by
certain substances that might be purchased in ignorance of their
lethal potential or might be too easily available to would-be
suicides. Opium was being sold in a crude form containing about
10 percent morphine, as well as in concoctions derived from crude
opium: paregoric, laudanum, and a solution in acetic acid known
as &quot;black drop.&quot; Morphine had been isolated from opium
in 1805 by the German pharmacist, F. W. Serturner, but production
of the powerful active ingredient of opium on a large scale was
delayed until the 1830s.1 From that time onward, in factories in
Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, morphine was
produced in great quantities. Thus when in 1868, Great Britain
came to enact pharmacy laws to control dangerous substances,
&quot;opium and all preparations of opium or of poppies&quot; was
listed alongside such substances as oxalic acid as commodities
that could not be sold without being labeled &quot;poison.&quot;'
</p>

<p>The Pharmacy Act of 1868 is an important symbol of legislative
control in a Western country. The act was not the most strict
among nations; perhaps the Prussian regulations were stricter and
more comprehensive, but establishment by the British of some
limitation on the availability of dangerous drugs-drugs that
would eventually become more serious a problem for society as
addictive agents than as tools for suicide-was a policy also
followed by other European nations. It had an apparently
discouraging effect on the per capita consumption of opium,
opiates, and cocaine in the late nineteenth century and
contributed to the low level of British consumption (at least
compared to the American) right up to the 1960s.3 </p>

<p>The experience of the United States stands in contrast to
Britain's. The Pharmacy Act of 1868 was regulated in large part
by the organized association of pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical
Society (established 1841). In order to retail, dispense, or
compound &quot;poisons,&quot; or to assume the title of chemist,
druggist, pharmacist, or dispensing druggist or chemist, the
individual had to be registered by the Pharmaceutical Society. As
well as being the testing and registering body, the Society was
also given the initial responsibility for adding new drugs to the
poison list. Thus the law, which ultimately would be enforced in
British courts, was monitored by local members of the
Pharmaceutical Society as a tool in competition with unregistered
druggists, grocers, and anyone else who might attempt to purvey
these drugs to the public. </p>

<p>While the act presumably aided the public health by having
dangerous drugs sold or dispensed by individuals knowledgeable
about their qualities, it was also a convenient aid to the trade
of registered pharmacists. Although the drugs could be obtained
with no specific restraint on the amount or frequency of sale,
the bottles had to be labeled &quot;poison.&quot; A stricter
category of substances also required that the purchaser be an
acquaintance of the pharmacist or someone the pharmacist knew.
This list included arsenic and &quot;strychnine and all poisonous
alkaloids and their salts.&quot; The impact of this modest
obstacle to the acquirement of dangerous drugs should not be
underestimated. Further, the self-interest that would motivate
registered pharmacists to monitor breaches of the law provided an
unpaid, but interested, drug enforcement cadre scattered
throughout Great Britain. &quot;Patent medicines&quot; were
excepted from these controls, and this led to a campaign against
them later in the century, but the pure forms of the drugs, e.g.,
morphine suitable for injection, were restricted in availability
from the time of the Pharmacy Act onward.' In the United States,
throughout the nineteenth century, both medicine and pharmacy
remained essentially unorganized, although there were some
physicians and pharmacists attempting to organize their
professions. The American Medical Association, which was founded
in 1847 and which we now might think of as the dominant medical
organization, was a small and nationally unrepresentative group
until about World War 1.5 The American Pharmaceutical
Association, founded four years later, grew slowly and, like the
AMA, lacked the authority to license practitioners. The pharmacy
establishment was divided sharply among drug manufacturers,
wholesalers, and retailers, whose divergent interests the APhA
tried to coordinate, but each segment of the profession came to
work through its own organization: the National Wholesale
Druggists' Association (1882), the National Association of Retail
Druggists (1898), and many other groups.6 There was no national
group for the health professions to which government could turn
for regulation, even if the American constitutional system had
permitted such an arrangement. </p>

<p>Licensing of pharmacists and physicians, which was the central
government's responsibility in European nations, was, in the
United States, a power reserved to each individual state. In the
era of Andrew Jackson, any form of licensing that appeared to
give a monopoly to the educated was attacked as a contradiction
of American democratic ideals. State after state repealed the
medical licensing laws adopted in earlier days. Practical
concerns also supported repeal: Legislators preferred to leave it
to the patients to decide which of the many competing theories of
medicine was the best. Instead of moving toward a national system
of licensing for health professionals, therefore, individual
states were deregulating the professions. American medical
schools were similarly unregulated, and many flourished-some no
better than diploma mills. The states did not begin
reestablishment of medical licensing until the 1880s, and even
then the movement was spotty, with a wide range of standards.'
Pharmacists, also seeking to raise standards and limit
competition, likewise fought at the state level for licensing,
since the U.S. Constitution placed in the hands of states the
regulation of the health professions. Although some requirements
for labeling of over-the counter medicines would come with the
Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 as an exercise of the federal
right to regulate interstate commerce, in general, the nineteenth
and early twentieth century interpretation of the Constitution
favored a strict division between state and federal powers. </p>

<p>The status of legislative control of dangerous drugs during
the nineteenth century may be summed up as follows: The United
States had no practical control over the health professions, no
representative national health organizations to aid the
government in drafting regulations, and no controls on the
labeling, composition, or advertising of compounds that might
contain opiates or cocaine. The United States not only proclaimed
a free marketplace, it practiced this philosophy with regard to
narcotics in a manner unrestrained at every level of preparation
and consumption. </p>

<p>Through a slower pace of professional development, the United
States also lagged behind Britain and other European countries in
establishing broadly based organizations representing the
nation's physicians or pharmacists to which the central
government could turn for regulation. Second, the form of
government adopted in the United States, a federation of partly
independent states, was a conscious attempt to prevent
establishment of an all-powerful central government
characteristic of Europe. In the nineteenth century, this
remarkably successful form of government entailed each state
making its own regulation if it wished to; the result was an
array of controls that varied from one state to another. In fact,
states made little attempt to control addictive drugs until quite
late in the last century, and those efforts did not prove very
effective. </p>

<p>During the first part of the nineteenth century, the amount of
opiates used in the United States may have been comparable to
that used in Britain, where some areas, notably the fen counties,
had a fairly large per capita consumption. Inhabitants there
often took a dose of laudanum or some form of opium daily to keep
away the fevers associated with the marshlands.8 More generally,
parents reputedly purchased one or another form of opium to rub
on the gums of teething infants or to spoon-feed a child to
induce sleep so that the mother without provision for child care
could work in the local factory. These accounts are anecdotal,
but recent historical studies do suggest that the taking of some
form of opium for pain, sleep, or to ward off illness was not
uncommon. The occasional death of an infant from an overdose of
opium or the suicide of an adult by means of opium prompted
parliamentary interest in the distribution and labeling of the
drug. In large measure, the 1868 Pharmacy Act was the result. One
should note however, that through the provisions of the act and
the designation of the Pharmaceutical Society as the most
responsible body, the pharmacists also achieved some control over
the profession and a lead on the other health professions. A
somewhat similar victory for U.S. pharmacy would be found in the
details of the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914.9 </p>

<p>In nineteenth-century America, the unimpeded importation of
opium and the free economy in opiates do give an advantage to the
historian, for estimates of per capita consumption are more
reliable when there are few restrictions on the importation,
sale, and consumption of a product. Because the growth of poppies
within the country and preparation of opium from them seem to
have been a minor contributor to American use, the import
statistics, begun in 1840 and continued to the present day, are
reliable as a guide to domestic consumption until the Harrison
Act of 1914. Certainly the minimum level and the trend can be
observed. After the Harrison Act, these statistics grew less
reliable, for smuggling becomes a more uncertain variable, but we
can say that at least during the nineteenth century the annual
per capita consumption rose steadily from about 12 grains in 1840
(an average single dose being one grain) until the mid-1890s,
when it reached 52 grains annually per capita. Then statistics
show that average individual consumption gradually subsided up to
1914, by which time the per capita rate had fallen back to the
level of about 1880.&quot; In Great Britain, the per capita
consumption declined during the latter half of the nineteenth
century.&quot; During that same period, opium use in the United
States rose dramatically. The peak of opiate addiction in the
United States occurred about the turn of the century, when the
number probably was close to 250,000 in a population of 76
million, a rate so far never equaled or exceeded. 12 Heroin had
been introduced into the pharmacy in 1898 and had contrasting
impacts in Britain and the United States. In New York City, the
addiction capital of the United States, heroin became the drug of
choice for recreational addicts, and the number of addicts was
measured in the tens of thousands by 1920. In Britain, the
addiction rate for heroin addicts by 1920 was minuscule. 13 Of
course, the use of drugs is determined by many factors, but I
would like to suggest that the contrast in easy availability of
narcotics in America and Britain-created by political and social
factors removed from considerations of addiction-underlay the
strikingly different rates of addiction each country experienced
well into this century. The rise in addiction with which we are
more familiar, that of the 1950s and more recently, appears to be
associated with additional factors that will be discussed later. </p>

<p>Americans have something to learn from their earlier and
extensive consumption of opiates, including heroin, and also
massive consumption of cocaine, which occurred before World War
I. This era is forgotten. We commonly act as if the heroin
&quot;epidemic&quot; of the 1960s or the current cocaine
&quot;epidemic&quot; is a new phenomenon in the United States,
that the widespread use of a drug implies that legalization or
&quot;decriminalization&quot; is the only reasonable response.
The history of attempts at legislative control in the United
States suggests that other courses may be effective and that
these alternatives to legalization appear to have reduced
enormous opiate and cocaine consumption in the United States
earlier in this century. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider
these early efforts at narcotic limitation if we are to approach
contemporary policy issues with an appreciation of the range of
policy options that reduce or encourage ingestion of these
substances. For in spite of the great difference in addiction
rates between the United States and Great Britain in 1920, the
United States did reduce its addiction rate to a relatively small
number. On the other hand, the low heroin addiction rate in Great
Britain prior to the 1950s did not prove a protection against
drug problems in that nation, although the level of use in
Britain has not reached the proportions to which we are
accustomed in the United States. Clearly the social and legal
factors affecting drug use are complex, and there is no single
influence that determines a particular level of drug use and
abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER OPIUM AND OPIATES TO 1914</b>
</p>

<p>The role of opium and its derivatives in the United States can
be traced independently from cocaine until 1914, when these
substances were linked together as &quot;narcotics&quot; through
the Harrison Act. Technically, only the opiates are narcotics,
that is, sleep-inducing, and they all have different effects.
Nevertheless, most dangerous drugs, including cannabis, were
grouped under the rubric &quot;narcotics&quot; from at least the
1920s until the 1960s. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, opium was available in many forms derived
from crude opium long before the nineteenth century. In America,
the two developments that spurred both consumption and concern
about opium were (1) the isolation of morphine and its injection
into the body with hypodermic syringes and (2) the introduction
of smoking opium, which had been brought to the United States
mainly by a feared minority, Chinese laborers imported to help
build western railroads. The much greater ease of addiction
through use of morphine compared to the more dilute forms
employed previously focused attention on the drug, medical
practitioners, and modern technology in the form of the
hypodermic syringe. </p>

<p>Consumption of opium in the United States rose steadily before
and after the Civil War. There had been complaints before the war
about &quot;opium drunkards&quot; by such prominent and
progressive physicians as Oliver Wendell Holmes, but in the
second half of the century, physicians, as well as the general
public, widely deplored opium and morphine addiction. To be
addicted to morphine was to harbor a shameful secret to be hidden
from others at whatever cost, a point illustrated in Eugene
O'Neill's moving play about his own family, Long Day's Journey
into Night. Written in his later years, it was based on his
mother's addiction by a thoughtless physician, and the pain of
this memory had remained so great that O'Neill would not permit
the play's production during his lifetime. The leading American
surgeon and the first professor of surgery at The Johns Hopkins
Hospital, William Stewart Halsted, was a morphine addict for the
last several decades of his life. His secret was kept hidden
carefully until the publication of Sir William Osler's private
diary in 1969.&quot; Osler had been Halsted's physician while
Osler was on the Hopkins faculty. Halsted's addiction did not
appear to interfere with his work. </p>

<p>Americans received opium and morphine not only from their
physicians for pain; they could receive what they wanted, for
whatever reason they chose, over the counter or from mail order
catalogues. The American free enterprise system, coupled with the
federal system of government, meant that a bottle heavily laced
with morphine could be sold across state lines as an
&quot;addiction cure&quot; and affirmed on the label to contain
no morphine whatsoever, quite within the law. States could pass
laws restricting such advertising, but they were not inclined to
do so. Patent medicine companies were the leading advertisers in
American newspapers. They developed an ingenious protection from
prying investigations or public pressure to reveal secret
formulas, or from any state requirement to make only valid claims
for effectiveness: The proprietary manufacturers included in
their lucrative contracts with newspapers a proviso that the
advertising agreement would be void if the state in which the
newspaper was published enacted any laws affecting the sale or
manufacture of the nostrums. 11 </p>

<p>In the nation's capital, the manufacturers also fought off
requirements that their nostrums be labeled as to contents. Bills
to enact such a law under the interstate commerce clause of the
Constitution were defeated repeatedly, but in the 1890s a new
reforming spirit was evident in the nation. These reforms were
extensive, ranging from control over the use of forest land, to
government inspection of meat and other comestibles and laws
relating to adulterants in foods, and to drugs considered unsafe.
Attention to the danger of narcotics using the term
broadly-accompanied the peak of per capita consumption in the
United States. It is clear that what were regarded as the most
negative aspects of drug use led to the passage of the new
legislation. The simplest reform, correct labeling, was part of
the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Any over-the-counter medicine
- commonly these would be &quot;patent medicines&quot;-had to be
labeled correctly as to inclusion of any of the following drugs:
morphine, cocaine, cannabis, or chloral hydrate. A long-desired
reform, it simply informed the purchaser whether any of these
drugs were present; it did not prevent purchase or restrict the
amount of the drug. 16 Nevertheless, reports at the time indicate
that the amount of these substances dropped from a third to a
half as a response to public concern.17 Although the newspapers
remained quiet, widely read magazines such as Collier's and
Ladies Home Journal railed against patent medicines, especially
against morphine and cocaine. Even after passage of the
truth-in-labeling laws, the magazines continued their exposes
unabated until the next major step, which was restriction on the
availability of the drugs themselves.&quot; </p>

<p>Tracing the movement to restriction, as opposed to labeling
accuracy, requires a step back to the mid-nineteenth century.
Patent medicines are thought to have created some addiction, but
the number of addicts is difficult to estimate. That physicians
addicted or assisted in the addiction of patients is more
certain. The problem of iatroaddiction initially was approached
by limiting renewal of prescriptions for opiates. These legal
controls were mostly in the form of additions to the health
statutes and depended for their efficacy on the judgments of
physicians and pharmacists. These controls would not, of course,
affect interstate commerce in narcotics or the familiar patent
medicines, which still could be bought over the counter. No
consistent police efforts to enforce these laws appear to have
been undertaken.18 </p>

<p>As the public and leaders of the health professions became
more aware of the growing number of those addicted to opiates,
chiefly morphine, state laws were amended to be more stringent,
and the police occasionally staged crackdowns. As will be
recalled, however, the professions were pretty much unorganized
and struggling to achieve mandatory licensing; a threat to take
away a license could not hold much fear until a license was
required to begin with. Legislators also felt, or at least
claimed, a helplessness when neighboring states did not enact
strict laws-a circumstance more familiar to us with variations
in- the legal drinking age between states-with the result that
enforcement was weak. This circumstance, combined with a poorly
trained medical profession, a lack of professional organization,
and an absence of laws controlling either patent medicine or
interstate commerce in drugs, left local controls more symbolic
than effective. </p>

<p>The nineteenth century's last decade brought the rise of what
would come to be called the Progressive Movement, a set of
reforms usually taking the form of federal laws affecting the
entire nation with the ostensible purpose of improving the
nation's morals or resisting the selfish actions of the rich and
powerful. Alongside it grew a temperance, soon a prohibition,
movement that would eventuate in the Eighteenth Amendment
mandating prohibition of alcohol distribution for nonmedical
purposes in the United States. In many ways, of course, the
antialcohol movement was part of the Progressive Era; its
startling success and later dramatic repeal have given the
alcohol issue a somewhat separate development in our minds, but
the interrelation between the battles against alcohol and against
narcotics is an important one. The antialcohol crusade helped
establish the attitude that there could be no compromise with the
forces of evil, that &quot;moderation&quot; was a false concept
when applied to alcohol: Prohibition was the only logical or
moral policy when dealing with this great national problem. By
the nineteenth century a new wave of state prohibition laws was
enacted. These were tempered by the contemporary constitutional
understanding that a state prohibition law did not prevent
purchase of liquor from a &quot;wet&quot; state, for that would
be a form of interstate commerce and not subject to the states'
powers. This assumption helped placate some doubters about
prohibition, but the staunch fighters against alcohol also sought
to remove that loophole. This they did through the Webb-Kenyon
Act of 1913. Without going into the details of the broad and
involved movement that led to national prohibition, we should
note that the significance for the control of narcotics is that
another dangerous substance, over which there was even more
dispute as to the means of control, progressed inexorably toward
a policy of &quot;no maintenance&quot; and no compromise. The
moral question of how to deal with a dangerous substance was
being fought out over alcohol, but the case would be stronger
even with narcotics when that issue was brought to national
deliberation. </p>

<p>The means by which the narcotics issue arose at the federal
level was accidental. Certainly it would have come to the
attention of Congress and the president eventually as a corollary
to the alcohol prohibition movement or as a way of controlling
addiction, which was becoming a target of journalist reformers
and physicians. It was acquisition of the Philippines through the
Spanish-American War that occasioned action by the federal
government. </p>

<p>Again, in order to understand how the Philippines forced the
central government to take action on opium, it is necessary to
appreciate the divisions between federal and state powers that
were so marked until the last half-century. The Philippines,
unlike a state, came directly and wholly under the control of the
federal government. At last, Congress could not avoid making
decisions on such matters as the local availability of opium.
Opium had been provided to Chinese on the Philippine Islands
through a Spanish government monopoly. Civil Governor William
Howard Taft considered whether the monopoly should be
reinstituted. It was his judgment that this would be reasonable
and that the profits from the opium monopoly could be used to
help educate Filipinos, a task the United States eagerly accepted
as it sought to provide a model government for its first colony.
20 </p>

<p>It was at the point in 1903, when this reinstitution was
passing through the Philippine government under the eye of Civil
Governor Taft, that the moral question of compromising with
&quot;evil&quot; affected the future of opium's legal
availability in that land. Missionaries in Manila and in the
United States had learned that &quot;tainted money&quot; from
opium sales was to be employed for education, and they besought
President Theodore Roosevelt to prevent this moral wrong. He
ordered Taft to stop the bill, and that was the end of it. The
mood of moral leaders in the United States was sufficient during
the first few years of this century to prevent any such
&quot;maintenance&quot; program, even if it was restricted, as
promised, to the Chinese in the Philippines. This immediate
reaction to allowing opium to be used for purely
&quot;recreational&quot; purposes, coming even before the Food
and Drug Act, gave a signal as to how the federal government
would respond to later questions regarding the legal supply of
opium to individuals, not for medical reasons but for enjoyment
or to satisfy their addiction. </p>

<p>In response to the veto from Washington, Governor Taft
appointed an Opium Investigation Committee to consider how other
Asian territories handled the opium problem. This committee
introduces us to Bishop Charles Henry Brent, the Protestant
Episcopal bishop of the Philippines, who had come out with Taft
to help in Americanization of this new possession. Bishop Brent
later would become world famous for his pioneer efforts to launch
the ecumenical movement among Christian churches, but his second
claim to fame was as a world leader against nonmedicinal uses of
narcotics. He was appointed to the committee, which traveled to
Japan, Formosa, Shanghai, Saigon, and Singapore examining how
other nations dealt with the opium user. He and the other members
of the committee found the Japanese policy in Formosa, a Japanese
possession since its seizure from China in 1895, to be the most
effective and enlightened. Japan opposed smoking opium but did
not try to stop confirmed addicts abruptly from indulging in
their habit. Japan, hoped to &quot;mature out&quot; the opium
smokers and leave an opium-free colony. In Japan, itself, opium
use was controlled stringently by the government, rare even among
Chinese aliens, and strongly deprecated by Japanese society. </p>

<p>The Philippine Opium Investigation Committee recommended that
(1) male opium smokers over 21 should be registered in order to
receive opium from a reinstituted government monopoly and (2)
after a three-year period, the amount provided the smokers be
reduced gradually until the smokers had been completely weaned
from the drug. 1 But Congress reacted more sternly. Congress
decreed immediate opium prohibition, except for medicinal
purposes, for all native Filipinos; non-Filipinos-mostly
Chinese-were allowed a three-year period of use. Over 12,000
non-Filipino opium users were registered, and their usual dosage
was maintained for two-and-onehalf years. During the final six
months of the three-year leniency period ending March 1908, the
opium provided was gradually reduced to zero. For official
purposes, opium smoking had stopped in the Philippine Islands.
One additional point: The opium dispensing stations established
under these laws were the first American narcotic clinics,
although their goal was not long-term maintenance but rather
registration and detoxification. </p>

<p>The Philippine situation forced the federal government to take
a stand on opium use for nonmedicinal purposes, and the decision
was to prohibit. To Congress, once the question was posed,
compromise with narcotics was not a politically practical
alternative. The Philippines also gave the United States
leadership of the international control of narcotics, a role it
still holds. It was apparent to the Opium Investigating Committee
that the solution to the Philippine opium problem lay in the
control of international trafficking in opium, as well as in the
curtailment of opium production in the original producing states,
such as India, China, Burma, Persia, and Turkey, to name some of
the most prominent sites for the cultivation of the opium poppy. </p>

<p>At the time that the Philippines were perceived to be a victim
of external sources of opium, the United States was having
increasing problems with the Chinese Empire. Owing to
maltreatment of Chinese in the United States, merchants in China
planned a voluntary embargo on American goods. This worried
American industrialists, wholesalers, exporters, and the federal
government. China had also embarked on a vigorous effort to rid
itself of opium use and, employing draconian methods, was having
some success. As a means to indicate good will to China, to aid
the Philippine opium problem, and to take an international
leadership position on a moral issue of the times, the United
States proposed, following Bishop Brent's suggestion to President
Roosevelt, to convene an international meeting at Shanghai to
consider the opium traffic among nations and to suggest ways in
which China's antiopium campaign might be aided. </p>

<p>Thus, the Shanghai Opium Commission came into being. It would
meet during February 1909, with Bishop Brent as its elected
president. The group was designated a &quot;commission&quot;
because the United States was unable to gain approval for a more
powerful convocation, a &quot;conference,&quot; which under
international law could draft a treaty that would, if ratified,
bind the signatory states. A &quot;commission,&quot; on the other
hand, could make findings of only fact or opinion. In addition to
the United States and China, those who accepted invitations to
Shanghai were Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Persia,
Japan, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Portugal, Siam, and
Russia. Turkey accepted but did not send a representative. Persia
was represented by a local merchant. </p>

<p>The resolutions adopted by the commission were merely
recommendations and, even as such, had a comfortable vagueness
that allowed a latitude of interpretations. For example,
Resolution Three, taking cognizance of the near unanimous
agreement that opium for nonmedicinal uses should be prohibited
or &quot;carefully regulated,&quot; called upon nations to
&quot;reexamine&quot; their laws. This could hardly be considered
a clarion call for prohibition of nonmedical uses, but it was
Brent's goal to achieve a series of resolutions that at least
pointed in the direction of action to control traffic in
narcotics, with the hope that a future conference would enact a
treaty initiating such control.&quot; </p>

<p>The road from the Shanghai Opium Commission to the Hague Opium
Conference, which convened in December 1911 and resulted in the
Opium Convention of 1912, was a tortuous one, but after the
Shanghai meeting, the United States continued to press for a
second and more significant gathering. Eventually, the nations
gathered in The Hague, and once again Bishop Brent was elected
the presiding officer. </p>

<p>The Hague Opium Convention (which concerned cocaine as well as
opium) placed the burden of narcotic control on the domestic
legislation of each nation. Chapter Three of the convention
called for control of each phase of the preparation and
distribution of medicinal opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, and
any new derivative that could be shown to have similar properties
.24 </p>

<p>The convention was not put into force by the dozen nations who
attended the First Opium Conference, for it was agreed that the
requirements would be held in abeyance until all forty-six world
powers had signed and ratified the convention. Eventually three
conferences were held, the second in 1913 and the third in 1914,
only weeks before the outbreak of World War 1. A compromise was
reached regarding the implementation of the treaty: Any ratifying
nation was permitted to put the treaty into effect in 1915, even
if ratification had not been unanimous. But only seven nations
did this by the end of the World War and the beginning of the
Versailles treaty negotiations in 1919. The United States
supported incorporating the Hague Convention into the Versailles
treaty, so that ratification of the treaty ending World War I
would at the same time bring the nation under the requirements of
the Hague Convention, which required national and domestic
legislation to control the preparation and distribution of
opiates and cocaine. Of course, the United States never did
ratify the Versailles treaty, but it had already ratified the
Hague Convention in 1913 and had put it into effect in 1915. One
significant result of the inclusion of the Hague Convention in
the Versailles treaty was the passage in Britain of the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1920, an action taken not because of any serious
problem with addiction but because, by ratifying the Versailles
treaty, Britain had committed itself to comprehensive domestic
legislation. 25 </p>

<p><b>DOMESTIC NARCOTIC LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES</b> </p>

<p>During the year or so prior to the Shanghai Opium Commission,
the United States suggested topics to be discussed in 1909, and
one of the topics was a report on domestic antinarcotic
legislation. Americans understood that strong and enforced
domestic legislation in other nations would result in diminishing
the flow of drugs into the United States, but would other nations
understand why the United States had no national antinarcotic
legislation whatsoever? Americans knew that federal-state
separation of powers made a national antinarcotic law rather
difficult, but the State Department decided that something should
be on the books when the U.S. delegation arrived in Shanghai. </p>

<p>The simplest law that could be framed and stand a chance of
passage by the U.S. Congress before the commission opened was one
that excluded from the United States opium not intended for
legitimate medical uses or, in other words, opium prepared for
smoking. Here there was an ironic combination of political
factors. The United States hoped one of the major effects of the
Shanghai Commission would be to placate China with regard to the
poor treatment given Chinese nationals in the United States. Such
treatment was in violation of our treaty obligations with China.
The impetus for banning smoking opium from the United States,
however, had developed from the fear and loathing of the Chinese,
who were associated intimately with this particular manner of
ingesting opium. Thus, the negative American attitude toward
Chinese aliens gave the push that passed a &quot;face
saving&quot; law designed to show China the good will of the
United States. </p>

<p>After the law was enacted on February 9, 1909, it was
announced dramatically in Shanghai to the other nations as proof
of American sincerity.26 And yet no one in the American
delegation or within the State Department had any illusions that
this law would control domestic narcotic use. Additional
legislation was seen as imperative both to curtail the American
narcotics problem and to display an American example to other
nations where the implementation of narcotics control programs
was essential to the solution of the American domestic problem. </p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton Wright, a physician with political interests who
had been appointed opium commissioner by the State Department in
1908, oversaw the State Department's preparation for the Shanghai
meeting, which included culling information from police
departments, physicians, pharmaceutical houses, etc., regarding
the narcotic problem and consumption in the United States. Bishop
Brent was the chairman of the delegation, but after his elevation
to the commission's presidency, Wright became the acting head.
Back in Washington after the commission meeting, Wright took up
the battle for an international meeting that could frame a treaty
and played a leading role in the preparation of domestic
antinarcotic legislation. He had opposition within the State
Department on both questions, but he finally won the assent of
Philander C. Knox, the secretary of state, and moved ahead. </p>

<p>Wright, who combined an aggressive personal style with
self-righteousness and a thirst for political preferment, was
less effective than he otherwise might have been. He never got
the prize plum for which he yearned, the ministry to China, and
his chief claim for notability, the Anti-Narcotic Act of 1914,
known even then as the &quot;Harrison&quot; Act, left him at the
moment of achievement with almost no further role in the
antinarcotic movement. Eventually, he volunteered to help the
wounded on the western front during World War 1, was injured 27
there in an automobile accident, and died in 1917 in Washington.
His indomitable wife, Elizabeth Washburn Wright, carried on his
28 battle for world control of narcotics until her death in 1952.
</p>

<p>In late 1909 Dr. Wright proposed a domestic law that would be
based on the federal government's power of taxation. The
alternative federal power was that over interstate commerce, but
Wright believed that taxation would result in a detailed
accounting of narcotics from their introduction into the United
States to their distribution to manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers, including pharmacists and physicians. Heavy fines
would be levied on anyone not keeping records accurately or
selling and transferring these products without proper reporting
and payment of taxes. </p>

<p>Wright tried to solve the federal/state dichotomy in this
manner: The information obtained by this proposed law would be
made available to state boards of pharmacy and medicine, which
would then take appropriate action to ensure that &quot;the
proper relations . . . should exist between the physician, the
dispensing druggist, [and] those who have some real need of the
drugs.' &quot;29 So it is evident that at this early stage, two
years before the Hague Convention, Wright and the State
Department did not envision a federal role in policing the
relationships between, say, an addict and his or her supplying
pharmacist or physician. The sanctity of the state's police
powers would be maintained; the federal government would supply
only information. Reformers believed that the information,
however, could lead a responsible state agency to take only one
action, that is, to curb the supply of narcotics to those who did
not have a medical need for it-and &quot;mere&quot; addicts did
not fall into that category. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Foster Anti-Narcotic Bill (1910-1911)</b> </p>

<p>Republican Congressman David Foster of Vermont introduced
Wright's bill in April 1910. In addition to opium and cocaine, as
in the eventual Harrison Act, the bill was aimed at cannabis
(marijuana) and chloral hydrate, the same substances the Food and
Drug Act of 1906 required to be revealed on labels. It did not
allow small amounts of the drugs in mild remedies such as cough
syrup to be exempt from the stringent reporting requirements and
their severe penalties. Druggists feared the multitude of stamps
and labels at each stage; the fines, which would range from $500
to $5,000; and the one-to-five-year jail sentences. The word
&quot;knowingly&quot; did not qualify the prohibited actions,
making it likely that simple errors without any intention to
deceive would result in horrendous punishments. Although support
for the bill could be found, the individuals in the drug trade
would not endorse the detailed and hazardous provisions of the
Foster Bill. It never came to a vote in the Sixty-first Congress,
which ended in March 1911.30 </p>

<p>The next Congress was marked by a significant change: For the
first time in almost two decades, the Democrats gained control of
the House of Representatives. The South now had achieved new
importance, in that committee chairmanships changed hands. In the
Sixty-second Congress the Foster Bill became the Harrison Bill,
named after Francis Burton Harrison, a New York City Democrat who
served on the Foreign Relations Committee. Dr. Wright continued
his difficult task of trying to obtain the most stringent bill
consistent with winning essential political support from the
medical and pharmaceutical interests and now from the Democratic
Party. In order to mitigate the severity of the original Foster
Bill, the drug trades established the National Drug Trade
Conference, which would represent the major trade associations
and try to reach a compromise position on the complex
antinarcotic bill. The NDTC, which first met in Washington, D.C.,
in January 1913, provided the most powerful influence on the
writing of what would become known as the Harrison Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The attitude of the newly influential southern Democrats
toward any potential invasion of states' rights now had to be
taken more seriously. These politicians feared an interference
with the South's local laws, which enforced racial segregation
and Negro disenfranchisement. They remembered the era of
&quot;reconstruction,&quot; when the North ruled the South
following 1865, and wanted to maintain the authority the white
citizenry had subsequently won with the withdrawal of troops and
&quot;carpetbaggers.&quot; The narcotic control proposals
threatened to intrude federal authority into the states,
affecting local pharmacists and physicians and threatening to
reach right into a neighborhood and send an individual to federal
prison. Furthermore, this example of using the federal tax power
primarily to achieve a moral end-for the taxes were not intended
to bring in a significant revenue but rather to force disclosure
and compliance with rules of narcotics distribution-could be a
precedent for other concerns brewing in the United States, such
as protecting Negro voting rights in the South. </p>

<p>Dr. Wright, therefore, faced a new set of attitudes in the
Democratic-controlled House. He reacted by stressing the impact
of narcotics, especially cocaine, on Negroes. He attributed
attacks on whites to the crazed Negro cocaine fiend. He also
argued that many poor Negroes would not have the energy or
knowledge to send away for the cocaine, so the conclusion must be
that northern businessmen who did not care about the South's
concerns were shipping-via interstate commerce-cocaine to
Negroes. Further, unscrupulous or ignorant employers were said to
be supplying cocaine to their Negro workers .32 </p>

<p>One further concern about the precedent the antinarcotic law
would provide related to the flourishing prohibition movement. As
prohibition was achieved in state after state, the loophole for
at least the upper and middle classes was that alcohol could be
ordered across state lines and shipped into a dry state, for
interstate commerce was regulated by the federal government,
which so far was not teetotal. The Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913,
however, was passed to close this loophole, survived President
Taft's veto, and, much to the surprise of many, was declared
constitutional by the Supreme Court. This occurrence removed one
of the stumbling blocks to the Harrison Bill, for now a national
antinarcotic law could not serve as a precedent for curtailing
interstate commerce in a dangerous substance. </p>

<p>In the course of all this maneuvering, no one rallied to the
defense of any of the drugs named for control except that
occasionally cannabis was described by someone as not
habit-forming or not as serious as opium or cocaine. Perhaps
because the cannabis problem was not seen to be serious or
because the drug did not seem so dangerous, it was dropped from
the proposed law. Chloral hydrate, a sleeping medicine, was also
dropped. The attitude toward opium and cocaine, however, was
almost totally condemnatory. The only question was how to control
their distribution most efficiently, since they had medicinal
value but were also considered dangerously addicting. This was in
sharp contrast with alcohol; its use divided the nation, and huge
legitimate industries depended upon its continued consumption. </p>

<p>The government and the trades eventually reached agreement on
the proposed law by moderating the record-keeping provisions,
reducing penalties, and allowing the sale of patent medicines
with small amounts of narcotics in them. Representative Harrison
introduced it in June 1913, and it was passed quickly by the
House. In the Senate some amendments were offered, a few with an
apparent goal of destroying the bill's chances of passage. In
August of 1914, though, the Senate passed the bill, albeit with a
few modifications that were compromised in Conference Committee.
Finally, on December 17, 1914, President Wilson signed it into
law, to become effective March 1, 1915. At last the United States
had redeemed its pledge to other nations that it would enact a
stringent law, as it had urged every other nation to do. </p>

<p>The significance of the Harrison Act to strategists like Dr.
Wright, though, was more than just the satisfaction of redeeming
pledges made to questioning representatives of other nations. For
him, the Harrison Act was the implementation of the Hague
Convention of 1912, which called upon signatories to enact
domestic legislation controlling narcotics supplies and
distribution. Understood as the fulfillment of treaty
obligations, the Harrison Act would have the authority to usurp
the states' police powers, for the Constitution in Article Six
gives treaties concluded by the United States supremacy over the
laws of states. This would resolve the problem of states' rights
interfering with the ability of a national law to require a
uniform compliance with strict narcotics control .33 </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court at first did not give a very
strict interpretation to the Harrison Act. In the first Jin Fuey
Moy case (1916), the Court declared by a six-to-two majority that
the Harrison Act could not be understood as having been required
by the Hague Convention and that physicians could prescribe as
they saw fit, even to simple addicts. 34 This decision was a
stunning blow to federal enforcement, which, from the first day
of the act's implementation, was directed at pharmacists and
physicians who sold prescriptions or treated addicts without any
intent to cure them. </p>

<p>World War 1, arriving at almost the same time as the Harrison
Act, profoundly affected American attitudes, creating an intense
desire to purify the nation as it girded itself to fight for
democracy against the barbarism of the Kaiser. The fall of Russia
and the spread of Bolshevism intensified fears of contagion and
the desire to be sure that the United States remained pure and
strong. Prohibition took giant strides during World War 1. The
Prohibition Amendment in an early form nearly passed the House in
December 1914, a week after the passage of the Harrison Act. In
1916 it did pass, and by January 1919 Prohibition had become part
of the Constitution as the Eighteenth Amendment. Earlier,
Congress had passed wartime prohibition, which was intended to
save grain for the war effort as well as to promote efficiency in
war production plants. Similarly, a battle was being fought to
overturn the Jin Fuey Moy decision, which had weakened the
government's intention for the Harrison Act. A Treasury
Department committee reported that the number of addicts in the
nation was over a million.&quot; These exaggerated figures, as
well as a fear about returning veterans having become addicted on
the battlefield and the specter of alcohol prohibition, which
might drive alcoholics to morphine and cocaine, led to a new
attempt to put teeth into the Harrison Act. This time the
government was successful. </p>

<p>In March 1919, two months after the ratification of the
Eighteenth Amendment (which would go into effect a year later),
the Supreme Court ingeniously decided, five to four, that to call
a prescription for narcotics intended to supply a
&quot;mere&quot; addict with maintenance doses was an error, for
such a script could not be considered a true prescription given
in the proper conduct of medical practice. Since it was not a
prescription, the issuing physician had conveyed narcotics
without the required tax; he had therefore violated the Harrison
Act and could be arrested. The four dissenting justices were the
conservatives, who argued that this was an invasion of states'
police powers, while the majority, including Holmes and Brandeis,
felt that more power had to be given the government if it was to
carry out its duty to protect the public from such an insidious
evil .36 At last, the intent of the reformers had been achieved:
Simple maintenance was outlawed, and the federal government could
take action nationwide to arrest and convict health professionals
who practiced it. Narcotics now had a no-maintenance policy,
which a few months later would also be the policy for alcohol.
Enforcement of both prohibitions would be the responsibility of a
unit in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, reflecting the similarity
of the two conceptions. </p>

<p><b>Enforcement During the 1920s</b> </p>

<p>Several additional laws completed the early legislative
structure of American control of opium and cocaine. Some were
minor, such as a stipulation that no finished products such as
heroin or morphine could be imported into the United States.37
The law stated that only coca leaves and crude opium could be
imported and that the finished products, cocaine, morphine,
heroin, codeine, etc., were to be manufactured in American
pharmaceutical factories, which were given a monopoly to produce
these substances. This may have made up for revenues lost, as the
amounts sold legally in the United States fell after the Harrison
Act. Other laws dealt with transshipment of drugs 38 across the
United States for foreign markets. </p>

<p><b>Heroin</b> </p>

<p>Perhaps the most important addition to the Harrison Act's
control of opiates and cocaine came in 1924, when the United
States banned the importation of opium to be used for the
manufacture of heroin.39 The observance of federal-state
boundaries is evident in this law, for it does not ban the
manufacture of heroin altogether but only the importation of
crude opium for that purpose. Just that much seemed to be within
the power of the federal government. Also, this did not require
the seizure of heroin legally available in the United States for
cough medicines (the original claim for heroin's value) or for
certain other purposes, chiefly pain control or &quot;twilight
sleep&quot; during child birth. </p>

<p>Heroin had been made available commercially by the Bayer
Company of Germany in 1898 as a superior cough suppressant.40 The
Bayer Company believed that the addition of acetyl groups to the
basic molecule would make morphine more palatable, and this
product, diacetylmorphine, the company named Heroin, a trademark
that was protected until Germany lost such protections as a
result of losing the First World War. Similarly, by adding an
acetyl group to salicylic acid to make it less irritating to the
stomach when taken for joint pains, the Bayer Company launched
another successful venture. In 1899 the company named sodium
acetyl salicylic acid Aspirin, which similarly was protected by
trademark until World War 1. Few pharmaceutical firms can take
credit for naming and distributing two drugs that remain among
the most popular in Western society even after nearly a hundred
years. </p>

<p>Heroin essentially had been unrestricted in the United States
prior to the Harrison Act, and by 1912 in New York City it had
replaced morphine as the drug of recreational choice among
youthful males, according to the records of Bellevue Hospital.
The addictive nature of heroin had been recognized rather
quickly, for the AMA issued a warning in 1902. Heroin was popular
because it could be inhaled by sniffing, like cocaine, as well as
injected by needle. When injected into the bloodstream, heroin
crossed the blood-brain barrier more quickly than morphine and
therefore gave a more intense, but briefer, &quot;high.&quot;
During the years of intense concern over social control, which
began with the First World War, heroin became linked with male
gang violence and the commission of crimes. Some believed that
heroin stimulated the user to commit crimes or at least provided
the courage to pull off a bank robbery or mugging. In the early
1920s most of the crime in New York City was blamed on drug use,
chiefly the opiates, including heroin.41 </p>

<p>The preference for heroin over morphine by recreational users,
and the belief that other opiates could fulfill heroin's role as
a painkiller and cough suppressant, led to a move to ban heroin
for medical purposes. The heroin problem also contributed to
American fear of foreign nations after World War 1, for the drug
was being manufactured in other countries and then smuggled into
the United States. The Swiss drug industries, for example,
produced large amounts of heroin, which found its way into this
country. Heroin's image as a foreign product popular with feared
domestic groups helped support an isolationist stance,
illustrated by the American refusal to join or even recognize the
League of Nations. Influential congressmen, such as Stephen G.
Porter, Republican chairman of the House Committee on Foreign
Relations, urged that all heroin production in the United States
be stopped. As an example he would try to get other nations 42 to
follow at the Geneva Opium Conferences of 1924 and 1925. </p>

<p>The United States did enact the legislation sought by
Congressman Porter, but it failed to achieve its goals at the
meetings in Geneva. In fact, in disgust at the refusal of other
nations to agree to curb production of poppies and coca bushes,
the ultimate source of heroin 43 and cocaine, the United States
walked out of the conference. The United States, which had
founded the world antinarcotic movement in Shanghai and The
Hague, now saw it taken over by the League of Nations (as the
Versailles treaty had mandated) and controlled by the very
nations the United States sought to shame or force into a
narcotics policy that the United States viewed as responsible.
American participation in the worldwide effort then fell to a low
point until the 1930s, when participation was resumed in
international meetings. By the outbreak of World War II, the
United States was again achieving significant participation in
international antidrug activities. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMERICAN DOMESTIC CONTROL TO THE MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b>
</p>

<p>The use of cocaine, which had been in &quot;soft&quot; drinks
like Coca-Cola until 1903 and was available easily to sniff as a
treatment for sinusitis or hay fever, fell precipitously after
reaching a peak somewhere around 1905. By the 1930s cocaine use
had receded, and during the 1950s physicians and narcotics agents
alike described cocaine use as a problem that once was serious in
the United States but now was practically absent. Several reasons
for its reduced use can be suggested. The drug had been
introduced as a wonder substance-Freud had called it the first
medicine that worked as an antidepressant. The Parke-Davis
Company manufactured it after 1885 in many forms for drinking,
smoking, inhaling, or rubbing on the skin. Within about a decade,
warnings surfaced. Consumption peaked about twenty years after
its initial distribution, and around the same time the accounts
of its effect on the lives of its users and its popularly
believed-although questionable-special link with southern blacks
created in the public's mind an image so fearful that cocaine's
effects became the extreme against which other drugs would be
compared. Cocaine's association with violence, paranoia, and
collapsed careers made laws against it by 1910 a popular matter.
The first strict antinarcotic law in New York State was passed in
1913 and was directed at cocaine. Al Smith, later to be an
anti-Prohibition candidate for president and critic of
Prohibition in his state while he was governor, drew the strict
anticocaine measure in his early years as a state assemblyman.44
The combination of strict laws and intense public support of
control measures brought on a reduction in consumption, which, at
the peak of its popularity, must have seemed most unlikely if not
impossible. </p>

<p>The effect of the Harrison Act, its court interpretations, and
supplementary legislation also appear to have reduced greatly the
number of opiate addicts. The medical and pharmacy professions
were denied an easy way of providing drugs. Although it is clear
that only a fraction of either profession was liberal in their
provision, this nevertheless had been enough to maintain a large
number of users. It had been argued recently that the
recreational users began to stand out more prominently, as the
medically addicted and more sedate group declined in numbers, and
that the relatively small number of addicts in the United States,
about 50,000 in 1940, would have had an &quot;underworld&quot; or
unsavory character even without the Harrison 45 Act's
criminalization of drug use. This point of view contrasts sharply
with the argument that the Harrison Act changed citizens who were
normal except for their addiction into criminals who had 46 to
violate the law to obtain their daily supply of opiates. Whatever
the reason, the number of those addicted fell from about a
quarter million around 1900 to much less than half that number by
World War II. The war effectively reduced supplies of narcotics
to the United States, and in 1945 the United States probably had
its lowest number of opiate addicts since the mid-nineteenth
century. The rise of addiction after World War 11 may have built
on the core of addicts left in the nation, but the dynamics of
the addiction epidemic that began in the 1960s appear in certain
respects to have had a different character. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>NARCOTIC CLINICS, 1913-1925</b> </p>

<p>In order to close the story of the decline in addiction after
1900, it is necessary to consider the legendary narcotic clinics
that, like the Philippine opium dispensaries, were intended to
deal with addicts who no longer could receive opiate or cocaine
supplies from local physicians .47 The first in the United States
was opened in 1912 by Charles Terry, the public health officer of
Jacksonville, Florida, where he provided both opiates and cocaine
to men and women, blacks and whites. Dr. Terry went on to become
a student of the opium problem in the United States and compiled
a classic book of reports, excerpts from articles, and
statistical information in <a
href="../Library/studies/op/opmenu.htm">The Opium Problem</a>,
published in 1928 and co-authored by Mildred Pellens. </p>

<p>Other clinics followed, particularly after the Treasury
Department, in enforcement of the Harrison Act, prosecuted or
threatened with prosecution health professionals who supplied
addicts indefinitely. A series of clinics in New England were
established at the suggestion of officials of the Internal
Revenue Bureau. In New York State, the crackdown on druggists and
physicians emanated from state law, and clinics were established
in upper New York State through state planning and authorization.
Registration of addicts was permitted so that physicians would
restrict maintenance to those already addicted. </p>

<p>In New York City, the Health Department did not wish to
provide opiates, morphine, and heroin on an indefinite basis but
did open a clinic at the city Health Department headquarters.
This clinic provided heroin, but only as an inducement to
registration and eventual detoxification and rehabilitation.
About 7,500 addicts registered, received their drug of choice in
dosages gradually decreased until uncomfortably small, usually
three to eight grains of morphine daily, and were offered
curative treatment. Most declined to be cured. Those who did
receive treatment, at North Brother Island, seemed both
unappreciative and very liable-the estimate was 95 percent - to
return to narcotics available on the street or from a physician
or druggist. </p>

<p>The Treasury Department, armed with fresh Supreme Court
decisions of March 1919, started to close down the clinics, along
with prosecuting the dispensing physicians and druggists. One
argument was that the availability of easy maintenance inhibited
cures and also that giving legal permission for maintenance
clinics undercut the Treasury Department's position when it
brought action against a professional for reckless provision of
drugs. From a legal point of view, the &quot;reckless&quot;
provider was obeying the tax laws, as was the clinic, unless the
federal government wanted to get into the question of medical
competence, which was a state, not a federal, concern. </p>

<p>Gradually the clinics were closed, the last one in 1925 in
Knoxville, Tennessee. Some had been operated poorly, others quite
responsibly with community support. Yet, because of the
intricacies of the tax powers under which the federal law
operated, all were closed, even if unfair harassment was
necessary to discourage the operation. The number of registrants
was not large, about 3,000 if we exclude the New York City
clinic, which was not intended for maintenance but for bait to
get addicts into detoxification. The number of addicts registered
under the New York State law, which provided for maintenance not
only in clinics but also from private physicians and pharmacists,
eventually totaled about 13,000 in 1920. It can be assumed,
therefore, that the clinics were not a major element in the
maintenance of addiction in the United States. One side note: The
13,000 addicted registrants in New York State in 1920 add up to
the largest number of legally supplied addicts recorded in any
Western country this century, a number not approached yet by
Britain under the socalled &quot;British System.&quot; Although
the &quot;American System&quot; preceded and surpassed in size
any scheme attempted then or subsequently in Britain, it was in
fact the large number of addicts in America that made maintenance
so unwieldy and unpopular. </p>

<p>The demise of the clinics left drug peddlers and individual
members of the health professions as the major targets of the
federal government. Generally, the physicians did not wish to
treat addicts, nor did they have any sympathy with addicts. Those
physicians who, for whatever reason, did continue to treat
addicts with maintenance doses were threatened and arrested,
unless the maintenance had been approved by the local narcotic
agent. Some maintenance was permitted, but only on a case-by-case
evaluation. From reports prepared by agents upon investigating
narcotic clinics, it appears that an acceptable life-style was a
requirement for permission to be maintained.48 </p>

<p>A theory had been advocated, mostly among maintaining
physicians in New York City, that longstanding addiction changed
the body's physiology in such a way that opiates were necessary
for the patient to remain normal.49 Too little opiate and the
patient would experience withdrawal, too much and the patient
would be &quot;high,&quot; but just the right amount would allow
normal feelings and behavior. </p>

<p>This, of course, is close to the argument made in the 1950s by
Drs. Dole and Nyswander to justify methadone maintenance. After a
series of scientific studies shortly after World War 1, the
government concluded otherwise .50 Those physicians who insisted
on maintaining patients without approval from a narcotics agent
ran a serious risk of arrest and, if convicted, loss of a medical
license and time in a federal penitentiary. In spite of the
danger, of course, some physicians supplied narcotics without
restraint or with very poor judgment, but evidence shows that
other, responsible physicians were entrapped without good reason
in order to boost the number of an agent's arrests and thereby
bolster his chances for promotion.51 An aura of fear, therefore,
accompanied a physician's decision to give an opiate to a
patient, especially a new patient. On the other hand, the
casualness with which physicians once handed out morphine or some
other opiate was reduced considerably. </p>

<p>Along with the rejection of maintenance, physicians
unfortunately had no effective medical cure available for
addiction. Several had been promoted in many forms in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century, but each had been found
to have no scientific merit .52 The problem devolved into a
decision of whether to stop opiates abruptly and thereby cause
the patient to go directly into full Withdrawalthe so-called
&quot;cold turkey&quot; approach-or gradually to reduce the
opiate over a few days or a few weeks. Because the addicted
person frequently has a threshold of average daily consumption
below which the user becomes acutely uncomfortable, and because a
yearning for heroin or morphine often persists for months or
years after the beginning of withdrawal, the decision to detoxify
abruptly or gradually usually was a difficult path for the
patient. Nevertheless, detoxification was the preferred route for
legal reasons. Two ancient warnings about detoxification, that
the patient would die in withdrawal, or that a supply cutoff
would precipitate a rash of suicides, did not materialize. </p>

<p>During the 1920s and 1930s the number of addicts diminished in
the United States. Grossly exaggerated estimates came from
antidrug entrepreneurs like Captain Richmond Pearson Hobson, who
had been a Prohibition advocate before unleashing his energies
against heroin and later marijuana as the head of several
national and international voluntary groups.&quot; Captain Hobson
attacked heroin in a most melodramatic manner, claiming there
were 4 million addicts in the United States and comparing them
all to lepers. In spite of Hobson, the concern over opiate
addicts and cocaine users declined during the two decades after
World War I. </p>

<hr>

<p><a href="../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm"><b>MARIJUANA TAX ACT OF
1937</b></a> </p>

<p>With the battle against opiate addiction apparently at a more
stable, less alarming level in the 1930s and the use of cocaine
having declined dramatically, a new dangerous drug appeared on
the American horizon: marijuana. Marijuana smoking arrived in the
United States with Mexican farm workers who had crossed the
border, mostly to labor in agricultural fields in the Southwest
and in sugar beet fields as far north as Montana and Michigan.
During the prosperous 1920s, about half-a-million farm workers
came to the United States, but as the Depression's widespread
unemployment laid an increasingly heavy burden on the country's
citizens, the Mexicans became an unwelcome group, encouraged in
all ways to return to Mexico. Entwined with the troubles they
were said to cause local citizens was the Mexicans' custom of
growing marijuana for their own use. Hence, marijuana was linked
to violence, dissolute living, and Mexican aliens.53 </p>

<p>The greatest fear of marijuana in the United States lay in the
West and Southwest. The government was importuned to take action,
but the recent experience with alcohol prohibition (which had
ended in 1933) made the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) and its
head, Harry J. Anslinger, formerly of the Prohibition Bureau,
hesitant to get involved in a drug that grew domestically and
prolifically. Cocaine and heroin were both foreign imports and
therefore, at least theoretically, could be regulated more
easily, but marijuana appeared to be almost impossible to curb,
let alone eradicate. The FBN tried to address this drug by
including it in a recommended uniform state narcotic law that
would leave to localities the question of prosecution and
allocation of enforcement resources. Then a curious law intended
to reduce the number of machine guns provided the federal
government with a mechanism to attack marijuana nationally and at
the federal level. </p>

<p>The Firearms Act of 1934 decreed that a machine gun could not
be transferred in any way without the payment of a transfer tax
(from which law enforcement personnel were exempted). As odd as
this mechanism may sound, the law was upheld by the Supreme Court
in 1937 as a legitimate use of the power of taxation for a moral
objective. Within weeks of this decision, the Treasury
Department, which housed the FBN, appeared before Congress asking
for a transfer tax for marijuana. Without a stamp permit and the
proper tax stamps, marijuana could not be sold, bartered, or
given away. Congress quickly approved the bill, and President
Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law later in 1937.
Unfortunately for the enforcement of this law, the FBN did not
receive any more money or agents. Therefore, the FBN relied on
obnoxious descriptions of marijuana to do the job. The substance
was described to the public as a danger at least equal to cocaine
or morphine, and the penalties for its illegal use or possession
were severe. Because use of marijuana does not seem to have been
great in the 1930s, the law's extraordinary severity did not
concern the general public until the 1960s, when thousands of
users were arrested as marijuana's popularity burgeoned.
Furthermore, the contrast between the effects of marijuana
observed in the 1960s and the longstanding claims of the FBN
regarding marijuana led to a problem concerning the credibility
of official statements, which still affects popular perceptions. </p>

<p><b>WORLD WAR II TO THE PRESENT</b> </p>

<p>The Second World War ended with relatively few opiate addicts
and very little use of cocaine or marijuana in the United States.
The only closely controlled drug rising in use was alcohol,
consumption of which had increased in per capita rates since the
repeal of Prohibition. During all this period, sleeping pills and
other barbiturates were prescribed widely but did not appear to
be a similar problem. The same holds true for the amphetamines,
which had been made available in the 1930s and continued to be
manufactured and prescribed without restriction. </p>

<p>Treatment of hard-core addicts did take place at the two
federal narcotics hospitals in Lexington, Kentucky, and Fort
Worth, Texas. Each was, in fact, a prison in which addicts were
treated and forced to detoxify, but the patients/prisoners
frequently resumed their drug habits when they returned to their
previous environments. Around 1950 a younger age group began to
be admitted for heroin addiction, an abuse that reached a very
high level in 1970 and remains high today. This threat elicited
two responses. First, the federal government enacted more severe
laws that levied mandatory sentences for conviction of dealing in
narcotics. The laws, enacted in 1951 and 1956, are the peak of
legal penalties against narcotics, including marijuana, in the
United States.55 </p>

<p>The second response reflected the domestic and international
tensions of the time. The heroin menace-and it should be
reemphasized that cocaine and marijuana were not seen as anything
but potentially major problems in the 1950s-was ascribed to the
infiltration of the drug trade by Chinese Communists who had
taken over the China mainland in 1949. The Red Chinese
purportedly sent heroin to the United States to undermine our
democracy and at the 56 same time obtain specie, for which they
had a desperate need. By the 1970s, however, the United States
was defending the People's Republic of China against the same
charge, now levied by Soviet newspapers.57 Such are the vagaries
of international relations and the domestic drug problem. </p>

<p>Heroin addicts in the 1950s mainly were young males
concentrated in black and Hispanic urban ghettos. These addicts
concerned the federal government, as well as reform-minded
lawyers, academics, and physicians. The latter groups found the
harsh penalties and the loathing attitude toward the addicts to
be inhumane. Leaders of this countermovement included sociologist
Professor Alfred Lindesmith and the attorney Rufus King. They
believed a more relaxed approach would be much more successful,
as well as more kind. Rather than depriving addicts of heroin,
heroin should be provided them. Rather than jailing addicts, they
should be hospitalized, if necessary, or just left alone.58</p>

<p>This alternative view competed with the more hard-line style
of law enforcement exemplified by Commissioner Anslinger. After
forty or more years, treating addicts medically, which had been
popular before World War I and had then been found inadequate to
the task of reducing addiction, became part of public policy in
the 1960s. Methadone, a synthetic opiate developed in Germany in
World War 11, was used by Dole and Nyswander to provide
maintenance under theories similar to those which had justified
maintenance prior to the restrictive Supreme Court decisions in
1919. This marked a major break in American narcotic control
policies; maintenance again was legal, although not with heroin
or morphine. </p>

<p>Along with the possibility of maintenance, other milder forms
of control were invoked by the federal government. Civil
commitment to a narcotic treatment center,, thought more humane
than prison sentences, became possible legally in 1966, although
in subsequent years this did not prove a practical method either
to reduce addiction or to cure addicts in any marked number.59 </p>

<p>Also in the 1960s, an enthusiasm for drug consumption of all
kinds, polydrug abuse, replaced the habitual use of one or two
drugs, which had been more common in the past. Marijuana became
very popular with young people, and then gradually its popularity
expanded in both directions to even younger and to older ages.
Psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, appeared on the scene, along with
injectable methedrine or &quot;speed.&quot; Drugs came to
symbolize opposition to the government and older mores. The
turmoil and dissension caused by the Vietnam War added to the
sense of alienation many young people already felt from the older
generation, which frowned on drug use other than alcohol and
tobacco. In addition to cultural alienation and the rapid
increase in multidrug use, the drug problem in the 1960s was
intensified by the extraordinarily large number of young people
in the ages most likely to experiment with drugs; the post-World
War 11 &quot;baby boom&quot; generation had reached the teenage
years. </p>

<p>By 1970, marijuana was used commonly, and research was showing
that it did not have the awful effects ascribed to it from the
1930s onward. Various groups and individuals initiated movements
to legalize the substance, perhaps along the lines of tobacco.
The drug situation was perceived by the public and the federal
government to be so bad and yet so difficult to control that this
seemed a good time to reevaluate the nation's entire policy. A
National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse was established
in 1971. </p>

<p>In general, the members of the commission reflected
traditional views on the subject of drug control, and therefore
it was with even greater impact that the commission recommended
in its first report, &quot;Marijuana: A Signal of
Misunderstanding,&quot; that the substance be
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; By decriminalization was not meant
legalization but a step short of that position: Marijuana
possession for individual use no longer would be a crime, but its
sale and distribution would be against the law. The purpose of
control at this stage would be to relieve law enforcement
agencies of the nuisance of arresting individual users and
thereby allow more resources to be concentrated on investigating
large-scale crime and more dangerous drugs.6o The notion of
&quot;decriminalization&quot; proved difficult for all to
understand. Some foreign nations considered it to mean
legalization. President Nixon refused to receive the report in
public or to comment on it except to affirm that marijuana was
not going to be legalized if he had anything to say about it. </p>

<p>The second and final report, published in 1973, dealt with
drugs more broadly.60 It attempted to draw attention to the
actual, measurable damage done by drugs, reflected in hospital
admissions and drug-related deaths, as opposed to the myths that
had evolved around many of them. Heroin, for example, was
misperceived as causing more deaths annually than barbiturates.
This approach intended to make more rational the discussion over
drug policy, but it also laid the groundwork for the inclusion of
cigarettes and alcohol in the antidrug crusade. It de-emphasized,
however, the effects a drug such as cocaine has on judgment and
efficiency, the less quantifiable but still real aspects of drug
use. </p>

<p>The enforcement of laws against individual possession or use
of marijuana has fallen in the United States to a very low level.
Moreover, dealers in relatively small amounts are reportedly not
prosecuted either, because the largest dealers and smugglers, who
are involved with tons, not ounces or pounds of marijuana,
require all the time of officials. There has been a de facto
decriminalization throughout large parts of the country, even if
laws against individual use remain on the books. Possession of
marijuana in some states is a small-scale misdemeanor, and the
penalty is a ticket, like a parking violation. Yet, the frequency
of marijuana use by high school seniors has been dropping since
1978, and this reduction, coupled with a more conservative
national mood, has slowed further moves toward formal federal
decriminalization or more liberality in the drug laws. </p>

<p>The rise in cocaine's availability and popularity, for the
second time this century, has further complicated the control of
drugs in the United States. The fact that first millions should
use marijuana, then millions more take cocaine raises questions
about the ability of local and national governments to control
narcotics. The corruption that follows the drug traffic and the
restraints on resources that may be allocated to drug control
combine to leave a sense of frustration with enforcement policy.
What will be the result of these trends? It all remains
uncertain. We appear to be in an era of widespread drug use that
would seem to make reasonable the revocation of antidrug
statutes. We should recall, however, that a similar condition
prevailed around 1900, shortly before an onslaught against drug
use led to a substantial reduction in the use of opiates, heroin,
cocaine, and alcohol. That such a national response could occur
must make us pause before offering predictions for the future. </p>

use of opiates to prevent painful and uncomfortable bodily and
psychic symptoms that would occur if the drug's use were abruptly
stopped. Estimates of the number of addicts in the United States
have often been susceptible to ideological and political
influences. After carefully considering contemporary surveys,
importation statistics, and other estimates, and subjecting his
findings to modern statistical analysis, Professor Courtwright
concluded that the highest rate of addiction in the United States
occurred in the 1890s at the maximum rate of 4.59 per 1,000.
Today that rate would result in 1. I million addicts, about twice
the current official estimate. </p>

be advanced against further encroachments. A good case could be
made out in favor of the prohibition of alcohol and nicotine. And
why limit the governments benevolent providence to the protection
of the individual's body only? Is is not the harm a man can
inflect on his mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily
evils? Why not prevent him from reading bad books and seeing bad
plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues and listening to
bad music? The mischief done by bad ideologies, surely, is much

<h2>William Bennett</h2>

<p> When William Bennett moved across town from the Department of
Education to be &quot;czar&quot; at the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, he brought his people with him. All white, all
male, none with law enforcement or social-service experience,
some had been with Bennett the entire eight years since his debut
at the National Endowment for the Humanities. </p>

<p> Bennett's men held themselves above the mere budget-cutters,
tax-slashers, regulation-busters, and states-rightsers that
comprised the broader executive branch. John Walters, Bennett's
chief of staff at Education and author of the punitive Schools
Without Drugs, had been to meetings of Ed Meese's Drug Policy
Board and had been appalled at their inanity. Everybody was so
busy jockeying for position that nobody ever ventured an honest
opinion or original idea. Bennett's office, on the other hand,
prided itself on being one continuous philosophy forum, with
great questions of political theory and national purpose the
stuff of daily conversation. Envisioning themselves a kind of
ideological Bennettista cavalry to the Republican infantry,
Bennett's crew saw their mission at the drug office as
fundamentally identical to that at Education or the Endowment: To
reform America's character, by force if necessary. </p>

<p> It would have been okay with them to be assigned teen
pregnancy, abortion, welfare -- any platform from which to
harangue the public about values and exact punishment for
transgression. &quot;Drugs are the hill we're fighting over at
the moment, but the war is much bigger than that,&quot; Bruce
Carnes, Bennett's budget director, would say. &quot;Our fight is
any issue that has a shade on character.&quot; </p>

<p> The &quot;hill&quot; they'd just been given to fight over,
though, wasn't just any piece of political turf, but was the
hottest hot-button issue of the decade. More than half the
country believed drugs to be the America's worst problem.
Majorities favored mandatory drug tests for all citizens,
warrantless police searches of suspected dealers' homes, and
roadblocks to search cars randomly. This wasn't mere naked
paintings or politically correct social studies textbooks. This
was a chance to preach and kick ass on the nation's brightly lit
center stage. </p>

<p> Even before Bennett's Senate confirmation, his men began
plotting their course. The same 1988 law that created the drug
czar's office also required it to produce a drug-control strategy
by September, and there was no time to waste. Bennett himself
wasn't around much. He'd checked himself into a $700-a-week
therapeutic resort to kick his two-pack-a-day cigarette habit. </p>

<p> But in the lofty and freewheeling style to which they'd
become accustomed, Bennett's core group of advisors began laying
out the assumptions on which national drug policy would hereafter
be based. </p>

<p> At this point, the United States had been fighting its War on
Drugs for twenty years. Despite the billions spent, the millions
imprisoned, and the loss of liberties to both drug user and
non-user alike, drugs were cheaper, more potent, and used by
younger children than when Nixon started the War. The drug
cartels were wealthier and more sophisticated than ever. The
number of cocaine dependents had grown. Drug violence, unheard of
at the start of the Drug War, now terrorized poor neighborhoods.
Drug combatants died daily; just the number of slain innocent
bystanders had tripled in the two years prior to Bush's
inauguration. Rather than evaluate the efficacy of the War on
Drugs and the wisdom of pursuing it, Bennett and his men merely
shuffled the deck one more time. </p>

<p> Under Nixon, heroin was the big bad drug. Halfway through
Carter's reign, marijuana nudged it aside. As the public's
passion to fight marijuana waned, cocaine was thrust forward to
draw fire. Then crack. The Drug War front shifted endlessly too,
from the border to the streets to Bolivia to the money-laundering
banks to the suburbs and back to the border again. </p>

<p> Now it was the Bennettistas' turn, and they achieved the most
radical recasting of the country's &quot;drug problem&quot; yet:
Drugs would no longer be discussed as a health problem. </p>

<p> The physical dangers of illegal drugs had always been the
Drug War's causa belli. Even the &quot;zero tolerance&quot;
policy of the late Reagan years was couched in the rhetoric of
&quot;instantaneous addiction&quot; and &quot;the poisoning of
our children&quot;: health terminology. </p>

<p> That had to stop. Because if the drug issue was going to
serve the Bennettistas' decade-long crusade to police the
nation's character, drug abuse needed to be placed in the same
category as offensive art, multicultural teaching, and ethical
relativism: a matter of morality. </p>

<p> &quot;The simple fact is that drug use is wrong,&quot;
Bennett decreed. &quot;And the moral argument, in the end, is the
most compelling argument.&quot; Terence Pell, Bennett's personal
lawyer from Education and now the drug office's chief counsel,
put it this way: &quot;We have to believe. If you think drugs are
bad, that they make people bad neighbors, horrible parents,
dangerous drivers and what have you, then you think drugs are
bad. There's a moral dimension.&quot; </p>

<p> If drugs are a health problem then addicts are
&quot;sick,&quot; and that cast them in a sympathetic light the
Bennettistas felt addicts didn't deserve. The decision to take
drugs that first time, after all, is voluntary. Walters directly
attacked the old approach. &quot;The health people say 'no
stigma,'&quot; he would say, &quot;and I'm for stigma.&quot; </p>

<p> The medical model of drug abuse was to Bennett's men a
philosophic and practical morass. If you base prohibition on
drugs' health effects, what do you say to the millions of
occasional users who convincingly claim to be uninjured by the
drugs they took? If you acknowledge that heavy drug users are
sick, you create an expectation that the government will treat
them. </p>

<p> The biggest problem with basing a prohibitive drug policy on
the health risks, though, was the invitation to comparisons. The
year the chain-smoking Bennett became drug czar, tobacco killed
some 395,000 Americans -- more than died in both world wars.
Alcohol directly killed 23,000 and another 22,400 on the
highways. The Natural Resources Defense Council in March
published a report, widely praised by medical authorities,
estimating that as many as 5,500 Americans would develop cancer
from the pesticides they ate during their preschool years. The
incidence of breast cancer in American women had more than
doubled since World War II, owing largely to dioxin and other
pollutants. Cocaine, on the other hand, killed 3,308 people that
year, slightly less than died from anterior horn cell disease.
Heroin and other opiates killed 2,743. And no death from
marijuana has ever been recorded. </p>

<p> Drugs damage without killing, of course, but even here other
preventable health problems put illegal drugs in deep shade. The
General Accounting Office, Congress's non-partisan investigative
agency, estimated that some 350,000 people were using cocaine
daily in 1989. While that's a big number, 15 times that many
children were going to bed hungry at least once a month that
year, 50 times that many Americans were sleeping on the streets,
and 100 times that many had no health insurance. </p>

<p> Discussing drugs as a moral problem obviated such
comparisons. If the case could be made that drug use is simply
wrong, then it wouldn't matter that some people use drugs safely,
that alcohol and tobacco kill more people than reefer and smack,
that more American than European children know hunger. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas worked hard to address the inconsistencies
of their approach. Their most glaring problem was the new drug
czar himself. By any medical definition, Bennett was a drug
addict, so dependent on nicotine after giving up the drug in its
smokable form that he now carried everywhere a pack of nicotine
chewing gum and was up to 40 milligrams of nicotine a day --
about as much as in two packs of cigarettes. </p>

<p> Alcohol was another problem. Bennett's drug office had no
Congressional mandate to address it, his mainstream constituency
enjoyed it, and the alcohol industry's mulitmillion-dollar lobby
wouldn't stand for further restrictions on booze. So the drug
office needed somehow to place alcohol on the &quot;moral&quot;
side of the line. No small trick. Aside from the cirrhosis and
highway deaths, booze was implicated in violent crime to a much
greater degree than any illegal drug. The Justice Department
found that half of those convicted of homicide in 1989 were using
alcohol at the time of the killing, while fewer than six percent
said they were on drugs alone. </p>

<p> Bennett's men tiptoed through the minefield of alcohol and
tobacco. John Walters took the position that marijuana, cocaine,
and heroin, &quot;enslave people&quot; and &quot;prevent them
from being free citizens&quot; in a way that alcohol and tobacco
do not. Bruce Carnes decided that drug taking was
&quot;life-denying,&quot; and &quot;inward,&quot; but that
alcohol and tobacco were not. Illegal drugs, Bennett said in a
speech that May, &quot;obliterate morals, value, character, our
relations with each other and our relation to God.&quot; None of
these conclusions was based on science, but collectively they had
the effect of royal fiat. </p>

<p> The Bennettistas also relied on a neat bit of tautology:
marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are immoral because they are
illegal. Why are they illegal? Because they are immoral.
Compliance, not health, was the real issue. &quot;Now that the
government has spoken to the subject that drugs are
unlawful,&quot; said Paul McNulty, a Bennettista soul-mate
directing communications at the Justice Department, &quot;a
person who disobeys the law has made a moral choice and should be
dealt with appropriately.&quot; Bennett freely admitted drug
enforcement was but an instrument of a wider agenda, calling for
&quot;the reconstitution of legal and social authority through
the imposition of appropriate consequences for drug dealing and
drug use.&quot; &quot;The drug crisis,&quot; he told the
Washington Hebrew congregation, &quot;is a crisis of authority,
in every sense of the term, 'authority.&quot; </p>

<p> Consequently, &quot;a massive wave of arrests is a top
priority for the War on Drugs,&quot; Bennett announced.
Washington, D.C. had arrested 45,000 of its citizens for drugs in
the two years prior to Bennett's appointment, &quot;without
making an appreciable dent in either the drug trade or the murder
rate,&quot; Newsweek noted. But Bennett wanted more of the same.
On the day he was sworn in, he declared the city a &quot;high
intensity drug trafficking area&quot; and unveiled a massive plan
to fight drugs in the nation's capital. More than eighty federal
agents would bolster the city's drug squad. A curfew would sweep
the streets of minors after 11 p.m. A judge ruled the curfew
unconstitutional, but the mood was infectious. Some members of
Congress suggested declaring de facto martial law -- placing the
D.C. police under federal control and sending in the Army and
National Guard. Of the $100 million Bennett wanted spent in D.C.,
95 percent was for law enforcement. Of that, more than half would
go to a new prison, and until that could be built, Bennett
proposed converting abandoned military buildings into makeshift
drug prisons. As for the purpose of all this new incarceration,
Bennett was characteristically blunt: &quot;I'm not a person who
says that the first purpose of punishment is
rehabilitation,&quot; he told Congress. &quot;The first purpose
is moral, to exact a price for transgressing the rights of
others.&quot; </p>

<h2>Elvis Presley</h2>

<p> The year ended on an odd note for the War on Drugs. Four days
before Christmas 1971, Egil Krogh's phone rang. It was Dwight
Chapin, from Bob Haldeman's staff. </p>

<p> &quot;The King is here,&quot; Chapin said. </p>

<p> &quot;King who?&quot; Krogh asked. &quot;No kings on the
president's schedule today.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Not just any two-bit king,&quot; Chapin answered.
&quot;The King. Elvis. The King of Rock.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis Presley had appeared that morning at the Northwest Gate
of the White House and handed the guard a nearly illegible
six-page letter on American Airlines stationery. He was an
admirer of the president, Presley wrote, and he wanted to help
spread Nixon's anti-drug message. He was well positioned, too:.
&quot;The drug culture, the hippie elements, the SDS, Black
Panthers, etc. do not consider me as their enemy or as they call
it The Establishment.&quot; To dispel any doubts as to his own
loyalty, Presley added in bold underline, &quot;I call it America
and I love it!&quot; </p>

<p> Then Presley made his pitch. &quot;I can and will do more
good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large. . . . All I need is
the Federal credentials.&quot; </p>

<p> Presley was registered at a nearby hotel under the name Jon
Burrows. &quot;I will be here for as long as it takes to get the
credentials of a Federal Agent,&quot; Presley wrote. &quot;I have
done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing
techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where
I can and will do the most good.&quot; </p>

<p> Though he didn't mention it in the note to Nixon, Presley was
a collector of police badges. And he was a dopehound of legendary
excess. But in the squareball Nixon White House, Presley found
perhaps the only people in the United States who didn't know
that. Krogh certainly didn't. He took the letter at face value. </p>

<p> At 12:30, the King was relieved of his present for the chief
executive - a nickel-plated .45 automatic, complete with
ammunition -- and ushered into the office of the president. </p>

<p> Nixon was dressed like Nixon: blue suit, white shirt, tie.
Elvis was dressed like Elvis: black velvet jacket, chest hair,
gold medallions, sunglasses and a belt buckle big as a dinner
plate. He pulled up a sleeve to exhibit cufflinks the size of
hamsters. As Nixon bent close to examine them, Elvis launched
into a tirade against the Beatles, who he accused of being
anti-American. </p>

<p> &quot;You know,&quot; Nixon said. &quot;Those who use the
drugs are the protesters. You know, the ones who get caught up in
dissent and violence. They're the same group of young
people.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;Mr. President,&quot; Elvis said, &quot;I'm on your
side. I want to be helpful. And I want to help get people to
respect the flag because that's getting lost.&quot; </p>

<p> Then Elvis got to the point. &quot;Mr. President, can you get
me a badge from the Narcotics Bureau?&quot; </p>

<p> Krogh was afraid of this. He'd already called the number-two
man at BNDD who earlier that day had thrown Elvis out. Elvis had
gone there before stopping at the Northwest gate, and offered a
$5,000 &quot;donation&quot; to BNDD in return for a badge. </p>

<p> Nixon, not knowing any of that, looked uncertainly at Krogh.
&quot;Bud, can we get him a badge?&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;If you want to give him a badge, I think we can get him
one.&quot; </p>

<p> &quot;I'd like to do that. See that he gets one.&quot; </p>

<p> Elvis then did something nobody had ever done in the Nixon
Oval Office; he gathered the president up in his arms and gave
him a big bear hug. The staff was stunned; the photographer
didn't even get a picture. Nixon endured it stiffly, handed out
presidential tie clasps, and dismissed the King with a hearty pat
on the shoulder. </p>

<p> And so it came to pass that on the day Elvis Presley died of
a drug overdose in 1977, he was a credentialed Special Assistant
in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. </p>

        killer for injured soldiers during the Civil War. Opiates
        were the first real miracle drugs because they allowed
        the patient to be anesthetized while the doctor performed
        surgery. Before the advent of opiates, the most common
        surgery was a simple amputation. That is, the doctor got
        several big strong people to hold the patient down and
        then literally sawed off an arm or a leg while the
        patient screamed in pain. For this reason, a good doctor
        was a fast doctor. Battlefield hospitals during the Civil
        War commonly had large piles of severed arms and legs.
        The use of opiates as anesthesia gave doctors time to
        work on the patient and actually made modern surgery
        possible. </td>

        was not outlawed and remained available in any number of

        outlawed, because that was a peculiarly Chinese habit and
        the laws were specifically directed at the Chinese. The
        white people in the communities feared that Chinese men
        were luring white women to have sex in opium dens. <hr>
        <p>The patent medicine industry started its rise. Because
        there were no restrictions on advertising, labeling, or
        contents of any products the patent medicine industry
        made up all sorts of concoctions including the opiates,
        cocaine, and other drugs, and sold them with the most
        extravagant advertising claims. This led to a rise in
        addiction.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>SOLDIER'S DISEASE AND ADDICTION IN THE
CIVIL WAR <br>
</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Abstract<br>
</b></p>

<p>Soldier's Disease -- widespread addiction following massive
administration of opiates during the Civil War -- is the earliest
and most often repeated example of a drug problem before the
narcotics laws. The story exemplifies several basic themes used
in support of continued drug prohibition -- addiction is easy to
acquire, hard to kick, and is a publicly noticed, i.e. <i>asocial,
</i>problem. Soldier's Disease, though, is a myth. Not one case
of addiction was reported in medical records or the literature of
the time; under ten references were made in the Nineteenth
Century to addiction the cause of which was the Civil War; and no
perjorative nickname for addicted veterans, like Soldier's
Disease, appeared in the literature until 1 9 15, and it did not
become part of the Conventional Wisdom of drug experts until
almost a century after Appomattox. </p>

<p align="center"><b>THE MYTHICAL ROOTS OF U.S. DRUG POLICY:</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>SOLDIER'S DISEASE AND ADDICTS IN THE CIVIL
WAR<br>
</b></p>

<p><b>myth ... 1: </b>a usu. traditional story of ostensibly
historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of
a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomena ... <b>3
... b: </b>an ill-founded belief held uncritically esp. by an
interested group.<br>
</p>

<p>Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, 1973<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest (and often the only) example of opiate addiction
as a social problem which is frequently cited by drug experts is <b>Soldier's
Disease -- </b>widespread addiction resulting from widespread
opiate use in the Civil War. Most writers who report Soldier's
Disease devote no more than three sentences to it. It is the
brevity, clarity, &quot;catchiness,&quot; and conceptual
implication of &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; which accounts for
the contemporary significance of such a fleeting reference.
Possibly the lengthiest and most graphic description of opiate
use in the Civil War, resulting in massive addiction among
veterans, was provided by Gerald Starkey, a century after that
war: </p>

<p><i>In 1862 (sic) the Civil War broke out.... They would charge
each other, literally pound chains down cannons and fire point
blank at the enemy and these young men were presented to their
field surgeons with terrible shrapnel wounds ... along with
terrible pain.</i> </p>

<p><i>About all the field surgeon could do was use the two new
invented tools that had been presented to him in the previous
five or six years I the hypodermic needle and syringe, along with
Morphine Sulfate .... They injected the young wounded veterans
with huge amounts of Morphine daily (every four hours) to kill
their pain.... It was necessary for the surgeons to do
full-quarter amputations -- literally take the arms and legs off
right at the start of the body, usually to stop infectious
gangrene.</i> </p>

<p><i>In 1865 there were an estimated 400,000 young War veterans
addicted to Morphine.... The returning veteran could be. .
identified because he had a leather thong around his neck and a
leather bag (with) Morphine Sulfate tablets, along with a syringe
and a needle issued to the soldier on his discharge.... (T)his
was called the &quot;Soldier's Disease.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>(Starkey, 1971:482-84)1 </p>

<p>The lesson to be learned from &quot;Soldier's Disease&quot;
involves four linked hypotheses, phrased as fact, which form a
paradigm justifying today's U.S. Drug policy. This paradigm is:<br>
</p>

<p>Free access to opiates sooner or later breeds a massive use of
opiates. </p>

<p>Widespread use of opiates leads to a lot of addicts. </p>

<p>Addiction is long-term, often enough, forever. </p>

<p>Addiction is a publicly manifest problem.<br>
</p>

<p>In sum, free availability leads to a social problem.<br>
</p>

<p>The historical record shows, however, that Soldier's Disease
is a fanciful reconstruction of the past by writers I 00 years or
more after the Civil War. There was not, to my knowledge, a
single mention of Soldier's Disease, Army Disease, or any other
sobriquet referring to addicted veterans, until a half -century
after the Civil War; not one addict was noted in any writing or
statistic compiled during or immediately after the Civil War; and
reports of addicted veterans who began using during that War are
only rarely mentioned throughout the rest of the 19th Century.<br>
</p>

<p>Soldier's Disease is a modern creation that has very little to
do with the facts of 19th Century drug use. Rather, it is an idea
which fits, which shores up, modern drug policies. It is an
assertion about what opiates are supposed to do, applied to a
past situation. <br>
</p>

<p>In the next part -- Section I -- of this paper, the relevance
of Soldier's Disease to contemporary drug policy is addressed.
Soldier's Disease is the only tale of a pre-Harrison Act opiate
problem which a self-respecting scholar in recent years could
point to as a pre-1914 social problem due to opiates. In Section
2, the modern creation of Soldier's Disease, and its recent
popularity among drug experts, is shown by noting the first who
mention the concept and when, a generation or two later, it
became accepted by scholars of all persuasions. Then the focus
turns to the historical evidence which would test, in order, the
four steps in the above paradigm. In Section 3 the questions are:
&quot;were opiates widely used by soldiers during the Civil
War?&quot; and &quot;was addiction among them widespread <i>during
</i>the war?&quot; In Section 4 the questions are: &quot;was
there wide-scale addiction among veterans <i>after </i>the
war?&quot; and &quot;was this a publicly manifest problem?&quot;
What follows is the evidence for answering these four questions:
in order, &quot; a tentative yes...... no,&quot; &quot;no,&quot;
and &quot;no.&quot; The conclusions will expand further on how
the mythic and the actual situation of Civil War opiate use
relates to the current Drug policy debate. </p>

<p align="center">1. <b><u>The Relevance of Soldier's Disease</u></b>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>To Contemporary U.S. Drug Policy</u></b> </p>

<p>The paradigm justifying U.S. opiate policy -- availability
leads to use; use leads to addiction; addiction is long-term; and
addiction becomes a publicly manifest problem -- conveys the idea
that unavoidable <b>Social </b><i>consequences </i>of free access
to opiates justify the enormous costs of contemporary U.S. drug
policy. Of all the stories about the &quot;bad old days&quot;
when opiates were legal, only Soldier's Disease provides
convincing </p>

<p>I. evidence&quot; that opiate availability led to a publicly
manifest problem, beyond merely a substantial increase in the
numbers of addicts. Thus, only the tale of Soldier's Disease
demonstrates Step 4 of the paradigm. The very phrase
&quot;Soldier's Disease&quot; connotes a publicly manifest
problem. Otherwise, the tales told about opiates before the laws
banning them were either too far-fetched to be repeated in modern
times, or reflect a social problem only if you believe the
paradigm, (and often not even then). During and just before 1914,
the type of stories carried by the press about opiates did not
indicate a social problem which might lead to a need for
prohibition, and the absence of media coverage of the Harrison
Act during the year it was passed by Congress further suggests
the irrelevance of opiate use to a social problem. </p>

<p>There were, in the medical as well as the mass media of the
late 19th and early 20th Centuries, occasional alarms sounded
about other publicly manifest opiate problems, but no scholar in
recent years believes that these were real or significant. (For
example, the press periodically reported an opium problem,
particularly white women smoking opium in Chinatown, with Chinese
men. A racist, not an opiate problem). Even the moralistic
anti-opium writers of about a century ago, with rare and often
unbelievable exceptions, did not point to a publicly noticed
problem.2<br>
</p>

<p>Today, there are <i>imputed </i>social problems, but not a <i>demonstrated
</i>one, beyond Soldier's Disease. Historians David Musto and
David Courtwright (Musto, 1972:2-4; and Courtwright, 1982:16-28)
extend a tradition3 of research into the megatonnage of opiates
annually imported into the U.S. from well before the Civil War
through the early 20th Century. Additionally, opiates were
typically a key ingredient in patent medicines, and there was a
huge national campaign against them resulting in the Pure Food
and Drug Act. Neither the level of imports nor the widespread use
of opiates in patent medicines, in the absence of belief in a
paradigm such as we noted, suggest anything beyond widespread
availability. <br>
</p>

<p>The medical literature of the 19th Century is filled with
discussions about opiates, many written by experts who believed
its use was terrible. To them, a loss of &quot;moral will,&quot;
perhaps best exemplified by secretiveness, including husbands and
wives keeping large scale addictions hidden from their spouses
for many years,4 was a major problem. Addicts were deemed liars,
which was only natural given the opprobrium attached to addiction
in much of U.S. society long before there were drug laws.<b> </b>The
medical and pharmaceutical literature also had an on-going
contest, essentially, to report the oldest, most long-time,
addict with the largest habit. None of the above indicates that
the behavior of 19th or early 20th Century addicts was a publicly
evident problem. </p>

<p>In the years just before national drug prohibition, there was
barely a sign of an opiate-caused social problem, Two newspapers,
to my knowledge, were indexed for 1906-1912 -- the New York Times
and the San Francisco Call.5 In each, there were three basic
types of stories: recent state laws<u> </u>which were forerunners
of the Harrison Act in that they criminalized opiate use; arrests
(over half being of Chinese Americans); and international
stories. Opiates are assumed to be &quot;evil&quot; but the only
allusion to a possible social consequence in any Times story is
headlined &quot;Says Opium Aids Music Composers.-6 The only
public problem with opiates recounted in the Call, besides white
women in Chinese opiate dens7 and problems which result from the
local laws, is lethargy among the troops at The Presidio.
(&quot;It destroys the vitality of the user, and would in time
make the soldier a useless charge.&quot;) (S.F. Call, 1910b) 8 </p>

<p>The year the nation's major opiate prohibition law was passed,
the mass media, (at least the New York Times, San Francisco
Chronicle, Washington Post, and the Hearst Press), gave virtually
no coverage to Congressional discussion or passage of the
Harrison Act, or when it was signed into law or took effect.
(Aldrich, 1979) Fourteen months after it was signed, a medical
journal presented the results of a one-question survey -&quot;In
your opinion what are the five most useful and important drugs in
the materia medica?&quot; -- answered by teachers at leading
medical schools. &quot;Not only did it (opium) receive 102 votes
out of 107, but in 60 instances it was named first.&quot;
(Robinson, 1916) </p>

<p>What the above suggests is not only that the rationales to
justify opiate prohibition circa 1914 could not be repeated by
self-respecting <i>scholars </i>as rationales for continued
prohibition today, but that hardly a rationale was offered at
all. The Harrison Act crept in on tip-toes, called a tax act,
with no fanfare, no public interest or debate. When, a few years
later, it became clear that this was a criminal law with
considerable consequences, there was a brief flurry of criticism
and a rationale provided for continuing opiate prohibition,
namely the vileness and criminality of &quot;junkies&quot; and
the criminal cartels supplying them. Obviously, the consequences
of the law provided the rationale for justifying the law, but
there were not that many opiate addicts and it was not that big a
social problem for the debate to continue. </p>

<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; of a social problem is needed to justify
opiate prohibition only when such prohibition is a significant
social issue (which it was not in the years preceding the
Harrison Act) and when criticism of drug laws crescendoes. Only
then do scholars reconsider the rationales for the drug laws, and
turn to the historical record for insights into contemporary
concerns. It is only in these periods when the four parts of the
paradigm, enunciated above, have to be demonstrated if
contemporary drug policy is to be accepted. It is the final step
-- the manifestation of a problem, in public -- which makes the
other three socially significant. The only currently cited
example of the complete paradigm, in the absence of opiate
prohibition, is Soldier's Disease ... and it's a myth.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p><b>2. </b><u>Tracking The Develogment of The MM<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>It's Roots</u> </p>

<p>The earliest portrayal of Soldier's Disease among Civil War
veterans appeared as World War I erupted over Europe (also the
year the Harrison Act, took effect). In &quot;The Curse of
Narcotism in America -- A Reveille,&quot; Marks, a Yale
professor, intended to alert the U.S. to an enormous addiction
problem among Civil War veterans that would be replicated in
another war: </p>

<p>Did you know that there is practically no old American family
of Civil War reputation which has not had its addicts?.... (I)t
was the &quot;army disease&quot; because of its prevalence?....
(W)ith the war that hangs over us, the drug evil will spread into
a giantism of even more terrible growth than the present?....
(T)here are something like 4,000,000 victims of opium and cocaine
in this country today? </p>

<p>(Marks, 1915:315)9 </p>

<p>Marks feared the return of the &quot;hydra-headed
drug-curse&quot; of the Civil War, but others writing during
World War I about the consequences of combat upon drug use among
servicemen made no reference to the War Between the States.
(Crothers, 1916; N.Y. Times, 1917; Stanley, 1918; and Weber,
1918)<br>
</p>

<p>In the nine years after World War I, a handful of authors
mentioned Civil War-related addiction, though none mentioned Army
Disease or any such synonym. (Bishop, 1919 and 1920; Illinois
Medical journal, 192 1; World's Work, 1924; and Fell, 1924).<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Army Disease&quot; was next noted in <u>The Opium
Problem</u>. Terry and Pellens' encyclopedic work of 1928, which
became &quot;regarded as the single most comprehensive work in
the field&quot; only several decades later.10 (Ball, 1970) For
Terry and Pellens, &quot;the Civil War gave it (chronic opium
intoxication) a considerable impetus (which) seems definitely
established.&quot; (Terry and Pellens, 1928: 5) Between 1928 and
the late 1950's, only a handful of scholars noted &quot;Army
Disease&quot; (Terry, 193 1; Woods, 193 1: Dai, 1937: Barnes,
1939; and Lindesmith, 1947), and even in the early 1960's it was
infrequently mentioned (Isbell, 1960 and 1963; Kolb, 1960 and
1962; Clausen, 196 1; Maurer and Vogel, 1962; and Sonnedecker,
1963), though prior to the drug explosion of the mid- 1960's
there were few scholars in the drug field. For the experts who
the past quarter century have claimed Soldier's Disease, if they
cite any reference it is typically Terry and Pellens. </p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>The Contemporary Conventional Wisdom<br>
</u></p>

<p>Since 1964, Soldier's Disease, in essence, was mentioned in
about 100 works by drug experts, half of these since 1973.11 It
was also mentioned in several studies by prestigious government
agencies and Drug and Crime Commissions.12 Among the experts are
many renowned critics of U.S. drug policies -- including Edward
Brecher, Alan Dershowitz, John Kaplan, Arnold Trebach and Norman
Zinberg. In the early 1970's a few writers questioned the
factuality of Soldier's (Kramer, 1971 and 1972; Swatos, 1972;
Musto, 1973; and Quinones, 1975), but shortly thereafter they
were rebutted in a detailed historical analysis. (Courtwright,
1978 and 1982)13 Since the mid- 1970's the mention of Soldier's
Disease has diminished, maybe because the critics had an impact
or because most experts stopped probing the roots of U.S. drug
policy after the early 1970's. <br>
</p>

<p>Soldiers Disease is, however, still mentioned by many experts
... and no one, yet, has responded to Courtwright. </p>

<p>Though briefly stated, a consistent theme involving three
components is reiterated by almost all the cited drug experts,
the only variation being in the synonyms used. First, morphine in
particular, and opiates in general, were administered by naive
doctors &quot;indiscriminately&quot; (also termed &quot;
promiscuous&quot;, &quot;imprudent&quot;,
&quot;uncontrolled&quot;, &quot;overdosage&quot;,
&quot;ignorant&quot;, etc.). Second, as a consequence of such
medical naivete, addiction among soldiers was massive (also
termed &quot;prevalent&quot;, &quot;commonplace&quot;,
&quot;thousands&quot;, wholesale usage&quot;,
&quot;rampant&quot;, etc.). Third, so widespread was the
addiction among soldiers and veterans that it became known as
Soldier's Disease (also termed &quot;army disease&quot;,
&quot;soldier's illness&quot;, or &quot;soldier's
sickness.&quot;),14 </p>

<p>The only clear disagreement is the few who estimate the number
of addicted Civil War veterans. Some claim 45,000 (Ashley, 1972
and 1978; Geis, 1973; Health PAC, 1970; and Kenny, 1972); others
400,000. (H. Jones and Jones, 1977; Lingeman, 1969; Schwartz,
1980; Starkey, 197 1; Summers et. al., 1975; and Westin and
Shaffer, 1972) Since no writer in either camp provides one clue
for their claim, the possibility that both estimates arose out of
the thin air circa 1970 is not ruled out. </p>

<p>Is today's conventional wisdom about Soldier's Disease an
intellectual version of the children's game of Telephone where a
simple message, after innumerable repetitions, becomes distorted
and a new &quot;catchy&quot; message takes on a life of its own
... or have recent writers captured the essence of opiate
addiction in a past era? That depends on the evidence during and
just after the Civil War.<br>
</p>

<p><b>3. </b><u>Opiate Use and Addiction During The Civil War<br>
</u></p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>The Need For and Use Of Opiates</u> </p>

<p>During the Civil War, and at least until 1914, opiates were
considered the best medicine for controlling dysentery and
diarrhea and for containing the pain from war wounds. The Surgeon
General's history of the just ended Civil War was often lavish in
its praise of opium. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Opium -- </i>this medicine merits first place among
these remedies. It was used almost universally in all cases of
severe wounds, and was particularly useful in penetrating wounds
of the chest, in quieting the nervous system and, indirectly in
moderating hemmorhage. </p>

<p>(US Surgeon General, 1870 :645) </p>

<p>But, how great was the need? How widely was it used? Given the
need, and the use, of opiates then, how many soldier addicts were
there in the Civil War?<br>
</p>

<p>Official records from the Civil War show more incidents of
severe <u>illness</u> for which opiates were the main remedy than
there were <u>wounds</u>. More died from disease than were killed
in battle or succumbed to wounds (For Union troops, 62%
&quot;disease,&quot; 19% &quot;battle,&quot; and 12%
&quot;Wounds&quot; of 360,000 deaths among Union troops).
(Duncan, 1912:397) Union medical records (for medical problems,
not deaths) show approximately 1,400,000 acute and 200,000
chronic cases of diarrhea or dysentery, 250,000 wounds, and
300,000 cases, combined, of typhoid, typhus, continued fever,
venereal disease, scurvy, delerium tremens, insanity and
paralysis. (Brooks, 1966:127) There were 30,000 amputations
reported performed by the Union's doctors. (US Surgeon General,
1883) Among Confederate prisoners, 32% of the almost 19,000 who
died in captivity in the north succumbed to diarrhea or
dysentery. (Brooks, 1966:126) In Andersonville prison from
February 1864 to April 1865, of 12,541 recorded Union soldier
captives who died, 45% did so from diarrhea or dysentery, and
only 7% from wounds, gangrene or &quot;debility.&quot; (US
Surgeon General, 1879:32) There was obviously a great <u>need</u>
for opiates. </p>

<p>Civil War physicians frequently dispensed opiates. The
Secretary of War just after 1865 stated the Union Army was issued
10 million opium pills, over 2,840,000 ounces of other opiate
preparations (such as laudunum or paregoric which, by weight,
were well under half opium), and almost 30,000 ounces of morphine
sulphate. (Courtwright, 1978:106-7 and 1982) <br>
</p>

<p><b>B. </b><u>Not One Report of Addiction In The Field<br>
</u></p>

<p>Yet for all the quantities dispensed, <i><u>there was not one
report from 1861-1865 of an addicted soldier.</u></i> </p>

<p>Could opiate addiction pass unnoticed, and have no
consequences, among troops living in raw conditions and often
moving from one place to another? Could so much morphine and
opium preparations get used without generating a single addict?<br>
</p>

<p>The 30,000 ounces of morphine is most easily explained.
Probably, most of it was <b><i>dusted </i></b>or <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into
wounds or, during anesthetization, <b><i>rubbed </i></b>into raw
tissue. (Adams, 1952; and Brooks, 1966) In the campaign of
Fredericksburg in December of 1862, &quot;hypodermic syringes
were unknown, such drugs as morphine being doled out on the point
of a knife&quot; by surgeons. (Duncan, 1985: 200) By the end of
the war, the hypodermic needle was beginning to be used, in
places -- &quot;roughly 19 per cent of Union Army physicians were
capable of administering morphine hypodermically.... and even
fewer Confederate physicians were (so) capable.&quot;
(Courtwright, 1978:105) Whether the hypodermic administration of
morphine during the Civil War was extremely rare as some have
claimed (US Surgeon General, 1888:547) or as others have implied
by their failure to note such use in medical histories of the war
(Courtwright, 1978:104-105), or was frequent as one neurologist
noted (Courtwright, 1978:106), there is not one case mentioned
where morphine was injected for pleasure, or to stave off
withdrawal pains. </p>

<p>The Civil War lasted four years, with 1,500,000 three year
enlistments on the Union side. Thus, those ten million opium
pills dispensed by Union doctors average roughly two per soldier
per year (assuming the pills survived combat conditions). Prior
to amputations or other battlefield surgery, the patient
routinely expected and was routinely given one of these pills.
Similarly, the 2,84 1,000 ounces of opiate preparations works out
to about a half -ounce per Union soldier per year. Though
physicians argued about the benefits of opiates for the relief of
pain which accompanied &quot;the fluxes&quot; (diarrhea and
dysentery), &quot;the partisans of opium were very much in the
majority&quot; and used opium for dysentery and other forms of
flux including &quot;chronic fluxes.&quot; Army physicians
&quot;united opium with almost every medicine employed to check
the progress of the disease,&quot; and despite typical failure to
cure returned &quot;almost always to opium as the drug which at
least alleviated, if it did not cure.&quot; Where the sufferings
of the patient were very great and continuous, and where
sleeplessness and restlessness had become a medical danger,
opiates were highly recommended, even by the otherwise skeptical
physician. (US Surgeon General, 1879: 743-747) Again, applying
basic arithmetic, and taking into account that there were many
more than the <i>reported </i>1.6 million cases of dysentery and
diarrhea, it is easy to understand why there were periodic
shortages of opiates. As with morphine, there is not a single
report during the Civil War of a soldier rising opium for
pleasure, and the single claim of opiates used to stave off
withdrawal pains (published 16 years after the War) was the
&quot;confession&quot; of an officer charged with &quot;deserting
in the face of the enemy, and sentenced to be shot.&quot;15
(Nolan, 1881) </p>

<p>Though modern writers have accused the military doctors in the
Civil War of not fully appreciating the addictive qualities of
opiates, one historian of Civil War medicine writes that
physicians in the field did not fully appreciate the benefits of
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>Tincture of opium and paregoric were always available, but
nowhere in the records does one get the impression that they were
used routinely in the management of the fluxes. </p>

<p align="center">(Brooks, 1966:117) <br>
</p>

<p>Morphine, too, may well have been underused, to judge from a
leading, albeit unusual, neurologist at the time, S. Weir
Mitchell, who: </p>

<p>(S)colded the medical profession for its reluctance in using
this mighty painkiller, pointing out that some patients' agonies
were so severe the choice must lie between Morphine and
amputation. </p>

<p>(Adams, 1952:138)<br>
</p>

<p>The naivete of military physicians regarding the negative
effects of opiates, often noted shortly after the Civil War, had
to do basically with their misunderstanding the medical effects
of opiates, not the addictive properties of the drug.16 (US
Surgeon General, 1879:735-750) </p>

<p>There were no reports of addiction in situations which, a
century or so later, generated numerous such references. For the
Civil War, one virtually never reads of a soldier suffering
withdrawal pains, or dying of an OD; or a physician in the field
besieged for an opiate for feeding a habit (as distinct from
easing pain or controlling diarrhea). In Wait Whitman's
description of the 80,000 to 100,000 sick and wounded he saw in
600 hospital visits during three years of the Civil War, he notes
that many patients craved tobacco, sweets, or alcohol, yet he
never once mentions opium. (Whitman, 1895) The sickness form
submitted by physicians to the Surgeon General from mid- 1 862 to
the end of the war listed 152 categories of disease, including
&quot;serpent bite,&quot; &quot;apoplexy,&quot;
&quot;insanity,&quot; &quot;night blindness,&quot;
&quot;poisoning,&quot; &quot;inebriation,&quot; &quot;delirium
tremens&quot; and &quot;chronic alcoholism&quot;, but not
addiction or opiate deprivation. (US Surgeon General, Pt. 1, V.
1). In the Surgeon General's history of the Civil War,
&quot;nostalgia ... .army itch .... poisoning .... alcoholism
.... and venereal disease,&quot; but not opiate use, are singled
out for special comment. Under &quot;nostalgia&quot; the problem
of boredom is given prominence and smoking tobacco, drinking
alcohol, and gambling are singled out for their &quot;sedative
influence,&quot; to &quot;pass the dull hours&quot; in lieu of
satisfying the craving for excitement. (US Surgeon General, 1888:
886) In sum, there is no hard evidence of addicts during the
Civil War, and it is hard to believe it would have been missed
had addiction been significant.<br>
</p>

<p><u>C. Not One Report of Addiction Immediately After The Civil
War</u> </p>

<p>If addiction among Civil War veterans was significant, it
should have been most noticed in the immediate post-War years.
There were 63,000 soldiers whose chronic diarrhea carried on
after the war, (Adams, 1889) and over 20,000 survivors of
amputations reported by Union doctors. (US Surgeon General, 1883)
When the Civil War ended, and veterans filled the prisons, New
York State prison keepers at Auburn and Sing-Sing told of
contraband smuggled into prisons, such as &quot;whiskey,
tobacco... yellow covered literature.... sugar, tea, coffee,
butter, pies, cakes, liquor, looking glasses, combs, brushes,
etc.&quot;, yet opiates were not mentioned. (North American
Review, 1867:572-74) In the Mississippi State Hospital, whose
admission records of the mentally ill go back to 1855, the first
narcotism case was recorded in 1884. (Jaquith, 1965) The edition
of the United States Dispensatory, (the enormous physician's desk
reference of the time), which appeared just after the Civil War
devotes 27 pages to &quot;opium&quot; without noting the Civil
War. (Wood and Bache, 1868) Surely a significant minority of
those 63,000 diarrhetics and 30,000 amputees were advised to take
opiates by their physicians, and willingly took what at the time
was the best relief of their problems. Yet only two references to
veterans who began using opiates during the Civil War were
published before 1880. (Day, 1868; and Oliver, 1872) (A third
pre-1880 case-history of an addicted veteran, cited by some as
demonstrating Soldier's Disease, started using opiates after the
war). (Anon, 1876) </p>

<p><b>D. </b><u>The Logic For Claiming The Existence of Many
Civil War Addicts</u> </p>

<p>How, then, could recent experts agree on massive addiction
during the Civil War? Almost certainly it has to do with trust in
the statements of Terry and Pellens without bothering to check
the original sources. The one exception -- the one historian who
has checked those sources and maintains the validity of addiction
during the Civil War -- is Courtwright, who believes that
addiction must exist ... even though it is not in evidence. For
morphine, Courtwright cites S. Weir Mitchell's claim that 40,000
morphine injections were given at one army hospital in one year.
This number is far beyond any other -- in fact, except for it
there would be no consideration of the <i>widespread </i>use of
morphine other than what was rubbed and dusted into wounds.
Courtwright considers the claim &quot;puzzling, to say the
least,&quot; (and there are reasons for doubting Weir,
personally),17 but he concludes if that number &quot;is even half
correct, it seems impossible that a substantial portion of the
patients ... did not end the war as addicts.&quot;
&quot;Impossible&quot; as it seems, not a single addict was
reported during the Civil War. </p>

<p>Courtwright also notes &quot;the frequency and casualness with
which opiates were administered&quot; and states that &quot;vast
quantities of opium preparations other than morphine were
dispensed under circumstances (such as to those with chronic
diarrhea, dysentery or malaria) which could very easily lead to
addiction.&quot; The only trouble is &quot;very easily&quot; did
not occur. </p>

<p>Disregarding the lack of documentation on a single addict
during the Civil War, Courtwright contends &quot;that the war
contributed to the spread of addiction,&quot; and <b><i>&quot;</i></b>offer<b><i>
</i></b>the fighting, sick and wounded veterans greatly expanded
the pool for iatrogenic addiction.&quot; (Courtwright,
1982:55-56, emphasis added) Since opiates were widely
administered in the early as well as last years of the Civil War,
<b>it </b>is hard to imagine why addiction would only develop
after the war. Nonetheless, accepting Courtwright's contention
for the moment, the test of the validity of Soldier's Disease
thus depends on analysis of post-war addiction among veterans.<br>
</p>

<p><b>4. </b><u>Reports of Addicted Veterans Through the 19th
Century <br>
</u></p>

<p>Were it not for Horatio Day's <u>The Opium Habit</u>,
published in 1868, the modern day notion of Soldier's Disease
might never have developed. The latter of these two sentences by
Day (quoted by Terry and Pellens) is, by far, the most widely
cited writing on Soldier's Disease: </p>

<p><i>The events of the last few years [Civil War] have
unquestionably added greatly to their [confirmed opium eaters']
number. Maimed and shattered survivors from a hundred
battlefields, diseased and disabled soldiers released from
hostile prisons, anguished and hopeless wives and mothers made so
by the slaughter of those who were dearest to them, have found,
many of them, temporary relief from their sufferings in Opium.</i>
</p>

<p>(Day, 1868:1) </p>

<p>This remark, quoted by several modern writers,18 is the only
reference to the Civil War in Day's 335 page tome. Day recounts
many types of persons who were addicts, but not one specific case
of a soldier or veteran.19 in context, Day's two-sentence
allusion to the Civil War suggests an extremely minor problem
recounted by an encyclopedic problem-seeker.<br>
</p>

<p><b>A. </b><u>Courtwright's Evidence Is Skimpy<br>
</u></p>

<p>Courtwright recognizes that &quot;army disease&quot; was not
an &quot;epidemic,&quot; but still concludes: &quot;It is
possible to document numerous references to addicted veterans
both as a class and as individuals.&quot; (Courtwright, 1978:1 1
1) Using the same evidence, and more, I reach opposite
conclusions. Why? <br>
</p>

<p>In <u>Dark Paradise: Opiate Addiction In America Before 1940</u>,
Courtwright cites 1 18 books and articles published between the
Civil War and the end of the century (Courtwright, 1982) yet in
his studies of Soldier's Disease he lists nine references to
addicted veterans, and only five appeared in the 19th Century2O
and were to veterans who had used opiates during the Civil War.
Adding two more which I uncovered (Earle, 1880; Nolan, 188 1),
and including two other brief and vague references (Crothers,
1892 and 1893), this averages one reference every 4 years between
18651899. The overwhelming majority of articles about opiate use
written in the fifteen years following Appomatox, including
several by writers who presented lists of the types of people who
were addicts, do not single out the Civil War,21 nor can I find
such a reference in newspapers of the time.22 </p>

<p>None of these nine sources demonstrates that opiate addiction
by Civil War veterans was of social significance. In addition to
those previously quoted (Day and Nolan, who writes of the alibi
used by a deserter), there were three references by the most
prolific writers of the period, Mattison and Crothers (twice).23
Mattison's sole mention appears at the end of his career, 3 years
after the War ended. (Mattison, 1898) Crothers wrote
prolifically. If a &quot;drug problem&quot; could be unearthed,
trust Crothers to lead the digging party.24 In the context of his
encyclopedic writings, Crothers' few mentions of the Civil War
suggests its role in subsequent addiction was miniscule.
(Crothers, 1892 and 1893) Further, when World War I broke out in
Europe, Crothers urged combat physicians_to use opiates
liberally, and fears of a subsequent addiction problem were
groundless. (Crothers, 1916) Two other references are of tone
addicts, one -- of a long-time successful minister --
demonstrating the difficulty of detecting addiction at the time.
(Russell, 1887; and Keeley, 198 1) </p>

<p>B. <u>&quot;Only Your Pharmacist Knows For Sure&quot;<br>
</u></p>

<p>The two other references suggest that for a while, in some
places, there were some addicted veterans ... reported by those
who would notice addicts even if the general public did not
recognize them -- i.e. the apothecaries who sold opiates. Terry
and Pellens, reviewing an 1 878 study , noted that even
physicians did not recognize the extent of addiction: <br>
</p>

<p><i>Druggists were in a much better position to know the truth
.... when counter sales were legal, and as a matter of common
practice, physicians were called upon only by those opiate users
seeking (cure).</i> </p>

<p>(Terry and Pellens, 15)<br>
</p>

<p>A Massachusetts study of 1871 &quot;consulted&quot; 20-30
druggists and got mailed responses from 125 physicians. 40 of
these physicians did not know of a single case of &quot;opium
eating,&quot; and of 46 who commented on whether &quot;the
injurious use of opium has increased of late years,&quot; 6 1 %
answered it had not and another 13% answered it was diminishing.
Only one physician, but at least two druggists, stated that
opiate use begun during the late war was an important cause for
addiction. (Oliver, 1872) Without denying the significance of
this report, these mentions of addicted veterans had no
ramifications in the drug literature at the time. It was a state
publication with very limited circulation, the few summaries or
reviews of the report in the medical literature at the time did
not mention the Civil War,25 and save for Terry and Pellens'
lengthy excerpt from it in 1928 we might never have known that
some pharmacists, at least, recognized that addicted veterans, as
a class, were among the ranks of addicts.26 </p>

<p>In Chicago in 1880, 50 pharmacists were surveyed about the
cause of addiction of their regular opiate using customers. The
most mentioned were &quot; rheumatism and neuralgia&quot; (38
each); &quot;some&quot; respondents, (but less than four),
believed addiction was caused by sickness and pain and/or the
&quot;loss of property and position in society&quot; due to the
recent war. (Earle, 1880) (On another government survey, of
doctors in Michigan in 1878, the Civil War was not mentioned).
(Marshall, 1966) </p>

<p>In toto, these surveys indicate that there was a small,
temporary phenomenon of addicted veterans, which was not a social
problem in the sense that anyone but a few pharmacists recognized
it in the quarter century after the Civil War. </p>

<p><b>C. </b><u>&quot;Any&quot; Vs. &quot;Many&quot;</u> </p>

<p>No one doubts that all the opiates used to alleviate the pain
from all the chronic diseases and continuous pain resulting from
the Civil War resulted in some soldiers using and becoming
addicted to opiates. The issue, however, is not whether there
were <u>any</u> addicted veterans but if there were <u>many</u>.
Courtwright's contention that <b>&quot;a </b><i>substantial </i>number
of them (veterans) eventually became addicted to opium or
morphine,&quot; and that &quot;two events, the Civil War and the
spread of hypodermic medication, triggered a <b><i>massive </i></b>increase
in iatrogenic opium and especially morphine addiction,&quot;
(emphasis not in the original). (Courtwright, 1982) is
unwarranted.<br>
</p>

<p>In arguing that the importance of Soldier's Disease should not
be discounted, Courtwright stresses the importance on later 19th
Century addiction of the wrenching impact that War had on society
as a whole, such as the loss of loved ones, property, fortunes
and social position. By such reasoning, any social event or
condition which occurs in reasonable proximity before an increase
in drug use can be considered a &quot;cause.&quot; Ergo, the iron
horse can be blamed for late 19th century addiction, or movies
and television for the increased drug problems of the last few
decades. (In the Massachusetts study noted above, more
pharmacists reported state restrictions on the use of alcohol a
&quot;cause&quot; of recent opiate use than reported the Civil
War). However, Soldier's Disease is cited in the drug literature
the past few decades to imply something quite specific -- namely,
the presence of opiates, outside of strict and knowledgeable
medical control, ipso facto causes massive publicly noted
addiction, Nothing less. </p>

<p><b>5. </b><u>Soldier's Disease and Drug Policy</u> </p>

<p>In sum, Soldier's Disease proves to be another myth. In
reality, the widespread use of opiates during the Civil War
generated so infinitesimal a problem that only two or three
apothecaries, and two or three of the most encyclopedic drug
experts, even speculated on the possibility of addicted soldiers
from that War for almost half a century. Soldier's Disease did
not become the Conventional Wisdom until almost a century after
that war. </p>

<p>Implicit in the concept of Soldier's Disease are four aspects
of addiction which, together, are a paradigm used to justify
current opiate laws -- easy access leads to widespread use,
addiction is easy to acquire, hard to kick, and its consequences
are powerful and publicly obvious. In the popular contemporary
idiom, the paradigm consists of &quot;it's so good, don't even
try it once&quot;; &quot;once an addict, always an addict&quot;;
and in the image of the &quot;junkie&quot;. (Belief in this
paradigm, in the early 1970's, led many experts, and particularly
critics of U.S. military policy, to sound the tocsin about opiate
use by GIs for inevitably this would lead to a huge problem of
addicted veterans ... which it didn't)27 Since each aspect of the
paradigm is contradicted by the historical evidence, Soldier's
Disease is a mythic reconstruction of the past to make it
coincide with contemporary assumptions. <br>
</p>

<p>How significant is the paradigm in justifying opiate laws?
Each year over the past two decades the nation has spent billions
in drug law enforcement, resulting in an annual average of over a
half million drug arrests, and has spent billions for trying
those arrestees and incarcerating scores of thousands of them.
Until the mid-1980's, when cocaine replaced opiates as the most
often used and most frightening &quot;hard drug,&quot; the
dangers of opiate addiction formed the core of the nation's
perceived drug problem and most of the prisoners serving drug
sentences had been convicted on opiate charges. Additionally,
drugs are a major economic alternative for young poor people, as
well as a major source of police corruption. None of this --
neither the public money, arrests, incarcerations, the
competitive illegal economy, and police corruption -existed
regarding drugs until there were prohibitory laws. </p>

<p>How significant is Soldier's Disease for the paradigm which
shows opiate availability ipso facto causes a massive social
problem? As noted in Section I of this paper, there is no other
pre-Harrison Act example of a currently believable social
problem. Though an ancient and seemingly minor issue, addiction
among Civil War veterans functions as a lynchpin or cornerstone.
Strip away Soldier's Disease, and the only problem suggested by
the paradigm are the medical consequences of addiction, which
occurs in a large percentage of opiate users. The facts about
addiction among the Civil War's soldiers and veterans indicates
that widespread addiction, too, is a natural result of free
access to drugs. </p>

<p>The facts about Civil War drug use indicate open availability
and no recognizable negative consequences; the facts, the past
few generations, show extremely limited access to opiates and an
immense &quot;drug problem.&quot; It is in the illegal context
that the modern &quot;opiate problem&quot; arises, rather than in
a legal context such as the Civil War. The chemistry lesson of
the Civil War is that opiates per se do not cause the problem,
the context does.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>FOOTNOTES</u></b> </p>

<p><b>1 </b>The imagery of the &quot;leather thong around his
neck and a leather bag&quot; is, to my knowledge, unique to
Starkey. </p>

<p>2 Occasionally a moralistic author of the late 19th Century
cited a social problem with opiates which no-one else ever
noticed, but two problems were repeated enough to warrant
comment. T.D. Crothers in several articles claimed that morphine,
in particular, led to crime. According to one scholar who studied
the period, &quot;No other writer ... asserts the strength and
ubiquity of this association .... (and) it is extremely difficult
to accept the validity of his position.&quot; (Swatos, 1972),
though at least one other expert claimed, as an alibi in a trial
for a property crime, (Kane, 1882b), that the cost of opiates
forced some persons with huge habits to steal. Still, before the
laws all but the extremely poor could easily afford any size
habit. Crothers' unique assertions about opiate-caused crime can
not justify a policy which generates the extraordinary
drug-related crime of today. </p>

<p>There were also occasional reports that addicts were lethargic
and neglectful of personal hygiene and business. However, the
types of people on 19th Century lists of addicts, were typically
in demanding jobs. That, said the experts at the time, was why
they sought the &quot;stimulating&quot; effects of opiates. The
many reports of people not knowing their spouses were long term
addicts suggests that the lethargy and inattentiveness to
business was hardly blatant. Aside from the racist comments about
opiate use in Chinatowns, the allegation that opiates effected
the performance of a class of persons, such as impeding the
performance of soldiers (S.F. Call, 19 1 Ob), was rare. </p>

<p>3 Terry and Pellens, in their encyclopedic classic The Opium
Problem, also report import statistics, as does Kane, the author
of the longest scholarly work in the early 1880's. (Terry and
Pellens, 1928:50-5 1; and Kane, 1880). <br>
</p>

<p>4 &quot;It has been reported that for many years husbands and
wives, to say nothing of other members of a family, have lived in
complete ignorance of the existence of this condition in one or
the other.&quot; (Terry and Pellens: 2)<br>

<p>7 The obvious racism manifest in such headlines as

</p>

<p>The S.F. Call on occasion linked opiate use to crime or
lunacy, but each time the details indicated the problem was a
result of the law. (S.F. Call, 1910c and d, and 1911a) New York
City's Commissioner of Corrections said that if addicts are
deprived of opiates on arrest, &quot;normal persons ... very
frequently go insane.&quot; (N.Y. Times, 1914) <br>
</p>

<p>9 Estimates of the number of opiate addicts and &quot;cocaine
fiends&quot; circa 1915 varied enormously. Marks' estimated
4,000,000; a U.S. Public Health Service expert estimated a
minimum of 70,000 and, elsewhere, &quot; I 18,000.... (and)
granting (a) somewhat improbable assertion ... a maximum not more
than 187,000 users of opium,&quot; (Marks, 1915; Wilbert, 1914
and 1915). </p>

<p>10 Had <u>The Opium Problem</u> gained earlier recognition as
a classic, Soldier's Disease might have been the conventional
wisdom of drug experts before the late 1950's. The original 1928
printing of 400 copies not sold out for decades. A 1 970 reprint
sold much better. </p>

<p>12 Soldier's Disease was cited in publications by several
influential government agencies and prestigious commissions
created to address the drug issue. Starting with 1973, references
to Soldier's Disease can be found in: Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department, 1974; National Commission on Marihuana, 1973;
Organized Crime Task Force, 1984; President's Commission on
Organized Crime, 1986; Strategy Council, 1975; U.S. Attorney
General, 1984: and U.S. Department of H.E.W., 1975. </p>

<p>13 Despite my many criticisms, I respect Courtwright's
judiciousness and his willingness to grapple with the issue
(which no other expert who claims Soldier's Disease has done), He
recognizes and responds to contrary evidence, and criticizes
simplistic recitations of Soldier's Disease. </p>

<p><b>14 </b>Of the authors the past 30 years who report
widespread addiction by Civil War veterans, over a third mention
Soldier's Disease, a third denote Army Disease, an occasional
author labels it Soldier's Illness or Soldier's Sickness, and the
others describe the phenomenon without noting a sobriquet. </p>

<p>15 The officer confessed at his trial that he was
&quot;suffering for want of the drug (opium) ... (and) so great
was the craving that he temporarily deserted his post to ...
obtain it, though knowing that his life would thereby be
forfeited.&quot; (Nolan, 188 1). This smacks of tales from the
1930's of murderers caught red-handed who, desperate to avoid the
electric chair, claimed marijuana &quot;caused&quot; their crime.
</p>

<p>16 The failure to note opiate addiction as a significant
problem was not due to the absence of the concept of addiction
during and just after the Civil War, The commissioners of the
Prison Association of New York in 1866 reported that men &quot;of
a low order of morals ... (were) addicted to habits of profanity
and intemperance.&quot; (North American Review, 1867:570) </p>

<p>17 An article on opiates by Mitchell -- on the effects of
opiates on birds -confirms him as an eccentric scientist. (Boston
MSJ, 1870) Weir found that morphia did not induce steep
&quot;beyond a slight tendency to quietude, which we can never be
sure is not due to the habit of the wounded or sick pigeon of
seeking a remote corner and remaining at rest,&quot; but
&quot;used hypodermically in excessive amounts ... act as
excitants .... (and) in the duck they approach nearest to the
typical strychnic spasm.&quot; Weir also found &quot;great
difficulty with which pigeons, especially old birds, are poisoned
by opiates.&quot; </p>

<p>In All or part of Day's two sentences on the Civil War are
quoted by five 20th Century writers, (Brecher et. al., 1972;
Courtwright, 1978; Cuskey, </p>

<p>Premkunar and Sigel, 1972; Quinones, 1975; and Terry and
Pellens, 1928), and closely paraphrased without attribution by
some others. </p>

<p>19 Calkins, Day's contemporary, refers to over 200 cases in <u>Opium
and the Opium Appetite</u>. but not one soldier who began opiate
use between 1861-65.<br>
</p>

<p>20 Courtwright and Terry and Pellens cite addicted Civil War
veterans who came to public attention in the 20th Century as
evidence of that war's impact on subsequent addiction. Besides
lending credence to the phenomenon they also demonstrate that
such addiction was benign and unnoticed. The octogenarians cited
in 1928 by Terry and Pellens (&quot;today in more than one old
soldiers' home are cases of chronic opium addiction which date
from this (Civil War) period&quot;) (Terry and Pellens, 69), or
the 82 year old Confederate veteran who &quot;had been shot in
the head during the Civil War&quot; and &quot;had been addicted
55 years&quot; under medical supervision since then, (Waldorf,
1973), reveal that the addiction of veterans was not <i>a social
problem, </i>and not even <i>a medical problem </i>until
prohibition of opiates. </p>

<p>21 Apart from Courtwright's citations, of the 29 books or
largest articles about opiates, published between 1865-1879,
which I have located, there is not an original reference to
soldiers addicted during the Civil War. (Brown, 1972: Calkins,
1867 and 1871; Chaille, 1876; M.D., 1878; Frost, 1870; Gibbons,
1870: Gould, 1878; Harrington, 1878; Ingals, 1877 and 1878;
Layard, 1874 and 1878; Lippincott's, 1868; Ludlow, 1867;
Mattison, 1876 a and b, and 1878 a and b; McFarland, 1877;
National Quarterly Review, 1870; Parrish, 1869 and 1873; Popular
Science, 1875; The Probe, 1869 a and b: Richet, 1878; R.S., 1869;
and Warren, 1867). Several times as many articles were shorter
pieces, and likewise <u>made</u> no mention of addiction linked
to the Civil War. </p>

<p>22 Four lengthy newspaper articles during the 1870's, about
non-Chinese opiate use, do not mention soldiers or veterans of
the Civil War. (New York Daily Herald, 1877 and 1878; and New
York Times, 1877 and 1878). </p>

<p>23 Two of the four 20th Century sources cited by Courtwright
were also works by Crothers. (Crothers, 1900 and 1902). </p>

<p>24 Headings of 7 of the 18 chapters in Crothers' book <u>Morphinism
and Narcomanias From Other Drugs</u> are &quot;Chloralism ....
Chioroformism .... Coffee Addiction .... Tea Inebriety ....
Tobacco Inebriety .... Ether Inebriety .... (and) Addictions From
Other Drugs,&quot; these &quot;others&quot; including arsenic,
ginger, cologne and lavender. (Crothers, 198 lb) </p>

<p>25 Three reviews of the 1872 Massachusetts study appeared in
medical journals at the time. None mentioned the Civil War (Amer.
J of Medical Sciences, 1872; and Lancet, 1873), and one even
considered the reports of opiate habituation &quot;exaggerated
.... a piece of scandal,&quot; witness that in its subsequent
annual report the Massachusetts Board of Health made &quot;no
allusion whatsoever to the subject (of opiates)&quot; (Medical
Times, 1873). </p>

<p>26 Morgan provides a lengthier excerpt of the 1872
Massachusetts study than did Terry and Pellens, but omits the
physician's, and two pharmacists', comments. The single sentence
relevant to the Civil War -- &quot;The taste for opium eating
among soldiers retired from the army is alluded to by a few of
our correspondents&quot; -- follows a listing of other causes of
addiction, (injudicious prescribing, depressed nervous systems,
overwork with deficient nutrition, a vicious mode of life, and
intemperance). </p>

<p>27 In several fundamental respects, the opiate use of soldiers
and veterans of the Vietnam War is not analogous to the Civil War
situation, though the fears about what widespread opiate use
among GIs would engender once they were mustered out exactly
parallels the fears implicit in Soldier's Disease. The soldiers
who used opiates in the Civil War did so to alleviate the pain
from wounds, and to help cure &quot;the fluxes,&quot; but using
such drugs &quot;to get high&quot; or to reduce stress were the
essential reasons for opiate use by Vietnam era GIs. In so far as
a few veterans continued regularly using opiates in the 1970's
and 1980's, they contributed to a social problem because, in the
context of illegality, any regular opiate use tends to be a
financial burden and criminal problem. The counterparts of these
GIs, a century earlier, went unnoticed. Further, the fact that so
many GIs abandoned opiate use once out of Vietnam can be argued
as a demonstration of the effects of the U.S. approach of massive
treatment opportunities and massive enforcement. The handful of
addicted veterans after the Civil War would suggest that
suppression is not the root cause of why regular opiate users
quit before becoming addicted.<br>

<h1>&quot;American Prohibitionists and Violence, 1865-1920&quot; </h1>

<p> by Richard Hamm </p>

<p> Today I want to post part of a paper I delivered at a Meeting
of the Alcohol and Temperance History Group as an Affiliated
Society of the American Association for the History of Medicine,
at its 68th Annual Meeting at Pittsburgh in May 1995. At that
time I said I wasn't planning to publish it, for various reasons,
but I have been urged by people whose views I value to
disseminate it, so I placed it-in pieces-on the List serve of the
ATHG. It brought forth a good string, so I have agreed to place
this piece (essentially the Pittsburgh paper) on the Web page of
the ATHG. </p>

<p> The prohibitionists were social reform agitators who sought a
major change in their society's customs. Social reformers have
been, of course, a nearly constant presence in American society
since the early 19th century. Accounts of many social reformers'
campaigns, often deal with the violence inflicted upon reformers
seeking change in society and the violence engaged in by some
reformers to achieve their ends. Indeed, violence, even killing
and attempted killing, seems almost endemic to the history of
social reforms in the United States. But, with the special cases
of the Women's crusades of 1873 and Carry Nation aside, the vast-
and ever-growing literature on the temperance movement pays
little attention to the issue of violence.(1) This gap is a
serious deficiency. </p>

<p> There are two limits to my work. First, I am most interested
in violence in its most dramatic and drastic forms, killing or
attempting to kill people. So I will be talking mostly of
killings, attempted killings, and mobbings (because after all
they can easily lead to killings). Second, I am talking about
violence in respons to or as a part of agitation and not violence
attendant to law enforcement. Thus I am going to pass over
silently the many studies, popular and not, of moonshining,
bootlegging, and violence.(2) Violence in resistance to law or
violence undertaken by law officers is somewhat separate from
violence associated with a social reform movement's agitation for
change. Such violence grows out the state's presumption to have a
monopoly of force and its willingness to resort to force to gain
the ends of its policy. To break the law of the state is to risk
its use of violence against you, hence the likelihood that the
law breaker will engage in violence. Law enforcement and violence
go together hand and glove. </p>

<p> But within these limits there still broad area of violence to
be explored as reform and violence also seem to go together. We
can break down violence associated with reform into two large
categories. First, violence, used by their opponents, to stop
reformers from agitating. Second, violence by reformers directed
at achieving their ends-in their view, a righteous violence. A
brief look of some reforms in American history shows the
existence of these two types of violence. </p>

<p> Violence to deter reform, for example, surfaces in studies
and memory of the civil rights movement. The literature is filled
with works that explore the violence directed against civil
rights advocates in the American South in the 1950s and 1960s. We
all know of the bombing of the Birmingham churches, the mobbing
of sit in protesters and freedom riders, and the killing of
Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney.(3) Similarly, contemporary
commentary on the anti-abortion movement has focused on the wave
of violence against doctors and workers at women's health
centers, most notably in the cases of Pensacola shootings and the
recent the shootings in Brookline. </p>

<p> Historians of abolitionists, perhaps the most deeply studied
of all social reform movements, have delineated both types of
violence in that crusade. They have explored the many
anti-abolitionist mobs of the Jacksonian era, including that
which mobbed and killed the abolitionist editor Eliajah Lovejoy
in 1837. Also, they have spent considerable effort exploring the
forces and meaning of John Brown's and other abolitionists'
willingness to engage in terrorism to bring about the end of
slavery.(4) But virtually no where in the vast scholarly studies
of the prohibition movement are there similar studies of the
prohibitionists and violence. Its not because violence is not
there </p>

<p> On the issue of deadly violence against agitators, the recent
scholarly literature is almost silent on the subject but the drys
themselves recorded that it happened. The temperance movement at
its peak, sought to encourage the faithful and to preserve the
records of its achievements and struggles by publishing, among
other things, prohibition encyclopedias. Two standard reference
books produced by the drys, <i>The Pocket Cyclopedia of
Temperance</i> (1916) and <i>Standard Encyclopedia of the Alcohol
Problem</i> (1925-1930) show that drys included information on
violence against prohibitionists. Both works contain articles on
so called &quot;Temperance Martyrs.&quot; Indeed, scattered
through the six volumes and 2940 page <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are many accounts of mobbings, attempted killings, and killings
of drys. Some of the stories in the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
are classics. For instance, it details in the article on
Pennsylvania how a county chairman of the Anti-Saloon League was
shot at in 1913, but &quot;fortunately the bullet, intended for
his heart, was arrested by a copy of the bible which he carried
under his arm.&quot; The article includes a picture of the page
where the bullet was stopped. While such miraculous tales were
rare, pedestrian tales of violence were common in the temperance
movement.(5) </p>

<p> I have combined the counts of the <i>Standard Encyclopedia</i>
and the <i>Pocket Encyclopedia</i> to come up with some ball park
figures of the violence directed against prohibitionists. These
numbers exclude from them prohibitionists who suffered violence
as a result of official or unofficial law enforcement or (from
the sources available) who suffered violence in uncertain
circumstances. For example, a minister who denounced violators of
a state prohibition law and sought to bring private prosecutions
in the courts and suffered violence would be in this estimate
engaging in unofficial law enforcement and is not included in the
figures of prohibitionist agitators who experienced violence.
Including such persons would roughly double the number of
assaults and triple the number of the killings. Combining the two
lists, I have found the names of six drys who between 1874 and
1908 were killed over their advocacy of their cause. At least
another nineteen drys were mobbed, beaten, shot at, or had their
homes (or businesses) dynamited for their support of
temperance.(6) </p>

<p> Without a doubt, advocating prohibition was a dangerous
business for some of its agitators. On the other hand, the
temperance advocates seemed not to have engaged in violence
against their enemies. I know of no prohibitionist who engaged in
violence to the point of killing to bring about their goal of a
dry nation. Some prohibitionists, Carry Nation being the most
prominent though certainly not alone, did engage in direct action
against liquor sellers, destroying their place of business and
their stock through violent means. Assaults on people sometimes
emerged from such attacks. But such &quot;hatchetation&quot;
aside, the prohibitionists did not seem to engage violence that
could lead to killing. I would like to is explain two things.
First, why the violence against drys has received so little
attention. And second, explain the relative dearth of righteous
violence by drys. </p>

<p> Why does the scholarly literature not contain much
information on the topic of violence against prohibitionist
agitators? One explanation can be dismissed out of hand, that is
that those who the opponents perpetuated their deeds against were
too obscure to make an impact. Among the six prohibitionist
killed, are a doctor, a judge, a minister, four editors of reform
or other newspapers (including the minister), and a United States
Senator. (The Senator is Edward Carmack of Tennessee.) If you
turn toward those who suffered assaults or mobbing for agitation
on the temperance question, the trend is similar with editors and
ministers predominating. Those attacked included figures of some
renown in temperance history; for example Albert Banks-clergyman,
dry editor, and propagandist- was shot and wounded and Samuel W.
(&quot;Sam&quot;) Small- journalist, dry, and evangelist-was
mobbed and beaten. The violence occurred in all areas of the
nation, though the South and West seem disproportionally
represented, and extended from the decade after the Civil War
through the second decade of the 20th century. It should appear
much more prominently in the scholarly literature. </p>

<p> Two general causes seem to explain why the violence against
prohibitionists for their agitation has received so little
attention. First, contentions from the time of the killing or
other violence that the violence had nothing to do with
prohibition may have led scholars not to consider the topic.
Second, and more importantly, there was little place for accounts
of such violence in the evolving scholarly interpretations of
prohibition. </p>

<p> I know of at least one example of a dry killed over his
advocacy of prohibition where non-prohibitionists sources
asserted that he &quot;was not slain because of his convictions
but&quot; because of a &quot;personal difficulty.&quot;(7) If
other killings and attacks have similar conflicting accounts (and
logic would indicate that they should, as it was in the interests
of the opponents of prohibition to downplay violence against
their enemies) it is likely that scholars have been misdirected
away from the topic of violence against dry agitators. But, there
is little evidence that scholars have paid any attention to the
topic at all. </p>

<p> While scholarly interpretations of prohibition have changed
dramatically over time, all of them share the trait that they
either have little room in their frameworks for discussions of
violence or have a tendency to turn scholars away from approaches
and sources that would explore issues violence. Since World War
II, scholarly interpretations of prohibition have been marked by
two large trends. First, there is the focus on the social status
of the members of the movement.(8) Second, there is the question
of how, if at all, prohibition related to the reform movements of
the day: populism, progressivism, and women's rights.(9) Scholars
working in the field have thus tended to mine the sources to
answer questions about these concerns. Thus by combing membership
rolls, church records, tax records, census data, and other
sources they have told us much about the social status of the
prohibitionists. Similarly in exploring the links between
anti-monopolism, regulation, peace reform, women's suffrage,
divorce reform, and anti-prostitution (just to name some)
scholars have illuminated the connections of the movement to
other reforms. But in doing these things they have mostly
eschewed writing narratives of movement history that would have
confronted the sources that raise the questions of violence
against drys and violence by drys.(10) It is to violence by drys
that I would like to turn now. </p>

<p> One thing is clear about violence by drys: there was no dry
equivalent to John Brown, there was no dry equivalent to Michael
F. Griffin or John Salvi The closest that the prohibition
movement ever came to such figures was Carry Nation. Nation's
trashing of saloons is the stuff of American legend and folklore.
Moreover it has been the subject of some scholarly work.(11) Thus
a look at Nation and her movement in the context of the righteous
violence of other movements is illuminating. </p>

<p> When we talk about figures in reform movements adopting
violence, two things stand out. First that they believed that
their violence is justified; violence-even killing-has become an
acceptable means of bringing about the change that they want.
Second, they act violently because they perceive that their
movement is loosing ground. Hence John Brown's moral certainty of
the evil of slavery and belief that sin could only be expatiated
by the spilling of blood convinced him that violence was
acceptable. He, in turn, convinced others to fight and kill with
him in Kansas and Virginia because, after the Compromise of 1850
with its Fugitive Slave Law and the Kansas Nebraska Act repealing
the Missouri compromise, for the abolitionists crusade their
enemies seemed to have gained the upper hand.(12) Similarly, the
justifiable homicide argument used by the advocates of violence
in the anti-abortion movement give them a moral base for their
actions.(13) Significantly, also, the first killing by
anti-abortionists came after it became clear that the Supreme
Court was not going to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> </p>

<p> , the second came after a pro-abortion candidate was elected
president. How do these two factors, developing a view that see
the violence as acceptable and acting out of fear of failure of
the reform play out in the prohibition movement and in the career
of Carry Nation? </p>

<p> There was a potential for developing an ideology of righteous
violence, in the prohibition movement. And evidence of it does
not rest alone on the career of Carry Nation. Before I turn to
Nation and her ideas for justifying her violence, let me turn to
another source that show that drys did enunciate such ideas. The
1915 novel <i>Quarrytown</i>, written by Douglas Dobbins and
published by the American Issue Publishing (the press of company
of the Anti-Saloon League) shows community organized righteous
violence in a favorable light. In this fictionalized account of
the struggle against the return of saloons to a stone quarrying
town, the drys ultimately resort to violence. </p>

<p> At the opening the town is dry and virtually free of crime.
But the dry utopia vanishes, as neither law nor community action
offer adequate protection from the evil trade. Drys fail to block
the issuing of a liquor license at a state liquor licensing board
(dominated by politicians beholden to the organized liquor
interest), a dry organized boycott falters when its denounced by
a new editor of the town's newspaper, and citizen prosecutions of
the saloon keeper for violations of the law falter before
corrupted juries. Thus the saloon spreads crime and disorder
throughout the community, literally turning brother against
brother in drunken brawls. After all other means have been tried
the dry townsmen resort to violence. One night after the saloon
is shut, they engage a Boston Tea Party type raid on it,
destroying its fixtures and stock. When the newspaper editor
condemns the act as lawlessness he is ostracized by the town.
When the saloon keeper rebuilds, the temperance men of the town
blow up the establishment with three separate dynamite bombs, the
first being set away from where the proprietor slept to allow him
time to escape. Moreover, the local minister preached a sermon in
advance of the act calling for the blowing up of &quot;every
hell-hole in the United States tomorrow with dynamite!&quot; And
in case the message was not clear, the dynamite works. The saloon
keeper never came back and the town was the better for it: no
murders, or assaults, no wife beatings, and no squandering of
food and education money on whisky occur within its borders.(14) </p>

<p> Without ever saying it in so many words, this publication of
the Anti-Saloon League legitimated violence against saloons. But
it did so in a rather limited way. Violence was not the first
resort, but the last resort for the drys of Quarrytown. Its only
because law and boycotts have failed them, and only after liquor
begins to wreck havoc in their community do they take action. And
their first action, does not threaten life or limb. Even the
bombing is planned to allow the saloon keeper to escape harm.
Similarly, Carry Nation carried the conviction that her violence
was justified and resorted to violence only after other means had
failed. </p>

<p> Once you get past the myth and hype, Nation's short career as
a saloon smasher is revealing of the potential of righteous
violence in the prohibition movement. Nation captured the
national imagination in 1900 when she began single-handedly
destroying dives in Kansas. Her actions were quickly overshadowed
by the hucksterism to which she resorted to keep her agitation
going: the selling of hatchets and the appearances at resorts
like Coney Island. She remained a national figure until her death
in 1911. Nation was motivated, like many drys, by a personal
religious belief that liquor selling was sinful. Indeed, in her
autobiography she recounting receiving visions from God showing
her the evils of liquor. And she adopted violence only after
other she had tried other means.(15) </p>

<p> In 1900 Nation lived in state that had a two decade old, and
widely violated, policy of prohibition. Moreover, it must of have
seemed to her that the temperance movement was in a rut. In her
town of Medicine Lodge, working with the WCTU she closed the
town's seven bars through the tried a true techniques of the
women's crusade of 1873: picketing with song, prayer, and moral
appeals to the sellers and purchasers. These were techniques that
had been used against legal saloons, in Kansas there were nothing
but illegal ones. Moreover, for a decade now in Kansas the policy
had been widely violated, often with the contrivances of the
state's political leaders. And at the national level the
temperance movement was stalled. Between 1889 and 1907 no state
adopted prohibition. WCTU had lost its driving force with the
death of Frances Willard in 1898 and the Prohibition Party had
splintered into two warring camps. The leading temperance
organizations seemed unable to advance the cause or indeed to
stop the rollback movements in various states with prohibition.
Hence, with conviction, and at a time when the movement was
faltering, Nation turned away from moral suasion and turned to
violence. As she explained, &quot;If there's anything that's weak
and worse than useless it's this moral suasion. I despise it.
these hell traps of Kansas have fattened for twenty years on
moral suasion.&quot;(16) </p>

<p> And her violence struck a chord among some temperance
advocates. While some debated the value of violence, others
joined Nation. She soon headed an organization of several hundred
similarly minded saloon foes. And, in a two month period,
following her lead this group, and others, engaged in vigilante
action against saloons in Kansas's major cities, Topeka and
Wichita. Mobbings and riots swept the cities; people were beaten
and shots were fired in anger. And among some temperance workers
the violence was welcome. One woman letter writer to a WCTU paper
wrote: &quot;What if a few people do get killed[?] . . . I'm
tired of this sentimental gush about 'stopping before it comes to
bloodshed. . . .' I for one, hope a thousand more of them will be
smashed in Kansas before she stops.&quot; The response to Nation,
shows that the potential for righteous violence existed in the
temperance crusade.(17) </p>

<p> Which raises new questions: Why was there only one Carry
Nation? Part of the answer lays in the changing circumstances of
the prohibition movement. Soon after Nation's actions in Kansas,
the Anti-Saloon League emerged as the dominate organization in
the temperance movement. And the League's techniques of political
lobbying, official law enforcement, and public opinion building
changed the fortunes of the crusade. For example, take the topic
of national legislation; the League's Washington Office, between
1902 and 1919, pressured the United States Congress to enact laws
that: prohibited the sale of liquor in federal buildings, banned
the transport of liquor through the mails, ended liquor sales in
national soldiers' homes, retained a law excluding all alcoholic
beverages from Army posts, created Oklahoma as a dry state, and
limited and then prohibited the transportation of liquor into dry
states. A similar record of success can be found in the
prohibitionists' campaigns in the states in the same period.(18)
The very success of the drys in gaining what they wanted through
the political process made righteous violence redundant. </p>

<p> This pattern of potential righteous violence in the
prohibition crusade and the mostly unstudied violence used
against drys by their opponents, suggest that we need to look
more deeply into prohibition as a reform movement. As Robin Room
wrote over twenty years ago, &quot;we must attempt to understand
the antiliquor movement . . . as a massive, sustained organized
effort with a highly developed set of tactics and coherent,
tangible goals.&quot; (19) Indeed, if we seek a usable past, one
that might help deal with current social reform crusades, say
against abortion or cigarettes, it is imperative that we look,
far deeper than I have here, into tactics, strategies, and
contexts, of the temperance crusade to see how they prompted or
retarded violence. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> (1) Typical of the treatment of the topic of violence and the
prohibitionists can be found in examining the three available
surveys of the movement's history. Norman Clark, <i>Deliver Us
From Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition</i>(New
York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1976) and Paul Aaron and David
Musto, &quot;Temperance and Prohibition In America: A Historical
Overview&quot; in Mark H. Moore and Dean Gernstein, eds., <i>Alcohol
and Public Policy: Beyond the Shadow of Prohibition</i>
(Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1981), 127-181 devote no
space to the topic. Jack S. Blocker, Jr. <i>American Temperance
Movements: Cycles of Reform</i>(Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1989),
30- 34, 59-64, 74-79 mentions violence in connection with
enforcement of the Maine Law and in the direct action of the
women's crusades of 1873 and their precursors. Moreover, Mark
Lender, editor, <i>Dictionary of American Temperance Biography</i>
(Westport CT: Greenwood Press, 1984) does not contain a sketch of
any prohibitionists killed, either as response to agigation or
because law enforcement activities. </p>

<p> Three works discuss the role of violence associated with
temperance reform. Jed Dannebaum, <i>Drink and Disorder:
Temperance Reform in Cincinnati from the Washington Revival to
the WCTU</i> (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press,
1984) and Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give to the Winds Thy
Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade, 1873-1874</i>
(Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985); Robert Bader, <i>Prohibition
in Kansas</i> (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1986). </p>

<p> On liquor law enforcement before national prohibition see:
Stephen Cresswell, <i>Mormons, Cowbosy, Moonshiners, and
Klansmen: Federal Law Enforcment in the South and West, 1870-
1893</i> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1991); William
F. Holmes, &quot;Moonshining and Collective Violence: Georgia,
1889- 1895,&quot; <i>Journal of American History</i> 67 (1980):
589-611; William F. Holmes, &quot;Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence
in Mississippi, 1902-1906,&quot; <i>Journal of Southern History</i>
35 (1969): 165-185; Wilbur R. Miller, <i>Revenuers and
Moonshiners: Enforcing Federal Liquor Law in the Mountain South,
1865-1900</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1991). </p>

<p> (2) Indeed, certain killings connected to the civil rights
crusade have been used to illuminate the very nature of the
movement and its opponents. See for example, Seth Cagin and
Philip Dray, <i>We Are Not Afraid: The Story of Goodman,
Schwerner and Chaney and the Civil Rights Campaign for
Mississippi</i> (New York: Bantam Books, 1988) and Herbert
Shapiro, <i>White Violence and Black Response From Reconstruction
to Montgomery</i> (Amherst: University of Massachsetts Press,
1988). </p>

<p> (3)On the topic of abolitionist violence and their reactions
to violence see, Jane H. Pease and William Pease,
&quot;Confrontation and Abolition in the 1850s,&quot; <i>Journal
of American History</i> 58 (1972): 923-937; John Demos, &quot;The
Antislavery Movement and the Problem of Violent 'Means,'&quot; <i>New
England Quarterly</i> 37 (1964): 501-526; Lewis Perry, <i>Radical
Abolitionism: Anarchy and the Government of God in Antislaery
Thought</i> (Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1973); Michael
Fellman, &quot;Rehearsal for the Civil War: Antislavery and
Proslavery at the Fighting Point in Kansas, 1854-1856,&quot; in
Lewis Perry and Michael Fellman, <i>Antislavery Reconsidered: New
Perspectives on the Abolitionists</i> (Baton Rouge: Louisiana
University Press, 1979), 287-307; Silvan S. Tomkins, &quot;The
Psychology of Commitment: The Constructive Role of Violence and
Suffering for the Individual and for His Society, in Martin
Duberman, editor, <i>The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the
Abolitionists</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1965),
270-298. On violence directed against abolitionists see <i>&quot;Gentleman
of Property and Standing:&quot; Anti-Aboliton Mobs in Jacksonian
America</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1970). Beyond
specific works that deal with violence, three surveys of the
abolitionist crusade show how intergal the topics of violence are
to the reform's history as they devote attention to both the
violence against and by abolitionists: Ronald G. Walters, <i>The
Antislavery Appeal: American Abolitionism After 1830</i> (New
York: Norton, 1978); Merton L. Dillon, <i>The Abolitionists: the
Growth of a Dissenting Minority</i> (Dekalb: Northern Illinois
University Press, 1974) and James B. Stewart, <i>Holy Warriors:
The Abolitionists and American Slavery</i> (New York: Hill and
Wang, 1976). </p>

midway through the crusade, drys were recording the suffering of
their martyrs, see: <i>Cyclopaedia of Temperance and Prohibition</i>
(New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1891), 201-202. </p>

<p> (5) The list, derrived from <i>SEAP</i> and <i>Pocket</i>
includes: Dr. J. W. Beal and Judge D. R. Cox both killed in
Malden, Missouri on Februray 18 1907; Edward W. Carmack, United
States Senator from Tennessee, shot November 9, 1908 in
Nashville; Sam D. Cox, editor and publisher of <i>The Sentinel</i>
killed in Minatare, Nebraska on December 20 1906: Roderick D.
Gambrell, editor of <i>The Sword and Shield</i> killed in
Jackson, Mississippi on May 5, 1887; Rev. John R. Moffett, editor
of <i>Anti-Liquor</i> shot on November 11, 1892 in Danville
Virginia; and Joseph B. Rucker editor of the <i>Somerset Reporter</i>
killed in Somerset, Kentucky on September 19, 1892. Two of these
killings have received scholarly treatment, Paul Isaac, <i>Prohibition
and Politics: Turbulent Decades in Tennessee, 1885-1920</i>
(Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1965) and Richard F.
Hamm, &quot;The Killing of John R. Moffett and the Trial of J. T.
Clark: Race, Prohibition, and Politics in Danville,
1887-1893,&quot; <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</i>
101 (1993): 375-404 </p>

<p> (6) This is the case of John R. Moffett, for details see:
Hamm, &quot;Killing.&quot; The assertion that Moffett did not die
for his convictions generated a controversy between the slain
man's brother and William Copeland, editor of the Danville paper
at Moffett's death and later editor of the <i>Times Dispatch</i>.

<p> (7) After the pioneering work of Joseph Gusfield on the
social status of temperance reformers, scholars rushed to test
this theory, and for nearly a generation, the study of
prohibition focused, as the title of one article put it, on
&quot;The Prohibitionists Who Were They?&quot; Joseph R.
Gusfield, <i>Symbolic Crusade: Status Politics and the American
Temperance Movement</i> (Urbana: University of Illinois Press,
1963); Jack Blocker, Jr. &quot;Modernity of Prohibitionists&quot;
and Charles A. Isetts, &quot;A Social Profile of WCTU Crusade:
Hillsboro, Ohio&quot; in Jack Blocker Jr., ed., <i>Alcohol Reform
and Society: the Liquor Issue in Social Context</i> (Westport,
CN: Greenwood Press, 1979), 99-110, 149-170; Robert A. Hohner,
&quot;The Prohibitionists: Who Were They?&quot; <i>South Atlantic
Quarterly</i> 68 (1969): 491-505; Jack S. Blocker Jr., <i>&quot;Give
to the Winds Thy Fears&quot;: The Women's Temperance Crusade,
1873-1874</i> (Westport, CN: Greenwood Press, 1985). The salience
of relgious idenity and the prohibition issue emerged as a topic
in political histories. Richard Jenson, <i>The Winning of the
Midwest, Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896 </i>(Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1971); Paul Kleppner, <i>The Cross
of Culture: A Social Analysis of Midwestern Politics, 1885-1900</i>
(New York: MacMillian Free Press, 1970); Jed Dannebaum,
&quot;Immigrants and Temperance: Ethnocultural Conflict in
Cincinnati, 1845-1860&quot; <i>Ohio History</i> 87 (Autumn 1978):
125-139. </p>

<p> (8) On the issue of whether prohibition should be considered
a progressive reform, Richard Hofstader in <i>The American
Political Tradition</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1954) and in <i>Age
of Reform</i> (New York: Vintage Books, 1955) and Andrew
Sinclair, <i>Era of Excess: A Social History of the Prohibition
Movement</i> (New York: Harper and Row, 1962) argued no. John
Burnham in &quot;New Perspectives on the Prohibition 'Experiment'
of the 1920s&quot; <i>Journal of Social History </i>2 (1968):
51-68; and James Timberlake in <i>Prohibition and the Progressive
Movement, 1900-1920</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1963) challenged that view. Jack S. Blocker, Jr., <i>Retreat from
Reform: The Prohibition Movement in the United States, 1890-1913</i>
(Westport: Greenwood Press, 1976) plotted the temperance
movement's abandonment of broader social reform to concentrate on
prohibition alone. Works by, Norman Clark and Austin Kerr,
utilizing the organizational interpretation of Robert Wiebe,
placed prohibition firmly within the panapoly of progressive
reforms. See Clark, <i>Deliver Us From Evil</i>; K. Austin Kerr, <i>Organized
for Prohibition: A New History of the Anti-Saloon League</i> (New
Haven, CN: Yale University Press, 1985). On the organizational
interpretation see: Louis Galambos, &quot;The Emerging
Organizational Synthesis of Modern American History,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 44 (Autumn 1980): 279-90; Samuel P. Hays, <i>Response
to Industrialism, 1885-1914</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, 1957), 48- 70; Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., <i>The Visible
Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business</i>
(Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1977); Louis Galambos,
&quot;Technology, Political Economy, and Professionalization:
Central Themes of the Organizational Synthesis,&quot; <i>Business
History Review</i> 57 (Winter 1983): 471-93. Recently, the work
on temperance reform has focused on its relationship with larger
question of reform in the history of women. Ruth Bordin, <i>Woman
and Temperance </i>(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1981),
15-33; Barbara Leslie Epstein, <i>The Politics of Domesticity:
Women, Evangelism and Temperance in Nineteenth Century America</i>
(Middletown, CN: Wesleyan University Press, 1981, 1986); Ruth
Bordin, <i>Francis Willard: A Biography</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 1986); Ian Tyrrell, <i>Woman's
World Woman's Empire: the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in
International Perspective, 1880-1930</i> (Chapel Hill, NC:
University of North Carolina Press, 19. </p>

<p> (9) I am as guilty as any other scholar in the field, see
Richard F. Hamm, <i>Shaping the Eighteenth Amendment: Temperance
Reform, Legal Culture, and the Polity, 1880-1920</i> (Chapel
Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1995). We do not have a
good modern history of the Prohibition Party, though Blocker, <i>Retreat</i>
is a good start; similarily WCTU histories have tended to trail
off with Frances Willard's death. Where such narratives are to be
found are in the local studies of an area or region. Local
studies which have looked at the mechanics of the movement like
Robert L. Hampel, <i>Temperance and Prohibition in Massachusetts,
1813- 1852</i> (Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Research Press, 1982); have
often focused on areas that did not have significant outbreaks of
violence during temperance agitation. </p>

<p> (10) The only full length biolgraphies of Nation are old and
negative, Herbert Asbury, <i>Carry Nation</i> (New York: Knopf,
1929) and Robert Lewis Taylor, <i>Vessel of Wrath: The Life and
Times of Carry Nation</i> (New York: Signet Books, 1966). The
recent work by Robert Bader is more sympathic and connects her
clearly to events in Kansas. Robert S. Bader, &quot;Mrs.
Nation,&quot; <i>Kansas History</i> 7 (1984/5): 246-262; and <i>Prohibition,
</i>133-155. Nation is desperately in need of a biography which
could use the insights of women's history, gender relations, and
temperance studies to illuminate her career. The place to begin
such a reinterpretation of Nation is her autobiography, Carry A.
Nation, <i>The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation</i>
(Topeka, KA: F. M. Stevens and Sons, 1909). </p>

<h1>Hemp Around Their Necks</h1>

<p> From The Murderers </p>

<p> THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS </p>

<p> By HARRY J. ANSLINGER </p>

<p> U. S. Commissioner of Narcotics </p>

<p> and WILL OURSLER </p>

<p> FARRAR, STRAUS AND CUDAHY, NEW YORK, 1961 </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif"><br>
</p>

<p> In 1930 there was no federal law against smoking marijuana,
and the average American citizen in an average community had
probably never heard of &quot;reefers&quot; or &quot;tea&quot; or
other words in the argot of marijuana users. But by the middle
thirties we began to see the serious effects of marijuana on our
youth. An alarming increase in the smoking of marijuana reefers
in 1936 continued to spread at an accelerated pace in 1937.
Before this, use of reefers had been relatively slight and
confined to the the Southwest, particularly along the Mexican
border. </p>

<p> Seizures by state officers in these two years, however, had
increased a hundred percent and by hundreds of pounds. Reports I
received from thirty states showed an &quot;invasion&quot; by
this drug, either by cultivation or underworld importation. </p>

<p> Marijuana was something new and adventuresome. The angle-wise
mobsters were aiming their pitch straight at the most
impressionable age group-America's fresh, post-depression crop of
teenagers. </p>

<p> One adolescent gave a picture to an agent of a typical
&quot;smoker&quot; in an apartment or &quot;pad&quot;: </p>

<p> &quot;The room was crowded. There were fifty people but it
seemed like five hundred. It was like crazy, couples lying all,
over the place, a woman was screaming out in the hall, two,
fellows were trying to make love to the same girl and this, girl
was screaming and crying and not making any sense. Her clothes
were mostly pulled off and she was snickering and blubbering and
trying to push these two guys away.... The place was nothing but
smoke and stink and these funny little noises I could hear but
they were way out, that far I could hardly hear them and they
were right there in the room, that laughing and crying and the
music and all that stuff. It was crazy wild. But I didn't want to
do anything, I didn't want to sleep with those women or like
that. I just wanted to lie down because the room seemed big and
Eke a great tremendous crowd like at a ball game or something. .
. .&quot; </p>

<p> Made from the hemp plant known as Cannabis sativa americana,
marijuana is almost a twin brother to Cannabis sativa indica,
otherwise called hashish. There are said to be almost three
hundred names for the varieties of the hemp weed. In some parts
of Asia it is called bhang; in South Africa it is called dagga.
It is also challed chira and ganja. And many other names. </p>

<p> The hemp weed grows best in warm climates but has also been
found along roadsides north of Boston. It grows to heights of
from five and a half to fifteen or sixteen feet. Its leaves,
seeds and flowers contain a substance which when chewed or smoked
produces hallucinatory effects. </p>

<p> Elaborate technical processes have been developed for the
manufacture of Cannabis cigarettes from the resin in the plants.
Although pharmacists have never been able to isolate completely
the nature of the Cannabis &quot;principal&quot; that produces
the narcotic effect, it is known to exist in the fringes or hairs
on the leaves and in the flowers, and in the thick resin that
flows through the stalk and other parts of the plant. </p>

<p> Cannabis grows wild in many parts of the world, and is
cultivated in India, and illegally in certain areas of Africa,
Mexico, Brazil and the United States. It also grows wild in parts
of the United States, although we have been able to root the wild
Cannabis out of most communities. </p>

<p> Origins of hemp weed are ancient. Rites that go back
thousands of years, in temples long vanished, may wen have
evolved around the effects of some variant of the hemp weed.
Worshipers of the Hindu god Siva were said to use Cannabis
indica. In the eleventh century A.D., the Mohammedan sect called
the Assassins, used hashish in so-called religious observances.
They made homicide a high ritualistic art. Their name itself is
today a synonym for murder. </p>

<p> Marijuana effects on the average user are described in a
brochure we published in the Bureau for the information of lay
groups. &quot;The toxic effect produced by the active narcotic
principle of Cannabis sativa, hemp, or marijuana,&quot; the
report states, &quot;appear to be exclusively to the higher nerve
centers. The drug produces first an exhaltation with a feeling of
well being, a happy, jovial mood, usually; an increased feeling
of physical strength and power, and a general euphoria is
experienced. Accompanying this exaltation is a stimulation of the
imagination followed by a more or less delirious state
characterized by vivid kaleidoscopic visions, sometimes of a
pleasing sensual kind, but occasionally of a gruesome nature.
Accompanying this delirious state is a remarkable loss in spatial
and time relations; persons and things in the environment look
small; time is indeterminable; seconds seem like minutes and
hours like days. </p>

<p> &quot;Those who are accustomed to habitual use of the drug
are said eventually to develop a delirious rage after its
administration during which they are temporarily, at least,
irresponsible and prone to commit violent crimes. The prolonged
use of this narcotic is said to produce mental
deterioration.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the great difficulties with Cannabis is its
unpredictability. Physicians who have made hundreds of tests with
Cannabis report that there is no way to predict what effect it
have on the individual, both under controlled and noncontrolled
conditions. One man has no reaction at all; the next may go
berserk and try to stab somebody or harm himself. The medical
profession after many such experiments was forced to drop the
narcotic as a possible analgesic because of this unpredictable
quality. </p>

<p> Much of the most irrational juvenile violence and that has
written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is traceable directly
to this hemp intoxication. A gang of boys tear the clothes from
two school girls and rape the screaming girls, one boy after the
other. A sixteen-year-old kills his en tire family of five in
Florida, a man in Minnesota puts a bullet through the head of a
stranger on the road; in Colorado husband tries to shoot his
wife, kills her grandmother instead and then kills himself. Every
one of these crimes had been proceeded (sic) </p>

<p> by the smoking of one or more marijuana &quot;reefers.&quot;
As the marijuana situation grew worse, I knew action had to be
taken to get the proper legislation passed. By 1937 under my
direction, the Bureau launched two important steps First, a
legislative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would place
marijuana and its distribution directly under federal control.
Second, on radio and at major forums, such that presented
annually by the New York Herald Tribune, I told the story of this
evil weed of the fields and river beds and roadsides. I wrote
articles for magazines; our agents gave hundreds of lectures to
parents, educators, social and civic leaders. In network
broadcasts I reported on the growing list of crimes, including
murder and rape. I described the nature of marijuana and its
close kinship to hashish. I continued to hammer at the facts. </p>

<p> I believe we did a thorough job, for the public was alerted
and the laws to protect them were passed, both nationally and at
the state level. We also brought under control the wild growing
marijuana in this country. Working with local authorities, we
cleaned up hundreds of acres of marijuana we and uprooted plants
sprouting along the roadsides. </p>

<p> The 1937 law does not prohibit the sale of marijuana b puts a
tax of $100.00 an ounce on any sale or transfer of drug and makes
such sale or transfer illegal without proper registration and
approval from the Bureau. Possession without proper authorization
can bring a prison term. </p>

<p> The Marijuana Tax Act is patterned in general after the
Harrison Act, but with some major technical variations,
principally based on the fact that while marijuana is used in
laboratory tests it is not used for medical purposes. </p>

<p> There were still some WPA gangs working in those days and we
put them to good use. just outside the nation's capital, for some
sixty miles along the Potomac River, on both banks, marijuana was
growing in profusion; it had been planted there originally by
early settlers who made their own hemp and cloth. The workers
cleaned out tremendous river bank crops, destroying plants, seeds
and roots. AR through the Midwest also, WPA workers were used for
this clean-up job. The. wild hemp was rooted out of America. </p>

<p> During the Second World War, after Axis powers in the Far
East and Europe cut off our access to countries where hemp was
grown for the making of cord and cloth, we developed, under
strict controls, our own hemp growing program on the rich
farmlands of Minnesota. Less than one thousandth of one percent
was ever diverted into illegal channels. After the war this
production stopped and the fields went back to ,corn and wheat.
With the war's end, however, the narcotic branch of the
underworld was given a new lift by the publication of an
extraordinary document which has come to be known as the La
Guardia Report. </p>

<p> The title was a misnomer, it was actually a report of a
committee on marijuana which had been appointed by the
&quot;Little Flower&quot; of New York to give an objective
picture of marijuana from a scientific point of view. La Guardia
was always not only an honest official who warred against the
syndicate &quot;tin horns,&quot; as he called them, but was also
a good friend of Bureau of Narcotics. In Congress he fought
consistently for increases for our Bureau to help us to achieve
the power needed to do our job. </p>

<p> The men who issued this document were men of science doctors,
technicians, authorities Published as a book by the Jacques
Cattell Press in 1945, the report bore the tide: The Marijuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociologic Medical,
Psychological and Pharmacological Studies, by the Mayor's
Committee on Marijuana. </p>

<p> This report declared, in effect, that those who had been
denouncing marijuana as dangerous, including myself and experts
in the Bureau, were not only in error, but were spreading
baseless fears about the effects of smoking Cannabis. I say the
report was a government printed invitation to youth and
adults-above all to teenagers-to go ahead and smoke all the
reefers they felt like. </p>

<p> Relying solely on a series of experiments with a group of 77
prisoners who volunteered to make the tests, the Mayor's experts
asserted that they found no major menace in the use of this
narcotic, which they termed &quot;a mild drug smoked by bored
people for the sake of conviviality.&quot; </p>

<p> The report further claimed that there was &quot;no
apparent&quot; connection between &quot;the weed&quot; and crimes
of violence, that smoking it did not produce aggressiveness or
belligerence as a rule, that it could be used for a number of
years without causing serious mental or physical harm and that
while it might be habit forming it could be given up abruptly
without causing distress; in other words, it did not produce the
bodily dependence found in heroin, cocaine, morphine and other
drugs. </p>

<p> Finally, the report suggested that the drug is so mild that
it might well be used successfully as a substitute in the process
of curing addiction to other drugs, or even in the treatment of
chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p> Doctors and other authorities who studied the effects of this
drug, however, tore the report apart for its inaccuracies and
misleading conclusions. The Journal of the American Medical
Association joined the. Bureau in condemning it as unscientific. </p>

<p> &quot;For many years medical scientists have considered
Cannabis a dangerous drug,&quot; the Journal's editorial of April
26, 1945 stated. &quot;Nevertheless. . . . the Mayor's Committee
on Marijuana submits an analysis by seventeen doctors of tests on
77 prisoners and, on this narrow and thoroughly unscientific
foundation, draws sweeping and inadequate conclusions which
minimize the harmlessness of marijuana. Already the book has done
harm. One investigator has described some tearful parents who
brought their 16-year-old boy to a physician after he had been
detected in the act of smoking marijuana. . . . The boy said he
had read an account of the La Guardia committee report and this
was his justification for using marijuana.. </p>

<p> A criminal lawyer for marijuana drug peddlers has already
used the La Guardia report as a basis to have defendants set free
by the Court. </p>

<p> &quot;The value of the conclusions,&quot; continued the
editorial, &quot;is destroyed by the fact that the experiments
were conducted on 77 confined criminals. Prisoners were obliged
to be content with the quantities of drug administered.
Antisocial behavior could not have been noticed, as they were
prisoners. At liberty some of them would have given free rein to
their inclinations and would probably not have stopped at the
dose producing 'the pleasurable principle. . . .' Public
officials will do well to disregard this unscientific, uncritical
study, and continue to regard marijuana as a menace where it is
purveyed,&quot; the Journal concluded. </p>

<p> There can be no doubt of the damage done by the report.
Syndicate lawyers and spokesmen leaped upon its giddy sociology
and medical mumbo-jumbo, cited it in court cases, tried to spread
the idea that the report had brought marijuana back into the
folds of good society with a full pardon and a slap on the back
front the medical profession. </p>

<p> The lies continued to spread. They cropped up on panel
discussions, in public addresses by seemingly informed
individuals. They helped once again, in a new and profitable
direction, to bewilder the public and make it unsure of its own
judgments. This carefully nurtured public doubt was to pay off
with extra millions in the pockets of the hoods. One killer who
helped to nourish that doubt-a hoodlum called Lepke took a
multi-million-dollar cut in exchange for the terror inspired by
the mere mention of his name.<br>

<h1>Confessions of an English Opium Eater </h1>

<p> <b>by Thomas de Quincey</b> </p>

<p> <b>THE PLEASURES OF OPIUM</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> It is so long since I first took opium, that if it had been a
trifling incident in my life, I might have forgotten its date:
but cardinal events are not to be forgotten; and from
circumstances connected with it, I remember that it must be
referred to the autumn of 1804. During that season I was in
London, having come thither for the first time since my entrance
at college. </p>

<p> And my introduction to opium arose in the following way. From
an early age I had been accustomed to wash my head in cold water
at least once a day: being suddenly seized with toothache, I
attributed it to some relaxation caused by an accidental
intermission of that practice; jumped out of bed; plunged my head
into a basin of cold water; and with hair thus wetted went to
sleep. </p>

<p> The next morning, as I need hardly say, I awoke with
excruciating rheumatic pains of the head and face, from which I
had hardly any respite for about twenty days. On the twenty-first
day, I think it was, and on a Sunday, that I went out into the
streets; rather to run away, if possible, from my torments, than
with any distinct purpose. By accident I met a college
acquaintance who recommended opium. Opium! dread agent of
unimaginable pleasure and pain! I had heard of it as I had of
manna or of Ambrosia, but no further: how unmeaning a sound was
it at that time! what solemn chords does it now strike upon my
heart! what heart-quaking vibrations of sad and happy
remembrances! Reverting for a moment to these, I feel a mystic
importance attached to the minutest circumstances connected with
the place and the time, and the man (if man he was) that first
laid open to me the Paradise of Opium-eaters. It was a Sunday
afternoon, wet and cheerless: and a duller spectacle this earth
of ours has not to show than a rainy Sunday in London. My road
homewards lay through Oxford-street; and near &quot;the /stately/
Pantheon,&quot; (as Mr. Wordsworth has obligingly called it) I
saw a druggist's shop. The druggist -- unconscious minister of
celestial pleasures! -- as if in sympathy with the rainy Sunday,
looked dull and stupid, just as any mortal druggist might be
expected to look on a Sunday; and, when I asked for the tincture
of opium, he gave it to me as any other man might do: and
furthermore, out of my shilling, returned me what seemed to be
real copper halfpence, taken out of a real wooden drawer.
Nevertheless, in spite of such indications of humanity, he has
ever since existed in my mind as the beatific vision of an
immortal druggist, sent down to earth on a special mission to
myself. And it confirms me in this way of considering him, that,
when I next came up to London, I sought him near the stately
Pantheon, and found him not: and thus to me, who knew not his
name (if indeed he had one) he seemed rather to have vanished
from Oxford-street than to have removed in any bodily fashion.
The reader may choose to think of him as, possibly, no more than
a sublunary druggist: it may be so: but my faith is better: I
believe him to have evanesced,{1} or evaporated. So unwillingly
would I connect any mortal remembrances with that hour, and
place, and creature, that first brought me acquainted with the
celestial drug. </p>

<p> Arrived at my lodgings, it may be supposed that I lost not a
moment in taking the quantity prescribed. I was necessarily
ignorant of the whole art and mystery of opium-taking: and, what
I took, I took under every disadvantage. But I took it: -- and in
an hour, oh! Heavens! what a revulsion! what an upheaving, from
its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what an apocalypse of the
world within me! That my pains had vanished, was now a trifle in
my eyes: -- this negative effect was swallowed up in the
immensity of those positive effects which had opened before me --
in the abyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed. Here was
a panacea - a [pharmakon nepenthez] for all human woes: here was
the secret of happiness, about which philosophers had disputed
for so many ages, at once discovered: happiness might now be
bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket: portable
ecstasies might be had corked up in a pint bottle: and peace of
mind could be sent down in gallons by the mail coach. But, if I
talk in this way, the reader will think I am laughing: and I can
assure him, that nobody will laugh long who deals much with
opium: its pleasures even are of a grave and solemn complexion;
and in his happiest state, the opium-eater cannot present himself
in the character of /Il Allegro/: even then, he speaks and thinks
as becomes /Il Penseroso/. Nevertheless, I have a very
reprehensible way of jesting at times in the midst of my own
misery: and, unless when I am checked by some more powerful
feelings, I am afraid I shall be guilty of this indecent practice
even in these annals of suffering or enjoyment. The reader must
allow a little to my infirm nature in this respect: and with a
few indulgences of that sort, I shall endeavour to be as grave,
if not drowsy, as fits a theme like opium, so anti-mercurial as
it really is, and so drowsy as it is falsely reputed. </p>

<p> And, first, one word with respect to its bodily effects: for
upon all that has been hitherto written on the subject of opium,
whether by travelers in Turkey (who may plead their privilege of
lying as an old immemorial right), or by professors of medicine,
writing /ex cathedra/, -- I have but one emphatic criticism to
pronounce -- Lies! lies! lies! I remember once, in passing a
book-stall, to have caught these words from a page of some
satiric author: -- &quot;By this time I became convinced that the
London newspapers spoke truth at least twice a week, viz. on
Tuesday and Saturday, and might safely be depended upon for --
the list of bankrupts.&quot; In like manner, I do by no means
deny that some truths have been delivered to the world in regard
to opium: thus it has been repeatedly affirmed by the learned,
that opium is a dusky brown in colour; and this, take notice, I
grant: secondly, that it is rather dear; which I also grant: for
in my time, East-India opium has been three guineas a pound, and
Turkey eight: and, thirdly, that if you eat a good deal of it,
most probably you must -- do what is particularly disagreeable to
any man of regular habits, viz. die.{2} These weighty
propositions are, all and singular, true: I cannot gainsay them:
and truth ever was, and will be, commendable. But in these three
theorems, I believe we have exhausted the stock of knowledge as
yet accumulated by man on the subject of opium. And therefore,
worthy doctors, as there seems to be room for further
discoveries, stand aside, and allow me to come forward and
lecture on this matter. </p>

<p> First, then, it is not so much affirmed as taken for granted,
by all who ever mention opium, formally or incidentally, that it
does, or can, produce intoxication. Now reader, assure yourself,
/meo periculo/, that no quantity of opium ever did, or could
intoxicate. As to the tincture of opium (commonly called
laudanum) /that/ might certainly intoxicate if a man could bear
to take enough of it; but why? because it contains so much proof
spirit, and not because it contains so much opium. But crude
opium, I affirm peremptorily, is incapable of producing any state
of body at all resembling that which is produced by alcohol; and
not in /degree/ only incapable, but even in /kind/: it is not in
the quantity of its effects merely, but in the quality, that it
differs altogether. The pleasure given by wine is always
mounting, and tending to a crisis, after which it declines: that
from opium, when once generated, is stationary for eight or ten
hours: the first, to borrow a technical distinction from
medicine, is a case of acute - the second, of chronic pleasure:
the one is a flame, the other a steady and equable glow. But the
main distinction lies in this, that whereas wine disorders the
mental faculties, opium, on the contrary (if taken in a proper
manner), introduces amongst them the most exquisite order,
legislation, and harmony. Wine robs a man of his self possession:
opium greatly invigorates it. Wine unsettles and clouds the
judgment, and gives a preternatural brightness, and a vivid
exaltation to the contempts and the admirations, the loves and
the hatreds, of the drinker: opium, on the contrary, communicates
serenity and equipoise to all the faculties, active or passive:
and with respect to the temper and moral feelings in general, it
gives simply that sort of vital warmth which is approved by the
judgment, and which would probably always accompany a bodily
constitution of primeval or antediluvian health. Thus, for
instance, opium, like wine, gives an expansion to the heart and
the benevolent affections: but then, with this remarkable
difference, that in the sudden development of kind-heartedness
which accompanies inebriation, there is always more or less of a
maudlin character, which exposes it to the contempt of the
by-stander. Men shake hands, swear eternal friendship, and shed
tears -- no mortal knows why: and the sensual creature is clearly
uppermost. But the expansion of the benigner feelings, incident
to opium, is no febrile access, but a healthy restoration to that
state which the mind would naturally recover upon the removal of
any deep- seated irritation of pain that had disturbed and
quarrelled with the impulses of a heard originally just and good.
True it is, that even wine, up to a certain point, and with
certain men, rather tends to exalt and to steady the intellect: I
myself, who have never been a great wine-drinker, used to find
that half a dozen glasses of wine advantageously affected the
faculties -- brightened and intensified the consciousness -- and
gave to the mind a feeling of being &quot;ponderibus librata
suis:&quot; and certainly it is most absurdly said, in popular
language, of any man, that he is /disguised/ in liquor: for, on
the contrary, most men are disguised by sobriety; and it is when
they are drinking (as some old gentleman says in Athenaeus), that
men [eantonz emfanixondin oitinez eidin]. -- display themselves
in their true complexion of character; which surely is not
disguising themselves. But still, wine constantly leads a man to
the brink of absurdity and extravagance; and, beyond a certain
point, it is sure to volatilize and to disperse the intellectual
energies: whereas opium always seems to compose what had been
agitated, and to concentrate what had been distracted. In short,
to sum up all in one word, a man who is inebriated, or tending to
inebriation, is, and feels that he is, in a condition which calls
up into supremacy the merely human, too often the brutal, part of
his nature: but the opium-eater (I speak of him who is not
suffering from any disease, or other remote effects of opium)
feels that the diviner part of his nature is paramount; that is,
the moral affections are in a state of cloudless serenity; and
over all is the great light of the majestic intellect. </p>

<p> This is the doctrine of the true church on the subject of
opium: of which church I acknowledge myself to be the only member
-- the alpha and the omega: but then it is to be recollected,
that I speak from the ground of a large and profound personal
experience: whereas most of the unscientific{3} authors who have
at all treated of opium, and even of those who have written
expressly on the materia medica, make it evident, from the horror
they express of it, that their experimental knowledge of its
action is none at all. I will, however, candidly acknowledge that
I have met with one person who bore evidence to its intoxicating
power, such as staggered my own incredulity: for he was a
surgeon, and had himself taken opium largely. I happened to say
to him, that his enemies (as I had heard) charged him with
talking nonsense on politics, and that his friends apologized for
him, by suggesting that he was constantly in a state of
intoxication from opium. Now the accusation, said I, is not
/prima facie/, and of necessity, an absurd one: but the defence
/is/. To my surprise, however, he insisted that both his enemies
and his friends were in the right: &quot;I will maintain,&quot;
said he, &quot;that I /do/ talk nonsense; and secondly, I will
maintain that I do not talk nonsense upon principle, or with any
view to profit, but solely and simply, said he, solely and
simply, -- solely and simply (repeating it three times over),
because I am drunk with opium; and /that/ daily.&quot; I replied
that, as to the allegation of his enemies, as it seemed to be
established upon such respectable testimony, seeing that the
three parties concerned all agreed in it, it did not become me to
question it; but the defence set up I must demur to. He proceeded
to discuss the matter, and to lay down his reasons: but it seemed
to me so impolite to pursue an argument which must have presumed
a man mistaken in a point belonging to his own profession, that I
did not press him even when his course of argument seemed open to
objection: not to mention that a man who talks nonsense, even
though &quot;with no view to profit,&quot; is not altogether the
most agreeable partner in a dispute, whether as opponent or
respondent. I confess, however, that the authority of a surgeon,
and one who was reputed a good one, may seem a weighty one to my
prejudice: but still I must plead my experience, which was
greater than his greatest by 7000 drops a day; and, though it was
not possible to suppose a medical man unacquainted with the
characteristic symptoms of vinous intoxication, it yet struck me
that he might proceed on a logical error of using the word
intoxication with too great latitude, and extending it
generically to all modes of nervous excitement, connected with
certain diagnostics. Some people have maintained, in my hearing,
that they had been drunk on green tea: and a medical student in
London, for whose knowledge in his profession I have reason to
feel great respect, assured me, the other day, that a patient, in
recovering from an illness, had got drunk on a beef-steak. </p>

<p> Having dwelt so much on this first and leading error, in
respect to opium, I shall notice very briefly a second and a
third; which are, that the elevation of spirits produced by opium
is necessarily followed by a proportionate depression, and that
the natural and even immediate consequence of opium is torpor and
stagnation, animal and mental. The first of these errors I shall
content myself with simply denying; assuring my reader, that for
ten years, during which I took opium at intervals, the day
succeeding to that on which I allowed myself this luxury was
always a day of unusually good spirits. </p>

<p> With respect to the torpor supposed to follow, or rather (if
we were to credit the numerous pictures of Turkish opium-eaters)
to accompany the practice of opium-eating, I deny that also.
Certainly, opium is classed under the head of narcotics; and some
such effect it may produce in the end: but the primary effects of
opium are always, and in the highest degree, to excite and
stimulate the system: this first stage of its action always
lasted with me, during my novitiate, for upwards of eight hours;
so that it must be the fault of the opium-eater himself if he
does not so time his exhibition of the dose (to speak medically)
as that the whole weight of its narcotic influence may descend
upon his sleep. Turkish opium-eaters, it seems, are absurd enough
to sit, like so many equestrian statues, on logs of wood as
stupid as themselves. But that the reader may judge of the degree
in which opium is likely to stupify the faculties of an
Englishman, I shall (by way of treating the question
illustratively, rather than argumentively) describe the way in
which I myself often passed an opium evening in London, during
the period between 1804-1812. It will be seen, that at least
opium did not move me to seek solitude, and much less to seek
inactivity, or the torpid state of self- involution ascribed to
the Turks. I give this account at the risk of being pronounced a
crazy enthusiast or visionary: but I regard /that/ little: I must
desire my reader to bear in mind, that I was a hard student, and
at severe studies for all the rest of my time: and certainly had
a right occasionally to relaxations as well as the other people:
these, however, I allowed myself but seldom. </p>

<p> The late Duke of Norfolk used to say, &quot;Next Friday, by
the blessing of Heaven, I purpose to be drunk:&quot; and in like
manner I used to fix beforehand how often, within a given time,
and when, I would commit a debauch of opium. This was seldom more
than once in three weeks: for at that time I could no have
ventured to call every day (as I did afterwards) for &quot;/a
glass of laudanum negus, warm, and without sugar/.&quot; No: as I
have said, I seldom drank laudanum, at that time, more than once
in three weeks: this was usually on a Tuesday or a Saturday
night; my reason for which was this. In those days Grassini sang
at the Opera: and her voice was delightful to me beyond all that
I had ever heard. I know not what may be the state of the Opera-
house now, having never been within its walls for seven or eight
years, but at that time it was by much the most pleasant place of
public resort in London for passing an evening. Five shillings
admitted one to the gallery, which was subject to far less
annoyance than the pit of the theatres: the orchestra was
distinguished by its sweet and melodious grandeur from all
English orchestras, the composition of which, I confess, is not
acceptable to my ear, from the predominance of the clangorous
instruments, and the absolute tyranny of the violin. The choruses
were divine to hear: and when Grassini appeared in some
interlude, as she often did, and poured forth her passionate soul
as Andromache, at the tomb of Hector, &amp;c. I question whether
any Turk, of all that ever entered the Paradise of opium-eaters,
can have had half the pleasure I had. But, indeed, I honour the
Barbarians too much by supposing them capable of any pleasures
approaching to the intellectual ones of an Englishman. For music
is an intellectual or a sensual pleasure, according to the
temperament of him who hears it. And, by the bye, with the
exception of the fine extravaganza on that subject in Twelfth
Night, I do not recollect more than one thing said adequately on
the subject of music in all literature: it is a passage in the
/Religio Medici/{4} of Sir T. Brown; and, though chiefly
remarkable for its sublimity, has also a philosophic value,
inasmuch as it points to the true theory of musical effects. The
mistake of most people is to suppose that it is by the ear they
communicate with music, and, therefore, that they are purely
passive to its effects. But this is not so: it is by the
re-action of the mind upon the notices of the ear, (the /matter/
coming by the senses, the /form/ from the mind) that the pleasure
is constructed: and therefore it is that people of equally good
ear differ so much in this point from one another. Now opium, by
greatly increasing the activity of the mind generally, increases,
of necessity, that particular mode of its activity by which we
are able to construct out of the raw material of organic sound an
elaborate intellectual pleasure. But, says a friend, a succession
of musical sounds is to me like a collection of Arabic
characters: </p>

<p> I can attach no ideas to them. Ideas! my good sir? there is
no occasion for them: all that class of ideas, which can be
available in such a case, has a language of representative
feelings. But this is a subject foreign to my present purposes:
it is sufficient to say, that a chorus, &amp;c. of elaborate
harmony, displayed before me, as in a piece of arras work, the
whole of my past life -- not, as if recalled by an act of memory,
but as if present and incarnated in the music: no longer painful
to dwell upon: but the detail of its incidents removed, or
blended in some hazy abstraction; and its passions exalted,
spiritualized, and sublimed. All this was to be had for five
shillings. And over and above the music of the stage and the
orchestra, I had all around me, in the intervals of the
performance, the music of the Italian language talked by Italian
women: for the gallery was usually crowded with Italians: and I
listened with a pleasure such as that with which Weld the
traveller lay and listened, in Canada, to the sweet laughter of
Indian women; for the less you understand of a language, the more
sensible you are to the melody or harshness of its sounds: for
such a purpose, therefore, it was an advantage to me that I was a
poor Italian scholar, reading it but little, and not speaking it
at all, nor understanding a tenth part of what I heard spoken. </p>

<p> These were my Opera pleasures: but another pleasure I had
which, as it could be had only on a Saturday night, occasionally
struggled with my love of the Opera; for, at that time, Tuesday
and Saturday were the regular Opera nights. On this subject I am
afraid I shall be rather obscure, but, I can assure the reader,
not at all more so than Marinus in his life of Proclus, or many
other biographers and auto-biographers of fair reputation. This
pleasure, I have said, was to be had only on a Saturday night.
What then was Saturday night to me more than any other night? I
had no labours that I rested from; no wages to receive: what
needed I to care for Saturday night, more than as it was a
summons to hear Grassini? True, most logical reader: what you say
is unanswerable. And yet so it was and is, that, whereas
different men throw their feelings into different channels, and
most are apt to show their interest in the concerns of the poor,
chiefly by sympathy, expressed in some shape or other, with their
distresses and sorrows, I, at that time, was disposed to express
my interest by sympathising with their pleasures. The pains of
poverty I had lately seen too much of; more than I wished to
remember: but the pleasures of the poor, their consolations of
spirit, and their reposes from bodily toil, can never become
oppressive to contemplate. </p>

<p> Now Saturday night is the season for the chief, regular, and
periodic return of rest to the poor: in this point the most
hostile sects unite, and acknowledge a common link of
brotherhood: almost all Christendom rests from its labours. It is
a rest introductory to another rest: and divided by a whole day
and two nights from the renewal of toil. On this account I feel
always, on a Saturday night, as though I also were released from
some yoke of labour, had some wages to receive, and some luxury
of repose to enjoy. For the sake, therefore, of witnessing, upon
as large a scale as possible, a spectacle with which my sympathy
was so entire, I used often, on Saturday nights, after I had
taken opium, to wander forth, without much regarding the
direction or the distance, to all the markets, and other parts of
London, to which the poor resort on a Saturday night, for laying
out their wages. Many a family party, consisting of a man, his
wife, and sometimes one or two of his children, have I listened
to, as they stood consulting on their ways and means, or the
strength of their exchequer, or the price of household articles.
Gradually I became familiar with their wishes, their
difficulties, and their opinions. Sometimes there might be heard
murmurs of discontent: but far oftener expressions on the
countenance, or uttered in words, of patience, hope, and
tranquility. And taken generally, I must say, that, in this point
at least, the poor are far more philosophic than the rich - that
they show a more ready and cheerful submission to what they
consider as irremediably evils, or irreparable losses. Whenever I
saw occasion, or could do it without appearing to be intrusive, I
joined their parties; and gave my opinion upon the matter in
discussion, which, if not always judicious, was always received
indulgently. If wages were a little higher, or expected to be so,
or the quartern loaf a little lower, or it was reported that
onions and butter were expected to fall, I was glad: yet, if the
contrary were true, I drew from opium some means of consoling
myself. For opium (like the bee, that extracts its materials
indiscriminately from roses and from the soot of chimneys) can
overrule all feelings into a compliance with the master key. </p>

<p> Some of these rambles led me to great distances: for an
opium-eater is too happy to observe the motion of time. And
sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical
principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking
ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating
all the capes and head-lands I had doubled in my outward voyage,
I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such
enigmatical entries, and such sphynx's riddles of streets without
thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of
porters, and confound the intellects of hackney- coachmen. I
could almost have believed, at times, that I must be the first
discoverer of some of these /terrae incognitae/, and doubted,
whether they had yet been aid down in the modern charts of
London. For all this, however, I paid a heavy price in distant
years, when the human face tyrannized over my dreams, and the
perplexities of my steps in London came back and haunted my
sleep, with the feeling of perplexities moral or intellectual,
that brought confusion to the reason, or anguish and remorse to
the conscience. </p>

<p> Thus I have shown that opium does not, of necessity, produce
inactivity or torpor; but that, on the contrary, it often led me
into markets and theatres. Yet, in candour, I will admit that
markets and theatres are not the appropriate haunts of the
opium-eater, when in the divinest state incident to his
enjoyment. In that state, crowds become an oppression to him;
music even, too sensual and gross. He naturally seeks solitude
and silence, as indispensable conditions of those trances, or
profoundest reveries, which are the crown and consummation of
what opium can do for human nature. I, whose disease it was to
meditate too much, and to observe too little, and who, upon my
first entrance at college, was nearly falling into a deep
melancholy, from brooding too much on the sufferings which I had
witnessed in London, was sufficiently aware of the tendencies of
my own thoughts to do all I could to counteract them. -- I was,
indeed, like a person who, according to the old legend, had
entered the cave of Trophonius: and the remedies I sought were to
force myself into society, and to keep my understanding in
continual activity upon matters of science. But for these
remedies, I should certainly have become hypochondriacally
melancholy. In after years, however, when my cheerfulness was
more fully re-established, I yielded to my natural inclination
for a solitary life. And, at that time, I often fell into these
reveries upon taking opium; and more than once it has happened to
me, on a summer-night, when I have been at an open window, in a
room from which I could overlook the sea at a mile below me, and
could command a view of the great town of Liverpool, at about the
same distance, that I have sate, from sun-set to sun-rise,
motionless, and without wishing to move. </p>

<p> I shall be charged with mysticism, behmenism, quietism,
&amp;c. but /that/ shall not alarm me. Sir H. Vane, the younger,
was one of our wisest men: and let my readers see if he, in his
philosophical works, be half as unmystical as I am. -- I say,
then, that it has often struck me that the scene itself was
somewhat typical of what took place in such a reverie. The town
of Liverpool represented the earth, with its sorrows and its
graves left behind, yet not out of sight, nor wholly forgotten.
The ocean, in everlasting but gentle agitation, and brooded over
by a dove-like calm, might not unfitly typify the mind and the
mood which then swayed it. For it seemed to me as if then first I
stood at a distance, and aloof from the uproar of life; as if the
tumult, the fever, and the strife, were suspended; a respite
granted from the secret burthens of the heart; a sabbath of
repose; a resting from human labours. Here were the hopes which
blossom in the paths of life, reconciled with the peace which is
in the grave; motions of the intellect as unwearied as the
heavens, yet for all anxieties a halcyon calm: a tranquility that
seemed no product of inertia, but as if resulting from mighty and
equal antagonisms; infinite activities, infinite repose. </p>

<p> Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of
poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for
&quot;the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,&quot; bringest
and assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric
stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for
one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed
pure from blood; and to the proud man, a brief oblivion for
Wrongs unredress'd, and insults unavenged; that summonest to the
chancery of dreams, for the triumphs of suffering innocence,
false witnesses; and confoundest perjury; and dost reverse the
sentences of unrighteous judges: -- thou buildest upon the bosom
of darkness, out of the fantastic imagery of the brain, cities
and temples, beyond the art of Phidias and Praxiteles -- beyond
the splendour of Babylon and Hekatompylos: and &quot;from the
anarchy of dreaming sleep,&quot; callest into sunny light the
faces of long-buried beauties, and the blessed household
countenances, cleansed from the &quot;dishonours of the
grave.&quot; Thou only givest these gifts to man; and thou hast
the keys of Paradise, oh, just, subtle, and mighty opium! </p>

<p> ----- </p>

<p> {1} /Evanesced:/ -- this way of going off the stage of life
appears to have been well known in the 17th century, but at the
time to have been considered a peculiar privilege of blood-royal,
and by no means to be allowed to druggists. For about the year
1686, a poet of rather ominous name (and who, by the bye, did
ample justice to his name), viz. Mr. Flat-man, in speaking of the
death of Charles II. expresses his surprise that any prince
should commit so absurd an act as dying; because, says he, </p>

<p> Kings should disdain to die, and only /disappear./ </p>

<p> They should /abscond/, that is, into the other world. </p>

<p> {2} Of this, however, the learned appear latterly to have
doubted: for in a pirated edition of Buchan's /Domestic
Medicine/, which I once saw in the hands of a farmer's wife who
was studying it for the benefit of her health, the Doctor was
made to say -- &quot;Be particularly careful never to take above
five- and-twenty /ounces/ of laudanum at once;&quot; the true
reading being probably five- and-twenty /drops/, which are held
equal to about one grain of crude opium. </p>

<p> {3} Amongst the great herd of travellers, &amp;c. who show
sufficiently by their stupidity that they never held any
intercourse with opium, I must caution my readers especially
against the brilliant author of /&quot;Anastasius.&quot;/ This
gentleman, whose wit would lead one to presume him an
opium-eater, has made it impossible to consider him in that
character from the grievous misrepresenta-tion which he gives of
its effects, at pp. 215-17, of vol. I. - Upon consideration it
must appear such to the author himself: for, waiving the errors I
have insisted on in the text, which (and others) are adopted in
the fullest manner, he will himself admit, that an old gentleman
&quot;with a snow-white beard,&quot; who eats &quot;ample doses
of opium,&quot; and is yet able to deliver what is meant and
received as very weighty counsel on the bad effects of that
practice, is but an indifferent evidence that opium either kills
people prematurely, or sends them into a madhouse. But, for my
part, I see into this old gentleman and his motives: the fact is,
he was enamoured of &quot;the little golden receptacle of the
pernicious drug&quot; which Anastasius carried about him; and no
way of obtaining it so safe and so feasible occurred, as that of
frightening its owner out of his wits (which, by the bye, are
none of the strongest). This commentary throws a new light upon
the case, and greatly improves it as a story: for the old
gentleman's speech, considered as a lecture on pharmacy, is
highly absurd: but, considered as a hoax on Anastasius, it reads
excellently. </p>

<p> {4} I have not the book at this moment to consult: but I
think the passage begins -- &quot;And even that tavern music,
which makes one man merry, another mad, in me strikes a deep fit
of devotion,&quot; &amp;c. <br>

<p> Another important claimant for credit in bringing about the
legislation was a young Conservative in Vancouver, H. H. Stevens.
Stevens became a very vocal MP during the narcotics debates of
the 1920s, and personally introduced several important
amendments. His zeal for narcotic drug prohibition was kindled
during his early investigations of the problem. </p>

<p> According to his own account, when he learned about the
gambling and opium trade being carried on in Vancouver's
Chinatown, he took the following actions: </p>

<p> I took it up with the Chief of Police, but he just brushed me
off. Then I went down into Chinatown itself, and visited the
gambling joints and also saw personally the Chinese preparing raw
opium for the market. When the Chief of Police refused to take
any action, I used to publish in the _Vancouver News Advertiser_
exactly what I had seen the night before. This I did for several
weeks. It created quite a sensation in Vancouver, and as a result
the civic authorities discharged the Chief and appointed Mr.
Chamberlain. This man, when he became Chief of Police, did an
excellent job in clearing up Chinatown(29). </p>

<p> He described his role in bringing about the first opium Act
as follows: </p>

<p> (In 1908) I was responsible for the matter being brought to
the attention of the then government. I remember taking some very
prominent eastern gentlemen around Pacific Coast cities and
showing them the effects and use of these drugs. They returned to
Ottawa and put it up to Sir Wilfred Laurier, and the result was
the Bill that was introduced(13d,p.2899). </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The motives of H. H. Stevens and of the city councils are
open to question. They appear in this instance to have been
concerned about moral reform and civic order but all were
associated with anti-Chinese policies in other contexts. Stevens
came to be recognized as the &quot;the city's leading
anti-Oriental spokesman&quot; (30, p.91), in Parliament as at
local rallies. Civic politicians, too, had an anti-Chinese
rhetoric as part of their election kit and, once elected, usually
supported the use of municipal ordinances and licensing powers
for discriminatory purposes. </p>

<p> &lt;SNIP&gt; </p>

<p> The League's (Vancouver Anti-Opium League) representations to
King(Mackenzie) included an urgent telegram at the time when the
Bill was being sent to the Senate and the opium manufacturers
were lobbying for a moratorium to protect their financial
interests. </p>

<p> INFORM GOVERNMENT NOT TO LET MANUFACTURERS DELAY LEGISTAION.
CHINESE AT LARGE FAVOUR IMMEDIATE SUPPRESSION(2d). </p>

<p> &lt;End pgs 66-68&gt; </p>

<p> &lt;Begin pg 203&gt; </p>

<p> THE PUBLIC </p>

<p> Interested sections of the public became very vocal and
active during the same period in in demanding more severe
penalties. The cry for heavier punishment was the result of a
drug scare created almost entirely by alarmist stories in the
mass media. The stories, of which Emily Murphy's articles in
_Maclean's_ were a prime example, reinforced pre-existing
hostility to Orientals and augmented the horrifying spectre of
the &quot;dope fiend.&quot; The negative racial stereotypes and
alarming drug mythology, spread by people who claimed to have
first-hand knowledge, were accepted uncritically. The immediate
result of these fears and hostility was the emergence of a
British Columbia drug lobby in 1921, with the straightforward
goals of compulsory imprisonment and whipping for all traffickers
and, where possible, deportation. Public fears about narcotic
drugs were particularly intense in British Columbia, the province
with the largest concentration of Chinese immigrants.
Accordingly, the greatest pressure on legislators for severe
penalties originated in that province. Much of the demand for
greater punitiveness was linked to animus against the Chinese and
a desire to get rid of them, seen most clearly in the proposal
for deportation. </p>

<p><font size="4">What Shall They Do to Be Saved?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have just returned from forty-eight hours'
friendly and professional attendance at a bedside where I would
fain place every young person in this country for a single hour
before the Responsibilities of Life have become the sentinels and
Habit the jailor of his Will.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">My patient was a gentleman of forty, who for
several years of his youth occasionally used opium, and, for the
last eight has habitually taken it. During these eight years he
has made at least three efforts to leave it off, in each instance
diminishing his dose gradually for a month before its entire
abandonment, and in the most successful one holding the enemy at
bay but for a single summer. In two cases he had no respite of
agony from the moment he dropped till he resumed it. In the third
case, a short period of comparative repose succeeded the first
fiery battle, but in the midst of felicitations on his victory he
was attacked by the most agonizing hemicranial headaches
(resulting from what I now fear to have been already permanent
disorganization of the stomach), and went back to his nepenthe in
a state of almost suicidal despair, only after the torture had
continued for weeks without a moment's mitigation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He had first learned its seductions, as happens
with the vast majority of Anglo-Saxon opium-eaters, through a
medical prescription. An attack of inflamed cornea was treated
with caustic applications, and the pian assuaged by internal
doses of M'Munn's Elixir. When my friend came out of his dark
room and bandages at the end of a month he had consumed twenty
ounces of this preparation, whose probable distinction from the
tincture known as laudanum I point out below in the note. [FN*]</font></p>

<p><font size="3">________</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Mr. Frank A. Schlitz has kindly made for me a
special analysis of M'Munn's Elixir which seems to prove that the
process of its preparation amounts to more than the
denarcotization of opium, which is spoken of on the wrapper of
each vial. As nearly as can be ascertained, M'Munn's Elixir is
simply an aqueous infusion of opium--procured by the ordinary
maceration--and preserved from decomposing by the subsequent
addition of a small portion of alcohol. Narcotin being absolutely
insoluble in water is eliminated as the circular says. This face
along would not account for the difference between its action and
that of laudanum. This is explained by the fact that all the
other alkaloids possess diverse rates of solubility in water, and
exist in M'Munn's Elixir in very different relative proportions
from those which they bear to each other in the alcoholic
tincture called laudanum. _____</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Here it may not be superfluous to say that the
former preparation has all the essential properties of the
latter, save certain of the constipatory and stupefying
tendencies which, by a private process known to the assigns of
the inventor, have been so masked or removed that it possesses in
many cases an availableness which the practitioner can not
despise, though compelled by the secrecy of its formula to rank
it among quack medicines. The amount of it which my friend had
taken during this month's eclipse represents an ounce of dry gum
opium--in rough measurement a piece as large as a French billiard
ball. I thus particularize because he had never previously been
addicted to the drug; had inherited a sound constitution, and
differed from any other fresh subject only in the intensity of
his nervous temperament. I wish to emphasize the fact that the
system of a mere neophyte, with nothing to neutralize the effects
of the drug save the absorbency, so to speak, of the pain from
which it was given, could so rapidly adapt itself to them as to
demand an increase of the dose in such an alarming ratio. There
are certain men to whom opium is as fire to tow, and my friend
was one of these. On the 1st of October he sensibly perceived the
trifling dose of fifty drops; on the first of November he was
taking, without increased sensation, an ounce vial of
&quot;M'Munn&quot; daily.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From that time--totally ignorant of the
terrible trap which lay grinning under the bait he dabbled
with--he continued to take opium at short intervals for several
years. When by the physician's orders he abandoned
&quot;M'Munn,&quot; on the subsidence of the eye-difficulty, his
symptoms were uneasy rather than distressing, and disappeared
after a few days' oppression at the pit of the stomach and a few
nights' troubled dreaming. But he had not forgotten the sweet
dissolving views at midnight, the great executive achievements at
noonday, the heavenly sense of a self-reliance which dare go
anywhere, say anything, attempt anything in the world. He had not
forgotten the nonchalance under slight, the serenity in pain, the
apathy to sorrow, which for one month set him calm as Boodh in
the temple-splendors of his darkened room. He had not forgotten
that the only perfect peace he had ever experienced was there,
and he remembered that peace as something which seemed to blend
all the assuaged passion and confirmed dignity of old age with
that energy of high emprise which thrills the nerves of manhood.
He had tasted as many sources of earthly pleasure as any man I
ever knew; but the ecstasies of form and color, wine, Eros,
music, perfume, all the luxuries of surrounding which wealth
could purchase or high-breeding appreciate, were as nothing to
him in comparison with the memory of that time on which his
family threw away their sympathy when they called it his
&quot;month of suffering.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Accordingly, without much more instinct of
concealment than if it were an occasional tendency to some slight
convivial excess, he had resort to M'Munn, in ounce doses,
whenever the world went wrong with him. If he had a headache or a
toothache; if the weather depressed him; if he had a certain
&quot;stint&quot; of work to do without the sense of native vigor
to accomplish it; if he was perplexed and wished to clear his
head of passion; if anxieties kept him awake; if irregularities
disturbed his digestion--he had always one refuge certain. No
fateful contingency could pursue him inside M'Munn's enchanted
circle. He was a young and wealthy bachelor, living the life of a
refined bon vivant; an insatiable traveler, surrounded by
flatterers, and without a single friend who loved him enough to
warn him of his danger excepting those who, like himself, were
too ignorant to know it. After three years of dalliance he became
an habitual user of opium, and had been one for eight years when
I was first called to him.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By the time that the daily habit fastened
itself he had learned of other opiate preparations than M'Munn's,
and finding a certain insufficiency characterize that tincture as
he increased the size of the dose, had recourse to laudanum,
which contains the full native vigor of the drug unmodified. This
nauseated him. He had the same experience with gum opium, opium
pills, and opium powder; so that he was driven to that form of
exhibition which sooner or later naturally strikes almost every
opium-eater as the most portable, energetic, and
instantaneous--morphia or one of its salts. My friend usually
kept the simple alkaloid in a paper, and dissolved it as he
needed it in clear water, sometimes substituting an equivalent of
&quot;Magendie's Solution,&quot; which contains sixteen grams of
the salt diffused through an ounce of water by the addition of a
few drops of sulfuric acid. When I first saw him he had reached a
daily dose of twelve grains of sulphate of morphia, and on
occasions of high excitement had increased his dose without
exaggerating the sensible effect to nearly twenty. The twelve
which formed his habitual per diem were divided into two equal
doses, one taken immediately after rising, the other just before
sundown.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As yet he had not begun to feel the worst
physical effects which sooner or later visit the opium-eater. His
digestion seemed unimpaired so long as he took his morphia
regularly; he was sallow and somewhat haggard, but thus far no
distressing biliary symptoms had manifested themselves; his sleep
was always dreamy, and he woke at short intervals during the
night, but invariably slept again at once, and had so adjusted
himself to the habit as to show no signs of suffering from
wakefulness; his hand was steady; his muscular system easily
exhausted, but by no means what one would call feeble. As he
himself told me, he had come to the conclusion to emancipate
himself because opium-eating was a horrible mental bondage. The
physical power of the drug over him he only realized when
attempting its abandonment. Its spiritual thralldom was his
hourly misery. He was connected by blood and marriage with
several of the best families in the land. Money had not been
stinted in his education, and his capabilities were as great as
his advantages. He was one of the bravest, fairest, most generous
natures I ever came in contact with; was versatile as a Yankee
Crichton; had ridden his own horse in a trotting match and beaten
Bill Woodruff; had carried his own little 30-ton schooner from
the Chesapeake to the Golden Gate through the Straits of
Magellan; had swum with the Navigators' Islanders, shot buffalo,
hunted chamois, and lunched on mangosteens at Penang. Through all
his wanderings the loftiest sense of what was heroic in human
nature and divine in its purified form, the monitions of a most
tender conscience, and the echoes of that Puritan education which
above all other schemes of training makes human responsibility
terrible, had gone with him like his tissue. He saw the good and
great things within reach of a fulfilled manhood, and of a sudden
waked up to feel that they could on earth never be his. He was
naturally very truthful, and, although the invariable tendency of
opium-eating is to extirpate this quality, could not flatter
himself. Other minds around him responded to a sudden call as his
own did not. Every day the need of energy took him more by
surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The image-graving and project-building
characteristic of opium, which comes on with a sense of genial
radiation from the epigastrium about a quarter of an hour after
the dose, had not yet so entirely disappeared from its effect on
him, as it always does at a later stage of the indulgence. But
instead of being an instigation to the delightful reveries which
ensued on his earlier doses, this peculiarity was now an
executioner's knot in the hands of Remorse. He was daily and
nightly haunted by plans and pictures whose feverish unreal
beauty he remembered having seen through a hundred times. Those
Fata Morgana plans, should he again waste on them the effort of
construction? The result had been a chaos of aimless, ineffectual
days. Those pictures, why were they brought again to mock him?
Were they not horrible impossibilities? Were they not, through
the paralysis of his executive faculties, mere startling
likenesses of Disappointment? In his opium dreams he had seen his
own ships on the sea; commerce bustling in his warehouse; money
overflowing in this bank; babies crowing on his knee; a wife
nestling at his breast; a basso voice of tremendous natural power
and depth scientifically cultivated to its utmost power of
pleasing artists or friends; a country estate on the Hudson, or
at Newport, with emerald lawns sloping down to the amber river on
the leek-green sea; the political and social influence of a great
landholder. How pleasurably he had once perceived all these
possible joys and powers! How undeludedly he now saw their
impossible execution!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">So, coming to me, he told me that his object in
trying to leave off opium was to escape from these horrible
ghosts of a life's unfulfilled promise. Only when he tried to
abandon opium did he realize the physical hold the drug had on
him. Its spiritual thralldom was his hourly misery.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For three months I tried to treat him in his
own house, here in the city. A practitioner of any experience
need not be told with what success. I could reduce him to a dose
of half a grain of sulphate of morphia a day, keep him there one
week, and making a morning call at the expiration of that time
discover that some nocturnal nervous paroxysm had necessitated
either a return to five grains or a use of brandy (which, though
no drinker, he tried to substitute) sufficient to demand a much
larger dose of opium in its reaction. He had lost most of his
near connections, and not for one hour could any hired attendant
have withstood his appeal, or that marvelous ingenuity by which,
without appeal, the opium-eater obtains the drug which, to him,
is like oxygen to the normal man.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This ingenuity manifests itself in subterfuges
of a complicated construction and artistic plausibility which
might have puzzled Richelieu; but it is really nothing to wonder
at when we recollect the law of nature by which any extreme
agony, so long as it continues remediable, sharpens and
concentrates all a man's faculties upon the one single object of
procuring the remedy. If my house is on fire, I run to the
hydrant by a mere automatic operation of my nerves. If my leg is
caught in the bite of a paying-out hawser, my whole brain focuses
at once on that single thought, &quot;an axe.' If I am enduring
the agony which opium alone can cause and cure, every faculty of
my mind is called to the aid of the tortured body which wants it.
When a man has used opium for a long time the condition of his
brain supervening on his deprivation of the drug for a period of
twenty-four hours is such as very frequently to render him
suicidal. Cottle tells us how Coleridge one day took a walk along
Bristol wharves, and sent his attendant down the pier to inquire
the name of a vessel, while he slipped into a druggist's on the
quay and bought a quart of laudanum; but in no fibre of his
nature could Cottle conceive the awful sense of a force
despotizing it over his will, a degradation descending on his
manhood, which Coleridge felt as he concentrated on that one
single cry of his animal nature and the laudanum which it spoke
for, fall the faculties of construction and insight which had
created the &quot;Ancient Mariner&quot; and the &quot;Aids to
Reflection.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Likewise I suppose there are very few people
who could patiently regard the fact that one of the very purest
and bravest souls I ever knew had become so demoralized by the
perseverance of disease and suffering as to deal like a lawyer
with his best friends, and shuffle to the very edge of falsehood,
when his nature clamored for opium. I was particular to tell him
whenever I detected any evasion (an occasion on which his shame
and remorse were terrible to witness) that I, personally, had
nonetheless respect for him. I knew he was dominated, and in no
sense more responsible for breaking his resolution than he would
have been had he vowed to hold his finger in the gas-blaze until
it burned off. In this latter case the mere translation of
chemical decomposition into pain, and round the automatic
nerve-arc into involuntary motion, would have drawn his finger
out of the blaze, as it did in the cases of Mutius Sevola and
Cranmer, if they ever attempted the feat credited them by
tradition. In his case the abandonment of opium brought on an
agony which took his actions entirely out of voluntary control,
eclipsing the higher ideals and heroisms of his imagination at
once, and reducing him to that automatic condition in which the
nervous system issues and enforces only those edicts which are
counseled by pure animal self- preservation. Whatever may have
been the patient's responsibility in beginning the use of
narcotics or stimulants (and I usually find, the case of
opium-eaters, that its degree has been very small indeed,
therapeutic use often fixing the habit forever before a patient
has convalesced far enough even to know what he is taking)
habituation invariably tends to reduce the man to the automatic
plane, in which the will returns wholly to the tutelage of
sensation and emotion, as it was in infancy; while all the
Intellectual, save Memory, and the most noble and imperishable
among the Moral faculties may survive this disorganization for
years, standing erect above the remainder of a personality
defrauded of its completion to show what a great and beautiful
house might have been built on such strong an shapely pillars.
Inebriates have been repeatedly known to risk imminent death if
they could not reach their liquor in any other way. The grasp
with which liquor holds a man when it turns on him, even after he
has abused it for a lifetime, compared with the ascendancy
possessed by opium over the unfortunate habituated to it for but
a single year, is as the clutch of an angry woman to the embrace
of Victor Hugo's Pieuvre. A patient whom, after habitual use of
opium for ten years, I met when he had spent eight years more in
reducing his daily dose to half a grain of morphia, with a view
to its eventual complete abandonment, once spoke to me in these
words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;God seems to help a man in getting out of
every difficulty but opium. There you have to claw your way out
over red-hot coals on your hands and knees, and drag yourself by
main strength through the burning dungeon- bars.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This statement does not exaggerate the feeling
of many another opium- eater whom I have known.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now, such a man is a proper subject, not for
reproof, but for medical treatment. The problem of his case need
embarrass nobody. It is as purely physical as one of small-pox.
When this truth is as widely understood among the laity as it is
known by physicians, some progress may be made in staying the
frightful ravages of opium among the present generation. Now,
indeed, it is a difficult thing to prevent relatives from
exacerbating the disorder and the pain of a patient, who, from
their uninformed standpoint, seems as sane and responsible as
themselves, by reproaches at which they would shudder, as at any
other cruelty, could they be brought to realize that their friend
is suffering under a disease of the very machinery of volition;
and no more to be judge harshly for his acts than a wound for
suppurating or the bowels for continuing the peristaltic motion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finding--as is common with all physicians I
have found so many times before--that no control of the case
could be obtained while the patient stayed at home, and deeply
renewing my often-experienced regret that the science and
Christian charity of this country have perfected no scheme by
which either inebriates or opium-eaters may be properly treated
in a special institution of their own, I was at length
reluctantly compelled to send my friend to an ordinary water-cure
at some distance from town.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The cause of my reluctance was not the prospect
of a too liberal use of water, for by arrangement with the heads
of the establishment I was able to control that as I chose;
moreover, an employment of the hot-bath in what would ordinarily
be excess is absolutely necessary as a sedative throughout the
first week of the struggle. I have had several patients whom
during this period I plunged into water at 110 degrees Fahrenheit
as often as fifteen times in a single day--each bath lasting as
long as the patient experienced relief. In some cases this
Elysium coming after the rack has been the only period for a
month in which the sufferer had anything resembling a doze. My
reluctance arose from the necessity of sending a patient in such
an advanced state of the opium disease so far away from me that I
must rely on reports written by people without my eyes, for
keeping personally au courant with the case; that I must consult
and prescribe by letter, subject to the execution of my plans by
men, who, though excellent and careful, were ignorant of my
theories of treatment, and had never made this particular disease
a specialty. I accordingly sent Mr. A. away to the water-cure,
all friendless and alone to fight the final battle of his life
against tougher odds than he had ever before encountered. At no
time in my life have I realized with greater bitterness the
helplessness of a practitioner who has no institution of his own
to take such cases to than when I shook his poor, dry sallow hand
and bade him goodbye at the station.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">As I said in the beginning, I am just home from
seeing the result. Mr. A. has fared as special cases always do
where there is no special provision for them. To speak plainly,
he had been badly neglected; and that, undoubtedly, without the
slightest intention on the part of the heads of the house to do
other than their duty. Six weeks ago I heard from the first
physician that any friend was entirely free from opium, and,
though still suffering, was steadily on the mend. I had no
further news from him till I was called to his bedside by a note
which said he feared he was dying, penciled in a hand as
tremulously illegible as the confession of Guy Fawkes. I was with
him by the earliest train I could take, after arranging with a
neighbor for my practice, and found him in a condition which led
him to say, as I myself said at the commencement of this article:
&quot;Would to God that every young person could stand for a
single hour by this bedside before Life's responsibilities have
become the sentinels and Habit the jailer of the Will!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had not been intelligently informed
respecting the progress of his case. He had been better at no
time when I was told he was so, though his freedom from opium had
been of even longer duration than I was advised. For ninety days
he had been without opium in any form. The scope of so
untechnical an article leaves no room to detail what had been
done for him as alleviation. His prostration had been so great
that he could not correspond with me himself until the moment of
his absolutely extremity; and only after repeated entreaties to
telegraph to myself and his family had been refused on the ground
that his condition was not critical, he managed to get off the
poor scrawl which brought me to his side.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the ninety days he had been going without
opium he had known nothing like proper sleep. I desire to be
understood with mathematical literalness. There had been periods
when he had been semi-conscious; when the outline of things in
his room grew vaguer and for five minutes he had a dull sensation
of not knowing where he was. This temporary numbness was the only
state which in all that time simulated sleep. From the hour he
first refused his craving, and went to the battlefield of bed, he
had endured such agony as I believe no man but the opium-eater
has ever known. I am led to believe that the records of fatal
lesion, mechanical childbirth, cancerous affection, the stake
itself, contains no greater torture than a confirmed opium-eater
experiences in getting free. Popularly this suffering is supposed
to be purely intellectual-- but nothing can be wider of the
truth. Its intellectual part is bad enough, but the physical
symptoms are appalling beyond representation. The look on the
face of the opium sufferer is indeed one of such keen mental
anguish that outsiders may well be excused for supposing that is
all. I shall never forget till my dying day that awful Chinese
face which actually made me rein my horse at the door of the
opium hong where it appeared, after a night's debauch, at six
o'clock one morning when I was riding in the outskirts of a
Pacific city. It spoke of such a nameless horror in its owner's
soul that I made the sign for a pipe and proposed, in
&quot;pigeon English,&quot; to furnish the necessary coin. The
Chinaman sank down on the steps of the hong, like a man hearing
medicine proposed to him when he was gangrened from head to foot,
and made a gesture, palms downward, toward the ground, as one who
said, &quot;It has done its last for me--I am paying the matured
bills of penalty.&quot; The man had exhausted all that opium
could give him; and now, flattery past, the strong one kept his
goods in peace. When the most powerful alleviative known to
medical science has bestowed the last Judas kiss which is
necessary to emasculate its victim, and, sure of the prey,
substitutes stabbing for blandishment, what alleviative, stronger
than the strongest, shall soothe such doom? I may give
chloroform. I always do in the denouement of bad
cases--ether--nitrous oxide. In employing the first two agents I
secure rest, but I induce death nine cases out of ten. Nothing is
better known to medical men than the intolerance of the system to
chloroform or ether after opium. Nitrous oxide I am still
experimenting with, but its simple undiffused form is too
powerful an agent to use with a patient who for many days must be
hourly treated for persevering pain. So the opium-eater is left
as entirely without anesthetic as the usual practice leaves him
without therapeutic means. Both here and abroad opium-eaters have
discovered the fact that, in an inveterate case, where opium
fails to act on the brain through the exhausted tissues of the
stomach, bichloride of mercury in combination with the dose
behaves like a mordant in the presence of a dye, and, so to
speak, precipitates opium upon the calloused surfaces of the
mucous and nervous layers. This expedient soon exhausts itself in
a death from colliquative diarrhea, produced partly by the final
decompositions of tissue which the poisonously antiseptic
property of opium has all along improperly stored away; partly by
the definite corrosions of the new addition to the dose. But in
no case is there any relief to a desperate case of opium-eating
save death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Remembering that Chinaman's faced I can not
wonder at the popular notion regarding the abandonment of opium.
Men say it is a mental pain; because spiritual woe is the
expression of the sufferer's countenance. And so it is, but this
woe is underlain by the keenest brute suffering. Let me sketch
the opium-eater's experience on the rugged road upward.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let us suppose him a resolute man, who means to
be free, and with that intent has reduced to a hundred drops the
daily dose which for several years had amounted to an ounce of
laudanum. I am not supposing an extreme case. An ounce of
laudanum is a small per diem for any man who has taken his
regular rations of the drug for a twelvemonth. In the majority of
cases I have found an old habitue's daily portion to exceed
three, or the equivalent of that dose in crude opium or morphia;
making seventy-two grains of the gum or twelve of its most
essential alkaloid. In one most interesting case I found a man
who having begun on the first of January with one half a grain of
sulphate of morphia for disease, at the end of March was, to all
appearance, as hopeless an opium-eater as ever lived, taking
thirty-two grains of the salt per day in the form of Magendie's
Solution. This, however, was an unusual case. According to my
experience the average opium-eater reaches twelve grains of
morphia [microfiche illegible]... and may live after that to
treble the amount: the worst case I ever knew attaining a dose of
ninety grains, or one and a half of the drachm vials ordinarily
sold. I am happy, in passing, to add that for more than two years
both the extreme cases just mentioned have been entirely cured.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the opium-eater has been in the habit of
dividing his daily dose he begins to feel some uneasiness within
an hour after his first deprivation, but it amounts to nothing
more than an indefinite restlessness. In any case his first
well-marked opium torments occur early after he has been without
the drug for twenty-four hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the expiration of that time he begins to
feel a peculiar corded and tympanic tightness about the
epigastrium. A feverish condition of the brain, which sometimes
amounts to absolute phantasia, now ensues, marked off into
periods of increasing excitement by a heavy sleep, which, after
each interval, grows fuller of tremendous dreams, and breaks up
with a more intensely irritable waking. I have held a man's hand
while he lay dreaming about the thirty-sixth hour of his
struggle. His eyes were closed for less than a minute by the
watch, but he awoke in a horrible agony of fear from what seemed
to have been a year-long siege of some colossal and demoniac
Vicksburg.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">After the opium-eater has been for forty-eight
hours without his solace this heavy sleep entirely disappears.
While it stays it never lasts over half an hour at a time, and is
so broken by the crash of stupendous visions as not to amount to
proper slumber. During its period of continuance the opium-eater
woos its approaches with an agony which shows his instinct of the
coming weeks of sleeplessness. It never rests him in any valid
sense. It is a congestive decomposition rather than any normal
reconstruction of the brain. He wakes out of it each time with a
heart more palpitating; in a perspiration more profuse; with a
greater uncertainty of sense and will; with a more confused
memory; in an intenser agony of body and horror of hopelessness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Every nerve in the entire frame now suddenly
awakes with such a spasm of revivification that no parallel agony
to that of the opium-eater at this stage can be adduced, unless
it be that of the drowned person resuscitated by artificial
means. Nor does this parallel fully represent the suffering, for
the man resuscitated from drowning re-oxidizes all his surplus
carbon in a few minutes of intense torture, while the anguish
which burns away that carbon and other matter, properly effete,
stored away in the tissues by opium, must last for hours, days,
and weeks. Who is sufficient for this long, long pull?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">From the hour this pain begins to manifest
itself it continues (in any average case of a year's previous
habituation to the drug) for at least a week without one second's
lull or exhaustion. A man may catch himself dozing between spasms
of tic-douloureux or toothache; he never doubts whether he is
awake one instant in the first week after dropping his opium. One
patient whom I found years ago at a watercure followed the
watchman all night on crutches through his tour of inspection
around the establishment. Other people, after walking a long
time, shift from chair to chair in their rooms, talking to
anybody who may happen to be present in a low-voiced, suicidal
manner, which inexperience finds absolutely blood-freezing. Later
such rock to and fro, moaning with agony, for hours at a time,
but saying nothing. Still others go to their beds at once, and
lie writhing there until the struggle is entirely decided. I have
learned that this last class is generally the most hopeful.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The period during which this pain is to
continue depends upon two elements.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1st. How long has the patient habitually taken
opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2d. How much constitutional strength remains to
throw it off?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;How much has he taken in the
aggregate?&quot; is practically not an equivalent of the first
question. I have found an absolutely incurable opium-eater who
had never used more than ten grains of morphia per diem; but he
had been taking it habitually for a dozen years. In another case
the patient had for six months repeated before each meal the
ten-grain dose which served the other all day; but he was a man
whose pluck under pain equaled a woman's, and after a fortnight's
anguish of such horror that one could scarcely witness it without
being moved to tears came out into perfect freedom. The former
patient, although he had never in any one day experienced such
powerful effects from opium as the latter, had used the drug so
long that every part of his system had reconstructed itself to
meet the abnormal conditions, and must go through a second
process of reconstruction, without any anodyne to mask the pain
resulting from its decomposition, before it could again tolerate
existence of the normal kind. If opium were not an anodyne the
terrible structural changes which it works would cause no
surprise; it would be felt eating out its victim's life like so
much nitric acid. During the early part of the opium-eater's
career these structural changes go on with a rapidity which
partly accounts for the vast disengagements of nervous force, the
exhilaration, the endurance of effort, which characterize this
stage, later to be substituted by utter nervous apathy. By the
time the substitution occurs something has taken place throughout
the physical structure which may be rudely likened to the final
equilibrium of a neutral salt after the effervescence between an
acid and an alkali. So to speak, the tissues have now combined
with their full equivalent of all the poisonous alkaloids in
opium. Further use of it produces no new disengagements of
nervous force; the victim may double, quadruple his dose, but he
might as well expect further ebullition by adding more
aqua-fortis to a satisfied nitrate as to develop with opium
exhilarating currents in a tissue whose combination with that
drug have already reached their chemical limit. FN* _____ *FN I
say &quot;chemical&quot; because so much it is possible to known
experientally; and the very interesting examination of such
higher forces as constantly seem to intrude in any nervous
disturbance would here involve the discussion of a theoretical
&quot;vital principle&quot;-- something apart from and between
the soul and physical activities--which scientific men are
universally abandoning. ___</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater now only continues his habit to
preserve the terrible static condition to which it has reduced
him, and to prevent that yet more terrible dynamic condition into
which he comes with every disturbance of equilibrium; a condition
of energetic and agonizing dissolutions which must last until
every fiber of wrongly changed tissue is burned up and healthily
replaced. Though I have called the early reactions of opium
rapid, they are necessarily much less so than those produced by a
simple chemical agent. No drug approaches it in the possession of
cumulative characteristics; its dependence on the time element
must therefore be always carefully considered in treating a case.
This fact leads us to understand the other element in the
question, how long the torments of the opium-fighter must
continue. Having ascertained the chronology of his case, we must
say, &quot;Given this period of subjection, has the patient
enough constitutional vigor left to endure the period of
reconstruction which must correspond to it?&quot; ** FN -------
** (FN) Not correspond day by day. At that rate a reforming
opium-eater (I use the particle in the physical sense, for very
few opium-eaters are more to blame than any other sick persons)
must pay a &quot;shent per shent&quot; which no constitution
could survive. The correspondence is simply proportional. -------</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am naturally sanguine, and began my study of
opium-eaters with the belief that none of them were hopeless.
Experience has taught me that there is a point beyond which any
constitution--especially one so abnormally sensitive as the
opium-eater's--can not endure keen physical suffering without
death from spinal exhaustion. I once heard the eminent Dr.
Stevens say that he made it a rule never to attempt a surgical
operation if it must consume more than an hour. Similarly, I have
come to the conclusion never to amputate a man from his
opium-self if the agony must last longer than three months.
Uneasiness--corresponding to the irritations of dressing a
stump--may continue a year longer; and few victims of the habit
outlive a certain opium-prurience, which has also its analogue in
the occasional titillation of a healed wound--these are
comparatively tolerable; but, if we expect to save a patient's
life, we must not protract an agony which so absolutely
interferes with normal sleep as that of the opium-eater's for
longer than three months in the case of any constitution I have
thus far encountered.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Usually as early as the third day after its
abandonment (unless the constitution has become so impaired by
long habituation that there will probably be no vital reaction)
opium begins to show its dissolutions from the tissue by a
profuse and increasingly acrid bilious diarrhea, which must not
be checked if diagnosis has revealed sufficient constitutional
vigor to justify any attempt at abandonment of the drug.
Hemorrhoids may result; they must be topically treated; mild
astringents may be used when the tendency seems getting out of
eventual control; bland foods must be given as often as the
usually fastidious appetite will tolerate them; the only tonic
must be beef-tea--diffusible stimulus invariably increasing the
agony, whether in the form of ale, wine, or spirits. Short of
threatened collapse, the bowels must not be retarded. There is
nothing in the faintest degree resembling a substitute for opium,
but from time to time various alleviates, which can not be
discussed in an untechnical article, may be administered with
benefit. The spontaneous termination of the diarrhea will
indicate that the effete matters we must remove have been mainly
eliminated, and that we may shortly look for a marked mitigation
of the pain, followed by conditions of great debility but
increasingly favorable to the process of reconstruction. That
process, yet more than the alleviate, demands a book rather than
an article.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have intentionally deferred any description
of the agony of the opium struggle as a sensation, until I
returned from depicting general symptoms, to relate the
particular case which is my text. The sufferings of the patient,
from whom I have just returned, are so comprehensive as almost to
be exhaustively typical.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When simple nervous excitement had for two days
alternated with the already mentioned intervals of delirious
slumber, a dull, aching sensation began manifesting itself
between his shoulders and in the region of the loins. Appetite
for food had been failing since the first denial of that for
opium. The most intense gastric irritability now appeared in the
form of an aggravation of the typantic tightness, corrosive acid
ructations, heartburn, water-brash, and a peculiar sensation, as
painful as it is indescribable, of self-consciousness in the
whole upper part of the digestive canal. The best idea of this
last symptom may be found by supposing all the nerves of
involuntary motion which supply that tract with vitality,
suddenly to be gifted with the exquisite sensitiveness to their
own processes which is produced by its correlative object in some
organ of special sense--the whole organism assimilating itself to
a retina or a finger-tip. Sleep now disappeared. This initiated
an entire month during which the patient had not one moment of
even partial unconsciousness.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In less than a week from the beginning the
symptoms indicated a most obstinate chronic gastritis. There was
a perpetual sense of corrosion at the pit of the stomach very
like that which characterizes the fatal operation of arsenic.
There was less action of the liver than usually indicates a
salvable case, and no irritation of the lowest intestines. Pari
passu with the gastritic suffering, the neuralgic pain spread
down the extremities from an apparent center between the kidneys,
through the trunk, from another line near the left margin of the
liver, and through the whole medullary substance of the brain
itself. Although I was so unfortunate as not to be beside him
during this stage, I can still infallibly draw on my whole
experience for information regarding the intensity of this pain.
Tic-douloureux most nearly resembles it in character. Like that
agonizing affection, it has periods of exacerbation; unlike it,
it has no intervals of continuous repose. Like tic-douloureux,
its sensation is a curiously fluctuating one, as if pain had been
fluidized and poured in trickling streams through the tubules of
nerve tissue which are affected by it; but, unlike that, it
affects every tubule in the human body--not a single diseased
locality. Charles Reade chaffs the doctors very wittily in
&quot;Hard Cash&quot; on their penchant for the word
&quot;hyperaesthesia,&quot; but nothing else exactly defines that
exaggeration of nervous sensibility which I have invariably seen
in opium-eaters. Some of them were hurt by an abrupt slight
touch, and cried out at the jar of a heavy footstep like a
patient with acute rheumatism. Some developed sensitiveness with
the progress of expurgating the poison, until their very hair and
nails felt sore, and the whole surface of the skin suffered from
cold air or water like the lips of a wound. After all, utterly
unable to convey an idea of the kind of suffering, I must content
myself by repeating, of its extent, that no prolonged pain of any
kind known to science can equal it. The totality of the
experience is only conceivable by adding this physical torture to
a mental anguish which even the Oriental pencil of De Quincey has
but feebly painted; an anguish which slays the will, yet leaves
the soul conscious of its murder; which utterly blots out hope,
and either paralyzes the reasoning faculties which might suggest
encouragements, or deadens the emotional nature to them as
thoroughly as if they were not perceived; an anguish which
sometimes includes just, but always a vast amount of unjust
self-reproach which brings every failure and inconsistency, every
misfortune or sin of a man's life as clearly before his face as
on the day he was first mortified or degraded by it--before his
face, not in one terrible dream, which is once for all over with
sunrise, but as haunting ghosts, made out by the feverish eyes of
the soul down to the minutest detail of ghastliness, and never
leaving the side of the rack on which he lies for a moment of
dark or daylight, till sleep, at the end of a month, first drops
out of heaven on his agony.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A third element in the suffering must briefly
be mentioned. It results directly from the others. It is that
exhaustion of nervous power which invariably ensues on protracted
pain of mind or body. it proceeds beyond reaction to collapse in
a hopeless case; it stops this side of that in a salvable one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On reaching his room I found my friend
bolstered upright in bed, with a small two-legged crutch at hand
to prop his head on when he became weary of the perpendicular
position. This had been his attitude for fifty days. Whether from
its impeding his circulation, the distribution of his nervous
currents, or both, the prostrate posture invariably brought on
cessation of the heart and the sense of intolerable strangling.
His note told me he was dying of heart disease, but, as I
expected, I found that malady merely simulated by nervous
symptoms, and the trouble purely functional. His food was
arrowroot or sago, and beef-tea. Of the vegetable preparation he
took perhaps half a dozen tablespoonfuls a day; of the animal
variable quantities, averaging half a pint per diem. This, though
small, was far from the minimum of nutriment upon which life has
been supported through the most critical periods. Indeed, I have
known three patients tided over stages of disease otherwise
desperately typhoid by beef-tea baths, in which the proportion of
ozmazone was just perceptible, and the sole absorbing agency was
a faint activity left in the pores of the skin. But these
patients had suffered no absolute disorganization. The
practitioner had to encounter a swift specific poison, not to
make over tissues abnormally misconstructed by its long insidious
action. On examination I discovered facts which I had often
feared, but never before absolutely recognized, in my friend's
case. The stomach itself, in its most irreproducible tissue, had
undergone a partial but permanent disorganization. The substance
of the organ itself had been altered in a way for which science
knows no remedy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hereafter, then, it can only be rechanged by
that ultimate decomposition which men call death. Over the
opium-eater's coffin at least, thank God! a wife and sister can
stop weeping and say, &quot;He's free.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I called to my friend's bedside a consultation
of three physicians and the most nearly related survivor of his
family. I laid the case before them; assisted them to a full
prognosis; and invited their views. I spent two nights with my
friend. I have said that during the first month of trial he had
not a moment of even partial unconsciousness. Since that time
there had been perhaps ten occasions a day, when for a period
from one minute in length to five, his poor, pain-wrinkled
forehead sank on his crutch, his eyes fell shut, and to outsiders
he seemed asleep. But that which appeared sleep was internally to
him only one stupendous succession of horrors which confusedly
succeeded each other for apparent eternities of being, and ended
with some nameless catastrophe of woe or wickedness, in a waking
more fearful than the stage volcanically ruptured by it. During
the nights I sat by him these occasional relaxations, as I
learned, reached their maximum length, my familiar presence
acting as a sedative, but from each of them he woke bathed in
perspiration from sole to crown; shivering under alternate
flushes of chill and fever; mentally confused to a degree which
for half an hour rendered every object in the room unnatural and
terrible to him; with a nervous jerk, which threw him quite out
of bed, although in his waking state two men were requisite to
move him; and with a cry of agony as loud as any under
amputation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The result of our consultation was a unanimous
agreement not to press the case further. Physicians have no
business to consider the speculative question, whether death
without opium is preferable to life with it. They are called to
keep people on the earth. We were convinced that to deprive the
patient longer of opium would be to kill him. This we had no
right to do without his consent. He did not consent, and I gave
him five grains of morphia** FN ----- ** (FN) To the younger men
of the profession rather than to the public generally I need here
to say that this dose is not as excessive as it would naturally
appear to be in the case of a man who had used no form of opium
for ninety days. When you have to resume the drug go cautiously.
But you will generally find the amount of it required to produce
the sedative effects in any case which returns to opium, after
abandonment of a long habituation, startlingly large, and slow in
its effects. ----- between 8 and 12 o'clock on the morning of the
day I had to return here. He was obliged to eat a few mouthfuls
of sago before the alkaloid could act upon his nervous system. I
need only point out the significance of this indication. The
shallower lying nervous fibers of the stomach had become
definitely paralyzed, and such digestion as could be perfected
under these circumstances was the only method of getting the
stimulant in contact with any excitable nerve-substance. In other
words, mere absorbent and assimilative tissue was all of him
which for the purpose of receiving opium partially survived
disorganization of the superficial nerves. Of that surviving
tissue, one mucous patch was irredeemably gone. (This particular
fact was the one which cessation from opium more distinctly
unmasked.) At noon he had become tolerably comfortable; before I
left (7 p.m.) he had enjoyed a single half hour of something like
normal slumber.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He will have to take opium all his life.
Further struggle is suicide. Death will probably occur at any
rate not from an attack of what we usually consider disease, but
from the disintegrating effects on tissue of the habit itself.
So, whatever he may do, his organs march to death. He will have
to continue the habit which kills him only because abandoning it
kills him sooner; for self-murder has dropped out of the purview
of the moral faculties and become a mere animal question of time.
The only way left him to preserve his intellectual faculties
intact is to keep his future daily dose at the tolerable minimum.
Henceforth all his dreams of entire liberty must be relegated to
the world to come. He may be valuable as a monitor, but in the
executive uses of this mighty modern world henceforth he can
never share. Could the immortal soul find itself in a more
inextricable, a more grisly complication?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In publishing his case I am not violating that
Hippocratic vow which protects the relations of patient and
adviser; for, as I dropped my friend's wasted hand and stepped to
the threshold, he repeated a request he had often made to me,
saying:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;It is almost like Dives asking for a
messenger to his brethren; but tell them, tell all young men,
what it is, 'that they come not into this torment.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Already perhaps--by the mere statement of the
case--I might be considered to have fulfilled my promise. But
since monition often consists as much in enlightenment as
intimidation, let me be pardoned for briefly presenting a few
considerations regarding the action of opium upon the human
system while living, and the peculiar methods by which the drug
encompasses its death.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">What is Opium?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is the most complicated drug in the
Pharmacopeia. though apparently a simple gummy paste, it
possesses a constitution which analysis reveals to contain no
less than 25 elements, each one of them a compound by itself, and
many of them among the most complex compounds known to modern
chemistry. Let me concisely mention these by classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, at least three earthy salts--the
sulphates of lime, alumia, and potassa. Second, two organic and
one simpler acid--acetic (absolutely vinegar), meconic (one of
the most powerful irritants which can be applied to the
intestines through the bile), and sulfuric. All three exist
uncombined in the gum, and free to work their will on the mucous
tissues. A green extractive matter, which comes in all vegetal
bodies developed under sunlight, next deserves a place by itself,
because it is one of the few organic bodies of which no rational
analysis has ever been pretended. Though we cannot state the
constitution of this chlorophyll, we know that, except by turning
acid in the stomach, it remains inert on the human system, as one
might imagine would happen if he swallowed a bunch of green
grass. Lignin, with which it is always associated, is mere woody
fiber, and has no direct physical action. In no instance has any
stomach been found to digest it save an insect's-- some
naturalists thinking that certain beetles make their horny wing-
cases of that. I believe one man did think he had discovered a
solvent for it in the gastric juice of the beaver, but that view
is not widely entertained. So far as it exists in opium it can
only act as a foreign substance and a mechanical irritant to the
human bowels. Next come two inert, indigestible, and very similar
gummy bodies, mucilagin and bassorin. Sugar, are powerfully
active volatile principle, and a fixed oil (probably allied to
turpentine) are the only other invariable constituents of opium
belonging to the great organic group of the hydro- carbons.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I now come to a group by far the most important
of all. Almost without exception the vegetable poisons belong to
what are called the &quot;nitrogenous alkaloids.&quot; Strychnia,
brucia, ignatia, calabarin, woovarin, atropine, digitalin, and
many others, including all whose effect is most tremendous upon
the human system, are in this group. Not without insight did the
early discoverers call nitrogen azote, &quot;the foe to
life.&quot; It so habitually exists in the things our body finds
most deadly that the tests for it are always the first which
occur to a chemist in the presence of any new organic poison. The
nitrogenous alkaloids owe the first part of their name to the
fact of containing this element; the second part to that of their
usually making neutral salts with acids, like an alkaline base.
The general reader may sometimes have asked himself why these
alkaloids are diversely written-- as, e.g., sometimes
&quot;morphia,&quot; and sometimes &quot;morphine.&quot; The
chemists who regard them as alkalies write them in the one way,
those who consider them neutrals, in the other. Of these
nitrogenous alkaloids, even the nuts of the tree, which furnishes
the most powerful, swift poison of the world, contains but
three--the above-named strychnia, brucia, and ignatia--principles
shared in common with its pathological congener, the St. Ignatius
bean. Opium may be found to contain twelve of them; but as one of
these (cotarnine) may be a product of distillation, and the other
(pseudo-morphia) seems only an occasional constituent, I treat
them as ten in number--rationally to be arranged under three
heads.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First, those whose action is merely acrid--so
far as known expending themselves upon the mucous coasts.
(Pseudo-morphia when it occurs belongs to these.) So do
porphyroxin; narceine; probably papaverine also; while meconin,
whose acrid properties in contact with animal tissue are similar
to that of meconic acid, forms the last of the group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second head comprises but a single
alkaloid, variously called paramorphia or thebaine. (It may
interest amateur chemists to know that its difference from
strychnia consists only in having two less equivalents of
hydrogen and six of carbon--especially when they know how closely
its physical effects follow its atomic constitution.) A dose of
one grain has produced tetanic spasms. Its chief action appears
to be upon the spinal nerves, and there is reason to suppose it a
poison of the same kind as nux vomica without the concentration
of that agent. How singular it seems to find a poison of this
totally distinct class--bad enough to set up the reputation of
any one drug by itself--in company with the remaining principles
whose effect we usually associate with opium and see clearest in
the ruin of its victim!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remainder, five in number, are the opium
alkaloids, which act generally upon the whole system, but
particularly, in their immediate phenomena, upon the brain. I
mention them in the ascending order of their nervine power:
narcotine; codeine; opianin; metamorphia, and morphia.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first of these the poppy shares in common
with many other narcotic plants--tobacco the most conspicuous
among the number. In its anti- periodic effects on the human
system it has been found similar to quinia, and it is an
undoubted narcotic poison acting on the nerves of organic life,
though, compared with its associates in the drug, comparatively
innocent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The remaining four act very much like morphia,
differing only in the size of the dose in which they prove
efficient. Most perfectly fresh constitutions feel a grain of
morphia powerfully; metamorphia is soporific in half-gain doses
(American Journal of Pharmacy, September, 1861); opianin in its
physical effects closely approximates morphia; codeia is about
one-fifth as powerful; a new subject may not get sleep short of
six grains; its main action is expended on the sympathetic
system. It does not seem to congest the brain as morphia does;
but its action on the biliary system is probably little less
deadly than that of the more powerful narcotic.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Looking at the marvelous complexity of opium we
might be led to the a priori supposition that its versatility of
action on the human system must be equally marvelous.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Miserably for the opium-eater, fortunately for
the young person who may be dissuaded from following in his
footsteps, we are left in no doubt of this matter by the
conclusions of experience. In practical action opium affects as
large an area of nervous surface, attacks it with as much
intensity, and changes it in as many ways as its complexity would
lead us to expect. I have pointed out the existence in opium of a
convulsive poison congeneric with brucia. The other chief active
alkaloids, five in number, are those which specially possess the
cumulative property. Poisons of the strychnia and hydro-cyanic
acid classes (including this just mentioned opium alkaloid,
thebaine), are swifter agents; but this perilous opium quintette
signs to every sense a lulling song from which it may not awake
for years, but wakes a slave. Every day that a man uses opium
these cumulative alkaloids get a subtler hold on him. Even a
physician addicted to the practice has no conception how their
influence piles up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At length some terrible dawn rouses him out of
a bad sleep into a worse consciousness. Though the most
untechnical man, he must already know the disorder which has
taken place in his moral nature and his will. For a knowledge of
his physical condition he must resort to his medical man, and
what, when the case is ten years old, must a practitioner tell
the patient in any average case?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Sir, the chances are entirely against
you, and the possession of a powerfully enduring constitution, if
you have it, forms a decided offset in your favor.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He then makes a thorough examination of him by
ear, touch, conversation. If enough constitution responds to the
call, he advises an immediate entrance upon the hard road of
abnegation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the practitioner finds the case hopeless he
must tell the patient so, in something like these words:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;You have either suffered a
disorganization of irreproducible membranes, or you have
deposited so much improper material in your tissue that your life
is not consistent with the protracted pain of removing it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;One by one you have paralyzed all the
excretory functions of the body. Opium, aiming at all those
functions for their death, first attacked the kidneys, and with
your experimental doses you experienced a slight access of
dysuria. As you went on, the same action, progressively paralytic
to organic life, involved the liver. Flatulence, distress at the
epigastrium, irregularity of bowels, indicated a spasmodic
performance of the liver's work, which showed it to be under high
nervous excitement. your mouth became dry through a cessation of
the salivary discharge. Your lachrymal duct was parched, and your
eye grew to have an arid look in addition to the dullness
produced by opiate contraction of the pupil.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All this time you continued to absorb an agent
which directly acts for what by a paradox may be called fatal
conservation of the tissues. Whether through its complexity
combined nitrogen, carbon, or both, the drug has interposed
itself between your very personal substance and those oxidations
by which alone its life can be maintained. It has slowed the
fires of your whole system. It has not only interposed but in
part it has substituted itself; so that along with much effete
matter of the body stored away there always exists a certain
undecomposed quantity of the agent which sustains this morbid
conservation. **FN ----- ** (FN): I frequently use what
hydropaths call &quot;a pack&quot; to relieve opium distress, and
with great benefit. After an hour and a half of perspiration, the
patient being taken out of his swaddlings, I have found in the
water which was used to wash out his sheet enough opium to have
intoxicated a fresh subject. This patient had not used opium for
a fortnight. -----</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;When this combination became established,
you began losing your appetite because no substitution of fresh
matter was required by your body for tissue wrongly conserved.
The progressive derangement of your liver manifested itself in
increased sallowness of face and cornea; the organ was working on
an inadequate vital supply because the organic nervous system was
becoming paralyzed; the veins were not strained of that which is
the bowels' proper purgative and the blood's dire poison. You had
sealed up all but a single excretory passage--the pores of the
skin. Perhaps when you had opium first given you you were told
that its intent was the promotion of perspiration but did not
know the rationale. The only way in which opium promotes
perspiration is by shutting up all the other excretory processes
of the body, and throwing the entire labor of that function upon
the pores. (When the skin gives out the opium- eater is shut up
like an entirely choked chimney, and often dies in delirium of
blood-poisoning.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;For a while--the first six years,
perhaps--your skin sustained the work which should have been
shared by the other organs--not in natural sweat, but violent
perspiration, which showed the excess of its action. Then your
palms became gradually hornier--your whole body yellower--at the
same time that your muscular system grew tremulous through
progressively failing nervous supply.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;About this time you may have had some
temporary gastric disturbance, accompanied with indescribable
distress, loathing at food, and nausea. This indicated that the
mucous lining of the stomach had been partially removed by the
corrosions of the drug, or that nervous power had suddenly come
to a standstill, which demanded an increase of stimulation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;Since that time you have been taking your
daily dose only to preserve the status in quo. The condition both
of your nervous system and your stomach indicate that you must
always take some anodyne to avoid torture, and your only anodyne
is opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;The rest of your life must be spent in
keeping comfortable, not in being happy.:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium-eaters enjoy a strange immunity from
other disease. They are not liable to be attacked by miasma in
malarious countries; epidemics or contagions where they exist.
They almost always survive to die of their opium itself. And an
opium death is usually in one of these two manners:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The opium-eater either dies in collapse through
nervous exhaustion (with the blood poisoning and delirium
above-mentioned), sometimes after an overdose, but oftener
seeming to occur spontaneously; or in the midst of physical or
mental agony, as great and irrelievable, as men suffer in hopeful
abandonment of the drug, and with a colliquative diarrhea, by
which--in a continual, fiery, acrid discharge--the system
relieves itself during a final fortnight of the effete matters
which have been accumulating for years.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Either of these ends is terrible enough; let us
draw a curtain over their details.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Opium is a corrosion and paralysis of all the
noblest forms of life. The man who voluntarily addicts himself to
it would commit in cutting his throat a suicide only swifter and
less ignoble. The habit is gaining fearful ground among our
professional men, the operatives in our mills, our weary sewing
women, our fagged clerks, our disappointed wives, our former
liquor-drunkards, our very day-laborers, who a generation ago
took gin; all our classes, from the highest to the lowest, are
yearly increasing their consumption of the drug. The terrible
demands, especially in this country, made on modern brains by our
feverish competitive life, constitute hourly temptations to some
form of the sweet, deadly sedative. Many a professional man of my
acquaintance, who twenty years ago was content with his
tri-diurnal &quot;whiskey,&quot; ten years ago, drop by drop,
began taking stronger &quot;laudanum cocktails,&quot; until he
became what he is now--an habitual opium-eater. I have tried to
show what he will be. If this article shall deter any from an
imitation of his example, or excite an interest in the
question--&quot;What he shall do to be saved?&quot;--I am
content. </font></p>

<h1>Are The Drug Laws Constitutional? </h1>

<p> <b>A Historical Perspective</b> </p>

<p> From _Our Right To Drugs_ by Thomas Szasz, Praeger
Publishers, NY (1992): </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>*The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906* </h2>

<p> Before 1907, all drugs could be sold and bought like any
other consumer good. The manufacturer did not even have to
disclose the contents of his concoction. Hence the name patent
medicine, the adjective alluding to the fact that the composition
was a trade secret, protected by a patented name. </p>

<p> Although there is no evidence that the American consumer ever
complained about the free market in drugs, there is plenty of
evidence that his self appointed protectors complained bitterly
and loudly. The first landmark event in the federal regulation of
drugs (and foods) was the Food and Drugs Act of 1906. What did
Congress intend to achieve with this seemingly laudable
legislation? To protect people from the sale of
&quot;adulterated&quot; or &quot;misbranded&quot; foods or drugs,
that is, &quot;assur[ing] the customer of the identity of the
article purchased, not of its usefulness.&quot; </p>

<p> I say Congress's aim in enacting this legislation was
seemingly laudable because, while it is desirable that people
know what drugs they buy, forcing manufacturers by law to list
the ingredients of their products is an unnecessary infringement
on the free market -- the foot in the door of
paternalistic-statist protectionism. If Great American Drugs,
Inc., wants to market a mystery product, there is no reason why
the government should prevent it from doing so. And if I want to
buy such a pig in a poke, why should the government prevent me
from making that choice? People who want to be informed about the
drugs they buy and use would abstain from purchasing mystery
products, and market forces would then create a supply of
truthfully labeled drugs. In short, there would be no need to
prohibit the non-disclosure of the contents of medicinal (or
other) products. It is enough to prohibit false disclosure and to
punish it, as fraud, by both criminal and civil penalities. As
for nondisclosure, it would be &quot;punished&quot; by the
invisible hand of the market. The truth is that behind Congress's
ostensible aim of combating drug misbranding lay its growing
antagonism to the habit of pharmacological self-pleasuring,
manifested by the act's specifically mandating the listing on the
label of what were then the main ingredients of Americans'
favorite nostrums: alcohol, hypnotics, and sedatives. The
relevant lines of the Food and Drugs Act read as follows: </p>

<p> That for purposes of this Act an article shall also be deemed
misbranded: ... if the package fails to bear a statement on the
label of the quantity or proportion of any alcohol, morphine,
opium, cocaine, heroin, alpha or beta eucaine, chloroform,
cannabis, chloral hydrate, or acetanilide. </p>

<p> It is implicit in this sentence that, back then, Congress
took for granted the legality of a free market in drugs,
including cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and morphine. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<h2>*The Harrison Act (1914) and It's Aftermath* </h2>

<p> In 1914, Congress enacted another landmark piece of anti-drug
legislation: the Harrison Narcotic Act. Originally passed as a
record-keeping law, it quickly became a prohibition statute. In
the course of the next seven years, by a curious coincidence of
history -- if, indeed, it is a coincidence -- in Russia the
Soviet Union replaced the czarist empire, while in the United
States the free market in drugs was replaced by federal drug
prohibition possessing unchallengeable authority. Excerpts from
two key Supreme Court decisions quickly tell the story. </p>

<p> In 1915, in a test of the Harrision Act, the Court upheld it
but expressed doubts about its constitutionality: &quot;While the
Opium Registration Act of December 17, 1914, may have a moral
end, as well as revenue, in view, this court, in view of the
grave doubt as to its constitutionality except as a revenue
measure, construes it as such.&quot; </p>

<p> Yet, only six years later the Court considered objection to
federal drug prohibition a taboo. In Whipple v. Martinson the
justices declared, </p>

<p> &quot;There can be no question of the authority of the State
in the exercise of its police power to regulate the
administration, sale, prescription, and use of dangerous and
habit-forming drugs.... </p>

<p> The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the
interest of public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to
enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly
established to be successfully called in question. </p>

<p> In 1914, trading in and using drugs was a right. In 1915,
limited federal drug controls were a constitutionally
questionable tax revenue measure. By 1921, the federal government
had gained not only complete control over so-called dangerous
drugs, but also a quasi-papal immunity to legal challenge of its
authority. Thus has the rejection of one of our most basic
constitutional rights become transformed into reverence for one
of our most baneful therapeutic-religious dogmas. Once ignited,
the fire of &quot;progressive&quot; drug protectionism spread and
soon enveloped the whole contry, transforming the Harrison Act
into the legislative embodiment of the &quot;moral principle that
taking narcotics for other than medicinal purposes was harmful
and should be prevented.&quot; That threw the monkey wrench
medicinal purpose into the machinery of the trade in drugs; this
undefined and undefinable concept has haunted us ever since. In
1920, drug prohibitionists won another major victory: America
was, at last, alcohol-free -- if not de facto, then at least de
jure. Since 1924, when Congress made it illegal to manufacture,
possess, or sell heroin, America has been free from heroin as
well -- if not in practice, then at least in theory. </p>

<p> [...] </p>

<p> In retelling this tale, it is impossible to overemphasize
that, although initially the drug laws were intended to protect
people from being &quot;abused&quot; by drugs others wanted to
sell them, this aim was soon replaced by that of protecting them
from &quot;abusing&quot; drugs they wanted to buy. The government
thus succeeded in depriving us not only of our basic right to
ingest whatever we choose, but also of our right to grow,
manufacture, sell, and buy agricultural products used by man
since antiquity. <br>

<h1>EVIDENCE FOUND OF ANCIENT MARIJUANA USE </h1>

<p>Albany (NY) Times Union, 20 May 1993 </p>

<p>(attributed to Newsday) </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The first physical evidence that marijuana was used as a
medicine in the ancient Mideast was reported Wednesday by Israeli
scientists who found residue of the drug with the skeleton of a
girl who apparently died in childbirth 1,600 years ago. </p>

<p>The researchers said the marijuana probably was used by a
mid-wife trying to speed the birth, as well as ease the pain.
Until now, the researchers wrote in a letter to the journal
Nature, &quot;physical evidence of cannabis (marijuana) use in
the ancient Middle East has not yet been obtained.&quot; </p>

<p>The seven researchers -- from Hebrew University, the Israel
Antiquities Authority and the National Police Headquarters
forensic division -- said references to marijuana as a medicine
are seen as far back as 1,600 B.C. in Egyptian, Assyrian, Greek
and Roman writings. But physical evidence that the hemp weed,
cannabis sativa, was used for that purpose has been missing. </p>

<p>The researchers' examination of an undisturbed family tomb
near Jerusalem dating to the fourth century AD indicated the
girl, about 14, died because her pelvis was too small to permit
normal birth. <br>

<h1>From Mr Sin to Mr Big </h1>

<p> Auth: Desmond Manderson </p>

<p> Published: 1993 </p>

<p> Publisher: Oxford University Press Australia </p>

<p> ISBN: 0 19 553531 6 </p>

<h2>Background to the Book. </h2>

<p> (From back cover) </p>

<p> From Mr Sin to Mr Big is a compelling legal and social
history of the origins and development of drug laws in Australia.
It argues that the selective enactment of 'drug' laws has been
driven by fear, racism, powerful international pressures, and the
vested interests of the medical profession, bureaucrats and
politicians, rather than by genuine concerns about the welfare of
users. </p>

<p> Behind the emotion and contoversy that surround the use of
illegal drugs lie previously unexamined assumptions about how and
why certain substances - such as opium, herion and cannabis -
have been prohibited, while others - such as alcolhol and tobacco
- have not. This book challenges these assumptions, while also
examining the power and efficacy of law as a means of achieving
social change. </p>

<p> Desmond Manderson traces the legislative developments, from
the anti-opium laws directed against the Chinese in the
nineteenth century, to the complex web of our present drug laws,
and illustrates the gradual politicisation of the drugs debate.
From Mr Sin to Mr Big argues that Australia's current drug laws
are a product of the past, and it is only by understanding this
past that we can begin a rational debate about reform in the
future. </p>

<p> [note] </p>

<p> Desmond Manderson is a lawyer and historian who has written
extensively on drug history and policy. After studying and
teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra for
several years, he is currently engaged in research at the Centre
for Medicine, Ethics, and Law at McGill University in </p>

<p> Montreal, Canada. [accurate at 1993 : PH] </p>

<p> [summary of the research programs] </p>

<p> As part of his Honours thesis in History, Manderson
researched for a small publication funded by the Research into
Drug Abuse Program (RIDAP) of the National Campaign Against Drug
Abuse (NCADA). </p>

<p> Following his Honours thesis, it was suggested that he work
on a larger project into the history of drug laws in Australia,
again supported by RIDAP, under the Commonwealth (Federal, for
our world audience) Department of Community Services and Health. </p>

<h2>Interesting quotes from the book. </h2>

<p> (page 7) </p>

<p> In nineteenth-century Australia, opium was the preserve of
neither the creative few nor the urban poor. It was freely
available and freely used. Furthermore, perhaps partly as a
consequence of the weakness of the medical profession, the line
which is now seen to divide medical 'use' form non-medical
'abuse' was not yet apparent. Many people who consumed opium
undoubtedly did so out of habit. Indeed, temperance activists who
would rather forfiet their lives than drink a nip of whiskey, but
who were addicted to opium, were the butt of many jokes. 'I
believe the teetotalers have too little pleasure in this world,
whatever they may hope for in the next,' said Godfrey Carter, a
member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly well known for his
opposition to the temperance movement, in 1898, &quot;and when I
think what little joy they have here at present is derived, to a
great extent, from the use of morphine, chlorodyne, painkiller,
and a variety of other preparations of opium, why should we
prevent them from going to their chemists and getting these
things?&quot; </p>

<p> (page 19) </p>

<p> As the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, whose masthead proudly
proclaimed 'Australia for the White Man', stated in 1889: </p>

<p> &quot;The badness of the Chinaman, socially and morally, is
the outcome of his low wages ... If Chinamen will tomorrow refuse
to work for less wages, man for man, than Britons, and will
refuse to work longer hours, the head and front of the objections
to their presence will disappear.&quot; </p>

<p> For the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, the Chinese were
'jaundice-coloured apostles of unlimited competition'. </p>

<p> The proponents of a 'White Australia', however, slid with
ease from arguments of economic protectionism to visceral racism.
The Chinese were painted as living squalidly and in filth, their
habits depraved and their lives degraded. The absence of Chinese
women was seen as a threat to the honor and chastity of innocent
European women and girls (and prostitution certainly flourished
in the Chinatowns of large communities). That the Chinese men
worked on Sundays was portrayed as an indication of the
infiltration of paganism and devil-worshipping into god-fearing
Australian society. In the slandering of the Chinese, almost
anything went, as this extract from a tract written by someone
who went by the ironic pseudonym 'Humanity' shows: </p>

<p> &quot;The Chinese amidst their evil surroundings, and their
filthy and sinful abodes of sin and swinish devilry [will be]
entered into by the servants of the Most High God! May the
wayside scattering of the seed of holiness and truth take root in
the hotbed of all unholy and unclean vices! ... It would never be
believed that our Saxon and Norman girls could have sunk so low
in crime as to consort with such a herd of Gorilla
Devils...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 23-24) </p>

<p> Opium was seen as a pollutant, moral as well as physical; it
was tainted by the environment of its consumption and by its
connections with the Chinese themselves. The potency of these
separate aesthetic revulsions-against dirtiness, the Chinese, and
the smell of opium-was compounded by their mutual association, as
can be seen from the description of an opium den contained in the
'Bulletin's&quot; 1886 feature on 'The Chinese in Australia': </p>

<p> &quot;Down from the fan-tan den are stairs leading to lower
and dirtier abodes: rooms darker than and more greasy than
anything on the ground floor: rooms where the legions of
aggressive stinks peculiar to Chinamen seems to linger ... Yet
the rooms are not naturally repulsive, nor would they be so when
occupied by other tenants; but the Chinaman has defiled their
walls with his filthy touch; he has vitiated what was once a
reasonably pure atmosphere with his presence, and he has polluted
the premises with his disgusting habits; and so it is that nought
save suggestions of evil, incentives of disgust and associations
of vice, now seems to move in the fetid atmosphere ... The very
air of the alley is impregnated with the heavy odour of the
drug.&quot; </p>

<p> From being seen as a dirty habit in dirty people, opium
smoking came to be seen as an immoral habit in hated people. It
was a small step readily taken: from a symbol of depravity, opium
became a cause of it; from a sign of evil, it became an active
agent of it. </p>

<p> (page 32) </p>

<p> Sub-title: 'They all go to the Chinaman': Aboriginal Opium
Laws and the Chinese In fact, the first laws specifically to
prohibit opium did not seem to deal with the Chinese use of it at
all. The Queensland &quot;Sale and Use of Poison Act 1891&quot;
penalised &quot;any person who supplies, or permits to be
supplied, any opium to any aboriginal native of Australia or
half-caste of that race ... except for medicinal purposes
...&quot; </p>

<p> (page 36) </p>

<p> A man named Corbett, 'speaking for all other farmers',
complained that 'they could not get the blacks to work when they
wanted them, while the Chinese', who farmed half of the
surrounding land, could always get them, a fact which he
accounted for by saying that the Celestial paid their Aboriginal
employees in opium'. The solution seemed simple. As the local
carpenter argued, 'the blacks should be taken from the Chinese
and compelled to work for any European who might require their
services'. Opium was, as ever, a scapegoat. The local White
farmers, wanting cheap Black labour, could not understand why
they would rather work for the Chinese. The use of opium was
fastened upon as the only possible explanation for such a
perverse choice. </p>

<p> The more likely truth was that the Chinese treated the
Aboriginal with a modicum of respect. Roth reported the local
police as saying that is the White population ceased starving and
mistreating its Black employees, it could get as many workers as
it wanted. But even the crudest kind of decency appears to have
been beyond some of the locals. A man named Putt expressed his
grievance with incredulity: </p>

<p> &quot;I have shot thirteen or fourteen niggers in this
District and this is all the Government has done for me:-I can't
get a _____ nigger when I want one. They all go to the
Chinaman.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 204-205) </p>

<p> Senator Peter Baume, amongst others, has spoken with more and
more conviction as the years have passed. In one of his last
parliamentary speeches on the subject, before retiring to take up
an appointment as Professor of Community Medicine at the
University of New South Wales, he said: &quot;Our strategies seek
to prevent the production of certain designated illegal
substances, and fail to do so; they seek to prevent the
importation of substances, and fail to do so; they seek to
prevent the distribution of substances, and fail to do so; they
seek to prevent the sale and use of substances, and fail to do
so.&quot; </p>

<p> (page 207) </p>

<p> One thing is apparent. 'Drugs' is a subject which people
approach with many erroneous preconceptions, and a little
knowledge can change people's opinions profoundly. Both Peter
Baume and Peter Cleeland, chairmen of influential parliamentary
committees on the subject, have stressed to me how much their
thinking began to change when they first started to read and to
listen. <br>

<h1>Psychoactive Substances and Violence </h1>

<p> by Jeffrey A. Roth </p>

<p> Series: Research in Brief, US Dept. of Justice </p>

<p> Published: February 1994 </p>

<p> 19 pages </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<h2>Issues and Findings </h2>

<p> Discussed in the Research in Brief: The current status of
research on the links connecting violence to alcohol and illegal
psychoactive drugs, and evaluations of interventions to prevent
violence related to these substances. </p>

<p> Key issues: Correlations between violence and psychoactive
substances; the social, economic, cultural, psycho-social,
neurobehavioral, and other factors that explain the correlations;
and prevention strategies for reducing the violence associated
with these substances. </p>

<h3>Key findings: </h3>

<ul>
    <li>Research has uncovered strong correlations between
        violence and psycho-active substances, including alcohol
        and illegal drugs, but the underlying relationships
        differ by type of drug. </li>
    <li>The links between violence and psychoactive substances
        involve broad social and economic forces, the settings in
        which people obtain and consume the substances, and
        biological processes that underlie all human behavior.
        These factors interact in chains of events that may
        extend back from an intermediate triggering event such as
        an argument to long-term predisposing processes that
        begin in childhood. </li>
    <li>Of all psychoactive substances, alcohol is the only one
        whose consumption has been shown to commonly increase
        aggression. After large doses of amphetamines, cocaine,
        LSD, and PCP, certain individuals may experience violent
        outbursts, probably because of preexisting psychosis.
        Research is needed on the pharmacological effects of
        crack, which enters the brain more directly than cocaine
        used in other forms. </li>
    <li>Alcohol drinking and violence are linked through
        pharmacological effects on behavior, through expectations
        that heavy drinking and violence go together in certain
        settings, and through patterns of binge drinking and
        fighting that sometimes develop in adolescence. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategies for reducing
        alcohol-related violence are to reduce underage drinking
        through substance abuse preventive education, taxes, law
        enforcement, and peer pressure. </li>
    <li>Illegal drugs and violence are linked primarily through
        drug marketing: disputes among rival distributors,
        arguments and robberies involving buyers and sellers,
        property crimes committed to raise drug money and, more
        speculatively, social and economic interactions between
        the illegal markets and the surrounding communities. </li>
    <li>The most promising strategy for reducing violence related
        to illegal drugs appears to be reducing the demand that
        fuels violent illegal markets. Promising tactics include
        preventive education, pretrial monitoring of arrestees
        through urinalysis and, for convicted violent offenders,
        in-prison therapeutic communities integrated with
        postrelease treatment followup. </li>
    <li>In the future, medications may reduce violence by
        reducing cocaine craving and by blocking the
        aggression-promoting effects of opiate withdrawal and
        alcohol consumption. </li>
</ul>

<p> Target audience: State and local policymakers, court
administrators, law enforcement and juvenile justice
practitioners, and drug treatment program staff. </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> As noted by the Panel on the Understanding and Control of
Violent Behavior, the character of violence presents simultaneous
challenges to understanding and opportunities for prevention.
First, violence is diverse. Acts as different as spontaneous
drive-by shootings and met-iculously planned serial killings, for
example, are both included in the legal and statistical category
of murder. Second, the causes of violence are complex, involving
a very wide variety of factors. The panel found it useful to
classify these factors in terms of four levels of analysis at
which they are usually studied: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Broad social and economic forces (macrosocial). </li>
    <li>Encounters between people in particular settings
        (microsocial). </li>
    <li>Individual behavioral development from childhood through
        adulthood (psychosocial). </li>
    <li>Neurobehavioral and other biological processes that
        underlie all human behavior (neurobehavioral). </li>
</ul>

<p> Factors at these four levels operate and interact in chains
of events that may begin long before the violent event that
results. Therefore, the panel's classification framework also
categorized causal factors in terms of their temporal proximity
to the violent event itself: from the immediate triggering
mechanism (for example, a response to an insult), back through
the situation that led up to the triggering event, to
predisposing factors that months or years earlier increased the
risk of a future violent event. </p>

<p> This diversity and complexity might at first glance seem to
discourage efforts to prevent violence. In fact, however, they
create promising opportunities. Merely acknowledging the
diversity breaks the overall &quot;violence problem&quot; into
separate problems that may be preventable through interventions
by different public agencies. Recognizing the causal complexity
expands the list of options for preventing a particular violence
problem by highlighting all the points at which chains of events
leading to it may be breakable. Problem-solving
initiatives--programs that involve design and evaluation of
preventive interventions at various links in these chains of
events, that revise these interventions in light of the
evaluation findings, and that replicate the evaluations--have the
potential to simultaneously reduce violence and increase the
understanding of its causes. </p>

<p> Many chains of causal events for violence include links to
alcohol or to illegal psychoactive drugs. The panel found these
links worth exploring in depth for at least three reasons. First,
statistics consistently demonstrate correlations between violent
events and involvement with alcohol and other psychoactive drugs.
Second, the variety of potential causal links between violence
and different psychoactive substances--alcohol, opiates, cocaine
in smokable and powdered form, amphetamines, hallucinogens, and
other illegal drugs--presents an especially rich example of the
panel's classification framework. Third, preliminary evidence
from research and evaluations suggests that certain interventions
related to psychoactive substances should be considered in
developing strategies for controlling violence. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Correlations between violence and psychoactive substances </h3>

<p> Research supported by the National Institute of Justice and
other organizations has repeatedly found strong correlations
between violence and psychoactive substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>For at least the last several decades, alcohol
        drinking--by the perpetrator of a crime, the victim, or
        both--has immediately preceded at least half of all
        violent events, including murders, in the samples studied
        by researchers. </li>
    <li>Chronic drinkers are more likely than other people to
        have histories of violent behavior. </li>
    <li>Criminals who use illegal drugs1 commit robberies and
        assaults more frequently than do nonuser criminals, and
        they commit them especially frequently during periods of
        heavy drug use. </li>
    <li>In a study of New York City murders in 1988, researchers
        classified more than half the homicides (53 percent) as
        drug-related: 39 percent in the course of drug
        distribution, 8 percent through pharmacological effects
        on the offender, 2 percent while the offender was
        obtaining money to buy drugs, and 4 percent through more
        than one of these links.2 </li>
</ul>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program, which tests for drug use among booked
arrestees in 24 sites nationwide, showed the following patterns
in 1989: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Most males and females who were interviewed after arrest
        for a violent crime reported drinking alcohol within 72
        hours before the crime for which they were arrested. </li>
    <li>About 60 percent of arrestees booked for violent crimes
        were confirmed by laboratory test to have used at least
        one illegal drug3 in the hours before arrest. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Explaining the correlations </h3>

<p> While these statistical patterns strongly suggest that
psychoactive substances play significant roles in acts of
violence, they do not explain the nature of those relationships.
In trying to sort out links between violence and psychoactive
substances, the panel categorized potential links in terms of the
four levels noted above: </p>

<h4>o Social and economic forces (macrosocial): </h4>

<p> Processes that affect large social units such as nations or
communities. Examples include cultural practices related to
alcohol use and, in the United States, economic and social
processes surrounding the illegal markets in which psychoactive
drugs other than alcohol are sold. </p>

<h4>o Encounters between people (microsocial): </h4>

<p> Characteristics of encounters between people. Examples
include group drinking in settings where violence is expected and
socially acceptable; arguments that are begun or aggravated
because the participants are under the influence of drugs or
alcohol; and disputes involving organizations, buyers, and
sellers in illegal drug markets. </p>

<h4>o Psychosocial: </h4>

<p> Influences on individuals' behavior patterns, which begin
developing in early childhood and continue to evolve throughout
adulthood. Examples include patterns of heavy drinking and
aggression that develop during adolescence and psychoses that
predispose a few individuals toward violent psychotic episodes
while under the influence of certain drugs. </p>

<h4>o Neurobehavioral: </h4>

<p> Processes in the brain that underlie all human behavior and
that may be altered by pharmacological effects of alcohol and
other drugs. Examples include effects of substance abuse during
pregnancy on fetal development, effects of chronic substance
abuse on brain functioning, and temporary neurological effects of
being &quot;high&quot; or &quot;blue.&quot; </p>

<p> These and other examples of links at all four levels between
violence and alcohol or other drugs are displayed in table 1.
Much of the evidence for specific links is suggestive rather than
conclusive. One challenge in understanding and verifying the
links is the complexity of interactions among factors at
different levels. It would be difficult at best to sort out such
interactions. What makes the challenge even greater is that most
studies measure factors at only one or two levels at a time, so
that the full range of interactions is rarely observed in a
single study. In addition, it is difficult to study violent
events using methods that yield generalizable conclusions.
Controlled experiments under laboratory conditions produce the
strongest confirmation of factors that influence behavior, but
practical and ethical constraints generally limit those methods
to studies of behaviors that are far milder than the potentially
lethal violence that occurs in homes and communities. At present,
therefore, there are only fragments of scientific evidence
providing partial support for the existence of many causal links
between psychoactive substances and violence. These findings
neither explain definitively how the links interact nor provide a
basis for ranking them in order of importance in explaining
variation in violence related to alcohol or other drugs. </p>

<h5>Neurobehavioral explanations </h5>

<p> Research on humans and many animal species suggests there are
several neurobehavioral links between violence and psychoactive
substances: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Expectant mothers' use of psychoactive substances during
        pregnancy adversely affects fetal development. The
        resultant damage causes learning and communication
        problems that, in turn, increase the risk of early grade
        school failure, a well-documented precursor of violent
        behavior. </li>
    <li>Alcohol is the only psychoactive drug that in many
        individuals tends to increase aggressive behavior
        temporarily while it is taking effect. However, factors
        at other levels--behavior patterns when people are not
        drinking, the setting in which people drink, and local
        drinking customs, for example--influence the strength of
        this relationship. </li>
    <li>Among alcohol abusers, those who also abuse other
        psychoactive substances, who are diagnosed with
        antisocial personality disorder, and whose parents have
        been diagnosed as alcohol abusers are at especially high
        risk of chronic violent behavior. Some researchers have
        suggested that a genetic process may contribute to this
        relatively rare pattern. </li>
    <li>Marijuana and opiates temporarily inhibit violent
        behavior, but withdrawal from opiate addiction tends to
        exaggerate both aggressive and defensive responses to
        provocations. </li>
</ul>

<p> Individual humans and animals deviate widely from these
&quot;average&quot; behaviors. For example, the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol are strongest in animals
having high blood levels of testosterone, the principal male
hormone that distinguishes males from females; humans may or may
not exhibit the same pattern. A study of violent Finnish alcohol
abusers suggests that the alcohol-violence link may be associated
with abnormally low levels of blood sugar (that is, hypoglycemia)
and of metabolites of the brain chemical serotonin. Another study
suggests that the alcohol-violence link is especially strong in
people who exhibit certain abnormal brain wave patterns, both at
rest and while responding to outside stresses. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Common Assumptions Called Into Question </h3>

<p> On the other hand, several common assumptions about
connections between drugs and violence are called into question
by research findings: </p>

<ul>
    <li>There is no evidence to support the claim that snorting
        or injecting cocaine stimulates violent behavior.
        However, research is urgently needed on the behavioral
        effects of smoking cocaine in crack form, which affects
        the brain more directly. </li>
    <li>Anecdotal reports notwithstanding, no research evidence
        supports the notion that becoming high on hallucinogens,
        amphetamines, or PCP stimulates violent behavior in any
        systematic manner. The anecdotes usually describe chronic
        users with histories of psychosis or antisocial behavior,
        which may or may not be related to their chronic use of
        drugs. </li>
    <li>Occasional anecdotes about &quot; 'roid
        rages&quot;--violent outbursts by men who use anabolic
        steroids to accelerate muscle growth--appear to describe
        isolated coincidences rather than any common, systematic
        effect. </li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Psychosocial links </h3>

<p> Evidence from research on animals and humans indicates that
patterns of substance abuse and aggressive behavior reinforce
each other. It cannot be said that one &quot;causes&quot; the
other. For example, alcohol may trigger violent episodes in
aggressive animals and people, but rarely in submissive ones. </p>

<p> Patterns of aggressive behavior and substance abuse often
become intertwined starting in childhood. Early childhood
aggression is a predictor of later heavy drinking, and the
combination is associated with an above-average risk of adult
violent behavior, especially among those who also abuse other
psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p> Research suggests at least four possible explanations for the
link between substance abuse and violent behavior in adolescents.
First, adolescents may chronically use psychoactive substances to
help them temporarily escape from such feelings as rage, guilt,
worthlessness, or depression--emotions that often precede
aggressive behavior. Second, repeated family arguments over
teenage substance abuse may eventually take on a violent
character. Next, underlying family problems or socially expected
responses may lead some adolescent males to patterns of heavy
drinking and fighting as ways to demonstrate their masculinity.
Last, boys who regularly observe older males fighting while
drinking may learn to expect that violent behavior accompanies
alcohol use. All of these processes may be at work, but their
roles, interactions, and importance as explanations have not yet
been sorted out. </p>

<p> Preexisting psychosis appears to account for occasional
violent outbursts by people who are under the influence of
amphetamines or hallucinogens, especially PCP. While these drugs
are well known to cause disorganized, bizarre behavior, they
trigger violence in very few people who are not also psychotic.
In studies of laboratory mice and monkeys, bizarre behavior on
the part of animals under the influence of PCP fairly commonly
provokes violent attacks by others in the group. Anecdotal
information and newspaper accounts report similar attacks on
humans using alcohol, amphetamines, powdered cocaine, or LSD, but
this relationship has not been systematically studied in humans. </p>

<h4>Encounters between people </h4>

<p> In a variety of ways, alcohol and drugs modify encounters
between people in ways that make these substances greater hazards
for violence. In the case of alcohol, these hazards tend to be
related to use, while for illegal psychoactive drugs they tend to
be related to distribution and purchase. </p>

<p> Alcohol use and sexual violence. Some therapists who treat
violent sex offenders have reported that their patients tend to
have both histories of alcohol abuse and high blood levels of
testosterone. Without comparisons to men who are not violent sex
offenders, these clinical observations cannot demonstrate that
alcohol abuse or high testosterone levels cause sexual violence.
Studies of many animal species suggest a causal connection--that
alcohol reduces testosterone levels but has stronger
aggression-promoting effects in individual high-testosterone
animals. However, that relationship has not yet been tested in
humans. The frequent involvement of alcohol in acquaintance rapes
suggests that social expectations may also be at work; that is,
young men who expect to have sex after drinking may try to
satisfy their expectations, sometimes forcibly if they encounter
resistance. </p>

<p> Illegal drug markets. Illegal drug markets operate outside
the world of contract law, courts and mediators for resolving
disputes, and business customs that distinguish socially
acceptable from unac- ceptable approaches to buying and selling.
Illegal markets often develop substitute mechanisms that involve
the threat or actual use of violence. Examples include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Violence by drug distributors in the course of
        territorial disputes between rival organizations, threats
        of violence to make &quot;staff&quot; obey organizational
        rules, violent punishment of rulebreakers to keep the
        threats credible, battles with police, and protection of
        sellers or drugs on the street. </li>
    <li>Violence between buyer and seller during a drug
        transaction, caused, for example, by attempted robbery of
        one or the other, failure to hand over drugs or money, or
        &quot;honest&quot; misunderstandings of local rules of
        the game on the part of buyers and sellers. </li>
    <li>Violence involving people other than buyers and sellers
        who are found around drug markets--third parties such as
        innocent bystanders and people operating in related
        illegal markets for &quot;protection,&quot; guns, or
        prostitution. </li>
</ul>

<p> As places where violence tends to occur for the reasons
listed above, illegal drug markets may also serve as
&quot;magnets.&quot; As such, they attract valuable drugs and
cash, weapons, and people who are accustomed to violence. The mix
of these ingredients creates hazardous conditions for robberies
and other forms of violence that may not be directly related to
drugs. </p>

<p> Obtaining drug purchase money. In some settings, the need for
money to buy drugs also increases the chance of a violent
encounter. A taxi driver carrying a passenger late at night, for
example, is presumably at greater risk of being robbed if the
passenger wants to buy drugs but lacks the cash to do so. While
robbery is still a common way to obtain money to buy drugs, it
has been replaced by drug selling in some large cities. </p>

<p> Using alcohol and drugs. If alcohol caused violence only by
making individuals behave more aggressively, violence would be
equally common in all places where drinking occurs. In fact,
however, most drinking places are rarely scenes of violence. A
few acquire reputations as &quot;animal houses&quot; or
&quot;fighting bars,&quot; where people expect drinking and
violence to go hand in hand. </p>

<p> Just what characteristics of a drinking place make it a
hazard for violence are not precisely known, but there is
supporting evidence for several possible explanations. People who
drink in fighting bars may behave violently in order to &quot;fit
in&quot; or to advance socially. People who experience anger or
frustration may seek out such settings, because they believe that
drinking in these types of establishments means social permission
to engage in violent behavior. One study of a group of young men
who were observed during an evening of drinking illustrates this
by suggesting that behavior patterns and situational influences
may play off each other. As the evening progressed, the group
began both to behave more aggressively and to move on to
establishments where aggressive behavior was more socially
acceptable. </p>

<p> Connections between drinking and violence have been
identified by researchers in many countries with predominantly
European cultures. But they have not been found in many tribal
and folk societies, even where binge drinking is common. For
reasons not yet known, expectations that violence follows
drinking have failed to develop in those cultures. </p>

<p> Finally, it seems likely that substance abuse is indirectly
related to violence in ways that are difficult to identify and
count. Examples of indirect relationships include robberies
committed to replace household money spent on drugs or alcohol,
or spouse assaults arising from disputes over money or time spent
away from home drinking or taking drugs. </p>

<p> Violence is related to the distribution, purchase, and use of
illegal drugs or alcohol in a wide variety of human interactions.
Unfortunately, the difficulty of counting such interactions makes
it also difficult to rank them in order of importance. Better
counts would help in focusing violence prevention strategies on
the most common interactions in which drug- and alcohol-related
violence occurs. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h3>

<h3>Social and economic forces </h3>

<p> If the patterns of behavior discussed above were the only
links between illegal drug distribution and violence, every city
that experienced a crack epidemic in the 1980's would also have
seen a substantial increase in homicide at the same time. Indeed,
policymakers have occasionally claimed a &quot;uniform, straight
line relationship&quot; between illegal drug use and murder.4 </p>

<p> The reality is more complex. The murder rate increased 350
percent in Washington, D.C., and by a smaller amount in New York
City as their crack epidemics unfolded. However, during the crack
epidemics in Detroit and Los Angeles these cities experienced
decreases in the murder rate. This suggests that the
relationships between illegal drug market activity and lethal
violence are intertwined with social and economic processes in
the surrounding community. </p>

<p> What are these processes? Because causal patterns at the
social level are especially difficult to establish, the answers
are necessarily speculative. Fragments of evidence suggest that
some or all of the following factors may influence the
relationship between levels of violence and illegal drug market
activity: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Stability of drug market control: Situations that produce
        violent encounters--fights over territorial allocations
        or misunderstandings between buyers and sellers, for
        example--arose relatively infrequently in markets
        controlled by old, stable organizations that had
        developed operating rules decades ago and enforced them
        through a standing threat to punish violators violently.
        Where the spread of crack manufacturing technology
        encouraged new organizations to enter the markets, the
        resulting destabilization may temporarily have increased
        the frequency of violent encounters. </li>
    <li>Community access to legitimate economic opportunities:
        Where the rise of crack markets followed the exodus of
        legitimate economic opportunities from central cities,
        economic rewards shifted away from skills valued by
        legitimate employers to those valued by crack
        distribution organizations; these included the ability to
        threaten and use violence. </li>
    <li>Strength of informal violence controls: Where the exodus
        of legitimate economic opportunities from urban
        communities took with it many people committed to legal,
        nonviolent values, those people were no longer available
        for roles in preventing drug-related violence. They were
        not available, for example, as nonviolent role models for
        adolescents, as passers-by who might discourage drug
        buyers or intervene in emerging violent events, or as
        concerned individuals who might inform parents if their
        children began drifting toward involvement in drug
        markets. </li>
    <li>Social status and moral authority: During crack epidemics
        in some communities, successful young drug entrepreneurs
        either supplanted or intimidated neighborhood &quot;old
        heads&quot;--unofficial community leaders who upheld
        traditional values and had exercised moral authority in
        the neighborhood. Where this occurred, it tended to
        weaken cultural restraints against violence in all
        contexts, including drug markets. </li>
</ul>

<p> Because such relationships are difficult to verify, evidence
supporting their influence is only suggestive and fragmentary,
and new research is needed to explore them more fully. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Preventive interventions </h2>

<p> A number of intervention strategies for preventing violence
related to psychoactive substances have been proposed: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Police disruption of illegal drug markets. </li>
    <li>Selectively longer incarceration of violent drug-using
        criminals. </li>
    <li>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol. </li>
    <li>Substance abuse prevention. </li>
    <li>Drug abuse treatment. </li>
    <li>Pharmacological therapies to reduce drug craving and
        aggressive tendencies associated with alcohol use and
        heroin addiction. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some of these strategies have been evaluated to test their
effectiveness in reducing violence. Only a few have demonstrated
success under any conditions; none have shown universal
effectiveness. Developing better interventions will require
collaborative problem-solving initiatives that involve
representatives of criminal justice agencies, providers of
substance abuse treatment and other social services, and
evaluation researchers. These initiatives are needed to turn
promising ideas into workable programs, to evaluate the programs,
and to refine them in light of the evaluation results. The
findings of evaluations conducted thus far are summarized in the
following sections. </p>

<p> <strong>Disrupting illegal drug markets.</strong> Police
attack illegal drug markets through a number of tactics:
undercover investigations leading to dealers' arrests;
cooperation with community antidrug efforts; and large-scale,
high-visibility crackdowns. Evaluations of these tactics in
Birmingham, Alabama; Lawrence and Lynn, Massachusetts; New York
City; Oakland, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and
Washington, D.C., present a mixed picture. Perhaps the strongest
supportable statement is that their chance of success is improved
by intervening early in emerging markets, by creating a highly
committed police force, and by generating community receptivity
and cooperation in advance. NIJ's Drug Market Analysis (DMA)
program is helping with the first prerequisite--early detection
of drug markets. Specific techniques for creating supportive
climates in police departments and the surrounding communities
are less well understood, although many approaches are now being
tested as part of community policing initiatives. </p>

<p> <strong>Incarcerating violent drug-using criminals. </strong>Researchers
have generally found that compared to other violent offenders,
those who use drugs tend to have higher average frequencies of
violent crimes such as robbery and assault. This finding raises
the possibility that sentencing drug-involved offenders who are
convicted of these crimes to longer prison terms might reduce
violence. However, analyses suggest that this strategy of
&quot;selective incapacitation&quot; would reduce violent crime
levels very little unless it were accompanied by massive
increases in prison populations. </p>

<p> <strong>A related strategy--monitoring pretrial releasees'
drug use through urinalysis</strong>--showed rather surprising
effects in a Washington, D.C., evaluation. Although positive drug
test results did not predict significantly higher pretrial
rearrest rates, failure to show up for the test was a strong
predictor of subsequent new crimes leading to rearrest. </p>

<p> <strong>Reducing teenagers' access to alcohol.</strong>
Evidence is fairly clear that increases in tax rates and other
measures that reduce the availability of alcohol to adolescents
(social pressure and enforcement of underage drinking laws) in
turn reduce drinking and certain associated problems such as
death rates due to auto collisions. Therefore, these strategies
may also reduce adolescents' disproportionate share of violence.
That conjecture remains to be tested, however. </p>

<p> <strong>Substance abuse prevention. </strong>By reducing the
demand that fuels violent, illegal drug markets, substance abuse
prevention should, in theory, reduce violence levels. Many
substance abuse prevention programs have been evaluated,
including the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), which
brings police officers into classrooms as instructors.
Evaluations of prevention programs have generally found them
effective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and
marijuana use. Evaluations have not generally found that
education succeeds in preventing use of &quot;harder&quot; drugs,
perhaps because use of those drugs was rare even in the control
groups that did not receive preventive education. However, to the
extent that minor drugs are &quot;stepping stones&quot; to the
harder ones,5 the programs may have meaningful, yet delayed,
effects for violence reduction. </p>

<p> <strong>Prevention</strong> may have an especially important
role to play for one category of adolescents--males whose
behavior meets diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality
disorder and whose parents abuse alcohol. Research indicates that
these two factors, coupled with both alcohol and drug abuse,
create a high-risk profile for violent behavior in adulthood. </p>

<p> <strong>Drug abuse treatment</strong>. Successful drug
treatment programs reduce criminal activity among adult clients.
For drug abusers who are not in prison, stays of at least 3
months in therapeutic communities reduce the tendency to commit
crime after discharge. Up to about 18 months, longer stays in the
therapeutic community produce greater reductions. </p>

<p> For drug abusers in prison, treatment usually involves only
individual or group sessions a few times a week with no
postrelease followup. Evaluations of this approach have not found
it sufficient to reduce criminal behavior following release.
However, a more intensive approach--combining inprison
therapeutic communities, planning for postrelease treatment, and
postrelease treatment in the community--reduces overall rearrest
rates of inmates who complete the program. At least three
programs have used this approach: Stay 'n Out (in a New York
prison), Cornerstone (in the Oregon State Hospital), and the
California Civil Addict Program. </p>

<p> In addition to these beneficial effects of drug treatment on
offenders' behavior, successful treatment may reduce aggregate
levels of violence related to drug markets by lowering the demand
that fuels the markets. Such an effect would, however, be
difficult to measure. </p>

<p> <strong>Pharmacological interventions.</strong> Like other
forms of drug treatment, pharmacological therapies that reduce
drug craving may also lower the demand that supports violent drug
markets. For decades, methadone and related chemicals have been
used to reduce craving for heroin. There is no analogue to
methadone for treating addiction to cocaine in powdered or
smokable form. However, using animals as test subjects,
researchers have identified the receptors for certain subtypes of
two brain chemicals, dopamine and norepinephrine, as promising
sites to begin developing such medications. Animal research also
suggests neurochemical starting points for developing medications
that reduce violence in other ways: by disrupting the
aggression-promoting effects of alcohol and by preventing
aggression during withdrawal from heroin addiction. </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p> Too few of the links between violence and psychoactive
substances have been established with enough certainty to
advocate a comprehensive national policy for preventing violence
related to those substances. Instead, a program of testing and
evaluating tactics for implementing a variety of promising
strategies is called for. Among these strategies, criminal
justice agencies have particular roles in developing and testing
tactics to disrupt illegal drug markets, in monitoring drug use
of pretrial releasees, in establishing drug abuse treatment for
convicted criminals, and in creating effective substance abuse
prevention programs. Fulfilling these roles will require
cooperation between the criminal justice system and drug
treatment, prevention, and education authorities. Eventually,
efforts to prevent drug-related violence may be assisted by
pharmacological therapies to reduce the aggression-promoting
effects of alcohol and the craving for other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<h2>Notes </h2>

<p> 1. Among studies of this relationship, many group all illegal
drugs together. Those that distinguish among drugs usually list
cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, barbiturates, and hallucinogens
other than marijuana. See, for example, Elliott, D.S., and D.
Huizinga, The Relationship Between Delinquent Behavior and ADM

<p> 3. The DUF program uses urinalysis to confirm self-reports.
The urine specimens are tested for cocaine, opiates, marijuana,
PCP, methadone, benzodiazepine (Valium), methaqualone,
propoxyphene (Darvon), barbiturates, and amphetamines. Samples
are collected at the time of arrest on a voluntary basis; an
average of 80 percent of arrestees voluntarily cooperate. Test
criteria are set to detect use of most drugs in the preceding 24
to 48 hours, but marijuana and PCP can be detected in the urine
several weeks after use. </p>

<p> 5. Until recently, research on developmental pathways
consistently found these drugs to be &quot;gateways&quot; or
&quot;stepping stones&quot; to cocaine use. Preliminary findings,
presented after the Panel completed its report, suggest that
since the New York City &quot;crack epidemic&quot; of the early
1980's, crack-using youth in increasing numbers are skipping the
gateway drugs and starting directly with crack. </p>

<p> Author's Biography </p>

<p> Dr. Jeffrey A. Roth served as study director for the Panel on
the Under-standing and Control of Violent Behavior. Currently he
is research director in the Bethesda, Maryland, office of the Law
and Public Policy area of Abt Associates, Inc. </p>

<p> Sidebar 1 </p>

<p> Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior </p>

<p> Violence is universally recognized as a pervasive part of
contemporary American society and of our Nation's past as well.
Many of the attempts to understand the phenomenon have been made
in response to specific situations, such as the lawlessness of
the Prohibition era, the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, and the urban riots of the mid-1960's. Other attempts at
understanding violence singled out particular causes for
analysis. In none of these studies, however, was the full body of
research on violence reviewed comprehensively, and none of them
took an interdisciplinary approach. </p>

<p> The Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent
Behavior was set up to meet the need for a more comprehensive
assessment of what is known about violent behavior. It was
established in response to a request made by three Federal
agencies: the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Institute of Justice (NIJ), and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). NSF asked for a review of current knowledge
about the causes of violent behavior and recommendations for
future research. The other two agencies shared these goals, but
their areas of interest reflected their particular missions. As
the research arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, NIJ wanted to
find out about means to prevent and control violent crime. The
CDC wanted assistance in setting priorities for preventing
injuries and deaths caused by violence. </p>

<p> Created in 1989, the panel reviewed research on
&quot;interpersonal violence&quot;--events involving at most a
few perpetrators and victims. This limitation excluded suicide
and self-mutilation as well as large-scale collective and State
violence. The focus was on describing, understanding, and
controlling violence in the United States. Research in
biomedical, psychological, and other social sciences was
reviewed. The work of the panel was intended both to help guide
future research and evaluation projects aimed at prevention and
control and to suggest strategic directions for violence control
policy. </p>

<p> The findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the panel
were published in Volume 1 of Understanding and Preventing
Violence, published by the National Academy Press. Three volumes
of background papers commissioned by the panel are forthcoming.
The panel concluded that numerous, often interacting factors give
rise to violent events. Although the underlying interactions are
not well understood, attention to the factors suggests many
promising preventive interventions. Testing and evaluating these
interventions creates opportunities to prevent particular types
of violence while gaining better understanding of them. The panel
made recommendations in a number of areas, among them development
of problem-solving initiatives to control and understand
violence; better statistical systems for measuring violence; and
a program of research to identify underlying causes. This
Research in Brief is one of a series that summarizes the panel's
findings. </p>

<p> NIJ is committed to implementing the recommendations of the
panel. Its commitment has begun through support for the Program
on Human Development and Criminal Behavior, a longitudinal,
multicommunity research project that is exploring the factors
associated with violence. In addition, the panel's
recommendations have helped shape the goals of NIJ research and
evaluation activities and its long-range plans for research. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 1 </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is currently the
Nation's predominant school-based drug prevention program, and
both its prevalence and popularity continue to expand. The
D.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,
alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officers
in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.
Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborative
venture, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directed
toward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usually
grade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, and
for parents have been developed and implemented. </p>

<p> Purpose of the Study </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinary
growth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotal
reports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of its
preeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, and
parents are asking a number of fundamental questions about the
program: </p>

<p> o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? </p>

<p> o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of other
school-based drug prevention programs? </p>

<p> o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.
programs? </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? </p>

<p> o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? </p>

<p> o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs compare
with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? </p>

<p> To address these and other questions, the National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the Research
Triangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Center
for Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensive
review of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within the
context of the broad spectrum of school-based drug prevention
efforts. </p>

<p> Study Objectives </p>

<p> The research team proposed and carried out two distinct types
of assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and the
second to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives of
the implementation assessment were to </p>

<p> o assess the organizational structure and operation of
representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; </p>

<p> o review and assess factors that contribute to the effective
implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and </p>

<p> o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention
programs are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. </p>

<p> The first two objectives for the implementation assessment
relate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. but
also includes other drug use prevention programs. </p>

<p> The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to </p>

<p> o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core
curriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; </p>

<p> o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; </p>

<p> o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'s
core curriculum; and </p>

<p> o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum
with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs
targeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. </p>

<p> Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessment
focus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in a
larger context by comparing it with other drug prevention
programs. </p>

<p> In this report, we synthesize the most important findings
from both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, and
some recommendations. </p>

<p> Description of the Study </p>

<p> To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the research
team designed a set of research strategies that would yield data
pertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but also
to an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-based
drug prevention programs, and of future directions for these
programs. </p>

<p> For the implementation assessment, we collected original data
by conducting </p>

<p> o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinators
and/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training
Centers (RTCs); </p>

<p> o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and </p>

<ul>
    <li>a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a
        representative, stratified sample of school districts
        that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. </li>
    <li>We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools
        (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did
        not). We discuss the methodologies used for each
        component of the implementation assessment in Section II
        of this report. </li>
</ul>

<p> For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted a
review and assessment of the published and unpublished
evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. We
collected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.
evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies we
used for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III of
this report. </p>

<p> At the conclusion of our data collection and analysis
efforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the University
of California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 to
host a conference in San Diego, California, titled
&quot;Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Other Drugs.&quot; Almost an entire day of this
3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners
centered on the preliminary results from this study. This
conference provided an opportunity to disseminate early study
findings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,
and to incorporate participants' responses (including responses
from D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drug
prevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. </p>

<p> Strengths and Limitations of the Study </p>

<p> We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive to
NIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach are
the following: </p>

<p> o a multifaceted study methodology that collected information
from the national, regional, State, and school district levels of
D.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.
core curricula conducted to date; </p>

<p> o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results of
previous evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and </p>

<p> o incorporation into this final report of both formal and
informal feedback from researchers and practitioners attending
the dissemination conference. </p>

<p> However, we recognize that there are limitations to our
study, due primarily to limitations in the resources available to
us. For example, our study budget would not allow us to survey
local D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor the
delivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, some
questions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relating
to the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. training
centers, could be answered only in part. A complete answer would
have required a many-layered study that examined training
centers' objectives, how these objectives are put into effect
through training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.
officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in the
classroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. We
also were limited in assessing certain questions, such as
variability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by the
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because of
the lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for further
details). </p>

<p> Given the level of resources available for this study, the
research design required some compromises among the multiple
objectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,
and program strategies. </p>

<p> However, the research team believes that the study represents
an optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.
Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory
Board and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. training
centers, when combined with information gathered from the survey
of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questions
relating specifically to the structure and operations of the
D.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug prevention
coordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and its
relationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. The
site visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,
snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorous
examination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information on
the effects of the program on students. </p>

<p> Overview of the Report </p>

<p> This report is organized into four sections and four
appendices. Section I contains the first two chapters, which
provide an overview and history of school-based drug prevention
programs, with detailed information about the curricula and
teachers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Section II has four chapters that present the methodologies
and results of each of the four components of the implementation
assessment. In these four chapters, we present information about
the national/regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 3),
State-level operations of D.A.R.E. (Chapter 4), and the
implementation of D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs at
the local level (Chapters 5 and 6). </p>

<p> Section III (Chapter 7) presents the methodology and results
of the outcome assessment. In Section IV (Chapter 8), we
synthesize and discuss findings from both the implementation and
outcome assessments, and present recommendations. </p>

<p> Appendix A contains sampling information for the school
district drug prevention coordinators survey. </p>

<p> Appendix B contains descriptions of each study utilized in
the meta-analysis conducted for the outcome assessment. Appendix
C presents a bibliography of comparison program evaluations, and
Appendix D contains data collection materials for the
implementation assessment. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 2 </p>

<p> OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS
AND D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-based
educational programs are the most common approach to drug
prevention aimed at young people. </p>

<p> Prevention efforts are located in educational settings </p>

<p> both because drug use typically begins during adolescence </p>

<p> and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for </p>

<p> reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 </p>

<p> Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally </p>

<p> have been declining over the past few years (University </p>

<p> of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than </p>

<p> rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 </p>

<p> The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth </p>

<p> drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and </p>

<p> Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed </p>

<p> to establish programs of drug abuse education and </p>

<p> prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the </p>

<p> DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal </p>

<p> money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or </p>

<p> expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from </p>

<p> Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single </p>

<p> largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal </p>

<p> Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 </p>

<p> Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the </p>

<p> implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA </p>

<p> found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, </p>

<p> the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto </p>

<p> Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the </p>

<p> DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school </p>

<p> districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received </p>

<p> DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or </p>

<p> county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, </p>

<p> Hayward, &amp; Ringwalt, 1991). </p>

<p> The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive </p>

<p> effect on the school-based prevention programs of school </p>

<p> districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools </p>

<p> must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding </p>

<p> reported that since the advent of such support, they had </p>

<p> been able to expand or increase numerous aspects of their </p>

<p> programs, including=20 </p>

<p> o number of grade levels with </p>

<p> substance abuse curricula, </p>

<p> o school-wide emphasis on substance </p>

<p> abuse prevention,=20 </p>

<p> o number of teachers and staff </p>

<p> involved, and=20 </p>

<p> o number of students involved. =20 </p>

<p> A total of 25% of these districts had increased their </p>

<p> curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased </p>

<p> their degree of involvement with other groups in the </p>

<p> community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more </p>

<p> limited in the future. </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Strategies </p>

<p> A variety of school-based intervention programs </p>

<p> have been developed over the past three decades for </p>

<p> preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, </p>

<p> 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, &amp; </p>

<p> Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs </p>

<p> differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how </p>

<p> they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program </p>

<p> content generally reflects assumptions about why young </p>

<p> people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- </p>

<p> esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk </p>

<p> factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to </p>

<p> refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer </p>

<p> pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods </p>

<p> implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about </p>

<p> the most effective means for teaching young people not to </p>

<p> use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a </p>

<p> traditional expert model for learning; programs that </p>

<p> emphasize group activities reflect the belief that </p>

<p> participatory activities enhance understanding and </p>

<p> learning more effectively. </p>

<p> Although hundreds of individual school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs have been developed, they generally </p>

<p> fall into three broad categories:=20 </p>

<p> (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective </p>

<p> programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth </p>

<p> category of prevention programs, alternative programs, </p>

<p> includes those usually offered outside the school </p>

<p> setting. Knowledge/information and affective education </p>

<p> programs have sometimes been grouped together as more </p>

<p> traditional approaches, while social influences programs </p>

<p> represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to </p>

<p> differ in content, in methods, and in their </p>

<p> effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. </p>

<p> Knowledge/information programs were the earliest </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These </p>

<p> strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin </p>

<p> using drugs because they are not sufficiently </p>

<p> knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth </p>

<p> have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is </p>

<p> assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not </p>

<p> to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in </p>

<p> knowledge about drugs will promote more negative </p>

<p> attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a </p>

<p> deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically </p>

<p> present factual information about the legal, biological, </p>

<p> and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these </p>

<p> programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks </p>

<p> of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods </p>

<p> used by knowledge/information programs typically include </p>

<p> didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual </p>

<p> presentations. </p>

<p> Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s </p>

<p> and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that </p>

<p> young people use drugs because of personal and social </p>

<p> deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- </p>

<p> esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, </p>

<p> making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal </p>

<p> skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use </p>

<p> at all. By enriching personal and social development, it </p>

<p> is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions </p>

<p> about drug use. These programs typically are taught by </p>

<p> the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information </p>

<p> programs, but they also may include group activities. </p>

<p> Social influences programs are the most recent </p>

<p> approach to drug use among youth. These programs are </p>

<p> based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they </p>

<p> do not have the social competencies needed to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus </p>

<p> specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for </p>

<p> resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize </p>

<p> developing more general social competencies, such as </p>

<p> increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and </p>

<p> reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific </p>

<p> social skills. They may also include activities to </p>

<p> correct misperceptions about the prevalence and </p>

<p> acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as </p>

<p> activities that seek to establish conservative group </p>

<p> norms about drug use. Social influences programs </p>

<p> typically include active, participatory learning </p>

<p> experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and </p>

<p> practicing behavioral skills. Social influence </p>

<p> strategies also frequently and actively involve &quot;peers </p>

<p> leaders&quot; as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate </p>

<p> discussion. </p>

<p> Despite the differences across program categories, </p>

<p> there is actually much overlap among school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs in their components. Affective </p>

<p> programs share similarities with some social influences </p>

<p> programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing </p>

<p> personal competencies. Social influences programs </p>

<p> frequently include information about drugs and adverse </p>

<p> consequences. Some programs include elements of all </p>

<p> three categories of programs and have been labeled </p>

<p> comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based </p>

<p> curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that </p>

<p> reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social </p>

<p> influences programs. </p>

<p> Research on the effectiveness of school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs suggests that all three program </p>

<p> strategies are not equally successful in preventing </p>

<p> adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information </p>

<p> programs generally have not been effective in preventing </p>

<p> drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, </p>

<p> although information-based programs may increase </p>

<p> students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result </p>

<p> in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In </p>

<p> fact, some research indicates that these programs may </p>

<p> lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not </p>

<p> performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, </p>

<p> Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that </p>

<p> students who received an affective education program </p>

<p> reported significantly more drug use than students in a </p>

<p> comparison group and that these differences increased </p>

<p> over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of </p>

<p> social influences programs have been generally more </p>

<p> positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; </p>

<p> Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In </p>

<p> comparison with knowledge/information and affective </p>

<p> programs, social influences programs have been more </p>

<p> effective at preventing adolescent drug use. </p>

<p> History of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program </p>

<p> designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, </p>

<p> and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed </p>

<p> toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school </p>

<p> (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which </p>

<p> youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and </p>

<p> before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was </p>

<p> developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist </p>

<p> from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention </p>

<p> programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and </p>

<p> Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by </p>

<p> the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University </p>

<p> of Southern California. =20 </p>

<p> From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a </p>

<p> continuing education program for kindergarten through </p>

<p> high school. To that end, junior high and senior high </p>

<p> curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent </p>

<p> curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent </p>

<p> drug use among youth and to provide them with information </p>

<p> about the program. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed </p>

<p> police officers in the classroom to teach a highly </p>

<p> structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the </p>

<p> classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement </p>

<p> between the local school district and law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, but also because the community is willing to </p>

<p> forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to </p>

<p> other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- </p>

<p> 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 </p>

<p> students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, </p>

<p> 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout </p>

<p> the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to </p>

<p> the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United </p>

<p> States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities </p>

<p> across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in </p>

<p> Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental </p>

<p> agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department </p>

<p> of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the </p>

<p> Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all </p>

<p> overseas branches of the Department of Defense. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots </p>

<p> effort with a high degree of centralized program control </p>

<p> asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, </p>

<p> regional, and State levels. At the national level, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for </p>

<p> implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs </p>

<p> that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 </p>

<p> A detailed examination of the roles of national, </p>

<p> regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented </p>

<p> in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Curricula </p>

<p> The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> for students are to </p>

<p> o teach students to recognize pressures </p>

<p> to use drugs from peers and from the </p>

<p> media, </p>

<p> o teach students the skills to resist </p>

<p> peer inducements to use drugs, </p>

<p> o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 </p>

<p> o teach positive alternatives to </p>

<p> substance use, and </p>

<p> o increase students' interpersonal, </p>

<p> communication, and decision-making </p>

<p> skills (BJA, 1991a). </p>

<p> Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated </p>

<p> version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot </p>

<p> tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A </p>

<p> brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> follows. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in </p>

<p> the 5th or 6th grade, comprises </p>

<p> 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have </p>

<p> sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, </p>

<p> although classroom teachers are encouraged to </p>

<p> participate. Officers use a variety of teaching </p>

<p> approaches, including the presentation of facts, group </p>

<p> discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 </p>

<p> The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be </p>

<p> fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum </p>

<p> differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 </p>

<p> The new curriculum, which has been renamed &quot;D.A.R.E. to </p>

<p> Resist Drugs and Violence,&quot; </p>

<p> o includes specific lessons concerning </p>

<p> tobacco and inhalants, </p>

<p> o emphasizes normative beliefs and </p>

<p> protective factors, </p>

<p> o adds violence prevention/conflict </p>

<p> resolution strategies, </p>

<p> o uses more participatory learning </p>

<p> activities, and </p>

<p> o employs a more collaborative </p>

<p> partnership between the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer and the teacher in the </p>

<p> classroom (Charles Dunn, personal </p>

<p> communication, June 22, 1993). </p>

<p> In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, </p>

<p> the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts </p>

<p> introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of </p>

<p> lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented </p>

<p> in sequence and without variation. </p>

<p> The data collection for the implementation </p>

<p> assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome </p>

<p> assessment occurred before the introduction of the new </p>

<p> curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to </p>

<p> provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 </p>

<p> presents a summary of the original version of the core </p>

<p> curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, </p>

<p> and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated </p>

<p> curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, officers may also visit students in </p>

<p> kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief </p>

<p> introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this </p>

<p> curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of </p>

<p> taking medicine and using drugs, saying &quot;no&quot; when
asked </p>

<p> to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about </p>

<p> feelings. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was </p>

<p> originally developed to provide or </p>

<p> reinforce information and skills that help students </p>

<p> resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in </p>

<p> 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, </p>

<p> and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught </p>

<p> cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 </p>

<p> The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) </p>

<p> are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a </p>

<p> required course, such as health, science, or social </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> The senior high school curriculum also focuses on </p>

<p> drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people </p>

<p> (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The </p>

<p> senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught </p>

<p> over an 11-day period during health or another </p>

<p> appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the </p>

<p> lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and </p>

<p> are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Because of the difficulties educators have </p>

<p> continually faced persuading parents to attend school </p>

<p> educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was </p>

<p> designed to be </p>

<p> implemented where parents live and work. This curriculum </p>

<p> consists of four or five 2-hour Exhibit 2.1 D.A.R.E.'s

<p> provides an </p>

<p> ideas on </p>

<p> resources and </p>

<p> referrals </p>

<p> sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 </p>

<p> for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this </p>

<p> curriculum include developing better skills to interact </p>

<p> with children, learning about peer pressures, and </p>

<p> identifying signs and reducing risks of potential </p>

<p> substance abuse. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Officers and Training </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable </p>

<p> discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police </p>

<p> officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at </p>

<p> least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate </p>

<p> officers, local police departments are encouraged to </p>

<p> consider the officer's ability to interact with children, </p>

<p> ability to organize, and ability to handle the </p>

<p> unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide </p>

<p> an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, </p>

<p> stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 </p>

<p> Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week </p>

<p> course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are </p>

<p> trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in </p>

<p> public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom </p>

<p> management. Their performance is directly critiqued by </p>

<p> assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially </p>

<p> trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and </p>

<p> consultants are also used to instruct the officers in </p>

<p> areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist </p>

<p> may present information on the stages of child </p>

<p> development). The core curriculum training course </p>

<p> includes opportunities to practice lessons both with </p>

<p> peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 </p>

<p> Additional training is provided for officers </p>

<p> teaching the junior and senior high school and parent </p>

<p> curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are </p>

<p> required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to </p>

<p> have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 </p>

<p> In-service training is provided to review what officers </p>

<p> have previously learned in light of their actual </p>

<p> classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes </p>

<p> to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit </p>

<p> to the program varies considerably from one law </p>

<p> enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, </p>

<p> particularly those in large urban departments, teaching </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that </p>

<p> serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the </p>

<p> program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of </p>

<p> their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 </p>

<p> Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is </p>

<p> monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations </p>

<p> and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input </p>

<p> from school administrators, classroom teachers, health </p>

<p> education coordinators, and advisory committees to </p>

<p> provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use </p>

<p> Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based </p>

<p> on several preexisting school-based drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising </p>

<p> that the curricula closely resemble other programs in </p>

<p> content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core </p>

<p> curriculum includes lessons that represent all three </p>

<p> curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in the structure by which it is </p>

<p> organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> implemented by law enforcement officers; most other </p>

<p> programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; </p>

<p> most drug prevention program training for teachers is of </p>

<p> a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are </p>

<p> strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, </p>

<p> departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson </p>

<p> plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at </p>

<p> will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most </p>

<p> salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention </p>

<p> material into their general education curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully </p>

<p> monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability </p>

<p> mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their </p>

<p> curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug </p>

<p> prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often </p>

<p> only part of a larger curriculum. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 3 </p>

<p> NATIONAL AND REGIONAL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In any consideration of the organization of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national and regional levels, it is </p>

<p> important to remember that D.A.R.E. is very much a grass- </p>

<p> roots program. In essence, it is a product of memoranda </p>

<p> of understanding between community law enforcement and </p>

<p> local public school districts across the Nation. The </p>

<p> primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in </p>

<p> this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; </p>

<p> to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, </p>

<p> coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to </p>

<p> provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. </p>

<p> As we have said, in its degree of organization at </p>

<p> the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs </p>

<p> greatly from other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, most of which limit their activities to </p>

<p> delivering packaged curricula to school districts and </p>

<p> offering some level of training to teachers. In </p>

<p> contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects </p>

<p> of the prevention program, including the consistency with </p>

<p> which it is implemented in the classroom. In this </p>

<p> chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its </p>

<p> relationship with the </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; </p>

<p> o State Training Centers, State Charter </p>

<p> Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Coordinators; </p>

<p> o Los Angeles United School District </p>

<p> (LAUSD); and </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board. </p>

<p> We obtained much of the information for this chapter from </p>

<p> an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, </p>

<p> Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information </p>

<p> is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also </p>

<p> summarize a series of loosely structured interviews </p>

<p> conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and </p>

<p> local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit </p>

<p> organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has responsibility for a variety of key func- </p>

<p> tions, including </p>

<p> o administering the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o providing educational materials to </p>

<p> communities implementing D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training </p>

<p> and ensuring its consistency, </p>

<p> o improving the curriculum, and </p>

<p> o providing support to D.A.R.E. both </p>

<p> nationally and internationally. =20 </p>

<p> In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish </p>

<p> the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the </p>

<p> following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, </p>

<p> California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and </p>

<p> the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit </p>

<p> 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the </p>

<p> accreditation of State-level training centers. In </p>

<p> addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted </p>

<p> curriculum is taught as specified. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the five RTCs, together with </p>

<p> staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular </p>

<p> development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is </p>

<p> expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed </p>

<p> to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to </p>

<p> support the RTCs. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In </p>

<p> more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has </p>

<p> helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is </p>

<p> designed to support the program in that State. The board </p>

<p> of the chartered organization typically comprises the </p>

<p> State's attorney general, the superintendent of </p>

<p> education, and prominent business and education people.=20 </p>

<p> The board of directors may also include a representative </p>

<p> of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described </p>

<p> below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It </p>

<p> is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter </p>

<p> organizations in the remaining States. In those States </p>

<p> that currently lack a charter organization, there is </p>

<p> typically some individual identified as the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This </p>

<p> person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate </p>

<p> selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> providing local technical assistance, and overseeing </p>

<p> policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with </p>

<p> the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. </p>

<p> In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations </p>

<p> at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have </p>

<p> developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of </p>

<p> which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. These centers are differentially accredited; </p>

<p> all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in </p>

<p> the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to </p>

<p> teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 </p>

<p> The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America. The level of activity of these centers varies </p>

<p> considerably given the size of the State and demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some </p>

<p> 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the </p>

<p> copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated </p>

<p> slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable </p>

<p> intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all </p>

<p> materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to </p>

<p> promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the </p>

<p> organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to </p>

<p> exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco </p>

<p> products. =20 </p>

<p> Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the </p>

<p> copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of </p>

<p> the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community </p>

<p> and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a </p>

<p> local school district has improperly modified the </p>

<p> curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving </p>

<p> the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb </p>

<p> Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse </p>

<p> (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally </p>

<p> the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush </p>

<p> Administration's White House Office of National Drug </p>

<p> Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention </p>

<p> specialists from across the Nation. </p>

<p> The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to </p>

<p> improve communications among police officers within </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of </p>

<p> the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> although those association are not formally a part of the </p>

<p> national association. However, all associations, both </p>

<p> domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for </p>

<p> guidance in matters of policy. </p>

<p> Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable </p>

<p> support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form </p>

<p> of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct </p>

<p> financial support as well. </p>

<p> We collected further information by means of </p>

<p> informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the </p>

<p> coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the </p>

<p> five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> discussed with us a number of their needs and </p>

<p> recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of </p>

<p> their discussions with us are presented below. </p>

<p> An increasing need for in-service training. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number </p>

<p> of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past </p>

<p> decade. However, they stressed that the original </p>

<p> training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although </p>

<p> mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, </p>

<p> these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, </p>

<p> they suggested that because training of new officers </p>

<p> already stretches available resources, the increasing </p>

<p> need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 </p>

<p> The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors indicated that most States now have State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they </p>

<p> reported that many are relatively new in these positions </p>

<p> or have received little formal information about how to </p>

<p> conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator </p>

<p> training should include the responsibilities and roles of </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can </p>

<p> effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools </p>

<p> in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that </p>

<p> plans are currently under way to establish procedures to </p>

<p> accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 </p>

<p> The need to improve lines of communication and </p>

<p> clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because of the lack of formal training and </p>

<p> the lack of communication among State coordinators, many </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs </p>

<p> by trial and error. They stated that although a certain </p>

<p> amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators (especially among coordinators in </p>

<p> neighboring States), increasing communication would </p>

<p> greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to </p>

<p> draw on the experiences of others instead of
&quot;reinventing </p>

<p> the wheel.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State </p>

<p> coordinators may need assistance with getting local </p>

<p> programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For </p>

<p> example, they stated that in the past, local programs </p>

<p> worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local </p>

<p> programs will need to be prompted to now work with the </p>

<p> STC instead. </p>

<p> The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 </p>

<p> At present, RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors reported that there is a well-developed system </p>

<p> for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the </p>

<p> classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors </p>

<p> periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by </p>

<p> observing classes taught by the officer. They also </p>

<p> indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate </p>

<p> officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to </p>

<p> correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure </p>

<p> that the problem has been corrected. However, to be </p>

<p> truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these </p>

<p> mentors should have the time and resources necessary to </p>

<p> work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their </p>

<p> performance. </p>

<p> The need for increased collaboration between </p>

<p> education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close </p>

<p> partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police </p>

<p> Department, the program is dependent on a strong and </p>

<p> continuing relationship between education and law </p>

<p> enforcement at every level. </p>

<p> At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see </p>

<p> close collaboration between the department of education </p>

<p> and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically </p>

<p> related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated </p>

<p> that the institutional commitment of State Departments of </p>

<p> Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help </p>

<p> resolve any community-level problems. Further, they </p>

<p> indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State </p>

<p> Departments of Education have an increasing role to play </p>

<p> in providing guidance concerning the various components </p>

<p> of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum </p>

<p> (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be </p>

<p> integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that ways in which State </p>

<p> Departments of Education could play a role in assisting </p>

<p> with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance </p>

<p> should be examined. </p>

<p> At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a </p>

<p> police department to teach the program. They reported </p>

<p> that the police department nominates a candidate for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be </p>

<p> acceptable to the school district administration. In the </p>

<p> classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is </p>

<p> evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's </p>

<p> performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 </p>

<p> The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand </p>

<p> its operations are considerable. They indicated that as </p>

<p> an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining </p>

<p> high standards at the community level. They reported </p>

<p> that as the role of the State coordinator continues to </p>

<p> become more important in this regard, the need for the </p>

<p> RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State </p>

<p> activities becomes even more crucial. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC </p>

<p> resources are already strained by current demands, </p>

<p> further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 </p>

<p> They indicated that even if support for such growth </p>

<p> exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will </p>

<p> develop that may weaken the &quot;grass-roots&quot; nature of
the </p>

<p> enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will </p>

<p> be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this </p>

<p> burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy </p>

<p> streamlined and responsive to the needs of the </p>

<p> communities that D.A.R.E. serves. </p>

<p> The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently </p>

<p> receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they </p>

<p> feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a </p>

<p> plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be </p>

<p> subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced </p>

<p> or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they </p>

<p> reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed </p>

<p> blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local </p>

<p> efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement </p>

<p> the program.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> In this chapter, we focused on the national- and </p>

<p> regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted </p>

<p> unstructured interviews with the executive director of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the </p>

<p> RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates </p>

<p> through memoranda of understanding between community law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, </p>

<p> monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, </p>

<p> serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In </p>

<p> addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> training. Organizations and individuals working to </p>

<p> promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State </p>

<p> levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that </p>

<p> provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Curriculum development and changes are the </p>

<p> responsibility of educational specialists from each of </p>

<p> the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention </p>

<p> specialists, assists in these endeavors. </p>

<p> Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated </p>

<p> the following key issues: a need for increased in- </p>

<p> service training and mentoring, providing training to </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and </p>

<p> collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding </p>

<p> sources. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 4 </p>

<p> STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In this chapter, we present the second component of </p>

<p> the implementation assessment, a survey of those </p>

<p> individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This </p>

<p> component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for </p>

<p> information concerning: </p>

<p> o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting </p>

<p> organizations, and </p>

<p> o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> The primary objective of this component was, of course, </p>

<p> to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level </p>

<p> operations. As a secondary objective, we collected </p>

<p> preliminary information to facilitate sample selection </p>

<p> for the school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. </p>

<p> This chapter covers both the methodology for and </p>

<p> findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 </p>

<p> The findings section presents data concerning the </p>

<p> administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and </p>

<p> problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in </p>

<p> NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a </p>

<p> review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and </p>

<p> operations, and an examination of prior studies of </p>

<p> school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 </p>

<p> Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have </p>

<p> considerable demands on their time, we designed the </p>

<p> instrument to be as brief and straightforward as </p>

<p> possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used </p>

<p> mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions </p>

<p> were included to encourage respondents to provide </p>

<p> detailed information. =20 </p>

<p> The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a </p>

<p> questionnaire and a list of school districts. The </p>

<p> questionnaire contained items concerning administration, </p>

<p> funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. The list of school districts contained those </p>

<p> districts we selected from that State for the first-phase </p>

<p> sample of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate whether each district on their </p>

<p> list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to </p>

<p> draw the second-phase sample for the school district </p>

<p> survey. </p>

<p> We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the </p>

<p> instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested </p>

<p> their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest </p>

<p> participants, as well the comments of the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol </p>

<p> and drug prevention program experts into the final draft </p>

<p> of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey </p>

<p> instrument and other data collection materials can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us </p>

<p> with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Based on this information, we identified </p>

<p> 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each </p>

<p> coordinator a package containing cover letters from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a </p>

<p> questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the </p>

<p> coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort </p>

<p> and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI </p>

<p> explained the study, provided assurances that all </p>

<p> information would be kept strictly confidential, and </p>

<p> requested copies of any pertinent State documents </p>

<p> concerning the organization and/or administration of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the </p>

<p> initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 </p>

<p> We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure </p>

<p> the return of completed materials or to collect the </p>

<p> information by phone. The RTCs were again of great </p>

<p> assistance to us in urging coordinators to return </p>

<p> surveys. </p>

<p> Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes </p>

<p> of verification, one question in the survey asked </p>

<p> respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. Although four States responded that they </p>

<p> did not have such a position, we determined after some </p>

<p> investigation that they did have a person who performs a </p>

<p> coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these </p>

<p> States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program was one of several roles they performed as </p>

<p> supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 </p>

<p> We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our </p>

<p> analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of </p>

<p> skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four </p>

<p> respondents did not complete survey items specifically </p>

<p> directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration </p>

<p> To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation </p>

<p> concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a </p>

<p> series of questions about the agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the </p>

<p> functions of each agency, and the relationships among </p>

<p> them. Findings from these questions are presented below. </p>

<p> Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to </p>

<p> report the agency with primary responsibility for </p>

<p> managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law </p>

<p> enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with </p>

<p> this responsibility. =20 </p>

<p> accommodates competing points of view, remains responsive </p>

<p> to the needs of its constituency, and continues as a </p>

<p> permanent component of State prevention activities (BJA, </p>

<p> 1988). We asked coordinators if the State had a policy </p>

<p> advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported </p>

<p> affirmatively. </p>

<p> To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 </p>

<p> coordinators with PABs to indicate the </p>

<p> agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards </p>

<p> and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit 4.2 shows that 65% or more of the States with </p>

<p> PABs listed State and local educational agencies, local </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies, and State D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> associations among their members. The leadership role of </p>

<p> the PABs was primarily held by law enforcement </p>

<p> representatives. The board was chaired by State law </p>

<p> Yet another agency encouraged to become involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is the State Department of Education. States </p>

<p> are encouraged to retain an educational consultant to act </p>

<p> as a liaison between the State Department of Education, </p>

<p> local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an </p>

<p> educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 </p>

<p> respondents reported having an educational advisor, and </p>

<p> two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired </p>

<p> about the employers of these consultants and found that </p>

<p> educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational </p>

<p> advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.3). </p>

<p> Functions. Next, we sought to examine the </p>

<p> responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the </p>

<p> functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- </p>

<p> quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the </p>

<p> State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were </p>

<p> formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and </p>

<p> advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> We also asked respondents to list functions </p>

<p> performed by the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs </p>

<p> that were not provided as close-ended response options.=20 </p>

<p> o recertifying officers (one State), </p>

<p> o selecting officers (one State), and </p>

<p> o serving as a clearinghouse for information </p>

<p> (one State). </p>

<p> Other duties performed by the PABs included long-term </p>

<p> planning (two States) and the selection and supervision </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinator (one State). </p>

<p> Communication. As mentioned earlier, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop </p>

<p> relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 </p>

<p> Having an educational consultant, however, does not </p>

<p> guarantee communication between the agencies. We, </p>

<p> therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well </p>

<p> they communicate with the Department of Education. Most </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a </p>

<p> great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the </p>

<p> State Department of Education. In six States, </p>

<p> coordinators reported little communication, and only one </p>

<p> reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having </p>

<p> a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> and the Department of Education. =20 </p>

<p> We also asked coordinators about the level of </p>

<p> communication between the PABs and the State Department </p>

<p> of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- </p>

<p> ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs </p>

<p> reported that their boards had a great deal of </p>

<p> communication, three reported some communication, three </p>

<p> reported little, and one reported none. =20 </p>

<p> Only one State reported that both the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication </p>

<p> with the Department of Education. </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested information on </p>

<p> funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to report the amount of funding received by </p>

<p> the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents </p>

<p> ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State </p>

<p> level. Four States reported that no funds were received </p>

<p> for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State </p>

<p> coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 </p>

<p> The mean amount of funds received by the primary </p>

<p> managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level </p>

<p> in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was </p>

<p> $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The </p>

<p> total amount received by the responding States was </p>

<p> $9,260,700. </p>

<p> Data Unavailable 5.1 </p>

<p> We asked the 33 respondents who reported the amount </p>

<p> of funding for State-level operations to identify the </p>

<p> sources of this funding (Exhibit 4.6). Four of the 33 </p>

<p> respondents did not answer this question. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received </p>

<p> from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all </p>

<p> funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, </p>

<p> four from State governors' grants, two from the State </p>

<p> Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and </p>

<p> one from other sources). Eight States reported that </p>

<p> funding was received from two sources, and eight States </p>

<p> reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we asked respondents to report other </p>

<p> sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended </p>

<p> response options. Responses included State and local </p>

<p> matching funds, special education trust funds, State </p>

<p> penalty assessment funds, funds from the Exhibit 4.6 Number

<p> coordinator survey, this information refers to </p>

<p> funding of State-level D.A.R.E. programs only. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has informed us that all </p>

<p> State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- </p>

<p> cation, August 9, 1994). </p>

<p> Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention </p>

<p> (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. </p>

<p> State Training Centers </p>

<p> As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has </p>

<p> been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 </p>

<p> Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a &quot;train the
trainer&quot; </p>

<p> model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct </p>

<p> their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification </p>

<p> procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether </p>

<p> their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) </p>

<p> reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a </p>

<p> training center reported that the State was in the </p>

<p> process of establishing a training center. </p>

<p> Implementation </p>

<p> To obtain a general idea of the level of </p>

<p> implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State </p>

<p> during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents </p>

<p> reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations </p>

<p> were used in at least one school in the State.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high </p>

<p> curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the </p>

<p> parent curriculum in at least one school. </p>

<p> Challenges and Problems </p>

<p> To acquire an understanding of the challenges and </p>

<p> problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- </p>

<p> tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended </p>

<p> questions about these issues. We categorized the </p>

<p> responses and counted the number of State coordinators </p>

<p> indicating each category. (We advise caution in using </p>

<p> these findings to make recommendations given the small </p>

<p> number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 </p>

<p> First, we asked respondents to identify the most </p>

<p> significant issues they face in working with the State's </p>

<p> Department of Education. The two most common responses </p>

<p> were improving communication between agencies (mentioned </p>

<p> by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational </p>

<p> advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other </p>

<p> responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted </p>

<p> the State Department of Education to undertake, such as </p>

<p> o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers (six States), </p>

<p> o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o understanding the role of law enforcement in </p>

<p> education (three States), </p>

<p> o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (two States), </p>

<p> o assisting in training programs (one State), and </p>

<p> o helping resolve problems between officers and </p>

<p> teachers (one State). </p>

<p> We then asked respondents to indicate the most </p>

<p> significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. It should be noted that most of these </p>

<p> issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug </p>

<p> prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, </p>

<p> evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, </p>

<p> were as follows:=20 </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding sources (8 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding specifically for training (6 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> Communication </p>

<p> o increasing communication between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, </p>

<p> regional, and national levels (10 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o improving relations with State </p>

<p> Department of Education (4 States) </p>

<p> o coping with the disorganization of the </p>

<p> program (4 States) </p>

<p> o improving public relations (3 States) </p>

<p> o keeping up with constantly shifting </p>

<p> policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board (2 States) </p>

<p> Evaluation </p>

<p> o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o evaluating the program (4 States) </p>

<p> Training </p>

<p> o improving training (3 States) </p>

<p> o handling problem officers (2 States) </p>

<p> o obtaining STC certification (1 State) </p>

<p> Staffing </p>

<p> o increasing staffing (6 States) </p>

<p> o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator position (2 States) </p>

<p> o forming a PAB (2 States) </p>

<p> Expansion </p>

<p> o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or </p>

<p> schools (7 States). </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on a survey of the </p>

<p> administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- </p>

<p> nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> responded to the survey. =20 </p>

<p> We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice </p>

<p> agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 </p>

<p> About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported high levels of communication </p>

<p> between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 </p>

<p> They also reported high levels of communication between </p>

<p> the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States </p>

<p> received at least $50,000 in funding for training and </p>

<p> administrative purposes, and most States had their own </p>

<p> STC. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 5 </p>

<p> SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION </p>

<p> COORDINATOR SURVEY </p>

<p> A survey of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators was the main component of our implementation </p>

<p> assessment. This component of the assessment was </p>

<p> conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about </p>

<p> the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ </p>

<p> specifically requested information on the following </p>

<p> questions: </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program at the local level? </p>

<p> o How involved in D.A.R.E. are </p>

<p> classroom teachers, churches, and </p>

<p> community groups? </p>

<p> o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other school-based alcohol and </p>

<p> other drug (AOD) prevention </p>

<p> programs implemented nationwide </p>

<p> in terms of geography, target </p>

<p> populations (such as ethnic </p>

<p> groups, economic strata, and </p>

<p> urbanicity), and grade levels? </p>

<p> o How do other AOD programs compare </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> them? </p>

<p> o What are local funding </p>

<p> arrangements for D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs? How do these </p>

<p> resources affect implementation? </p>

<p> A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had </p>

<p> three primary objectives: (a) to secure information </p>

<p> about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop </p>

<p> estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 </p>

<p> RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive </p>

<p> survey of school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and </p>

<p> questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as </p>

<p> respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police </p>

<p> officers, because we believed that drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators were the school district staff members best </p>

<p> able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug </p>

<p> prevention activities in the district, including both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. </p>

<p> This chapter presents the methodology and findings </p>

<p> for this survey. We should note that for this chapter </p>

<p> the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to </p>

<p> explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to </p>

<p> report what the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why </p>

<p> they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain </p>

<p> our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they </p>

<p> would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our </p>

<p> explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial </p>

<p> balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very </p>

<p> limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. </p>

<p> The findings section first presents information we </p>

<p> received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by </p>

<p> estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, </p>

<p> we also provide some general information about drug </p>

<p> policies in all the districts surveyed. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Sample Design </p>

<p> The sample design for the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased </p>

<p> stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample </p>

<p> design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this </p>

<p> survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to </p>

<p> produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic </p>

<p> status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and </p>

<p> urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to </p>

<p> enable comparisons between districts with and without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the </p>

<p> sample design is discussed below. </p>

<p> Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling </p>

<p> design was to obtain a list of public school districts </p>

<p> nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality </p>

<p> Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The </p>

<p> QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public </p>

<p> school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of </p>

<p> useful information for each school district. We used </p>

<p> this file as our sampling frame. Information that we </p>

<p> used from this file included the school district's </p>

<p> o SES (defined as the percentage of </p>

<p> children in the district below </p>

<p> poverty level), </p>

<p> o urbanicity (defined as urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural), </p>

<p> o ethnicity (defined as the </p>

<p> percentage of children in the </p>

<p> district who were black or </p>

<p> Hispanic), and </p>

<p> o district size (defined as the </p>

<p> number of students enrolled in </p>

<p> the district). =20 </p>

<p> For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, </p>

<p> we created five new variables that we later used for </p>

<p> stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created </p>

<p> a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, </p>

<p> to keep the total number of stratum cells within </p>

<p> reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the </p>

<p> urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one </p>

<p> category. We computed percentiles for minority status, </p>

<p> SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity </p>

<p> group. We then used the median of each variable to </p>

<p> define two categories (low/high) for each of the three </p>

<p> variables. The number and percentage of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented </p>

<p> in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. </p>

<p> First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase </p>

<p> of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a </p>

<p> nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each </p>

<p> region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority </p>

<p> status category, and district size category were </p>

<p> adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was a stratified random sample. =20 </p>

<p> The first step in selecting our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 </p>

<p> region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional </p>

<p> strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed </p>

<p> each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting </p>

<p> in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata </p>

<p> by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we </p>

<p> crossed each of those 40 strata by district size </p>

<p> (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is </p>

<p> presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. </p>

<p> The next step in our sampling design was to </p>

<p> determine how districts from each strata would be </p>

<p> selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We </p>

<p> assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 </p>

<p> In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes </p>

<p> across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every </p>

<p> stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling </p>

<p> frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would </p>

<p> have ensured good precision across strata. In the second </p>

<p> method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the </p>

<p> frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of </p>

<p> the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular </p>

<p> stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% </p>

<p> of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same </p>

<p> stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional </p>

<p> allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, </p>

<p> reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for </p>

<p> overall survey estimates. =20 </p>

<p> Because of its clear advantages, we chose </p>

<p> proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a </p>

<p> proportional number of school districts within each of </p>

<p> the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 </p>

<p> school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample </p>

<p> allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits </p>

<p> A.3 and A.4. </p>

<p> Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- </p>

<p> phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the </p>

<p> second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, </p>

<p> we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify </p>

<p> the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as </p>

<p> either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter </p>

<p> 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this </p>

<p> information or only partially completed the information, </p>

<p> we created a third category of school districts with an </p>

<p> unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported </p>

<p> that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% </p>

<p> did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the </p>

<p> districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the </p>

<p> responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> status of the first-phase sample by region. </p>

<p> The next step in selecting our second-phase sample </p>

<p> was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 </p>

<p> Calculations to determine the number of districts needed </p>

<p> in the second-phase sample were based first on the type </p>

<p> of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an </p>

<p> anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated </p>

<p> that 400 responding school districts were necessary to </p>

<p> achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we </p>

<p> selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. </p>

<p> Finally, we used the classifications provided by </p>

<p> the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 </p>

<p> Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase </p>

<p> sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. </p>

<p> Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were </p>

<p> computed using software developed at RTI specifically for </p>

<p> the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 </p>

<p> We computed analysis weights that took into account the </p>

<p> two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data </p>

<p> provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data </p>

<p> because the weighted data more accurately represents the </p>

<p> true population. The weights varied across strata based </p>

<p> on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size </p>

<p> of the school district. Analysis weights were computed </p>

<p> as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the </p>

<p> second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also </p>

<p> adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on </p>

<p> the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the </p>

<p> analysis weights coincides with the number of districts </p>

<p> in the frame. We also examined the variability of the </p>

<p> analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> RTI staff determined the contents of the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on </p>

<p> the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, </p>

<p> discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the </p>

<p> literature, and examination of the studies of drug </p>

<p> education programming previously conducted at RTI. We </p>

<p> used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize </p>

<p> ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were </p>

<p> included to encourage respondents to provide detailed </p>

<p> information. =20 </p>

<p> All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of </p>

<p> core items that were designed to provide background </p>

<p> information about the district and about the specific </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, </p>

<p> coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in </p>

<p> combination with other drug prevention curricula, </p>

<p> completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD </p>

<p> prevention programs, alone or in combination with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD </p>

<p> (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school </p>

<p> districts </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered </p>

<p> both sets of items. </p>

<p> After submitting the data collection instrument to </p>

<p> our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we </p>

<p> formally pretested all data collection materials and </p>

<p> procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators </p>

<p> assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, </p>

<p> two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode </p>

<p> Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest </p>

<p> questionnaire in early April 1992. </p>

<p> We used the responses of pretest participants, as </p>

<p> well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other </p>

<p> AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions </p>

<p> on the data collection procedures and instruments. A </p>

<p> copy of the survey instrument and other data collection </p>

<p> materials for this component of the study can be found in </p>

<p> Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, </p>

<p> questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 </p>

<p> selected school districts. The cover letter included a </p>

<p> brief statement of study objectives, information on how </p>

<p> the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent </p>

<p> postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The </p>

<p> postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, </p>

<p> reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, </p>

<p> and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance </p>

<p> was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate </p>

<p> mailouts. </p>

<p> Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each </p>

<p> of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to </p>

<p> ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct </p>

<p> addresses for three of the four returned packages and </p>

<p> remailed the material. The remaining school district had </p>

<p> recently merged with another school district. Because </p>

<p> this merged district was already included in the sample, </p>

<p> the duplicate was dropped. </p>

<p> We began making follow-up telephone calls to </p>

<p> nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder </p>

<p> postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made </p>

<p> by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and </p>

<p> July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to </p>

<p> complete and return their instruments as soon as </p>

<p> possible. Those coordinators who indicated to </p>

<p> interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the </p>

<p> instrument were asked to complete the survey over the </p>

<p> telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same </p>

<p> for both telephone and mail administration. The final </p>

<p> response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our </p>

<p> expected response rate of 80%. The final sample </p>

<p> disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.1 Final Sample Disposition </p>

<p> N % </p>

<p> Refused 8 1.6 </p>

<p> No response 63 12.6 </p>

<p> Duplicate 1 0.2 </p>

<p> As indicated, we completed almost twice as many </p>

<p> interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to </p>

<p> several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have </p>

<p> higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the </p>

<p> questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school </p>

<p> year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- </p>

<p> year obligations that limited the amount of time they </p>

<p> could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the </p>

<p> instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having </p>

<p> the interviewers read these questions to the respondents </p>

<p> may have made answering them less burdensome. Because </p>

<p> the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive </p>

<p> in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods </p>

<p> of administration are comparable. </p>

<p> Returned questionnaires were delivered to a </p>

<p> check-in station where they were logged in, coded, </p>

<p> manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented </p>

<p> machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip </p>

<p> patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a </p>

<p> few school district drug prevention coordinators to </p>

<p> resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or </p>

<p> contradictory information. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The first objective of this survey was to obtain </p>

<p> information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the </p>

<p> local level. This section presents findings concerning </p>

<p> the implementation, administration, participation of </p>

<p> teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data </p>

<p> from survey items asked only of the districts with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school </p>

<p> districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts </p>

<p> surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, </p>

<p> 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% </p>

<p> used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the </p>

<p> parent curriculum. =20 </p>

<p> Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the </p>

<p> great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, </p>

<p> around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior </p>

<p> high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We </p>

<p> further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in </p>

<p> which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 </p>

<p> displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of </p>

<p> the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade </p>

<p> classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts </p>

<p> implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which </p>

<p> probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating </p>

<p> elementary from junior high or middle schools in that </p>

<p> district. </p>

<p> Administration. One objective of NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually </p>

<p> manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various </p>

<p> aspects of the program at the local level. To address </p>

<p> these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all </p>

<p> agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two </p>

<p> agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies </p>

<p> administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of </p>

<p> the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the </p>

<p> county sheriff's department alone administered the </p>

<p> program, and about 34% reported city/town police </p>

<p> departments administered it.=20 </p>

<p> We next asked coordinators to report whether law </p>

<p> enforcement or education was responsible for various </p>

<p> activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently </p>

<p> reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible </p>

<p> for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom </p>

<p> activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that </p>

<p> responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning </p>

<p> extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation also requested an examination of the extent </p>

<p> of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported that classroom teachers were </p>

<p> actively involved in the program. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators about classroom teachers' level of </p>

<p> participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% </p>

<p> reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some </p>

<p> participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% </p>

<p> reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 </p>

<p> To determine the extent to which teachers reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons, we asked coordinators about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.-related activities performed by classroom </p>

<p> teachers. Most of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the </p>

<p> classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported </p>

<p> that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message </p>

<p> into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework. </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine </p>

<p> the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., </p>

<p> church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking </p>

<p> school-based interventions with the larger community </p>

<p> strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; </p>

<p> Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the </p>

<p> prevention coordinators to specify members of the </p>

<p> community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About </p>

<p> 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively </p>

<p> involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so </p>

<p> involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, </p>

<p> and 5% said that church groups were so involved. </p>

<p> Integration and Coordination. Another objective </p>

<p> of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> integration and coordination with other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate the level at which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About </p>

<p> 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was </p>

<p> very well integrated, 31% reported it was well </p>

<p> integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some </p>

<p> types of school districts than in others, we examined the </p>

<p> differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority </p>

<p> status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No </p>

<p> statistically significant differences were found.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD </p>

<p> programs across different types of school districts. </p>

<p> One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> responsibilities of law enforcement with those of </p>

<p> education agencies are written agreements that solidify </p>

<p> commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound </p>

<p> working relationships. We asked coordinators about the </p>

<p> existence of such agreements and found that approximately </p>

<p> 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had </p>

<p> a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with </p>

<p> written agreements about the contents of these </p>

<p> agreements. The following components of the agreements </p>

<p> were mentioned by the accompanying number of </p>

<p> coordinators: </p>

<p> o the responsibilities of all parties (23 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o time (21 coordinators); </p>

<p> o funding/fees (20 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling (15 coordinators); </p>

<p> o curricula (10 coordinators); </p>

<p> o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o grades used in (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o length of program (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o school policies (4 coordinators); </p>

<p> o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); </p>

<p> o materials (3 coordinators);=20 </p>

<p> o graduation program (3 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o &quot;don't know&quot; (4 coordinators). </p>

<p> Problems. We asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators to provide information concerning problems </p>

<p> with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to </p>

<p> suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be </p>

<p> improved.=20 </p>

<p> We asked coordinators to indicate whether there </p>

<p> were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to </p>

<p> specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district </p>

<p> drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any </p>

<p> barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding </p>

<p> as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few </p>

<p> officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties </p>

<p> (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers </p>

<p> were in areas over which the school system has little </p>

<p> control (funding and number of officers). </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to </p>

<p> Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools </p>

<p> Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> (N=3D222). </p>

<p> Next, in an open-ended question, we asked </p>

<p> coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the </p>

<p> coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with </p>

<p> problems were </p>

<p> o lack of time (19 coordinators); </p>

<p> o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o difficulties getting program started (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o lack of coordination between school and </p>

<p> police (3 coordinators). </p>

<p> Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, </p>

<p> changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective </p>

<p> in their district, and then to elaborate on these </p>

<p> changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that there was at least one change that they thought </p>

<p> would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following </p>

<p> responses were the changes they mentioned: </p>

<p> o expand to other grade levels (26 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase parental participation (7 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase funding (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase community involvement (6 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase teacher training and involvement (5 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o improve quality/dependability officers (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase integration with other curricula (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); =20 </p>

<p> o increase publicity (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o change curricula (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o teach officers to be teachers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase refresher training for officers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o include D.A.R.E. as part of student </p>

<p> assistance program (1 coordinator); </p>

<p> o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in </p>

<p> rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). </p>

<p> Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to </p>

<p> expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% </p>

<p> planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to </p>

<p> decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% </p>

<p> planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were </p>

<p> undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Further, to determine whether any particular type </p>

<p> of school district was more likely to expand use of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences </p>

<p> in the percentages of districts planning to increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or </p>

<p> urbanicity. No statistically significant differences </p>

<p> were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were </p>

<p> fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD </p>

<p> Programs </p>

<p> The second objective of this survey was to develop </p>

<p> national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate all published drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula used by the school district in the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and </p>

<p> discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula </p>

<p> that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended </p>

<p> responses concerning other published curricula. We </p>

<p> used this information in combination with the sample </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small school districts to </p>

<p> use D.A.R.E. (p&lt;.01). =20 </p>

<p> Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels </p>

<p> targeted by each of the three most frequently used </p>

<p> curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> curricula were used in the school district at each grade </p>

<p> level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of </p>

<p> the school districts with Quest targeted the program to </p>

<p> the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 12% to the senior high school </p>

<p> level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY </p>

<p> targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% </p>

<p> to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all </p>

<p> three curricula were more likely to target elementary or </p>

<p> middle/junior high school levels. </p>

<p> Substances Targeted. To determine whether the </p>

<p> three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in </p>

<p> substances targeted by the program, we asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We </p>

<p> found no significant differences in substances targeted </p>

<p> among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three </p>

<p> of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all </p>

<p> substances.=20 </p>

<p> expected, almost all school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that police officers were </p>

<p> responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for </p>

<p> teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- </p>

<p> fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom </p>

<p> teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs </p>

<p> The final objective of this study was to make </p>

<p> comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a </p>

<p> variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this </p>

<p> section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the </p>

<p> curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to </p>

<p> curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD </p>

<p> curricula in general because it would have been too </p>

<p> burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of </p>

<p> the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- </p>

<p> 1992 school year. =20 </p>

<p> We first asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs only. We asked all coordinators using other </p>

<p> (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer an identical set of items concerning their </p>

<p> other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of </p>

<p> items. Information gathered from these matched sets of </p>

<p> questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other </p>

<p> AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used </p>

<p> both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. </p>

<p> Funding. The first comparisons we examined were </p>

<p> comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate </p>

<p> all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD </p>

<p> programs were DFSCA education funds and school district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to receive funding from city/county funds, </p>

<p> corporate donations, and individual donations. </p>

<p> Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared </p>

<p> satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked </p>

<p> the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate </p>

<p> five program components as very satisfactory, </p>

<p> satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The </p>

<p> five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative </p>

<p> requirements, student receptivity, and effects on </p>

<p> students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated </p>

<p> any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD </p>

<p> programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or </p>

<p> effects on students as very unsatisfactory. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to be viewed by the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of </p>

<p> the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components </p>

<p> as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the </p>

<p> components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity </p>

<p> was the component with the highest percentage of </p>

<p> coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 </p>

<p> To determine whether school districts with </p>

<p> particular characteristics were more likely to rate </p>

<p> program components as very satisfactory than other </p>

<p> districts, we examined ratings of each of the components </p>

<p> by these characteristics. Among coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts </p>

<p> were significantly more likely than those in low- </p>

<p> percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity </p>

<p> as very satisfactory (p&lt;.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban </p>

<p> districts were significantly more likely (p&lt;.05) than </p>

<p> those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and </p>

<p> effects on students as very satisfactory (Exhibit 5.11).=20 </p>

<p> There were no significant differences in components rated </p>

<p> as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in low and </p>

<p> high SES districts or between other AOD programs in low </p>

<p> and high SES districts. Furthermore, there were no </p>

<p> significant differences in components rated as very </p>

<p> satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in small and large </p>

<p> districts or between other AOD programs in small and </p>

<p> large districts. </p>

<p> Support for Curricula. We also asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate how </p>

<p> supportive they perceived the community, school </p>

<p> personnel, students, parents, law enforcement, and civic </p>

<p> groups to be of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Response options for these questions were very </p>

<p> supportive, somewhat supportive, and not supportive.=20 </p>

<p> None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. perceived students </p>

<p> or law enforcement as unsupportive of the program (data </p>

<p> not shown). The percentages of coordinators who </p>

<p> perceived any of the listed individuals or agencies as </p>

<p> unsupportive were very small for both D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to </p>

<p> strictly adhere to the curricula and established </p>

<p> procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt </p>

<p> the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, </p>

<p> little is known about how prevention curricula are </p>

<p> actually adapted. We asked the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD </p>

<p> programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang </p>

<p> activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition of the district, student or community </p>

<p> poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% </p>

<p> of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about </p>

<p> 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported </p>

<p> adapting for one of these reasons. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the </p>

<p> above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> o omitting lessons. </p>

<p> General Drug Policies </p>

<p> In this final section of Chapter 5, we present </p>

<p> information from responses to questions that were </p>

<p> designed to examine general drug policies in the school </p>

<p> districts. All coordinators responded to these questions </p>

<p> regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula. =20 </p>

<p> Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the </p>

<p> school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found </p>

<p> that 96% did have such a policy. </p>

<p> Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug </p>

<p> prevention program that many schools have adopted is the </p>

<p> student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee </p>

<p> assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct </p>

<p> such activities as screening for alcohol and drug </p>

<p> involvement, making referrals, and developing and </p>

<p> coordinating early intervention plans for youth with </p>

<p> problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 </p>

<p> Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in </p>

<p> place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 </p>

<p> districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the </p>

<p> elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high </p>

<p> school level. </p>

<p> We asked the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of </p>

<p> individuals were trained to participate in these programs </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned </p>

<p> that principals and guidance counselors had been trained </p>

<p> to participate in SAPs. </p>

<p> We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to </p>

<p> indicate the types of individuals who actually </p>

<p> implemented the programs and how effective they were </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and </p>

<p> students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived </p>

<p> guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and </p>

<p> district/school nurses as the most effective at </p>

<p> implementing these programs. Coordinators most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned that community professionals and </p>

<p> community volunteers were not effective.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on the results of our </p>

<p> nationally representative, random sample of 500 school </p>

<p> districts. A total of 429 school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data </p>

<p> presented in this chapter were weighted to take into </p>

<p> account the complex sample design. </p>

<p> Over half of the school districts in the United </p>

<p> States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase </p>

<p> over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the </p>

<p> program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these </p>

<p> without the program plan to begin use. The two other </p>

<p> most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of </p>

<p> the districts. </p>

<p> Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% </p>

<p> used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from </p>

<p> law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving </p>

<p> funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs </p>

<p> to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, </p>

<p> teaching, administrative requirements, student </p>

<p> receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, </p>

<p> coordinators were more likely to indicate that the </p>

<p> community, school personnel, students, parents, law </p>

<p> enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of </p>

<p> the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting </p>

<p> the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons </p>

<p> for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at </p>

<p> the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., </p>

<p> sheriff's department or city/town police department). In </p>

<p> most districts, coordinators reported that officer </p>

<p> selection and classroom activities were the </p>

<p> responsibility of the police, while school and classroom </p>

<p> selection were the responsibility of education. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 6 </p>

<p> SITE VISITS </p>

<p> The final component of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 </p>

<p> We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the </p>

<p> organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- </p>

<p> based drug prevention programs. The site visits also </p>

<p> gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, </p>

<p> teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program in action.=20 </p>

<p> For the site visits, we selected four schools in </p>

<p> three school districts. Two of the school districts were </p>

<p> adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city </p>

<p> environment, with a large minority population and a </p>

<p> substantial drug problem. The third school district was </p>

<p> located in a rural area in the South; it also had a </p>

<p> substantial minority population but less of a drug </p>

<p> problem. The school in one urban school district had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did </p>

<p> not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and one did not. </p>

<p> Because the school districts and schools were </p>

<p> limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, </p>

<p> selected, the information gathered from these sites is </p>

<p> not representative of schools in general. We present </p>

<p> data gathered from this component of the assessment to </p>

<p> illustrate and complement findings from other components </p>

<p> of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need </p>

<p> to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings </p>

<p> and encourage readers to use similar discretion. </p>

<p> For the site visit interviews and observations, we </p>

<p> developed site visit protocols that were based on issues </p>

<p> raised in the previous components of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit </p>

<p> general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We </p>

<p> used protocols instead of structured surveys because we </p>

<p> believed the structured format would inhibit the </p>

<p> exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 </p>

<p> Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a </p>

<p> wealth of information that a structured format might have </p>

<p> prevented. We often departed from the protocols to </p>

<p> follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential </p>

<p> interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in </p>

<p> some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. =20 </p>

<p> Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team </p>

<p> included at least one senior investigator with </p>

<p> considerable experience in conducting site visits. A </p>

<p> two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban </p>

<p> schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site </p>

<p> visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors </p>

<p> jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer </p>

<p> took notes to reduce the chances of missing key </p>

<p> information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four </p>

<p> individuals at the same time. </p>

<p> Each team conducted interviews with a variety of </p>

<p> individuals, including </p>

<p> o the coordinator responsible for the </p>

<p> development and implementation of drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the school </p>

<p> district; </p>

<p> o individuals teaching drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula to students (including </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers at schools with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.), </p>

<p> o their supervisors (if any), and </p>

<p> o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). </p>

<p> When available, we also interviewed others involved in </p>

<p> drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral </p>

<p> (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug </p>

<p> action groups). =20 </p>

<p> In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit </p>

<p> team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's </p>

<p> activities in the school outside the classroom. We also </p>

<p> observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom </p>

<p> observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted </p>

<p> in special education classes. The selection of classes </p>

<p> to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching </p>

<p> drug prevention the day of our site visit and the </p>

<p> discretion of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator. </p>

<p> This chapter contains two sections. In the first, </p>

<p> we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban </p>

<p> schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention </p>

<p> programming in the rural schools. Within each section, </p>

<p> we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, </p>

<p> followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. </p>

<p> Urban Schools </p>

<p> Urban School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after </p>

<p> being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school </p>

<p> received D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed three individuals involved in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in </p>

<p> charge of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (an officer with many </p>

<p> years of experience who had </p>

<p> administered D.A.R.E. for </p>

<p> 5 years); </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for 5 years and </p>

<p> currently teaching 16 classes a </p>

<p> week); =20 </p>

<p> o the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator.=20 </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. =20 </p>

<p> Administration. According to the police </p>

<p> administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows </p>

<p> the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that </p>

<p> the local police, State police, and Board of Education </p>

<p> work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He </p>

<p> further indicated that this coordination has ensured the </p>

<p> integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> consistency with drug education required by the State, </p>

<p> and smooth integration with other drug education </p>

<p> initiatives. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. Initial steps in the </p>

<p> implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by </p>

<p> the police administrator, are as follows. The local </p>

<p> police department conducts initial screening of candidate </p>

<p> officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are interviewed by the local police department, </p>

<p> and then by the State police. Successfully screened </p>

<p> candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered </p>

<p> by the State police. After completing the training, </p>

<p> officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of </p>

<p> schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned </p>

<p> a general target area and allowed to select the schools </p>

<p> in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated </p>

<p> that he and other officers are provided with a list of </p>

<p> schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their </p>

<p> selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of </p>

<p> the schools he selects can be private. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, a limited </p>

<p> attempt is made to match officer and student </p>

<p> characteristics. For example, he stated that in the </p>

<p> Hispanic community, the local police department attempts </p>

<p> to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 </p>

<p> Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching </p>

<p> occurs. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program is monitored by both the State and local police </p>

<p> departments. He reported that a staff member from the </p>

<p> State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the </p>

<p> year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' </p>

<p> receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit </p>

<p> feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also </p>

<p> stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of </p>

<p> his supervisory responsibilities. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, school </p>

<p> personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in </p>

<p> part because the program is free to the school. The </p>

<p> schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention </p>

<p> resources for additional drug prevention purposes. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that some </p>

<p> teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of </p>

<p> personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer reported that although State policy requires </p>

<p> teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, </p>

<p> they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers </p>

<p> do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have </p>

<p> been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to </p>

<p> allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that </p>

<p> no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of </p>

<p> acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about </p>

<p> problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> the police administrator reported that although there are </p>

<p> some individuals who do not get along, it is not a </p>

<p> system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that </p>

<p> although principals are supportive of the program, he has </p>

<p> yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school </p>

<p> staff participate in the program. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that parental </p>

<p> involvement generally has taken the form of assistance </p>

<p> from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation </p>

<p> ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of </p>

<p> parental involvement varies substantially from one school </p>

<p> to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his </p>

<p> experience parents generally do not show an active </p>

<p> interest in D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, the </p>

<p> investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is </p>

<p> limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> have little time to seek community involvement: &quot;The </p>

<p> reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day </p>

<p> teaching classes; there isn't time to do anything
else.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups </p>

<p> have little participation in the program. </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the </p>

<p> funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA </p>

<p> through a grant to the State police). He reported that </p>

<p> support received from the State police is currently </p>

<p> limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers </p>

<p> and supervisors are paid by the local police department, </p>

<p> and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, there is real </p>

<p> danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts </p>

<p> because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that </p>

<p> implementation has already been severely restricted </p>

<p> because of lack of resources. </p>

<p> Curriculum. We asked the police administrator </p>

<p> whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the </p>

<p> special needs of his area. He responded, &quot;We teach </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a </p>

<p> program that is administered throughout the country, then </p>

<p> you do not tailor it.&quot; When asked about addressing the </p>

<p> needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences and </p>

<p> information they received from the police academy into </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs </p>

<p> and their behaviors are discussed. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> advocates believe that classroom activity should be </p>

<p> supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not </p>

<p> express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 </p>

<p> The reasons he gave were that the program is still </p>

<p> experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of </p>

<p> officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and </p>

<p> the cost of the parent program would dramatically </p>

<p> increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent </p>

<p> curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers </p>

<p> would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator </p>

<p> stated that &quot;If more money was available, this (parent </p>

<p> curriculum) would certainly be an option the local </p>

<p> department would look into.&quot; </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The police </p>

<p> administrator stated, &quot;One of our major problems is that
</p>

<p> we have so few officers and so many schools.&quot; He </p>

<p> indicated that the department tries to &quot;keep D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> moving through the schools&quot; and to cover as many
students </p>

<p> as possible. The administrator reported that although </p>

<p> this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools </p>

<p> reached within the department's limited resources, it </p>

<p> also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the </p>

<p> school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is </p>

<p> discontinued and moved to another school). The </p>

<p> administrator reported that many school officials are </p>

<p> angry about this policy. </p>

<p> The police administrator also indicated the need </p>

<p> for more evaluation. He stated, &quot;Evaluation is the only </p>

<p> way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't </p>

<p> think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the </p>

<p> drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first </p>

<p> step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It </p>

<p> has taken too long for evaluations to come about.&quot; He </p>

<p> said that he would at least like to have information on </p>

<p> how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and </p>

<p> inner-city areas. He asked, &quot;If we find the program is </p>

<p> working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we </p>

<p> do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify </p>

<p> it to meet those needs?&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems </p>

<p> areas. First, he indicated that although one of his </p>

<p> schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was </p>

<p> designed for the officer to stay in contact with the </p>

<p> school and that in his current situation, he is in and </p>

<p> out of the school with little chance for further contact </p>

<p> with the students. Finally, he reported the need for </p>

<p> greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 </p>

<p> &quot;Something should be done to get the parents and </p>

<p> principals more involved so that students feel they have </p>

<p> really accomplished something that has meaning.&quot; </p>

<p> The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 </p>

<p> African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the </p>

<p> students spoke limited English and needed translations of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police </p>

<p> officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation </p>

<p> uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a </p>

<p> friend. The officer's teaching style was very </p>

<p> straightforward and &quot;streetwise,&quot; and he was both
gruff </p>

<p> and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the </p>

<p> material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The </p>

<p> interaction between officer and students was an easy, </p>

<p> bantering one. </p>

<p> The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on </p>

<p> the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade </p>

<p> consumers and children to purchase and use different </p>

<p> products. The lesson began with a short introductory </p>

<p> lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of </p>

<p> the media. The officer then asked students questions </p>

<p> about different products to show them how much they have </p>

<p> learned from the media. The officer gave examples of </p>

<p> different types of advertisements (e.g., &quot;personal </p>

<p> testimony,&quot; &quot;bandwagon&quot;) and also used ads
from magazines </p>

<p> to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 </p>

<p> minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 </p>

<p> During the class, the students were rowdy but </p>

<p> attentive. They called out answers to the officer's </p>

<p> questions and felt free to make comments. The students </p>

<p> treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest </p>

<p> and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 </p>

<p> The classroom teacher was present during the </p>

<p> lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's </p>

<p> office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading </p>

<p> papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the </p>

<p> lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input </p>

<p> occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson </p>

<p> got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was </p>

<p> to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only </p>

<p> reprimanded talkers. </p>

<p> Once the lesson was completed, the officer left </p>

<p> immediately. There was no evidence of any outside </p>

<p> contact with students. =20 </p>

<p> Urban School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school </p>

<p> district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug </p>

<p> prevention lesson that we observed. The following </p>

<p> summarizes the discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> reported that there is no specific drug prevention </p>

<p> program in place. She indicated that drug prevention </p>

<p> textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from </p>

<p> outside the school make presentations at drug prevention </p>

<p> assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher </p>

<p> might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading </p>

<p> class or show a video. She stated, &quot;We put together lots
</p>

<p> of little things that add up to something you might call </p>

<p> a program, but we don't have a structured program.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. The coordinator indicated that </p>

<p> each student at the school receives drug education </p>

<p> information at least on a monthly basis. However, she </p>

<p> reported that lower grades receive less and in a more </p>

<p> loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he </p>

<p> makes sure his students receive some drug prevention </p>

<p> education every week. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside </p>

<p> for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 </p>

<p> The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug </p>

<p> prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that teachers' support </p>

<p> for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher </p>

<p> you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers </p>

<p> think that drug prevention education is important, but </p>

<p> that some are far more committed than others to </p>

<p> incorporating drug prevention lessons into their </p>

<p> curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of </p>

<p> his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to </p>

<p> talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He </p>

<p> stated, &quot;Some either don't know what to say or just
don't </p>

<p> care enough.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that law enforcement </p>

<p> personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention activities and have attended local school </p>

<p> council meetings and conducted in-service training with </p>

<p> teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years </p>

<p> ago law enforcement officials came into the school to </p>

<p> work with students targeted as high risk. She stated </p>

<p> that &quot;the success of that program depended upon whether </p>

<p> or not the student accepted the officer.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> When we asked the coordinator about the involvement </p>

<p> of individuals from the community in the school's drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the </p>

<p> community has been involved in implementing the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the </p>

<p> community has no idea about what the school is doing in </p>

<p> terms of drug prevention education. She stated, &quot;I don't
</p>

<p> think the community feels that it is their place to be </p>

<p> involved.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention </p>

<p> activities until the school began receiving money </p>

<p> specifically designated for drug prevention education </p>

<p> (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the </p>

<p> school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA </p>

<p> funds and that the amount of funding had steadily </p>

<p> increased over those years. She noted, however, that </p>

<p> this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and </p>

<p> it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 </p>

<p> According to the coordinator, the lack of resources </p>

<p> prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> indicated that although all drugs are covered by their </p>

<p> drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The </p>

<p> coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that </p>

<p> alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and </p>

<p> adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he </p>

<p> spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he </p>

<p> spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and </p>

<p> resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about </p>

<p> drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to </p>

<p> spend too much time educating students about the types of </p>

<p> drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of </p>

<p> self-esteem has first been created. </p>

<p> When we asked whether the school drug prevention </p>

<p> program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic </p>

<p> minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes </p>

<p> about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are </p>

<p> reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, </p>

<p> many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she </p>

<p> felt that white suburbs would have to work more with </p>

<p> adapting materials to fit their population. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the </p>

<p> cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an </p>

<p> individual basis with students and their parents. The </p>

<p> teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of </p>

<p> teaching drug prevention when many of the students live </p>

<p> in homes where the norm is to &quot;drink heavily and abuse </p>

<p> family members.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator said that in the future she would like to </p>

<p> purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She </p>

<p> indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> but would like information about how to get the program.=20 </p>

<p> One negative factor she reported having heard about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the </p>

<p> program. She stated, &quot;When you first called and asked if
</p>

<p> we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone </p>

<p> was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other </p>

<p> schools, it is good.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that </p>

<p> she would like to increase the amount and consistency of </p>

<p> delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to </p>

<p> bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the </p>

<p> classroom teacher both reported that they want to have </p>

<p> the drug prevention program administered by one person </p>

<p> who would come in and take responsibility for the </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a special </p>

<p> education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class </p>

<p> comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 </p>

<p> Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 </p>

<p> The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed </p>

<p> in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew </p>

<p> on their strengths. He often called on students who </p>

<p> would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them </p>

<p> formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly </p>

<p> correct, he encouraged the student to think further about </p>

<p> the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately </p>

<p> answered students' questions. </p>

<p> The topic of the observed lesson concerned the </p>

<p> functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson </p>

<p> designed to provide students with background information </p>

<p> about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the </p>

<p> body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed </p>

<p> the textbook closely. Because the students were slow </p>

<p> learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the </p>

<p> students to read sections aloud and then immediately </p>

<p> asking questions about the section just covered. Most </p>

<p> students appeared interested in the lesson. They </p>

<p> followed along in the textbook and answered questions </p>

<p> with sincerity. A few students consistently put their </p>

<p> hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There </p>

<p> were no discipline problems during the class. After </p>

<p> class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group </p>

<p> discussions. He reported that this group of students was </p>

<p> too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 </p>

<p> Rural Schools </p>

<p> Rural School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed </p>

<p> four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, </p>

<p> including: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in charge of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer, </p>

<p> o the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, </p>

<p> o the school guidance counselor, and </p>

<p> o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer taught. </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. </p>

<p> Administration. The police administrator indicated </p>

<p> that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city </p>

<p> police department. He reported that this was the first </p>

<p> semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this </p>

<p> particular school. He stated that the agreement between </p>

<p> the school and police department is informal. </p>

<p> Implementation. The police administrator reported </p>

<p> that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the </p>

<p> local police department, approval of the officer by the </p>

<p> State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> training course. </p>

<p> The officer reported that there are no problems </p>

<p> coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there </p>

<p> is &quot;eagerness from all sides to make the program
work.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> According to the officer, some classroom teachers </p>

<p> participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further </p>

<p> indicated that much of the time students are just as </p>

<p> receptive without the teacher present. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are </p>

<p> becoming more involved in the program. He stated that </p>

<p> they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, </p>

<p> such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his </p>

<p> relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to </p>

<p> receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as </p>

<p> soon as possible. </p>

<p> According to the officer and the police </p>

<p> administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 </p>

<p> They attributed this to the program being new and hoped </p>

<p> that there would be more community involvement in the </p>

<p> coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. is well received by the &quot;educated&quot; </p>

<p> community. He indicated that churches in the community </p>

<p> have not been particularly receptive and simply do not </p>

<p> want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance </p>

<p> counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a </p>

<p> loss to the program. </p>

<p> According to the school counselor, students' </p>

<p> attitudes toward police had changed considerably since </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that &quot;students </p>

<p> now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to </p>

<p> avoid.&quot; </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer, while the school pays any costs for the </p>

<p> curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district </p>

<p> coordinator indicated that the school did not have the </p>

<p> funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related </p>

<p> paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is </p>

<p> seeking a State grant for additional supplies. </p>

<p> Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. classes are a &quot;wonderful way of teaching </p>

<p> students to say no&quot; and that the self-esteem modules are
</p>

<p> particularly valuable and effective. According to the </p>

<p> district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their </p>

<p> other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately </p>

<p> there was little coordination between different </p>

<p> curricula.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not </p>

<p> target the curriculum to any particular substances and </p>

<p> does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 </p>

<p> He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do </p>

<p> most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this </p>

<p> community there is little gang activity. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor </p>

<p> indicated that she would like the school to provide </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The </p>

<p> guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated </p>

<p> the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other </p>

<p> drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 </p>

<p> According to the counselor, &quot;Trying to teach drug </p>

<p> prevention education in high school is futile.&quot; </p>

<p> The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 </p>

<p> She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds </p>

<p> still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students </p>

<p> usually have poor attendance records, are poorly </p>

<p> motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated </p>

<p> that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are </p>

<p> not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 </p>

<p> The district coordinator indicated that one problem </p>

<p> has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty </p>

<p> students were African American, and two students were </p>

<p> Caucasian. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his </p>

<p> thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The </p>

<p> officer presented himself as a &quot;big brother,&quot;
someone </p>

<p> whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance </p>

<p> or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. </p>

<p> The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could </p>

<p> be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used </p>

<p> examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer </p>

<p> encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. question box.&quot; In the previous week,
students </p>

<p> had been asked to write questions for the officer and </p>

<p> place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a </p>

<p> question from the box and answered that question. For </p>

<p> the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the </p>

<p> students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher </p>

<p> in supervising the games. </p>

<p> During the class, students were interested and </p>

<p> inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer </p>

<p> questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher remained present during most of the </p>

<p> lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading </p>

<p> papers. =20 </p>

<p> The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in </p>

<p> the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to </p>

<p> students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students </p>

<p> seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a </p>

<p> student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not </p>

<p> present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This </p>

<p> was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that </p>

<p> the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 </p>

<p> Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- </p>

<p> part of the school staff. </p>

<p> Rural School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, including the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), </p>

<p> the supervisor of health services, and two members of a </p>

<p> local advisory board for substance abuse. The following </p>

<p> summarizes discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. Coordination of the drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school </p>

<p> and other such schools in the community rests with the </p>

<p> school district drug prevention coordinator. He </p>

<p> indicated that there are a variety of programs currently </p>

<p> available to schools but that implementation and </p>

<p> coordination are sporadic. </p>

<p> Implementation. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> parents in this school are becoming more aware of the </p>

<p> drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to </p>

<p> get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing </p>

<p> that they cannot &quot;send their kids to school to get </p>

<p> fixed,&quot; and so are starting to take responsibility for </p>

<p> their children's problems. He also indicated that school </p>

<p> personnel are becoming more involved.=20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the district coordinator, </p>

<p> the school receives most of its drug prevention funds </p>

<p> from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the </p>

<p> school board and a local university, as well as the </p>

<p> Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, </p>

<p> could only be spent on programs delivered to Native </p>

<p> American children. </p>

<p> Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a </p>

<p> variety of curricula are available to teachers at this </p>

<p> school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and </p>

<p> some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 </p>

<p> is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 </p>

<p> However, he indicated that only about half the teachers </p>

<p> had been trained to teach this program. </p>

<p> The advisory board members informed us of a </p>

<p> community drug abuse treatment program currently in use </p>

<p> in this and other area schools that follows the
&quot;12-step&quot; </p>

<p> model. This program offers intervention, education, and </p>

<p> prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance </p>

<p> use, as well as to their families. One board member </p>

<p> stated that suspended youth must attend this program </p>

<p> before returning to school. </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now </p>

<p> being implemented in this school. </p>

<p> The health supervisor reported that the school also </p>

<p> sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the </p>

<p> National Federation of Parents that invites youth and </p>

<p> community members to pledge their support for drug-free </p>

<p> lives by displaying red ribbons. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. All individuals </p>

<p> interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination </p>

<p> between the different types of drug prevention programs, </p>

<p> as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The </p>

<p> coordinator reported that he would like to have someone </p>

<p> responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs </p>

<p> in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He </p>

<p> said that &quot;a lot of people are working very hard, but </p>

<p> have little idea of whether or not their efforts are </p>

<p> successful.&quot; </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that time is also a major </p>

<p> problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He </p>

<p> stated that preparing students for end of the year </p>

<p> testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and </p>

<p> allows them little time to teach drug prevention. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade </p>

<p> class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class </p>

<p> for exceptional children that included students with </p>

<p> emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students </p>

<p> were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were </p>

<p> Native American. </p>

<p> The instructor was an African-American woman in her </p>

<p> twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching </p>

<p> style. She was careful to include all of the students in </p>

<p> the lesson. </p>

<p> Because this was a class for exceptional children, </p>

<p> the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in </p>

<p> regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher indicated that the length of the class and </p>

<p> how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally </p>

<p> depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson </p>

<p> the students are absorbing and their interest level. She </p>

<p> indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught </p>

<p> two or three times a week. </p>

<p> The observed lesson was about learning how to make </p>

<p> healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and </p>

<p> use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking </p>

<p> and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are </p>

<p> helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of </p>

<p> concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure </p>

<p> contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning </p>

<p> labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use </p>

<p> to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily </p>

<p> question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each </p>

<p> student to participate. The teacher used a variety of </p>

<p> visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, </p>

<p> and a collection of common medications that can be </p>

<p> inappropriately used. </p>

<p> For the most part, the students were very </p>

<p> attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to </p>

<p> participate in the class. The teacher encouraged </p>

<p> participation by all the students. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on site visits to four schools </p>

<p> in three school districts. Two of the schools were </p>

<p> located in one rural school district; one of these </p>

<p> schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two </p>

<p> schools were located in adjacent school districts in an </p>

<p> urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did </p>

<p> not. </p>

<p> In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited </p>

<p> participation of teachers, parents, and the community </p>

<p> were reported. Both schools also mentioned having </p>

<p> inadequate resources for the program. Neither school </p>

<p> reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both </p>

<p> schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was </p>

<p> stressed. </p>

<p> Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Both reported that </p>

<p> implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both </p>

<p> schools reported wanting one person who would be </p>

<p> responsible for administering the drug prevention program </p>

<p> in the school. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 7 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program </p>

<p> with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior </p>

<p> high school students. The original core curriculum used </p>

<p> in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a </p>

<p> revised core curriculum will be implemented in September </p>

<p> 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are </p>

<p> not included in the review because they are more recent, </p>

<p> not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the </p>

<p> comprehensive program. </p>

<p> The purpose of the current review is to assess the </p>

<p> short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to </p>

<p> synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 </p>

<p> We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published </p>

<p> and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., </p>

<p> since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further </p>

<p> review those studies that met specified methodological </p>

<p> criteria. To establish a comparable measure of </p>

<p> effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes </p>

<p> for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the </p>

<p> context of other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect </p>

<p> sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that </p>

<p> target youth of similar age. </p>

<p> This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly </p>

<p> summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, </p>

<p> we provide some general background on meta-analysis and </p>

<p> describe the methodological criteria used to select </p>

<p> evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight </p>

<p> studies that met the criteria and provide an overall </p>

<p> description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the </p>

<p> reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these </p>

<p> studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes </p>

<p> averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of </p>

<p> other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss </p>

<p> several methodological considerations related to the </p>

<p> evaluations included in our review that are important to </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the </p>

<p> results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils </p>

<p> in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or </p>

<p> sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are </p>

<p> usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The </p>

<p> lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in </p>

<p> order to recognize and resist social pressures to use </p>

<p> drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons </p>

<p> emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, </p>

<p> and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers </p>

<p> use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, </p>

<p> group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, </p>

<p> audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- </p>

<p> plays. </p>

<p> Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> suggest that it should be successful as a drug use </p>

<p> prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes </p>

<p> elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be </p>

<p> effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social </p>

<p> competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- </p>

<p> tive programs have shown more promise than those using </p>

<p> more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching </p>

<p> strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among </p>

<p> pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children </p>

<p> at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to </p>

<p> antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- </p>

<p> tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting &amp; Bauvais, </p>

<p> 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, </p>

<p> alcohol, and marijuana--the &quot;gateway drugs&quot; that
children </p>

<p> tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, &amp; Bell, </p>

<p> 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of </p>

<p> the curriculum and extensive training of the officers </p>

<p> helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). </p>

<p> Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria </p>

<p> Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the </p>

<p> research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis </p>

<p> is to discover whether some pattern of results is </p>

<p> discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same </p>

<p> research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, &amp; </p>

<p> Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs </p>

<p> from a traditional narrative review of studies by </p>

<p> providing statistical techniques for summarizing the </p>

<p> research findings from the studies. By quantifying </p>

<p> outcomes across studies and making them comparable with </p>

<p> each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather </p>

<p> than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about </p>

<p> patterns of study results. </p>

<p> Three basic steps are commonly followed in </p>

<p> conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, </p>

<p> all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are </p>

<p> selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori </p>

<p> defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes </p>

<p> are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent </p>

<p> the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a </p>

<p> common metric. This transformation allows comparisons </p>

<p> across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes </p>

<p> across studies usually are tested. We followed these </p>

<p> three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible </p>

<p> causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The </p>

<p> relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded </p>

<p> this type of analysis. </p>

<p> In selecting studies, our review focused on </p>

<p> student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that </p>

<p> measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or </p>

<p> other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, </p>

<p> such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that </p>

<p> reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also </p>

<p> did not consider the results of parent, teacher, </p>

<p> administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which </p>

<p> sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation </p>

<p> effort. (For information about the opinions of school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators concerning </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there </p>

<p> are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other </p>

<p> than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as </p>

<p> improved school and police relations and greater trust in </p>

<p> law enforcement among youth. </p>

<p> We attempted to locate all the quantitative </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five </p>

<p> RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be </p>

<p> involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the </p>

<p> published and unpublished literature using several data </p>

<p> bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, </p>

<p> PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 </p>

<p> Through the combined sources, we identified 18 </p>

<p> quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States </p>

<p> and one Canadian province. The location and primary </p>

<p> reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple </p>

<p> reports or papers; we generally used the final, most </p>

<p> complete report or the published paper for our review. </p>

<p> From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include </p>

<p> in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 </p>

<p> (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- </p>

<p> posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; </p>

<p> and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative </p>

<p> outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were </p>

<p> excluded if they did not control for preexisting </p>

<p> differences on measured outcomes with either change </p>

<p> scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, </p>

<p> 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of </p>

<p> results, we used only results based on immediate </p>

<p> posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term </p>

<p> evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term </p>

<p> effects of the core curriculum. </p>

<p> We selected these criteria because they help to </p>

<p> ensure confidence in the study results by removing a </p>

<p> number of alternative explanations, other than true </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes </p>

<p> observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison </p>

<p> group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not </p>

<p> receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine </p>

<p> whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them </p>

<p> or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not </p>

<p> receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, </p>

<p> then the cause is due to some other factor, such as </p>

<p> maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures </p>

<p> (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.

<p> *Study selected for further review (with State </p>

<p> abbreviation). </p>

<p> for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the </p>

<p> absence of random assignment, this assumption must be </p>

<p> tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a </p>

<p> benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures </p>

<p> after program implementation. Reliably operationalized </p>

<p> measures of the outcomes of interest (the third </p>

<p> criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs </p>

<p> intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 </p>

<p> For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, </p>

<p> attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales </p>

<p> to be more reliable than single-item measures. </p>

<p> We also examined a number of other methodological </p>

<p> features, such as the correspondence between the unit of </p>

<p> assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design </p>

<p> was used, whether schools in the intervention and </p>

<p> comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition </p>

<p> rates were reported and examined. Although these factors </p>

<p> were considered in assessing the overall methodological </p>

<p> rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on </p>

<p> the basis of these criteria. </p>

<p> Studies Selected </p>

<p> Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the </p>

<p> criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional </p>

<p> study met the methodological criteria but did not </p>

<p> administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementation and so could not be included in the </p>

<p> analysis of immediate effects (Nyre &amp; Rose, 1987; Nyre, </p>

<p> Rose, &amp; Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are </p>

<p> indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit </p>

<p> 7.2. A more complete description of each study is </p>

<p> provided in Appendix B. </p>

<p> Each of the evaluations represented a State or </p>

<p> local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either </p>

<p> the entire population of schools in a locale or a </p>

<p> convenience sample. The number of student subjects in </p>

<p> all studies was large; each study included at least 10 </p>

<p> schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the </p>

<p> combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic </p>

<p> information about each sample, including gender, </p>

<p> race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not </p>

<p> consistently given across studies. Based on the </p>

<p> information available, the samples were about equally </p>

<p> divided between girls and boys; included white, </p>

<p> black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American </p>

<p> youth, with whites usually in the majority; and </p>

<p> represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 </p>

<p> Information was generally not given on the SES of the </p>

<p> sample. </p>

<p> Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control </p>

<p> groups was by school for all eight studies. In one </p>

<p> study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain </p>

<p> schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group </p>

<p> classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by </p>

<p> their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these </p>

<p> control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools </p>

<p> with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the </p>

<p> studies used a true experimental design in which schools </p>

<p> were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; </p>

<p> a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of </p>

<p> the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a </p>

<p> nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 </p>

<p> For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; </p>

<p> if the criterion was stated, usually it was the </p>

<p> administrative convenience of either the school district </p>

<p> or law enforcement agency.=20 </p>

<p> A fundamental consideration in reviewing the </p>

<p> studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> groups before the intervention. Because there were </p>

<p> relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging </p>

<p> from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all </p>

<p> except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence </p>

<p> between groups was obtained without prior matching or </p>

<p> blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half </p>

<p> the studies matched comparison schools on selected </p>

<p> demographic characteristics. The majority of studies </p>

<p> (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the </p>

<p> comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for </p>

<p> pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All </p>

<p> studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome </p>

<p> measures. </p>

used a pan= </p>

<p> el </p>

<p> design that </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique </p>

<p> identification code. </p>

<p> Outcome measures used in the studies were based on </p>

<p> responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of </p>

<p> the eight studies used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; six studies </p>

<p> reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) </p>

<p> that were generally high. Validity information, however, </p>

<p> was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either </p>

<p> a biochemical indicator or &quot;bogus pipeline&quot;
technique to </p>

<p> validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that </p>

<p> their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a </p>

<p> biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie </p>

<p> detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance </p>

<p> the validity of their responses (Bauman &amp; Dent, 1982). </p>

<p> As is unfortunately typical of school-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy </p>

<p> appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, </p>

<p> not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the </p>

<p> data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within </p>

<p> each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts </p>

<p> for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray &amp; Hannan, </p>

<p> 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and </p>

<p> analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the </p>

<p> statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 </p>

<p> The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is </p>

<p> a positive bias toward finding statistically significant </p>

<p> program effects (Murray &amp; Hannan, 1990). </p>

<p> Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which </p>

<p> generally were small. None of the three studies that </p>

<p> analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed </p>

<p> significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not </p>

<p> more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 </p>

<p> Although attrition usually is greater among drug users </p>

<p> (Biglan &amp; Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, </p>

<p> when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use </p>

<p> prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes </p>

<p> To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference </p>

<p> between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and </p>

<p> the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by </p>

<p> dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D </p>

<p> (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Perry &amp; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard </p>

<p> deviations are not available, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> calculated using formulae developed to convert other test </p>

<p> statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to </p>

<p> effect sizes (Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). </p>

<p> Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation </p>

<p> units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect </p>

<p> size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a </p>

<p> result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for </p>

<p> example, indicates that the intervention group performed </p>

<p> one standard deviation unit better than the control group </p>

<p> on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear </p>

<p> conventions for defining &quot;small,&quot;
&quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;large&quot; </p>

<p> effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; </p>

<p> Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 </p>

<p> reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 </p>

<p> indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 </p>

<p> reflect stronger program effects. </p>

<p> For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we </p>

<p> calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes </p>

<p> that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The </p>

<p> six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about </p>

<p> drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward </p>

<p> police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary </p>

<p> statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics </p>

<p> reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values </p>

<p> as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any </p>

<p> differences between the comparison groups prior to the </p>

<p> intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes </p>

<p> (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used </p>

<p> statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics (six of eight studies). </p>

<p> Some studies did not include all six outcomes of </p>

<p> interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than </p>

<p> one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such </p>

<p> as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate </p>

<p> effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure </p>

<p> yielded one effect size per study for each type of </p>

<p> measured outcome. In the one study that reported only </p>

<p> that a measured outcome was not statistically significant </p>

<p> and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a </p>

<p> value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect </p>

<p> sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, </p>

<p> tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes </p>

<p> across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we </p>

<p> also considered use of these substances separately. Use </p>

<p> of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some </p>

<p> studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to </p>

<p> produce meaningful effects. </p>

<p> The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest </p>

<p> for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although </p>

<p> most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for </p>

<p> knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight </p>

<p> studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward </p>

<p> police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are </p>

<p> for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The </p>

<p> higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use </p>

<p> is consistent with other studies and supports the </p>

<p> conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than </p>

<p> behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986). </p>

<p> In addition to calculating one effect size for each </p>

<p> outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of </p>

<p> outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean </p>

<p> provides a summary measure across the eight studies that </p>

<p> is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness </p>

<p> with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides </p>

<p> a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean </p>

<p> because estimates from larger samples are given more </p>

<p> weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by </p>

<p> the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the </p>

<p> sample size (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). The effect size </p>

<p> estimates from larger studies are generally more precise </p>

<p> than those from smaller studies (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and </p>

<p> lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, </p>

<p> the estimate would fall within these bounds. To </p>

<p> calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by </p>

<p> the square root of one divided by the sum of the study </p>

<p> weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges &amp;
</p>

<p> Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest </p>

<p> and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are </p>

<p> depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed </p>

<p> by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and </p>

<p> drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for </p>

<p> knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are </p>

<p> statistically significant. The statistical significance </p>

<p> of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be </p>

<p> interpreted cautiously because the significance may be </p>

<p> positively influenced by the failure of most studies to </p>

<p> account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s Weighted
Mean </p>

<p> Effect Size (and 95% Confidence </p>

<p> Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- </p>

<p> diate Posttest </p>

<p> clustered by school. The confidence interval for the </p>

<p> weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with </p>

<p> zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from </p>

<p> zero. </p>

<p> Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana </p>

<p> use for the drug use effect size could obscure </p>

<p> substantial differences among substances, we calculated </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for </p>

<p> alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the </p>

<p> individual effect sizes for any of the three substances </p>

<p> from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate </p>

<p> effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); </p>

<p> for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for </p>

<p> marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean </p>

<p> for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 </p>

<p> The range of effect sizes, both individually by </p>

<p> study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has been more effective at immediate posttest in </p>

<p> influencing some outcomes than others. The core </p>

<p> curriculum has been most effective in increasing </p>

<p> knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 </p>

<p> Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes </p>

<p> for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, </p>

<p> overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in </p>

<p> influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on </p>

<p> these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least </p>

<p> effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use </p>

<p> outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The </p>

<p> small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs </p>

<p> and police reflect, at least in part, the low levels of </p>

<p> drug use by this age group and their already negative </p>

<p> attitudes about drugs and positive attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth </p>

<p> To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- </p>

<p> based drug use prevention programs, we compared the </p>

<p> weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean </p>

<p> effect sizes computed for similar programs. For </p>

<p> comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's </p>

<p> recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most </p>

<p> appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we </p>

<p> obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, </p>

<p> excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 </p>

<p> Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the </p>

<p> fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle </p>

<p> school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in </p>

<p> elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the </p>

<p> interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in </p>

<p> geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not </p>

<p> reported across all studies. The available data suggest </p>

<p> that the studies in Tobler's review represented both </p>

<p> white and minority populations and included urban, </p>

<p> suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 </p>

<p> These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs </p>

<p> included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from </p>

<p> Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and </p>

<p> listed in Appendix C. </p>

<p> We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison </p>

<p> because it is more similar to our review than other meta- </p>

<p> analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar </p>

<p> processes and criteria to identify and select program </p>

<p> evaluations for examination and included both published </p>

<p> and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, </p>

<p> Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations </p>

<p> that included a control or comparison group and used a </p>

<p> pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random </p>

<p> assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate </p>

<p> weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome </p>

<p> measures that are comparable to four of our outcome </p>

<p> measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social </p>

<p> skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, </p>

<p> however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not </p>

<p> measure drug use and that included results from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs </p>

<p> focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as </p>

<p> in D.A.R.E. The collective impact of these Exhibit 7.5

<p> tions. Some publications reported on more than </p>

<p> of these references. </p>

<p> differences should be minimal, however. Overall, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in </p>

<p> terms of program focus, study methodology, and target </p>

<p> audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that </p>

<p> the studies typically did not correct for the correlation </p>

<p> among students in the same school. As explained for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 </p>

<p> Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally </p>

<p> made adjustments for this interdependence of </p>

<p> observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect </p>

<p> sizes should be minimal. </p>

<p> The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis are classified into two broad categories based </p>

<p> on typical combinations of program content and program </p>

<p> process (process describes the teaching approach, or how </p>

<p> the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and </p>

<p> interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 </p>

<p> Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal </p>

<p> factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 </p>

<p> Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, </p>

<p> increase problem-solving skills, and promote values </p>

<p> clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected </p>

<p> to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain </p>

<p> from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced </p>

<p> by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory </p>

<p> activities often involve teacher-led discussions. </p>

<p> Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal </p>

<p> factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 </p>

<p> Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use </p>

<p> drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting </p>

<p> general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about </p>

<p> the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process </p>

<p> emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among </p>

<p> peers, and it encourages active participation of all </p>

<p> students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. </p>

<p> Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that </p>

<p> programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most </p>

<p> effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger </p>

<p> effect sizes in all four outcome measures than </p>

<p> noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features </p>

<p> of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we </p>

<p> compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence </p>

<p> intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two </p>

<p> types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 </p>

<p> To test whether the mean effect sizes differed </p>

<p> significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive </p>

<p> programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive </p>

<p> programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval </p>

<p> around the difference between the means. If the </p>

<p> confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the </p>

<p> difference between the two effect size means is not </p>

<p> statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence </p>

<p> interval does not include zero, then the means are </p>

<p> determined to be significantly different; that is, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the </p>

<p> mean for the comparison programs. The difference between </p>

<p> the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both </p>

<p> A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect </p>

<p> sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed </p>

<p> by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective </p>

<p> in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes </p>

<p> than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge </p>

<p> difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has </p>

<p> been less effective, however, than interactive programs </p>

<p> across all outcome measures, most prominently for social </p>

<p> skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size </p>

<p> means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was </p>

<p> not statistically significant was for knowledge. For </p>

<p> drug use, the average effect size for interactive </p>

<p> programs was three times greater than the average </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times </p>

<p> greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times </p>

<p> greater. These findings suggest that greater </p>

<p> effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils </p>

<p> than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum. </p>

<p> Methodological Considerations </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations relating to </p>

<p> the evaluations included in our review and to the </p>

<p> approach we used in conducting our review bear on the </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations selected for review are methodologically </p>

<p> strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate </p>

<p> for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria </p>

<p> to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the </p>

<p> evaluations we selected had a comparison group, </p>

<p> administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, </p>

<p> we can be reasonably confident in their findings. </p>

<p> Eight evaluations were included in the review; this </p>

<p> is not a large number compared with the vast number of </p>

<p> sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far </p>

<p> exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other </p>

<p> widely available drug use prevention program. Most </p>

<p> prevention programs developed and evaluated by </p>

<p> researchers have been much less widely implemented, and </p>

<p> have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More </p>

<p> important, however, when considering the adequacy of the </p>

<p> number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> curriculum content and method of delivery across </p>

<p> implementation sites, and the consistent results found </p>

<p> across geographically heterogeneous studies. This </p>

<p> uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient </p>

<p> number of evaluations were identified for assessment of </p>

<p> the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even </p>

<p> so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect </p>

<p> sizes for each outcome. </p>

<p> The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies </p>

<p> may have been attenuated compared with the comparison </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs because the control groups </p>

<p> were not pure &quot;no treatment&quot; groups. As documented
by </p>

<p> Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower </p>

<p> when the control group receives some sort of drug </p>

<p> education. Information generally was lacking from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions </p>

<p> received by the control groups, but it is likely that </p>

<p> most control groups received some drug education because </p>

<p> the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 </p>

<p> However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison </p>

<p> programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted </p>

<p> between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may </p>

<p> suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower </p>

<p> effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the </p>

<p> interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in </p>

<p> part to the likelihood that the control groups for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than </p>

<p> did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. </p>

<p> Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated </p>

<p> by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available </p>

<p> curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions </p>

<p> were implemented by service providers and the evaluations </p>

<p> were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of </p>

<p> efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation </p>

<p> research may be greater, the implementation conditions </p>

<p> more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and </p>

<p> control greater than would be the case for a program that </p>

<p> is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness </p>

<p> may be inevitable once programs are implemented under </p>

<p> real-world conditions. This could be an important factor </p>

<p> in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. </p>

<p> Differences in the studies selected for our </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also </p>

<p> contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between these programs. The differences include the </p>

<p> exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug </p>

<p> use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the </p>

<p> programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than </p>

<p> elementary school, and some programs focused on a single </p>

<p> drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is </p>

<p> the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these </p>

<p> differences could decrease, increase, or not change the </p>

<p> relative differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> differences might have been less if programs focused on a </p>

<p> single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis. It is possible that single substance programs </p>

<p> have greater impact on use of that substance than generic </p>

<p> drug education programs, although study of this </p>

<p> possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, </p>

<p> 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been </p>

<p> greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond </p>

<p> immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to </p>

<p> decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, &amp; </p>

<p> McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, &amp; Pallonen, </p>

<p> 1989). The limited number of programs precluded </p>

<p> assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether </p>

<p> program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth </p>

<p> graders in elementary versus middle school. </p>

<p> Finally, it is possible that our results might have </p>

<p> differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze </p>

<p> effect sizes while controlling the effects of other </p>

<p> factors. In addition to the differences between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is </p>

<p> possible that other factors may have varied across the </p>

<p> intervention programs and associated evaluation studies </p>

<p> that contributed to the observed differences in effect </p>

<p> sizes. For example, substantial variation in </p>

<p> characteristics of the students (e.g., in </p>

<p> race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., </p>

<p> variations in program intensity), and features of the </p>

<p> research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to the </p>

<p> differences in program effects. In other words, some of </p>

<p> the differences in effect sizes observed between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due </p>

<p> to other factors than the type of program.=20 </p>

<p> Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested </p>

<p> because of the small number of studies. Further testing </p>

<p> is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies identified by this review, eight met specified </p>

<p> methodological criteria and were selected for further </p>

<p> review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control </p>

<p> group, administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, </p>

<p> both individually by study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had </p>

<p> strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and </p>

<p> significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum </p>

<p> had smaller, although statistically significant, effects </p>

<p> on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, </p>

<p> and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate </p>

<p> effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 </p>

<p> Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was </p>

<p> statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs targeted at same-age youth. The original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with </p>

<p> noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which </p>

<p> emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional </p>

<p> teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared </p>

<p> less favorably, however, with interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an </p>

<p> interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the </p>

<p> most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations should be </p>

<p> noted in interpreting the results of this review. These </p>

<p> include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies in our review; the purity of the control groups </p>

<p> in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the </p>

<p> comparison programs; and the relative impacts of </p>

<p> commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale </p>

<p> research-based interventions; and the small number of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing </p>

<p> other potential explanations for differences in program </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 8 </p>

<p> DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired </p>

<p> from our implementation and outcome assessments of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, </p>

<p> prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a </p>

<p> variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the </p>

<p> findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that </p>

<p> although some findings attest to the strengths and </p>

<p> robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 </p>

<p> This final chapter presents a discussion of these </p>

<p> findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight </p>

<p> the key findings and, where appropriate, make </p>

<p> recommendations for programmatic changes and additional </p>

<p> research. =20 </p>

<p> This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 </p>

<p> Highlights from the implementation assessment are </p>

<p> presented in the first section, followed by key findings </p>

<p> from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of </p>

<p> the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our </p>

<p> discussion is organized by some of the questions that </p>

<p> guided these study components. In the final section, we </p>

<p> attempt to synthesize the most important findings and </p>

<p> present overall conclusions derived from the study. </p>

<p> Implementation Assessment </p>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an </p>

<p> implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two </p>

<p> primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an </p>

<p> assessment of the organizational structure and operation </p>

<p> of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn </p>

<p> what factors contribute to the effective implementation </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine </p>

<p> how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific </p>

<p> populations. </p>

<p> To address these issues, we collected data from </p>

<p> sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> institution. We presented information concerning </p>

<p> operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and </p>

<p> local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained </p>

<p> information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors </p>

<p> from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a </p>

<p> review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, and site visits to four purposively </p>

<p> selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). </p>

<p> How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and </p>

<p> how does D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence compare with that of other curricula? </p>

<p> One of the most important findings of this study </p>

<p> was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State </p>

<p> coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sample
of school </p>

<p> districts, we estimate that over half the districts in </p>

<p> the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curricula in one or more of their schools. In </p>

<p> comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention </p>

<p> programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were </p>

<p> used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the </p>

<p> districts, respectively. </p>

<p> Another important finding is that the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase </p>

<p> substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> planned to expand its use. Of those districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, </p>

<p> and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about </p>

<p> using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Slightly over half of all school districts </p>

<p> implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted </p>

<p> at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the </p>

<p> K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, </p>

<p> and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the </p>

<p> school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% </p>

<p> at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Around 22% of the school </p>

<p> districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the </p>

<p> middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior </p>

<p> high level. =20 </p>

<p> Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by </p>

<p> demographic </p>

<p> characteristics of school districts, such as geographic </p>

<p> region, urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with </p>

<p> other curricula in this </p>

<p> regard? </p>

<p> The Midwest region had the highest percentage of </p>

<p> districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the </p>

<p> Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and </p>

<p> Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the </p>

<p> Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the </p>

<p> East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was </p>

<p> lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of </p>

<p> program use in the Southwest can probably be largely </p>

<p> attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater </p>

<p> difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to </p>

<p> geographically dispersed schools. </p>

<p> There were no statistically significant differences </p>

<p> in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the </p>

<p> minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Urban/suburban school districts were, however, </p>

<p> significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than </p>

<p> rural districts. Further, large districts were </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small districts to use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be </p>

<p> attributed to the relatively greater resources available </p>

<p> to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to </p>

<p> free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> It is difficult to determine what adjustments might </p>

<p> make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school </p>

<p> districts. We believe that ways of improving access to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 </p>

<p> For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to </p>

<p> favor rural and small school districts instead of </p>

<p> distribution solely on a per capita basis could be </p>

<p> explored. =20 </p>

<p> How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs </p>

<p> offered in schools? </p>

<p> Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention </p>

<p> program can or should stand alone in a school district; </p>

<p> instead, such programs should be integrated into a </p>

<p> comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally </p>

<p> appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must </p>

<p> implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Even were a school district to implement all four of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention </p>

<p> programming would still be required in the grades to </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that </p>

<p> only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no </p>

<p> other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that </p>

<p> the program was &quot;very well&quot; integrated with other </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other </p>

<p> drug (AOD) programs </p>

<p> in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? </p>

<p> The school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not </p>

<p> only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the </p>

<p> coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents </p>

<p> and the community. These ratings were also markedly </p>

<p> higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> The responses of the coordinators also indicated </p>

<p> the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is </p>

<p> taught, as &quot;very satisfactory&quot;; over three-quarters
gave </p>

<p> the same rating to how students receive it. This </p>

<p> endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with </p>

<p> coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; </p>

<p> only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> rated these programs as highly. =20 </p>

<p> A close examination of these findings reveals that </p>

<p> coordinators in districts with a high percentage of </p>

<p> minority students were more likely to rate students' </p>

<p> receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in </p>

<p> districts serving predominantly white students. This </p>

<p> finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or </p>

<p> SES because comparisons between coordinators from these </p>

<p> pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by </p>

<p> rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically </p>

<p> significant. =20 </p>

<p> Of even greater importance are the satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very </p>

<p> satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter </p>

<p> of those with other AOD programs reported that they were </p>

<p> very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted </p>

<p> to a community's </p>

<p> particular needs? </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and </p>

<p> consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 </p>

<p> During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed </p>

<p> not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the </p>

<p> curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one </p>

<p> modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in </p>

<p> schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. </p>

<p> Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to </p>

<p> some degree, however modest. The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs was drug availability at their </p>

<p> schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints </p>

<p> as to the types of topics introduced, which included </p>

<p> discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse </p>

<p> at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit </p>

<p> to the urban school district, we learned that some police </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences into </p>

<p> their lessons. The second and third most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> AOD programs were student/community poverty and </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition. </p>

<p> Although we recognize that some tailoring of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be </p>

<p> appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and </p>

<p> careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly </p>

<p> suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of </p>

<p> limitations in the curricula and of substantive </p>

<p> modifications of the curricula originating from that </p>

<p> agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the </p>

<p> program at will would quickly result in disintegration of </p>

<p> the curriculum and the program. </p>

<p> To what extent are classroom teachers and other community </p>

<p> members or </p>

<p> agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? </p>

<p> The original core curriculum, which was in use when </p>

<p> the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers </p>

<p> to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> objectives to students. However, teachers played little </p>

<p> active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior </p>

<p> high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even </p>

<p> trained together. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts </p>

<p> remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in </p>

<p> 84% teachers were reported as &quot;actively involved&quot;
in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages </p>

<p> classroom teachers to take a more active role. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for </p>

<p> an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, </p>

<p> structured orientation and discussion. To the extent </p>

<p> that time and resources permit, we encourage the </p>

<p> co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular </p>

<p> level because we believe that such training would enhance </p>

<p> effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active </p>

<p> involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and </p>

<p> outside of the school. Half of the prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that school staff, other than </p>

<p> classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were </p>

<p> actively involved. This level of involvement surely </p>

<p> makes a major contribution to the high level of </p>

<p> enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a </p>

<p> relatively few coordinators reported that &quot;youth
groups&quot; </p>

<p> were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the </p>

<p> involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to </p>

<p> reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish </p>

<p> anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 </p>

<p> About half of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site </p>

<p> visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather </p>

<p> detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents </p>

<p> through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we </p>

<p> hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the </p>

<p> past have proved futile because the parents who are most </p>

<p> in need of educational intervention are also the most </p>

<p> difficult to reach and most resistant to attending </p>

<p> meetings. One additional method to involve parents more </p>

<p> directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child </p>

<p> homework exercises that, at the very least, will open </p>

<p> vital lines of communication between parent and child </p>

<p> concerning drug use. A second method that could </p>

<p> supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to </p>

<p> develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could </p>

<p> be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a </p>

<p> synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as </p>

<p> provide information about how to effectively reinforce </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include </p>

<p> advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress </p>

<p> the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free </p>

<p> life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and </p>

<p> weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies </p>

<p> designed to reach parents who may not respond to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. </p>

<p> What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment </p>

<p> referral for students </p>

<p> who already have substance abuse problems? </p>

<p> An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can </p>

<p> undertake is to serve as members of student assistance </p>

<p> program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had </p>

<p> both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had </p>

<p> been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most </p>

<p> of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as </p>

<p> they did guidance counselors (and much higher than </p>

<p> teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We </p>

<p> recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with </p>

<p> SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved </p>

<p> in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for </p>

<p> officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in </p>

<p> conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that </p>

<p> the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have </p>

<p> drug problems may be maintained. </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and </p>

<p> State level, and what </p>

<p> are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? </p>

<p> At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are </p>

<p> overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization </p>

<p> that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, </p>

<p> monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this </p>

<p> capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of </p>

<p> regional and State organizations. These include five </p>

<p> RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory </p>

<p> Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> concerning the accreditation of State-level training </p>

<p> centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff </p>

<p> from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and </p>

<p> assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning </p>

<p> modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered </p>

<p> nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the </p>

<p> program in that State; such organizations currently exist </p>

<p> in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that </p>

<p> they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that </p>

<p> currently lack such an organization, there is typically a </p>

<p> State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In </p>

<p> addition, 42 States currently have developed State </p>

<p> Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to </p>

<p> conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Updating and improving curricular materials and </p>

<p> teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee </p>

<p> chair. It is our understanding that the committee's </p>

<p> charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current </p>

<p> and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating </p>

<p> relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the </p>

<p> considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to </p>

<p> make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently </p>

<p> than once every 5 years, at a minimum. </p>

<p> Another source of expertise that should be tapped </p>

<p> as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the </p>

<p> establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> education at both the State and local levels. At the </p>

<p> national level, an educational consultant from each of </p>

<p> the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> However, it is our understanding that this group lacks </p>

<p> representation from a national-level education agency.=20 </p>

<p> We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request an
appropriate member of= </p>

<p> the </p>

<p> U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio </p>

<p> member, who should represent the department's extensive </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Such an individual would be </p>

<p> able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how </p>

<p> effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of </p>

<p> Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as </p>

<p> long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific </p>

<p> line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 </p>

<p> State coordinators informed us that over one-third </p>

<p> of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a </p>

<p> proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since </p>

<p> our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in </p>

<p> developing and maintaining communications and positive </p>

<p> relationships among the various agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such </p>

<p> boards. </p>

<p> The great majority of the PABs comprise </p>

<p> representatives of both State and local law enforcement </p>

<p> and education. Other key individuals from the community </p>

<p> who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could </p>

<p> provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> were less well represented. These include parents, </p>

<p> members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- </p>

<p> large, members of associations of educators, and business </p>

<p> representatives. The latter could be particularly </p>

<p> helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus </p>

<p> recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine </p>

<p> their representation and seek ways to reach out to new </p>

<p> and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their </p>

<p> membership. </p>

<p> Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations have strong ties to education at the State </p>

<p> level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators reported a great deal of communication with </p>

<p> the State Department of Education, and another 50% </p>

<p> reported having at least some communication. We also </p>

<p> note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated </p>

<p> with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs </p>

<p> were chaired by staff members from State or local </p>

<p> education departments. The need to improve communication </p>

<p> with their State's education departments was mentioned by </p>

<p> several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. </p>

<p> One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain </p>

<p> educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds </p>

<p> of the State coordinators reported employing such a </p>

<p> consultant, and almost all of the States without </p>

<p> educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time </p>

<p> educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that </p>

<p> all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational </p>

<p> consultants. </p>

<p> In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> employed their own educational consultants. In most </p>

<p> States, however, educational consultants were employed by </p>

<p> education departments. We believe the liaison between </p>

<p> law enforcement and education will be most effective if </p>

<p> the consultants are based in the State Departments of </p>

<p> Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of </p>

<p> coordination both with the State Departments of Education </p>

<p> as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in </p>

<p> particular, these consultants should be members of the </p>

<p> departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 </p>

<p> Certainly, regardless of whether the education </p>

<p> consultants are employed by education or directly by the </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate </p>

<p> means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- </p>

<p> level educational agencies. By the same token, education </p>

<p> agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir </p>

<p> responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in </p>

<p> planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be </p>

<p> truly effective, education and law enforcement need to </p>

<p> work together in a partnership at the national and State </p>

<p> levels as well as at the local level. </p>

<p> Educational consultants' roles may vary, but </p>

<p> besides providing a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two </p>

<p> organizations, the consultants should help ensure that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, </p>

<p> developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could </p>

<p> assist with program evaluation and with monitoring </p>

<p> officer performance in the classroom. It may be </p>

<p> appropriate to consider expanding the roles of </p>

<p> educational consultants further, perhaps to provide </p>

<p> assistance in these areas. =20 </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? </p>

<p> At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, </p>

<p> primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 </p>

<p> Officer selection and classroom activities was most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police </p>

<p> department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the </p>

<p> responsibility of the school administration and staff, </p>

<p> and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was </p>

<p> shared by the police department, school administration </p>

<p> and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 </p>

<p> In a number of places throughout this report, we </p>

<p> have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture </p>

<p> between a local school district and a law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, and we have emphasized the importance of </p>

<p> developing a positive relationship between the two from </p>

<p> the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the </p>

<p> local level is with written agreements that clearly state </p>

<p> the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half </p>

<p> of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their </p>

<p> districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some </p>

<p> of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply </p>

<p> not have known that a written agreement existed, </p>

<p> particularly if they were new in their position and the </p>

<p> agreement had been written before they were employed. We </p>

<p> recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such </p>

<p> agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that </p>

<p> the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ </p>

<p> staff at least every other year. This biennial review </p>

<p> would ensure that all parties are aware of their </p>

<p> responsibilities and could also serve as forums to </p>

<p> discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and </p>

<p> to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> can serve the schools. They could also provide </p>

<p> opportunities for the school district to recognize the </p>

<p> officer's contribution. </p>

<p> Another way to engender a positive collaboration </p>

<p> between law enforcement and education is by developing </p>

<p> close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including </p>

<p> providing a role model for new officers, sharing the </p>

<p> burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and </p>

<p> increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We </p>

<p> learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey </p>

<p> that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> message into their other activities in the classroom, so </p>

<p> that the program has a strong foundation in this area on </p>

<p> which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both </p>

<p> formally at the beginning of the semester and informally </p>

<p> as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation </p>

<p> should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an </p>

<p> anti-drug message. </p>

<p> What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, </p>

<p> State, and local levels? </p>

<p> At the national/regional level, funding is received </p>

<p> primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the </p>

<p> need to find permanent funding sources that will </p>

<p> supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less </p>

<p> vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One </p>

<p> solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen </p>

<p> reliance on State or local support, particularly the </p>

<p> latter. =20 </p>

<p> The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive </p>

<p> funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States </p>

<p> received funding from governors' grants, grants from </p>

<p> other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States </p>

<p> reported that they received no funding for their State- </p>

<p> level operations, and around one-third mentioned that </p>

<p> maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new </p>

<p> funding sources were among the most significant issues </p>

<p> facing them. If they are to discharge multiple </p>

<p> responsibilities for developing and managing their </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have </p>

<p> sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various </p>

<p> sources of support used by the State programs, and how </p>

<p> these have been obtained, and then provide technical </p>

<p> assistance to those States that currently operate with </p>

<p> either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting </p>

<p> the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing </p>

<p> modest grant programs to assist States. =20 </p>

<p> At the local level, the cost of assigning a police </p>

<p> officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city </p>

<p> or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, </p>

<p> by the community. Only a small minority of prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs </p>

<p> were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The </p>

<p> coordinators also informed us that primary support for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds </p>

<p> also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did </p>

<p> (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that </p>

<p> non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more </p>

<p> dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given </p>

<p> projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand </p>

<p> may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will </p>

<p> prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever </p>

<p> tighter budgets. </p>

<p> How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of </p>

<p> an expanding and changing program? </p>

<p> As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently </p>

<p> been revised, and the new version is currently being </p>

<p> implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular </p>

<p> changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- </p>

<p> consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed </p>

<p> against the substantial costs associated with updating </p>

<p> and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula </p>

<p> will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to </p>

<p> remain on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of drug prevention </p>

<p> programming.=20 </p>

<p> To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping </p>

<p> officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, </p>

<p> the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers </p>

<p> with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide </p>

<p> formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- </p>

<p> service training method that should be considered is the </p>

<p> use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 </p>

<p> Because a substantial and growing number of police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it </p>

<p> could be an effective and cost-efficient means of </p>

<p> providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers around the country. Ideally, such a system </p>

<p> should be interactive to allow for discussions between </p>

<p> officers and trainers. Another less costly and more </p>

<p> accessible method that could be explored is the use of </p>

<p> videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to </p>

<p> curricula and teaching methods. Still another </p>

<p> alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to </p>

<p> distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method </p>

<p> could be made available at very low cost to all police </p>

<p> departments with computers and modems. We learned from </p>

<p> the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board </p>

<p> minutes that such a system was being developed by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. </p>

<p> In-service training should clearly not be </p>

<p> restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement </p>

<p> modifications to existing curricula. Such training could </p>

<p> also serve to increase the competence of newly minted </p>

<p> officers over their first semester. Regardless of how </p>

<p> powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction </p>

<p> to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget </p>

<p> some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, </p>

<p> they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for </p>

<p> the first time. One potentially useful device would be </p>

<p> to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real </p>

<p> classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to </p>

<p> review immediately prior to the first time they teach the </p>

<p> lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to </p>

<p> reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model </p>

<p> how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom </p>

<p> management techniques. Each videotape might highlight </p>

<p> dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a </p>

<p> discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw </p>

<p> out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond </p>

<p> when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or </p>

<p> family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively </p>

<p> short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed </p>

<p> by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in </p>

<p> mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also </p>

<p> help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- </p>

<p> that lessons be taught uniformly. </p>

<p> Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs </p>

<p> will become increasingly challenged to meet the training </p>

<p> and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs is critical because </p>

<p> the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, </p>

<p> mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as </p>

<p> assisting local law enforcement in developing and </p>

<p> maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that training and monitoring </p>

<p> officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We </p>

<p> recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to </p>

<p> establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff </p>

<p> in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; </p>

<p> several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need </p>

<p> support in developing lines of communication and </p>

<p> authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and </p>

<p> school districts, many of which have been operating with </p>

<p> a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing </p>

<p> directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs </p>

<p> brought together their constituent State coordinators at </p>

<p> least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and </p>

<p> concerns and provide technical assistance to the </p>

<p> coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the </p>

<p> need will still exist for resources to support individual </p>

<p> consultation between the RTCs and their respective State </p>

<p> coordinators. </p>

<p> As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in </p>

<p> school districts that currently lack the program is </p>

<p> likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts </p>

<p> indicated that they want either to begin or increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated </p>

<p> training may not be able to keep up with the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in </p>

<p> the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack </p>

<p> of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part </p>

<p> of school officials as officers were moved from one </p>

<p> school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those </p>

<p> communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but </p>

<p> which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide </p>

<p> greater support to their law enforcement agencies to </p>

<p> recruit and train additional officers. Further, the </p>

<p> surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior </p>

<p> and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each </p>

<p> community should examine the extent of the perceived need </p>

<p> for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range </p>

<p> plan to identify and fund additional officers as </p>

<p> necessary. </p>

<p> Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, </p>

<p> and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be </p>

<p> accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these </p>

<p> changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the </p>

<p> classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the </p>

<p> need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as </p>

<p> well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the </p>

<p> task. Adequate resources should also be made available </p>

<p> to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose </p>

<p> performance needs improvement. </p>

<p> Outcome Assessment </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in </p>

<p> Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were </p>

<p> (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness </p>

<p> as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the </p>

<p> quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these </p>

<p> studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based </p>

<p> on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. We did not include the junior high school, </p>

<p> senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the </p>

<p> outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as </p>

<p> prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum </p>

<p> implemented in September 1994. </p>

<p> Questions that guided the outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed in this section. </p>

<p> What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> assessments? </p>

<p> A number of States and smaller localities have been </p>

<p> actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in </p>

<p> Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify </p>

<p> studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in </p>

<p> twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies </p>

<p> collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum </p>

<p> seeks to change. </p>

<p> We defined a set of methodological criteria to use </p>

<p> in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study </p>

<p> methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the </p>

<p> evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the </p>

<p> study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students </p>

<p> in a control or comparison group who did not receive </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug </p>

<p> use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented </p>

<p> and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the </p>

<p> outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable </p>

<p> certainty that they were measured accurately; and </p>

<p> (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the </p>

<p> analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on </p>

<p> outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison </p>

<p> students. </p>

<p> Half of the 18 studies met these methodological </p>

<p> criteria; however, one study was not considered further </p>

<p> because the children were tested 1 year later rather than </p>

<p> immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies </p>

<p> were of this technical quality suggests that a high level </p>

<p> of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the </p>

<p> problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, </p>

<p> reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 </p>

<p> Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, </p>

<p> by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing </p>

<p> attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences </p>

<p> in students' background characteristics, or by using an </p>

<p> analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We </p>

<p> recommend that these features be incorporated into future </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> In assessing the findings of the eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be </p>

<p> noted that the studies are not a national sample of </p>

<p> representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, </p>

<p> however, that the findings tended to be consistent across </p>

<p> studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest </p>

<p> about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> are reliable. </p>

<p> What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? </p>

<p> Our review of studies suggested several </p>

<p> methodological issues that should be addressed directly </p>

<p> and critically by future studies. These include the </p>

<p> complete and careful reporting of the research design and </p>

<p> results, contamination of the comparison group, the </p>

<p> appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control </p>

<p> and analysis of attrition. </p>

<p> Although most of the studies we reviewed documented </p>

<p> the research procedures and methods, some did not provide </p>

<p> sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for </p>

<p> assessing and interpreting the results; information was </p>

<p> most often lacking in the description of the study </p>

<p> sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic </p>

<p> information such as whether recipients live in urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This </p>

<p> information is needed for assessing the degree to which </p>

<p> study results may be generalized. It also can be used to </p>

<p> test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by </p>

<p> characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural </p>

<p> students and among white, African American, and Hispanic </p>

<p> students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made </p>

<p> these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information </p>

<p> also is relevant when making comparisons between studies </p>

<p> (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug </p>

<p> use prevention programs) in order to assess the </p>

<p> similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. </p>

<p> An issue related to the completeness of reporting </p>

<p> is the need for reports of research to be accessible to </p>

<p> all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, </p>

<p> educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, </p>

<p> and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we </p>

<p> identified were not reported in the published literature, </p>

<p> and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally </p>

<p> important that reports be made quickly and widely </p>

<p> available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend </p>

<p> that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and </p>

<p> associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive </p>

<p> communication channels between local, state, and national </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt </p>

<p> identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. </p>

<p> One of the most important methodological issues </p>

<p> raised by our review is the potential contamination of </p>

<p> the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs. Although none of the </p>

<p> comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for </p>

<p> some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This </p>

<p> contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, </p>

<p> contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the </p>

<p> program and because of the various curricula now </p>

<p> prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is </p>

<p> increasingly possible, for example, for a control group </p>

<p> not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the </p>

<p> junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its </p>

<p> utility as a control group. </p>

<p> A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem </p>

<p> is that the prevalence of school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs in general makes it virtually </p>

<p> impossible to find a true &quot;no treatment&quot; control
group.=20 </p>

<p> Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education </p>

<p> program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative </p>

<p> rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of </p>

<p> little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both </p>

<p> programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of </p>

<p> limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the </p>

<p> control group received any drug use prevention </p>

<p> programming, much less provided information about it.=20 </p>

<p> Future studies should describe any prevention </p>

<p> interventions being delivered to the comparison group and </p>

<p> discuss the implications for the results. </p>

<p> An increasingly recognized methodological concern </p>

<p> in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the </p>

<p> importance of following an analysis strategy that is </p>

<p> appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray </p>

<p> &amp; Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically </p>

<p> rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical </p>

<p> analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is </p>

<p> usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by </p>

<p> individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account </p>

<p> the correlations among students in the same school or </p>

<p> classroom. This requires performing analyses at the </p>

<p> aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or </p>

<p> classroom means) or by statistically correcting for </p>

<p> within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses </p>

<p> that do not account for the correlations among subjects </p>

<p> tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across </p>

<p> schools and therefore overstate the statistical </p>

<p> significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because </p>

<p> statistical significance is often used as an indicator of </p>

<p> effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects </p>

<p> and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently </p>

<p> large samples to provide adequate statistical power for </p>

<p> detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed </p>

<p> had large numbers of students. However, because the </p>

<p> sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves </p>

<p> around schools as opposed to students, it is important </p>

<p> that sample size determinations in future studies be </p>

<p> based on analysis of the number of schools needed in </p>

<p> treatment and control conditions. </p>

<p> The final methodological issue raised by our review </p>

<p> of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of </p>

<p> study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external </p>

<p> and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were </p>

<p> usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for </p>

<p> review. However, data on demographic and pretest </p>

<p> differences in drug use and other predictor measures </p>

<p> between those who remained in and those who dropped out </p>

<p> of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition </p>

<p> analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to </p>

<p> follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or </p>

<p> those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it </p>

<p> compromises the external validity of the study by </p>

<p> limiting the population to which the study results may be </p>

<p> generalized. When differential attrition occurs by </p>

<p> experimental condition, for example, such that a larger </p>

<p> proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention </p>

<p> than the control group, the internal validity of the </p>

<p> study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either </p>

<p> positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the </p>

<p> intervention is limited. </p>

<p> We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations </p>

<p> not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological </p>

<p> criteria used for our review by addressing these </p>

<p> methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to </p>

<p> meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend </p>

<p> that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample </p>

<p> with sufficient statistical power to detect differences </p>

<p> in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the </p>

<p> way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze </p>

<p> differential attrition across treatment groups. In </p>

<p> addition, we strongly recommend the use of an </p>

<p> experimental research design, in which schools are </p>

<p> randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control </p>

<p> conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign </p>

<p> classrooms at random within schools, because the </p>

<p> activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may </p>

<p> affect (or &quot;contaminate&quot;) other classes. Although
there </p>

<p> frequently are difficulties inherent in using an </p>

<p> experimental design, results from experimental studies </p>

<p> always will be subject to fewer questions about validity </p>

<p> than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an </p>

<p> experimental study design and incorporated other </p>

<p> methodological features into the design. This level of </p>

<p> rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is </p>

<p> to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings </p>

<p> suggest? </p>

<p> As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic </p>

<p> techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous studies of the original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required </p>

<p> calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use </p>

<p> and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and </p>

<p> then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes </p>

<p> facilitate comparing and summarizing results across </p>

<p> studies because they transform the results of the </p>

<p> studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety </p>

<p> of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in </p>

<p> terms of statistical output, the results of one study are </p>

<p> comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, </p>

<p> effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness </p>

<p> than comparing whether results are statistically </p>

<p> significant from one study to another. This is because </p>

<p> statistical significance can be influenced by such </p>

<p> factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making </p>

<p> comparisons problematic. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered </p>

<p> both within each study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate </p>

<p> posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in </p>

<p> enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for these outcomes were statistically </p>

<p> significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is </p>

<p> consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest </p>

<p> effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, </p>

<p> supporting the general observation that knowledge is more </p>

<p> amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged </p>

<p> across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes </p>

<p> were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social </p>

<p> skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these </p>

<p> areas. </p>

<p> The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug </p>

<p> use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and </p>

<p> averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was </p>

<p> statistically significant. In interpreting the small </p>

<p> magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to </p>

<p> drug use behavior, it is important to note that the </p>

<p> immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the </p>

<p> relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary </p>

<p> school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time </p>

<p> interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior </p>

<p> change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at </p>

<p> influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is </p>

<p> most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on </p>

<p> social skills because it is widely believed that children </p>

<p> with greater social competencies are more able to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate </p>

<p> impact on social skills. As described earlier, few </p>

<p> longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and </p>

<p> some have been compromised by contamination of the </p>

<p> control group. However, based on two experimental </p>

<p> studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years </p>

<p> after implementation is available, there is no evidence </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are </p>

<p> older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most </p>

<p> long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs </p>

<p> have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than </p>

<p> appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; </p>

<p> Murray et al., 1989). </p>

<p> Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue </p>

<p> to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social </p>

<p> skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators </p>

<p> should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless </p>

<p> tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine </p>

<p> coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants </p>

<p> and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be </p>

<p> monitored. It is also important to continue to measure </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as </p>

<p> social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence </p>

<p> drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to </p>

<p> specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of </p>

<p> the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a </p>

<p> variety of potentially important program effects other </p>

<p> than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about </p>

<p> the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences </p>

<p> drug use.=20 </p>

<p> For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that </p>

<p> effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results </p>

<p> to facilitate comparison both to the results of this </p>

<p> meta-analysis and those of future studies. As </p>

<p> demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, </p>

<p> so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. </p>

<p> When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies become available, they should be carefully </p>

<p> studied and compared with the results of the studies </p>

<p> reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic </p>

<p> reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing </p>

<p> review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the </p>

<p> curriculum might need modification. </p>

<p> How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth </p>

<p> in general? </p>

<p> The effect sizes discussed above indicate the </p>

<p> extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at </p>

<p> immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in </p>

<p> context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that </p>

<p> of other school-based drug use prevention programs to </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or </p>

<p> similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and </p>

<p> skills to average effect sizes calculated for other </p>

<p> methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those </p>

<p> for upper elementary school pupils to make the </p>

<p> comparisons most meaningful. </p>

<p> We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of </p>

<p> prevention programs, namely &quot;interactive&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;noninteractive&quot; programs (Tobler, in press,
1994).=20 </p>

<p> These two program categories cover most types of current </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 </p>

<p> Interactive programs generally are the same as the social </p>

<p> competence programs described in that chapter. These </p>

<p> programs represent the most recent advances in drug use </p>

<p> prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies </p>

<p> and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally include knowledge and affective </p>

<p> programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs </p>

<p> represent earlier approaches to drug education that </p>

<p> emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use </p>

<p> through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and </p>

<p> interactive programs. The original core curriculum was </p>

<p> developed when prevention efforts were in transition </p>

<p> between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective </p>

<p> education programs) and the emergence of interactive </p>

<p> programs (these emphasizing social influence). </p>

<p> Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were </p>

<p> greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average </p>

<p> effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes </p>

<p> for interactive programs. For drug use, the average </p>

<p> effect size for interactive programs was three times </p>

<p> greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social </p>

<p> skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for </p>

<p> attitudes, three times greater. </p>

<p> Interactive programs have been shown to be the most </p>

<p> promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally have been shown to be less effective </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares </p>

<p> features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, </p>

<p> it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we </p>

<p> reported should fall somewhere between. </p>

<p> In Chapter 7, we described several methodological </p>

<p> reasons that could help account for the differences in </p>

<p> effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the </p>

<p> interactive comparison programs. These included the </p>

<p> possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug </p>

<p> education programs, whereas the control groups for the </p>

<p> various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- </p>

<p> ity is that because the interactive programs were </p>

<p> primarily university research-based evaluation studies, </p>

<p> the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been </p>

<p> more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 </p>

<p> Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be </p>

<p> expected than in real-world conditions, such as those </p>

<p> surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors </p>

<p> that may have varied across the intervention programs and </p>

<p> associated evaluation studies that contributed to the </p>

<p> observed differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> substantial variation in characteristics of the studients </p>

<p> (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions </p>

<p> (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of </p>

<p> the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to </p>

<p> differences in program effects. Such possibilities could </p>

<p> not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 </p>

<p> Further testing is warranted when larger samples of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> It is also important to consider substantive </p>

<p> reasons that could account for the differences. Possible </p>

<p> explanations include the content of the original core </p>

<p> curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as </p>

<p> instructors, and the more didactic approach of the </p>

<p> instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations </p>

<p> suggests areas for future research and possibly for </p>

<p> programmatic change. </p>

<p> As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content </p>

<p> has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive </p>

<p> programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus </p>

<p> than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a </p>

<p> skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps </p>

<p> greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on </p>

<p> social influences, and less emphasis on affective </p>

<p> factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those </p>

<p> reported from interactive programs. However, it is </p>

<p> difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular </p>

<p> lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention </p>

<p> programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall </p>

<p> programs rather than of the various program components or </p>

<p> combinations of components. Future research in this area </p>

<p> might suggest particular curriculum changes. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area </p>

<p> of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer </p>

<p> performance compared with interactive programs. Although </p>

<p> instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than </p>

<p> other possible program providers. For example, despite </p>

<p> the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law </p>

<p> enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to </p>

<p> lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No </p>

<p> studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police </p>

<p> officer; examination of the results from such a study </p>

<p> might suggest whether police officers are as effective as </p>

<p> other possible instructors. </p>

<p> Regardless of the leader, however, the generally </p>

<p> more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not </p>

<p> been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching </p>

<p> mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional </p>

<p> didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering </p>

<p> information, with little response from students, are </p>

<p> increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective </p>

<p> are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with </p>

<p> the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or </p>

<p> participatory learning approaches in which the teacher </p>

<p> serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate </p>

<p> discussions and other interactions among students.=20 </p>

<p> Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil </p>

<p> interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily </p>

<p> on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of </p>

<p> lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer </p>

<p> and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not </p>

<p> curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the </p>

<p> interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on </p>

<p> such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ </p>

<p> more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on </p>

<p> how they can do so. </p>

<p> What are the intended and unintended consequences of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s approach to </p>

<p> drug abuse prevention? </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed examined </p>

<p> consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or </p>

<p> unintended, other than those related directly to the </p>

<p> curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be </p>

<p> envisioned. These include effects related to other </p>

<p> behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and </p>

<p> delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be </p>

<p> consequences related to the relationship that develops </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in </p>

<p> turn have positive consequences for police and community </p>

<p> relations in general. Research indicates that the </p>

<p> effects on police officers through their exposure to </p>

<p> students and the problems they face may also be </p>

<p> substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional </p>

<p> Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that </p>

<p> some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to </p>

<p> the relations between students and police officers. The </p>

<p> studies we reviewed provided little insight into these </p>

<p> areas. This suggests the importance of research to </p>

<p> explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach </p>

<p> to drug use prevention. </p>

<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> As might be expected of an institution as large as </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments </p>

<p> present an array of findings and raise a number of issues </p>

<p> deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization </p>

<p> and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most </p>

<p> prominently, the findings show a program that has been </p>

<p> extremely successful at placing drug education in our </p>

<p> Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in </p>

<p> the majority of school districts in the country and is </p>

<p> expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the </p>

<p> same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the </p>

<p> original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as </p>

<p> successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug </p>

<p> use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive </p>

<p> programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the </p>

<p> original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on </p>

<p> students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more </p>

<p> successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social </p>

<p> skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more </p>

<p> effective as a drug use prevention program. </p>

<p> Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing </p>

<p> the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through </p>

<p> building a complex and solid organizational structure </p>

<p> that reaches from local to national levels, by forging </p>

<p> close partnerships between education and law enforcement, </p>

<p> and by winning substantial community support for the </p>

<p> program. In no other program of this magnitude have </p>

<p> school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders </p>

<p> who lack traditional educational credentials to replace </p>

<p> teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These </p>

<p> resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move </p>

<p> forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug </p>

<p> use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, </p>

<p> we briefly recapitulate our major findings and </p>

<p> recommendations. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now </p>

<p> implemented in over half the school districts in the </p>

<p> country and is expected to grow substantially in the </p>

<p> coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and </p>

<p> rural school districts, we believe that ways for these </p>

<p> school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be </p>

<p> examined. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once </p>

<p> both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is </p>

<p> carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the </p>

<p> national, regional, and State levels, it is also very </p>

<p> much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local </p>

<p> initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At </p>

<p> the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient </p>

<p> resources be made available to support this burgeoning </p>

<p> organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, </p>

<p> technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, </p>

<p> we believe that alternative sources of support should be </p>

<p> explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as </p>

<p> possible from dependence on public funds. =20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law </p>

<p> enforcement's relationship with education is the </p>

<p> cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a </p>

<p> variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen </p>

<p> this critical partnership. This includes improving </p>

<p> methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as </p>

<p> well as increasing where possible the already </p>

<p> multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school </p>

<p> life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation </p>

<p> on advisory boards by staff of departments of education </p>

<p> at the State and national levels. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence </p>

<p> of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is </p>

<p> fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's </p>

<p> attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, </p>

<p> the parents, and the community as very supportive. The </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the </p>

<p> program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects </p>

<p> on students were rated as very satisfactory. This </p>

<p> persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications </p>

<p> and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum </p>

<p> and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization </p>

<p> and structure at the local level is sound and should be </p>

<p> preserved. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> positive effects on students are generally not supported </p>

<p> by the results of the methodologically sound short-term </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we </p>

<p> summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated </p>

<p> somewhat greater effects than those of didactic </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention methods that are based on </p>

<p> affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than </p>

<p> those of interactive methods that use social influence </p>

<p> approaches. </p>

<p> Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many </p>

<p> interactive features, we believe that appropriate </p>

<p> modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and </p>

<p> to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the </p>

<p> context of the institution as a whole. These </p>

<p> modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every </p>

<p> 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of </p>

<p> drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.
inparticular. We comm= </p>

<p> end </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for convening a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug </p>

<p> prevention specialists who will review relevant drug </p>

<p> prevention research findings and make recommendations </p>

<p> concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution </p>

<p> that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a </p>

<p> partnership between law enforcement and education that </p>

<p> has the substantial support of children, parents, and the </p>

<p> community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this </p>

<p> highly visible profile come high expectations. Our </p>

<p> report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of </p>

<p> these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 </p>

<p> Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful </p>

<p> monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, </p>

<p> coupled with the willingness to make and assess </p>

<p> modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by </p>

<p> the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core </p>

<p> curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 </p>

<p> Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its </p>

<p> continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities </p>

<p> of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, </p>

<p> we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its </p>

<p> partnerships with individuals and institutions outside </p>

<p> its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of </p>

<p> those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who </p>

<p> are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance </p>

<p> the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe </p>

<p> these efforts will result in a program that maintains its </p>

<p> unique identity and place in drug education, while </p>

<p> meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug </p>

<p> use among youth. </p>

<p> Appendix B </p>

<p> Individual Study Descriptions </p>

<p> Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorous
studies </p>

<p> selected for the meta-analysis are given below in </p>

<p> alphabetical order by the location of the study. The </p>

<p> research design, sample size and characteristics, and </p>

<p> results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, </p>

<p> social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and </p>

<p> drug use behavior are reported. Additional information </p>

<p> and greater detail about the study methodologies and </p>

<p> results are available in the reports or papers issued by </p>

<p> each study. </p>

<p> 1.British Columbia </p>

<p> The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)
used a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were </p>

<p> assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with </p>

<p> similar demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered an </p>

<p> anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed </p>

<p> pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all </p>

<p> outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on </p>

<p> outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the </p>

<p> aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, </p>

<p> and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on </p>

<p> the ethnic composition of the sample. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, </p>

<p> beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, </p>

<p> uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and </p>

<p> PCP). </p>

<p> 2. Hawaii </p>

<p> The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &amp;
Tanji, 1986) </p>

<p> used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 </p>

<p> schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison </p>

<p> conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the </p>

<p> comparison condition; data from these comparison </p>

<p> classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils </p>

<p> (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the </p>

<p> ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not </p>

<p> analyzed but was approximately 6%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on one social skills </p>

<p> indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on another </p>

<p> social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use. </p>

<p> 3. Illinois-C </p>

<p> The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, </p>

<p> Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, &amp; Bailey, 1994) used both </p>

<p> an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs </p>

<p> of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 </p>

<p> pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom </p>

<p> procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan </p>

<p> status, ethnic composition, number of students with </p>

<p> English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- </p>

<p> income families; administered a pretest and three </p>

<p> posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after </p>

<p> implementation); matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; adjusted for school </p>

<p> effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed </p>

<p> attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were </p>

<p> fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% </p>

<p> were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or &quot;other.&quot; The attrition
rate </p>

<p> over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ </p>

<p> across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of </p>

<p> cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have </p>

<p> statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence </p>

<p> on smoking and beer drinking); social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug </p>

<p> use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy </p>

<p> drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or </p>

<p> quitting alcohol). </p>

<p> 4. Kentucky-A </p>

<p> The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,
Day, </p>

<p> &amp; Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, &amp; Walden,
1991b) </p>

<p> used an experimental design employing random assignment </p>

<p> of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and three posttests </p>

<p> (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and initial nonequivalence between the </p>

<p> comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at </p>

<p> pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 </p>

<p> The attrition rate over the three posttests was </p>

<p> approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental </p>

<p> conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about </p>

<p> drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative </p>

<p> attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects </p>

<p> at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about </p>

<p> alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- </p>

<p> esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, </p>

<p> and marijuana). </p>

<p> 5. Kentucky-B </p>

<p> The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine &amp; Bohlander
1988, </p>

<p> 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, </p>

<p> suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among </p>

<p> schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a </p>

<p> later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and two posttests </p>

<p> (immediately and one year after implementation); matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and type of school. The sample in the first </p>

<p> year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics were not given. Attrition information </p>

<p> was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had </p>

<p> received the D.A.R.E. program. </p>

<p> The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude </p>

<p> toward police. </p>

<p> 6. Minnesota </p>

<p> The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &amp;
McCormick, </p>

<p> 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; </p>

<p> random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who </p>

<p> would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed </p>

<p> intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected </p>

<p> demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values </p>

<p> on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth </p>

<p> graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were </p>

<p> white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% </p>

<p> Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on </p>

<p> the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug </p>

<p> use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> 7. North Carolina </p>

<p> The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,
&amp; </p>

<p> Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design </p>

<p> employing random assignment of 20 schools to either </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a </p>

<p> pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from </p>

<p> pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for </p>

<p> pretest values on outcome variables and initial </p>

<p> nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted </p>

<p> for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were </p>

<p> African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude </p>

<p> toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of </p>

<p> beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior </p>

<p> (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). </p>

<p> 8. South Carolina </p>

<p> The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) used
a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental research design in which five schools </p>

<p> were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched </p>

<p> on demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered a pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 </p>

<p> The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The </p>

<p> attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% </p>

<p> in the comparison groups. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and </p>

<p> initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on subjects' </p>

<p> self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use </p>

<p> behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana </p>

<p> use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana </p>

<p> use). </p>

<p> RESEARCH IN BRIEF </p>

<p> NOVEMBER 1993 </p>

<p> PREVENTING ILLEGAL DIVERSION OF CHEMICALS: </p>

<p> A MODEL STATUTE </p>

<p> BY SHERRY GREEN </p>

<p> Letter from Michael J. Russell, Acting Director, National
Institute of </p>

<p> Justice: </p>

<p> Chemicals diverted from legitimate commerce are used in the
production of </p>

<p> illicit drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, PCP,
and LSD. </p>

<p> Controlling illegal diversion and use of such chemicals is
essential to </p>

<p> limiting illicit drug production. Recent efforts to address
this problem are </p>

<p> based on the belief that illicit drug production can be
traced from the </p>

<p> records of chemical manufacturers and dealers of raw
materials in the same </p>

<p> way that laundered money can be traced through financial
records. </p>

<p> The principal U.S. statute to control chemical diversion is
the Chemical </p>

<p> Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, which established
record keeping </p>

<p> requirements and enforcement activities, initially for 20
chemicals. </p>

<p> The Act has already proven effective in limiting the
international illicit </p>

<p> diversion of the identified chemicals and controlling some
domestic </p>

<p> manufacturing. However, illicit drug production in the United
States has been </p>

<p> rising at an alarming rate, with illegal domestic
laboratories now capable of </p>

<p> producing enough stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and
narcotics to </p>

<p> satisfy demand for these substances. </p>

<p> Adequate record-keeping ensures that there are paper trails
on chemicals sent </p>

<p> to illegal laboratories that make drugs. Thirty-two States,
however, do not </p>

<p> require record-keeping of transactions involving chemicals
identified as </p>

<p> necessary for producing illegal drugs. Criminals camouflage
diversion of </p>

<p> chemicals by moving shipments through States without
record-keeping </p>

<p> requirements. </p>

<p> To focus attention on the need for all State law enforcement
agencies to </p>

<p> supplement Federal controls over chemical traffic and its
diversion into </p>

<p> illicit drug manufacturing, the National Institute of Justice
sponsored a </p>

<p> project to create a Model State Chemical Control Act. The
Model Act seeks to </p>

<p> balance and accommodate the interests of law enforcement and
legitimate </p>

<p> commerce. This Research in Brief explains how the Model Act
can be used to </p>

<p> help halt the growth of illegal domestic drug manufacturing
by stopping the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals from legitimate to illegitimate
purposes. </p>

<p> [End letter] </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies around the world are using a variety
of methods to </p>

<p> attack the illegal and deadly &quot;industry&quot; of illicit
drugs. Enforcement </p>

<p> officials seize contraband substances, break up distribution
networks, </p>

<p> disrupt money-laundering operations, and destroy crops. A
critical part of </p>

<p> this multifaceted attack on drug trafficking is the control
of specific </p>

<p> chemicals that are necessary to produce illegal drugs. </p>

<p> The United States is one of the world's leading producers and
distributors of </p>

<p> the chemicals that are used to make controlled substances.
Each year our </p>

<p> Nation exports more than 50,000 metric tons of chemicals to
Latin America, </p>

<p> many of which find their way into the clandestine
laboratories of cocaine- </p>

<p> and heroin-producing countries. In fact, seizures of illegal
labs in Colombia </p>

<p> and other Latin American countries often uncover chemical
containers with US. </p>

<p> company logos. Until 1989 much of the cocaine entering our
country was </p>

<p> produced using chemicals originating in the United States. </p>

<p> Although there has been a decline in the export of chemicals
for </p>

<p> manufacturing illegal drugs, there has been an increase in
the chemicals' </p>

<p> distribution at home. Illegal domestic laboratories are now
capable of </p>

<p> producing enough illicit drugs to satisfy U.S. consumers'
demand. </p>

<p> In 1991 the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) supported a
project to help </p>

<p> the States develop a legislative response to the problem of
distribution of </p>

<p> chemicals and their manufacture into illegal drugs. To
prepare the Model </p>

<p> State Chemical Control Act of 1992 (the Model), the American
Prosecutors </p>

<p> Research Institute (APRI), the research arm of the National
District </p>

<p> Attorneys Association, brought together investigators and
prosecutors from </p>

<p> Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington State.
In addition, APRI </p>

<p> solicited comments from the Department of Justice and the
Drug Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration (DEA) on the lessons they had learned at the
Federal level and </p>

<p> sought to understand the concerns of the chemical and
pharmaceutical </p>

<p> industries. </p>

<p> This Research in Brief describes how chemicals are used to
make illicit </p>

<p> drugs, discusses existing Federal and State legislation to
curtail the </p>

<p> diversion of chemicals for illicit drug production, and
reviews the Model </p>

<p> statute. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCTION </p>

<p> --Essential and precursor chemicals: All major illicit drugs
except marijuana </p>

<p> are either extracted or synthesized in a process requiring
chemicals that are </p>

<p> categorized as either &quot;essential&quot; or
&quot;precursor.&quot; Essential chemicals are </p>

<p> used to extract drugs, such as cocaine, from plants. Although
these chemicals </p>

<p> do not become part of the drug's molecular structure, they
are crucial to the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Precursor chemicals are used to
synthesize drugs (such </p>

<p> as PCP), which are not naturally derived. These chemicals do
become part of </p>

<p> the drug's molecular structure. </p>

<p> --Clandestine Labs: Highly sophisticated laboratory
operations are sometimes </p>

<p> necessary to manufacture drugs. For example, producing
marketable quantities </p>

<p> of cocaine requires large-scale operations to handle the
enormous amounts of </p>

<p> coca leaves and solvents required. On the other hand, illegal
drug production </p>

<p> is often a simple process, without need of complex
technology, sophisticated </p>

<p> education, or training. Many synthetic drugs such as
methamphetamine and PCP </p>

<p> can be produced in someone's home with readily available
laboratory </p>

<p> equipment. In fact, with equipment and precursor chemicals
worth $200, a </p>

<p> criminal can in 18 hours produce a batch of methamphetamine
with a street </p>

<p> value of $98,000.(ref. 1) </p>

<p> In the 1980's States faced an outbreak of clandestine
laboratories because </p>

<p> chemicals were readily available on the open market or were
easily diverted </p>

<p> from legitimate commerce. In 1986 the Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics (OBN) </p>

<p> seized 28 labs, an almost 100 percent increase over the 16
labs seized in </p>

<p> 1985. Another 100 percent increase in seizures occurred in
1988 when OBN </p>

<p> seized 62 laboratories, compared to the 30 labs seized the
previous year. </p>

<p> From 1985 to 1987, Texas narcotics officers seized more than
twice the number </p>

<p> of labs as OBN. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories range from small crude operations in
sheds, </p>

<p> bathtubs, mobile homes, boats, and motel rooms to highly
sophisticated </p>

<p> operations with professional quality laboratory glassware and
equipment. </p>

<p> More than 80 percent of the clandestine labs in the United
States produce </p>

<p> methamphetamines.(ref. 2) With a knowledge of chemistry
equivalent to that </p>

<p> learned in high school, illicit lab operators are believed to
produce 25 tons </p>

<p> of methamphetamines annually with a street value of $3
billion. Less than 1 </p>

<p> percent of that amount is spent on the chemicals needed for
production.(ref. </p>

<p> 3) </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION AND TRAFFICKING ACT </p>

<p> In 1988 Congress enacted the Chemical Diversion and
Trafficking Act (CDTA), </p>

<p> Subtitle A of the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendments of 1988
(codified as amendments </p>

<p> to the Federal Controlled Substances Act). CDTA established
record-keeping </p>

<p> and reporting requirements and authorized enforcement
activities for domestic </p>

<p> and international transactions in designated precursor and
essential </p>

<p> chemicals. Originally CDTA regulated machines for making the
drugs into </p>

<p> tablets or capsules, 12 precursor chemicals, and 8 essential
chemicals. Now, </p>

<p> 27 precursor and 7 essential chemicals are on the CDTA list.
Chemicals may be </p>

<p> added or deleted under standard Federal rule making
procedures. </p>

<p> CDTA applies to any individual or legal entity that
manufactures, distributes </p>

<p> domestically, imports, or exports any of the listed
chemicals. The Act makes </p>

<p> the unauthorized trade in these listed chemicals equivalent
to trafficking in </p>

<p> illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Each chemical has been assigned a threshold amount, by volume
or weight, or a </p>

<p> threshold number of monthly transactions. Once the threshold
has been reached </p>

<p> or exceeded, regulated individuals and entities must comply
with Federal </p>

<p> record-keeping, reporting, and identification requirements.
However, </p>

<p> threshold quantities do not apply to machinery; distribution
of a single </p>

<p> tableting or encapsulating machine triggers CDTA provisions. </p>

<p> Among the provisions are requirements that purchasers supply
proof of </p>

<p> identity in all regulated transactions. The type of
identification required </p>

<p> depends on whether the customer is new, is an individual or
established </p>

<p> business, is paying in cash, or is exporting the chemical to
another country. </p>

<p> Records of regulated domestic transactions involving a
precursor chemical or </p>

<p> a tableting or encapsulating machine must be kept for 4
years. For an </p>

<p> essential chemical, the record must be kept 2 years. Records
must be readily </p>

<p> retrievable either at the business where the transaction
occurred or some </p>

<p> other central location. Each record must contain specific
information about </p>

<p> the transaction and is subject to inspection and photocopying
by the Drug </p>

<p> Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p> CDTA requires that regulated individuals and entities report
some </p>

<p> circumstances both orally and in writing to DEA. These
include uncommon </p>

<p> methods of payment, loss or disappearance of a chemical, and
suspicion that a </p>

<p> chemical has been diverted for illegal purposes. As with
records, reports </p>

<p> must contain the date of the transaction, quantity of the
chemical purchased, </p>

<p> name and address of each party, method of transfer, and other
descriptive </p>

<p> details. On the basis of the reports or a lapse in
record-keeping, DEA has </p>

<p> the authority to stop chemical shipments. Receipt of the
required advance </p>

<p> notice of shipments can trigger DEA suspension when an
illicit transfer is </p>

<p> suspected. </p>

<p> --The effect of Federal control: Shortly after implementation
of CDTA, DEA </p>

<p> noted a downward trend in domestic illegal lab activity as
measured by the </p>

<p> number of lab seizures. Of the 1,000 projected DEA lab
seizures for 1989, 807 </p>

<p> materialized. A sharper decline occurred the following year
when DEA seized </p>

<p> 521 laboratories. This decline was the first time seizures
had dropped </p>

<p> significantly since 1981. </p>

<p> CDTA has also been successful in controlling exports of
essential chemicals </p>

<p> to Latin America. But as the pathways to foreign buyers have
narrowed, some </p>

<p> U.S. exporters have turned their attention to the domestic
market. </p>

<p> Opportunities for diversion exist all along the domestic
commercial chain. </p>

<p> Although CDTA's strict requirements help safeguard the legal
transfer of </p>

<p> chemicals above the threshold levels, illicit operators are
restructuring </p>

<p> their businesses to avoid Federal regulations. They are
focusing their </p>

<p> efforts on States that do not have effective mechanisms for
controlling </p>

<p> chemicals. </p>

<p> --Closing the door: The Office of National Drug Control
Policy has estimated </p>

<p> that the world supply of cocaine in 1990 was 1,000 metric
tons, or about 2.2 </p>

<p> million pounds. To produce this amount of cocaine, millions
of pounds of </p>

<p> essential chemicals were required for processing. But many of
these chemicals </p>

<p> such as hydrochloric acid also have hundreds of legitimate
uses, and for this </p>

<p> reason, they are common substances in international trade. </p>

<p> Criminals obtain these substances from manufacturers through
theft, bribery </p>

<p> of employees, or even legal purchase, especially in areas
that lack chemical </p>

<p> control laws or do not enforce them. Poor plant security can
increase theft, </p>

<p> and some retail purchasers are actually &quot;front
companies&quot; set up by producers </p>

<p> to disguise the illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> In addition, the vast international network of freight
forwarders, brokers, </p>

<p> and agents provides access to chemicals through multiple
sales transactions, </p>

<p> similar to money-laundering operations. In ports and free
trade zones, </p>

<p> criminals can obtain the desired chemicals by repacking or
re-labeling </p>

<p> materials. </p>

<p> CDTA has greatly decreased U.S. exports of essential
chemicals to Latin </p>

<p> America. This Federal statute has added to costs borne by
criminals, and the </p>

<p> new regulation and record-keeping requirements of the Act
make it </p>

<p> increasingly likely that illicit operators are restructuring
their businesses </p>

<p> to avoid Federal regulations. They are focusing their efforts
on States that </p>

<p> do not have effective mechanisms for controlling chemicals. </p>

<p> THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> State regulatory and enforcement efforts are needed to
supplement Federal </p>

<p> controls over the movement of chemicals into illegal
channels. If State </p>

<p> officials can follow the trail of precursor and essential
chemicals from the </p>

<p> chemical manufacturer to the illicit drug producer, then
producers can be </p>

<p> identified and apprehended before they manufacture illegal
drugs. Controlling </p>

<p> these chemicals, therefore, is a potent strategy that can
help identify drug </p>

<p> criminals and interfere with their operations. </p>

<p> Effective regulation of chemical transactions could dry up
the sources that </p>

<p> supply illegal labs. However, clandestine drug production is
a nomadic </p>

<p> business. When chemicals become difficult to obtain in one
locale, illegal </p>

<p> lab operators simply move their operations to a location
where acquisition of </p>

<p> chemicals is less complicated. Differences in the extent of
control exercised </p>

<p> by the States currently make that a fairly easy process. More
consistent </p>

<p> State laws could curtail movement of illegal labs from State
to State. </p>

<p> EXISTING VARIATIONS IN STATE CONTROLS </p>

<p> To date 18 States have sought to control the existence of
clandestine labs by </p>

<p> enacting their own detailed chemical tracking requirements.
Some </p>

<p> jurisdictions have incorporated these requirements into their
controlled </p>

<p> substances acts already on the books, while others have
adopted new, distinct </p>

<p> statutes. </p>

<p> --Number of chemicals: Colorado controls the largest number
of chemicals (35) </p>

<p> while Montana regulates 9. The differences reflect each
State's experience or </p>

<p> policy regarding diversion, abuse, and the potential illicit
use of a </p>

<p> chemical. Nearly all of the States that have controls exclude
prescription or </p>

<p> over-the-counter drugs, or both, from chemical requirements,
with special </p>

<p> exemptions for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine,
norpseudoephedrine, and </p>

<p> phenylpropanolamine. </p>

<p> --Registration: All 18 States require a license or permit to
lawfully </p>

<p> manufacture or transfer a regulated chemical. Only a few
regulate the </p>

<p> purchase or possession of chemicals. Registration renewal
generally happens </p>

<p> annually and involves a reasonable fee; the definition of
reasonable varies </p>

<p> from a maximum of $25 in Arkansas to a minimum of $250 in New
Mexico. Grounds </p>

<p> for denial, suspension, or revocation include fraud; drug law
violations and </p>

<p> convictions; and denial, suspension, or revocation of Federal
registrations. </p>

<p> --Record-keeping: Differences also occur in the requirements
for </p>

<p> record-keeping. For example, several jurisdictions mandate
that chemical </p>

<p> transfer records be kept for 2 years after the transaction
date, but </p>

<p> Minnesota requires that records be kept for 5 years. Texas
requires that </p>

<p> records of sales of laboratory apparatus also be kept. Hawaii
and Missouri </p>

<p> maintain the confidentiality of information obtained through
records. </p>

<p> Pennsylvania penalizes wrongful use of the information. </p>

<p> --Reporting: Required reporting of intrastate transfers and
out-of-State </p>

<p> purchases also varies among States. In several States the
regulatory agency </p>

<p> must be given 21 days advance notice of any chemical
delivery. Some States </p>

<p> provide a monthly reporting alternative for individuals and
entities with a </p>

<p> history of lawful use, a regular relationship with a
recipient, or both. </p>

<p> While California and Montana require notice of receipt of
chemicals within 3 </p>

<p> days after delivery, Oregon allows 10 days. Ten States
require that special </p>

<p> reports be submitted within 3 days after discovery of a theft
or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals, and eight require reports within 3 days for a
discrepancy in </p>

<p> quantities shipped and received. Iowa and Washington extend
these deadlines </p>

<p> to 7 days. </p>

<p> --Exemptions: Medical professionals, agents, and licensed
entities such as </p>

<p> common carriers are traditionally exempt from licensing or
reporting </p>

<p> obligations. Some States expand the exemptions to include
college chemistry </p>

<p> students, government employees, or researchers. </p>

<p> --Purchaser identification: Most jurisdictions mandate that
individual </p>

<p> purchasers identify themselves with a photograph, proof of
street or </p>

<p> residential mailing address, and signature. Some
jurisdictions ask for the </p>

<p> purchaser's birth date, driver's license or other
State-issued identification </p>

<p> number, year in which the purchaser's vehicle was
manufactured, and vehicle </p>

<p> license tag number. Most business recipients must furnish an
authorization </p>

<p> letter listing an identification number, an address, a phone
number, and a </p>

<p> description of the chemical's intended use. </p>

<p> --Responsibility: Finally, there is no consensus among the
States on which </p>

<p> government agency should be given regulatory responsibility.
The 18 States </p>

<p> assign this duty to a wide variety of health, pharmaceutical,
commerce, and </p>

<p> enforcement agencies. </p>

<p> ILLEGITIMATE USES FOR LEGITIMATE PRODUCTS </p>

<p> Many people recognize ephedrine as an ingredient in sinus
medications. </p>

<p> However, consumers are often unaware that ephedrine is also
the primary </p>

<p> precursor used to illegally produce methamphetamine (meth).
In 1990, 53 </p>

<p> percent of the clandestine meth labs seized by the Drug
Enforcement </p>

<p> Administration used the ephedrine reduction method to produce
the drug.(ref. </p>

<p> 4) </p>

<p> State officials report that illicit meth laboratories in the
West and </p>

<p> Southwest began using ephedrine after phenylacetic acid came
under State </p>

<p> regulation. In northern California 85 percent of the seized
meth labs used </p>

<p> single-ingredient ephedrine tablets. In Oregon officials
discovered that </p>

<p> over-the-counter ephedrine tablets sold in the Portland area
had become a </p>

<p> source of ephedrine for northwest meth lab operators.(ref. 5)
</p>

<p> For this reason, ephedrine has been included in the list of
chemicals </p>

<p> targeted for regulation under the Model State Chemical
Control Act. </p>

<p> MODEL STATE CHEMICAL CONTROL ACT </p>

<p> In developing the Model State Chemical Control Act of 1992,
the drafters </p>

<p> sought to close loopholes in existing Federal and State
legislation and to </p>

<p> foster greater consistency among State regulations. Unlike
most criminal </p>

<p> laws, the Model is a preventive measure. Its goal is to stop
drug offenses </p>

<p> before they occur by preventing precursor and essential
chemicals from being </p>

<p> diverted to illegal channels. It seeks to protect the
interests of legitimate </p>

<p> commerce without limiting the ability of law enforcement to
stop illicit </p>

<p> chemical transactions. </p>

<p> Monitoring every transaction involving a regulated chemical.
The Model </p>

<p> creates a monitoring system that tracks 35 chemicals from
source to use. It </p>

<p> covers a comprehensive range of chemicals controlled by
States and the </p>

<p> Federal Government. </p>

<p> The Model's reporting and record-keeping requirements apply
to every </p>

<p> transaction involving a regulated chemical, not just those
exceeding a legal </p>

<p> threshold. Under Federal law, manufacturers and distributors
do not have to </p>

<p> report or keep records on individuals or businesses who buy
chemicals in </p>

<p> amounts below the legal threshold. Individuals can circumvent
the law by </p>

<p> making multiple purchases of small quantities, thereby
accumulating large </p>

<p> amounts of chemicals for clandestine production.
Unfortunately, Federal </p>

<p> officials have no way of obtaining information about such
transactions. The </p>

<p> Model permits State and local officials to address this type
of diversion </p>

<p> activity, which would otherwise escape detection until after
illegal use of </p>

<p> the chemicals. </p>

<p> The list of regulated chemicals can be modified by rule in
response to </p>

<p> changes in diversion or use. Under the Model, State officials
may regulate a </p>

<p> chemical on an emergency basis while awaiting completion of
normal </p>

<p> rule-making procedures. </p>

<p> Emergency regulation is sometimes necessary to prevent
imminent hazards to </p>

<p> public health and safety. Some chemicals are flammable or
toxic and their use </p>

<p> must be controlled as soon as possible to prevent explosions,
environmental </p>

<p> damage, or illness. </p>

<p> Registering manufacturers and distributors. Responsibility
for the control of </p>

<p> regulated chemicals rests primarily with manufacturers and
distributors. </p>

<p> Therefore, the Model requires that they annually furnish law
enforcement with </p>

<p> detailed information about the sources, location, and amount
of chemicals </p>

<p> available for sale. The purpose of annual registration is
threefold: </p>

<p> --To convey to manufacturers and distributors an
understanding of the </p>

<p> critical role they play in eliminating illegal chemical
transfers. </p>

<p> --To help government officials determine if the chemicals
found at </p>

<p> clandestine lab sites have been supplied by a legal or
&quot;underground&quot; source. </p>

<p> --To help government officials more accurately assess the
extent of illegal </p>

<p> diversion. </p>

<p> The drafters anticipate that the number of annual
registrations to be </p>

<p> processed will be manageable. For example, in California
officials currently </p>

<p> register only 40 to 45 companies per year. </p>

<p> Requiring permits to possess a regulated chemical. Permits
identify which </p>

<p> persons intend to use specific quantities of chemicals for a
specific </p>

<p> purpose. </p>

<p> With certain exceptions, every applicant for a permit must
provide detailed </p>

<p> personal information, including a criminal history and
notarized fingerprint </p>

<p> card. Based on this information, government officials
ascertain the fitness </p>

<p> of a potential chemical recipient and ensure that the
intended use is lawful. </p>

<p> The permit provision is modeled after Oklahoma's chemical
control statute, </p>

<p> which extends the law beyond the traditional
&quot;receiving&quot; category of </p>

<p> purchasers to individuals who want to &quot;possess&quot; a
regulated chemical. By </p>

<p> requiring that they obtain a permit each time they seek to
possess a </p>

<p> regulated chemical, the Model eliminates a significant
loophole in many </p>

<p> existing statutes. For example, some illegal
&quot;cookers&quot; manufacture controlled </p>

<p> substances using chemicals produced in their own clandestine
laboratories. </p>

<p> They are not subject to existing regulation and liability
provisions, which </p>

<p> apply solely to purchasers, because they do not buy the
chemical from an </p>

<p> outside source. Under the Model statute, &quot;cookers&quot;
would be subject to the </p>

<p> law because although they do not &quot;receive&quot; the
chemicals, they nonetheless </p>

<p> &quot;possess&quot; them. </p>

<p> The Model's permit process protects legitimate commerce in
two ways. First, </p>

<p> it exempts the owners and officers of publicly held
corporations (those with </p>

<p> 35 shareholders or more) from the disclosure requirements of
permit </p>

<p> applications. These corporations are often fairly sizable
businesses or are </p>

<p> headquartered out-of-State. Their shareholders and officers
lack the personal </p>

<p> access necessary to illegally use or transfer regulated
chemicals. The Model </p>

<p> assumes that there is no need for detailed background
information or </p>

<p> fingerprint cards for such persons. </p>

<p> Second, the Model includes a reporting alternative for
possessors who </p>

<p> demonstrate a history of regular, legitimate use. The risk of
these </p>

<p> possessors diverting chemicals for unlawful purposes is less
than with other </p>

<p> possessors. Therefore, they may submit retrospective monthly
reports of </p>

<p> actual chemical use in lieu of obtaining permits. The Model
prevents </p>

<p> unnecessary duplication by accepting copies of Federal
reports containing </p>

<p> information about threshold amounts of regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> --Exempting individuals from regulation: The Model exempts
common carriers </p>

<p> pharmacists, physicians, and other authorized practitioners
from the </p>

<p> statute's requirements. Manufacturers can obtain a special
exemption to </p>

<p> continue marketing bona fide drug products such as over-the
counter sinus and </p>

<p> asthma medications. A special exemption is granted upon a
finding by State </p>

<p> officials that a product is manufactured and distributed in a
manner that </p>

<p> prevents its diversion. In making the finding, State
officials consider the </p>

<p> product's packaging, advertising, and actual or potential for
diversion.(ref. </p>

<p> 6) </p>

<p> --Safeguarding possession of regulated chemicals: The Model
contains a number </p>

<p> of safeguards to prevent unauthorized or unscrupulous persons
from gaining </p>

<p> access to regulated chemicals. It specifies that the
following persons are </p>

<p> ineligible to apply for a registration or permit: </p>

<p> Convicted drug offenders. </p>

<p> Persons who have had a prior registration or permit </p>

<p> Minors </p>

<p> Because juveniles are subject to milder penalties than
adults, they </p>

<p> frequently have been recruited to become participants in
criminal activity. </p>

<p> Therefore, making minors ineligible should preclude drug
balers from using </p>

<p> juveniles to acquire chemicals for illegal purposes. </p>

<p> The Model also provides for denial, suspension, or revocation
of a </p>

<p> registration or permit. Violation of the statutory rules,
falsification of a </p>

<p> document, and similar acts are grounds for denial of
authorized access to </p>

<p> regulated chemicals. </p>

<p> Spotting discrepancies in the flow of chemicals. The Model
establishes four </p>

<p> information-gathering mechanisms to help State officials spot
possible </p>

<p> diversion activities. </p>

<p> First, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors, and
possessors to </p>

<p> report any suspicious transaction or circumstance. cash
payments, </p>

<p> discrepancies between quantities shipped and received, and
theft or loss of </p>

<p> chemicals are all examples of suspicious circumstances. </p>

<p> Second, the Model requires manufacturers, distributors,
brokers, and traders </p>

<p> to provide monthly reports detailing every transaction
involving a regulated </p>

<p> chemical. The reports allow officials to identify the true
purchaser of </p>

<p> chemicals and ascertain whether the actual chemical use is
consistent with </p>

<p> the stated intended use. </p>

<p> Third, the Model requires purchasers to submit information
about themselves, </p>

<p> their permit or other authorization, and their vehicles prior
to receiving or </p>

<p> distributing a regulated chemical. This provision, which
incorporates </p>

<p> California's purchaser identification requirements, also
facilitates </p>

<p> determination of the ultimate purchaser and the chemical's
use. </p>

<p> Fourth, manufacturers and distributors are required to take
inventory </p>

<p> annually and to keep all transaction records readily
accessible for 4 years. </p>

<p> --Providing for enforcement: The Model vests State officials
with the </p>

<p> authority to identify and respond to situations of
noncompliance. It </p>

<p> authorizes limited warrantless inspections during regular
business hours and </p>

<p> allows State officials to routinely inspect inventories,
storage facilities, </p>

<p> records, papers, files, and equipment.(ref. 9) It also grants
State officials </p>

<p> the power to subpoena witnesses and require document
production. The Model </p>

<p> provides for stiff fines and terms of imprisonment for
noncompliance. </p>

<p> To eliminate the economic incentive for this type of criminal
activity, the </p>

<p> Model applies a State's drug forfeiture procedures to money
and property used </p>

<p> in violation of the chemical diversion statute. </p>

<p> --Recovering expenses: As with any proactive regulatory
scheme, the Model </p>

<p> requires a continuing investment of time and money. To
prevent financial </p>

<p> strain on scarce State resources, a system of nonrefundable
application fees </p>

<p> is recommended to help offset the cost of administering the
program. </p>

<p> In addition, the Model imposes a special civil assessment on
violators of the </p>

<p> statute to be used for cleanup of illegal laboratory sites.
Seizure of </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories often reveals significant amounts of
hazardous or </p>

<p> toxic waste and other byproducts that have been found. Under
Federal law, law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies become liable for various cleanup and
transporting </p>

<p> operations, damage to natural resources, and subsequent
health risks that </p>

<p> remain after the lab is dismantled.(ref. 10) </p>

<p> Last year Oklahoma spent approximately $6,000 to clean up
illegal labs, and </p>

<p> for several years California has spent more than $1 million a
year for </p>

<p> similar tasks. However, these expenses were only for removing
bulk </p>

<p> contamination. In the future site restoration through
hazardous waste removal </p>

<p> may require even larger sums of money. The civil assessment
will prevent </p>

<p> violators from escaping financial liability for the
environmental damage they </p>

<p> cause and help States address the issue of long-term
hazardous waste or </p>

<p> residual contamination. </p>

<p> APPLYING THE MODEL </p>

<p> The chemical control legislation in California, Oklahoma,
Texas, and </p>

<p> Washington served as guides for creating the Model. Oklahoma
and Texas </p>

<p> officials have already noted the positive effect of their
legislation on the </p>

<p> struggle to eliminate illegal drug production. The Oklahoma
Bureau of </p>

<p> Narcotics and Texas Department of Public Safety indicate that
their States' </p>

<p> precursor laws significantly reduced the availability of
chemicals throughout </p>

<p> Oklahoma and Texas. The reduction in supply has led to a
decrease in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratory activity in both States. The Texas
Department of </p>

<p> Public Safety reports that the availability of illicit
amphetamine and </p>

<p> methamphetamine in Texas decreased about 50 percent during
the 3-year period </p>

<p> since passage of its statute.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite the success of these States' efforts, the lack of
adequate chemical </p>

<p> controls in many states provides illegal drug manufacturers
with </p>

<p> opportunities to expand their production of controlled
substances. The toll </p>

<p> in health, welfare, enforcement, and safety costs as well as
human suffering </p>

<p> is incalculable. The Model is designed to help State
policymakers and </p>

<p> criminal justice professionals develop legislation that will
severely curtail </p>

<p> domestic illegal drug production while protecting legitimate
commercial </p>

<p> interests. </p>

<p> COPING WITH CHEMICAL HAZARDS </p>

<p> Seizures of clandestine labs pose special problems for law
enforcement </p>

<p> officers because many of the chemicals used in drug
manufacturing are </p>

<p> dangerous. For example, acids and solvents are corrosive and
flammable, and </p>

<p> some are highly explosive. About one-fifth of clandestine lab
seizures result </p>

<p> from reports of fires caused by chemical processes.(ref. 7) </p>

<p> In addition, many precursor and essential chemicals are
corrosive and can </p>

<p> cause lung and eye damage, even upon exposure to vapors
emanating from the </p>

<p> lab. Furthermore, according to a study in California,
one-tenth of seized </p>

<p> labs were booby-trapped with explosives or with disfiguring
and poisonous </p>

<p> chemical devices.(ref. 8) </p>

<p> For these reasons, law enforcement experts recommend that
police officers in </p>

<p> all areas of the criminal justice system be given special
training in </p>

<p> handling these substances. They note that rural police
agencies are just as </p>

<p> likely to encounter clandestine labs as urban police. Highway
patrols and </p>

<p> other agencies in jurisdictions with large railroad and other
transportation </p>

<p> hubs are likely to find such substances en route to a
clandestine location. </p>

<p> This briefing report provides information on drug courts,\1 a
new </p>

<p> approach used by state and local governments to address
drug-related </p>

<p> crime. These courts monitor the treatment and behavior of
drug-using </p>

<p> defendants. </p>

<p> Title V of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994 </p>

<p> (the 1994 Crime Act) authorizes the award of federal grants
for drug </p>

<p> courts. The act requires that we assess the effectiveness and
impact </p>

<p> of these grants and report to Congress by January 1, 1997. To
assist </p>

<p> Congress in its deliberations on whether to fund drug courts,
we </p>

<p> developed this preliminary report. Specifically, we gathered </p>

<p> information on drug courts in existence prior to the awarding
of </p>

<p> grants under the 1994 Crime Act, assessed evaluations of
these </p>

<p> courts, and reviewed the Department of Justice's (DOJ) </p>

<p> responsibilities and plans for implementing the federal drug
court </p>

<p> grant program. </p>

<p> During April and on May 11, 1995, we briefed the Committees
on the </p>

<p> results of our work. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 Throughout this briefing report, we use the terms drug
courts and </p>

<p> drug court programs interchangeably. </p>

<p> RESULTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :1 </p>

<p> In response to the deluge of drug cases since the late 1980s
and the </p>

<p> cycle of recidivism (rearrest rates) common to drug
offenders, some </p>

<p> state and local jurisdictions created drug courts, the
majority of </p>

<p> which have been operating since 1993. The main purpose of
drug </p>

<p> courts is to use the authority of the court to reduce crime
by </p>

<p> changing defendants' drug-using behavior. In exchange for the
</p>

<p> possibility of dismissed charges or reduced sentences,
defendants are </p>

<p> diverted to drug courts. Judges preside over drug court
proceedings, </p>

<p> monitor the progress of defendants through frequent status
hearings, </p>

<p> and prescribe sanctions and rewards as appropriate in
collaboration </p>

<p> with prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and
others. </p>

<p> Although there are basic elements common to many drug court
programs, </p>

<p> they vary in terms of participant eligibility, length of the
program, </p>

<p> penalties and rewards, and other practices. The courts are
supported </p>

<p> by a variety of local, state, federal, and private funds and </p>

<p> participant fees, according to the Drug Court Resource
Center.\2 </p>

<p> As of March 1995, there were at least 37 drug courts
operating </p>

<p> nationwide, most of which had been fully operational for at
least 9 </p>

<p> months. Thirty-three drug courts responding to our
questionnaire </p>

<p> reported having accepted over 20,000 defendants, of whom a
third had </p>

<p> completed their programs. According to the Project Director
of the </p>

<p> Drug Court Resource Center, none of the drug courts accept
defendants </p>

<p> currently charged with a violent offense, and most do not
accept </p>

<p> defendants with prior violent convictions. However, at least
one </p>

<p> drug court accepts defendants regardless of prior offenses.
(See </p>

<p> sect. I for more general information on drug courts.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations of five drug courts completed as
of March </p>

<p> 1995. Although some evaluation results indicated that drug
courts </p>

<p> may have some beneficial effects, limitations in their
designs and </p>

<p> methodologies, as well as the relative newness of drug
courts, </p>

<p> precluded firm conclusions about the overall impact of these </p>

<p> programs. The evaluations showed mixed results in recidivism
and </p>

<p> other defendant outcomes. For example, two evaluations showed
less </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants. However, three other </p>

<p> evaluations showed no significant differences in recidivism. </p>

<p> Additionally, two evaluations of the same drug court showed </p>

<p> contrasting recidivism results. (See sect. II and app. III
for </p>

<p> more information on the evaluations we assessed.) </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized the Attorney General to award
and </p>

<p> administer discretionary grants for drug court programs. A
key </p>

<p> requirement of the act is that violent offenders are
prohibited as </p>

<p> drug court participants. The act authorized $1 billion from
fiscal </p>

<p> years 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. For
fiscal </p>

<p> year 1995, $29 million was appropriated. However, Congress
has </p>

<p> proposed fiscal year 1995 budget cuts in a pending rescission
bill. </p>

<p> In addition, the House has passed legislation repealing the
drug </p>

<p> court grant program authorized in the 1994 Crime Act. </p>

<p> DOJ expects to award grants beginning in the summer of 1995.
The </p>

<p> 1994 Crime Act also authorizes the Attorney General to
provide for a </p>

<p> national evaluation of drug courts supported by federal
grants. DOJ </p>

<p> expects to complete the evaluation to assess the impact and </p>

<p> effectiveness of drug court grants in about 2 years. (See
sect. III </p>

<p> for more information.) </p>

<p> OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND </p>

<p> METHODOLOGY </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :2 </p>

<p> In preparation for our 1997 mandated study, we initiated a </p>

<p> preliminary review of drug court programs. Our objectives
were to </p>

<p> determine </p>

<p> the number, location, and key elements of drug courts; </p>

<p> the results and validity of evaluations of drug courts; and </p>

<p> DOJ's responsibilities and plans for implementing statutory </p>

<p> requirements for the federal drug court grant program. </p>

<p> The Drug Court Resource Center, which is based at The
American </p>

<p> University, Washington, D.C., provided us with general
information on </p>

<p> drug courts. To obtain more current information, we sent a </p>

<p> questionnaire to 37 drug courts. We received responses from
33 drug </p>

<p> courts as of March 31, 1995. We did not verify the accuracy
of the </p>

<p> data provided to us by the Drug Court Resource Center and
drug </p>

<p> courts. In addition, we attended a January 1995 national
training </p>

<p> conference for drug court professionals in Las Vegas, NV, and
visited </p>

<p> drug courts in Las Vegas and Washington, D.C. </p>

<p> To determine the results and assess the validity of
evaluations of </p>

<p> drug courts, we obtained 11 drug court evaluations completed
as of </p>

<p> March 1, 1995, from the Drug Court Resource Center. These </p>

<p> evaluations were done by a variety of sources, including
independent </p>

<p> researchers, county officials, and court representatives. We </p>

<p> reviewed them and assessed the evaluative methodology used
and the </p>

<p> validity of reported findings. We did not analyze the
reported </p>

<p> results of three of them because they reported outcome data
for drug </p>

<p> court defendants without any reference to comparison or
control </p>

<p> groups. We were unable to assess the validity of one because
it did </p>

<p> not include a description of the methodology used. Two dealt
with </p>

<p> one drug court and were assessed as one evaluation because
one was a </p>

<p> follow-up to the other and contained the same methodology and
</p>

<p> findings. </p>

<p> To determine DOJ's responsibilities and plans for
implementing the </p>

<p> federal grant program, we met with representatives of the
Office of </p>

<p> Justice Programs, DOJ. We held discussions and reviewed
documents </p>

<p> regarding their responsibilities and plans for implementing
the </p>

<p> federally supported drug court program. We also obtained drug
court </p>

<p> funding information from the Department of Health and Human
Services' </p>

<p> Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. </p>

<p> Our review was done from January 1995 to April 1995 in
accordance </p>

<p> with generally accepted government auditing standards. </p>

<p> AGENCY COMMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :3 </p>

<p> In April 1995, we provided a draft of this report for comment
to the </p>

<p> Attorney General and the Project Director of the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center. </p>

<p> On April 21, 1995, we discussed the report with the Project
Director </p>

<p> of the Drug Court Resource Center. On May 5, 1995, we also
discussed </p>

<p> the report with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General and
other </p>

<p> officials from DOJ's Office of Justice Programs. These
officials </p>

<p> generally agreed with the information presented in the report
and </p>

<p> provided comments that we incorporated as appropriate. </p>

<p> DOJ officials said the report was positive, informative, and
will be </p>

<p> helpful to drug court professionals. They explained that
there is no </p>

<p> universal model for drug courts, and as a result, each drug
court </p>

<p> operates differently due to local needs and conditions.
Similarly, </p>

<p> the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center said
that the </p>

<p> information presented in the report was comprehensive,
accurate, and </p>

<p> objective. </p>

==============================================================
Letter </p>

<p> TYPES OF DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :4 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In the late 1980s, state and local criminal courts were
inundated </p>

<p> with drug cases. One response to this challenge was the
creation of </p>

<p> drug courts, a relatively recent grassroots movement to deal
with </p>

<p> drug-related crime and drug-using defendants. </p>

<p> According to DOJ, two main types of drug courts have evolved,
those </p>

<p> that (1) expedite the processing of drug cases and (2) use </p>

<p> court-monitored drug treatment to attempt to achieve changes
in </p>

<p> defendants' drug-using behavior. In addition, some drug
courts </p>

<p> combine these two types. </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorizes grants for those drug courts
that have </p>

<p> programs offering court supervised drug treatment. The act
does not </p>

<p> authorize grants for courts designed solely to expedite the </p>

<p> processing of drug cases. This briefing report provides
information </p>

<p> on drug treatment courts. </p>

<p> Courts offering court-monitored drug treatment are referred
to as </p>

<p> &quot;drug treatment courts&quot; or simply &quot;drug
courts.&quot; Although there is no </p>

<p> standard definition applicable to drug treatment courts, the
National </p>

<p> Association of Drug Court Professionals\3 defines them as
follows: </p>

<p> &quot;A Drug Court is a special court given the
responsibility to </p>

<p> handle cases involving less serious drug using-offenders
through </p>

<p> a supervision and treatment program. These programs include </p>

<p> frequent drug testing, judicial and probation supervision,
drug </p>

<p> counseling, treatment, educational opportunities, and the use
of </p>

<p> sanctions and incentives.&quot; </p>

<p> One of the first drug courts to employ drug treatment as an
integral </p>

<p> part of the processing of drug felonies is located in Dade
County </p>

<p> (Miami), FL, and began operations in June 1989. This court
became a </p>

<p> model for other jurisdictions that implemented drug courts. </p>

<p> Although drug courts share certain common elements such as </p>

<p> court-monitored treatment, the courts are uniquely designed
to meet </p>

<p> local needs and can vary considerably in the way they
operate. </p>

<p> Organizationally, drug courts generally are distinct parts of
trial </p>

<p> courts. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \3 This is the principal organization of professionals
involved in </p>

<p> the development of treatment-oriented drug courts. Its
members </p>

<p> include judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment
service </p>

<p> providers, educators, researchers, and community leaders. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT APPROACHES </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :5.1 </p>

<p> According to a report provided by the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> drug courts have generally taken two approaches to processing
cases: </p>

<p> (1) deferred prosecution and (2) postadjudication. In the
deferred </p>

<p> prosecution approach, shortly after being charged, defendants
waive </p>

<p> their right to a speedy trial and enter a treatment program. </p>

<p> Defendants who fail to complete the treatment program have
their </p>

<p> charges adjudicated. Defendants who complete the treatment
program </p>

<p> are not prosecuted further or have their charges dismissed.
This </p>

<p> approach is intended to capitalize on the trauma of arrest
and offers </p>

<p> defendants the opportunity to obtain treatment and avoid the </p>

<p> possibility of a felony conviction. </p>

<p> In the postadjudication approach, defendants are tried and
convicted, </p>

<p> but their sentences are deferred or pronounced and
incarceration is </p>

<p> suspended until they complete or withdraw from the treatment
program. </p>

<p> This approach provides an incentive for the defendant to
rehabilitate </p>

<p> because progress toward rehabilitation is factored into the </p>

<p> sentencing determination. </p>

<p> Appendix I presents examples of how cases are processed under
the two </p>

<p> drug court approaches. </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY </p>

<p> CRITERIA </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :6.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, drug courts
generally </p>

<p> accept defendants with substance abuse problems who are
currently </p>

<p> charged with drug possession and/or other nonviolent offenses
such as </p>

<p> property crimes. Some drug courts accept defendants who have
prior </p>

<p> convictions, and others do not. </p>

<p> The Project Director of the Drug Court Resource Center also
pointed </p>

<p> out that drug courts do not accept defendants currently
charged with </p>

<p> a violent offense. The Project Director further commented
that most </p>

<p> drug courts do not accept defendants with prior violent
offenses. </p>

<p> However, at least one drug court accepts defendants
regardless of </p>

<p> prior offenses possibly including defendants with prior
convictions </p>

<p> for violent crimes. Under the 1994 Crime Act, federal grants
cannot </p>

<p> be awarded to any drug court that allows either current or
past </p>

<p> violent offenders to participate in its program. </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DRUG COURT PLAYERS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :7.1 </p>

<p> According to a DOJ-funded report on the first national drug
court </p>

<p> conference,\4 judicial leadership is the foundation on which
the </p>

<p> overall drug court approach is most often built. A
jurisdiction's </p>

<p> trial court provides the leadership, authority, and
management </p>

<p> capacity to enable the drug court to operate. The drug court
is </p>

<p> headed by a judge whose role is generally expanded beyond
normal </p>

<p> court duties to include active involvement in monitoring the
status </p>

<p> of defendants in the treatment program. The judge's duties
may </p>

<p> include conducting hearings, reviewing treatment progress
reports, </p>

<p> issuing bench warrants, and deciding who may enter the
program and </p>

<p> who should be terminated considering recommendations of
prosecutors, </p>

<p> public defenders, and treatment providers. </p>

<p> The judiciary alone, however, cannot successfully implement
and </p>

<p> operate a drug court, according to the conference report.
Rather, a </p>

<p> drug court requires a special collaborative effort among
judges, </p>

<p> prosecutors, defense attorneys, and related criminal justice
agencies </p>

<p> along with treatment providers and other social services and </p>

<p> community organizations. This collaborative effort is based
on local </p>

<p> needs and the targeted population being served and may differ
</p>

<p> considerably among drug courts. </p>

<p> Specifically, drug courts create new and different roles for </p>

<p> prosecutors and defense attorneys. In most drug courts these
players </p>

<p> are not adversaries in the traditional sense but rather are
to work </p>

<p> in concert with the court for the sole purpose of helping
defendants </p>

<p> become drug free. This nonadversarial role is significant
because </p>

<p> the court does not arbitrate in the usual fashion and has the
</p>

<p> opportunity to address addiction-related issues. Further,
drug </p>

<p> courts place the defendant in the unique role of being held
publicly </p>

<p> accountable for his or her actions. </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG COURT </p>

<p> PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COMMON ELEMENTS OF DRUG </p>

<p> COURT PROGRAMS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :8.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, in most drug
courts, </p>

<p> treatment is designed to usually last at least 1 year and is </p>

<p> administered on an outpatient basis with limited inpatient
treatment </p>

<p> as needed to address special detoxification or relapse
situations.\5 </p>

<p> These courts operate with the philosophy that because drug
addiction </p>

<p> is a disease relapses can occur, and that the court must
respond with </p>

<p> progressive sanctions and/or enhance treatment rather than </p>

<p> immediately terminate a participant. </p>

<p> The central element of all drug court programs is attendance
at the </p>

<p> regularly scheduled status hearings at which the drug court
judge </p>

<p> monitors the progress of participants. Monitoring is based on
</p>

<p> treatment provider reports on urine test results that detect
drug </p>

<p> use, attendance at counseling, etc. The judge reinforces
progress </p>

<p> and addresses noncompliance with program requirements. The
primary </p>

<p> objective of the status hearing is to keep the defendant in </p>

<p> treatment. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \5 These programs recognize that some individuals will
require a </p>

<p> longer period to complete the program. </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ------------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :9.1 </p>

<p> Overall, according to the Drug Court Resource Center,
treatment </p>

<p> program requirements are more demanding than the applicable
sanction </p>

<p> received through traditional adjudication. Most drug court
programs </p>

<p> require that defendants attend status hearings, participate
in </p>

<p> counseling sessions, and submit to urine tests with the goal
of </p>

<p> becoming drug free. Some programs focus on special classes of
</p>

<p> defendants such as women. Many programs also provide support </p>

<p> services such as public health services; assistance with
housing, </p>

<p> food, and child care; vocational training; and job placement.
</p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> TREATMENT PHASES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :10.1 </p>

<p> Treatment services are generally divided into three phases:
(1) </p>

<p> detoxification, (2) stabilization, and (3) aftercare. First,
the </p>

<p> defendant's physical dependence on drugs is eliminated
through </p>

<p> detoxification. Acupuncture is sometimes used as an adjunct
to </p>

<p> treatment in the detoxification phase. According to the
Project </p>

<p> Director of the Drug Court Resource Center, 9 of 20 drug
courts </p>

<p> responding to the Center's 1994 survey indicated that they
used </p>

<p> acupuncture. Second, the defendant's psychological craving
for the </p>

<p> drugs is treated during stabilization. Frequent group and/or </p>

<p> individual counseling sessions are employed during this
phase. And </p>

<p> third, aftercare focuses on helping the defendant obtain
education or </p>

<p> job training, find a job, and remain drug free. </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM SANCTIONS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :11.1 </p>

<p> Sanctions for failing to abide by program rules can include
(1) </p>

<p> verbal admonition from the judge; (2) demotion to an earlier
stage of </p>

<p> the program; (3) incarceration for several days or weeks,
increasing </p>

<p> with the number and severity of the violations; and (4) more
frequent </p>

<p> status hearings, treatment sessions, or urine tests. Many
programs </p>

<p> also use graduated sanctions, increasing the severity of the
sanction </p>

<p> with subsequent violations of program rules. </p>

<p> DOJ also pointed out that most drug courts use sanctions not
to </p>

<p> simply punish inappropriate behavior but to augment the
treatment </p>

<p> process. For example, many drug courts will place a defendant
in </p>

<p> residential treatment if he or she is unable to achieve
satisfactory </p>

<p> progress in an outpatient setting. In addition, many drug
courts </p>

<p> incarcerate defendants for the purpose of detoxification
rather than </p>

<p> detain them for inappropriate behavior. </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> REASONS FOR TERMINATING </p>

<p> DEFENDANTS FROM THE PROGRAM </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :12.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts use various criteria for ending a defendant's </p>

<p> participation in the program before completion. These may
include a </p>

<p> new felony offense; multiple failures to comply with program </p>

<p> requirements, such as not attending status hearings or
treatment </p>

<p> sessions; and a pattern of positive urine tests. According to
DOJ, </p>

<p> many drug courts do not terminate defendants for a new drug </p>

<p> possession offense. </p>

<p> Before terminating a defendant for continuing to use drugs,
drug </p>

<p> courts will use an array of treatment services and available </p>

<p> sanctions. There are no uniform standards for the number of
failed </p>

<p> urine tests and failures to attend treatment sessions that
result in </p>

<p> a participant being terminated that apply to all programs.
Each drug </p>

<p> court sets its own standards. Relapses are expected and the
extent </p>

<p> to which noncompliance results in terminations varies from
program to </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> Generally, the drug court judge makes the decision to
terminate, but </p>

<p> the prosecutor or treatment provider can recommend the
termination. </p>

<p> Once a defendant is terminated, he or she will be referred
for </p>

<p> adjudication or sentencing. </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> REQUIREMENTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :13.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts typically require defendants to complete a
treatment </p>

<p> program in order to graduate. Some impose other conditions </p>

<p> defendants must meet after treatment. These could include
remaining </p>

<p> drug free and not being arrested for a specified period of
time, </p>

<p> paying restitution, being employed full-time, or performing
community </p>

<p> service. </p>

<p> For example, the Seattle, WA, drug court requires that a
defendant </p>

<p> complete all phases of the program to graduate. However, the </p>

<p> Beaumont, TX, drug court requires that, in addition to
completing the </p>

<p> treatment program, the defendant maintain sobriety for a
specified </p>

<p> time and participate in education and vocational training
and/or be </p>

<p> working full-time. </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM GRADUATION </p>

<p> ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> EFFECTS OF PROGRAM </p>

<p> GRADUATION ON CASE OUTCOME </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :14.1 </p>

<p> In many jurisdictions, completion of the drug court program
leads to </p>

<p> a dismissal of charges or cessation of prosecution. In
others, the </p>

<p> guilty plea can be stricken, the defendant can be sentenced
to </p>

<p> probation in lieu of incarceration, or the defendant's
probation can </p>

<p> be shortened. </p>

<p> DOJ pointed out that some drug courts will seal all case
records, </p>

<p> including arrests, when defendants complete the program. The
sealing </p>

<p> of records is particularly significant when attempting to
measure the </p>

<p> impact of drug court programs at a later date. </p>

<p> STARTED, 1989-1994 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :15.1 </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center, as of March
1995, there </p>

<p> were at least 37 drug courts operating across the country.\6
Of these </p>

<p> drug courts, 29 had been fully operational for at least 9
months, and </p>

<p> 8 others had been operating for a lesser period. </p>

<p> The number of drug courts steadily increased from 1991 to
1994, with </p>

<p> substantial increases since 1993. As of March 1995, 24
jurisdictions </p>

<p> were developing drug courts. Another eight jurisdictions had </p>

<p> exhibited interest in starting drug courts by initiating
feasibility </p>

<p> studies. </p>

District </p>

<p> of Columbia. The largest number of drug courts are located in
</p>

<p> Florida, with 10, followed by California, with 6. There are
two drug </p>

<p> courts in each of six states, and there is one drug court in
each of </p>

<p> the remaining eight states and the District of Columbia. The </p>

<p> specific location of each drug court is shown in appendix II.

<p> DRUG COURT PARTICIPANTS' </p>

<p> STATUS AS OF MARCH 1995 </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :17.1 </p>

<p> Data obtained from 33 of 37 drug courts responding to our </p>

<p> questionnaire showed that since inception of the first drug
court in </p>

<p> 1989, 20,421 persons have participated in drug courts. Of
these, </p>

<p> 7,235 participants have graduated, and 7,595 are currently in
the </p>

<p> programs. The remaining participants did not complete the
programs. </p>

<p> Generally, when participants do not complete drug court
programs it </p>

<p> is because they were terminated, voluntarily withdrew, or
died. </p>

<p> Based on the data received, these totaled 5,591.\7 </p>

<p> The number of participants currently in each of these drug
court </p>

<p> programs varied widely, ranging from a low of 1 participant
in Santa </p>

<p> Ana, CA, a new drug court,\8 to a high of 1,200 participants
in </p>

<p> Miami, FL, one of the oldest drug courts. The median number
of </p>

<p> participants in these drug court programs is 105. </p>

<p> It should be noted that many of the drug courts have been
operating </p>

<p> for less than a year and would not yet have graduates. As
shown, </p>

<p> more than one-third of the total participants are currently
enrolled </p>

<p> in drug court programs. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \7 We calculated the number (5,591) of participants not
completing </p>

<p> the programs by subtracting the number (7,235) of graduates
and the </p>

<p> number (7,595) of participants currently in the programs from
the </p>

<p> total number (20,421) of participants in the programs since
their </p>

<p> inception. </p>

<p> \8 At the time of our review, Orange County, CA, had filed
for </p>

<p> bankruptcy and curtailed resources for its drug court. </p>

<p> FUNDING SOURCES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :18 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> According to the Drug Court Resource Center Project Director,
drug </p>

<p> courts generally piece together funding from a variety of
sources. </p>

<p> Information reported to the Drug Court Resource Center by 15
drug </p>

<p> courts showed that these sources included local taxes and
surcharges, </p>

<p> state alcohol and drug agency funds, private foundation
monies, </p>

<p> participant fees, and federal grants. </p>

<p> Some drug courts have developed innovative funding
approaches. For </p>

<p> example, a drug court judge from Orange County, CA, told us
that when </p>

<p> the county filed for bankruptcy, it cut back services
necessary for </p>

<p> the drug court operation. The judge said that he was forming
a </p>

<p> nonprofit corporation to try to provide funding for the drug
court </p>

<p> outside of the bankruptcy proceedings. </p>

<p> Until the 1994 Crime Act, there was no federal grant program </p>

<p> specifically designed for drug courts. However, some drug
courts </p>

<p> have received federal grants and technical assistance from
the </p>

<p> Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse </p>

<p> Treatment (CSAT) and DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance
(BJA). </p>

<p> According to CSAT, it has provided or plans to provide an
estimated </p>

<p> $15 million in assistance to some drug courts. Of the $15
million, </p>

<p> about $6 million is for a drug court demonstration project
for the </p>

<p> District of Columbia Superior Court. </p>

<p> BJA could not provide us with complete information on DOJ
grants used </p>

<p> in support of drug courts. According to a BJA official,
&quot;drug </p>

<p> courts&quot; was not a specific grant category that grantees
could </p>

<p> designate for funding. However, this official commented that
BJA is </p>

<p> aware that DOJ grant funds provided under other grant
categories such </p>

<p> as &quot;corrections options&quot; have been used in support
of drug courts, </p>

<p> and that three drug courts had received $2.5 million from the
</p>

<p> Corrections Options program.\9 </p>

<p> \9 The Corrections Options program assists states with
design, </p>

<p> development, and implementation of innovative alternatives to
</p>

<p> traditional modes of incarceration. </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> PARTICIPANT FEES </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :19.1 </p>

<p> We obtained data (based on our questionnaire and information
provided </p>

<p> by the Drug Court Resource Center) from 34 drug courts on
fees </p>

<p> charged to participants in drug court programs. Twenty-three
of the </p>

<p> 34 drug courts reported that they charged fees, and 11
reported that </p>

<p> they did not. Insufficient data on fee amounts actually
collected </p>

<p> precluded us from determining the extent to which drug courts
relied </p>

<p> on participant fees as a funding source. </p>

<p> Of the 23 drug courts charging participant fees, the amounts
charged </p>

<p> for the total cost of treatment ranged from $20 to $2,500.
One drug </p>

<p> court reported charging fees on a sliding scale from $60 to
$300 for </p>

<p> treatment based on a defendant's ability to pay, while
another </p>

<p> reported charging on a sliding scale from $500 to $2,500. At
least </p>

<p> nine courts responded that they charged fees ranging from
$200 to </p>

<p> $350. </p>

<p> Several drug courts reported applying participant fees to
counseling </p>

<p> and treatment costs, drug testing costs, and other program
expenses. </p>

<p> In addition, DOJ commented that many treatment providers
believe </p>

<p> participant fees are a useful therapeutic tool and should be
charged </p>

<p> regardless of the extent to which fees are needed to cover
program </p>

<p> costs. </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

Letter :20 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> COST SAVINGS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :20.1 </p>

<p> Drug courts have reported information to the Drug Court
Resource </p>

<p> Center on savings that they believe their programs have
achieved in </p>

<p> the costs of court and other criminal justice system
operations. </p>

<p> One of the larger categories of savings reported by drug
courts was </p>

<p> jail costs avoided, i.e., the estimated costs of
incarcerating a </p>

<p> typical drug court defendant that would be expected to incur
if </p>

<p> he/she were not participating in a drug court program. One
court </p>

<p> estimated savings of $5,400 per drug court participant, and
another </p>

<p> estimated savings of $2,566 to $5,185. </p>

<p> Another drug court claimed a savings of $2 million over a
3-year </p>

<p> period resulting from drug court participants spending fewer
days in </p>

<p> custody and the consequent ability of the county to rent
unused jail </p>

<p> cells to other law enforcement agencies. Still another drug
court </p>

<p> estimated it had saved about $875,500 in jail costs for its
program </p>

<p> but did not specify the time frame. </p>

<p> The National Association of Drug Court Professionals noted
that drug </p>

<p> court programs are much less costly than the incarceration of
</p>

<p> drug-using offenders. The Association reported that
incarceration of </p>

<p> drug-using offenders ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 annually,
and the </p>

<p> cost to build a prison cell is $80,000 to $90,000. It also
said that </p>

<p> drug courts cost less than $1,500 annually for each offender.
</p>

<p> Some drug courts identified savings such as reduced caseloads
of </p>

<p> other trial judges not in the drug court program. In
addition, some </p>

<p> drug courts claimed savings in court-appointed attorney fees,
reduced </p>

<p> probation office caseloads, and costs of prosecution,
arrests, and </p>

<p> police overtime. </p>

<p> We did not verify this information, and further analysis of
all drug </p>

<p> court costs is essential to fully understanding the benefits
of these </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

==============================================================
Letter </p>

<p> DO DRUG COURTS MAKE A </p>

<p> DIFFERENCE? </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :21 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> In evaluating the effectiveness of drug courts, the basic
question </p>

<p> is: Do drug courts make a difference? Specifically, do
defendants </p>

<p> who successfully complete drug court programs exhibit reduced
</p>

<p> recidivism, decreased drug use, and other socially beneficial
effects </p>

<p> as a result of participating in drug court programs when
compared to </p>

<p> their counterparts, i.e., control groups who were not exposed
to the </p>

<p> same drug court treatment? </p>

<p> Based on evaluations we reviewed, drug courts generally may
have some </p>

<p> beneficial effects. However, because of the nature of the
study </p>

<p> designs and the short periods of time elapsed between
treatment and </p>

<p> measurement of outcomes (drug courts are relatively new),
firm </p>

<p> conclusions cannot be drawn about the effects of drug courts.
</p>

<p> It is both difficult and costly to conduct program
evaluations that </p>

<p> can measure program effects. Although the strongest design
involves </p>

<p> assembling and randomly assigning defendants to control
groups </p>

<p> (comparing drug courts versus traditional courts, for
example), such </p>

<p> studies raise serious logistical and ethical issues.
Additionally, </p>

<p> according to the Project Director of the Drug Court Resource
Center, </p>

<p> control groups cannot be used properly unless a drug court is
</p>

<p> originally designed to define such groups. </p>

<p> An alternative approach is to design studies allowing the
researcher </p>

<p> to create comparable groups from existing programs, through
the use </p>

<p> of various analytical techniques. However, even such studies
are </p>

<p> often made more difficult by the fact that existing programs
change </p>

<p> over time, resulting in individuals at the end of the study
period </p>

<p> being exposed to different treatments than those at the
beginning. </p>

<p> Also, different locations of the same program may have very
different </p>

<p> implementation needs, making it more difficult to compare
such </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> GAO ASSESSED DRUG COURT </p>

<p> EVALUATIONS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :22 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> We assessed six evaluations that compared performance
outcomes for </p>

<p> drug court defendants to the experiences of other defendants,
i.e., </p>

<p> previous divertees or unsuccessful drug court defendants or </p>

<p> defendants who had never been in a drug court. In order to
determine </p>

<p> whether a drug court has an impact on its participants, an
evaluation </p>

<p> should compare outcomes of drug court defendants to those of
other </p>

<p> groups of similar defendants who are not in drug courts. </p>

<p> The six evaluations covered five drug courts and varied
considerably </p>

<p> in terms of the study designs, types of outcomes measured,
and scope </p>

<p> of analyses performed on the available information. Our
assessment </p>

<p> indicates that the evaluations differed particularly in terms
of the </p>

<p> validity of the designs, which determine the extent to which
the </p>

<p> reader is able to draw conclusions from any findings. Of the
six </p>

<p> studies: </p>

<p> two studies had fairly strong designs; of these, one provided
some </p>

<p> evidence of an effect of the drug court program, and the
other </p>

<p> study's results were too preliminary to draw any conclusions;
</p>

<p> two studies had designs with more serious problems; of these,
one </p>

<p> suggested possible effects of the program, and the other was </p>

<p> inconclusive; and </p>

<p> two studies had design weaknesses that prevented any
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the program. </p>

<p> The major outcome measure used, in five of the six
evaluations, was </p>

<p> recidivism (rearrest rates). To a lesser degree,
recidivism-related </p>

<p> measures were also used, such as length of time before
rearrest and </p>

<p> days spent in custody for felony offenses. We focused on
these </p>

<p> measures in this report because they provided the strongest
evidence </p>

<p> for the long-term effect of the drug court programs, even
though </p>

<p> other measures were used in these studies. </p>

<p> EVALUATION OUTCOMES </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :23 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Two of the six evaluations were well-designed. However, the
results </p>

<p> in terms of recidivism outcomes were mixed. One of the
evaluations </p>

<p> showed that drug court defendants had significantly lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates than defendants not in drug court, and that they spent
fewer </p>

<p> days in custody for felony offenses (app. III, evaluation 1).
This </p>

<p> evaluation also showed that drug court defendants had a lower
rate of </p>

<p> failures-to-appear for required court hearings than did other
</p>

<p> defendants. However, the other evaluation, with preliminary </p>

<p> information only, showed no significant difference so far in
rearrest </p>

<p> rates between drug court defendants and defendants who were
not in </p>

<p> the drug court (app. III, evaluation 2). </p>

<p> Although these evaluations have strong study designs and one </p>

<p> indicates some beneficial effects on defendants resulting
from the </p>

<p> drug court programs, the evidence does not permit firm
conclusions </p>

<p> about the effects of the drug courts studied. Additionally,
for one </p>

<p> of the evaluations, insufficient time had elapsed to provide
firmer </p>

<p> evidence of program effect. </p>

<p> Of the next two evaluations, both of the same drug court, one
</p>

<p> provided some suggestive evidence of program effect. It
showed lower </p>

<p> recidivism by drug court defendants and longer time before
rearrest </p>

<p> (app. III, evaluation 3). The other generally showed no
difference </p>

<p> in recidivism rates (app. III, evaluation 4). Design problems
made </p>

<p> it difficult to attribute these findings to the programs.
There are </p>

<p> too many potential differences between the drug court
participants </p>

<p> and the groups to which they were compared to develop strong </p>

<p> conclusions. </p>

<p> The final two evaluations did not provide reliable evidence </p>

<p> concerning the effects of the programs. One showed no
substantial </p>

<p> difference in recidivism between drug court defendants and
defendants </p>

<p> who left the drug court (app. III, evaluation 5). The other </p>

<p> evaluation measured defendants' drug abstinence and
failure-to-appear </p>

<p> rates and showed positive results for drug court defendants
as </p>

<p> compared to defendants terminated from the drug court (app.
III, </p>

<p> evaluation 6). Because the study design did not control for a
number </p>

<p> of factors, such as motivation and susceptibility to
treatment, these </p>

<p> evaluations do not permit conclusions to be drawn about the
effects </p>

<p> of the programs. </p>

<p> Appendix III contains further information on each of these </p>

<p> evaluations. </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> THE 1994 CRIME ACT </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :24.1 </p>

<p> Beginning in fiscal year 1995, DOJ may provide jurisdictions
with </p>

<p> drug court grants. Title V of the Violent Crime Control and
Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) authorizes the
Attorney </p>

<p> General to award discretionary drug court grants to states,
units of </p>

<p> local government, Indian tribal governments, and state and
local </p>

<p> courts. Grants may be awarded to drug court programs when a
judge </p>

<p> continuously supervises the progress of nonviolent offenders
with </p>

<p> substance abuse problems. </p>

<p> The act requires the Attorney General to issue regulations to
ensure </p>

<p> that jurisdictions receiving drug court grants to support
their </p>

<p> programs do not allow violent offenders to participate. It
defines a </p>

<p> violent offender as a person who is charged with or convicted
of an </p>

<p> offense involving a firearm, dangerous weapon, death, serious
bodily </p>

<p> injury, or force; or who has one or more prior convictions
for a </p>

<p> violent felony crime. </p>

<p> Drug court programs must also integrate a number of judicial </p>

<p> sanctions and treatment services. Specifically, the act
requires </p>

<p> programs to include (1) mandatory periodic testing for the
use of </p>

<p> addictive substances; (2) substance abuse treatment; (3)
diversion, </p>

<p> probation, or other supervised releases with the possibility
of </p>

<p> prosecution, confinement, or incarceration when participants
do not </p>

<p> comply with program requirements or fail to show satisfactory
</p>

<p> progress; and (4) program and aftercare services, such as
relapse </p>

<p> prevention, health care, education, vocational training, job </p>

<p> placement, housing placement, and child care. </p>

<p> FEDERAL FUNDING FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> ---------------------------------------------------------
Letter :25.1 </p>

<p> The 1994 Crime Act authorized a total of $1 billion for
fiscal years </p>

<p> 1995 through 2000 to support drug court programs. Although
the act </p>

<p> authorized $100 million for fiscal year 1995, DOJ's fiscal
year 1995 </p>

<p> Appropriations Act (Public Law 103-317) included only $29
million for </p>

<p> the drug court program. However, Congress has proposed fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1995 budget cuts for the drug court program. On March 16,
1995, the </p>

<p> House passed H.R. 1158, the Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations </p>

<p> Act of 1995, which rescinds $27.75 million for the drug court
</p>

<p> program. During its consideration of H.R. 1158, the Senate
reduced </p>

<p> the rescission to $17.1 million. On April 6, 1995, the Senate
passed </p>

<p> its version of the bill and requested a conference with the
House. </p>

<p> The House and Senate conferees began May 3, 1995, to try to
reconcile </p>

<p> the separate provisions of the bill. </p>

<p> The President's fiscal year 1996 budget requests $150 million
for </p>

<p> drug court grants. However, H.R. 667 (The Violent Crime </p>

<p> Incarceration Act of 1995) passed by the House of
Representatives on </p>

<p> February 10, 1995, would amend Title V of the 1994 Crime Act
and in </p>

<p> doing so would repeal the 1994 Crime Act's drug court
discretionary </p>

<p> grant provisions. On February 22, 1995, H.R. 667 was referred
to </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. </p>

<p> DOJ'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DRUG </p>

<p> COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :26 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> DOJ recognizes that no single model exists for an effective
drug </p>

<p> court. Consequently, DOJ plans to maintain flexibility in
awarding </p>

<p> grants to programs that use a variety of approaches to
coordinate </p>

<p> drug treatment and persuade offenders to abstain from drugs
with the </p>

<p> goal of becoming drug free. In addition, given the great
diversity </p>

<p> in the structure and operation of state and local courts and
criminal </p>

<p> justice systems, DOJ plans to allow jurisdictions to tailor
local </p>

<p> initiatives to best suit their needs and local conditions. </p>

<p> DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) has overall
responsibility for </p>

<p> the new federal drug court program, including policy setting.
To </p>

<p> carry out this responsibility, OJP has hired an acting
director and </p>

<p> policy analyst to staff its Drug Court Program Office. In
addition, </p>

<p> BJA, an office of OJP, recently established a Drug Court
Program </p>

<p> Office to manage and monitor drug court program grants,
according to </p>

<p> an OJP official. BJA has hired four people to staff this
office. </p>

<p> Since November 1994, OJP and BJA staffs have worked together
to </p>

<p> develop program guidelines and application materials.\10 </p>

<p> Currently, these staffs are considering the most appropriate
and </p>

<p> effective ways of providing technical assistance to federally
</p>

<p> supported drug courts, operating drug courts, and related
federal </p>

<p> projects to be funded with other fiscal year 1995 resources.
The </p>

<p> level and source of funding to support this technical
assistance is </p>

<p> also under review. </p>

<p> OJP's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is responsible for
funding </p>

<p> a national evaluation of drug court program impacts. This
evaluation </p>

<p> will assess whether federally supported drug court programs
have </p>

<p> helped their participants to break the cycle of substance
abuse and </p>

<p> crime. It will also assess the cost-effectiveness of these
programs. </p>

<p> NIJ is also responsible for ensuring that drug court programs
use </p>

<p> part of their grants to conduct process evaluations. These
are aimed </p>

<p> at determining, among other things, if the drug court is
achieving </p>

<p> its objectives, if it was implemented as originally intended,
and </p>

<p> whether major changes are appropriate. They will also examine
how </p>

<p> drug courts affect the rest of the court system and other
elements of </p>

<p> the criminal justice system. </p>

Letter :27.1 </p>

<p> If Congress does not rescind the fiscal year 1995
appropriation, DOJ </p>

<p> plans to award grants for planning, implementing, and
improving or </p>

<p> enhancing drug court programs. Eligible applicants may apply
only </p>

<p> for one type of grant. Assuming no rescission is enacted, of
the $29 </p>

<p> million appropriated for fiscal year 1995, DOJ plans to award
up to </p>

<p> 100 planning grants for not more than $35,000 each to
jurisdictions </p>

<p> interested in establishing drug courts, </p>

<p> 10 implementation grants for not more than $1 million each to
</p>

<p> jurisdictions that have identified their target populations
and </p>

<p> case processing procedures, </p>

<p> 3 additional implementation grants for not more than $2
million to </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions with populations exceeding 1 million,
and </p>

<p> 20 improvement and enhancement grants for not more than $1
million </p>

<p> to jurisdictions that have already established drug courts. </p>

<p> Federal grants for each drug court program will be 75 percent
of </p>

<p> program costs. The grantees will be required to provide cash
to fund </p>

<p> the remaining 25 percent. </p>

<p> Applications are due by May 23, 1995. Then, OJP and BJA
staffs will </p>

<p> focus on screening and processing qualified applications for </p>

<p> potential grant awards, pending final congressional action on
the </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995 budget rescission. If the current deadline

<p> expected to be awarded in the summer of 1995. </p>

<p> EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR </p>

<p> FEDERALLY FUNDED DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> -----------------------------------------------------------
Letter :28 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Evaluating effectiveness is a critical element of the federal
drug </p>

<p> court program. The 1994 Crime Act authorizes the Attorney
General to </p>

<p> carry out or make arrangements for evaluations of programs
that </p>

<p> receive discretionary program grants. The act also mandates
us to </p>

<p> study and assess the effectiveness and impact of these
discretionary </p>

<p> grants and report to the Congress by January 1, 1997. </p>

<p> OJP program guidelines require recipients of drug court
grants to </p>

<p> cooperate with a national evaluation team. The evaluation
will be </p>

<p> aimed at measuring program impact primarily through the use
of the </p>

<p> following criteria: </p>

<p> reduction in recidivism rates of program participants, </p>

<p> maintenance of acceptable treatment completion rates, </p>

<p> decreased participant drug use, and </p>

<p> maintenance of a cost-effective program. </p>

<p> NIJ is responsible for overseeing the national evaluation.
The </p>

<p> evaluation will focus on treatment and its impact and is
expected to </p>

<p> take at least 2 years to complete. At the time of our review,
NIJ </p>

<p> was developing the solicitation for proposals to conduct the </p>

<p> evaluation. </p>

<p> Program guidelines also require each drug court grant
recipient to </p>

<p> conduct process evaluations of their programs. For these </p>

<p> evaluations, grantees are expected to collect descriptive
information </p>

<p> on the role of drug court players, potential eligible
population, and </p>

<p> participant program characteristics. Grantees will also be
asked to </p>

<p> collect information on program procedures used to identify
and screen </p>

<p> eligible offenders, accept and assess offenders, respond to
relapses, </p>

<p> manage and monitor cases, and discharge and refer
participants. </p>

<p> OUTCOMES REPORTED IN AND GAO'S </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT OF EVALUATIONS OF FIVE </p>

<p> DRUG COURTS </p>

<p> =========================================================
Appendix III </p>

<p> EVALUATION 1: F.I.R.S.T. </p>

<p> OAKLAND </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:1 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.1 </p>

<p> Drug use defendants granted admission to a diversion program.
</p>

<p> Admission requirements changed during the course of the
study. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 110 defendants in a program with a similar
group of 110 </p>

<p> defendants in a different program a year earlier. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.3 </p>

<p> Drug court participants referred in January and February of
1991; </p>

<p> earlier group referred in January 1990 through March of 1990.
The </p>

<p> report contained a 3-year follow-up study. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Felony rearrests: Drug court defendants had a lower
average rate </p>

<p> of felony rearrests per defendants (0.75) than had previous
divertees </p>

<p> (1.33). </p>

<p> (2)Days in custody for felony offenses: Drug court
defendants, on </p>

<p> average, spent fewer days in custody per defendant (44) than
had </p>

<p> previous divertees (78). </p>

<p> (3)Bench warrants: Drug court defendants, on average, had
fewer </p>

<p> bench warrants issued for failures to appear at court
hearings (0.67) </p>

<p> than had previous divertees (1.1). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:1.0.5 </p>

<p> There were some questions concerning the comparability of the
two </p>

<p> groups, as well as the eligibility requirements for the two
programs. </p>

<p> (The report stated that eligibility requirements were relaxed
for the </p>

<p> drug court program participants in order to obtain a broader
group </p>

<p> for comparative purposes.) In spite of these concerns, the
evaluation </p>

<p> suggested some fairly strong evidence of program success
after 3 </p>

<p> years. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 2: MARICOPA COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:2 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.1 </p>

<p> Offenders sentenced to probation for first-time drug
possession </p>

<p> convictions. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.2 </p>

<p> Random assignment to four groups: </p>

<p> (1)No drug testing, frequent visits (n=approximately 154). </p>

<p> (2)Monthly random drug testing, occasional visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (3)Biweekly scheduled drug testing, limited visits
(n=approximately </p>

<p> 154). </p>

<p> (4)Drug court, with testing and treatment supervised by a
probation </p>

<p> officer (n=177). </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in program between March 1992 and April 1993.
Current </p>

<p> data reported only preliminary findings after 6 months. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: No statistically significant differences
(16.95 </p>

<p> percent for the drug court group vs. 15.37 percent for
others). </p>

<p> (2)Rates of technical probation violations: Drug court group
had </p>

<p> lower rates than those of others (7.9 percent vs. 11.9
percent). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:2.0.5 </p>

<p> Although the evaluation design was quite strong, the results
were </p>

<p> preliminary; insufficient time had elapsed to provide a firm </p>

<p> indication of program effect. Future comparisons may be
complicated </p>

<p> by the fact that the drug court sample had lower rates of
reported </p>

<p> history of prior marijuana use. Otherwise, the control groups
</p>

<p> (groups 1-3) were quite similar to the drug court group
(group 4). </p>

<p> EVALUATION 3: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (GOLDKAMP AND WEILAND) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:3 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.1 </p>

<p> Persons arrested for 2nd and 3rd degree drug-related
felonies. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.2 </p>

<p> Five key groups:\11 </p>

<p> (1)Persons admitted to drug court program (n=326). </p>

<p> (2)Sample of felony drug defendants in same period not
eligible </p>

<p> because of more serious drug-related offenses (n=199). </p>

<p> (3)Sample of nondrug felony defendants in same period
(n=185). </p>

<p> (4)Sample of felony drug defendants in period several years
earlier </p>

<p> (n=302). </p>

<p> (5)Sample of felony nondrug defendants in period several
years </p>

<p> earlier (n=536). </p>

<p> In addition, the evaluation compared persons completing the
drug </p>

<p> court program with those failing to complete. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \11 An additional sample of offenders could not reliably be
used as a </p>

<p> control group because they were exposed to the drug court
program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants in groups 1-3 had charges filed in August 1990
and </p>

<p> September 1990. Charges for groups 4-5 were filed in the
summer of </p>

<p> 1987. Data report results after 18 month follow-up. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: Drug court defendants were rearrested at a
</p>

<p> statistically significant lower rate (33 percent, vs. 40
percent to </p>

<p> 53 percent for other groups). </p>

<p> (2)Time before rearrest: Drug court defendants had
statistically </p>

<p> significant longer time before rearrest (median of 235 days,
vs. 52 </p>

<p> to 115 days for other groups). </p>

<p> (3)Rearrests and treatment completion: Rearrest rates were </p>

<p> associated with failure to complete the treatment program. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:3.0.5 </p>

<p> The results suggested an effect of the program. However, the
study </p>

<p> design was unable to make the comparison with offenders in
the same </p>

<p> situation with similarly serious drug offenses; therefore,
the </p>

<p> results must be interpreted cautiously. In particular, the
drug </p>

<p> court sample had fewer prior arrests than had the other
comparison </p>

<p> groups, and the key group of felony drug defendants used for </p>

<p> comparative purposes were not eligible for the drug court
program </p>

<p> because of the seriousness of their charges or prior records.
</p>

<p> The comparisons between those completing and failing to
complete the </p>

<p> program must also be viewed with caution, due to possible </p>

<p> motivational and other differences between the groups. </p>

<p> In commenting on a draft of this report, DOJ officials noted
that </p>

<p> this study had a strong design with carefully drawn
comparison </p>

<p> groups. We agree that the study's design was generally
strong. </p>

<p> However, as we state in this report, there were some
potentially </p>

<p> important differences in prior arrest rates between the
groups, and </p>

<p> the study was not able to compare similarly situated drug
defendants </p>

<p> in a roughly similar time period. Therefore, as we noted, the
</p>

<p> study's results should be interpreted cautiously. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 4: DADE COUNTY </p>

<p> (SMITH, DAVIS AND GORETSKY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:4 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants with no prior convictions charged with a drug
possession </p>

<p> offense, admitting to a drug problem for which they wanted
treatment. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 318 defendants assigned to the drug court with
a sample </p>

<p> of 99 narcotics cases in early 1988. In addition, a group of
drug </p>

<p> court defendants who were accepted into the drug court
program were </p>

<p> compared on rearrest rates. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants were assigned to the drug court in January 1990
through </p>

<p> March 1990. The comparison group was charged between January
1988 </p>

<p> and March 1988. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.4 </p>

<p> (1)Rearrest rates: There was no statistically significant
difference </p>

<p> in the rate of felony rearrests after 1 year between those
assigned </p>

<p> to drug court (32 percent) and the comparison group of
defendants </p>

<p> charged 2 years earlier (33 percent). Those defendants
accepted by </p>

<p> the drug court did have lower rates of rearrest (15 percent),
but the </p>

<p> authors noted that these individuals constituted &quot;a
highly select </p>

<p> group . . . least disposed to commit new crimes.&quot; The
rearrest </p>

<p> results in this evaluation differed from those in the other </p>

<p> evaluation of Dade County (evaluation 3). </p>

<p> (2)Sentencing dispositions: There were statistically
significant </p>

<p> differences in dispositions between those assigned to drug
court and </p>

<p> the comparison group of earlier defendants. Those assigned to
drug </p>

<p> court were more likely not to face further prosecution and
less </p>

<p> likely to serve probation or short jail terms. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:4.0.5 </p>

<p> There were concerns about the comparability of the
participants in </p>

<p> the various groups. In particular, the finding of lower
rearrest </p>

<p> rates for program participants should be viewed cautiously in
light </p>

<p> of the selectivity of admission to the program. As a result,
there </p>

<p> were strong reservations about the results reported. </p>

<p> DOJ officials, in commenting on a draft of this report,
indicated </p>

<p> that this study had several flaws. They pointed out that the
study </p>

<p> was done when this drug court was less than 10 months old.
They </p>

<p> further noted that information on successful drug court
participants </p>

<p> was not available for evaluation because the participants'
records </p>

<p> were sealed. We concur with these comments. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 5: BROWARD COUNTY </p>

<p> (TERRY) </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:5 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.1 </p>

<p> First-time offenders arrested for possession or purchase of
cocaine. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 392 defendants completing or remaining in the
drug </p>

<p> court program with 241 defendants not completing the drug
court </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program from July 1991 through June
1992. </p>

<p> Study results were reported for October 1993. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.4 </p>

<p> Rearrests: Persons remaining in the program committed
felonies at a </p>

<p> slightly lower rate than did those leaving the program (7.7
percent </p>

<p> vs. 12.0 percent). (Cases dismissed were not included in
these </p>

<p> comparisons.) No differences occurred in comparing the
proportions </p>

<p> having committed misdemeanors (4.1 percent for persons
remaining in </p>

<p> the program vs. 5.0 percent for those leaving the program). </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:5.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<p> EVALUATION 6: MULTNOMAH COUNTY </p>

<p> -------------------------------------------------------
Appendix III:6 </p>

<p> TREATMENT GROUP </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.1 </p>

<p> Defendants arrested for possession of any illegal substance
for </p>

<p> personal use. </p>

<p> STUDY DESIGN </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.2 </p>

<p> Comparison of 105 defendants graduating from the drug court
program </p>

<p> with 78 defendants who terminated unsuccessfully. </p>

<p> TIME OF STUDY </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.3 </p>

<p> Participants entered the program on or before August 1, 1992,
and </p>

<p> graduated or terminated unsuccessfully on or before April 1,
1994. </p>

<p> KEY MEASURES </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.4 </p>

<p> Graduates had lower rates of bench warrants for failure to
appear, </p>

<p> went slightly longer before the first bench warrant was
issued, and </p>

<p> had a lower percentage of positive urine tests than those who
</p>

<p> terminated unsuccessfully. However, the report did not
indicate </p>

<p> whether these figures referred to prior histories or
follow-up </p>

<p> information after program completion. </p>

<p> ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> --------------------------------------------------- Appendix
III:6.0.5 </p>

<p> There was no adequate comparison group in this study from
which to </p>

<p> draw any conclusions about the effect of the program. </p>

<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p> Despite the demonstrated relationships between drug abuse and
crime, criminal justice agencies too seldom focus on reducing
drug abuse as a means of reducing the criminal activities of
drug-involved offenders. Yet evidence from the research
literature continues to accumulate, indicating that some drug
treatment programs have been successful in reducing recidivism.
Following an overview of pertinent research findings, this paper
outlines the elements of an effective strategy for treating
cocaine and heroin abusing offenders. </p>

<p> The interventions proposed in this paper grow out of the drug
abuse research literature, the authors' urban-based research, and
their clinical expcriencc with drug abuse treatment in
corrections. In addition, the suggested interventions emerge from
years of correctional outcome research which has assessed what
works, with whom, and under what circumstances. Although this
paper will focus on heroin and cocaine involved offenders, some
recommendations may apply to offenders who use other illicit
drugs. </p>

<h3><a name="ResearchFindings">Research findings</a> </h3>

<h4><a name="TheProblem">The problem </a></h4>

<p> Recent research provides amplc evidence that offender
populations are composed of large numbers of drug abusers-and
that drug-involved offenders commit substantial number-, of
undetected crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Very recent cocaine and heroin abusers constitute a
majority of the arrestees and inmates in jails and prisons in New
York City and some other jurisdictions.</b> </p>

<p> National surveys of jail and prison populations, smaller
self-report studies, and urine testing results indicate that
increasing proportions of offenders are users of drugs and that
cocaine use is increasing the most rapidly. More than
three-quarters of the nation's inmates and almost all inmates in
New York City report illicit drug use.' Similarly, sclf-rcport
studies among prison and jail inmates in California, Michigan,
and Texas reveal that approximately half are heroin users and
many are daily heroin users.' Recent urinalysis-based studies of
arrestees in Washington, D.C. reveal that well over half test
positive for at least one illicit drug and a quarter test
positive for two or more illicit drugs, In a recent Manhattan
study the level of co caine use had doubled .;ince 1984.
Eighty-three percent of arrestees in September and October 1986
tested positive for cocaine, compared with 42 percent in 1984;
the increase in cocaine was found at all age levels and for all
offenses. Comparable increases have also been reported in
Washington, DC. </p>

<p> <b>Frequent users of heroin and cocaine in the general
population exhibit </b>a <b>multiproblem lifestyle that may
include a pattern of persistent criminal behavior.</b> </p>

<p> Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing condition that is part
of a complex multiproblem lifestyle which is highly resistant to
rehabilitation. Several studies show that daily or near daily
heroin users-many of whom also use other illicit substances
daily-are not in treatment, and do not seek treatment. Many also
consume alcohol heavily. They average over 200 non-drug crimcs
and hundreds of drug distribution offenses annually, yet are
unlikely to be arrested more than once a year, and then spend
less than a month in incarceration, The majority commit many
crimes for which they are not arrested or incarcerated, but
because of sheer volume of activity, they still have many more
arrests and incarceration periods than non-drug offenders. Over
half their generally modest income comes from drug distribution
activities. They usually spend most of that income on drugs.
Daily heroin abusers also generally do not have a residence nor
make their own meals, but rather stay and eat with a relative or
friend. They do not receive or seek public assistance. They have
no legal employment during a typical week nor do they seek any.
Thus, they are typically an economic burden on the poorest
members of their low-income communities. Many aspects of their
lifestyle also put them at high risk for violence and many other
social and health problems such as AIDS, alcoholism, and TB.
Therefore, whatever treatment programming is applied to this
population, it must contend with all or most of these problems if
it is to achieve long-term changes in this lifestyle.' </p>

<p> Data about chronic cocaine users' crime rates are not as well
developed. Recent evidence from street and treatment setting
interviews with crack users indicate that about 60 percent admit
paying for their cocaine with money derived from illicit
sources-ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to theft and
robbery. The persons using cocaine, however, generally come from
more varied socioeconomic backgrounds than heroin users, their
lifestyles vary accordingly, and many do not ever get arrested.
Nevertheless, the lifestyles of cocaine abusers who do become
involved with the criminal justice system appear to be very
similar to those of heroin abusers, as cocaine users often also
use heroin. </p>

<h4><a name="CriminalJusticeResponse">The criminal justice
response </a></h4>

<p> While much remains to be learned about the precise nature of
the links betnveen doing drugs and doing crime, the two behaviors
are clearly associated. Yet criminal justice agencies have few
strategies for routinely detecting and intervening in the drug
use of arrested heroin and cocaine abusers. The justice system
focuses almost exclusively on its criminal processing functions
of arrest, adjudication, probation, incarceration, and parole.
Even these interventions often represent a limited intrusion on
the criminal activities of the drug abusing offender. </p>

<p> <b>Criminal justice agencies, with rare exceptions, do not
seek or use information about the drug use of persons who are
arrested or convicted of crimes.</b> </p>

<p> Littlc cffort is made to identify drug abusers, to record
information about their drug use, to provide treatment (other
than dctoxification) while in jail or prison, to refer them to
treatment programs in the community, or to use such information
in plea bargaining or case dispositions (where legally
appropriate). <b>Only </b>a few jurisdictions maintain any
information about the drug use of arrestees or convicted
offenders, and there is a strong likelihood that the drug
information in their records is both incomplete and inaccurate
because it is most often based on self-report and not
substantiated through urinalysis. Thus, information that could
help inform criminal justice processing is not generally
available.' </p>

<p> <b>To the extent that criminal sanctions are applied, their
ability to interrupt the life style of the vast majority of
cocainc-heroin abusers is minimal.</b> </p>

<p> Nationally, only a low percentage (less than 10 percent) of
all felony arrests lead to a felony conviction resulting in
incarceration. Over half of all felony arrests (60 percent in
Manhattan) lead to conviction, but there is much variation by
jurisdiction. Typically, offenders plead guilty to lesser charges
and are sentenced to time served, a fine, community service,
probation, or a few months in jail. Consequently, the vast
majority of offenders, mainly those arrested on less severe
felony and misdemeanor charges, are at liberty within three
months after arrest. In addition, many felony offenders (a
significant portion of whom are involved with drugs) are at
liberty on bail or on personal recognizance while awaiting trial.
Active heroin-cocaine users have higher failure-to-appear rates
and much higher rates of rearrest while out on bail than
offenders not involved with drugs.9 </p>

<h4><a name="EfficacyofCriminalSanctions">The efficacy of
criminal sanctions </a></h4>

<p> Little evidence is available that criminal justice sanctions
alone are as effective as drug treatment in reducing the drug use
and criminality of cocaineheroin abusers at liberty. The central
value of the criminal process may lie in the leverage that can be
exerted to bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment. </p>

<p> <b>Existing evidence does not show that criminal justice
sanctions (fine, probation, or parole, or length of time served)
reduce criminality or drug </b>use <b>more effectively than drug
treatment among cocaine-heroin abusers.</b> </p>

<p> It is not known whether or to what extent jail or prison time
alone suppresses post-incarceration criminality or cocaine-heroin
abuse among drug involved offenderq- The limited evidence
available suggests that two-thirds or <b>more </b>of arrested
heroin abusers return to heroin-cocaine use and their diverse
criminal patterns within three months after release from
detention. In contrast, several studies of drug treatment
outcomes with criminal justice clients (mainly probationers) show
substantial post-treatment reductions in both drug use and
criminality.10 Outpatient clients in methadone treatment report
less than half as much criminal activity as heroin abusers not in
treatment. Compared with their pretreatment criminality,
methadone clients report 50 to 80 percent less crime during
treatment.&quot; Even among those who continue criminal activity
during treatment, methadone clients report reduced involvement in
serious crimes such as robbery, burglary, or dealing of heroin or
cocaine; they report mainly low-level property crimes, con games,
and sale of marijuana or pills.&quot; </p>

<p> Residential drug programs have sizable proportions
(frequently over half) of clients who are on probation or parole
or under related <b>legal </b>pressure, and whose criminality is
near zero while in the residential program. This nearzero
criminality of cocaine-heroin abusers while in residential
programs is documented for therapeutic communities in several
cities. A study of treatment facilities in New York found that
about a third of residential clients were criminal justice
referrals and had extensive criminal histories. These clients
tended to stay longer and have as good or better outcomes than
clients with similar pretreatment criminal and drug abuse
histories who were not referred by the criminal justice system.
13 </p>

<p> <b>The coercive power, surveillance potential, and time
offcmd through criminal justice sanctions, open significant
opportunities for effectively treating cocaine-heroin abusers.</b>
</p>

<p> Although criminal justice sanctions alone may have uncertain
value in reducing the criminality of drug involved offenders,
those sanctions can serve a powerful role by facilitating
effective drug treatment. There are a variety of pressures that
bring hardcore drug abusers into treatment: parents, employers,
loved one, and friends may all apply psychological and social
pressures. The most powerful pressure, however, may be the threat
of legal sanction -- the threat of arrest and conviction, and
most importantly, the threat of incarceration. The leverage
created by this threat, and by the sanction itself, permits
treatment to be considered as a viable option by serious abusers.
Moreover, by reducing early program termination, it allows the
treatment and aftercare to continue for the length of the
permissable custody. </p>

<p> Cocaine-heroin abusers typically wish to avoid the
&quot;hassles&quot; associated with changing their lives. When
the alternative is lengthy incarceration, cocaine-heroin abusers
may be more willing to be referred to drug treatment. If,
however, the alternative is a short sentence, detainees and jail
inmates may prefer the incarceration rather than diversion to
long-term drug abuse treatment. </p>

<p> Unfortunately, relatively few offenders voluntarily seek
treatment. Many offenders are referred by the criminal justice
system to drug treatment as the result of negotiated plea
bargains in which the offender agrees to enter treatment instead
of receiving a substantial sentece. For many years TASC
(Treatment Alternatives to Street Crime) has operated in selected
jurisdictions to recruit clients and negotiate with court staff
for release of offenders to drug programs. TASC clients are more
likely to select treatment because the alternative is considered
more onerous. </p>

<p> Few cocaine-heroin abusers in custody volunteer for drug
treatment unless the treatment program is seen as an attractive
alternative. Prison inmates seek out in-house treatment programs
because they often provide better living conditions, a safer
environment, parole release considerations, and an opportunity to
possibly change one's lifestyle. In-prison programs that offer
such conditions are substantially better able to recruit
participants than those which do not. Although these offenders
may not be completely sincere at admission, there is an
opportunity for the program to engage them in an effective
treatment experience. In short, the threat of substantial
sanctions (for arrestees) or the promise of better in-prison
conditions (for those in custody) can operate as extremely useful
incentives for treatment. Nevertheless, it must be understood
that a significant portion of offenders who have long chronic
heroin or cocaine abuse patterns will not want treatment under
any circumstances. </p>

<h4><a name="Somedimensions">Some dimensions of effective drug
abuse treatment.</a> </h4>

<p> As the preceding section has demonstrated, the criminality of
heroin abusers is substantially reduced while they are receiving
some form of treatment. The experiences of effective programs
suggest that whatever treatment method is used must have a sound
theoretical and empirical basis for its implementation.
Additionally, the treatment method must emerge from a powerful
social restoration tradition (discussed further below) that is
capable of teaching offenders to interact with others in less
deviant, more socially acceptable ways. Such an approach must be
credible to participants and not be perceived to be coercive and
authoritarian. The approach must have the capability to convince
offenders that the demanding path to a socially acceptable
lifestyle is worthwhile despite their deprived backgrounds, their
experience with quick criminal profits, and their recognition
that there is a low probability they will be caught for their
crimes. </p>

<p> <b>Despite the often cited conclusion that &quot;nothing
works&quot;, evidence from the research literature continues to
accumulate that some programs have been successful in reducing
recidivism.&quot;</b> </p>

<p> The majority of successful programs have been based on a
social learning theory of criminal behavior.&quot; According to
this theory, criminal behavior is learned through a process of
social interaction with others. Thus, pro-social behaviors must
be learned to replace deviant behavior. Effective approaches
include: therapeutic communities, self-help groups, family
therapy, contingency contracting, role playing and modeling,
vocational and social skills training, training in interpersonal
cognitive problem-solving skills, and other programs involving
ongoing peer monitoring of participants' behavior.&quot; </p>

<p> Successful programs have several things in common: authority
structures that clearly specify rules and sanctions,
anti-criminal modeling and reinforcement of pro-social behavior,
pragmatic personal and social problemsolving assistance, program
staff knowledgeable about the use of community resources, and
relationships between staff and clients which are empathic and
characterized by open communication and trust. Ex-offender-addict
counselors who serve as credible role-models of successful
rehabilitation also are often utilized.&quot; The &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A) provides an example of a
successful program that employs these treatment principles. </p>

<p> Conversely, unsuccessful programs are frequently based on a
medical (disease) model of criminology which suggests that
criminal behavior is a sickness.'9 <b>Similarly, </b>intervention
programs based on deterrence models (e.g., &quot;Scared
Straight&quot;) have shown very limited effects and have even
been associated with increased offending.&quot;' Other types of
programs that have been unsuccessful include those that rely
solely on open communication, &quot;friendship&quot; models,
inmate-directed therapy groups, and those that are
non-directive.,, </p>

<p> While inmate-dircctcd therapy groups have not had a record of
success, behavioral programs that are simply imposed-without
involving inmates in their development-do not appear to work
either. Such programs are often focused on anti-social rather
than pro-social behaviors and as a result give undue attention
and reinforcement to negative behavior. Other features of
unsuccessful programs include the failure to either neutralize or
utilize the inmate's peer group and failure to sustain continuity
of care after release from prison. 22 </p>

<p> A number of factors have been identified that degrade
treatment integrity23 and impede treatment success. Many are
common to intervention pro grams in any setting. The absence of
sound theoretical basis for treatment is a typical obstacle to
the development of successful programs. Often, the quality and
intensity of treatment interventions are inadequate. Sometimes
programs propose treatment interventions that are based on sound
principles which are not followed when the program is
implemented. Another common problem is lack of staff training and
treatment experience, and/or their inadequate commitment to.both
the clients' and program success. </p>

<p> Other impediments to the establishment and maintenance of
successful treatment programs are related to a lack of
correctional system support and the negative influence of inmate
subcultures. Fundamental differences between custodial and
treatment perspectives often contribute to the failure of the
correctional environment to support program staff and goals, The
lack of support from the custodial forces of an institution is
exacerbated within prisons by the negative influence of the
anti-authoritarian and antitherapeutic &quot;prisoners'
code.&quot; Under this code, suspicion colors most interactions
between staff and inmates. The result may be a program that
receives neither staff support nor inmate cooperation. </p>

<p> <b>Time in community drug treatment is inversely related to
posttreatment cocaine-heroin abuse and criminality.</b> </p>

<p> Turning to a more quantitative dimension of treatment
programming, the available research clearly suggests the longer
heroin and cocaine abusers remain in treatment, the greater the
reduction in post-treatment criminality. Those who remain in
community-based residential, methadone, or outpatient programs
for more than three months have lower levels of both
post-treatment heroin and cocaine abuse and criminality than
those who drop out before three months and significantly lower
rates than their own pre-treatment levels. Subsequent months of
treatment in these programs yield even greater reductions in
post-treatment criminality, especially after 12 months of
treatment and after each subsequent treatment cycle. </p>

<p> Treatment personnel generally agree that it is hard even to
stabilize the cocaine-heroin abuser's lifestyle in three months,
much less begin to transform long-standing patterns of deviance.
After three months, clients can begin to be comfortable with the
treatment regime and start to make progress in changing
disruptive patterns in their lives. However, due to the chronic
relapsing pattern characteristic of the drug addict, several
&quot;cycles of treatment&quot; are frequently necessary for
hardcore drug abusers to achieve substantial improvement in their
behavior and lifestyle. </p>

<p> Clients who leave treatment early against program advice are
significantly more likely to recidivate than those who complete
the recommended program, Early leavers who later return to
treatment ultimately have less heroin use and criminality than
those who fail to return.&quot; </p>

<p> Outcome studies have shown that the first 12 months in
treatment are critical to long-term reductions in criminality
after leaving treatment. For cocaine and heroin abusers who are
incarcerated <b>and </b>who participate in prison-based
therapeutic community programs, the optimum period of treatment
appears to be nine to twelve months followed by release into the
community. Longer stays are associated with diminishing results.
It is believed this occurs for two reasons: First, longer periods
of program participation while in prison creates increased
dependency on the program and less transference of the learned
experiences to the community upon release. Secondly, some persons
are transferred as rehabilitated back into the general prison
population after completing more than a year of treatment, and
the criminal subculture undermines some gains made during the
treatment period. Thus, the timing of treatment and release for
prison inmateswith serious drug abuse problems needs to be
coordinated to achieve the optimum outcome </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> Clearly, much has been learned about effective ways of
reducing the drug involvement of heroin and cocaine abusing
offenders. Given the chronic recurring nature of addiction, no
program can realistically expect to eliminate severe heroin and
cocaine abuse for all offenders. Yet even if a program succeeds
only in reducing the frequency of use, substantial reductions in
criminality may follow. The evidence is clear: cocaine-heroin
abusers commit much less crime when they use once or twice a week
or less often than when they use once a day or more often. If,
for example, daily cocaine-heroin users were placed under
court-directed intensive surveillance and frequent urine
monitoring which curtailed their use of drugs by half or more, a
very substantial drop in their criminality'. would be likely to
occur, especially in crimes such as robbery and burglary- </p>

<h3><a name="PolicyRecommendations">Policy recommendations </a> </h3>

<p> What steps should be taken by the criminal justice system to
deal more effectively with the drug-involved offender? Based on
the research findings discussed in the preceding section and the
experience and opinions of <b>the </b>authors, this section
presents a series of policy recommendations. While it may not be
possible to institute all or even most of these recommendations
in many jurisdictions, they are offered as goals or guidelines
for the practitioner. We argue that the interventions proposed
will improve the system by leading to the effective integration
and coordination of offender supervision and drug treatment
approaches. </p>

<p> Beginning with the crucial need to identify heroin and
cocaine abusers at arrest, the recommendations focus in turn on
jail-based interventions, inprison programs, and community
treatment options. Also included are systemwide recommendations
pertaining to the organization and staffing of drug abuse
treatment programs. All of the recommendations presented in this
;ection call for the criminal justice system to supervise
cocaine-heroin users frequently and systematically: </p>

<p>  Convicted cocaine-heroin abusers under community
supervision should be intensively supervised and compelled to
attend treatment for their maximum period of custody. Optimal
supervision includes near daily validation of employment, time in
residence, associations, and absence of drug use. </p>

<p>  Convicted cocainc-hcroin abusers sentenced to prison
should be required to participate in drug treatment for nine
months to one year prior to release <i>and </i>to continue in
community treatment as a condition of parole. Their urine and
behavior should be carefully monitored while under field
supervision to insure attendance and prevent relapses.&quot; </p>

<p>  Steps should be taken to ensure that drug-involved
offenders in city and county detention facilities are placed in
treatment after release, During their confinement, methadone
maintenance should be continued for addicts previously assigned
to this program or initiated for other heroin users. Naltrexone
combined with urine surveillance should be used for those heroin
users on work release who opt for drug-frcc treatment. </p>

<h4><a name="identification">The identification of drug-involved
offenders </a></h4>

<p> <b>In areas with a large number of heroin and cocaine users,
urinalysis should be used to identify these users at arrest.</b> </p>

<p> Most cocaine-heroin abusers who have contact with the
criminal justice system are arrested about once per year. Results
of the pretrial drug-testing program operating in Washington,
D.C. suggest that recent users of cocaine or heroin can be
identified accurately at arrest through urinalysis. By collccting
urine samples from all arrestees, and analyzing the specimens for
five types of drugs including opiates, the D.C. Pretrial Services
Agency has been able to identify and increase supervision of drug
users released pen-ding trial. These procedures appear to have
reduced the rates of rearrest and failure-to-appear. Moreover, by
systematically retaining the results of the urine tests, the
information has been made available to help determine appropriate
criminal sanctions for those arrestces ultimately
convicted.&quot; </p>

<p> The costs of a urine testing program may be amply justified
in any jurisdiction with a significant drug problem. As in D.C.,
the data collected should be systematically maintained and used
for determining conditions of pre-trial release and sanctions for
those convicted. In particular, the opportunity should be seized
to present appropriate treatment options. </p>

<h4><a name="jailbased">Jail-based interventions </a></h4>

<p> <b>Treatment orientation and referral to drug treatment
programs should </b>be <b>instituted </b>in <b>metropolitan
courts and jails.</b> </p>

<p> A central intake staff and/or representatives of drug
treatment programs should be present at court and in jails. All
offenders who test drug positive at arrest should be required to
attend orientation and preliminary intake procedures while in
detention. These preliminary treatment steps may help ensure that
those who are released from custody are placed in appropriate
treatment after returning to the community.&quot; </p>

<p> Full treatment interventions, however, should not be
initiated for cocaineheroin offenders who will be free of custody
in less than three months. It is neither cost effective nor
therapeutically wise to implement full treatment programming when
there is little expectation that treatment can be completed. </p>

<p> <b>Methadone programs should be permitted to maintain clients
in jails to facilitate resumption of treatment at the end of
detention.</b> </p>

<p> Methadone treatment has proven effective in reducing daily
heroin use and substantially reducing criminality among heroin
abusers. Enrolled methadone clients who are arrested can be
maintained on methadone while detained. In this way, return to
methadone treatment upon release after short-term jail custody
would be facilitated. Those who are convicted and sentenced to
incarceration should be given the option (when medically
recommended) to remain on methadone or to detoxify from methadone
and enter an in-prison therapeutic community. Consideration
should also be given to initiating methadone treatment in jails
for chronic heroin addicts. Heroin addicts serving short
sentences who arc introduced to methadone treatment while
incarcerated are more likely to enter and remain in methadone
maintenance treatment in the community when they are released
from custody. </p>

<p> <b>Daily naltrexone consumption should be used for some
convicted heroin abusers in combination with drug-free treatment
and intensive supervision.</b> </p>

<p> <i>For her-oin-abusing </i>offenders who receive jail or
probation sentences <i>and </i>who opt for drug-free treatment,
use of naltrexone (Trexan@), combined with urine surveillance,
could be instituted. Its use with jail inmates on work release or
school furlough appears particularly appropriate. Naltrexone is
an easily administered narcotic antagonist drug which taken daily
produces almost immediate withdrawal symptoms in addicts when
they use an opiatc, but is harmless to nonaddicts. It is most
effective with heroinaddicted offenders who have a high level of
community integration. It has no effect on cocaine, however;
therefore, urine monitoring <i>must be </i>sustained.'o </p>

<h4><a name="inprison">In-prison treatment </a></h4>

<p> <b>Therapeutic communities and other intensive milieu drug
treatments should be made available to cocaine-heroin abusing
state prisoners about one year prior to parole eligibility.</b> </p>

<p> A successful therapeutic community, the &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; program (see Appendix A), was developed at two
correctional facilities in New York Stateone for men and one for
women. This model therapeutic community in prison holds the
greatest promise for changing hard-core, drug-abusing inmates and
reducing recidivism.&quot; </p>

<p> Despite their proven effectiveness, few therapeutic
communities such as &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; are in place for
criminally involved drug abusers. One of the factors that limits
the creation of additional programs of this type is the concern
that such programs might engage in activities that threaten
security and encourage inmate resistance to the correctional
system. Nonetheless, correctional administrators learn quickly as
they become exposed to the operation of well-run programs that
such undesirable variance can be avoided. In fact, in
institutions where most of these programs have been established,
the wardens and correctional officers frequently are their most
vocal champions. To encourage their development, however, staff
and administration need education and training. Further, a number
of fiscal and practical issues have to be addressed prior to
implementation- </p>

<p> <b>The implementation of prison-based treatment programs
requires isolation from the general prison population.</b> </p>

<p> The inimical influence of the criminal inmate subculture
(&quot;prisoners' code&quot;) will inevitably undermine any
attempts to establish viable programming if the program is not
isolated from this anti-therapeutic force. Separate living
quarters, recreation, food services, etc. should be maintained
within the institution for this separation to be ideally
effective. Total isolation is, however, neither necessary nor
desirable; rather, some contact with the general inmate
population is useful for the purpose of allowing the inmate in
treatment to see where he has come from and how much he has
changed. In addition, the contact experience provides the
opportunity for the program resident to test both his new
prosocial values against the inmate subculture and his resistance
to negative influences. This kind of isolation is most possible
in medium security institutions with dormitorytype housing space
where one dormitory or two are physically segregated or separable
from the main institution. </p>

<p> <b>Prisoners in therapeutic communities who make good
treatment progress should be paroled to residential drug-free
programs that sustain the therapeutic community model prior to
completion of (heir sentence. They should be required to stay in
treatment as a condition of parole until their date of maximum
custody or until the program deems them recovered.</b> </p>

<p> It is essential for the successful treatment of
cocaine-heroin abuser offenders to maintain continuity-of-care
from the outset of treatment to termination of custody. While
there is benefit from prison treatment alone, these effects are
augmented and sustained by continuing that specific treat inent
in the community. </p>

<p> Ideally, release to the community facility would be
contingent on the progress made during in-prison treatment. Under
this incentive system, specific behaviors would be rewarded with
a specified number of restitution or release &quot;points&quot;
that might be administered as a form of &quot;good timc&quot;
system. Alternatively, prisoners might earn more favorable
conditions of confinement or higher status and associated program
privilege.-,. However it is administered, the basic notion is to
reinforce <b>the </b>desirability of pro-social behaviors. </p>

<h4><a name="community">Community treatment programs </a></h4>

<p> <b>Drug-abusing misdemennants should be considered for
communitybased sentencing alternatives.</b> </p>

<p> In lieu of confining drug-involved offenders in jails and
county penitentiaries, a range of intermediate sanctions should
be considered for heroin and cocaine abusers convicted of
misdemeanors. These might include house arrest with electronic
monitoring, intermittent sentences (e.g., weekend or evening
incarceration), TASC programs, or residence in a facility such as
a &quot;halfway in-halfway out&quot; center (a &quot;HiHo&quot;).
Again, in any of these alternatives offenders would ideally be
able to achieve release status more quickly by providing
drug-negative urine samples, routinely attending and
participating positively in treatment sessi ns, paying back their
victims, and providing evidence of prosocial activity.'2 </p>

<p> The community treatment resources available to support
intermediate sanctioning policies range from self-help groups
that meet once a week for a couple of hours to residential
facilities that provide 24 hour supervision and programming- At a
minimum, almost all communities have an Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous group that provides an context for recovering
substance abusers to meet, discuss day-to-day steps for
maintaining a drug free life, and participate in many different
types of social activities not involving alcohol or drugs.&quot;
Some communities provide drug treatment counseling through the
Department of Mental Health. And in many cities, recovering
substance-abusers operate group homes that use many of the same
principles of Alcoholics Anonymous or therapeutic communities
found in prison programs. </p>

<p> TASC programs run throughout the nation provide staff who are
familiar with the particular resources available for
drug-involved offenders in specific communities. And almost all
states have an agency that periodically determines the
availability of both private and public programs available for
drug treatment. <b>A </b>list of these agencies is available from
the National Association of State Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Directors, in Washington, DC </p>

<p> <b>Even if no other treatment is provided, heroin-cocaine
abusers who are on probation and parole should be required to
have frequent urine tests.</b> </p>

<p> Drug-abusing offenders on probation or parole who are in no
special treatment programs, as a minimum should be routinely
required to provide specimens for urinalysis over the entire
length of their probation or parole. At the outset the frequency
of urinalysis should be near daily, and decreascd as positive
progress warrants. The effective monitoring of urinalysis results
will help to interrupt relapse to daily heroin or cocaine use,
and, hence, high-rate criminality is likely to drop
substantially.&quot; When drug positive urines are detected,
offenders should be immediately confronted, clearly warned after
the first such incident, be required to enter treatment for
diagnosis and assessment after the second positive urine, and be
required to remain in treatment if relapse seems imminent or has
occurred. Refusal to enter treatment upon an affirmative
diagnosis should be considered a violation of release conditions.
</p>

<h4><a name="organization">Organization and staffing issues </a> </h4>

<p> <b>The integrity of the treatment programs for convicted
offenders must be maintained by developing structural safeguards
of independence and autonomy from correctional management.</b> </p>

<p> All too often well designed interventions operated by
competent and motivated agency and institutional staffs do not
succeed. Usually, the efforts arc not trusted by the criminal
justice clients, are overwhelmed by the difficulty of the
clients' problems, are weakened by inadequate funding and
institutional resistance, and are subject to high rates of staff
burnout and turnover. For a treatment program to last long enough
to make a substantial difference, it must maintain its own
integrity, ie., honesty and commitment to the treatment goals and
program participants. The staff must also have sufficient
independence and automony to deliver on their promises. </p>

<p> Treatment programs conducted by organizations independent of
(but closely linked to) corrections agencies are more likely to
maintain their integrity thz programs operated by correctional
staff within institutions or community corrections settings. This
suggests that an outside agency working in cooperation with or
under contract to the Department of Corrections may be the most
appropriate treatment organization. Management responsibility for
the rehabilitation program should be assigned to a team of
committed treatment professionals, as well as
ex-addict/ex-offender peer counselors, For this approach to work,
the power and authority of the treatment team should be
comparable to and complement the criminal justice authority. This
management group should be associated with and monitored by
respected professional self-help/therapeutic community
organizations, for example, Therapeutic Communities of America. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole officers should have their functions
divided into Surveillance Officers and Community 'fteatment Team
Leaders.</b> </p>

<p> For many years, correctional observers have debated the
wisdom of vesting probation and parole officers with the
potentially conflicting responsibilities of surveillance and
treatment. In the opinion of the authors, surveillance and
treatment functions of field supervision officers should be
separated to resolve the inherent conflicts and strengthen each
function. Essential to the effectiveness of the
treatment/counseling relationship is trust and confidentiality.
Persons tinder field supervision are unlikely to freely admit
criminal acts or drug use to someone in a position to return them
to prison for such violations. Therefore, surveillance and
rehabilitation responsibilities should be handled by staffs who
work separately but cooperatively to avoid role confusion for
both officer and offender. As the next recommendation suggests,
both types of officers should be augmented by carefully selected
exoffeiider-addicts who would serve as Monitors for the
Surveillance Officers and as Treatment Team staff for the
Community Treatment Team Leader. </p>

<p> The Treatment Team staff should rotate between working in
prison and the community to maintain continuity between the
rehabilitation efforts in both environments. For in-prison
programs, the objective of separating custodial and treatment
functions is satisfied by the organization discussed in the
preceding point. </p>

<p> <b>Former addict-offenders who have shown clear evidence of
prosocial change should have training and employment
opportunities, for example, as Monitors and Rntment Team members.</b>
</p>

<p> Large numbers of offenders who have been chronic
cocaine-heroin abusers are unable to gain and to keels legal
employment. Their background is so limited and so stigmatized
that legal employers are reluctant to employ them, and suspicious
after they do. Thus, even after making good treatment progress,
many offenders may still be unable to gain stable employment.
First, systematic skill development and training programs should
he providcd. Second, providing employment to ex-addict-offenders
within the treatment program itself is a valuable opportunity to
deal with this unemployment issue as well as cope with shortages
of field supervision personnel. </p>

<p> The employment of ex-addict-offenders in a variety of
progressively more responsible paraprofessional and professional
rolcs will help new monitoring and drug treatment systems
function effectively. They also will serve as role models to
offenders they supervise. The ex-addict offenders are the role
models (as in &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;) whose presence
demonstrates the realistic possibility of achieving successful
rehabilitation. Graduation from a drug treatment program,
evidence of successful integration into community life, and
additional training are prerequisites for the employment of
ex-addictoffenders as Monitors and Treatriient Team members. </p>

<h4><a name="Conclusion2">Conclusion</a> </h4>

<p> By substantially reducing their cocaine-heroin abuse, the
criminality of drug-involved offenders may be reduced by 20 to 50
percent or more. To do so, however, the criminal justice system
must develop an alliance with the drug treatment system geared to
achieve the goals of effective rehabilitation, enhanced prosocial
behavior, and reduced recidivism. </p>

<p> The difficulties inherent in bringing about this alliance
should not be minimizcd. Some reallocation of resources clearly
will be required, with all the tensions attendant on any
significant shift in funding and operational priorities. If
custodial and treatment functions are to be effectively
separated, recruitment, training, and retraining programs will
have to be developed for community corrections personnel.
Institutional corrections environments must be prepared to accept
independent treatment organizations. Procedures must be developed
to identify and train those therapeutic community graduates best
qualified to become competent treatment team members and
monitors. The problem of intensive community resistance to
accepting community treatment facilities (HiHo's) that house
felons and substance abusers must also be addressed. Within
prisons, space will have to be reallocated to create therapeutic
communities to house clients during treatment. If institutions
are converted for total therapeutic community utilization,
abandoned mental hospitals may be utilized, with significant
capital expenditures necessary for conversion. Beginning at the
point of arrest, screening procedures will have to be developed
to monitor drug use and to identify cocaine-heroin users who can
most benefit from the proposed interventions. </p>

<p> Perhaps most important, cooperation will be needed among
stable drug abuse agencies and drug treatment programs and
criminal justice organizations (courts, probation, corrections,
and parole) that traditionally have had competing political and
fiscal interests and often lack a history of successful Joint
ventures. Careful documentation of pilot results will also be
needed to evaluate whether the system is moving in desired or
unanticipated directions. For this, evaluation researchers will
have to be in place from the outset. Since many problems will
arise that have the potential for compromising the interventions,
the evaluation design must provide decision makers with timcly
information to assist them in formulating corrective actions. At
the same time, ongoing dissemination of outcome information
through professional and media channels will help foster and
maintain the support necessary to accomplish the changes
proposed. </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;: A model for prison-based drug
treatment </p>

<p> &quot;Stay 'N <b>Out&quot; </b>is a therapeutic community
(TC), in part based upon the Phoenix House model, that has been
operating in the New York State prison system for the last ten
years. Over time the program has been modified to operate more
effectively within the prison environment. The program has been
fortunate to be operated by many of the founding staff who have
provided the vision, commitment, and determination necessary for
a successful prison program. </p>

<p> An early evaluation of the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; program
indicated that it was successfully implemented, maintained a
positive TC environment, and produced positive psychological and
behavioral changes in participants. In 1984, the National
Institute <b>on </b>Drug Abuse funded an evaluation of &quot;Stay
'N Out&quot;, comparing it to two other prison-bascd programs in
New York State and a control group of inmates on program waiting
lists, but receiving no treatment. A milieu program and a
standard counseling program were the comparison groups. Although
participants were not randomly assigned to thcsc treatment
conditions, preliminary results of the comparison are
provocative. The data indicate the &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program for nine to twelve
months were less likely to have problems while on parole than
either those who left &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot; earlier or those in
other prison-based programs. For example, &quot;Stay 'N Out&quot;
participants who remained in the program more than nine months
were more likely to have a positive parole discharge (80 percent
positive) than those who remained in the program less than three
months (50 percent positive). Positiv e parole discharge is
defined as no reported violations of parole during the parole
custody period. Long-term (9-12 months) participants of the other
programs studied also had fewer cases of positive parole
discharge; the milieu program reported a 56 percent positive
discharge rate and the counseling program a 47 percent positive
rate. </p>

<p> Preliminary analysis indicates that long-term &quot;Stay 'N
Out&quot; participants may also have a more encouraging pattern
of re-arrest than those in the other programs. Continuing
follow-up shows that only 27 percent of the TC participants were
re-arrested compared to 35 percent of the milieu participants, 50
percent of the counseling participants, and 42 percent of the
waiting list persons. In addition, TC participants averaged 18
months to rearrest compared to 11 months for the milieu and nine
months for the counseling group. These data should be interpreted
with caution, however, as variation in the actual number of days
at risk may vary greatly among samples. </p>

<h4><a name="overview">Program overview </a></h4>

<p> 64 Stay IN Out&quot; programs were begun as a joint effort
among New York </p>

<p> State Division of Substance Abuse Services (DSAS), New York
Therapeutic Communities (NYTC), New York Department of
Correctional Services (DOCS), and the New York State Division of
Parole. Currently, NYTC. operates the programs, DOCS supplies
funding, and Parole provides increased opportunities for program
residents. The DSAS Bureau of Research and Evaluation continues
to evaluate the program. </p>

<p> The current program consists of two treatment units for male
inmates in one facility with 35 beds per unit (a total capacity
of 70 beds), and one treatment unit with 40 beds for women
-inmates in another facility. Each unit is staffed by a total of
seven persons, including both professionals and
paraprofessionals. Inmates selected for the programs are
recruited at Statc correctional facilities. The criteria for
selection are: history of drug abuse, at least 18 years of age,
evidence of positive institutional participation, and no history
of sex crimes or mental illness. &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; clients
are housed in units segregated from the general prison
population. They cat in a common dining room, however, and attend
morning activities with other prisoners. The optimum length of
treatment is from nine to twelve months. Most program staff are
ex-addict-offenders who are graduates of community T)Cs: they act
as &quot;role models&quot; exemplifying successful
rehabilitation. The course of treatment is a developmental growth
process with the inmate becoming an increasingly responsible
member of the program. </p>

<p> During the early phase of treatment, the clinical thrust
involves assessment of client needs and problem areas.
Orientation to the prison TC procedures occurs through individual
counseling, encounter sessions, and seminars. Clients are given
low-level jobs and granted little status. During the later phases
of treatment, residents are provided opportunities to earn
higherlevel positions and increased status through sincere
involvement in the program and hard work. Encounter groups and
counseling sessions are more in-depth and focus on the areas of
self-discipline, self-worth, selfawareness, respect for
authority, and acceptance of guidance for problem areas. Seminars
take on a more intellectual nature. Debate is encouraged to
enhance self-expression and to increase self-confidence. </p>

<p> Ilpon release, participants are encouraged to seek further
substance abuse treatment at cooperating community TCs. Extensive
involvement with a network of community TCs is central to the
program's operation. Staff and senior residents of community TCs
visit &quot;Stay IN Out&quot; on a regular basis to recruit
resident inmates for their programs. These visitors provide
inspiration since they are ex-addicts and ex-felon role models
who are leading economically and socially productive lives. </p>

<p> <b>DRUG OFFENSES ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF JAIL
INMATES</b> </p>

<h1><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h1>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C.-- Drug offenses accounted for 23 percent of </p>

<p> the charges against the almost 400,000 men and women being
held in </p>

<p> local jails during 1989--up from 9 percent in 1983, the
Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Statistics announced today. The Bureau, a component
of the </p>

<p> Office of Justice Programs in the U.S. Department of Justice,
reported </p>

<p> that the number of inmates in the nation's 3,312 local jails
grew 77 </p>

<p> percent from 1983 to 1989. More than 40 percent of that
growth </p>

<p> resulted from the increased number of persons held for or
convicted of </p>

<p> drug offenses. </p>

<p> &quot;The dramatic increase in the number of persons in jails
on </p>

<p> drug charges occurred both among those awaiting trial and
those </p>

<p> already convicted of crimes,&quot; said Bureau Director
Steven D. </p>

<p> Dillingham. &quot;And more than one-half of all convicted
jail inmates </p>

<p> said they had committed the offense for which they were
incarcerated </p>

<p> under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both.&quot; </p>

<p> The findings were drawn from a nationally representative </p>

<p> survey of 5,675 inmates held in 424 local jails. Similar
Bureau </p>

<p> surveys of jail inmates were conducted in 1972, 1978 and
1983. A jail </p>

<p> is a locally administered institution that holds people
awaiting trial </p>

<p> or already sentenced, usually for one year or less. </p>

<p> About half of all jail inmates in 1989 had been convicted and
</p>

<p> were serving time, 7 percent had been convicted but not yet
sentenced, </p>

<p> 26 percent were awaiting or on trial and 16 percent were
awaiting </p>

<p> arraignment. </p>

<p> An estimated 46 percent of the jail inmates in 1989 were on </p>

<p> probation, on parole, on bail or were in some other criminal
justice </p>

<p> status at the time of their arrest. More than three-quarters
of all </p>

<p> inmates being held in 1989 for any offense had had a prior
sentence of </p>

<p> probation or incarceration. At least a third of the inmates
were in </p>

<p> jail for a violent offense or had been previously sentenced
for a </p>

<p> violent offense. Other survey results: </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 convicted inmates said they had </p>

<p> been using an illegal drug during the month before they
committed the </p>

<p> offense for which they were incarcerated. About one in four
convicted </p>

<p> inmates said they had used a major drug, such as heroin,
cocaine, </p>

<p> crack, LSD or PCP, in that month. </p>

<p> --Women and Hispanic prisoners were the most likely among all
</p>

<p> jail inmates to be held on drug charges--about one-third in
each </p>

<p> group. </p>

<p> --Among convicted inmates, 29 percent reported they had </p>

<p> committed their offenses under the influence of only alcohol,
15 </p>

<p> percent under the influence of only drugs and 12 percent
under the </p>

<p> influence of both. </p>

<p> --Almost one-third of all jail inmates said they had </p>

<p> participated in a substance abuse treatment program at some
time in </p>

<p> their lives--about 18 percent of the inmates had received
treatment </p>

<p> for drugs, 9 percent for alcohol and 6 percent for both. </p>

<p> --More than four of every 10 female inmates reported they had
</p>

<p> been abused at some time before their current
incarceration--33 </p>

<p> percent physically and 36 percent sexually. </p>

<p> --About 39 percent of all jail inmates had grown up in a </p>

<p> single parent household and an additional 11 percent had
lived in a </p>

<p> household without either parent. </p>

<p> --The racial and ethnic composition of local jails changed </p>

<p> between 1983 and 1989--blacks increased from 38 percent to 42
percent </p>

<p> of the inmates population, Hispanics increased from 14
percent to 17 </p>

<p> percent and the percentage of white non-Hispanics decreased
from 46 </p>

<p> percent to 39 percent. </p>

<p> --The female jail population increased from 7.1 percent in </p>

<p> 1983 to 9.5 percent in 1989. One of every four female inmates
was in </p>

<p> jail for larceny or fraud. </p>

<p> --About 11 percent of the inmates were being held for other </p>

<p> authorities--most awaiting transportation to a state prison. </p>

<p> --Among the inmates who had been sentenced to serve their
time </p>

<p> in local jails, half had received a sentence of six months of
less. </p>

<p> It is estimated that about half of the inmates sentenced to
local </p>

<p> jails would serve less than five months. </p>

<p> DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 28 CFR Part 93 </p>

<p> Office of Justice Programs [OJP No. 1014] </p>

<p> January 26, 1995 RIN 1121-AA26 </p>

<h3>Drug Courts </h3>

<p> AGENCY: U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice
Programs. </p>

<p> ACTION: Proposed Rule. </p>

<p> SUMMARY: This notice announces a proposed rule and requests
comments on the Drug Court Program as authorized by Title V of
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. This
rule gives general guidance regarding the program and
specifically delineates the prohibition on participation by
violent offenders. Detailed program guidelines and application
materials for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug Court Program will be
available in early 1995. </p>

<p> DATE: All comments must be received by February 24, 1995. </p>

<p> ADDRESS: All comments should be addressed to Reginald L.
Robinson, <i>Deputy Assistant Attorney</i> <i>General, </i>Office
of Justice Programs, 633 Indiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20531. </p>

<p> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </p>

<p> The Department of Justice Response Center at 1-800-421-6770
or 202-307-1480. </p>

<p> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </p>

<p> Overview of Title V-Drug Courts </p>

<p> Federal discretionary grants are being made available under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Title
V, Public Law 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796 (September 13, 1994), 42
U.S.C. 3796ii-3796ii-8 [hereinafter the &quot;Act&quot;] to
States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, and
state and local courts for assistance with drug court programs.
The Act gives the Attorney General, and through statutory
authority contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act, an authorized designee (in this case the Assistant Attorney
General for the Office of Justice Programs), the authority to
make grants to the above-mentioned entities for drug court
programs that involve continuing judicial supervision over
non-violent offenders with substance abuse problems and the
integrated administration of sanctions and services including:
(1) mandatory periodic testing for, the use of controlled
substances or other addictive substances during any period of
supervised release or probation for each participant; (2)
substance abuse treatment for each participant; (3) diversion,
probation, or other supervised release involving the possibility
of prosecution, confinement, or incarceration based on
noncompliance with program requirements or failure to show
satisfactory progress; and (4) programmatic, offender management,
and aftercare services such as relapse prevention, health care,
education, vocational training, job placement, housing placement,
and,child care or other family support services for each
participant requiring such services. </p>

<p> Section 50001 of Title V of the Act requires that regulations
be issued to ensure exclusion of violent offenders from these
funded programs. This proposed rule responds to that requirement.
To more fully develop and define the grant program and to provide
direction and guidance to potential applicants, program
guidelines, will be issued subsequent to the publication of this
proposed rule. This Supplementary Information section is
intended, in part, to elicit comment on a broad range of issues
relevant to the development and implementation of those program
guidelines. </p>

<p> <b>Statement of the Problem</b> </p>

<p> More than half of all individuals brought into the criminal
justice system have substance abuse problems. Many of these
individuals are non-violent offenders who repeatedly cycle
through the court, corrections, and probation systems without
help to change their behavior. The underlying problem of such
non-violent substance abusing offenders frustrates and inhibits
judicial effectiveness. All too often, the non-violent drug
offender faces little certainty of punishment and represents a
long-term, recurring problem for both the criminal justice system
and society. </p>

<p> In too many cases, the criminal justice system fails to
subject non-violent, drug abusing offenders to intervention
measures that provide the mix of services and sanctions necessary
to change their behavior, or if necessary, coerce abstinence.
Some courts and prosecutors, however, have cost-effcctively
addressed the problem through the use of treatment drug courts.
Their results suggest that &quot;drug courts&quot; can
significantly enhance the offender's opportunity to break the
cycle of substance abuse and crime. Those who are coming into
contact with the criminal justice system for the first time may
be particularly susceptible to effective early intervention. </p>

<p> Indeed, research and evaluation demonstrate that the
&quot;drug court&quot; approach is effective in reducing both
drug abuse and drug-related crime. The Drug Court discretionary
grant program of Title V seeks to support the development of
innovative measures that provide courts additional resources to
assure certainty of punishment for drug abusing offenders through
the integrated administration of services and sanctions,
including close supervision and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> <b>The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994</b>
</p>

<p> The Department of Justice (Department) recognizes that no
single model exists for an effective drug court. To the contrary,
the Department believes there may be a variety of valid
approaches that deal effectively with non-violent offenders with
substance abuse problems. Consequently, the Drug Court grant
program will maintain flexibility in providing funds to support
the development of a variety of initiatives that coordinate
treatment and coerced abstinence. </p>

<p> The Department also recognizes the great diversity in the
structure and operation of state and local courts and criminal
justice systems. Hence, the Department is committed to a flexible
approach that allows jurisdictions to tailor local initiatives to
best suit their needs and local conditions. Program flexibility,
however, is<b> </b>necessarily balanced by statutory requirements
concerning the design and administration of the funded programs.
Accordingly, Drug Court programs that receive grant awards must: </p>

<ul>
    <li>exclude violent offenders from program participation; </li>
    <li>include a long-term strategy and detailed
        implementation.plan; </li>
    <li>explain the applicant's inability to fund the program
        adequately without Federal assistance; </li>
    <li>use Federal support to supplement, and not supplant,
        State, Indian tribal, and local sources of funding that
        would otherwise be available; </li>
    <li>identify related governmental or community initiatives
        which complement or will be coordinated with the
        proposal; </li>
    <li>consult with all affected agencies and insure that there
        will be appropriate coordination with all, affected
        agencies in the implementation of the program; </li>
    <li>certify, that participating offenders will receive
        continuing judicial supervision by one or more designated
        judges with responsibility for the drug court program; </li>
    <li>specify plans for obtaining necessary support and
        continuing the proposed program following the conclusion
        of Federal support; and </li>
    <li>describe the methodology that will be used in evaluating
        the program. </li>
</ul>

<p> Consistent with Congressional intent, program evaluation will
be crucial. Grant recipients will be required to cooperate with a
national evaluation team throughout their involvement with the
program. Recipients will also be required to provide for
independent evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of their
funded programs. The following issues will be especially
important in determining whether programs receiving grants under
this initiative are effective: (1) reduction in recidivism rates
of program participants, (2) maintenance of acceptable substance
abuse treatment completion rates among program participants, (3)
decreased drug use by program participants, and (4) maintenance
of a cost effective program in relation to the overall criminal
justice system. </p>

<p> <b>FY 1995 Drug Court Initiative</b> </p>

<p> The Fiscal Year 1995 Department of Justice Appropriations
Act, Public Law 103-317, has allocated $29 million for the Drug
Court grant programs. Eligibility of applicants to receive grants
will be based on requirements of the statute and these
regulations, as well as assurances and certifications specified
in detailed program guidelines and application materials that
will be available in early 1995 for the Fiscal Year 1995 Drug
Court initiative. </p>

<p> While detailed program guidelines will follow the publication
of this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department has made
some broad programmatic decisions upon which it welcomes comment.
Three types of funding will be available under this program
during Fiscal Year 1995. First, planning funding will be
available for those jurisdictions that express interest in
initiating a drug court but have not engaged in the comprehensive
planning necessary to make such a program successful. Second,
jurisdictions currently operating drug court programs may seek
funding to expand enhalace, or augment these ongoing efforts.
Finally, for those jurisdictions that have engaged (or are
currently engaged) in a comprehensive drug court planning
process, funding may be available to implement the plans their
efforts have produced. </p>

<p> <b>Call For Comments Concerning The Drug Court Initiative</b>
</p>

<p> Substance abuse-related offender case management is primarily
a state and local issue; thus, the Drug Court grant program
contemplates collaboration between federal and state and local
agencies. State and local government officials were involved in
Congressional hearings and meetings that guided the development
of this legislation and will continue to be involved as the
Department moves forward in developing this regulation,
establishing policy guidance, and implementing program
guidelines. At this time, comments are welcome regarding the
basic program design requirements described in Section 93.4 of
the proposed rule and to the entire scope of the program. </p>

<p>THE NATION'S PRISON POPULATION GREW ALMOST 9 PERCENT LAST YEAR
</p>

<p> U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EDT BJS </p>

<p> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1995 202/307-0784 </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's state and federal prisons
had to find room for 83,294 more inmates last year--the second
largest annual increase in history and just 1,470 fewer than the
84,764 increase recorded in 1989. The total number of men and
women in prison last December 31 was 1,053,738--a new record.
Overall, almost 1.5 million people were incarcerated in the
United States in 1994. State and federal prisons, which primarily
hold convicted felons serving longer sentences, contained about
two-thirds of the total. Locally operated jails, which primarily
hold people awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or
less, held the other third. </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 state prisons held 958,704 men and women
and federal prisons held 95,034 inmates. California (125,605) and
Texas (118,195) together held more than one in every five inmates
in the nation. Seventeen states, each holding fewer than 5,000
inmates, accounted for 4 percent of all prisoners. </p>

<p> Prison populations increased by at least 10 percent in 16
states last year. Texas reported the largest growth (28 percent),
followed by Georgia (20 percent). Alaska and </p>

<p> Connecticut reported fewer prisoners who had been sentenced
to more than a year. </p>

<p> The average sentence length and time served for state
prisoners has remained stable in recent years. Between 1985 and
1992, the years for which comparable data are available, half of
the state prisoners served at least 48 months. </p>

<p> In the federal system, however, the &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
have contributed to increasing the median time served in prison
from 15 months in 1986 to 24 months in 1992. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate for prisoners sentenced to more than a
year reached a record 387 per 100,000 U.S. residents last
December 31. States with the highest incarceration rates were
Texas (636 inmates per 100,000 residents), Louisiana (530) and
Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had the lowest, followed by
Minnesota (100) and West Virginia (106). </p>

<p> Since 1980 per capita incarceration rates rose the most in
the South (from 188 to 451) and West (from 105 to 333). The rate
in the Northeast rose from 87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest
from 109 to 297. </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, violent offenders were the greatest
contributors to state prison inmate growth. Between 1980 and
1993, the number of violent offenders grew by an estimated
221,300, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) estimated using
1993 data. </p>

<p> More than a quarter of the state and federal inmates were in
prison for drug offenses (234,600 prisoners) in 1993. Prisoners
serving a drug sentence increased from 8 percent of the state and
federal prison population in 1980 to 26 percent in 1993. In
federal prisons, inmates sentenced for drug law violations were
the single largest group--60 percent in 1993, up from 25 percent
in 1980. </p>

<p> At the end of the year, states reported they were operating
between 17 percent and 29 percent over capacity, while the
federal system was operating at 25 percent over capacity. </p>

<p> Because of prison construction and the creation of new prison
beds, the ratio of the inmate population to the capacity of state
prisons has remained almost the same since 1990. </p>

<p> The average growth in the number of state and federal
prisoners sentenced to at least a year's incarceration was equal
to the need for 1,542 more beds per week in 1994. </p>

<p> During 1994 almost 5 percent of all state prisoners--48,949
inmates in 21 jurisdictions--were held in local jails or other
facilities because of prison crowding. </p>

<p> The number of female inmates grew 10.6 percent last year,
compared to an 8.5 percent increase among male inmates. On
December 31, 1994, there were 64,403 women in state and federal
prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The rate of incarceration
for inmates serving a sentence of more than a year is 746 males
per 100,000 U.S. male residents, vs. 45 females per 100,000
female population. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1993, the number of white and black female
inmates grew at a faster pace than the number of male inmates in
either racial group. During this period the number of white males
grew 163 percent, the number of black males grew 217 percent, the
number of white females 327 percent, and the number of black
females 343 percent. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The report, &quot;Prisoners in 1994&quot; (NCJ-151654), was
written by BJS statisticians Allen J. Beck and Darrell K.
Gilliard. Single copies may be obtained from the BJS

<h2>STATE AND FEDERAL PRISON POPULATION TOPS ONE MILLION </h2>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The nation's prison population exceeds 1
million for the first time in history, the Department of Justice
announced today. At the end of June, 1,012,851 men and women were
incarcerated in state and federal prisons. State prisons held
919,143 inmates and federal prisons held 93,708 inmates.
California (124,813) and Texas (100,136) together accounted for
more than one in five inmates in the country. </p>

<p> The prison population grew by almost 40,000 inmates during
the first half of 1994, the equivalent of more than 1,500 a
week--or three additional 500-bed prisons. </p>

<p> During the last 12 months the prison population expanded by
more than 71,000, the second largest annual increase ever
recorded. This growth was slightly greater than the annual growth
in the preceding 12 months (69,525) and exceeds by 11 percent the
average annual growth (63,793) during the previous five years,
that is from July 1988 to June 1993. </p>

<p> The incarceration rate of state and federal prisoners
sentenced to more than a year reached a record 373 prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents last June. The states with the highest
incarceration rates were Texas (545 per 100,000), Louisiana
(514), South Carolina (504) and Oklahoma (501). </p>

<p> During the 12 months preceding June 30, 1994, eleven states
recorded prisoner growth rates of 10 percent or more, led by
Connecticut (20 percent), Texas (18 percent), and Tennessee (15
percent). </p>

<p> In the last decade the U.S. prison population doubled on a
per capita basis. During this 10-year period, the incarceration
rate doubled both for white inmates and black inmates. At the end
of last year (the latest available data) there were 1,432 black
inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents and 203 white inmates
per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<p> During the first six months of 1994, the number of female
inmates grew 6.2 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent increase
among male inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, there were 61,872 women in state and
federal prisons--6.1 percent of all prisoners. The male
incarceration rate, 719 per 100,000 male residents, was more than
16 times higher than the female incarceration rate--43 per
100,000 female residents. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collects state and
federal prisoner data twice a year--on June 30 and December 31.
These counts are designed to provide regular updates to the
public on the number of people confined by state and federal
authority. The data have been published since 1926. </p>

<p> The report was prepared by Allen J. Beck and Thomas P.
Bonczar, statisticians in the Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS). Data from tables and graphs used in many BJS
reports can be obtained in spreadsheet files on 5 1/4 and 3 1/2

<h2>THE NATION'S CORRECTIONAL POPULATION TOPS 5 MILLION </h2>

<p> <b>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</b> </p>

<p> <b>ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EDT BJS</b> </p>

<p> <b>SUNDAY, AUGUST 27, 1995 202/307-0784</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- More than 5.1 million Americans-or almost
2.7 percent of the adult population--were under some form of
correctional supervision last year, the Department of Justice
reported today. Almost three-quarters of these men and women were
being supervised in the community on probation or parole. The
others were confined in jail or prison. </p>

<p> The number of adults incarcerated or under supervision in the
community increased 3.9 percent during 1994. Since 1980 the
number has almost tripled, growing at an average annual rate of
7.6 percent. </p>

<p> At the end of last year, 2,962,000 adults were on probation
under community supervision rather than incarceration. An
additional 690,000 adults were on parole--conditional supervised
release after serving a prison term but subject to being returned
to incarceration for rule violations or other offenses.
Three-quarters of probationers and parolees were required to
maintain regular contact with a supervising agency. The other
offenders were not required to have regular contact (9 percent)
or had failed to report and could not be located (9 percent). </p>

<p> Texas had the largest number of adults on probation and
parole with more than 503,000 under such supervision, followed by
California with 370,000. At the end of 1994, more than 3.8
percent of all adults in Texas were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> Thirteen states reported that fewer than 1 percent of their
adult populations were on probation or parole. North Dakota had
the lowest probation and parole supervision rate (450 offenders
per 100,000 adults), followed by West Virginia (517), Mississippi
(552) and Kentucky (553). </p>

<p> Overall, the state and federal probation and parole
populations rose by 2.0 percent during 1994. Six states reported
increases of at least 10 percent in their probation populations,
and 11 reported similar increases in their parole populations.
Alabama, with a 14.5 percent rise in their probation population,
and Iowa, with a 27.1 percent rise in the parole population, led
the nation. </p>

<p> Twelve states and the Federal probation system reported a
decrease in the number of adults on probation, led by South
Dakota (down 6.2 percent), California (down 5.8 percent) and the
Federal system (down 6.8 percent). </p>

<p> Half of all offenders on probation in 1994 were on probation
for a felony. A quarter were on probation for a misdemeanor. One
of every seven probationers had been convicted of driving while
intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. Almost all of the
offenders on parole (95 percent) had served a felony sentence in
jail or prison. </p>

<p> Approximately, 21 percent of the nation's probationers were
women, as were 10 percent of the parolees. </p>

<p> About 58 percent of the adults on probation were white, and
45 percent were black. Ninety percent of adults on parole were
men. Fifty-one percent of adults on parole were white, 45 percent
were black. </p>

<p> These data were collected and analyzed by Darrell Gilliard
and Allen Beck, statisticians at the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS). The NCJ number is NCJ-156432. Additional information about

<p> and Sheriffs' Department, 1990: </p>

<p> A LEMAS Report </p>

<p> May 1992 </p>

<p> Few issues are as important in law enforcement today as how
governments at </p>

<p> all levels respond to the challenge to rid our society of
illicit drugs. </p>

<p> This report is drawn from the second triennial survey
conducted by the Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics program.
The survey </p>

<p> included new questions about drugs seized, drug enforcement
techniques, and </p>

<p> testing of arrestees and employees. State and local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies have provided a national understanding of the
innovations in the </p>

<p> fight against drugs-special drug enforcement units,
interagency task </p>

<p> forces, and drug asset forfeiture programs. We salute the
departments in </p>

<p> their cooperation with LEMAS and trust that this profile will
prove </p>

<p> valuable in their assessments and planning. </p>

<p> Steven D. Dillingham, Ph.D. </p>

<p> Director </p>

<p> Drug Enforcement by Police </p>

<p> and Sheriffs' Department, 1990: </p>

<p> A LEMAS Report </p>

<p> By Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D. </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> In 1990, about 9,300 local police departments and 2,500
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments had primary responsibility for the enforcement of
drug laws. </p>

<p> Collectively, these agencies employed 466,000 full-time
officers, 92% of </p>

<p> all local police and sheriffs' officers nationwide. In
addition, 34 State </p>

<p> police departments, employing 43,000 officers, had primary
drug enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities. </p>

<p> This report presents information collected from State and
local law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. It </p>

<p> includes information on types of illegal drugs seized,
operation of special </p>

<p> drug units, multi-agency task force participation, and
receipts from drug </p>

<p> asset forfeiture programs. </p>

<p> For all agencies the report also summarizes how drug testing
policies apply </p>

<p> to arrestees, applicants for sworn positions, and employees. </p>

<p> Major findings include the following: </p>

<p> *Among agencies with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities that served </p>

<p> 50,000 or more residents, over 90% of the police departments
and over 80% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments operated special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> *Nationwide, more than 16,000 local police and sheriffs'
officers, and over </p>

<p> 2,000 State police officers were assigned full time to
special drug units. </p>

<p> *Half of local police and sheriffs' departments with primary
drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities were participating in a
multi-agency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force. These 6,500 agencies had assigned
nearly 10,000 </p>

<p> officers full time to such task forces. </p>

<p> *Among departments with primary drug enforcement
responsibilities, over 90% </p>

<p> of the police departments serving a population of 50,000 or
more, and over </p>

<p> 90% of the sheriffs' departments serving 250,000 or more
residents, </p>

<p> received money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program.
</p>

<p> *Among the State police departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities, 85% operated a special drug unit, 91%
participated in a </p>

<p> multi-agency drug enforcement task force, and 94% received
money or goods </p>

<p> from drug asset forfeitures. </p>

<p> *About 2 in 3 State police departments and 2 in 5 local
police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments reported that at least some of the
persons they </p>

<p> arrested were required to take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *A majority of State police departments and local police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 25,000 or more required that all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions take a test for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> *About 3% of local law enforcement officers worked for
agencies that had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing program for regular field officers;
17% were </p>

<p> employed by agencies that had a random selection testing
program for </p>

<p> officers. </p>

<p> *Nonprobationary officers could be dismissed after one
positive test in </p>

<p> about two-thirds of local police and sheriffs' departments
and in about </p>

<p> three-fourths of State police departments. Nearly all
departments had a </p>

<p> policy specifying dismissal for two positive drug tests. </p>

<p> *Treatment alternatives were a part of the drug testing
policy for </p>

<p> employees in about half of State and local police departments
and two- </p>

<p> fifths of sheriffs' departments. Such alternatives were
generally limited </p>

<p> to the first positive test results only. </p>

<p> THE LEMAS SURVEY </p>

<p> The 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) </p>

<p> survey questionnaire was mailed to all 780 State and local
law enforcement </p>

<p> agencies with 100 or more sworn officers and to a sample of
2,338 agencies </p>

<p> with fewer than 100 officers. Of the 3,118 agencies receiving
the LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, 2,945 (94.5%) responded. The survey used a
sampling frame </p>

<p> based on personnel data from the 1986 Directory Survey of Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Agencies. (See Methodology for further discussion of
sampling.) </p>

<p> The local police departments included in this report are
general purpose </p>

<p> agencies operated by municipal or county governments. The
State police </p>

<p> departments included in this report are the primary general
purpose </p>

<p> agencies in all States except Hawaii, which does not have a
State police </p>

<p> department. </p>

<p> This report presents only data collected on drug-related
policies. The BJS </p>

<p> Bulletins State and Local Police Departments, 1990
(NCJ-133284) and </p>

<p> Sheriffs' Departments, 1990 (NCJ-133283) present other data
collected in </p>

<p> the LEMAS survey. </p>

<p> The first section of this report, on drug enforcement
activities, includes </p>

<p> only agencies with primary drug enforcement responsibilities.
Agencies </p>

<p> involved in drug enforcement only in a backup capacity, or
those whose </p>

<p> responsibilities are limited to traffic enforcement, jail
operation, court </p>

<p> operations or other such duties are not included. The second
section, on </p>

<p> drug testing policies, includes all local police, sheriffs',
and State </p>

<p> police departments. </p>

<p> Drug enforcement activities </p>

<p> State and local law enforcement agencies made an estimated
1.1 million </p>

<p> arrests for drug law violations during 1990, according to the
Uniform Crime </p>

<p> Reports (UCR) of the FBI. Excluding traffic violations, 1 in
every 13 </p>

<p> arrests made during the year was for a drug-related offense. </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> During 1990, 77% of the Nation's local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> reported they had primary responsibility for the enforcement
of drug laws </p>

<p> in areas under their jurisdiction. These 11,800 agencies
employed 466,000 </p>

<p> full-time officers, 92% of all local officers nationwide. </p>

<p> Over 9,000 local police departments, employing 96% of all
local police </p>

<p> officers, reported they had primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. </p>

<p> Nearly all of the police departments in jurisdictions of
10,000 or more in </p>

<p> population had such responsibilities. These 2,800 departments
employed </p>

<p> approximately 300,000 full-time officers. Departments in
towns with a </p>

<p> population of 2,500 to 9,999 (83%), or a population less than
2,500 (60%), </p>

<p> were less likely to have primary drug enforcement
responsibilities. These </p>

<p> 6,500 departments in smaller communities employed about
46,000 officers. </p>

<p> About 2,500 (81%) of the sheriffs' departments nationwide
reported having </p>

<p> primary drug enforcement responsibilities in 1990. Sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with a population of under 100,000
were somewhat </p>

<p> more likely to have drug enforcement responsibilities than
those in larger </p>

<p> jurisdictions (83% versus 65%); however, the departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 100,000 or more employed more officers than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions (77,000 versus 42,000). </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments with primary drug
enforcement </p>

<p> responsibilities seized numerous types of illegal drugs
during the 12-month </p>

<p> period ending on June 30, 1990. Across all categories,
departments in </p>

<p> larger jurisdictions were more likely to have seized each
type of drug than </p>

<p> those in smaller jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Most of the police and sheriffs' departments serving a
population of 50,000 </p>

<p> or more seized nearly all of the types of drugs asked about
in the survey. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions, marijuana and cocaine were the
only drugs </p>

<p> seized by more than a third of all departments, and only
marijuana was </p>

<p> seized by more than half. </p>

<p> Eighty-six percent of local police depart-ments and 94% of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments made seizures of marijuana--higher percentages
than for any </p>

<p> other drug. The percentage of departments making marijuana
seizures was </p>

<p> 94% or higher for departments in all population categories,
except for </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments serving a population of 10,000 or less
(88%) and </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 2,500 or less
(70%). </p>

<p> According to UCR data for 1990, 30% of all arrests for drug
law violations </p>

<p> were marijuana-related. About 4 in 5 marijuana arrests were
for </p>

<p> possession, and the remainder, for offenses related to
trafficking. </p>

<p> Cocaine was seized by 72% of local police and sheriffs'
departments, the </p>

<p> second highest total percentage for any drug type. All police
departments </p>

<p> serving a population of 100,000 or more, and over 90% of
those serving </p>

<p> 10,000 to 99,999 residents, reported making seizures of
cocaine. Over 95% </p>

<p> of the sheriffs' departments serving 50,000 or more residents
reported </p>

<p> making seizures of cocaine. Only among police departments
serving under </p>

<p> 2,500 residents (39%), and sheriffs' departments serving
under 10,000 </p>

<p> residents (50%) did less than 75% of the departments in a
population </p>

<p> category report making cocaine seizures. Among police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments that did seize cocaine, nearly all of them
reported seizing the </p>

<p> powdered form of the drug, and a majority of them also seized
crack </p>

<p> cocaine. </p>

<p> A majority of the police departments serving a population of
25,000 or more </p>

<p> made heroin seizures, including all of those serving 500,000
or more </p>

<p> residents. More than two-thirds of the sheriffs' departments
in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 or more also
reported seizing </p>

<p> heroin. </p>

<p> Amphetamine seizures were made by 40% of all police and
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments, including more than 70% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more. More than half of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 50,000 or more also reported making seizures of barbiturates,
methampheta- </p>

<p> mines, and LSD. PCP was seized by most of the police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 250,000 or more and the sheriffs' departments
serving 500,000 </p>

<p> or more. An aspect of the drug enforcement effort in many
jurisdictions </p>

<p> involves the operation of special drug enforcement units.
Where they </p>

<p> exist, such units are an integral part of the law enforcement
response to </p>

<p> drug trafficking and use. Since they focus directly on
conducting </p>

<p> sophisticated investigations of drug traffickers, these
special units </p>

<p> accumulate substantial knowledge about drugs in general and
about drug- </p>

<p> related activity in the community. </p>

<p> Nationwide, an estimated 3,270 local police and sheriffs'
departments were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990 (table 3). Overall, these agencies had over 16,000
officers assigned </p>

<p> to special drug units on a full-time basis. Included in this
total were an </p>

<p> estimated 12,715 police officers and 3,805 sheriffs'
officers. </p>

<p> Over 90% of local police departments serving 50,000 or more
residents were </p>

<p> operating a special drug unit, and 75% of all local police
officers </p>

<p> assigned to a drug unit nationwide were in one of these
departments. </p>

<p> Police departments serving 1 million or more residents had
the largest </p>

<p> special drug units, an average of 240 full-time officers
each. These 13 </p>

<p> departments accounted for a fourth of the local police
officers assigned to </p>

<p> drug units nationwide. </p>

<p> A majority (62%) of the police departments in jurisdictions
with 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents also operated a special drug unit. Local
police </p>

<p> departments in small towns were the least likely to operate a
special drug </p>

<p> unit. About 19% of those serving a population of 2,500 to
9,999 and 5% of </p>

<p> those serving a population of under 2,500 had such a unit. </p>

<p> Among sheriffs' departments, over 90% of those serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more and over 75% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 operated a special drug unit. About 44% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments serving a population of 25,000 to 49,999 operated
a drug unit. </p>

<p> In the smallest jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), 11%
of the </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments had a drug unit. </p>

<p> The average size of special drug units in sheriffs'
departments ranged from </p>

<p> 34 full-time officers in departments serving a population of
1 million or </p>

<p> more to 1 officer in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents. </p>

<p> Many local police and sheriffs' departments operated other
types of special </p>

<p> units that were important to their drug control effort. Over
90% of large </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments (100 or more officers) with
primary drug </p>

<p> enforcement responsibilities operated a special unit for drug
education in </p>

<p> schools during 1990, and nearly 60% were operating a special
unit on gangs. </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies recognize the value of coordinating
their efforts </p>

<p> to reduce drug abuse. For many police and sheriffs'
departments, this </p>

<p> coordination involves participating in a multiagency drug
enforcement task </p>

<p> force. Organizationally, such task forces often involve the
cooperation of </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies across jurisdictional boundaries and
governmental </p>

<p> levels. </p>

<p> The police and sheriffs' departments in multiagency task
forces develop </p>

<p> coordinated enforcement strategies aimed at accumulating the
evidence </p>

<p> needed to arrest, prosecute, and convict known drug
distributors. </p>

<p> Typically, these strategies involve the use of informants,
surveillance, </p>

<p> and undercover operations. They may also include complex
financial </p>

<p> investigations designed to trace drug distribution networks.
The resources </p>

<p> of special drug units often play an important role in
implementing task </p>

<p> force strategies. Multiagency drug task forces may also
attempt to reduce </p>

<p> problems associated with the illegal drug trade by including
not only law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies but also other types of government
agencies, nonprofit </p>

<p> organizations, business firms, and community groups. By
coordinating </p>

<p> education and health initiatives these task forces attempt to
reduce the </p>

<p> harm that illegal drugs do to the community. </p>

<p> Among agencies with drug enforcement responsibilities, about
half of the </p>

<p> local police departments and two-thirds of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in a task force during the 12-month period
ending on June 30, </p>

<p> 1990. Overall, an estimated 6,500 local police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> participated in multiagency drug enforcement task forces
during this time </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Over 85% of the police and sheriffs' departments in each
population </p>

<p> category of 100,000 or more participated in a task force,
including over </p>

<p> 95% of the departments serving a population of 500,000 or
more. </p>

<p> Approximately 80% of the police and sheriffs' departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 99,999, 65% of those serving a
population of 10,000 </p>

<p> to 24,999, and over 40% of those serving fewer than 10,000
residents </p>

<p> participated in a task force. </p>

<p> During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990,
approximately 6,100 local </p>

<p> police officers were assigned to a multiagency drug task
force full time. </p>

<p> Although police departments serving a million or more
residents had the </p>

<p> most officers assigned to a task force on average (29), over
half of all </p>

<p> local police officers assigned to task forces nationwide were
employed by </p>

<p> departments serving a population of under 25,000. </p>

<p> Sheriffs' departments had about 3,500 officers assigned full
time to drug </p>

<p> task forces, ranging from an average of 10 officers per
department in </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents, to an average
of 1 officer </p>

<p> per department in jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000
residents. </p>

<p> In addition to multiagency task forces, another innovation
for drug </p>

<p> enforcement in many jurisdictions is the use of drug asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> sanctions. Most States have laws that allow the government to
seize </p>

<p> convicted drug traffickers' cash, bank accounts, planes,
boats, cars, </p>

<p> homes, and other items purchased with proceeds from the
illicit drug trade. </p>

<p> State laws vary regarding the disposition of forfeited
assets. Most State </p>

<p> statutes require that outstanding liens be paid first, and
many States </p>

<p> require that all forfeited drug assets go to the State and/or
local </p>

<p> treasury. In some States, law enforcement agencies may keep
property such </p>

<p> as cars, planes, and boats for official use. In other States,
the agencies </p>

<p> can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of what
is forfeited. </p>

<p> About 4,700 local police and sheriffs' departments reported
the receipt of </p>

<p> money or goods from a drug asset forfeiture program during
fiscal 1990. </p>

<p> This represented 41% of all local law enforcement agencies
with primary </p>

<p> drug enforcement responsibilities. A higher percentage of
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments (51%) than police departments (38%) had such
receipts. </p>

<p> The percentage of local police departments with asset
forfeiture receipts </p>

<p> was over 95% in jurisdictions with 50,000 to 999,999
residents. Among </p>

<p> departments serving 1 million or more residents and those
serving 25,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 residents, about 85% received money or goods from an
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. Receiving money or goods from an asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> program was least likely for police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> under 2,500 (11%). </p>

<p> About 95% of sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with
250,000 or more </p>

<p> residents, and about 85% of those serving 50,000 to 249,999
residents had </p>

<p> asset forfeiture pro-gram receipts during fiscal 1990. In the
smallest </p>

<p> jurisdictions (under 10,000 residents), an estimated 27% of
the sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments received money or goods from an asset forfeiture
program. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-four State police departments, employing approximately
43,000 full- </p>

<p> time officers, reported they had primary responsibility for
the enforcement </p>

<p> of drug laws. </p>

<p> Number of Full-time </p>

<p> State police sworn officers </p>

<p> departments employed </p>

<p> Total 49 52,372 </p>

<p> Departments with </p>

<p> primary responsibility </p>

<p> for drug enforcement 34 43,118 </p>

<p> All 34 of these departments reported they made marijuana and
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1990
(table 6). A </p>

<p> large majority of them also seized amphetamines (94%), heroin
(91%), LSD </p>

<p> (88%), methamphetamines (88%), barbiturates (85%), and PCP
(74%). </p>

<p> Like those of local law enforcement agencies, State police
drug enforcement </p>

<p> strategies often involve the operation of special units,
participation in </p>

<p> multiagency drug enforcement task forces, and participation
in a drug asset </p>

<p> forfeiture program. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine (85%) of the State police departments that had
responsibility </p>

<p> for enforcing drug laws were operating special drug
enforcement units. </p>

<p> These 29 departments had assigned a total of 2,138 officers
to these units </p>

<p> on a full-time basis--an average of 74 officers per
department. </p>

<p> Most of these departments (82%) also operated special units
for drug </p>

<p> education in schools, and 29% of them had special units for
gangs. </p>

<p> Thirty-one of the departments (91%) participated in a
multiagency drug </p>

<p> enforcement task force during fiscal 1990. These departments
had 900 </p>

<p> officers assigned to drug task forces, an average of 29 per
department. </p>

<p> All but two of the departments (94%) responsible for drug
enforcement </p>

<p> reported they received money or goods from a drug asset
forfeiture program </p>

<p> during the year. </p>

<p> Drug testing policies </p>

<p> Local police and sheriffs' departments </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of local police and sheriffs' departments reported
that at least </p>

<p> some of their arrestees were tested for illegal drugs. Drug
testing of </p>

<p> arrestees was most likely to exist in police departments
serving a </p>

<p> population of 500,000 or more (56%) and in sheriffs'
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (60%). </p>

<p> Among local police departments that reported testing of
arrestees, about 1 </p>

<p> in 8 were responsible for operation of the testing program.
In sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments with arrestee testing, about 1 in 4 operated the
testing </p>

<p> program. </p>

<p> About a fourth of both local police and sheriffs' departments
required all </p>

<p> applicants for sworn positions to submit to a drug test. The
prevalence of </p>

<p> drug testing of applicants increased with the size of the
population </p>

<p> served. Among local police departments, 80% of those serving
a population </p>

<p> of 250,000 or more required all applicants for sworn
positions to be tested </p>

<p> for illegal drugs. About 70% of those serving a population of
50,000 to </p>

<p> 249,999 and just under 50% of those serving a population of
10,000 to </p>

<p> 49,999 had such a requirement. The percentage of police
departments with a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing policy for applicants was smallest
among those </p>

<p> serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents (25%) and those serving
fewer than 2,500 </p>

<p> residents (14%). </p>

<p> Slightly more than 40% of sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 100,000 or more had a policy requiring drug testing of all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions. About 30% of departments serving from 25,000
to 100,000 </p>

<p> residents had such a policy. Sheriffs' departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> less than 25,000 (15%) were the least likely to require all
applicants for </p>

<p> sworn positions to undergo tests for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> Small percentages of all local police and sheriffs'
departments had a </p>

<p> mandatory drug testing requirement for probationary officers,
regular field </p>

<p> officers, candidates for promotion, officers in drug-related
positions, or </p>

<p> civilian personnel. In every population category, less than
25% of the </p>

<p> police and sheriffs' departments had mandatory drug testing
for the above </p>

<p> personnel types, except the following: Probationary officers
and officers </p>

<p> in drug-related positions in police departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 or more. </p>

<p> Small percentages of local police and sheriff's departments
were also using </p>

<p> random selection to test applicants or employees for illegal
drugs. An </p>

<p> estimated 2% of all departments tested applicants through
this method, and </p>

<p> the percentage of departments with random drug testing was no
more than 5% </p>

<p> for any personnel position. Random selection testing was most
common for </p>

<p> officers in drug-related positions employed by police
departments serving a </p>

<p> population of 1 million or more (36%). </p>

<p> About 10% of all local police and sheriffs' departments
required regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of using illegal drugs to take a
drug test. The </p>

<p> percentage of departments with suspicion-based testing was
similar for </p>

<p> other types of employees. About 2% of the departments had
such a policy </p>

<p> for applicants. </p>

<p> Departments in larger jurisdictions were more likely than
those in smaller </p>

<p> jurisdictions to have a suspicion-based drug testing program.
For example, </p>

<p> among local police departments, about two-thirds of local
police </p>

<p> departments serving 250,000 or more residents authorized
testing of regular </p>

<p> field officers suspected of drug use, compared to about half
of those </p>

<p> serving a population of 50,000 to 249,999, about a third of
those serving a </p>

<p> population of 25,000 to 49,999, and a ninth of those serving
population of </p>

<p> 2,500 to 9,999. In police departments serving a population of
under 2,500, </p>

<p> roughly 1 in 30 authorized testing of regular field officers
suspected of </p>

<p> illegal drug use. </p>

<p> About 40% of the sheriffs' departments serving a population
of 1 million or </p>

<p> more had a policy authorizing testing of regular field
officers suspected </p>

<p> of illegal drug use. About 30% of the departments serving a
population of </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999, and 20% of those serving a population of
100,000 to </p>

<p> 499,999 had such a policy. Less than 10% of the sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> located in jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents
had a policy </p>

<p> that authorized drug testing of officers suspected of drug
use. </p>

<p> Nationwide, the local police departments that had a
suspicion-based drug </p>

<p> testing program for regular field officers employed 50% of
all local police </p>

<p> officers. The sheriffs' departments with such a testing
program employed </p>

<p> 31% of all sheriff's officers. An estimated 17% of all local
police </p>

<p> officers and 12% of sheriffs' officers worked for departments
that had a </p>

<p> random selection program for regular field officers. About 3%
of local </p>

<p> police officers and 4% of sheriffs' officers were employed by
departments </p>

<p> that had a mandatory drug testing requirement for field
officers. </p>

<p> Local police departments that tested civilian employees
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use employed 45% of all such employees nationwide. About 30%
of civilian </p>

<p> employees in sheriffs' departments worked in department with
a suspicion- </p>

<p> based testing program for civilians. </p>

<p> Civilian employees in sheriffs' departments were more likely
to be a part </p>

<p> of a random selection drug testing program than their
counterparts in local </p>

<p> police departments (9% versus 3%). About 5% of the civilian
employees in </p>

<p> local police and sheriffs' departments were subject to a
mandatory drug </p>

<p> testing requirement. </p>

<p> For comparison, the results of a 1988 survey conducted by the
Department of </p>

<p> Labor showed that 3% of private nonagricultural businesses
had a drug </p>

<p> testing program of some type, including 43% of those with
1,000 or more </p>

<p> employees. Overall, about 20% of private sector employees
worked for a </p>

<p> company with a drug testing program. (Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Survey </p>

<p> of Employer Anti-drug Programs, Report 760, January 1990.) </p>

<p> Among local law enforcement agencies with an employee drug
testing program, </p>

<p> an estimated 61% of the police departments and 69% of the
sheriffs' </p>

<p> departments specified dismissal as a possible disciplinary
sanction against </p>

<p> nonprobationary officers after one positive drug test. </p>

<p> Local police officers testing positive for the first time
were most likely </p>

<p> to face dismissal as a possible sanction in larger
jurisdictions. All </p>

<p> police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
had a policy </p>

<p> specifying dismissal as a possible sanction after one
positive drug test, </p>

<p> and 83% of those serving a population of 250,000 to 999,999
had such a </p>

<p> policy. </p>

<p> Suspension was the most serious disciplinary sanction
specified for an </p>

<p> initial positive drug test in 14% of the police and sheriffs'
departments </p>

<p> that tested employees for illegal drugs. </p>

<p> After a second positive drug test by a nonprobationary
officer, the </p>

<p> percentage of local law enforcement agencies specifying
dismissal as the </p>

<p> most serious disciplinary sanction increased to 93% for
police departments </p>

<p> and to 98% for sheriffs' departments. </p>

<p> Treatment was specified as a possible alternative for
nonprobationary </p>

<p> officers with positive drug test results in almost half of
the local police </p>

<p> and sheriffs' departments with a testing program. The drug
testing </p>

<p> policies of local police departments specified treatment
alternatives more </p>

<p> often than those of sheriffs' departments (49% versus 39%).
Treatment </p>

<p> alternatives were generally limited to the first offense. </p>

<p> Among police departments, treatment alternatives were most
likely to exist </p>

<p> in jurisdictions with a population of 50,000 to 249,999,
where two-thirds </p>

<p> of them had such a policy. Among sheriffs' departments, those
serving </p>

<p> 500,000 to 999,999 residents (62%) were the most likely to
have treatment </p>

<p> alternatives specified in their drug testing policy. </p>

<p> Police departments serving a population of 1 million or more
(20%) were the </p>

<p> least likely of all local law enforcement agencies to specify
treatment as </p>

<p> a possible alternative for officers who test positive for
drugs. </p>

<p> State police departments </p>

<p> Thirty-three (67%) of the 49 primary State police departments
reported that </p>

<p> at least some of the persons they arrested were being tested
for illegal </p>

<p> drugs. Four (8%) of the departments reported that they had
primary </p>

<p> responsibility for operation of the testing program. </p>

<p> Percent of departments </p>

<p> in which at least some </p>

<p> arrestees are tested </p>

<p> Total 67% </p>

<p> Agency-operated </p>

<p> program 8 </p>

<p> Not agency-operated 59 </p>

<p> Just over half (55%) of State police departments reported
they required </p>

<p> drug tests of all applicants for sworn positions. Two (4%) of
the </p>

<p> departments reported they required all regular field officers
to undergo </p>

<p> tests for illegal drugs, and five (10%) tested all officers
working in </p>

<p> drug-related positions. None of the State police departments
reported </p>

<p> having a mandatory drug testing policy for civilian
personnel. </p>

<p> Some State police departments used a random selection process
to test </p>

<p> probationary officers (12%), regular field officers (8%),
candidates for </p>

<p> promotion (8%), and officers working in drug-related
positions (10%). One </p>

<p> department (2%) had a random selection drug testing program
for applicants, </p>

<p> and two departments (4%) required civilian personnel to be
included in a </p>

<p> random selection drug testing program. </p>

<p> Although no State police departments had a mandatory drug
testing </p>

<p> requirement for civilian employees, nearly half (45%) of all
civilian State </p>

<p> police employees worked in departments that tested civilian
employees </p>

<p> suspected of using illegal drugs. A similar proportion of
sworn State </p>

<p> police employees (53%) were subject to suspicion-based drug
testing. About </p>

<p> 7% of State police officers were employed by departments with
random </p>

<p> selection testing for regular field officers and an equal
percentage worked </p>

<p> in departments with a mandatory drug testing requirement for
such officers. </p>

<p> About three-fourths (77%) of the State police departments
with a drug </p>

<p> testing program specified dismissal as a possible sanction
against </p>

<p> probationary officers after one positive drug test. After a
second </p>

<p> offense, dismissal was a possible sanction specified by 91%
of the </p>

<p> departments. </p>

<p> Half of the departments with employee drug testing specified
treatment as a </p>

<p> possible alternative after the first offense. As in local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies, treatment alternatives were generally not available
to State </p>

<p> police officers who tested positive for drugs a second time. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) survey </p>

<p> collects data from a nationally representative sample of the
nearly 17,000 </p>

<p> publicly funded State and local law enforcement agencies in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> All 780 State and local law enforcement agencies in the
United States with </p>

<p> 100 or more sworn officers (as reported in the 1986 Directory
Survey of Law </p>

<p> Enforcement Agencies) received the full-length LEMAS
questionnaire. The </p>

<p> 780 self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented by a
nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of all agencies with fewer than 100
sworn officers. </p>

<p> These nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were chosen using a
stratified </p>

<p> random sample with cells based on the type of agency (local
police, </p>

<p> sheriff, or special police), size of population served, and
number of sworn </p>

<p> officers. The 2,338 NSR agencies received a slightly
abbreviated LEMAS </p>

<p> questionnaire, which did not contain items about job
classifications, </p>

<p> residency requirements, special pay, collective bargaining,
police </p>

<p> membership organizations, special units, or written policy
directives. </p>

<p> The initial mailing of the survey questionnaire was conducted
in July 1990. </p>

<p> The pay period containing June 15, 1990, was used as the
reference date for </p>

<p> personnel-related questions and June 30, 1990, for other
questions. The </p>

<p> data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics. </p>

<p> After two followup mailings and additional telephone calls as
needed, a </p>

<p> final total of 2,945 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire, </p>

<p> including 738 SR agencies and 2,207 NSR agencies. The overall
response </p>

<p> rate was 94.5%. The final data-base includes responses from
1,830 local </p>

<p> police departments, 840 sheriffs' departments, 226 special
police </p>

<p> departments, and the 49 primary State police departments. </p>

<p> The base weight for all SR agencies is 1. For NSR local and
special police </p>

<p> departments, the base weight is 8.128, and for NSR sheriffs'
departments it </p>

<p> is 4.09857. The final weight associated with every agency,
both SR and </p>

<p> NSR, is the product of the base weight and a factor that
adjusted for any </p>

<p> nonresponding agencies in each sample cell. This agency
nonresponse factor </p>

<p> was based on number of sworn officers for SR agencies and on
number of </p>

<p> agencies for NSR agencies. </p>

<p> Some responding agencies did not completely answer the LEMAS
questionnaire. </p>

<p> When an agency did not supply a response to an item, a donor
agency was </p>

<p> randomly selected from responding agencies in the same sample
cell. The </p>

<p> donor agency's value for the item was placed into the
nonresponding </p>

<p> agency's response field with an indicator that the value had
been imputed. </p>

<p> Complete documentation regarding sampling procedures and
non-response </p>

<p> adjustments is available upon request. </p>

<p> Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100 sworn
personnel were </p>

<p> collected from a sample, the results are subject to sampling
error. All </p>

<p> statements of comparison in this report have been tested to
ensure that </p>

<p> observed differences between values are significant at 2
standard errors </p>

<p> (the 95-percent confidence level) or higher. </p>

<h2>Systemwide Strategies To Alleviate Jail Crowding </h2>

<p> <img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Andy Hall</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>National Institute of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>January 1987</b> </p>

<p> The words &quot;jail&quot; and &quot;crowding&quot; seem
inseparable these days. A 1983 National Institute of Justice
survey of more than 1,400 criminal justice officials from all
parts of the country identified jail and prison crowding as the
most serious problem facing criminal justice systems.(1) </p>

<p> The reality of more prisoners than available beds creates a
dilemma for local justice officials. Crowded jails may compromise
public safety through a lack of space to confine those who pose
serious threats to the community. Lawsuits challenging crowded
conditions may constrain a community's ability to incarcerate, </p>

<p> A recent Bureau of Justice Statistics <i>Bulletin </i>notes
that 22 percent (134) of the Nation's 621 largest jails (those
with a capacity of more than 100) were under court order in 1984
to expand capacity or reduce the number of inmates housed, and 24
percent (150)<i> </i>were under court order to improve one or
more conditions of confinement. (2) </p>

<p> Building or expanding facilities is often necessary to house
those who must be incarcerated. The time and costs of
construction and operation of new institutions, however, argue
that other options should not be overlooked. (3) </p>

<p> For the local sheriff or jail administrator, jail crowding
creates increased prisoner and staff tensions, increased wear and
tear of facility and equipment, budgetary problems from overtime
staffing, and an inability to meet program and service standards.
Less frequently recognized are the problems crowding creates for
other justice system officials: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Judges, prosecutors, probation and parole, and other
        officials often find crowding a severe constraint in
        cases where jailing offenders appears necessary but space
        is unavailable. </li>
    <li>Prosecutors, public defenders, and pretrial services
        officers find their functions impaired by delayed access
        to inmates caused by difficulty in processing large
        numbers of offenders. </li>
    <li>Court functions overall may suffer when crowding affects
        the movement of inmates to and from scheduled
        appearances. </li>
</ul>

<p> Too often, however, agencies outside jail management are not
fully involved in efforts to cope with the problem. </p>

<p> Many jurisdictions address the symptoms of jail crowding but
leave the underlying causes unaddressed. Other jurisdictions,
however, view jail crowding as a problem that demands the
cooperative involvement of all key figures in the local justice
system. </p>

<p> Given the success of this <i>systemwide </i>approach in a
number of locations, the National Institute of Justice sponsored
development of <i>Alleviating Jail Crowding: A Systems
Perspective </i>(NCJ 99462, 1985), based on a survey of justice
system officials and programs throughout the United States. The
report stresses that while construction of new facilities may be
part of a community's solution to crowding, emphasis must also be
placed on ensuring that existing bed space is used effectively.
Accordingly, the report highlights the role of each local
criminal justice agency in ensuring the effective use of jail bed
space to prevent crime and maintain public safety. This <i>Research
in Brief </i>summarizes the full report. </p>

<p> <b>Looking at the local justice system</b> </p>

<p> Virtually every decisionmaker in the local justice system
exercises discretion that can affect the jail population.
Jurisdictions using a systemwide approach to jail crowding see
the local justice system as a screening mechanism that can be
modified to enhance the use of scarce jail space. </p>

<p> These jurisdictions develop case-processing flowcharts to
understand the details of their case-handling process from the
initial contact to final disposition. Flowchart, illustrate the
stages of the legal process, specify the points at which
decisionmaker actions affect the jail population, and identify
opportunities to alleviate crowding. </p>

<p> Understanding the local flow of cases can help policymakers
identify program and process changes to reduce crowding. Program
changes frequently involve eliminating the jailing of persons
whom a community deems inappropriate for criminal justice
processing, such as the mentally ill. </p>

<p> Process changes improve system efficiency, eliminating
case-handling &quot;catch points&quot; that unnecessarily prolong
the confinement of persons who might eventually be released
through bail, probation, or transfer to the State prison. </p>

<p> Reducing length of confinement often becomes the first focus
of population reduction, because efficiency measures are
generally less costly and more readily implemented than new
programs. Local analysis often reveals that the primary
underlying cause of crowding is excessive length of confinement
due to inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> <b>How system decisionmakers can affect jail crowding</b> </p>

<p> System studies in a number of jurisdictions have suggested,
as one judge said, &quot;a lot of little ways&quot; to halt or
reverse jail population increases without releasing serious
offenders. The following discussion highlights just a few of the
&quot;little ways&quot; available at different parts of the
system. </p>

<p> Law enforcement - Decision, surrounding local arrest
practices whether to arrest, transport to jail or </p>

<p> stationhouse, book or detain for bail setting - are critical
determinants of jail population size. Law enforcement practices
both before and after arrest can be modified to reduce jail
admissions. Jurisdictions such as San Diego County, California,
and Frederick County (Winchester), Virginia, use perhaps the most
common form of prearrest diversion through short-term
&quot;sobering up&quot; facilities for public inebriates. </p>

<p> San Diego has been successful in reducing crowding through
the use of a privately operated detoxification reception program
where inebriates must remain for a minimum 4-hour period. Though
in a largely rural area, the Winchester, Virginia, detoxification
program, operated by the Division of Court Services, has also
diverted a large number of persons from jail. </p>

<p> Similar prearrest diversion programs are in effect for
persons involved in family disputes(4) and for homeless persons
in a number of jurisdictions throughout the United States. </p>

<p> Law enforcement officials in Galveston County, Texas, have
instituted practices to divert the mentally ill-a population that
frequently makes up 10 to 20 percent of a jail's population. A
team of deputies receives special training to assist in meeting
the emergency needs of the mentally ill, thereby allowing the
agency to take them directly to a mental health facility. </p>

<p> Many agencies also use a number of postarrest practices such
as station-house release before booking, field citations, and
court-delegated authority to release suspects according to a bail
schedule to eliminate unnecessary confinement. </p>

<p> Jail administrators - Elected sheriffs or appointed jail
executives are often viewed as the managers most affected but
least powerful in dealing with jail crowding. While having little
direct control over admissions and length of confinement, jail
administrators nevertheless can help reduce crowding by assuring
ready access for pretrial release screening and bail review. </p>

<p> Quick access to detainees tends to be a common characteristic
of successful programs to reduce jail crowding. For example, the
sheriff in Mecklenburg County (Charlotte), North Carolina, allows
pretrial services staff to be present during the jail admissions
process, which gives them access to defendants and speeds
decisionmaking. </p>

<p> Individual judges often lack feedback regarding prisoners in
jail awaiting or following adjudication. Yet such information is
of interest to the court and critical to jail population
reduction. The Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, administrator
provides data to help judges monitor the court status of
prisoners and prevent length of confinement from being extended
through oversight or inattention. </p>

<p> In some other jurisdictions, jail administrators are
delegated authority to release defendants pretrial or divert
drunk drivers to treatment centers. Other administrators help
develop nonjail pretrial-release and sentencing options or
cooperate with other jurisdictions to alleviate crowding on a
multicounty basis. </p>

<p> <b>Prosecutors </b>- Prosecutors act at more case-handling
decision points than any other officials. This gives them an
especially important role in containing jail population growth. </p>

<p> Early case screening by prosecutors reduces unnecessary
length of confinement by eliminating or downgrading weak cases as
soon as possible. Assistant prosecutors in Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin, review arrests around the clock by examining police
records and conducting meetings between complainants and
suspects. This practice enables Milwaukee prosecutors to decide
on the appropriate charge within 24 to 36 hours after arrest. </p>

<p> Prosecutors in Milwaukee also use &quot;vertical case
processing&quot; - assigning the same attorney or team of
attorneys to prosecute a case from start to finish. Though not
necessarily the case in all jurisdictions, reassigning cases from
one assistant prosecutor to another while the matter is before
the court &quot;horizontal case processing&quot; - may cause
stagnation in caseflow, increased requests for continuances, and
lengthened time to trial. </p>

<p> Prosecutor cooperation is essential for alternatives in
arrest, pretrial confinement, and sentencing. Prosecutor
participation and leadership are essential to the effectiveness
of task forces dealing with jail crowding. Since the prosecutor
&quot;owns&quot; cases on behalf of the State, others are rarely
willing to propose case-handling changes without the prosecutor's
support. </p>

<p> Recognizing that a lack of space to confine dangerous persons
is a threat to public safety, prosecutors in a number of
jurisdictions have taken an active role in reducing jail crowding
by serving on &quot;key court officials&quot; groups or chairing
jail population reduction boards. </p>

<p> <b>Pretrial services </b>- Providing background information
on defendants, release recommendations, and other pretrial
assistance can be an important component of solutions to
crowding. Pretrial services can often help merely by adjusting
staff schedules to ensure timely screening and interviews for a
maximum number of defendants. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, for example, pretrial
services and magistrate bail setting are available 24 hours, 7
days a week. In Kentucky, pretrial staff are on call 24 hours a
day to interview persons at rested, notify judges by phone of the
prisoner's qualifications for release, and supervise the release
process if nonfinancial bail is authorized. </p>

<p> Limited release authority is delegated to pretrial services
staff in an increasing number of jurisdictions. In San Mateo
County (Redwood City), California, pretrial staff are authorized
to release misdemeanor suspects prior to their first court
appearance. Seattle, Washington, is experimenting with delegated
release on certain felony charges. </p>

<p> Many pretrial programs respond to jail population pressures
by expanding the range of release options (conditional and
supervised release, third-party custody, unsecured bail, deposit
bail) and by conducting regular bail reviews for those detained
for trial. </p>

<p> A National Institute of Justice study found that supervised
release programs in Miami, Florida; Portland, Oregon; and
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, significantly reduced the bail-held
population without significantly increasing the risk to public
safety. </p>

<p> <b>Judiciary</b> - Judges make more decisions affecting jail
population than anyone else; this often makes them leaders in
seeking jail-crowding solutions. Judges can issue summonses
instead of arrest warrants; provide guidelines authorizing direct
release by police, jail, and pretrial staff; and provide bail
setting outside normal court hours. Evaluators of the 4-year Jail
Overcrowding Reduction Project of the former Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration found that the project's most
successful sites were those with strong judicial leadership. </p>

<p> Many courts provide 24-hour bail-setting magistrates. The
King County (Seattle), Washington, District Court has a
&quot;three-tier&quot; release policy that reduces court time,
jail admissions, and length of confinement. The court established
guidelines specify the charges for which pretrial services staff
may (1) release without consulting the court, (2) release after
phoning a duty judge, or (3) make recommendations to the court in
the most serious felony cases. </p>

<p> Reducing court delay is crucial to effective use of jail
space. Bexar County, Texas, seeks to eliminate &quot;dead
time&quot; by having the court administrator work with a jail
case coordinator to identify cases in need of special attention
and processing steps that can be shortened. Each judge receives
weekly a list of prisoners awaiting indictment, trial,
sentencing, or revocation in his or her court. </p>

<p> One result is a 50-percent time saving in disposing of
misdemeanor charges and thus a significant cut in overall length
of confinement. </p>

<p> Many judges have worked to extend the range of nonjail
sentencing options, using probation supervision, </p>

<p> suspended sentences, fines, community service and
restitution, halfway house placements, and specialized treatment
facilities as true alternatives to incarceration. </p>

<p> A growing number of courts now defer service of jail
sentences, when the jail is at capacity, in cases in which jail
is believed an appropriate sentence but immediate jailing is not
essential for the community's safety. </p>

<p> <b>Defense - </b>The National Institute's field test on Early
Representation by Defense Counsel found that early screening for
indigency, defender appointment, and defendant contact can
decrease length of confinement and thus yield substantial savings
of jail space.(6) Vertical case processing in defense offices
also helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Mecklenburg County, pretrial conferences between defense
and prosecution help identify, eliminate, or downgrade marginal
cases and facilitate plea negotiation. Both offices can thus
budget staff time efficiently and lessen pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> In St. Louis, Missouri, efforts to reduce staggering defender
caseloads by appointing private attorneys in felony cases have
also reduced case disposition time, stimulated bail review, and
resulted in shorter pretrial confinement. </p>

<p> <b>Probation and parole - </b>Not only do probation and
parole agencies provide nonjail alternatives for sentencing, they
can enhance case- processing efficiency by streamlining
presentence investigation (PSI) procedures and expediting
revocation decisions. All this helps cut length of confinement. </p>

<p> In Brevard County, Florida, the jail population oversight
committee spotlighted PSI delays and worked with probation and
parole officers to cut PSI preparation time from 90 days to 30 or
35 days for jail cases. The county also cut to 24 hours the time
required for decisions on probation revocation, thus decreasing
the use of jail beds for persons on probation &quot;hold&quot;
orders. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the local level </b>- State legislation, court
rules, executive orders, and other &quot;external factors&quot;
can affect jail populations - Guidelines on diversion, bail
policy, appointment of legal counsel, sentencing practices, and
jail operation all can affect the range of solutions available. </p>

<p> Other outside factors that need to be considered in local
planning for jail use include local -demographics, availability
of State and Federal resources, public opinion and media coverage
of criminal justice issues, activities of local civic<b> </b>groups
and community organizations, and political campaigns and
referendums. </p>

<p> <b>Outside the system</b>-Organizations outside the justice
system can be instrumental in alleviating shortages </p>

<p> of jail space by providing emergency shelter, detoxification,
and treatment facilities for the mentally disturbed, public
inebriates, and drunk drivers. Many jurisdictions use local
mental health centers to provide prompt mental health
assessments, diversion, and outpatient treatment. Private
agencies in several jurisdictions provide temporary shelter for
juveniles, pretrial supervision, and community service
placements. </p>

<p> <b>Formulating solutions</b> </p>

<p> While individual parts of the system can help through such
practices as those highlighted above, one or two agencies in the
local justice system are not enough to bring about comprehensive
solutions to crowding. Jail crowding results from the actions of
many, with their decisions interacting to determine jail
admissions and length of confinement. Effectively combating
crowding requires taking into account the interactive nature of
the problem. </p>

<p> Jurisdictions that successfully implemented a systemwide
approach to jail crowding have identified as critical needs (1)
the participation of key decisionmakers in formulating solutions
and (2) detailed information on case processing and on the actual
characteristics of the jail population. </p>

<p> <b>Key decisionmaker participation - </b>Whether it is a
&quot;jail population management board&quot; or some other body,
experience in many jurisdictions argues for a forum that
encourages communication and participation by judges,
prosecutors, sheriffs, police, probation officials, and other
policymakers in developing solutions to crowding. </p>

<p> Collective involvement provides increased awareness of the
impact of one agency's actions on another and of the other
agency's procedures. Also, recommendations of a broadly
constituted planning group are more likely to gain systemwide
support. Finally, the political pragmatism that may accompany
committee action may permit some participants to support more
imaginative policies. </p>

<p> <b>Information - </b>A<b> </b>systemwide approach to jail
crowding requires improved information about jail use. In
addition to the detailed flowcharts that help assess the
timeliness of case-processing decisions and the availability of
nonjail options, planners need information on precisely who or
what type of person is in jail and why and how long they stay.
This permits administrators to learn the frequency of admissions
and the size and variation of distinct segments of the jail
population, as well as indicating sluggish case processing. </p>

<p> Statistical analysis of the population identifies symptoms of
jail crowding, greatly enhancing the ability to identify and
treat the causes. But while jail population data are valuable,
they should not overshadow case-processing information. </p>

<p> Analysis of data on the jail population might show, for
example, that persons detained before trial are released only
after 7 to 10<b> </b>days. Alone, this finding could indicate the
need for a special pretrial services program to expedite
screening and bail review. Information on caseflow, however,
might reveal the actual cause to be inefficient case processing. </p>

<p> Evaluation information is also critical to developing
effective strategies. Evaluation data should be collected and
analyzed to determine if planned modifications in decisionmaking
are being made and the resulting positive or negative
implications for crowding and public safety. </p>

<p> <b>Implementing strategies and conclusions</b> </p>

<p> Localities that take a systemwide approach to jail crowding
generally follow some important steps: </p>

<p> <b>Involve </b>all key system decisionmakers; </p>

<p> <b>Collect</b> all necessary data on jail population and case
processing; </p>

<p> <b>Identify</b>, implement, and evaluate appropriate changes
in programs or processes; and </p>

<p> <b>Inform</b> the public of system changes when initiated and
successful strategies when confirmed. </p>

<p> While many communities have taken great steps, experience has
also confirmed the complexity of the jail crowding problem and
the futility of seeking a panacea through one or two changes.
Long-term success requires a variety of solutions and, most
important, the time, patience, and attention of the entire
criminal justice community. </p>

<h3><img src="../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="BOTTOM">From the
Director </h3>

<p> Communities throughout the Nation face the problem of jail
crowding: Having more prisoners than space to house them. Despite
construction innovations that may help cities or counties expand
their confinement capacity both more quickly and at less expense,
a host of problems, including fiscal pressures sometimes, may
indicate solutions other than construction. </p>

<p> Some consequences of jail crowding are well known: Increased
victimization and fear, decreased public confidence that
dangerous persons can be locked up, lawsuits, court-imposed
limits on the number of prisoners, damage to facilities and
equipment. Crowding increases both tension in the institution and
the strain on correctional budgets. </p>

<p> Less obvious but equally worrisome are delays in case
processing due to cumbersome access to prisoners and the limits
put on such necessary judicial options as pretrial release and
sentencing. </p>

<p> National Institute of Justice surveys have shown that
officials in law enforcement, courts, corrections, and other
parts of the justice system were virtually unanimous in naming
prison and jail crowding their number one concern. </p>

<p> Recognition of the gravity of jail crowding, however, offers
a glimmer of hope. Officials in a growing number of jurisdictions
have concluded that if each part of the local justice system does
what it can to ease crowding, the sum of all<b> </b>these small
solutions has a notable cumulative effect. </p>

<p> The separate decisions of law enforcement, judicial
prosecution, defense, pretrial services, probation, corrections,
and other officials can interact to influence the number of jail
admissions and length of confinement. Jurisdictions taking this
systemwide approach find that seemingly minor modifications in
case processing can both reduce crowding and, more important,
improve the overall administration of justice. </p>

<p> Jail crowding is a local problem that must be dealt with
locally. The National Institute of Justice hopes to contribute to
such endeavors, however, by assessing and synthesizing
information on the program and process changes that local
jurisdictions may want to consider. Without information on the
experience of other jurisdictions, informed policy decisions are
hard to come by. </p>

<p> At<b> </b>the Institute, our role is one articulated by
President Reagan and Attorney General Meese: To support, not to
direct, local responsibilities. Experience demonstrates that we
have many useful tools to deal with jail crowding. <i>This
Research in Brief </i>offers local jurisdictions their choice
among such options. </p>

<p> ADVANCE FOR RELEASE AT 5 P.M. EST </p>

<p> BJS SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1993 202-307-0784 </p>

<p> <b>20 YEARS OF MEASURING CRIME SHOWS FEWER OFFENSES OVERALL
BUT INCREASED VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES AND THE YOUNG </b> </p>

<p> WASHINGTON, D.C. -- After 20 years of asking Americans what
their actual experiences with crime have been, the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) today identified
several long-term trends: </p>

<p> --Overall, the number of criminal victimizations dropped 6
percent since the annual National Crime Victimization Survey
began in 1973. </p>

<p> --The steepest declines are in household burglary and theft.
--Blacks are substantially more likely to be violent crime
victims than are whites. </p>

<p> --Young minority males in central cities are violent crime
victims at the highest rates the survey ever recorded. The data
are from the survey's 20th anniversary report, which noted that
more than 4.4 million interviews were conducted from 1973 through
last year. &quot;While the overall trends are positive, some
groups of Americans are disproportionately the victims of
increasing crime,&quot; observed Lawrence A. Greenfeld, the
acting BJS director. &quot;For example, last year blacks
experienced the highest per capita rates of violent crime in the
survey's history.&quot; &quot;The survey also documented the
growing ratio of violent crime,&quot; Greenfeld pointed out.
&quot;In 1973 about 15 percent of all crimes were violent
compared to 20 percent in 1992. Moreover, about a third of all
victims of violence report an injury.&quot; During the last two
decades an estimated 37 million victims were injured, and more
than one-third of those injured had no health insurance or were
not eligible for public health benefits. Among other report
highlights: </p>

<p> --Handguns are used in about 10 percent of all violent
crimes. Handgun crime rates are above the 1986 low but have not
returned to the highest rate reached in 1982. </p>

<p> --During 1991 an estimated $19.1 billion were lost directly
from personal and household crimes. </p>

<p> --Males are much more likely to be victims of violence
inflicted by strangers than by family members or other close
associates, whereas females are as likely to be hurt by family
members and close associates as by strangers. </p>

<p> --About 30 percent of all violent crimes and 25 percent of
home burglaries occur when the victim or victims are away from
home on a leisure activity. </p>

<p> --In approximately half of all female rapes the victim knew
the offender. Strangers used some type of weapon in 29 percent of
the offenses, compared to 17 percent by non-stranger rapists. </p>

<p> --In robberies during which the offender threatened the
victim before the attack, those victims who defended themselves
in some way were less likely to lose property but were more
likely to be injured than were victims who took no action. When
the offender had a handgun, the victim was seriously injured in 1
percent of the incidents in which self- protective measures were
not taken, compared to 7 percent when such action was taken. </p>

<p> --Households earning more than $30,000 annually are generally
more likely than are households in most other income categories
to experience theft of a motor vehicle, but as household income
rises, burglary rates fall. </p>

<p> --Black male teenagers (that is boys and young men from 12
through 19 years old) are more likely to be violent crime victims
than any other group of people. Their average annual rate is 113
victimizations per 1,000 residents--or almost one in nine black
teenagers. For white male teenagers the rate was 90 per 1,000--or
about one in 11. </p>

<p> --For adult black males (35 through 64 years) the violent
victimization rate was 35 per 1,000. For adult white males, 18
per 1,000; adult white females, 15; adult black females 13;
elderly (65 years or more) black males 12; elderly black females,
10; elderly white males, 6 and elderly white females, 3 per
1,000. The rate of criminal victimizations for all U.S. residents
compared to other life experiences is as follows: </p>

<p> Occurrences Yearly rate per 1,000 adults </p>

<p> Accidental injury, all circumstances 220 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at home 66 </p>

<p> Personal theft 61 </p>

<p> Accidental injury at work 47 </p>

<p> Violent victimization 31 </p>

<p> Assault (aggravated and simple) 25 </p>

<p> Motor vehicle accident injury 22 </p>

<p> Death, all causes 11 </p>

<p> Victimization with injury 11 </p>

<p> Aggravated assault 8 </p>

<p> Robbery 6 </p>

<p> Death from heart disease 5 </p>

<p> Death from cancer 3 </p>

<p> Rape (women only) 1 </p>

<p> Accidental death, all circumstances 0.4 </p>

<p> Death from pneumonia or influenza 0.4 </p>

<p> Death in motor vehicle accident 0.2 </p>

<p> Suicide 0.2 </p>

<p> Death from HIV infection 0.1 </p>

<p> Homicide and capital punishment executions 0.1 </p>

<p> The survey measures rape, robbery, assault, burglary,
personal and household larceny and motor vehicle theft. It does
not measure murder, kidnapping or commercial crimes. </p>

<p> Last year 39 percent of all these crimes were reported to
police--the highest since 1973, when it was 32 percent. The
increased reporting rate was consistent with the fact that
violent crime and motor vehicle theft have made up an increasing
proportion of total crime during the last two decades. The
highest reporting rate last year was for completed motor vehicle
theft--92 percent. The lowest was for personal larceny without
contact--15 percent. </p>

<p> DRUG DATA PRODUCED BY BJS </p>

<p> Many Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) programs produce data
on drug law enforcement, drug offenders, and drugs and crime. For
example -- * the BJS National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
asks victims of personal crimes if they believed the offenders
had been using drugs * the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program produces information on
drug-related programs of State and local police agencies </p>

<p> * the BJS National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) examines
drug law violators' criminal histories and status at time of
arrest, pretrial release/detention status, trial appearance, and
disposition </p>

<p> * the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) compares
sentences given to drug offenders with those given to other
offenders </p>

<p> * BJS reports on Federal and State prisoners, jail inmates,
and incarcerated youth including data on their histories of drug
use and drug offenses </p>

<ul>
    <li>the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program collects and
        publishes detailed data on drug law violators in the
        Federal justice system </li>

</ul>

<p> Drugs and crime facts, 1994 presents the most current
information available relating to drugs and crime published by
BJS in over two dozen different reports through the end of

pretrial release, type of release, and pretrial misconduct of
Federal defendants, including Federal drug offenders. </p>

<p> * Women in prison (BJS Special Report, March 1994) reports on
female inmates in State prisons in 1991 including prior drug and
alcohol use, needle sharing behaviors, treatment, and prior

November 1994) reports on criminal history, pretrial processing,
pretrial misconduct, adjudication, and sentencing of felony
defendants, including drug offenders, in State courts in large
urban counties. </p>

<p> * Federal law enforcement officers, 1993 (BJS Bulletin,
December 1994) reports on the number of Federal law enforcement
officers authorized to carry firearms and arrest offenders,
including Federal drug law violators. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Felony sentences in State courts, 1992 (BJS Bulletin,
        December 1994) reports on the number of felony drug
        convictions, sentence type and length, and case
        processing time for drug offenders. </li>

<p> DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS AT THE TIME OF OFFENSE </p>

<p> The BJS National Crime Victimization Survey asks victims of
the violent crimes of rape, robbery, and assault about their
perceptions of the offender's use of alcohol and drugs. In 30% of
violent crime victimizations in 1992, victims reported that they
believed their assailants were under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. In half of violent crime victimizations, the victim did
not know whether the offender was under the influence. </p>

<p> Data from BJS corrections surveys show that a quarter of
convicted jail inmates, a third of State prisoners, and
two-fifths of youths in long-term, State-operated facilities
admit that they were under the influence of an illegal drug at
the time of their offense. </p>

<p> Among jail inmates in 1989-- </p>

<p> * 44% used drugs in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 30% used drugs daily in the month before the offense </p>

<p> * 27% used drugs at the time of the offense. </p>

<p> Jail inmates convicted of drug offenses most frequently
reported having been under the influence of drugs at the time of
their offense (39%), followed by convicted burglars (38%) and
robbers (36%). Jail inmates convicted of driving while
intoxicated (DWI) (12%), assault (14%), and homicide (18%) were
the least likely to report having been under the influence of
drugs at the time of the offense. </p>

<p> In 1991, 49% of all State prison inmates reported that they
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol or both at the time
they committed the offense for which they were currently
sentenced: 17% were under the influence of drugs only, and 14%
were under the influence of drugs and alcohol. </p>

<p> Half of the State prisoners said they had taken illegal drugs
during the month before committing the crime. </p>

<p> Among violent offenders in State prisons-- </p>

<p> * 61% said that they or their victims were under the
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 50% reported being under the influence of alcohol or drugs
at the time of the offense </p>

<p> * 30% said their victims were under the influence of alcohol
or drugs. </p>

<p> Nearly 40% of the youth incarcerated in long-term,
State-operated facilities in 1987 said they were under the
influence of drugs at the time of their offense. </p>

<p> Data from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Drug Use
Forecasting (DUF) program revealed that of a sample of adult
males arrested in 23 U.S. cities in 1993, the percent testing
positive for any drug ranged from 54% in Omaha and San Jose to
81% in Chicago. Among the 20 cities reporting data on female
arrestees, the percent of females testing positive for any drug
ranged from 42% in San Antonio to 83% in Manhattan. </p>

<p> PRIOR DRUG USE BY OFFENDERS </p>

<p> Data from BJS surveys show that 78% of jail inmates in 1989,
79% of State prisoners in 1991, 60% of Federal prisoners in 1991,
and 83% of youth in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987
had used drugs at some point in their lives. </p>

<p> Although drug use by State prison inmates in the month before
the offense fell between 1986 and 1991, a higher proportion of
inmates reported use of cocaine or crack in 1991 than 1986. One
in three inmates who ever used drugs in the past used a needle to
inject drugs. Fifteen percent of inmates who had ever used drugs
had shared a needle at least once. </p>

<p> * any drug was 16 </p>

<p> * a major drug (including heroin, crack, cocaine, PCP, LSD,
and methadone) was 18 </p>

<p> * a major drug regularly was 20. </p>

<p> Sixty percent of jail inmates who ever used any drug reported
they had done so more than a year before their first arrest. Of
inmates who reported using a major drug regularly, 55% had not
done so until after their first arrest. </p>

<p> Almost 83% of youth in long-term, State-operated juvenile
facilities in 1987 reported use of an illegal drug in the past,
and 63% had used an illegal drug on a regular basis. The most
commonly mentioned drugs were marijuana, cocaine, and
amphetamines. </p>

<p> Among drug-using youth in long-term, State- operated juvenile
facilities, 19% said they first used drugs before age 10; 38%
reported their first use was before age 12. </p>

<p> DRUG-RELATED CRIME </p>

<p> Overall, 10% of Federal prison inmates in 1991, 17% of State
prison inmates in 1991, and 13% of convicted jail inmates in 1989
said they committed their offense to obtain money for drugs.
Twenty percent of Hispanic State prison inmates said they
committed their offense to get money for drugs, compared to 15%
of white inmates and 17% of black inmates. Twenty-four percent of
female inmates said they committed their offense to get money to
buy drugs, compared to 16% of male inmates. </p>

<p> Inmates incarcerated for robbery, burglary, larceny, and drug
trafficking most often committed their crime to obtain money for
drugs. </p>

<p> Inmates who committed homicide, sexual assault, assault, and
public-order offenses were least likely to commit their offense
to obtain money for drugs. </p>

23,271 homicides in which circumstances were known were
narcotics- related. This includes only those murders that
occurred specifically during a narcotics felony, such as drug
trafficking or manufacturing. Those homicides that involved a
narcotics felony and a more serious felony, such as armed
robbery, were not tabulated as drug-related. </p>

<p> A study of murder cases disposed in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties in 1988 found that circumstances involving
illegal drugs, such as a drug scam or dispute over drugs,
accounted for 18% of the defendants and 16% of the victims. In 7%
of cases, victims and their killers were both at the murder scene
because of drugs. Of victims, 12% were involved with the killer
in a drug relationship. </p>

<p> DRUG LAW ENFORCEMENT </p>

<p> Federal, State, and local agencies share responsibility for
enforcing the Nation's drug laws, although most arrests are made
by State and local authorities. State and local police made an
estimated 1.1 million arrests for drug law violations in 1993,
according to the FBI. </p>

<p> As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics-- </p>

<p> * the Federal Government seized 6,605 clandestine drug
laboratories between fiscal years 1975 and 1993 </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993, of the 286 labs seized, 237 (83%)
manufactured methamphetamines </p>

<p> * in 1993 the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) program
for eradicating domestic marijuana resulted in the destruction
of393 million plants in 64,132 plots, 12,397 arrests, 6,062
weapons seized, and assets seized valued at $52 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 DEA confiscated 133,665 pounds of
cocaine, 1,590 pounds of heroin, 39 pounds of opium, 314,054
pounds of marijuana, 2.8 million dosage units of hallucinogens,
and 80.5 million dosage units of stimulants </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the DEA completed 16,690 asset seizures
valued at $680 million </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Customs Service seized 507,249
pounds of marijuana, 175,318 pounds of cocaine, and 17.9 million
dosage units of drugs such as LSD and barbiturates </p>

<p> * in 1993 the U.S. Coast Guard confiscated 48,441 pounds of
marijuana and 32,313 pounds of cocaine </p>

<p> * in fiscal year 1993 the U.S. Postal Service made 2,193
arrests for mailing controlled </p>

<p> substances </p>

<p> * in 1992 State and Federal courts authorized wiretaps in 634
narcotics cases. </p>

<p> Drug seizure data from different Federal agencies should not
be added together because in many instances more than one agency
participated in the operations. The Federal-wide Drug Seizure
System (FDSS) reflects the combined drug seizure efforts of the
DEA, FBI, and the U.S. Customs Service within the jurisdiction of
the United States, as well as maritime seizures by the U.S. Coast
Guard. FDSS eliminates duplicate reporting of a seizure involving
more than one Federal agency. </p>

were seized in fiscal 1993 by the Federal agencies participating
in FDSS: </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS </p>

<p> As reported in Federal law enforcement officers, 1993, as of
December 1993, Federal agencies employed about 69,000 full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms. The DEA
employed 2,813 full-time agents. These officers investigate major
narcotics violators, enforce regulations governing the
manufacture and dispensing of controlled substances, and perform
a variety of other functions in support of drug trafficking
prevention and control. </p>

<p> The FBI employed 10,075 full-time agents. These agents
investigate more than 250 types of Federal crimes. The FBI has
concurrent jurisdiction with the DEA over drug offenses under the
Controlled Substances Act. </p>

<p> According to the BJS Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program, in 1990, about 9,300
local police departments, 2,500 sheriffs' departments, and 34
State police departments, employing over 500,000 full-time
officers, had primary responsibility for drug law enforcement. </p>

<p> Drug-related law enforcement activities include making
arrests and seizing drugs as well as laboratory testing of drugs,
drug education, and drug testing of arrestees and agency
employees. Most agencies serving 50,000 or more residents
operated a special drug enforcement unit, participated in a
multiagency task force, and received money or goods from an asset
forfeiture program: </p>

<p> * Special drug units focus on conducting investigations on
drug traffickers and drug-related activities in the community. </p>

<p> * To coordinate efforts with other law enforcement agencies
to accumulate evidence, most large agencies participate in a
multiagency task force. These task forces develop enforcement
strategies such as the use of informants, surveillance, and
undercover operations. </p>

<p> * Most States have laws that allow the government to seize
convicted drug traffickers' assets, such as cash, bank accounts,
planes, boats, cars, and homes. Many State laws require that all
forfeited assets go to the State and/or local treasury upon
payment of outstanding loans. In some States, law enforcement
agencies can keep all property, cash, and proceeds from sales of
what is forfeited. </p>

<p> PRETRIAL RELEASE OF DRUG DEFENDANTS </p>

<p> The National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) revealed that
of persons charged with a felony drug offense in 1992 in the 75
most populous counties-- </p>

<p> * 68% were released prior to case disposition </p>

<p> * 27% were held with bail set </p>

<p> * 5% were held without bail. </p>

<p> The median amount of bail set for a person charged with a
drug offense was $5,000. Defendants charged with a drug offense
were more likely to secure release (29%) when bail was set at
$20,000 or more than those charged with a violent offense (17%),
public-order offense (18%), or a property offense (11%). </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released prior to the disposition
of their case, 51% were released within 1 day of their arrest,
79% within 1 week, and 93% within 1 month. </p>

<p> Of felony drug defendants released before case disposition,
27% failed to make a scheduled court appearance within 1 year.
Seventy percent of the defendants who failed to appear returned
to court by the end of the 1-year study period, while 30%
remained fugitives. </p>

<p> Sixteen percent of released drug defendants were known to
have been rearrested while on pretrial release. </p>

<p> Of all released defendants rearrested for a drug offense, 59%
were once again granted pretrial release. </p>

<p> PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING OF FEDERAL DRUG LAW VIOLATORS </p>

<p> The number of suspects prosecuted for drug offenses increased
from 7,697 in 1981 to 25,663 in 1991. U.S. attorneys declined to
prosecute 22.3% (7,814) of suspected drug offenders who were
investigated in matters closed in 1991, a lower percentage than
for offenders suspected of violent offenses (29.5%), property
offenses (48.5%), and public-order offenses (36%). </p>

<p> The number of persons convicted of violating Federal drug
laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981. This 190%
increase exceeded the 53% growth in U.S. district court
convictions for all Federal offenses during the same years and
accounted for over 67% of the total increase in Federal
convictions. </p>

<p> The number of defendants convicted of drug possession
offenses increased from 498 in 1981 to 1,163 in 1991 -- a 134%
increase. Drug possession convictions were 7% of all drug
convictions in 1991. </p>

<p> Drug offenses accounted for 19% of all defendants convicted
in 1981 and 35% of all defendants convicted in 1991. Drug
trafficking offenses alone accounted for 33% of all defendants
convicted in 1991. The conviction rate for drug defendants
increased from 76% in 1981 to 84% in 1991. </p>

<p> The percentage of offenders convicted of drug offenses
sentenced to prison rose from 73% in 1981 to 87% in 1991. </p>

<p> The average prison sentence for persons charged with Federal
drug violations was longer than for all other offenses except
violent crimes in 1991. </p>

<p> Average sentence length for persons sentenced to Federal
prisons for drug and nondrug offenses, 1991 </p>

<p> All offenses 62 mos. </p>

<p> Violent offenses 91 </p>

<p> Property offenses 21 </p>

<p> Federal drug offenses 86 </p>

<p> Trafficking 87 </p>

<p> Possession 22 </p>

<p> Public-order offenses 38 </p>

<p> Drug offenders are receiving longer sentences and are serving
a larger percentage of their sentence than in the past. The
average Federal prison sentence for drug offenses rose from 62
months in 1986 to 86 months in 1991. The average percent of
sentence served until first release increased from 60% in 1985 to
68% in 1990. Contributing to these increases are the sentencing
guidelines that went into effect in 1987 and the 1986 and 1988
anti-drug abuse laws which prescribed stiffer sentences and
mandatory minimum incarceration terms for Federal offenders. </p>

<p> The BJS 1990 Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities reported on drug treatment and intervention programs
for 1,024 correctional facilities. Prisons may offer many types
of drug intervention or treatment: detoxification, counseling,
education and or awareness programs, urine surveillance, and
treatment in special residential units within the facility-- </p>

<p> * Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of inmates
for drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, 57%. </p>

<p> * Counseling was available for 14% of inmates in Federal
facilities, 12% in State, and 48% in community-based facilities. </p>

<p> * Residential treatment program capacity was from 1% to 2% of
inmate population for all types of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in
confinement facilities were enrolled and 37% in community-based
facilities were enrolled. The two most common types of programs
for both Federal and State correctional facilities were education
and counseling. </p>

<p> According to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, 43% of all inmates had participated in a
drug treatment program; 36% received their most recent treatment
while incarcerated. Group counseling was the most frequent type
of treatment program. </p>

<p> In 1991, about 57% of Federal drug offenders and 52% of drug
offenders in state prisons were tested for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In Federal prisons, property (1.4%)
and violent (1.1%) offenders had higher positive HIV rates than
drug (0.6%) and public-order offenders (0.6%). In State prisons,
drug (3.2%) and property (2.7%) offenders had higher rates than
public-order (1.9%) and violent (1.4%) offenders. </p>

<p> Drug using offenders have a higher risk for infection with
AIDS-- </p>

<p> * 3.2% of Federal inmates and 4.9% of State inmates who used
a needle to inject drugs, tested positive </p>

<p> * 5.5% of Federal inmates and 7.1% of State inmates who
shared needles to inject drugs, tested positive. About 4% of drug
offenders in Federal prisons and 15% of drug offenders in State
prisons who had shared needles, were HIV positive. </p>

<p> DRUG ENFORCEMENT IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES </p>

<p> Data from the BJS 1990 Census of State and </p>

<p> Federal Correctional Facilities describe the various methods
used to prevent illegal entry of drugs into prisons and to stop
the use of illegal drugs by those under correctional supervision.
These methods include drug testing, questioning, patdowns,
clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> Most prison facilities required new admissions and inmates
returning from temporary release to be patted down and required
them to exchange their clothing for prison-furnished clothing. </p>

<p> Interdiction efforts were more stringent in maximum security
prisons than in medium or minimum security facilities. All
Federal maximum security prisons required clothing exchanges,
compared to 81% of Federal medium security prisons and 78% of
Federal minimum security facilities. Prison visitors are also
subjected to interdiction activities. Most visitors were
questioned verbally and were subjected to searches of their
belongings. Patdowns and body cavity searches were usually
conducted if visitors were suspected of carrying drugs or
paraphernalia. </p>

staff are subjected to interdiction activities, particularly when
under suspicion of drug smuggling. Staff were questioned in 45%
of Federal facilities and 23% of State facilities upon suspicion
of drug involvement. Staff were patted down on suspicion in 19%
of Federal facilities and 14% of State facilities. </p>

<p> The 1990 Census revealed that 7 out of 8 institutions conduct
urine tests on inmates to detect drug use. Of the tests conducted
between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990, evidence of drug use
among State prison inmates was detected in about-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 16 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 28 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 50 tests for methamphetamines </p>

<p> * 1 in 75 tests for heroin. </p>

<p> Among tests conducted among Federal prison inmates, positive
test results were found in approximately-- </p>

<p> * 1 in 100 tests for marijuana </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for cocaine </p>

<p> * 1 in 250 tests for heroin </p>

<p> * 1 in 1,000 tests for methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Most facilities conducted urine tests upon suspicion of drug
use. One in five facilities systematically conducted urine tests

school seniors-- </p>

<p> * 35.3% reported having ever used marijuana/hashish </p>

<p> * 6.1% reported having ever used cocaine </p>

<p> Self-reports of drug use among high school seniors may
underrepresent drug use among youth of that age because high
school dropouts and truants are not included, and these groups
may have more involvement with drugs than those who stay in
school. </p>

<p> The 1993 high school seniors were asked, &quot;How much do
you think people risk harming themselves?&quot; </p>

<p> Those students answering &quot;great risk&quot; in regular
use accounted for the following percentages-- </p>

<p> * marijuana, 72.5%, up from a low of 34.9% in 1978, but down
from 76.5% in 1992 </p>

<p> * cocaine, 90%, up from a low of 68.2% in 1977 and 1978 </p>

<p> * heroin, 88.3%, virtually stable since 1975 </p>

<p> * LSD, 79.4%, following a low of 79.1% in 1977 and a high of
84.5% in 1990. </p>

<p> Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey </p>

<p> School Crime Supplement show that in the first half of 1989,
2 out of 3 students ages 12 to 19 reported availability of drugs
at their school. </p>

<p> Availability of drugs was reported more often by-- </p>

<p> * public school students (70%) than by private school
students (52%) </p>

<p> * students in grades 9 to 12, compared to students in grades
6 to 8. </p>

<p> Similar rates of drug availability were reported by-- </p>

<p> * white students (69%) and black students (67%) </p>

<p> * students residing in cities (66%), suburban areas (67%),
and nonmetropolitan areas (71%). </p>

<p> The survey also showed that most drugs, while available, were
difficult to obtain. </p>

<p> As reported in the 1991 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, a 1990 national survey of fifth and sixth graders
found that-- </p>

<p> * 15% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use
marijuana; 5% knew kids their own age who tried or who use
marijuana </p>

<p> * 10% knew adults or older kids who tried or who use cocaine;
2% knew kids their own age who use cocaine or crack </p>

<p> * 90% agreed with the statement &quot;drugs bought on the
street are not safe to use&quot; </p>

<p> * 7% said they will probably have tried drugs by the time
they enter high school. </p>

<p> About 6% of State prison inmates belonged to a gang prior to
incarceration, according to data from the 1991 Survey of Inmates
in State Correctional Facilities. </p>

<p> Among inmates who were gang members </p>

<p> . 81% reported past drug use </p>

<p> . 69% said they manufactured, imported, or sold drugs as a
group </p>

<p> . 92% reported their gang fought other groups. </p>

<p> Of inmates who reported belonging to a gang before entering
prison, 32% were still members at the time of incarceration. On
average, they had joined a gang at age 14. Half reported that
their gang had 60 or more members. </p>

<p> In 1991, among Federal offenders who had trafficked in,
grown, or manufactured illegal drugs or who had managed drug
money, 25% said they were a member of a group or organization
that engaged in illegal drug activities. About 11% were leaders
or middle men in a drug organization. About 9% belonged to
organizations with 11 or more members. </p>

<p> Fifteen percent of students ages 12 to 19 reported the
presence of street gangs at their school, according to 1989 data
from the National Crime Victimization Survey School Crime
Supplement. </p>

<p> Seventy-eight percent of students who reported gang presence
at their school said drugs were available compared to 66% of
students who reported gangs were not present. </p>

<p> Students at schools with gangs were more likely to fear an
attack both at school and on the way to school and were more
likely to avoid certain areas inside the school. </p>

<p> DRUG USE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION </p>

<p> According to data from the 1993 Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Administration (SAMHSA) National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse-- </p>

<p> * 77 million Americans age 12 or older (37% of the
population) reported use of an illicit drug at least once in
their lifetime </p>

<p> * 12% reported use of a drug within the past year </p>

<p> * 6% reported use of a drug within the past month. </p>

<p> Preliminary data from the 1993 survey show that marijuana and
cocaine use is most prevalent among those ages 18 to 34. </p>

number of drug-related emergency room episodes and drug-related
deaths. </p>

<p> The SAMHSA Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) reported an
estimated 433,493 drug-related episodes in hospital emergency
rooms nationwide in 1992, an 10% increase from 393,968 in 1991. A
total of 7,532 deaths related to drug abuse were reported in 1992
by medical examiners in 38 metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT DRUGS </p>

<p> As reported in the 1993 BJS Sourcebook of criminal justice
statistics, the percentage of Gallup Poll respondents describing
drug abuse as the single most important problem facing our
country peaked in 1989: </p>

<p> Drug abuse most serious </p>

<p> Date of poll problem </p>

<p> January 1985 2% </p>

<p> July 1986 8 </p>

<p> April 1987 11 </p>

<p> September 1988 11 </p>

<p> May 1989 27 </p>

<p> November 1989 38 </p>

<p> April 1990 30 </p>

<p> July 1990 18 </p>

<p> March 1991 11 </p>

<p> March 1992 8 </p>

<p> January 1993 6 </p>

<p> January 1994 9 </p>

<p> Among Gallup Poll respondents, the use of drugs was most
often mentioned as one of the biggest problems for schools in
their communities. Giving that response in 1993 were-- </p>

<p> * 14% of public school parents </p>

<p> * 9% of nonpublic school parents </p>

<p> * 17% of those with no children in school </p>

<p> * 16% of all surveyed. </p>

<p> When asked about spending for various social problems, 60% of
the respondents to a 1993 National Opinion Research Center (NORC)
Poll said this country is spending too little to deal with drug
addiction. </p>

<p> In 1990 Gallup Poll respondents were asked how best the
government should allocate its resources in its fight against
drugs: </p>

<p> * 40% said &quot;teaching young people about the dangers of
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 28% said &quot;working with foreign governments to stop the
export of drugs to this country&quot; </p>

<p> * 19% said &quot;arresting people in this country who sell
drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 5% said &quot;helping drug users to overcome their
addiction to drugs&quot; </p>

<p> * 4% said &quot;arresting the people who use drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> Gallup Poll respondents were asked, &quot;What is the most
important thing that can be done to help reduce crime?&quot; In
1989, the most frequent response was to cut the drug supply
(25%), followed by harsher punishment (24%). In 1981, 3% of
respondents mentioned cutting the drug supply, while harsher
punishment was mentioned by 38% of respondents. </p>

<p> NORC has asked adults (age 18 or older) about legalization of
marijuana since 1973. In 1993, 22% believed that marijuana should
be made legal, down from a peak of 30% in 1978. </p>

<p> College freshmen have been surveyed by NORC since 1968. In
1993, 28.2% of those surveyed agreed strongly or somewhat that
marijuana should be legalized, down from a high of 52.9% in 1977
and up from a low of 16.7% in 1989. Of 1993 high school seniors--
</p>

<p> * 22.8% felt using marijuana should be legal, down from 32.9%
feeling that way in 1978 and up from a low of 14.9% in 1986 </p>

<p> * 75.5% reported worrying often or sometimes about drug
abuse, up from 65.5% in 1978 and down from 82.6% in 1990. </p>

<p> In 1990 a Gallup Poll asked what respondents felt would be
the effect of legalizing drugs: </p>

<p> Effect of legalization would increase: </p>

<p> Drug use in public schools 65% </p>

<p> The number of addicts 67 </p>

<p> The number of drug overdoses 63 </p>

<p> Drug-related crime 52 </p>

</p>

<p> This Bulletin presents counts of the Nation's prisoners at
the end of 1990. The 1990 increase of nearly 59,000 prisoners
equals a demand for approximately 1,100 new prison beds per week
nationwide. Prisons were estimated to be operating from 18% to
29% above their capacities at yearend. </p>

<p> Strong evidence exists that during the 1980's there was an
increasing probability that a convicted offender would go to
prison. The ratio of prison admissions to reported serious crimes
and arrests for serious crimes increased to levels unequalled in
almost 30 years of reporting. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Justice Statistics expresses its appreciation
to the departments of corrections in the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Federal Prison System, that make it possible
for us to gather and report data on the Nation's prisoners. </p>

<p> PRISONERS IN 1990 </p>

<p> By Robyn L. Cohen </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1990 reached a record
high of 771,243. The States and the District of Columbia added
52,331 prisoners; the Federal system, 6,355. The increase for
1990 brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
441,422 - an increase of about 134% in the 10-year period. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (8.2%) was less than the percentage
increase recorded during 1989 (13.5%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1990 was 26,271 less than the number added
during the preceding year (84,957). The 1990 increase translates
into a nationwide need for approximately 1,100 prison bedspaces
per week, compared to 1,600 prison bedspaces per week needed in
1989. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1990, growing by 8.6% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (like those, for example, awaiting trial in
States with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during the
year (10.7% versus 8.5%). For States, the rate of increase in the
number of sentenced prisoners was lower than in 1989 (13%). </p>

<p> Among the 13,318 Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of a year or less were 1,910 under the jurisdiction of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a decrease of 45 from
the number held at the end of 1989 (1,955). The number of Federal
prisoners with no sentences or sentences of less than a year
increased by 1,315 during 1990 (from 12,003 to 13,318), while the
number of sentenced prisoners increased by 5,040. </p>

<p> Total prison populations in Alaska, the District of Columbia,
Oregon, Rhode Island, and Tennessee altogether decreased by 1,675
inmates during 1990. The District of Columbia accounted for more
than half of this decline. The percentage of growth was the
highest during 1990 in Vermont (15.9%), Washington (15.4%), and
New Hampshire (15.1%). Thirteen States reported total prisoner
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1989. California's
increase of more than 10,000 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction. At the end of 1990, about 1 in 8 prisoners
nationwide were confined in a California institution. California
accounted for more than 17% of the increase nationwide during the
year. </p>

<p> Rates of Incarceration Increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1990, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 293, also setting a new record. Ten of the
16 jurisdictions with rates equal to or greater than the rate for
the Nation were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 1 was
in the Midwest, and 1 was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 111%, from 139 to 293. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 167% (from 87 to 232) and the West,
up by nearly 163% (from 105 to 276). The per capita number of
sentenced prisoners in the Midwest climbed 119% (from 109 to
239), and the rate rose 68% in the South (from 188 to 315). The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents
has increased 133% (from 9 to 21) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison Populations in Western States Grow the Fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1990 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Western States, with a
gain of 9.2%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 8.8% in
the Northeast, 8.8% in the South, and 6.9% in the Midwestern
States. The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 10.7%. </p>

<p> In 13 States the percentage change in the number of sentenced
prisoners during 1990 was equal to or higher than that of 1989.
Among these jurisdictions, four had increases of at least 10%,
led by New Hampshire (15.1%), Texas (13.7%), Alabama (13.2%), and
Georgia (10.1%). </p>

<p> From the end of 1985 to December 31, 1990, net gains in the
number of sentenced prisoners have averaged about 1,000 prisoners
per week - a weekly gain of about 922 State prisoners and 75
Federal prisoners per week over the period. The largest net gains
have occurred in the South (306 inmates per week) followed by the
West (243), the Midwest (194), and the Northeast (179). During
1990 average growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal
prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,131 additional bed- spaces
per week, about 354 fewer than the average weekly growth in 1989.
</p>

<p> The sentenced prisoner population had increased in four
States by 90% or more since 1985: California (94%), Colorado
(107%), Michigan (93%), and New Hampshire (97%). California's
increase of 45,796 sentenced prisoners since 1985 accounts for
72% of the increase for the West and 19% of the increase among
all States over the period. In 1985, 10.8% of the Nation's
sentenced State prisoners were in California; in 1990, 13.7%. </p>

<p> Male Prisoner Population Growth Outpaces that of Females </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (727,398) increased at a faster
rate during 1990 (8.3%) than the number of female inmates (7.9%).
This is the first year since 1981 that the number of male inmates
has increased at a faster rate than the number of female inmates.
The rate of incarceration for sentenced males (566 per 100,000
males in the resident population) was about 18 times higher than
for sentenced females (31 per 100,000 females in the resident
population). At the end of 1990, women accounted for 5.7% of
prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> The 1990 growth rate (7.9%) for female inmates was less than
the percentage increase recorded during 1989 (24.4%). As shown
below, the percentage change was lower in 1990 across all the
regions and at the Federal level. </p>

<p> Percent Increase in Female Inmate Population </p>

<p> 1989-90 1988-89 </p>

<p> Total 7.9% 24.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.0 36.8 </p>

<p> State 7.2 23.1 Northeast 9.2 29.8 </p>

<p> Midwest 7.1 19.5 </p>

<p> South 7.2 23.6 </p>

<p> West 6.3 22.3 </p>

<p> In 1990, 22 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 10 had increases of at least 10%, led by New
Jersey's increase of 17.5% (from 886 in 1989 to 1,041 in 1990).
California's increase during 1990, 502 inmates, accounted for
15.7% of the nationwide increase of 3,199. </p>

<p> Local Jails Held More than 18,000 Because of State Prison
Crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1990, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,380 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities. The number of State
prisoners held locally decreased by 3.6% over that of yearend
1989. Three States - Louisiana, New Jersey, and Virginia -
accounted for more than half of the prisoners sentenced to prison
but incarcerated locally. Five States - Arkansas, Louisiana, New
Jersey, Tennessee, and Virginia - held more than 10% of their
State- sentenced prisoners in local jails because of State
facility crowding. Overall, 2.4% of the State prison population
was confined in local jails on December 31, 1990, because of
prison crowding. </p>

<p> Prison Capacity Estimates are Difficult to Compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
reflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend 1990 - rated, operational, and design
capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> - Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by
a rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> - Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> - Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 32 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 38 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-six
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most Jurisdictions are Operating Above Capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with emergencies. At the end of 1990, nine States
reported they were operating below 95% of their highest capacity.
</p>

<p> Forty-two jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity; 34
of these held populations that met or exceeded their highest
reported capacities. </p>

<p> Overall, at the end of 1990 State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 115% of their highest capacities and 127% of
their lowest capacities. Prisons in Southern States were found to
be operating closest to their reported capacity on each measure. </p>

<p> The Federal system was estimated to be operating at 51% over
capacity. Between 1989 and 1990, State and Federal prison
capacities were estimated to have increased by approximately
20,000-50,000 beds. At the end of 1990, prisons nationwide were
estimated to be from 18% to 29% over their capacities. </p>

<p> Prison Population Growth may Reflect Increasing Certainty of
Punishment </p>

<p> There is some evidence that during the period 1980-89 changes
in criminal justice policies have increased a criminal's
probability of being incarcerated from levels existing in prior
years. </p>

<p> Murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, and burglary are among the most serious crimes and
account for approximately half of prison commitments from courts.
In 1960 there were 62 prison commitments for every 1,000 of these
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies. During the rest of
the decade this ratio steadily declined reaching 23 in 1970 and
was relatively stable during the 1970's. Between 1980 and 1989
the ratio increased from 25 commitments per 1,000 reported crimes
to 62. </p>

<p> Similarly, between 1960 and 1970 the ratio of prison
commitments to adult arrests for the selected crimes declined
from 299 per 1,000 to 170. This ratio was relatively stable
during the 1970's, but it increased between 1980 and 1989, from
196 commitments per 1,000 adult arrests to 332. (See
Methodological note for more detail on these data.) </p>

<p> Prison-admissions-to-crime ratios for individual States
provide an alternative measure of prison use to population-based
rates. Population-based incarceration rates take into account the
number of sentenced prisoners and the size of the resident
population in a jurisdiction. The crime-based rate measures entry
into prison relative to the number of crimes reported to law
enforcement agencies during a year. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1989 the ratio of court commitments to
prison and reported crimes increased 148%, from 25 commitments
per 1,000 crimes to 62. Over the same period the number of prison
commitments per 100,000 adult residents went up 115%, from 80 to
172. The Northeast had the largest percentage increase in the
number of commitments relative to reported crime and experienced
the largest gain in prison commitments relative to population.
However, in both 1980 and 1989 the South had the largest number
of court commitments to prison relative to reported crime and to
population. </p>

<p> Besides the increased use of prison relative to reported
crime, arrests, and resident population, prison population has
also been affected by changes in the extent of the illegal drug
problem. </p>

<p> An estimated two-thirds of those in State prisons for a drug
offense were convicted of trafficking or manufacturing illegal
drugs. (For additional information on drug offenders in State
prisons, see Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986, BJS Special
Report, NCJ-109926, January 1988 and Drug Use and Crime, BJS
Special Report, NCJ-111940, July 1988.) Since 1985 the number of
adult arrests for drug violations has increased by 74%, and the
number of arrests for sales or manufacturing of illegal drugs has
grown by 137%. </p>

12 female inmates housed in local jails because of crowding.
Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1 year maximum
sentence&quot; include an undetermined number of &quot;Inmates
with a sentence of 1 year or less.&quot; Population totals are
actual counts; however, the male/female breakdown is an estimate
believed to be within 0.1% of the actual counts. By law,
offenders in Massachusetts may be sentenced to terms of up to 2
1/2 years in locally operated jails and correctional
institutions. Such populations are excluded from the State count
but are included in published population counts and rates for
local jails and correctional institutions. </p>

<p> Rhode Island. In this State, prisons and jails form one
integrated system. All NPS data include, therefore, both jail and
prison populations. Tennessee. Population counts for
&quot;Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence&quot; include an
undetermined number of &quot;Inmates with a sentence of 1 year or
less.&quot; Population counts include 1,854 males and 15 females
housed in local jails because of overcrowding of State prison
facilities and exclude 2,593 felons sentenced to serve their time
in local jails. (The State pays to house these 2,593 felons, but
the local court maintains jurisdiction.) Texas. Population counts
are based on custody data. The courts have ordered that the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice Institutional Division (TDCJ-ID)
cannot house more inmates than 95% of capacity. Approximately
2,928 beds are exempt from this rule, and the inmates in these
beds do not count toward the calculation of 95% capacity. The
population counts include all inmates within TDCJ-ID; however,
the capacity figures exclude the 2,928 exempt beds. </p>

<p> Vermont. Population counts are as of December 6, 1990. In
this State, prisons and jails form an almost completely
integrated system. However, some county and municipal authorities
do operate local lockups. NPS data include both jail and prison
populations. The counts for jail crowding include 34 male inmates
housed in local lockups. The capacity figures exclude the 34 male
inmates housed in local lockups. </p>

<p> Washington. Capacity figures exclude space in State
work-release facilities that housed 609 male and 69 female
inmates on December 31, 1990. </p>

<p> West Virginia. The female population counts are based on
custody data. Population counts exclude 87 male and 15 female
inmates housed in local jails because of overcrowding. </p>

<p> Wyoming. The operational capacity figure is the absolute
total bedspace available to Wyoming's Department of Corrections,
and it includes 60 bedspaces in community centers. </p>

<p>Prisoners in 1992 </p>

<p> Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> The number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or
State correctional authorities at yearend 1992 reached a record
high of 883,593. The States and the District of Columbia added
50,809 prisoners; the Federal system, 8,651. The increase for
1992brings total growth in the prison population since 1980 to
553,772, an increase of about 168% in the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The 1992 growth rate (7.2%) was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1991 (6.6%), and the number of new
prisoners added during 1992 was 8,451 more than the number added
during the preceding year (51,009). The 1992 increase translates
into nationwide need for approximately 1,143 prison bedspaces per
week, compared to the nearly 981 prison bedspaces per week needed
in 1991. </p>

<p> Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1992, growing by 7.3% during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsenenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States with
combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased at a
faster rate than sentenced prisoners in the States during 1992
(15.9% versus 6.8%). These annual rates of increase were higher
than in 1991 when the Federal system grew 12.5%, and State
systems, 6.4. </p>

<p> The number of Federal prisoners with no sentences or
sentences of less than a year decreased during 1992 (from 14,912
to 14,553), while the number of sentenced prisoners increased by
9,010. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Oregon, and Wyoming decreased during 1992. The decrease in these
5 States totaled 1,135 inmates. The highest percentages of growth
during 1992 were reported in Texas (18.4%), West Virginia
(16.2%), Nw Hampshire (15.9%), Idaho (15.5%), and Wisconsin
(15.4%). Eight States reported total prisoner population
increases of 10% or more since yearend 1991. </p>

<p> Texas' increase of 9,501 prisoners during the year was the
largest gain in the number of prisoners for any single
jurisdiction, followed by California (7,688), New York (3,874),
and Michigan (2,596). Texas accounted for about 16% of the
increase in prisonpopulation nationwide. </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1992, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 residents was 329, a new record. Twelve of the 19
jurisdictions with rates greater than the rate for the Nation
were located in the South, 4 were in the West, 2 were in the
Midwest, and 1was in the Northeast. </p>

<p> Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen nearly 137%, from 139 to 329. During this
period, per capita incarceration rates have grown most rapidly in
the Northeast, increasing by 198% (from 87 to 259), and the West,
up by184% (from 105 to 298). The per capita number of sentenced
prisoners in the Midwest climbed 149% (from 109 to 271), and the
rate rose 89% in the South (from 188 to 355). The number of
sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents has
increased 18% (from 9 to 26) over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grow the fastest </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1992 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, with a
gain of 7.8% (table 3). The number of sentenced prisoners grew by
6.7% in the Midwest, 5.9% in the West, and 4.6% in the Northest.
The sentenced Federal prison population grew by 15.9%. In 22
States and the District of Columbia the percentage change in the
number of sentenced prisoners during 1992 was higher than that of
1991. Among these jurisdictions, eight had increases of a least
10%, led by Texas (18.4%), Vermont (18.3%), West Virginia
(16.2%), New Hampshire (15.9%), Wisconsin (15.5%), and Idaho
(15.5%). </p>

<p> Since December 31, 1986, net gains in the number of sentenced
prisoners have averaged about 1,039 prisoners per week -- a
weekly gain of about 946 State prisoners and 94 Federal prisoners
per week over the period. The largest net gains have occurred in
te South (344 inmates per week) followed by the West (223), the
Midwest (202), and the Northeast (176). During 1992, the average
growth in the number of sentenced State and Federal prisoners was
equal to a demand for 1,103 additional bedspaces per week, abut
139 more than the average weekly growth in 1991. </p>

<p> In 1992 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
accounted for 52% of the total prison population nationwide --
California, New York, and Texas accounting for over 25%.
Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate with 478 prisoners
per 100,000 esidents. </p>

<p> Male prisoner population grows at a faster pace </p>

<p> The number of male inmates (833,184) increased at a faster
rate during 1992 (7.3%) than the number of female inmates
(50,409, 5.9%). The rate of incarceration for sentenced males
(636 per 100,000 males in the resident population) was over 18
times higher han for sentenced females (35 per 100,000 females in
the resident population). At the end of 1992, women accounted for
5.7% of all prisoners nationwide. </p>

<p> Overall, the 1992 growth rate (5.9%) for female inmates was
less than the 1991 growth rate (8.4%). The growth rate declined
in the Northeast, from 14.6% in 1991 to 1.7% in 1992, and in the
South, from 10.0% to 3.6%. These declines in 1992 offset the
highr growth rates in the Midwest and West. </p>

<p> Percent increase in </p>

<p> female inmate population </p>

<p> 1991-92 1990-91 </p>

<p> U.S. total 5.9% 8.4% </p>

<p> Federal 13.2% 12.8% </p>

<p> State 5.0% 7.8% </p>

<p> Northeast 1.7 14.6 </p>

<p> Midwest 8.2 7.6 </p>

<p> South 3.6 10.0 </p>

<p> West 7.0 .4 </p>

<p> In 1992, 26 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system had more than 500 female inmates. Among these
jurisdictions, 8 had increases of at least 10%, led by Colorado's
increase of 16.3% (from 453 in 1991 to 527 in 1992). The Federal
prison sstem's increase during 1992, 745 inmates, accounted for
26.4% of the nationwide increase of 2,826. </p>

<p> Local jails held more than 18,000 because of State prison
crowding </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, 21 jurisdictions reported a total of
18,191 State prisoners held in local jails or other facilities
because of crowding in State facilities (table 7). Four States,
Louisiana, New Jersey, Virginia, and Tennessee, accounted for
almost 60 of the prisoners sentenced to prison but incarcerated
locally. Four States, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Jersey, and
Mississippi, held more than 10% of their prison population
locally. Overall, 2.1% of the State prison population was
confined in local ails on December 31, 1992, because of prison
crowding. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare </p>

<p> The extent of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult
to determine precisely because of the absence of uniform measures
for defining capacity. A wide variety of capacity measures is in
use among the 52 reporting jurisdictions because capacity may
rflect both available space to house inmates and the ability to
staff and operate an institution. To estimate the capacity of the
Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to supply up to three
measures for yearend -- rated, operational, and design capaciies.
These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 42 provided operational capacities, and 35 submitted
design capacities. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lwest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-four
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity </p>

<p> Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently. Prison dormitories and cells need to be maintained
and repaired periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be
needed to cope with mergencies. At the end of 1992, 11 States
reported they were operating at 95% or below their highest
capacity. Forty-three jurisdictions and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> At the end of 1992, the Federal system was estimated to be
operating at 52% over capacity. State prisons were estimated to
be operating at 118% of their highest capacities and 131% of
their lowest capacities. </p>

<p> Rise in prison population linked to changes in prison
admissions </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth in the State prison population
during the 1980's were changes in the composition of prison
admissions. Since 1977 the relative sizes of the two principal
sources of admissions to prison, court commitments and returned
conditonal release violators, have changed. Court commitments
account for a decreasing share of all prison admissions: 68.0% in
1991, down from 84.3% in 1977 (table 10). As a percentage of all
admissions, those returning to prison after a conditional release
mre than doubled, from 14.5% to 30.5%. These conditional release
violators had originally left prison as parolees, mandatory
releases, and other types of releases involving communty
supervision. </p>

<p> The absolute number of conditional release violators returned
to prison grew 7-fold, from 19,617 in 1977 to 142,100 in 1991,
while the number of new court commitments nearly tripled, from
114,230 to 317,237. Overall, the increase in the number of
conditioal release violators accounted for more than a third of
the growth in the total admissions to State prisons. </p>

<p> An increasing percentage of court commitments sentenced for
drug offenses </p>

<p> In 1990, the latest year for which data are available, the
number of new court commitments for drug offenses reached a
record high, an estimated 103,800. For the first time, the number
of persons admitted for drug offenses was greater than the number
admited for property offenses (102,400), violent offenses
(87,200), or public-order offenses (26,200). An estimated 32.1%
of all new court commitments in 1990 were drug offenders, up from
11.5% in 1977 (figure 2). In 1990 an estimated 31.7% were
property offnders; 27.0%, violent offenders; and 8.1%,
public-order offenders. The increase in drug offenders admitted
to prison accounted for more than 40% of the total growth in new
court commitments since 1977. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of persons arrested for drug law
violations and an increase in the rate of incarceration for drug
offenses account for the change in the prison offense
distribution. Between 1977 and 1990, the estimated number of
adult arrests for dru law violations increased by 104.4%, from
493,300 to 1,008,300 (table 11). Compounding the impact of more
drug arrests, the rate of drug offenders sent to State prison
rose from 27 per 1,000 adult arrests for drug violations in 1977
to 103 admissions per ,000 in 1990. </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests and a rise in the probability
of incarceration for serious crimes </p>

<p> Growth in the prison population was not solely the result of
more commitments of drug offenders. Between 1977 and 1990 the
number of persons admitted to prison for selected serious
offenses, such as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, sexual
assault, robbey, aggravated assault, and burglary, also rose by
more than 50,000. </p>

<p> Regardless of the type of offense, the number of adults
arrested and the ratio of prison admissions to arrests increased
between 1977 and 1990. The total number of arrests for serious
crimes rose by 48.8%, from 592,400 to 881,300, while the ratio of
priso admissions to adult arrests for these crimes increased from
121 commitments per 1,000 arrests to 143. Although the prison
commitment ratio was higher in 1990 than in 1977, it changed from
year-to-year: increasing from 1978 to 1984, fluctuating between
195 and 1988, and then increasing after 1988. </p>

<p> Although the number of persons admitted to prison grew for
each of the five selected serious offenses, increases in the
number arrested for aggravated assault and in the probability of
incarceration for burglary accounted for much of the total
growth. </p>

<p> Growth in the number of arrests for aggravated assault
accounted for more than two-thirds of the total increase in
arrests for serious crimes. In 1990 an estimated 410,800 adults
were arrested for aggravated assault, up from 209,300 in 1977.
When combine with an increase in the probability of going to
prison from 32 per 1,000 arrests to 56 per 1,000, aggravated
assault accounted for nearly a third of the total increase in
prison admissions for serious offenses. </p>

<p> A rise in the prison admissions to arrest ratio for burglary
accounted for an additional 24% of the total increase in prison
admissions for serious offenses. While the annual number of
adults arrested for burglary grew by 42,000 between 1977 and
1990, thenumber of admissions to prison per 1,000 arrests
increased from 115 to 160. At least 13,000 more admissions to
prison for burglary occurred in 1990 than in 1977 because of the
higher rate of imprisonment. </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> Lawrence A. Greenfeld </p>

<p> Acting Director </p>

<p> By Allen J. Beck, Ph.D. </p>

<p> Thomas P. Bonczar </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Jurisdictions with large jail populations </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> Nearly a third of the large jurisdictions with a facility </p>

<p> conditions. Forty-one of the 503 jurisdictions were cited </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James </p>

<p> Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the </p>

<p> report. Marilyn Marbrook administered production, assisted </p>

<p> by Betty Sherman, Jayne Pugh, and Yvonne Boston. Collection </p>

<p> and processing of the 1992 Jail Survey were conducted by </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in its 9-year history, the Annual
</p>

<p> Survey of Jails collected information from the large </p>

<p> jurisdictions about the programs that their jails administer </p>

<p> -- boot camps, work release, alternatives to incarceration, </p>

<p> educational and treatment programs for inmates, and drug </p>

<p> testing. </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails and this Bulletin would not </p>

<p> have been possible without the generous cooperation of jail </p>

<p> administrators and staff whose facilities were selected for </p>

<p> the survey. </p>

<p> BJS Statisticians </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 local jails held an estimated 444,584 </p>

<p> persons. From July 1991 to June 1992, the number in jail </p>

<p> grew 4%, about the same rate as for the previous 12 months. </p>

<p> In 1992 overall jail occupancy was 99% of the rated capacity.
</p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails provides these findings from </p>

<p> data reported by 795 jurisdictions for 1,113 jails, about a </p>

<p> third of all jails. Local officials administer these </p>

<p> facilities which are able to hold persons for more than 48 </p>

<p> hours but usually for less than 1 year. </p>

<p> Other survey findings include: </p>

<p> *About 1 in every 428 adult U.S. residents were in jail on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. </p>

<p> *A majority of jail inmates were black or Hispanic. White </p>

<p> non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail population; </p>

<p> black non- Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non- Hispanic </p>

<p> inmates of other races, 1%. </p>

<p> *An estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992. The average daily juvenile population for the </p>

<p> year was 2,527. </p>

<p> *Based on the most recent census (1988) 503 jurisdictions had
</p>

<p> an average daily population of at least 100 jail inmates. In </p>

<p> 1992, these jurisdictions operated 814 jail facilities, which
</p>

<p> held 362,217 inmates, or about 81% of all jail inmates in the
</p>

<p> country. </p>

<p> One-day counts </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the estimated number of inmates held in </p>

<p> local jails was 444,584, an increase of 4.2% over the number </p>

<p> held on June 28, 1991. About 1 in every 428 adult residents </p>

<p> of the United States was in jail on June 30, 1992. Fewer </p>

<p> than 1% of the inmates of the Nation's jails in 1992 were </p>

<p> juveniles. </p>

<p> As estimated 2,804 juveniles were housed in adult jails </p>

<p> across the country on June 30, 1992. Most juveniles in </p>

<p> correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. (For </p>

<p> a definition of juveniles and discussion of their detention, </p>

<p> see Methodology, page 5.) </p>

<p> Since 1970 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents </p>

<p> has risen 120%, from 79 to 174. During the period, the </p>

<p> number of jail inmates at midyear increased more than 2 + </p>

<p> times, from 160,863 to 444,584. </p>

<p> The rates of incarceration in local jails have risen more </p>

<p> rapidly for blacks than whites. In 1984, the earliest year </p>

<p> for which data are available, the incarceration rate for </p>

<p> blacks was 339 jail inmates per 100,000 residents; by 1992, </p>

<p> the rate was 619. For whites, the rates increased from 68 to </p>

<p> 109 per 100,000. On June 30, 1992, local jails held an </p>

<p> estimated 195,200 blacks and 233,000 whites. </p>

<p> Average daily population </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, was 441,889, an increase of 4.6% from 1991. The </p>

<p> average daily population for males increased 4.7% from the </p>

<p> number in 1991; during the same period, the female average </p>

<p> daily population increased 2.8%. The average daily juvenile </p>

<p> population for the year ending June 30, 1992, was 2,527. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status </p>

<p> At midyear 1992, convicted inmates made up 49% of all adult </p>

<p> inmates. The number of convicted inmates increased 6% since </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Convicted inmates include those awaiting </p>

<p> sentencing or serving a sentence and those returned to jail </p>

<p> because they had violated the conditions of their probation </p>

<p> or parole. From 1991 to 1992 the number of unconvicted </p>

<p> inmates increased 3%. Unconvicted inmates include those on </p>

<p> trial or awaiting arraignment or trial. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics </p>

<p> Males accounted for 91% of the jail inmate population. The </p>

<p> adult male inmate population increased 4% from 1991 to 1992. </p>

<p> An estimated 1 in every 226 men and 1 in every 2,417 women </p>

<p> residing in the United States were in a local jail on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> White non-Hispanic inmates made up 40% of the jail </p>

<p> population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and </p>

<p> other races (Native Americans, Aleuts, Alaska Natives, </p>

<p> Asians, and Pacific Islanders), 1%. </p>

<p> Daily population movements </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, local jails had more than 46,000 new </p>

<p> admissions and discharges, about equally divided between the </p>

<p> two categories. Discharges include sentence completions, </p>

<p> bail, and deaths. These data exclude transfers among </p>

<p> facilities and readmissions or other departures on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, which can only be estimated to have been within the </p>

<p> range of 10,733 and 13,367. (For a discussion on reporting </p>

<p> practices, see Methodology.) </p>

<p> Occupancy </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates increased 4% from 1991, while the </p>

<p> total rated capacity of the Nation's jails rose 7%. Between </p>

<p> June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, the percentage of rated </p>

<p> capacity which was occupied fell 2 percentage points to 99%. </p>

<p> Facilities with the largest average daily populations </p>

<p> reported the highest occupancy rates. Occupancy was 114% of </p>

<p> rated capacity in facilities with an average daily population
</p>

<p> of 1,000 or more, compared to 53% in those with fewer than 20
</p>

<p> inmates. </p>

<p> Characteristics </p>

<p> In 1992 , an estimated 81% of the total annual number of </p>

<p> inmates in the Nation's local jails were housed in the </p>

<p> facilities of 503 jurisdictions, each with an average daily </p>

<p> population of at least 100 incarcerated persons at the time </p>

<p> of the 1988 Census of Jails. </p>

<p> Between June 28, 1991, and June 30, 1992, these jurisdictions
</p>

<p> held on average 356,471 inmates. On the day of the survey, </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, these large jurisdictions held 362,217. </p>

<p> Including an unspecified number of facilities counted as 1 in
</p>

<p> both Cook County (Chicago), Illinois, and Orleans Parish (New
</p>

<p> Orleans), Louisiana, these jurisdictions reported data on 814
</p>

<p> separate jail facilities -- 73% of all facilities surveyed. </p>

<p> Nearly half of these large jurisdictions maintained an </p>

<p> average daily population of between 100 and 299 inmates. </p>

<p> Although these jurisdictions represented 47% of all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, they held only 13% of the total annual number </p>

<p> of inmates in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> Twenty-nine jurisdictions reported an average daily </p>

<p> population of between 2,000 and 22,220 inmates. With an </p>

<p> average of more than 4 facilities per jurisdiction, they </p>

<p> accounted for 16% of all facilities and 41% of the total </p>

<p> average daily population in large jurisdictions. </p>

<p> 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> Within the group of jurisdictions that have an annual number </p>

<p> of inmates between 2,000 and 22,220 are the Nation's 25 </p>

<p> largest jurisdictions. These 25 jurisdictions were in 11 </p>

<p> States: 9 in California, 4 in Texas, 4 in Florida, and 1 </p>

<p> each in New York, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Arizona,
</p>

<p> Louisiana, Maryland, and Georgia. These jurisdictions had </p>

<p> between 1 and 16 jail facilities in their systems. </p>

<p> Six of the jurisdictions had a smaller average daily </p>

<p> population in 1992 than in 1991, and six had a smaller </p>

<p> population on June 30, 1992, than on June 28, 1991. Harris </p>

<p> County (Houston), Texas, reported the largest growth during </p>

<p> the year, an increase of 4,919 inmates on the day of the </p>

<p> survey. New York City reported the sharpest decline, a </p>

<p> decrease of 2,136 inmates. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, the 25 largest jurisdictions held 32% of </p>

<p> all jail inmates nationwide. The two largest jurisdictions, </p>

<p> Los Angeles County and New York City, had more than 40,700 </p>

<p> inmates, 9% of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the number of inmates in the Nation's 25 largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions on June 30, 1992, was 5% greater than on June </p>

<p> 28, 1991. The number of jail inmates in these jurisdictions </p>

<p> totalled 143,604, up from 132,506. </p>

<p> Inmates held for other authorities </p>

<p> Local jail jurisdictions frequently house inmates for other </p>

<p> authorities, because of crowding elsewhere or routine needs </p>

<p> of other jurisdictions, such as housing detainees pending </p>

<p> their transfer or holding convicted inmates while awaiting </p>

<p> transfer to State or Federal prison. Among the 503 </p>

<p> jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates in 1988, 425 were </p>

<p> holding inmates for other authorities in 1992. Approximately </p>

<p> 84% of these large jurisdictions had one or more jail </p>

<p> facilities holding inmates for other authorities on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992. </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the large jurisdictions were holding inmates </p>

<p> for State authorities; half for Federal authorities. </p>

<p> The number of jail inmates being held for other authorities </p>

<p> by these large jurisdictions increased by 9,063, up 23% from </p>

<p> 1991. The number of State prisoners in local jails grew the </p>

<p> most (31%), followed by the number of Federal prisoners </p>

<p> (22%). Prisoners held for other local authorities decreased </p>

<p> 26%, from 4,548 to 3,355. </p>

<p> Court orders to reduce population and improve conditions </p>

<p> At midyear 1992 more than a quarter of the 503 large </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported that 1 or more of their jail </p>

<p> facilities were under court order or consent decree to reduce
</p>

<p> the inmate population. On June 30, 1992, 131 jurisdictions </p>

<p> were under court orders to limit the number of inmates, down </p>

<p> from 135 in 1991. </p>

<p> Jail administrators in these 131 jurisdictions reported an </p>

<p> increase of 13% in their rated capacity during the year, or </p>

<p> an increase of 20,160 beds. On average these jurisdictions </p>

<p> were operating at about 105% of their rated capacities. </p>

<p> Administrators in the 372 jurisdictions not under orders to </p>

<p> reduce population or crowding reported less than 1% rise in </p>

<p> their rated capacity, and a slight increase in the occupancy </p>

<p> rate, from 104% to 105%. </p>

<p> Judges intervened most often in the operation of jails with </p>

<p> orders to reduce population or crowding, but they also cited </p>

<p> other elements of the jail facility, staff, operation, or </p>

<p> programs. Overall, 157 of the large jurisdictions were under </p>

<p> court order to limit population or to correct a specific </p>

<p> condition of confinement. Ninety-four were cited for two or </p>

<p> more conditions of confinement: </p>

<p> for the totality of conditions (that is, the cumulative </p>

<p> effect of several conditions). The most frequent condition </p>

<p> cited was crowded living units (118 jurisdictions), followed </p>

<p> by inadequate recreation facilities (62), medical facilities </p>

<p> or services (57), and staffing (53). </p>

<p> Fourteen fewer jurisdictions were under court order for </p>

<p> specific conditions of confinement on June 30, 1992, than on </p>

<p> June 28, 1991. Six fewer jurisdictions were under court </p>

<p> order for administrative segregation procedures or policies; </p>

<p> three fewer for recreation; and four fewer for food service. </p>

<p> Nine more jurisdictions were cited for grievance procedures </p>

<p> or policies; eight more for staffing patterns. </p>

<p> Jail programs and alternatives to incarceration </p>

<p> In 1992, for the first time in the history of the survey, </p>

<p> jurisdictions were asked if any of their jail facilities </p>

<p> operated a boot camp or daily work release program and if any
</p>

<p> operated alternative-to-incarceration programs, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, and day reporting. </p>

<p> (Jail jurisdictions reported only for the programs that they </p>

<p> operated. Within some counties other agencies may have </p>

<p> operated similar types of programs). These programs are </p>

<p> defined as follows: </p>

<p> boot camp -- a program having a chain of command, highly </p>

<p> regimented activity schedules, drill and ceremonies, and </p>

<p> stressing physical challenges, fitness, discipline and </p>

<p> personal appearance. </p>

<p> Work-release -- a program that allows an inmate to work in </p>

<p> the community unsupervised by correctional staff during the </p>

<p> day and return to jail at night. </p>

<p> Electronic monitoring -- a program in which offenders are </p>

<p> supervised by correctional authorities outside of the jail </p>

<p> facility by use of an electronic signalling device or </p>

<p> programmed contact device attached to a telephone. </p>

<p> House arrest (without electronic monitoring) -- a program in </p>

<p> which offenders are legally ordered to remain confined in </p>

<p> their own residence except for medical reasons and employment
</p>

<p> but are not subject to any electronic surveillance. </p>

<p> Day reporting -- a program that permits offenders to remain </p>

<p> in their residence at night and weekends while reporting to a
</p>

<p> correctional official one or more times daily. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 9 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating a boot camp program. About 4% of the jail inmates </p>

<p> (1,463) in these jurisdictions with boot camps were </p>

<p> participating in the program. Among inmates in all large </p>

<p> jurisdictions, fewer than half of one percent were in a boot </p>

<p> camp. </p>

<p> Daily work release programs were available to inmates in more
</p>

<p> than two-thirds of the large jurisdictions. On June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, 17,887 inmates in 359 jail jurisdictions were in a work
</p>

<p> release program. On that day, 7% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in work release programs. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1992, 180 of the 503 large jurisdictions were </p>

<p> operating an alternative-to-incarceration program, such as </p>

<p> electronic monitoring, house arrest, or day reporting. </p>

<p> Offenders in these programs are not considered jail inmates </p>

<p> to be included in the midyear count because they are not in </p>

<p> physical custody. They do not serve time in a jail facility </p>

<p> but would if not for these programs. </p>

<p> Of the differing types of alternative programs, electronic </p>

<p> monitoring was the most widely available and had the most </p>

<p> participants (118 jurisdictions and 4,582 offenders). Day- </p>

<p> reporting programs were offered in fewer jurisdictions (43) </p>

<p> and had fewer than 2,445 participants. House arrest programs </p>

<p> without electronic monitoring were operated by 18 jail </p>

<p> jurisdictions with a total of 602 participants. Other types </p>

<p> of alternative programs, such as community service and </p>

<p> weekend reporting, were available in 57 jurisdictions. More </p>

<p> than 6,100 offenders were participating in these other </p>

<p> alternatives. </p>

<p> About three-quarters of all jail inmates in boot camps were </p>

<p> in two jurisdictions -- Tarrant County (Fort Worth), Texas, </p>

<p> and New York City. Each of these jurisdictions had more </p>

<p> inmates in a boot camp than the other seven jurisdictions </p>

<p> combined. </p>

<p> Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties in California had the </p>

<p> largest number of jail inmates in daily work release </p>

<p> programs. Each of these jurisdictions had more than 1,000 </p>

<p> work release participants. </p>

<p> Riverside County, California, stretching to the Nevada border
</p>

<p> east of Los Angeles, had the most offenders (1,435) </p>

<p> participating in some type of alternative program. Cook </p>

<p> County (Chicago), Illinois, had the second largest number of </p>

<p> participants (1,223), and Orange County, California, </p>

<p> containing Anaheim and Santa Ana, the third largest number, </p>

<p> 1,050 offenders. More than 10% of offenders under the </p>

<p> supervision of these jail jurisdictions were in an </p>

<p> alternative-to-incarceration program. </p>

<p> Drug testing </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails asked the largest </p>

<p> jurisdictions if and on whom they conducted urinalysis tests </p>

<p> for drugs. Of all large jurisdictions, 308 said that they </p>

<p> did test. Jurisdictions were more likely to test upon </p>

<p> suspicion (219 jurisdictions) than testing all inmates at </p>

<p> least once (35 jurisdictions). The number of jurisdictions </p>

<p> that tested at random or on an inmate's return from the </p>

<p> community was about the same (159 and 153, respectively). </p>

<p> Jurisdictions holding between 2,000 and 3,999 inmates were </p>

<p> more likely to have at least 1 facility testing for drugs </p>

<p> than any other group, 93%. Those jurisdictions that had from </p>

<p> 100 to 199 inmates were least likely to test, 47%. </p>

<p> Selected jail programs </p>

<p> In the 1992 survey, the 503 largest jurisdictions were asked </p>

<p> to report on inmate participation in drug treatment, alcohol </p>

<p> treatment, psychological counseling or psychiatric care, and </p>

<p> educational programs offered by their jail facilities. On </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, at least 1 jail facility in 420 of these </p>

<p> jurisdictions reported operating these types of programs. A </p>

<p> total of 127 jurisdictions reported operating all 4 types of </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> Educational programs (including literacy, basic education, </p>

<p> and GED programs) were offered in more than two-thirds of the
</p>

<p> large jurisdictions. About 9% of the inmates in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions were participating in an education program at </p>

<p> the time of the survey. </p>

<p> Alcohol and drug treatment programs were offered in more than
</p>

<p> half of the large jail jurisdictions. On June 30, 1992, </p>

<p> 20,100 jail inmates were receiving alcohol treatment; 18,052 </p>

<p> were receiving drug treatment. In the jurisdictions </p>

<p> operating alcohol or drug treatment programs, the inmate </p>

<p> participation rate was lower than 10%. </p>

<p> Psychological or psychiatric counseling programs were </p>

<p> provided in 212 of the large jurisdictions. More than 14,000 </p>

<p> jail inmates were participating in these programs. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> A total of 178 large jail jurisdictions (35%) reported one or
</p>

<p> more jails with an inmate death during the year ending June </p>

<p> 30, 1992, compared to 190 (38%) the previous year . Natural </p>

<p> causes other than AIDS were the leading cause of death among </p>

<p> inmates in large jail jurisdictions (38%), followed by </p>

<p> suicide (28%). AIDS-related deaths accounted for 24% of the </p>

<p> total, injury by another person, 3%, and accidents or </p>

<p> undetermined causes, 7%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1992 Annual Survey of Jails was the ninth such survey in </p>

<p> a series sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The </p>

<p> first was conducted in 1982. Complete enumerations of the </p>

<p> Nation's jails are conducted every 5 years. Annual surveys - </p>

<p> - which collect data on all jails in jurisdictions with 100 </p>

<p> or more jail inmates and on a sample of all other jails -- </p>

<p> are carried out in each of the 4 years between the full </p>

<p> censuses. The reference date for the 1992 survey was June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. Full censuses were done on February 15, 1978, June </p>

<p> 30, 1983, and June 30, 1988. </p>

<p> A local jail is a facility that holds inmates beyond </p>

<p> arraignment, usually for more than 48 hours, and is </p>

<p> administered by local officials. Specifically excluded from </p>

<p> the count were temporary lockups that house persons for less </p>

<p> than 48 hours, physically separate drunk tanks, and other </p>

<p> holding facilities that did not hold persons after they had </p>

<p> been formally charged, Federal- or State-administered </p>

<p> facilities, and the combined jail-prison systems of Alaska, </p>

<p> Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Included in the universe were five locally operated jails in </p>

<p> Alaska and eight jails that were privately operated under </p>

<p> contract for local governments. </p>

<p> The 1992 survey included 1,113 jails in 795 jurisdictions. A </p>

<p> jurisdiction is a county, municipality, township, or regional
</p>

<p> authority that administers one or more local jails. The </p>

<p> jails in 503 jurisdictions were automatically included in the
</p>

<p> survey because the average daily inmate population in these </p>

<p> jurisdictions was 100 or more in the 1988 census. The </p>

<p> jurisdictions with large jail populations, referred to as </p>

<p> certainty jurisdictions, accounted for 814 jails and 362,217 </p>

<p> inmates, or 81% of the estimated inmate population on June </p>

<p> 30, 1992. </p>

<p> The other jurisdictions surveyed constituted a stratified </p>

<p> probability sample of those jurisdictions whose average daily
</p>

<p> population was less than 100 in the 1988 jail census. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Two followup </p>

<p> mailings and phone calls were used to encourage reporting. </p>

<p> The response rate was 99% for all jails. </p>

<p> For the eight jails in certainty jurisdictions and the one </p>

<p> jail in a noncertainty jurisdiction not responding to the </p>

<p> survey, data were adjusted by applying the average growth </p>

<p> factor for facilities in the same stratum and region with the
</p>

<p> same type of inmates (men, women, or both sexes). </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, </p>

<p> 1992, were produced by sex, race, legal status, and </p>

<p> conviction status and for the average daily population during
</p>

<p> the year ending June 30, 1992, by sex and legal status. </p>

<p> National estimates were also produced for rated capacity. </p>

<p> Administrators of jails in jurisdictions with large jail </p>

<p> populations provided counts of inmates held for other </p>

<p> authorities, inmate deaths, and jails under court order. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> National estimates have an associated sampling error because </p>

<p> jurisdictions with an average daily population of less than </p>

<p> 100 were sampled for the survey. Estimates based on a sample </p>

<p> survey are apt to differ somewhat from the results of a </p>

<p> survey canvassing all jurisdictions. Each of the samples </p>

<p> that could have been selected using the same sample design </p>

<p> could yield somewhat different results. Standard error is a </p>

<p> measure of the variation among the estimates from all </p>

<p> possible samples, stating the precision with which an </p>

<p> estimate from a particular sample approximates the average </p>

<p> result of all possible samples. The estimated relative </p>

<p> sampling error for the total inmate population of 444,584 on </p>

<p> June 30, 1992, was 0.47%. </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine </p>

<p> whether statistical significance could be associated with </p>

<p> observed differences between values. Differences were tested </p>

<p> to ascertain whether they were significant at the 95-percent </p>

<p> confidence level or higher. Differences mentioned in the </p>

<p> text meet or exceed this 95-percent confidence level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average </p>

<p> daily population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate </p>

<p> count on June 30 of each year. The average daily inmate </p>

<p> population balances out any extraordinary events that may </p>

<p> render the 1-day count atypical. The 1-day count is useful </p>

<p> because some characteristics of the inmate population -- such
</p>

<p> as race, Hispanic origin, and detention status -- can be </p>

<p> obtained for a specific date, but may not be available on an </p>

<p> annual basis. </p>

<p> Population movement </p>

<p> In contrast with prior years, admission and discharge data </p>

<p> were collected for the single day, June 30, 1992, rather than
</p>

<p> for the entire year preceding the census date to improve data
</p>

<p> quality and to ease reporting burdens. Intrasystem transfers </p>

<p> within jail systems have been removed from counts of </p>

<p> admissions and discharges and included with a combined </p>

<p> estimate of transfers between jails and long-term medical and
</p>

<p> mental health facilities and readmissions/other departures. </p>

<p> Because some jurisdictions do not maintain separate records </p>

<p> for returning inmates who were on temporary transfers to </p>

<p> other facilities or readmissions resulting from weekend </p>

<p> sentences, medical appointments, and court appearances, it </p>

<p> was only possible to provide an estimate of the volume of </p>

<p> this movement. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be </p>

<p> incarcerated in adult jails and prisons under a variety of </p>

<p> circumstances. Juveniles are persons who are defined by </p>

<p> State statute as being under a certain age, usually 18 years,
</p>

<p> and who are initially subject to juvenile court authority </p>

<p> even if tried as adults in criminal court. </p>

<p> The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 </p>

<p> requires sight and sound separation from adults for those </p>

<p> juveniles not tried as adults in criminal court but held in </p>

<p> adult jails. A 1980 amendment to that 1974 act requires the </p>

<p> removal of juveniles from local jails, except those juveniles
</p>

<p> who are tried as adults for criminal felonies. The </p>

<p> proportion of juveniles who were housed in adult jails in </p>

<p> accordance with these guidelines is not available. </p>

<p> This report was written by Allen J. Beck, Thomas P. Bonczar, </p>

<p> and Darrell K. Gilliard. Corrections statistics are prepared </p>

<p> under the general direction of Lawrence A. Greenfeld. James </p>

<p> Stephan reviewed the statistics. Tom Hester edited the </p>

<p> report. Marilyn Marbrook administered production, assisted </p>

<p> by Betty Sherman, Jayne Pugh, and Yvonne Boston. Collection </p>

<p> and processing of the 1992 Jail Survey were conducted by </p>

<p> Margaret Ferguson and Linda Huang under the supervision of </p>

<p> Alan Stevens, Governments Division, U.S. Bureau of the </p>

<p> The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of
Federal or State correctional authorities was 1,053,738 at
yearend 1994. During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 78,847 prisoners; the Federal system, 5,447.
Although the 1994 growth rate (8.6%) nearly equaled the average
annual percent increase since 1980, the total increase of 83,294
was the second largest yearly increase on record. </p>

<p> * California (125,605) and Texas (118,195) together held more
than 1 in every 5 inmates in the Nation. Seventeen States, each
holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together held 4% of all
prisoners. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1994, State prisons were operating at between
17% and 29% above capacity, while the Federal system was
operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> * Since 1980 the Nation's prison population more than doubled
on a per capita basis. On December 31, 1994, the number of
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents was 387-up from
139 in 1980. </p>

<p> * States with the highest incarceration rates were Texas
(636), Louisiana (530), and Oklahoma (508). North Dakota (78) had
the lowest rate, followed by Minnesota (100), West Virginia
(106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> * In 1993 (the latest available data), the incarceration rate
of blacks was 7 times that of whites. At yearend there were 1,471
black inmates per 100,000 black U.S. residents compared to 207
white inmates per 100,000 white residents. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The percentage of State prisoners serving a drug sentence
        increased almost 3-fold from 1980 to 1993 (6% to 22%).
        The percentage of Federal prisoners serving a drug
        sentence more than doubled, from 25% in 1980 to 60% in
        1993. </li>
    <li>In recent years, although the number of drug offenders in
        the Nation's prisons grew dramatically (55,500 from 1990
        to 1993), the number of violent offenders grew the most
        (up 82,100). </li>

<p> -------------------------------------- </p>

<p> State and Federal prisons housed two-thirds of all persons
incarcerated in the United States--the other third were in local
jails. </p>

<p> The 1994 growth rate of 8.6% was greater than the percentage
increase recorded during 1993 (7.4%). The 1994 increase
translates into a nationwide need to confine an additional 1,602
inmates each week. </p>

<p> Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year (referred to as
&quot;sentenced prisoners&quot;) accounted for 96% of the total
prison population at the end of 1994, growing by 8.6 % during the
year. The remaining prisoners had sentences of a year or less or
were unsentenced (for example, those awaiting trial in States
with combined prison-jail systems). </p>

<p> The number of sentenced Federal prisoners increased less than
that of sentenced State prisoners during 1994 (7.3% versus 8.7%).
The rate of increase slowed to about half the 1993 growth rate. </p>

<p> During 1994 prison populations increased in 16 States by at
least 10%. Texas reported the largest increase (28.5%), followed
by Georgia (20.3%), Nevada (16.0%), Virginia (14.6%), and
Wisconsin (14.1%). Three States and the District of Columbia
experienced less than 2% growth. The District had the smallest
percentage growth (.9%), followed by Oklahoma (1.4%), South
Carolina (1.6%), and Massachusetts (1.6%). </p>

<p> Fifty-six percent of the increase during 1994 was accounted
for by Texas (26,182), California (5,654), Georgia (5,642), the
Federal system (5,447), and Florida (4,091). These jurisdictions
incarcerate over 40% of the Nation's prison population. </p>

<p> * At yearend 1980, 1 in every 453 U.S. residents were
incarcerated; by yearend 1993, that figure grew to 1 in every
189. </p>

<p> * From 1980 to 1993, the total number of persons held in the
custody of State, Federal, and local jail jurisdictions grew by
about 863,000 persons. Sixty-two percent of the growth can be
attributed to the growth in number of State prisoners (533,000). </p>

<ul>
    <li>Between 1980 and 1993, the Federal prison population grew
        at faster rate (an average of 9.9% per year) than the
        combined State populations (8.2%) and the Nation's local
        jail populations (7.3%). Despite the higher growth rate,
        only 5.9% of all inmates were held in Federal prisons in
        1993, up from 4.7% in 1980. </li>
    <li>* On December 31, 1993, almost 4.9 million persons were
        under some form of correctional supervision, including
        2.8 million adults on probation and 671,000 on parole.
        The percentage distribution of the total corrections
        population was-- </li>

<p> Confinement 28.0% </p>

<p> Federal prisons 1.7 </p>

<p> State prisons 17.0 </p>

<p> Local jails 9.3 </p>

<p> Community supervision 72.0% </p>

<p> Parole 13.7 </p>

<p> Probation 58.3 </p>

<p> * Between 1980 and 1993, the number of persons under
correctional supervision increased by more than 3 million. About
19% of this increase occurred because of the growth in the State
and Federal prison populations. </p>

<p> * * * </p>

<p> Rates of incarceration increase </p>

<p> On December 31, 1994, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 387. Of the 14 States with rates
greater than the rate for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 2
were in the West, and 1 was in the Midwest. Four States, North
Dakota (78), Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine
(118) had rates that were less than a third of the national rate.
</p>

<p> The District of Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held
1,583 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents at yearend 1994.
Since 1980 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen from 139 to 387. During this period, per capita
incarceration rates rose the most in the South (from 188 to 451)
and West (from 105 to 333). The rate in the Northeast rose from
87 to 285, and the rate in the Midwest from 109 to 297. The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 residents
increased from 9 to 30 over the same period. </p>

<p> Prison populations in Southern States grew the fastest </p>

<p> During 1994 the average growth in the number of sentenced
State and Federal prisoners was equal to a demand for 1,542
additional bed spaces per week, about 179 more than the average
weekly growth in 1993. </p>

<p> Regionally, during 1994 the percentage increase in the number
of sentenced prisoners was highest in the Southern States, a gain
of 13.1%. The number of sentenced prisoners grew by 6.2% in the
West, 5.8% in the Midwest, and 4.1% in the Northeast. In 29
States the percentage change in the number of sentenced prisoners
during 1994 was higher than that of 1993. </p>

<p> Among these jurisdictions, 16 had increases of at least 10%.
They were led by Texas (28.3%), Georgia (20.1%), Virginia
(14.9%), New Hampshire (13.9%), and Idaho (13.7%). In five States
(Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Massachusetts)
and the District of Columbia the number of sentenced prisoners
increased by less than 2%. In two States--Alaska and
Connecticut--the number of sentenced prisoners declined during
1994. Since 1989 net gains in the number of sentenced prisoners
have averaged about 1,162 prisoners per week--a gain of about
1,036 State prisoners and 125 Federal prisoners per week over the
period. The largest net gains occurred in the South (500 inmates
per week), followed by the West (213 inmates per week), the
Midwest (180 inmates per week), and the Northeast (144 inmates
per week). Texas accounted for 34% of the total growth in the 16
Southern States and the District of Columbia. California
accounted for two-thirds of the growth in the 13 Western States. </p>

<p> In 1994 the 10 States with the largest prison populations
held 55% of the total prison population nationwide, with
California, Texas, and New York accounting for nearly 30%. Texas
had the highest incarceration rate, with 636 sentenced prisoners
per 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana (530) and Oklahoma
(508). </p>

<p> During 1994 the prison population in Texas grew the fastest,
increasing 28.5%. Over the past 5 years the State prison
population of New Hampshire grew the fastest, increasing 73.3%.
At yearend 1994 North Dakota had the lowest rate of incarceration
(78 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents), followed by
Minnesota (100), West Virginia (106), and Maine (118). </p>

<p> Seventeen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates,
together held 4% of all prisoners in 1994. </p>

<p> The number of sentenced inmates has increased in every State
since 1989. Alaska (up 1.4% since 1989) and Maine (up 2.2%) had
the smallest percentage increases. Four other States had
increases of less than 20% in the last 5 years. Kansas had a
5-year rate of growth of 13.5%, followed by Nebraska (13.7%), New
Mexico (17.9%), and Wyoming (18.6%). </p>

<p> Female prisoner population grew at a faster pace The number
of female inmates (64,403) increased at a faster rate during 1994
(10.6%) than the number of male inmates (989,335 at 8.5%). </p>

<p> At the end of 1994 women accounted for 6.1% of all prisoners
nationwide. Relative to the number of women in the resident
population in the States in 1994, Oklahoma (with 96 female
inmates per 100,000 female residents) and Texas (with 94) led the
Nation. North Dakota (5 per 100,000) and Maine (9) had the lowest
female incarceration rates. In 1994, 28 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal system had more than 500 female
inmates. Among these jurisdictions, 14 had increases of at least
10%, led by the Texas increase of 27.2% (from 6,949 in 1993 to
8,839 in 1994). </p>

<p> Six States held fewer than 100 female inmates at yearend
1994. Women represented less than 4% of all prisoners in North
Dakota, Montana, and Vermont. In 1994, 7.5% of inmates in the
Federal system were female--higher than all State systems except
for Oklahoma (9.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), and Texas (7.5%). </p>

<p> Local jails held almost 49,000 prisoners because of State
prison crowding At the end of 1994, 23 jurisdictions reported a
total of 48,949 State prisoners held in local jails or
otherfacilities because of crowding in State facilities. Texas
accounted for 42% of the prisoners sentenced to prison but
incarcerated locally. Eight States--Louisiana, Texas, Virginia,
West Virginia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee, and
Idaho--held more than 10% of their prison population in local
jails. Overall, because of prison crowding, 4.6% of the State
prisoners were confined in local jails, down from 5.2% in 1993. </p>

<p> Prison capacity estimates are difficult to compare The extent
of crowding in the Nation's prisons is difficult to determine
because of the absence of uniform measures for defining capacity.
The 52 reporting jurisdictions apply a wide variety of capacity
measures to reflect both available space to house inmates and the
ability to staff and operate an institution. To estimate the
capacity of the Nation's prisons, jurisdictions were asked to
supply three measures for yearend 1994: rated, operational, and
design capacities. These measures were defined as follows: </p>

<p> Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and
services. </p>

<p> Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. </p>

<p> Of the 52 reporting jurisdictions, 38 supplied rated
capacities, 43 provided operational capacities, and 37 submitted
design capacity. As a result, estimates of total capacity and
measures of the relationship to population are based on the
highest and lowest capacity figures provided. (Twenty-five
jurisdictions reported 1 capacity measure or gave the same figure
for each capacity measure they reported.) </p>

<p> Most jurisdictions are operating above capacity Prisons
generally require reserve capacity to operate efficiently.
Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and repaired
periodically, special housing is needed for protective custody
and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope with
emergencies. At the end of 1994, 13 States and the District of
Columbia reported that they were operating at or below 99% of
their highest capacity. Forty-one States, the District of
Columbia and the Federal prison system reported operating at 100%
or more of their lowest capacity. By yearend, the Federal system
was estimated to be operating at 25% over capacity. </p>

<p> State prisons were estimated to be operating at 117% of their
highest capacity and 129% of their lowest capacity. </p>

<p> Changing demographic characteristics </p>

<p> The demographic characteristics of the Nation's prison
population are changing. Since 1980 the number of female inmates
in the Nation's prisons has increased at a faster rate (up an
average 12.0% per year) than the number of male inmates (up an
average 8.5% per year.) Despite their faster population growth,
females comprised only 6% of all sentenced prisoners at yearend
1994. In 1994 the male incarceration rate, 746 per 100,000 male
residents, was more than 16 times higher than the female
incarceration rate--45 per 100,000 female residents. Increasing
percentages of State and Federal inmates are from racial or
ethnic minority groups. Between 1980 and 1993, the latest
available data, the percent of sentenced inmates who were black
rose from 46.5% to 50.8%. Relative to the number of residents in
the U.S. population, blacks at yearend 1993 were 7 times more
likely than whites to have been incarcerated in a State or
Federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per 100,000 black
residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were
incarcerated in the Nation's prisons on December 31, 1993. </p>

<p> The number of prisoners with sentences of more than a year
rose 616,292 between 1980 and 1993 (up 195%). The number of white
males grew 163%, the number of black males 217%, the number of
white females 327%, and the number of black females 343%. </p>

<p> The growth in the number of black male prisoners (304,800)
accounted for nearly half of the total increase during the
13-year period. </p>

<p> Hispanics, who may be of any race, are the fastest growing
minority group--increasing from 7.7% of all State and Federal
inmates in 1980 to 14.3% in 1993. During this period, the
Hispanic incarceration rate more than tripled--from 163 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 Hispanic residents in 1980 to 529 per
100,000 Hispanic residents in 1993. At yearend 1993 nearly
139,000 Hispanics were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The total number of Hispanic inmates may actually be somewhat
larger. Because of variations in record keeping, some States are
unable to report data on Hispanic origin; other States report
estimates only; and others report only partial counts. Data from
past surveys of State inmates, which are based on inmate
self-identification during personal interviews, produce higher
estimates of the number of Hispanic inmates. </p>

<p> On December 31, 1993, nearly two-thirds of all sentenced
prison inmates were black, Asian, Native American, or Hispanic.
Growth linked to increasing numbers of inmates in prison for
violent and drug offenses </p>

<p> The distribution of the four major offense
categories--violent, property, drug, and public-order
offenses--changed dramatically in the Nation's prison population
between 1980 and 1993. As a percentage of all State and Federal
inmates, violent offenders fell from 57% in 1980 to 45% in 1993,
property offenders fell from 30% to 22%, drug offenders rose from
8% to 26%, and public-order offenders rose from 5% to 7%. </p>

<p> The rise in the number of drug offenders was the greatest
among Federal inmates. Prisoners sentenced for drug law
violations were the single largest group of Federal inmates (60%)
in 1993, up from 25% in 1980. The increase in drug offenders
accounted for nearly three-quarters of the total growth in
Federal inmates. </p>

<p> The percentage of inmates in State prison for a drug crime
also rose significantly, from 6% in 1980 to 22% in 1993. Nearly
10 times as many inmates were serving time in State prisons for
drug offenses in 1993 (186,000) as in 1980 (19,000). </p>

<p> In absolute numbers, however, the growth in State inmates was
greatest among violent offenders. Between 1980 and 1993, the
number of violent offenders grew by 221,200, while the number of
drug offenders grew by 167,000. As a percentage of the total
growth in sentenced State inmates during the period, violent
offenders accounted for 42% of the total growth, drug offenders
31%, property offenders 19%, and public-order offenders 7%. </p>

<p> Average sentence length and time served for State inmates
relatively unchanged </p>

<p> Data on prison admissions and releases collected annually in
the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) suggest that
growth in the State prison populations has not been the result of
longer sentences. (Each year participating States provide
information on sentencing and time served for persons entering or
leaving prison. In 1993, 38 States and the District of Columbia
submitted data, accounting for nearly 93% of all admissions and
85% of all releases nationwide during the year.) Between 1985 and
1992, years in which comparable data are available, the average
(mean) maximum sentences of prisoners actually declined from 78
months to 67 months. </p>

<p> The median sentence length (the 50th percentile) of prisoners
admitted from court remained constant at 48 months. Moreover,
despite the increasing use of mandatory minimums and sentencing
enhancements during the period, the percent of inmates who
received a maximum sentence of 10 years or longer actually
declined (from 19.7% in 1985 to 17.7% in 1992). </p>

<p> The NCRP data also reveal no significant changes in the time
served by offenders released from State prison during the period.
In 1992 State prisoners released for the first time on their
current offense (that is, first releases) served an average of 22
months in prison and 5 months in jail. (Time served in jail is
the amount of time an inmate spends in jail prior to entering
State prison and is credited towards time served on the total
sentence.) The amount of time served in prison was slightly lower
in 1985 (20 months), higher in 1986 (24 months), and about the
same since 1987 (22 months). </p>

<p> These data reflect the time served by prisoners actually
released. Some prisoners will never be released but will die in
prison. Some prisoners with very long sentences do not show up
among released prisoners for many years. As a result, measures of
time served based on released prisoners tend to understate the
actual time to be served by persons entering prison. </p>

<p> Changing Federal sentencing linked to population growth </p>

<p> The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 introduced &quot;truth in
sentencing&quot; to the Federal justice system. The Act created a
commission that specified sentencing guidelines, which went into
effect in late 1987. The guidelines took into account the gravity
of the crime and the offender's criminal record. Under the
guidelines offenders convicted of Federal offenses are expected
to serve a minimum of 85% of the actual sentence. </p>

<p> After 1986 the average Federal sentence to prison for violent
crimes decreased, while overall time served increased. The result
is a rapidly growing Federal prison population. After 1986 the
average time served by persons released from Federal prison rose
from 15 months to 24 months (a 60% increase). For violent
offenses, the time served by first releases increased from 50
months to 56 months and for drug offenses, time served increased
from 22 months to 33 months. </p>

<p> The sentencing reforms also increased the likelihood of
incarceration for convicted Federal offenders. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the number of defend-ants convicted in
U.S. district courts rose from 29,943 to 51,936, and the
percentage sent to prison increased from 46% to 75%. As a result,
the number of offenders sent to Federal prisons rose from 13,766
to 33,622--an increase of 144%. (&quot;Federal Criminal Case
Processing, 1980-90,&quot; September 1992, NCJ-136945;
&quot;Federal Criminal Case Processing, 1982-91, With Preliminary
Data for 1992,&quot; November 1993, NCJ-144526.) </p>

<p> Rise in State prison population the result of increasing
number of arrests and higher probabilities of incarceration </p>

<p> Underlying the growth in the State prison population has been
an increase in the number of arrests from nearly 8.3 million
adult arrests in 1980 to 11.6 million in 1993. Although the total
grew by nearly 41%, for some offenses the percent increase was
substantially greater: simple assault (139%), drug abuse
violations (116%), aggravated assault (86%). Compounding the
impact of more adult arrests for selected serious offenses, the
rate of sending offenders to prison rose between 1980 and 1992
(the latest year for which data are available). Except for murder
and nonnegligent manslaughter, the number of admissions to State
prison per 1,000 arrests for serious crimes rose significantly.
The likelihood of incarceration upon arrest increased 5-fold for
drug violations, increased 4-fold for weapons offenses, and
doubled for larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and sexual
assault other than rape. </p>

<p> As a result of the compounding nature of these factors, the
number of admissions to State prisons from court rose from
131,215 sentenced prisoners in 1980 to 318,069 in 1993, an
increase of 142%. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> National Prisoner Statistics </p>

<p> This Bulletin is based on an advance count of prisoners
conducted for the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program
immediately after the end of each calendar year. A detailed,
final count containing any revisions to the jurisdictions'
advance count will be published later. </p>

<p> Most States provide jurisdiction counts, that is, the number
of inmates under their jurisdiction on December 31, regardless of
the location of their inmates. These counts exclude inmates
housed for other jurisdictions, such as other State's inmates and
pretrial detainees, that are housed in a jurisdiction's
facilities. </p>

<p> Some States provide custody counts, that is, the number of
inmates housed in State facilities regardless of jurisdiction.
(See Jurisdiction notes.) These counts exclude inmates housed
outside of each State's prison facilities, such as inmates housed
in local jails. Custody counts are used to calculate the total
number of inmates in prisons and jails. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> The offense distributions of State prisoners at yearend were
estimated for 1980, 1985, and 1990-93. To obtain estimates of the
custody populations by offense, data from inmate surveys
conducted in 1979, 1986, and 1991, were combined with counts by
offense of annual admissions and releases. The surveys provided
the basis for estimating the offense distributions of the other
years. </p>

<p> The offense distributions were estimating using forward and
backward stock-flow procedures as outlined in Correction
Populations in the United States, 1992 (January 1995,
NCJ-146413). Data from the 1979 survey were used for forward
estimates for 1980; data from the 1986 survey (conducted in March
1986) were used for 1985 estimates, 1990 forward estimates, and
1980 backward estimates; and data from the 1991 survey for 1991
estimates and 1992-93 forward estimates. </p>

<p> To obtain flow populations for each year, the offense
distributions of admissions and releases were drawn from annual
reports of the National Prisoner Statistics (1980-82) program and
the National Corrections Reporting Program (1983-92). Data from
the 1992 NCRP were used to estimate flows for 1993. </p>

<p> The offense distributions of Federal inmates are for
prisoners of any sentence length on September 30 in 1980 and
1985. Data for 1990-93 are taken from the BJS Federal justice
database. </p>

<p> Jurisdiction notes </p>

<p> Federal--The rated capacity of Federal facilities on December

<p> Indiana--Prison population counts include 903 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. Another floor was opened in a
facility to accommodate a larger number of inmates; as a result,
capacity was increased and some crowding was reduced. </p>

<p> Iowa--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Maine--Maine has a number of inmates serving concurrent
sentences some of which are 1 year or more and some 1 year or
less. These inmates are not included in the prison population
counts. </p>

<p> Maryland--Population totals are actual manual counts;
however, the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. </p>

<p> Massachusetts--Population counts are based on jurisdictional
data for the first time. For this report custody counts for
December 31, 1993, were updated to jurisdictional counts.
Population counts exclude the 963 inmates housed in local jails
because of crowding of State facilities. Population totals are
actual counts, however, the male/female breakdown is an estimate
believed to be within 0.05% of the actual counts. Population
counts include 336 inmates without sentence information. </p>

<p> Michigan--Population counts are based on custody data. </p>

<p> Minnesota--Population counts include 85 inmates housed in
local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

<p> Mississippi--Population counts are as of December 30, 1994.
Population counts include 1,569 inmates housed in local jail as
of December 30, 1994, because of crowding. </p>

<p> New Jersey--&quot;Design&quot; capacity does not include
persons held in halfway houses (686) and persons held under the
county assistance program (846). </p>

<p> North Carolina--While population totals are actual counts,
the breakdowns for sentence length are estimates. Because of
crowding 248 male inmates were housed in local jails; another 937
male inmates were housed in private prisons out of State on a
contractual basis. The total of 1,185 male inmates are included
in the population counts. </p>

<p> Oklahoma--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1
year maximum sentence&quot; may include a small undetermined

<p> Oregon--An undetermined number of inmates for which sentence
length is unknown is included in the count for &quot;Inmates with
a sentence of 1 year or less.&quot; </p>

<p> Pennsylvania--The design capacity figure increased because
several sections in different facilities opened. This State now
treats the rated, operational, and design capacity the same. </p>

<p> Rhode Island--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.
All NPS data include prison and jail populations. </p>

<p> South Carolina--Population counts include 359 inmates who
were housed in local jails as of December 31, 1994, because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Tennessee--Population counts for &quot;Inmates with over 1

jails because of overcrowding and exclude an undetermined number
offelons sentenced to serve their time in local jails. (The State
pays to house these felons, but the local court maintains
jurisdiction.) These counts are based on a jail report from
December 16, 1994. </p>

<p> Texas--Population counts for December 31, 1994, include
20,720 inmates housed in local jails because of crowding. In
Texas the minimum sentence for any offender sentenced to a State
prison is 2 years. </p>

<p> Utah--Population counts include 169 inmates housed in local
jails because of crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> Vermont--Prisons and jails form an integrated system. All NPS
data include prison and jail populations. Some county and
municipal authorities operate local &quot;lockups.&quot; NPS data
include the inmates in local &quot;lockups&quot;. Population
counts for sentenced inmates include 305 who were on long-term
furlough. The rated capacity figures decreased due to the closing
of one facility for renovations. </p>

<p> Virginia--Virginia uses a base capacity method to determine
the rated, operational, and design capacity figures. Under this
method of determining capacity, only the bunks that touch the
floor are counted; top bunks are not counted. Population counts
include 4,508 inmates who were housed in local jails because of
crowding of State facilities. </p>

<p> West Virginia--Population counts are based oncustody data.
Population counts exclude 383 male and 15 female inmates housed
in county or regional jails because of crowding of State
facilities. </p>

<p> Washington--Offenders sentenced to 1 year or less and
unsentenced offenders reside in county jails. Capacities reported
exclude state work release and pre-release facilities which
housed 918 inmates on December 31, 1994. These facilities'
capacity of 1,102 inmates are not specifically reserved for State
prison inmates. These facilities are for prison inmates,
parolees, probationers, and offenders serving partial confinement
sentences. <br>

<p> The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails on
June 30, 1994, reached a record high of 490,442. Local jails,
which are operated by counties and municipalities and
administered by local government agencies, housed about a third
of all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at midyear 1994; the
other two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons. </p>

<p> The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1,
1993, and June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increase
recorded since 1983. The 12-month increase was the equivalent of
a 6.7% rate of growth. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were
collected, the number of local jail employees grew at a faster
rate than the number of inmates. During this period, the number
of jail inmates increased at an annual rate of 7.5%, while the
number of full-time and part-time jail employees grew at an
annual rate of 10%. By midyear 1993, local jails employed an
estimated 165,500 persons. </p>

<p> Highlights </p>

<p> After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates in
local jails reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994 </p>

<p> * The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents
increased from 96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994. </p>

<p> * In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per
100,000 residents: Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307),
Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222),
and Nevada (215). </p>

<p> * Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased
106%; the total jail staff increased 156%; and the number of
correctional officers grew 165%. </p>

<p> * At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
was 504,324 inmates, as measured by the number of beds allotted
by State or local rating officials. </p>

<p> * The jail population was 97% of rated capacity. Jail space
increased 93% between 1983 and 1994. </p>

<p> * White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population;
black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics of
other races, 2%. </p>

<p> Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail population
included: </p>

<p> * an increase in adult arrests </p>

<p> * a growth in jail admissions </p>

<p> * an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails </p>

<p> * an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted of
drug offenses </p>

<p> * more inmates held in jails because of crowded State or
Federal facilities. </p>

<p> Data sources </p>

<p> The data in this report are based on results from the 1993
Census of Jails and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5
years the jail census collections provide detailed information on
local jail inmates, staff, facilities, and programs. Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.
Beginning in 1982 and in years between each jail census, a sample
of jails has been surveyed to obtain basic information on inmates
and jail capacity. These annual surveys provide national-level
estimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (See
Methodology at end.) </p>

<p> As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories. </p>

<p> Jails-- </p>

<p> * receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing </p>

<ul>
    <li>readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
        absconders </li>
    <li>* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to
        juvenile authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities </p>

<p> * hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses </p>

<ul>
    <li>release convicted inmates to the community upon
        completion of sentence </li>
    <li>* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other
        authorities </li>
</ul>

<p> * relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities </p>

<p> * sometimes operate community-based programs with electronic
monitoring or other types of supervision. </p>

<p> Not included in the survey or census are inmates in six
States with combined jail and prison systems. At midyear 1994
these States-Alaska (except for 5 local jails), Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont--held nearly 6,000
inmates who were unsentenced or had sentences of less than a
year. These inmates and the facilities that house them are
included in BJS prison statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time,
seven Federal facilities that perform the pretrial functions of
local jails. Data on these Federal facilities and inmates are
reported separately. (See the section on Federal jails.) </p>

<p> Local jail inmates </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, an
increase of 6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993. The jail
population grew by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-month
period, the third largest increase ever recorded. </p>

<p> Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a
per capita basis. During this period, the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188. At midyear 1994 about
1 in every 398 adult residents of the United States was in a
local jail. </p>

<p> An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 30, 1994. Over three-quarters of them had been
convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal
court. Most juveniles in correctional custody are housed in
juvenile facilities. </p>

<p> Who is a juvenile? </p>

<p> Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person under
age 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. Exceptions
usually depend on offense severity or an offender's adjudication
history. In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reporting
uniformity, jail authorities were asked to report the number of
inmates under age 18. Of the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% were
identified as juveniles tried or scheduled to be tried as adults.
Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to be
held in adult jails. Often juveniles accused of acts that are
crimes for adults may be held in local jails or police lockups,
given certain conditions: </p>

<p> * separated by sight and sound from the general population </p>

<p> * held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours. </p>

<p> Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specified
for them. In 1993 about 96,000 were in public and private
juvenile detention and correctional facilities. </p>

<p> The average daily population for the year ending June 30,
1994, was 479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993. Between 1983
and 1993, when separate counts by sex were collected, the average
daily population of female inmates grew at a faster rate (up
11.1% per year) than the average daily population of adult male
inmates (up 7.1% per year). </p>

<p> States with the largest jail populations </p>

<p> In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of all
local jail inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395),
Florida (34,183), New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).
Twenty-one States reported a jailpopulation that more than
doubled between 1983 and 1993, with growth ranging from 103% in
Maryland to 264% in Texas. </p>

<p> States that had the largest number of jail inmates per
100,000 residents in 1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328),
Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida (250), Virginia (225),
California (222), and Nevada (215). States with a jail
incarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per
100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota and
Montana (81), and South Dakota (87). </p>

<p> The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the South
and the least in the Midwest. From 1983 to 1993 the inmate
population grew 135% in the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% in
the West, and 79% in the Midwest. </p>

<p> For the Nation a declining number of jails held these
increasing numbers of inmates. In 1993 the total of 3,304
facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years before and 34 fewer than in
1983. </p>

<p> Facility size and the percentage of the inmate population
held </p>

<p> A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of the
Nation's jail inmates. About 6% of the jail facilities housed
more than half of all jail inmates on June 30, 1993. Facilities
with an average daily population of 500 or more during the annual
period ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of local jail inmates.
Facilities with an average daily population of fewer than 50
persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of all
inmates. </p>

<p> Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates </p>

<p> Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate population
at midyear 1994, down from 93% in 1983. An estimated 1 in every
212 adult men and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in a
local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were black
or Hispanic. White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other
races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska
Natives), 2%. </p>

<p> Relative to the number of residents in the U.S. population,
black non-Hispanics were more than twice as likely as Hispanics,
nearly 7 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, and over 9
times more likely than persons of other races to have been held
in a local jail on June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Hispanic 75,500 290 </p>

<p> Other race 7,700 74 </p>

<p> Note: U.S. resident populations were estimated. Inmate counts
were adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100.
Rates were based on relevant population subgroups. </p>

<p> Adult conviction status, mid-1993 </p>

<p> On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, at
least half the Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted on
their current charge. Convicted inmates include those awaiting
sentencing, serving a sentence, or returned to jail for a
violation of probation or parole. Between 1983 and 1993 the
reported number of convicted inmates more than doubled (from
107,660 to 226,600). The number of jail inmates awaiting court
disposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900). </p>

<p> In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than male
inmates to have been convicted. Among adult female inmates, 52%
had been convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% of
the male inmates. </p>

<p> Rated capacity and percent occupied At midyear 1994, the
rated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled 504,324. Rated
capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by
State or local rating officials to each jail facility. During the
12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds were
added. Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since
1983. </p>

<p> As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity was
occupied. As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed
in jail facilities to the rated capacity, the percent of capacity
actually occupied may have been somewhat lower than 97%. Included
among the total jail inmates were an unknown number of inmates
housed outside of jail facilities--under electronic monitoring,
on house arrest, under other kinds of community supervision, or
temporarily in hospitals or treatment centers. </p>

<p> As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent of
capacity occupied increased considerably after 1983, reaching a
record 108% in 1989 and then falling to 97% in 1993. Since 1989
rated capacity has risen by nearly 137,000 beds, while the number
of inmates has increased by 95,000. </p>

<p> In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in
eight States and the District of Columbia. </p>

<p> Percent of jail </p>

<p> State capacity occupied </p>

<p> --------------------------------------- </p>

<p> Virginia 160% </p>

<p> South Carolina 124 </p>

<p> District of Columbia 121 </p>

<p> New Jersey 120 </p>

<p> Texas 115 </p>

<p> California 113 </p>

<p> Massachusetts 106 </p>

<p> Washington 102 </p>

<p> Pennsylvania 101 </p>

<p> In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail
population was below 75% of the combined capacity of all local
jails. The lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (43%),
followed by Wyoming (52%), South Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%).
Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jails
increased by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224. In eight States
the capacity of local jails increased by more than 60% during the
5-year period. Jails in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
experienced the largest percentage increase in capacity. During
this period the combined capacities of jails declined in the
following jurisdictions: West Virginia, Montana, and the District
of Columbia. </p>

<p> In every census year, facilities with the largest average
daily populations have reported the highest occupancy rates. In
1993 occupancy was 111% of rated capacity in jails with an
average population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% in
those with fewer than 50 inmates. </p>

<p> The 25 largest jail jurisdictions </p>

<p> In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted
for 30% of all jail inmates. The jurisdictions were in 12 States:
7 in California; 5 in Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in New
York, Illinois, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. </p>

<p> New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largest
number of facilities. </p>

<p> The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles
County and New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8%
of the national total. </p>

<p> Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had a
total population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 a
year earlier. </p>

<p> In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger average
daily population than in 1993. </p>

<p> Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single year
growth--2,123 inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to
1994--5,494. Shelby County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported the
largest decrease from 1993 to 1994--1,327 inmates. </p>

<p> Local jail employees </p>

<p> Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30,
1993. Including all full-time and part-time, payroll and
nonpayroll staff, the total staff grew by more than 100,000
between 1983 and 1993, an increase of 156%. </p>

<p> The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, the
employees most responsible for providing a secure environment and
for directly supervising inmates. Correctional officers comprised
about 7 in every 10 jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. </p>

<p> Characteristics of local jail staff </p>

<p> At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and
76% of correctional officers. Excluded were nonpayroll jail
employees, such as teachers or counselors, who were paid by
agencies other than jails. </p>

<p> Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearly
doubled, from 25,642 to an estimated 48,000. In 1993 nearly a
third of all paid staff and a quarter of correctional officers
were women. The race and ethnic composition of jail staff
remained unchanged between 1988 and 1993. White employees made up
an estimated 71% of the payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69%
of the correctional officers. </p>

<p> Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of the
correctional officers. Hispanics accounted for 6% of the total
paid staff and 7% of correctional officers. </p>

<p> Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 </p>

<p> From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased
156%, as the number of correctional officers went up 165%. Jail
staffs in the Northeast had the largest percentage
increases--more than tripling in 10 years--while those in the
Midwest had the smallest, more than doubling. The South, the
region with the largest number of jail employees, registered the
greatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993. The West, with
less than half the number of employees in the South, also had the
least growth in staff (50%). Throughout the period, 1983-93, the
jail staff in the Nation and in every region grew more rapidly
than the inmate population. In 1993 jails held 2.8 inmates per
employee. The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower than the 3.4
inmates per employee in 1988. </p>

<p> As a measure of workload, the number of inmates per
correctional officer also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in
1993. All four regions had decreases in inmate-to-correctional
officer ratios. The West reported the sharpest decline, from 7.1
inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3 in 1993. The smaller
facilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) than
did larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a
1,000 or more inmates). The jails that were operating with an
inmate population at least 10% over their rated capacity had an
inmate-to-correctional officer ratio almost twice that of jails
with less than 75% of capacity occupied. Jails with 91% to 110%
of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for more than
every 4 inmates. </p>

<p> Annual jail expenditures </p>

<p> Local jails throughout the United States spent a total of
slightly over $9.6 billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.
This estimated total (not adjusted for inflation) was more than
double the $2.7 billion spent in 1983. </p>

<p> Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able to
provide data on expenditures in 1993. These jails reported total
annual expenditures were nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs,
about $5.5 billion; and capital expenditures, $2.2 billion. </p>

<p> Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employee
benefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and
other current operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.
Construction costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, land
purchases, and other capital outlays accounted for the remaining
29%. In 1988, operating costs made up 78% of all expenditures and
capital outlays, 22%. </p>

<p> Average operating cost per inmate </p>

<p> Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keep
one jail inmate incarcerated for a year was $14,667. Over 10
years the cost per inmate had risen 57% from $9,360. (Adjusted
for inflation to 1983 dollars the annual cost per inmate had
decreased by 11%.) The Northeast had the highest average
operating expenditure per inmate ($22,678) and the South, the
lowest ($11,697). Excluding Alaska and the District of Columbia,
average annual operating costs per inmate by State were highest
in New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014). </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deaths
occurred in the jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provided
data on such deaths. Although asked to report the death of
inmates under the jurisdiction of jail authorities, regardless of
where the death took place, some facilities could report only
deaths that occurred on the jail premises. In addition, about 10%
of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths had
occurred in 1993. </p>

<p> In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails
(45%), followed by suicide (36%). Acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmate
deaths; homicide, 3%; and other causes, 6%. </p>

<p> The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a third
between 1983 and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates. While
the rate of death from illness, including AIDS, remained
relatively constant over the period, the rate of suicide declined
sharply, from 129 per 100,000 in 1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in
1993. </p>

<p> Federal jails </p>

<p> In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a small
number of detention facilities that functioned as jails. These
were not counted among the city, county, or regional adult
detention facilities called local jails in this report. Local
facilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for Federal
authorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.
At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding
5,899 persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving a
sentence, usually of a year or less. </p>

<p> Inmate demographics </p>

<p> Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, a
slightly higher proportion than in local jails (90%). Seventy-two
percent were white, 25% were black, and 3% were Asians, Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, or Alaska Natives. </p>

<p> Conviction status </p>

<p> Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates were
unconvicted and were awaiting arraignment, trial, or the
completion of their trial. </p>

<p> Facility capacity </p>

<p> The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of
3,810-the population being 155% of that capacity. The percent
occupied was about 50% higher than that of local jails of
comparable size. </p>

<p> Inmate deaths </p>

<p> Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal
jail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 1993.
Four deaths resulted from illness or natural causes, two were
suicides, and two were drug overdoses. </p>

<p> Staff </p>

<p> Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, a
higher percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.
A majority of the Federal jail employees were correctional
officers. </p>

<p> Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federal
jails, about the same as in local facilities where the ratio was
2.8 inmates per employee. However, the number of inmates per
correctional officer (5.5) was higher than in local jails with
500 to 999 inmates (4.4). </p>

<p> Expenditures </p>

<p> Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166
million during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, excluding
those at the Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only a
few months at the time of the census. Gross salaries and wages,
contributions to employee benefits, purchases of food, supplies,
contractual services, and other current operating costs accounted
for 76% of expenditures. Construction costs, major repairs,
equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capital
outlays made up the remaining 24%. </p>

<p> The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during the
year ending June 30, 1993, exclusive of capital expenditures was
$22,773, as compared to $14,667 among local jails. </p>

<p> Factors behind the growing jail population </p>

<p> An increasing number of arrests </p>

<p> Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jail
population after 1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from
11.7 million in 1983 to 14.0 million in 1993. Over the 10-year
period, the total number of arrests grew at an annual rate of
1.8%. For some offenses the annual rate of growth was
substantially greater: simple assault (7.6%), aggravated assault
(5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations
(3.9%). </p>

<p> The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number of
admissions to local jails. On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800
persons were officially booked and admitted to local jails, and
an additional 9,500 inmates were transferred in from other
facilities or readmitted after having been temporarily released.
The estimated number of new admissions totaled nearly 9.8 million
for 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the annual period
ending June 30, 1983. </p>

<p> Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of being
held in a local jail prior to the disposition of their case
remained nearly the same between 1988 and 1992. Based on the
biennial National Pretrial Reporting Program (NPRP) that
describes State felony defendants in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaiting
disposition in 1992. Roughly the same percentage was detained in
1988 (34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of Felony
Defendants, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990
[November 1992, NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994,
NCJ-148818]). </p>

<p> More felons sentenced to local jail </p>

<p> The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compounded
by a growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.
Between 1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced to
confinement in local jails almost doubled: </p>

<p> 1986-92 90% </p>

<p> Source: Felony Sentences in State Courts (1986, 1988, 1990,
and 1992). </p>

<p> Jail inmates received about the same average sentences Growth
in the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not the
result of longer sentences. Results from the National Judicial
Reporting Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992,
years in which comparable data on felons sentenced to local jails
are available, the average (mean) maximum jail sentence among
those entering jail remained constant. In 1988 and 1992 felons
sentenced to local jail received a mean sentence of 7 months.
(Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins, 1988 [December
1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077], and 1992
[January 1995, NCJ-151167]). </p>

<p> Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jails
also reveal no significant changes in the sentence lengths
received by sentenced inmates overall, including felons and
misdemeanants. About 50% of the jail inmates had been convicted
and sentenced at the time of both surveys. (Profile of Jail
Inmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991, NCJ-129097]).
Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the mean sentence
(from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the median. In
both years half of the sentenced inmates had received a sentence
of 6 months or less. </p>

<p> More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails </p>

<p> The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails was
drug law violators. Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and
1989, the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drug
offenses rose from 20,800 to 91,000. In 1983 about 1 of every 10
inmates were in jail for a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 of
every 4 were in jail for drugs. From 1983 to 1989 the increase in
the number of persons in jail for drug offenses accounted for
more than 40 percent of the total increase in the jail
population. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmates
decreased for violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and property
offenses (from 38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-order
offenses (from 20.6% to 22.8%). During this period, the total
number of inmates increased in every category: violent offenders
increased from 68,600 to 89,000; property offenders from 86,300
to 118,700; and public-order offenders from 46,100 to 90,200. </p>

<p> Although offense information for more recent years is not
available, estimates may be made using 1989 percentages. Assuming
no change in the percentage distributions, the estimated number
of drug offenders in local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800,
representing a 5-fold increase since 1983. </p>

<p> More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities </p>

<p> The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993
as a result of crowding in State and Federal prisons. On June 30,
1993, nearly 12% of all jail inmates were prisoners being held
for State or Federal authorities. An estimated 53,900 inmates
were held for State or Federal authorities in 1993, up from
17,281 in 1983. </p>

<p> Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for State
and Federal authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmate
population overall (212% compared with 106%). </p>

<p> Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in local
facilities as a direct result of crowding of State or Federal
facilities (representing 7.4% of all jail inmates). The other
19,700 inmates held for State or Federal authorities were in jail
for other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early release
(pending completion of paperwork or transportation),
participation in special programs, and special security needs. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Census of Jails </p>

<p> The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of data
collection efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locally
administered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988. As in previous censuses, the U.S.
Bureau of the Census collected the data for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. </p>

<p> The 1993 census included all locally administered confinement
facilities (3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are
staffed by municipal or county employees. The census also
included 17 jails that were privately operated under contract for
local governments and 7 facilities maintained by BOP and
functioning as jails. </p>

<p> Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,
such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours of
arrest). Also excluded were State-operated facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which
have combined jail-prison systems. Five locally operated jails in
Alaska were included. </p>

<p> The mailing list used for the census was derived from the
National Justice Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureau
of the Census for BJS. The census forms were mailed to 3,506
facilities on June 22, 1993. </p>

<p> Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and
230 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities. </p>

<p> After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requests
and repeated telephone contacts, all jails (except those in one
jurisdiction) provided data for four critical data items--number
of inmates, average daily population, rated capacity, and sex of
inmates housed. Data on the these four items for the
nonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the
1994 Annual Survey of Jails. </p>

<p> Completed forms with data for all or most items were received
for 2,981 jails, resulting in a 90% response rate. These
reporting jails housed 93% of all local jail inmates on June 30,
1993. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on all
census items except the four critical items, national totals had
to be estimated. The following procedures were used to estimate
totals when data were incomplete: </p>

<p> 1. Each item was first assessed for coverage and internal
consistency. For purposes of estimating the totals, extreme
values were examined and then verified by checking other census
information or calling the respondents. Detailed categories were
also checked to determine if they summed to the reported totals. </p>

<p> 2. To provide a national total, item values were summed and
then multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). For
most estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number of
inmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails that
reported valid data. Ratios based on inmate counts were used to
estimate the number of adults, the number of inmates by sex and
age, conviction status by sex, the number of staff by
occupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payroll
staff by sex and race. Ratios based on the total average daily
population were used to estimate total expenditures. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so
        that for each item the sum of the detail equaled the
        estimated total. For example, the estimated numbers of
        male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted so that
        the final estimates summed to the total number of adult
        inmates. </li>
    <li>All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the
        nearest 100. Expenditures were rounded to the nearest
        million dollars. </li>
</ol>

<p> 5. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in this
report are based on reported data only. </p>

<p> Annual Survey of Jails </p>

<p> In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 1994 Annual
Survey of Jails is the 10th such survey in a series begun in
1982. The reference date for the 1994 survey was June 30, 1994. </p>

<p> Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sample
of jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey. A
jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails. The sample
included all jails in 796 selected jail jurisdictions and 23
multijurisdiction jails. A multi-jurisdiction jail is one in
which two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement to
operate the facility. </p>

<p> In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were first
stratified into two groups: single jurisdiction jails and
multijurisdiction jails. All of the multi-jurisdiction jails were
included in the survey. The remaining jurisdictions were then
further stratified into two groups: jurisdictions with jails
authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holding
only adults. Jurisdictions were then selected based on the
average daily population in the 1993 census. All jails in 203
jurisdictions were automatically included if the jurisdiction
held juveniles and had an average daily population of 250 or more
inmates in 1993 or if they held only adults and had an average
population of 500 or more. The other jurisdictions (593) were
then selected based on stratified probability sampling. </p>

<p> Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. After follow-up
phone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey
was 100%. </p>

<p> National estimates for the inmate population on June 30,
1994, were produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age group
and for the average daily population during the year ending June
30, 1994. National estimates were also produced for rated
capacity. </p>

<p> Sampling error </p>

<p> Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because
jurisdictions with smaller average daily populations were sampled
for the survey. Estimates based on the sample survey may differ
somewhat from the results of conducting a complete census.
Different samples could yield somewhat different results.
Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates
from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an
estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of all
possible samples. The estimated relative sampling error for the
total inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%.
(See appendix tables 1 and 2.) </p>

<p> Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine
whether differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 survey
estimates were statistically significant. All differences
mentioned in the report meet or exceed the 95-percent confidence
level. </p>

<p> Measures of population </p>

<p> Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily
population for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on
June 30 of each year. The average daily population balances out
any extraordinary events that may render atypical the inmate
count on June 30. The June 30 count provides data on
characteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin, and
age, that may not be available on an annual basis. </p>

<p> Juveniles </p>

<p> State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances.
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect. The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new and more
accurate estimates of the juvenile population. For the first
time, the survey provides estimates of the total number of jail
inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the number
held as juveniles. New sampling procedures were also introduced
in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these estimates. By
stratifying jurisdictions based on the authority to house
juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were improved. </p>

<p> This study examines how State and Federal correctional
facilities seek to </p>

<p> stop the entry and use of illegal drugs. Based on the 1990
Census of State </p>

<p> and Federal Correctional Facilities, the report indicates
that nearly 9 in </p>

<p> 10 institutions conduct urine surveillance among the inmate
population, </p>

<p> usually on a random basis or on suspicion of use. Marijuana
and cocaine </p>

<p> were the drugs most commonly detected--in Federal facilities
about 1 in 100 </p>

<p> of the tests for marijuana and 1 in 250 tests for cocaine
were positive </p>

<p> while in State facilities about 1 in 16 tests were positive
for marijuana </p>

<p> and 1 in 28 were positive for cocaine. </p>

<p> I want to express my deep appreciation to the employees in
the 957 State </p>

<p> prisons, 80 Federal prisons, and the 250 community-based
facilities who </p>

<p> participated in the census. The 100-percent response rate is,
I believe, </p>

<p> important testimony to the utility and significance of
national data on the </p>

<p> operations of our Nation's correctional facilities. </p>

<p> By Caroline Wolf Harlow, Ph.D. </p>

<p> BJS Statistician </p>

<p> About 7 of every 8 prisons in the Nation tested an estimated
total of </p>

<p> 565,500 inmates for one or more illegal drugs between July 1,
1989, and </p>

<p> June 30, 1990. In State facilities, 3.6% of the tests for
cocaine, 1.3% </p>

<p> for heroin, 2.0% for methamphetamines, and 6.3% for marijuana
found </p>

<p> evidence of drug use. In Federal prisons, 0.4% of the tests
for cocaine, </p>

<p> 0.4% for heroin, 0.1% for methamphetamines, and 1.1% for
marijuana were </p>

<p> positive. </p>

<p> This report uses information provided to the Census of State
and Federal </p>

<p> Adult Correctional Facilities. Data were collected from 957
State prison </p>

<p> facilities, 250 State community-based facilities, and 80
Federal prisons </p>

<p> operating on June 29, 1990. Censuses were also conducted in
1984, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1974, but the 1990 census was the first to gather
information on drug </p>

<p> interdiction practices, drug testing of inmates and staff,
and inmate drug </p>

<p> treatment programs. </p>

<p> Other findings from the 1990 census include the following: </p>

<p> *Ninety-eight percent of State community-based
facilities--those in which </p>

<p> at least half of the residents may leave the facility
daily--tested </p>

<p> residents. All Federal prisons and 83% of State prisons
reported that they </p>

<p> tested inmates for drug use. </p>

<p> *Seventy-six percent of institutions reported testing inmates
for drugs </p>

<p> when drug use was suspected. Twenty percent tested all
inmates at least </p>

<p> once during confinement. </p>

<p> *At State confinement facilities 1.4% of tests for cocaine,
1.0% for </p>

<p> heroin, 2.3% for methamphetamines, and 5.8% for marijuana
indicated drug </p>

<p> use. </p>

<p> *At State community-based facilities 8.9% of tests for
cocaine confirmed </p>

<p> the presence of the drug, as did 2.2% for heroin, 1.1% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 8.1% for marijuana. </p>

<p> *State confinement facilities that only tested inmates
suspected of drug </p>

<p> use had higher positive rates than facilities that tested all
or random </p>

<p> groups of inmates (6% for cocaine and 14% for marijuana
versus 1.5% for </p>

<p> cocaine and 5% for marijuana). </p>

<p> *State and Federal facilities used a variety of methods to
prevent drugs </p>

<p> from being brought into the institution, including
ques-tioning, patdowns, </p>

<p> clothing exchanges, and body cavity searches. </p>

<p> *At admission inmates were required to exchange clothing in
88% of the </p>

<p> Federal prisons and 59% of State prisons; inmates were patted
down in 88% </p>

<p> of Federal prisons and 78% of the State prisons. </p>

<p> *In the facilities using the most intrusive interdiction
technique, body </p>

<p> cavity searches, positive drug test results among inmates
tested were lower </p>

<p> than in facilities using other methods of interdiction. </p>

<p> *Questioning and search of belongings were widely used for
visitors to both </p>

<p> Federal and State facilities. </p>

<p> *Federal confinement facilities reported that they could
provide drug </p>

<p> treatment for an estimated 7,800 inmates; State confinement
facilities, for </p>

<p> 114,000; and State community-based facilities, for 9,400. </p>

<p> *Federal facilities were using an estimated 62% of total drug
treatment </p>

<p> capacity on June 29, 1990; State confinement facilities, 78%;
and </p>

<p> community-based facilities, 66%. </p>

<p> Introduction </p>

<p> The Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities, conducted </p>

<p> periodically by the Bureau of the Census on behalf of the
Bureau of Justice </p>

<p> Statistics (BJS), included a new series of questions in 1990.
(See </p>

<p> Methodology on page 12 for further information about the
census and the </p>

<p> questionnaire.) This addendum--designed with the assistance
of the </p>

<p> National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Office of National
Drug Control </p>

<p> Policy--asked how facilities interdict drugs and
paraphernalia among </p>

<p> inmates, visitors, and staff and who was chosen for each
method of </p>

<p> interdiction. </p>

<p> In addition, the addendum gathered information on drug
testing policies, </p>

<p> practices, and outcomes. The questionnaire asked facilities
to estimate </p>

<p> the number of inmates in need of drug treatment programs and
the capacity </p>

<p> of currently available programs. </p>

<p> Methods of drug interdiction </p>

<p> Different facilities have a variety of policies and practices
related to </p>

<p> interdiction of drugs from inmates, visitors, and staff. </p>

<p> Facilities may physically check persons entering the
facility. Inmates may </p>

<p> be checked for drugs or other contraband when they enter a
facility for the </p>

<p> first time or reenter after an absence. The checks may be
relatively </p>

<p> nonintrusive, such as verbal questioning or pat-downs, or
more intrusive, </p>

<p> such as body cavity searches and clothing exchanges or
searches of </p>

<p> belongings. These checks may be conducted among all entering
persons, </p>

<p> random groups, or only those suspected of carrying drugs.
Many prisons may </p>

<p> use all of the approaches at different times. </p>

<p> The figure below shows a general typology for the range of
methods for each </p>

<p> type of drug interdiction. A plus sign (+) indicates the use
of a method </p>

<p> and a minus sign (-) means no reported use. Type 1
facilities, for </p>

<p> example, reported using all three methods to choose persons
for an </p>

<p> interdiction activity. Type 4 facilities reported performing
an </p>

<p> interdiction activity on all persons but not choosing random
or suspected </p>

<p> subjects. </p>

<p> Type 6 - + - </p>

<p> Type 7 - - + </p>

<p> Type 8 - - - </p>

<p> Interdiction activities: </p>

<p> Most prison facilities patted down inmates and required them
to exchange </p>

<p> clothes upon admission or any reentry </p>

<p> Prison facilities perform many activities to prevent drugs
and other </p>

<p> contraband from entering. Correctional authorities commonly
question </p>

<p> inmates, pat them down, require changing into
prison-furnished clothes, and </p>

<p> search body cavities. Eighty-eight percent of Federal
facilities reported </p>

<p> that they patted down new admissions and required them to
replace their </p>

<p> clothes (table 1). Seventy-eight percent of State confinement
facilities </p>

<p> and 71% of community-based facilities patted down newly
admitted inmates. </p>

<p> (Community-based facilities are those in which half or more
of the </p>

<p> residents are permitted to leave unaccompanied by staff for
work or study. </p>

<p> Because inmates regularly leave community-based facilities,
drug-related </p>

<p> problems in these facilities are different from those in
secured </p>

<p> facilities.) </p>

<p> Fifty-nine percent of State confinement facilities and 26% of
community- </p>

<p> based facilities required them to substitute prison clothes.
At least </p>

<p> three-quarters of both State and Federal facilities
questioned new </p>

<p> admissions about drugs. </p>

<p> When looking for the presence of hidden drugs, facilities
were less likely </p>

<p> to perform body cavity searches than take other interdiction
measures. </p>

<p> Sixty-one percent of Federal facilities, 45% of State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, and 14% of State community-based facilities
reported that they </p>

<p> conducted body cavity searches among inmates at admission. </p>

<p> Institutions could apply an interdiction activity to all
inmates, to groups </p>

<p> of inmates selected at random, or to suspected drug users or
couriers. </p>

<p> Patting down new and returning inmates and requiring them to
exchange </p>

<p> clothes generally applied to all inmates (table 2). Over 80%
of Federal </p>

<p> facilities patted down all inmates and required an exchange
of clothing. </p>

<p> Almost 78% of State confinement facilities frisked all
inmates, and 57% </p>

<p> substituted prison clothes. </p>

<p> In 46% of Federal facilities and in 20% of State facilities,
body cavity </p>

<p> searches were conducted among all entering inmates. About 39%
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities reported that a body cavity search
would be </p>

<p> conducted when the staff suspected inmates of carrying drugs.
</p>

<p> Most facilities searched the belongings </p>

<p> of visitors </p>

<p> Staff checked visitors' belongings for drugs in 93% of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions, 87% of State confinement facilities, and 76% of
the </p>

<p> community-based (table 3). Visitors were patted down for
drugs in 51% of </p>

<p> Federal prisons, 69% of State confinement institutions, and
40% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities. </p>

<p> All visitors were generally subjected to searches of their
belongings </p>

<p> (table 4). About 83% of Federal facilities and 57% of State
facilities </p>

<p> looked through the personal possessions of all visitors.
Frisking visitors </p>

<p> for drugs and checking body cavities occurred primarily if
visitors were </p>

<p> suspected of carrying drugs or paraphernalia. Five in ten of
Federal </p>

<p> prisons and 4 in 10 of State facilities patted down visitors
on suspicion. </p>

<p> About 28% of Federal Facilities and 18% of State facilities
searched body </p>

<p> cavities of visitors if the visitors were suspected of
smuggling drugs. </p>

<p> Staff were also subject to drug interdiction activities: </p>

<p> When reporting to work, staff were patted down in about half
of State </p>

<p> confinement facilities and in more than a fifth of Federal
confinement and </p>

<p> State community-based facilities (table 5). In over 50% of
Federal </p>

<p> facilities and 40% of State facilities staff were questioned.
Most </p>

<p> interdiction activities involving staff were conducted on
suspicion of </p>

<p> smuggling drugs. About 45% of Federal facilities and 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities interrogated staff if they were suspected of drug
involvement </p>

<p> (table 6). About 19% of Federal facilities also patted down
staff on </p>

<p> suspicion, compared to 14% of State facilities. About 23% of
State </p>

<p> facilities frisked staff members at random. </p>

<p> Maximum security facilities took more stringent drug
interdiction measures </p>

<p> than other facilities </p>

<p> Staff in Federal maximum security prisons were more likely
than those in </p>

<p> medium or minimum security facilities to search body cavities
and to </p>

<p> require all inmates to exchange clothing (table 7). All
Federal maximum </p>

<p> security institutions required all inmates to put on new
prison-issued </p>

<p> clothes upon entry or reentry. Nearly 55% of Federal maximum
security </p>

<p> facilities, compared to 38% of minimum security prisons,
conducted body </p>

<p> cavity searches of all newly admitted or returning inmates. </p>

<p> In maximum security prisons staff were less likely than in
other Federal </p>

<p> facilities to question all of the inmates or to pat them
down. All inmates </p>

<p> were interrogated in 64% of maximum security prisons and
frisked in 73%, </p>

<p> while all inmates were questioned in 94% of minimum security
facilities and </p>

<p> patted down in 81%. </p>

<p> The staff in State maximum and medium security prisons were
more likely </p>

<p> than those in minimum security facilities to make all
entering or returning </p>

<p> inmates exchange clothes (over 60% of maximum or medium
security prisons, </p>

<p> compared to 47% of minimum security prisons). In nearly 1 in
5 maximum </p>

<p> security State prisons, staff searched the body cavities of
all new or </p>

<p> returning prisoners. Staff performed body cavity searches on
suspected </p>

<p> inmates in over half of State maximum security facilities. </p>

<p> State community-based facilities were less likely than State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities to search residents to interdict drugs. Staff in
about 59% of </p>

<p> State community-based facilities patted down all inmates. In
22% of </p>

<p> community-based facilities, the staff required all inmates to
change to </p>

<p> facility clothing, and in 15%, searched body cavities of
residents </p>

<p> suspected of having drugs. </p>

<p> Interpreting measures of drug testing </p>

<p> Prevalence of drug use in prisons is difficult to estimate.
Part of the </p>

<p> difficulty occurs with record keeping and reporting. A drug
test </p>

<p> determines the presence of a specific drug at a specific
level. A single </p>

<p> urine sample can be used for a single drug test or for
multiple tests for </p>

<p> different drugs. Correctional authorities were asked to
report the number </p>

<p> of tests for each drug and the number of positive tests.
However, some </p>

<p> authorities may have reported the number of urine samples
taken if their </p>

<p> records included only those figures. </p>

<p> Other difficulties in estimating the amount of drug use in
prison include </p>

<p> the following: </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in the selection of whom to test. Most
facilities do not </p>

<p> choose inmates for testing using a sample with a known
probability of </p>

<p> selection: One cannot say that the selected inmates represent
all inmates </p>

<p> in the institution. </p>

<p> * Prisons differ in what drugs they test for. Prison
authorities may not </p>

<p> suspect the use of a drug and not test for it, even though
the drug is used </p>

<p> in their facility. Other prisons may conduct repeated tests
for a drug </p>

<p> seldom used. </p>

<p> * A single urine specimen can have more than one positive
drug test from an </p>

<p> individual using multiple drugs. Describing positive rates by
type of drug </p>

<p> will overstate the number of inmates with at least one
positive test. </p>

<p> *Prisons differ in how often they test inmates. Drug testing
may be rare </p>

<p> in some prisons and frequent in others. </p>

<p> *Urine tests only detect the presence of most drugs 48 to 72
hours after </p>

<p> use, except for PCP and marijuana, which may be detected up
to 30 days </p>

<p> after use. </p>

<p> This varying span, when combined with lack of random
sampling, distorts any </p>

<p> estimation of overall drug use. </p>

<p> * Depending on various factors, the presence of
methamphetamines may not be </p>

<p> distinguished from amphetamines; therefore, the test results
for these two </p>

<p> drugs should be considered together. </p>

<p> *Prisons may differ in the types of tests used. Some types
are more </p>

<p> accurate than others, producing lower numbers of false
positives and false </p>

<p> negatives. Facilities may or may not perform confirmatory
tests, and they </p>

<p> were not asked to estimate the number of false positives and
false </p>

<p> negatives. </p>

<p> For the above reasons, drug test results in this report are
not a measure </p>

<p> of the extent of the problem in the various kinds of
facilities. Positive </p>

<p> results should be interpreted only as indicating the
percentage positive </p>

<p> for the specific tests given. </p>

<p> Testing urine for drug use </p>

<p> Most correctional facilities tested some inmates for illegal
drug use </p>

<p> About 87% of all correctional facilities tested inmates for
illegal drug </p>

<p> use (table 8). All Federal prisons, 83% of State confinement
facilities, </p>

<p> and 98% of State community-based facilities reported testing
inmates </p>

<p> between July 1, 1989, and June 30, 1990. </p>

<p> Authorities in facilities which reported data (85% of all
facilities) </p>

<p> indicated that they collected 598,000 urine specimens from
468,500 inmates. </p>

<p> When these figures are projected to all facilities, including
those which </p>

<p> did not respond to these questions, an estimated 565,500
inmates provided </p>

<p> 721,800 specimens from July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990.
(See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> State minimum and medium security and community-based
facilities were more </p>

<p> likely than maximum security institutions to test inmates.
About 85% of </p>

<p> the lower security facilities and 98% of community-based
facilities tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to 76% of the maximum security prisons. </p>

<p> Most State facilities testing inmates for drugs performed the
tests when </p>

<p> the staff suspected particular inmates of drug use; 76% of
the institutions </p>

<p> reported checking inmates based on suspicion of use.
Forty-two percent </p>

<p> tested both suspected inmates and random groups, and an
additional 14% </p>

<p> tested all inmates (type 1). Relatively few facilities (20%)
tested all </p>

<p> inmates at least once during confinement (types 1-4). </p>

<p> Most large State confinement facilities tested for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of State prisons with a population of 2,500 or more
tested </p>

<p> inmates, compared to around 83% of facilities with fewer than
1,000 inmates </p>

<p> and 77% of facilities with a population between 1,000 and
2,499 (table 9). </p>

<p> Over half of the largest facilities tested inmates on
suspicion only. Over </p>

<p> half of facilities with a population between 250 and 2,499
tested all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups of inmates in addition to inmates
suspected of </p>

<p> drug use. About 70% of community-based facilities tested
either all </p>

<p> inmates or random groups and inmates suspected of using
drugs. </p>

<p> Almost all work release facilities tested </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> About 92% of facilities that provided special work release or
prerelease </p>

<p> programs tested inmates for drugs (table 10). Ninety-three
percent of </p>

<p> facilities that separately handled offenders reincarcerated
for violating </p>

<p> some condition of their supervised release also checked
inmates for drugs. </p>

<p> Over 90% of facilities that performed &quot;other&quot;
functions, such as </p>

<p> presentence, psychiatric, or geriatric services also tested
their </p>

<p> residents. Nearly 60% of facilities for youthful offenders
tested inmates. </p>

<p> For all inmates tested, State prisons reported higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> Federal prisons </p>

<p> Nationwide, 3.1% of the tests for cocaine in the 12 months
before June 30, </p>

<p> 1990, were positive, as were 1.2% of the tests for heroin,
1.5% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, and 5.6% for marijuana. State facilities
reported higher </p>

<p> positive rates for drug tests than Federal facilities (table
11). In State </p>

<p> institutions, 3.6% of tests for cocaine were positive,
compared to 0.4% in </p>

<p> Federal prisons. State facilities found 2.0% of the tests
showing recent </p>

<p> methamphetamine use and 6.3% showing marijuana use; Federal
prisons found </p>

<p> 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. </p>

<p> I </p>

<p> Same percentage of State and Federal facilities reported
positive drug </p>

<p> tests </p>

<p> When facilities rather than individual drug tests are
considered, Federal </p>

<p> and State facilities were about equally likely to have found
drug use in </p>

<p> their institutions. Around 6 in 10 of both Federal and State
facilities </p>

<p> which tested for cocaine had at least one positive test. In
over 2 in 10 </p>

<p> facilities testing for methamphetamines, the use of the drug
was </p>

<p> discovered. Marijuana was detected in about 8 in 10
facilities testing. </p>

<p> Community-based facilities found higher rates of drug use
than confinement </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> Tests had positive outcomes for 8.9% of the cocaine tests and
8.1% of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests administered by community-based facilities,
compared to </p>

<p> 1.4% of the cocaine tests and 5.8% of marijuana tests in
confinement </p>

<p> facilities (table 12). Methamphetamines, however, were found
more often in </p>

<p> confinement facilities (2.3% tested positive) than in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities (1.1% positive). </p>

<p> Among State confinement facilities, positive test results
were highest in </p>

<p> those testing on suspicion only. </p>

<p> How inmates were selected for testing affected the rate of
positive </p>

<p> results. Those State confinement facilities testing only when
drug use was </p>

<p> suspected recorded higher rates of positive results than
other facilities </p>

<p> that tested randomly or comprehensively. When facilities
tested only on </p>

<p> suspicion of drug use, 6% of cocaine tests and 14% of
marijuana tests were </p>

<p> positive, compared to 1.5% or less for cocaine and 5% or less
for marijuana </p>

<p> when facilities tested everyone or at random. </p>

<p> The results for State community-based facilities were
opposite those of </p>

<p> confinement facilities. Testing on suspicion only produced a
lower </p>

<p> percentage of positive results than testing everyone or a
random selection. </p>

<p> In community-based facilities which tested on suspicion only,
4.8% were </p>

<p> positive for cocaine and 6.4% for marijuana; in
community-based facilities </p>

<p> using other selection methods, around 9% of tests for cocaine
and 8% for </p>

<p> marijuana were positive. </p>

<p> The percentages of positive tests were higher in large
facilities </p>

<p> Large prisons, whether Federal or State, had higher rates of
positive drug </p>

<p> tests. In Federal facilities with 1,000 or more inmates, 1.4%
of the </p>

<p> marijuana tests, 0.6% of the cocaine, and 0.6% of the heroin
tests were </p>

<p> positive (table 13). In Federal facilities holding fewer than
500 inmates, </p>

<p> the percentages were 0.5% for marijuana, 0.2% for cocaine,
and none for </p>

<p> heroin. Among State prisons, the largest facilities with
2,500 or more </p>

<p> inmates had the highest percentages of positive tests for
amphetamines, </p>

<p> cocaine, and heroin. </p>

<p> The facilities holding 1,000 to 2,499 inmates had the highest
rates for </p>

<p> marijuana and methamphetamines. Among Federal prisons, the
maximum </p>

<p> security facilities had higher rates for positive drug tests
than minimum </p>

<p> security facilities. In maximum security prisons, 2.5% of the
tests for </p>

<p> marijuana, .7% of the tests for cocaine, and 1.4% of the
tests for heroin </p>

<p> were positive. In minimum security, 0.3% for marijuana, 0.3%
for cocaine, </p>

<p> and none for heroin were positive. </p>

<p> State medium security facilities generally had higher
positive rates than </p>

<p> maximum or minimum security prisons. For each drug in medium
security </p>

<p> facilities, the percentage positive was as follows: 6.8% for
marijuana, </p>

<p> 4.2% for methamphetamines, 1.7% for cocaine, and 1.4% for
heroin. In </p>

<p> maximum and minimum facilities, the equivalent findings were
5.0% or less </p>

<p> for marijuana, 0.6% or less for methamphetamines, 1.4% or
less for cocaine, </p>

<p> and 0.8% or less for heroin. </p>

<p> Positive results from drug tests varied among facilities
performing </p>

<p> different functions </p>

<p> Facilities which confined inmates returned to custody for
parole violations </p>

<p> had relatively high percentages of positive drug tests (table
14). More </p>

<p> than 9% of tests for marijuana were positive, as were 6.2% of
tests for </p>

<p> methamphetamines, 3.5% for cocaine, and 2.9% for heroin.
Facilities </p>

<p> holding inmates who participated in work release programs or
who were </p>

<p> preparing for discharge also had relatively high positive
test rates: 7% </p>

<p> for cocaine, 6.9% for marijuana, and 1.8% for heroin. Drug/
alcohol </p>

<p> treatment in facilities was associated with relatively high
positive </p>

<p> results on tests for cocaine and marijuana use--3% for
cocaine and 7.6% for </p>

<p> marijuana. </p>

<p> Facilities handling youthful offenders generally had
relatively low </p>

<p> positive test results: 2.1% for marijuana and 1.5% for
cocaine. </p>

<p> Positive drug tests were linked to interdiction activities </p>

<p> The State confinement facilities that questioned and frisked
inmates but </p>

<p> did not exchange clothes or search body cavities had higher
rates of </p>

<p> positive drug tests than facilities doing all these measures
(table 15). </p>

<p> The tests in the facilities using less stringent measures
were 5.2% </p>

<p> positive for cocaine, 13.5% for marijuana, and 16.2% for
methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Tests in facilities performing all types of specific drug
interdiction </p>

<p> activities were 1.2% positive for cocaine, 4.6% for
marijuana, and 0.6% for </p>

<p> methamphetamines. Facilities which performed all types of
interdiction </p>

<p> activities had higher positive drug test rates than
facilities which did </p>

<p> body cavity searches and/or clothing exchanges. The
facilities doing all </p>

<p> types of interdiction may have adopted more measures as a
reaction to </p>

<p> relatively high test rates. The reported rates were from
results over the </p>

<p> 12 months before the census, while the interdiction measures
were those in </p>

<p> place on June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> Facilities that did not question, frisk, or search visitors
had the </p>

<p> following positive test results: 8.3% for marijuana and 7.4%
for cocaine. </p>

<p> Facilities that inspected visitors' belongings and searched
body cavities </p>

<p> when indicated, but did not both question and pat down
visitors, had the </p>

<p> following positive test percentages: 2.9% for heroin, 2.6%
for cocaine, and </p>

<p> 12% for methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Facilities that reported not making special efforts to
interdict the supply </p>

<p> of drugs from the staff had 2.6% positive tests for cocaine,
2.2% for </p>

<p> heroin, and 6.6% for methamphetamines. Facilities that
questioned staff, </p>

<p> patted them down, and took other actions such as drug
testing, when needed </p>

<p> had 1.0% positive tests for cocaine and 0.9% for heroin and </p>

<p> methamphetamines. </p>

<p> Drug testing of staff was highest </p>

<p> in Federal facilities </p>

<p> While 83% of Federal facilities reported they tested their
staff for drugs, </p>

<p> 42% of State confinement facilities and 32% of
community-based facilities </p>

<p> checked their employees (table 16). About 55% of Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities tested all staff, as did 30% of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 19% of community-based facilities. </p>

<p> Seventy-six percent of Federal facilities and about 23% of
State facilities </p>

<p> tested employees, the primary staff category tested. </p>

<p> A higher percentage of Federal than State facility staff were
tested for </p>

<p> drugs. Fifteen percent of Federal facility staff were tested
compared to </p>

<p> 4% of those working in State confinement facilities and 10%
in community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> A positive test was grounds for dismissal </p>

<p> in over a third of facilities that tested staff </p>

<p> for drugs </p>

<p> In over a third of facilities, policies required that staff
testing </p>

<p> positive for drugs be dismissed. In over a seventh, affected
staff were </p>

<p> suspended (table 17). Sixty percent of State confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 44% of community-based facilities referred positive drug
detection cases to </p>

<p> internal affairs. Fifty-nine percent of Federal facilities
referred the </p>

<p> case to a departmentally operated program -- generally an
employee </p>

<p> assistance counselor who could refer the employee for outside
treatment. </p>

<p> Federal facilities were more likely than State facilities to
keep their </p>

<p> staff and continue to check them for drugs or to reassign
them. Twenty- </p>

<p> four percent of Federal facilities continued monitoring staff
with drug </p>

<p> tests, compared to 10% of State confinement facilities and
12%of community- </p>

<p> based facilities. </p>

<p> Inmate/resident drug treatment programs and capacities </p>

<p> Facilities provided estimates of the number of
inmates/residents who could </p>

<p> be treated in each of their drug treatment and intervention
programs and </p>

<p> estimates of the enrollment in each program. Facilities also
estimated </p>

<p> their total capacity for drug treatment and their total
enrollment. These </p>

<p> totals were generally lower than the sum of all the
separately listed </p>

<p> programs and interventions, possibly for the following
reasons: </p>

<p> *some programs listed were not considered true drug
&quot;treatment&quot; programs; </p>

<p> *an individual program might have several of the components
listed on the </p>

<p> addendum--for example, counseling, education, and urine
surveillance--and </p>

<p> hence be counted several times in the specific listings; </p>

<p> *inmates could be participating in more than one program; </p>

<p> *facilities could have some treatment slots which could be
allocated to </p>

<p> more than one program and therefore were counted more than
once. </p>

<p> Drug treatment/intervention on June 29, 1990 </p>

<p> Among the 1,287 State and Federal facilities, 1,024 reported
their own </p>

<p> estimates of total capacity and enrollment in programs they
considered to </p>

<p> be for drug treatment. Facility capacities and enrollments
for drug </p>

<p> treatment were-- </p>

<p> Among those Federal facilities that reported, administrators
indicated that </p>

<p> on a single day the facilities could treat about 6,100
inmates and had an </p>

<p> enrollment of about 3,800. For reporting State facilities,
both </p>

<p> confinement and community-based, the estimated capacity was
90,900 and </p>

<p> enrollment was 69,900. </p>

<p> Prisons could treat an estimated </p>

<p> 131,900 inmates for drug addiction </p>

<p> If the reported capacity is projected to all prisons, Federal
confinement </p>

<p> facilities could treat an estimated 7,800 inmates; State
confinement </p>

<p> facilities, 114,000; and State community-based facilities,
9,400. (See </p>

<p> &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Federal confinement facilities had the capacity to treat for
drug abuse 14% </p>

<p> of the inmate population; State confinement facilities, 18%;
and community- </p>

<p> based facilities, 55%. </p>

<p> Prisons were treating approximately 100,200 inmates </p>

<p> If the reported enrollment figures are projected to cover all
facilities, </p>

<p> the Federal prison system was treating an estimated 4,800
inmates; the </p>

<p> State prisons, an estimated 88,700; and community-based
facilities, an </p>

<p> estimated 6,200. (See &quot;Estimation procedure&quot; in
Methodology.) </p>

<p> (Treatment capacity and enrollment were estimated from the
77.7% of Federal </p>

<p> inmates in reporting facilities, 72.9% of State inmates in
reporting </p>

<p> confinement facilities, and 83.3% of State inmates in
reporting community- </p>

<p> based facilities.) </p>

<p> Enrollment in drug treatment was below capacity) </p>

<p> Federal inmates were using 62% of the drug treatment capacity
on June 29, </p>

<p> 1990. State prisoners were using 66% of the capacity in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities and 78% in confinement facilities. </p>

<p> Many factors play a role in these utilization figures.
Inmates may refuse </p>

<p> to participate or may have already completed the program.
Inmates may not </p>

<p> qualify--too new to the institution, not near enough to the
end of their </p>

<p> sentence, rule breakers, under administrative segregation, or
in the wrong </p>

<p> custody level. Facilities also may keep some slots open to
gain </p>

<p> flexibility to deal with unexpected situations. </p>

<p> Prisons offered a variety of programs </p>

<p> Prisons may offer many types of drug intervention or
treatment: </p>

<p> detoxification, counseling, education and/or awareness
programs, urine </p>

<p> surveillance, and treatment in special residential units
within the </p>

<p> facility. Federal facilities reported they could test 33% of
inmates for </p>

<p> drugs; State confinement facilities, 10%; and community-based
facilities, </p>

<p> 57% (table 18). Counseling was available for 14% of inmates
in Federal </p>

<p> facilities, 12% in State confinement facilities, and 48% in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. Residential treatment program capacity was from
1% to 2% of </p>

<p> inmate population for all types </p>

<p> of institutions. </p>

<p> Of all Federal inmates, 9% were enrolled in some form of drug
treatment on </p>

<p> June 29, 1990. Among State prisoners, 14% in confinement
facilities and </p>

<p> 37% in community-based facilities were enrolled. The two most
common types </p>

<p> of programs for both Federal and State correctional
facilities were </p>

<p> education and counseling. </p>

<p> Drug education programs enrolled 13% of Federal prisoners, 7%
of State </p>

<p> confinement inmates, and 25% of residents in community-based
facilities. </p>

<p> Six percent of those in Federal facilities were being
counseled, as were 9% </p>

<p> of State confinement facility inmates and 32% of those in
community-based </p>

<p> facilities. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> The 1990 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities was the </p>

<p> fourth enumeration of State institutions and the first of
Federal </p>

<p> institutions sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and conducted by </p>

<p> the Bureau of the Census. Earlier censuses were completed in
1974, 1979, </p>

<p> and 1984. </p>

<p> Census universe </p>

<p> The facility universe was developed from the Census of State
Adult </p>

<p> Correctional Facilities conducted in 1984. This list was
revised using the </p>

<p> 1990 American Correctional Association Directory and
information obtained </p>

<p> from State correctional administrators and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons. </p>

<p> The census included: prisons; prison farms; reception,
diagnostic and </p>

<p> classification centers; road camps; forestry and conservation
camps; </p>

<p> youthful offender facilities (except in California);
vocational training </p>

<p> facilities; correctional drug and alcohol treatment
facilities; and State- </p>

<p> operated local detention facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, </p>

<p> Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p>

<p> Facilities were included in the census if they: </p>

<p> *were staffed with State or Federal employees </p>

<p> *housed primarily State or Federal prisoners </p>

<p> *were physically, functionally, and administratively separate
from other </p>

<p> facilities </p>

<p> *were operational on the reference date, June 29, 1990. </p>

<p> The census also included, for the first time, 67 private
facilities that </p>

<p> were under exclusive contract by State governments to house
prisoners. </p>

<p> Specifically excluded were-- </p>

<p> *privately operated facilities that were not exclusively for
State or </p>

<p> Federal inmates </p>

<p> *military facilities </p>

<p> *Immigration and Naturalization Service facilities </p>

<p> *facilities operated and administered by local governments,
including those </p>

<p> housing State prisoners </p>

<p> *facilities operated by the U.S. Marshals Service </p>

<p> *hospital wings and wards reserved </p>

<p> for State prisoners. </p>

<p> Questionnaire administration </p>

<p> Questionnaires were mailed to facility respondents at the end
of June 1990. </p>

<p> Second and third request forms and telephone followups went
out in the </p>

<p> fall, resulting in a final response rate of 100%. </p>

<p> Definitions of community-based and confinement facilities </p>

<p> Correctional facilities were classified as community-based if
50% or more </p>

<p> of the residents were regularly permitted to leave the
facility </p>

<p> unaccompanied for work or study. These facilities included
halfway houses, </p>

<p> restitution centers, and pre-release, work release, and study
release </p>

<p> centers. Correctional facilities in which less than 50% of
the inmates </p>

<p> regularly left the facility unaccompanied were classified as
confinement </p>

<p> institutions. </p>

<p> Drug addendum </p>

<p> An addendum on drug control activities in State and Federal
facilities was </p>

<p> included for the first time in the 1990 census. Facilities
were asked to </p>

<p> provide information on the following: </p>

<p> *activities they used with inmates, visitors, and staff to
keep out illegal </p>

<p> drugs and drug paraphernalia </p>

<p> *inmate drug testing practices, including the criteria for
testing inmates, </p>

<p> the number of inmates tested in total and by specific drug,
and the number </p>

<p> positive </p>

<p> *staff drug testing, including groups and basis for testing,
number tested, </p>

<p> and procedures when tests were positive </p>

<p> *capacity and enrollment in various types of drug treatment
and </p>

<p> intervention programs. </p>

<p> Estimation procedures </p>

<p> When all prisons in the census did not provide data on
particular </p>

<p> variables, estimated figures were used where indicated. Total
figures were </p>

<p> estimated by multiplying the known or reported numbers by the
ratio of the </p>

<p> total relevant population to the reported population. All
figures were </p>

<p> estimated independently and total estimates were therefore
larger than the </p>

<p> sum of all subgroup estimates. The total population figure
used in the </p>

<p> projections varied, depending upon which figure was most
appropriate. The </p>

<p> two available population figures are the average daily
population and the </p>

<p> prison count on the reference day for the census, June 29,
1990. For drug </p>

<p> testing, table 8, the basis for estimation was the average
daily </p>

<p> population, and for drug treatment capacity and enrollment,
the basis was </p>

<p> the 1-day count. </p>

<p> Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results
were not subject </p>

<p> to sampling error. </p>

<p> Public use data tapes for each Census of Adult Correctional
Facilities in </p>

<p> the series, conducted in 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1990, are

<h2>Correctional Populations in the United States 1980 - 1993 </h2>

<p> <b>Bureau of Justice Statistics Executive Summary</b> </p>

<p> <b>U.S. Department of Justice</b> </p>

<p> <b>Office of Justice Programs</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> The Nation's correctional population jumped more than 2 1/2
times from 1980 through 1993. During 1993 approximately 2.6% of
the U.S. population--4.9 million adults--were on parole, on
probation, or in jails or prisons, an increase of 3 million
people since 1980. More than 909,000 men and women were in the
custody of State and Federal prisons, 455,500 were in local
jails, 671,000 on parole, and 2.8 million on probation: </p>

<p> --More than two-thirds of the 4.9 million persons under
correctional supervision were on probation or parole. </p>

<p> --The Nation's parole population had the fastest rate of
growth, 205% from 1980 to 1993. </p>

<p> --During the 13 years between 1980 and 1993, the probation
population grew by more than 1.7 million, larger than the
increase in any other correctional population. </p>

<p> --In 1993 nearly 1.4 million offenders were in local jail and
State or Federal prison. </p>

<p> During the 1980-92 period, the percent of black State and
Federal prisoners increased from 46.5% to 50% at a time when the
percentage of blacks in the general population increased from
11.8% to 12.4%. The Hispanic prison population doubled from 7.7%
to 14.1%, while Hispanics in the general population increased
from 6.5% to 9.5%. </p>

<p> At yearend 1992, there were 4,094 black male inmates per
100,000 black adults in the U.S. population, compared to 502
white male inmates per 100,000 adult white residents. Among U.S.
adults who neither graduated from high school nor earned a
general equivalence degree (GED), almost 6% of blacks and 1% of
whites were in a Federal or State prison serving a sentence of a
year or more. </p>

<p> The number of convicted drug offenders increased ninefold
(from 19,000 to 172,300) from 1980 through 1992. The number of
violent offenders accounted for a larger share of the growth in
the total prison population (41%, compared to 32% for drug
offenders). The total number of violent offenders in State prison
increased by nearly 200,000 during the 12-year period. </p>

<p> The number of returned parole violators and newly admitted
probation violators soared between 1980 and 1992. Almost 1 in
every 3 offenders admitted to State prisons (142,000) in 1992
were probation or parole violators, compared to 1 in every 6
(27,000) in 1980. </p>

<p> Violent offenders were more likely to be sent to prison in
1992 than they were in 1980. Relative to the number of victims of
murder, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault, the number of
violent offenders admitted to State prison increased during the
12-year period, from 18 admissions per 1,000 violent
victimizations to 27 per 1,000. </p>

<p> Between 1980 and 1992 the rate of incarceration in State and
Federal prisons more than doubled, from 139 sentenced inmates
(inmates serving 1 year or more) per 100,000 U.S. residents to
332 per 100,000. In 1992 incarceration rates were nearly 19 times
higher among adult men than among adult women (883 per 100,000
compared to 47) and 8 times higher among adult black men than
among adult white men. </p>

<p> The data are from a 188-page book published by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) and listing the correctional populations
of each State and the Federal system. The book lists jail and
prison suicide statistics, correctional crowding, electronic
monitoring, sentence commutations, jail AIDS deaths and much
more. Single copie&quot;s of the publication, &quot;Correctional
Populations in the United States, 1992, (NCJ-146413), written by
BJS statistician Tracy L. Snell, may be obtained from the BJS

<h2>What This Document Is </h2>

<p>In August, 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration held a
special conference to try to deal with the fact that they were
getting beaten -- badly -- every time they tried to come out for
a drug policy debate. In the last few years, they have been
beaten in these debates so often that it is really an
embarrasment to the whole drug warrior crew. They don't have a
single argument which stands up to close scrutiny. </p>

<p>The reason they were getting beaten is because people began
using the Persuasive Strategies and they got better educated on
the issue. As a result of the Persuasive Strategies being used by
large numbers of people across the US, they were getting publicly
hammered every time they came out for a debate. It was really an
embarrassing trend, so they had to try to do something about it. </p>

<p>Now they have laid out, in detail, their ten biggest arguments
on the issues raised in the debate. These arguments will now be
laid to rest. </p>

<p>Because their book was in large part a response to my
Persuasive Strategies, I have undertaken to write a reply to
their book. In short, they still don't have a single argument
which stands up to close scrutiny. The debate is over and it is
time for them to admit it. </p>

fits over the last few years. They were originally published on

Washington and flew in law enforcement people, politicians, and
public relations experts to try to figure out some way to deal
with the fact that they were getting hammered every time they
came out for a debate. These Persuasive Strategies were the
specific reason for that conference and their booklet <a
href="how2men.htm">How to Hold Your Own In a Drug Legalization
Debate</a> was a direct response to, and borrowed from, the
Persuasive Strategies. </p>

<p> remainder of the year, however, cocaine was readily available
as </p>

<p> kilogram prices in virtually all major metropolitan areas
returned to </p>

<p> lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993 indicate that
kilogram </p>

<p> prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992. However, by year's end, purity at all levels
had once </p>

<p> again increased. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> Regarding the use of cocaine, the National Household Survey
on Drug </p>

<p> Abuse for 1992 indicated that the number of past-year and
past-month </p>

<p> users of cocaine has decreased significantly since 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown a
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> cocaine use continued to decline among high school seniors
and 10th </p>

<p> graders. Among 8th graders, however, survey data indicated
increased use </p>

<p> of cocaine. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) shows
that the </p>

<p> estimated number of nationwide cocaine-related emergency room
episodes, </p>

<p> which had been increasing at a fairly constant rate from the
early-to- </p>

<p> late 1980s, declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990.
During the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes
increased once </p>

<p> again and appears to have stabilized at high levels since
that time. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the smoking of
cocaine continues </p>

<p> to be the predominant route of administration used by
patients admitted </p>

<p> to DAWN emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who indicated that smoking was their primary method
of </p>

<p> administration increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to
41.4 </p>

<p> percent in FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and females arrestees, as reported by the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF), remained high in many major U.S.
cities in </p>

<p> 1992. In fact, rates of cocaine use during the past year were
</p>

<p> substantially higher than those for opiate and marijuana use.
</p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or </p>

<p> through Mexico. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers, perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western
Caribbean, have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
</p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine trafficking organizations
continue to use </p>

<p> maritime vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vessels
to smuggle </p>

<p> cocaine from source countries into the United States.
Moreover, </p>

<p> traffickers utilize low-profile vessels designed to elude
radar </p>

<p> detection for smuggling cocaine into Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Several DEA field divisions report cocaine trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> have increased their use of airdrop operations. Cocaine
traffickers are </p>

<p> airdropping cocaine shipments in the Caribbean and off the
coast of, as </p>

<p> well as within, Central America and Southern Mexico.
Additionally, South </p>

<p> American cocaine traffickers have acquired several large
cargo aircraft, </p>

<p> thereby increasing cargo capacity while overcoming the
limited flight </p>

<p> range of smaller aircraft. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers have decreased the average
size of </p>

<p> cocaine shipments and shifted transportation routes to less
trafficked </p>

<p> ports of entry. For example, in response to an enhanced law
enforcement </p>

<p> presence in southern California, traffickers are increasingly
using U.S. </p>

<p> ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to transport
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine remain
Arizona, </p>

<p> southern California, south Florida, and Texas. The principal
cities </p>

<p> utilized by Colombian cartels for distributing bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York
City. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to </p>

<p> transport cocaine. Concealed compartments within vehicles are
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. Moreover, cocaine traffickers
using </p>

<p> tractor-trailers frequently secrete cocaine in hidden
compartments and </p>

<p> among legitimate produce. Extensive use of commercial trucks
to </p>

<p> transport cocaine from the Los Angeles metropolitan area to
destinations </p>

<p> throughout the United States occurred during the past year. </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City,
Philadelphia, </p>

<p> and San Francisco. The operators of these cells receive
orders directly </p>

<p> from top-level cartel managers in Colombia, and operate
independently of </p>

<p> other cells within the same metropolitan area. The operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, facsimile
machines, etc., </p>

<p> in their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often
bought in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and then discarded after being used for several
months or </p>

<p> less in order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept
efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups which comprise the Medellin Cartel employ
a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to a
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, Medellin-related trafficking groups are not as
restricted as </p>

<p> those associated with the Cali Cartel regarding the variety
of </p>

<p> distributors with whom they transact business. </p>

<p> Hispanic trafficking organizations, particularly Colombian
and Mexican, </p>

<p> continue to dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and
distribution </p>

<p> within the United States. A greater diversity, however, has
become </p>

<p> involved in these activities at all levels of the domestic
traffic since </p>

<p> early 1992. </p>

<p> During 1992, four cocaine conversion laboratories were seized
within the </p>

<p> United States, two in New York City, one in California, and
one in </p>

<p> Florida. To date in 1993, one cocaine base conversion
laboratory was </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Crack continues to be readily available in virtually every
major city </p>

<p> and, to a somewhat lesser extent, many small towns and rural
areas in </p>

<p> the United States. Crack manufacturing and distribution have
reached a </p>

<p> saturation point in the larger metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75, but generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. Gram prices range from
$45 to $150. </p>

<p> Ounce-quantities can be purchased for $475 to $2,500. When
available in </p>

<p> kilogram quantities, crack prices are comparable to those for
kilogram </p>

<p> quantities of cocaine hydrochloride, ranging from $17,000 to
$35,000. </p>

<p> Analysis of crack samples by DEA laboratories during the
mid-to-late </p>

<p> 1980's revealed that retail purity was consistently high,
averaging 80- </p>

<p> plus percent. Although current retail purity remains
approximately at </p>

<p> that level, sellers in some areas of the country are selling
poor- </p>

<p> quality crack. Adulterants are increasingly being added to
increase the </p>

<p> weight or size of the crack dosage unit. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year, and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. Survey data indicate that
314,000 </p>

<p> Americans used crack during the past month and over 805,000
used it </p>

<p> during the </p>

<p> past year. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among seniors declined from 1991 to
1992; however, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack by this group
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable during that period. Nevertheless, overall
frequency of </p>

<p> crack use among high school seniors has decreased
substantially since </p>

<p> 1987. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN indicates that smoking is the predominant
route of </p>

<p> cocaine administration used by patients admitted to DAWN
emergency rooms </p>

<p> for cocaine-related problems. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, </p>

<p> and Haitian and Dominican groups. </p>

<p> Saturated markets, low prices, violent competition, and
effective law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure in major urban areas have forced some
crack </p>

<p> trafficking organizations to develop new markets. These
organizations </p>

<p> are moving to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas across
the nation, </p>

<p> creating many problems for local law enforcement and civic
authorities. </p>

<p> The largest and more advanced organizations are crisscrossing
the nation </p>

<p> in this effort, with the Jamaican posses moving generally
westward and </p>

<p> the Crips and Bloods expanding eastward. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
the major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity at the
retail level, </p>

<p> and increased supplies available from Southwest Asia. (Note
that high- </p>

<p> purity heroin has been imported from Colombia in increasing
quantities </p>

<p> in the past year. This heroin from Colombia, which underwent
signature </p>

<p> analysis prior to DEA's development of a South American
heroin signature </p>

<p> in July 1993, was analyzed as having a Southwest Asian (SWA)
signature. </p>

<p> As a result, it may account in part for both the increased
purity and </p>

<p> quantity of SWA heroin available in the United States.) </p>

<p> Data from DEA's Domestic Monitor Program indicate the 1992
nationwide </p>

<p> average heroin purity at the retail (street) level was 37
percent, </p>

<p> considerably higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent
recorded in </p>

<p> 1991. Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest
in the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. </p>

<p> According to DEA's Heroin Signature Program (HSP), Southeast
Asian (SEA) </p>

<p> heroin was the predominant type of heroin available in the
United States </p>

<p> for the fifth year in a row, accounting for 44 percent of the
HSP </p>

<p> samples analyzed in FA 1992 and 58 percent of the total net
weight of </p>

<p> these samples. U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK
International </p>

<p> Airport, are primary entry points for heroin destined for the
U.S. </p>

<p> market, based on seizures analyzed through the HSP. The
nationwide </p>

<p> average net weight of airport seizures was almost 800 grams
and the </p>

<p> average purity of heroin seized at these airports was 73
percent. </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. (Estimates of
heroin use </p>

<p> from the Household Survey are considered very conservative
due to the </p>

<p> probable under-coverage of the population of heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. The survey
revealed that </p>

<p> 1.2 percent of the seniors in the class of 1992 had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, yet </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to the second half of FY 1992. During that period, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, the </p>

<p> percentage of patients who indicated that injection was their
primary </p>

<p> route of administration has decreased from 79.1 percent in FY
1989 to </p>

<p> 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same period, there was
an increase </p>

<p> in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin. Those who
snorted </p>

<p> heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Rates of opiate use (to include heroin) detected through
urinalysis </p>

<p> testing of recently booked male and female arrestees, as
reported by the </p>

<p> Drug Use Forecasting Program, remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States, particularly New York City,
and are </p>

<p> primarily responsible for smuggling the largest bulk
shipments, </p>

<p> generally in the multihundred-kilogram range. The largest
shipments are </p>

<p> secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial maritime
vessels and </p>

<p> air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are smuggled in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. </p>

<p> In addition to Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers, Nigerians
remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> rely primarily on dispatching large numbers of internal body
couriers </p>

<p> traveling aboard commercial airlines bound for the United
States. As a </p>

<p> result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to recruit
other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. </p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United
States are </p>

<p> highly cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are
based on </p>

<p> ethnic, familial, and tribal relationships. As a result, SWA
heroin </p>

<p> trafficking and distribution are generally more prevalent in
cities </p>

<p> having large populations from Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon,
Pakistan, </p>

<p> and Turkey, such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is produced almost exclusively for the U.S.
heroin </p>

<p> market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican heroin to
and within </p>

<p> the United States is controlled by organizations composed of
Mexican </p>

<p> nationals and Mexican Americans. Mexican trafficking
organizations are </p>

<p> often made up of family members, lifelong friends, and other
trusted </p>

<p> associates. </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. At present, Colombian
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers are attempting to establish distribution outlets
in the </p>

<p> United States, particularly in the metropolitan areas of the
northeast </p>

<p> and, as a result, are smuggling a heroin of very high purity,
generally </p>

<p> 80-plus percent. According to the El Paso Intelligence
Center, the </p>

<p> number of Colombian couriers who were arrested on commercial
airlines </p>

<p> carrying heroin into the United States increased from 41 in
1991 to over </p>

<p> 260 in 1992, with most of these arrests occurring at either
Miami or New </p>

<p> York's international airports. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Potency </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psychoactive
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla
plant </p>

<p> contains usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58
percent of </p>

<p> a sinsemilla plant contains usable material. The yield of a
cannabis </p>

<p> plant is determined by its diameter and the density of the
grow area. </p>

<p> The lower the plant density of the grow area, the higher the
yield of </p>

<p> usable material. The average plant yield for mature,
domestically grown </p>

<p> sinsemilla is approximately 1.25 pounds per plant. The
average plant </p>

<p> yield for mature, domestically grown commercial grade
marijuana is </p>

<p> approximately three-quarters of one pound per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Commercial grade marijuana prices rose from $350 to $600 per
pound 10 </p>

<p> years ago to $300 to $3,000 per pound in 1992. Sinsemilla
prices rose </p>

<p> from $1,000 to $2,000 per pound 10 years ago to $650 to
$9,600 per pound </p>

<p> in 1992. Law enforcement efforts have forced some cultivators
indoors to </p>

<p> avoid detection. Indoor growers cultivate higher potency
sinsemilla </p>

<p> marijuana, which permits them to charge higher prices.
Scarcity caused </p>

<p> by law enforcement operations also has increased prices. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
using </p>

<p> advanced agronomic techniques. As a result, the average THC
content of </p>

<p> marijuana has risen considerably in the last ten years.
Furthermore, </p>

<p> record-high THC contents were reported in 1992 and 1993.
These record- </p>

<p> high THC contents are an indicator of the continuing trend by
indoor </p>

<p> growers to produce higher potency marijuana. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 61.9 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, survey </p>

<p> data indicate that the frequency of marijuana use has
declined </p>

<p> substantially from 1985 to 1992. Overall, past-year,
past-month, and </p>

<p> past-week use of the drug nave diminished by nearly 45
percent during </p>

<p> that period </p>

<p> According to the National High School Survey on Drug Abuse,
the long- </p>

<p> term decline in the use of marijuana among 12th graders
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
12th </p>

<p> graders who believed there was &quot;great risk&quot;
associated with regular </p>

<p> marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the downward
use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. The
large </p>

<p> majority, approximately 80 percent, of patients treated for
cannabis- </p>

<p> related hospital emergencies use marijuana with other
substances. </p>

<p> Patients use marijuana most frequently with alcohol and
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use detected through urinalysis testing of recently
booked </p>

<p> male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
Forecasting </p>

<p> Program, increased significantly in many major U.S. cities in
1992. </p>

<p> Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Colombia ranked as a distant
second as a </p>

<p> foreign source of marijuana. Commencing in early 1992,
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers increased marijuana shipments to the United
States. </p>

<p> DEA, in conjunction with Federal and State law enforcement
agencies, </p>

<p> conducted an aggressive cannabis eradication program in 1992.
The effort </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of millions of cannabis plants,
the arrest </p>

<p> of thousands of violators, the forfeiture of millions of
dollars in </p>

<p> assets, and the seizure of several thousand weapons.
Moreover, the </p>

<p> number of indoor growing operations seized in 1992 (3,849)
reached an </p>

<p> all-time high. The movement toward indoor production is
believed due </p>

<p> primarily to successful law enforcement efforts to curtail
outdoor </p>

<p> cultivation. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> five States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated </p>

<p> cannabis eradicated during 1992. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is the most prevalent clandestinely
manufactured </p>

<p> controlled substance in the United States. Availability is
concentrated </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States where
most </p>

<p> clandestine methamphetamine manufacture occurs. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. Currently, </p>

<p> methamphetamine prices range from $5,000 to $22,000 per
pound, $300 to </p>

<p> $2,500 per ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> Use </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans, 12 years of age and older,
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Survey data
for prior </p>

<p> years are unavailable. Survey data for 1992 are not yet
available.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data also indicate that methamphetamine
abuse is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles. In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> According to DEA reporting, 288 domestic methamphetamine
laboratories </p>

<p> were seized during 1992, accounting for 87 percent of all
clandestine </p>

<p> dangerous drug laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure
represents a nine- </p>

<p> percent decrease from the previous year's total of 315
laboratories </p>

<p> seized and continues the downward trend in laboratory
seizures, which </p>

<p> began in 1990. </p>

<p> The main reason for the decrease in laboratory seizures is
the ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical-control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
essential </p>

<p> chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of dangerous
drugs. Over the </p>

<p> past three years, most States have passed legislation similar
to the </p>

<p> CDTA. </p>

<p> Approximately 83 percent of the methamphetamine laboratory
seizures </p>

<p> during 1992 occurred in the DEA Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles,
Phoenix, </p>

<p> San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, Field Divisions. This
clearly </p>

<p> indicates that the manufacture of methamphetamine is still
based </p>

<p> primarily in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Manufacturing/Distribution Organizations </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations-from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations-currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. (Although late arrivals in the </p>

<p> methamphetamine arena, Mexican traffickers are capable of
using their </p>

<p> high-volume production methods and large-scale distribution
networks to </p>

<p> substantially increase the drug's availability in the United
States. For </p>

<p> this reason, domestic law enforcement considers the Mexican
poly-drug </p>

<p> traffickers involvement in methamphetamine a significant
threat.) </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for laboratory operators to
obtain needed </p>

<p> chemicals. Consequently, trafficking organizations have been
forced to </p>

<p> seek new sources and develop ways in which to circumvent the
law. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> Availability/Price/Purity </p>

<p> Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) availability has increased
in the last </p>

<p> two to three years and it is available in at least retail
quantities in </p>

<p> virtually every State in the United States. The sources of
supply for </p>

<p> most of the LSD available in the United States are located in
the </p>

<p> northern California area. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive with an average street dosage
unit or </p>

<p> &quot;hit&quot; costing approximately five dollars, and often
as little as one or </p>

<p> two dollars. Retail-level doses are seen primarily in blotter
paper </p>

<p> form. </p>

<p> Currently, LSD potency or strength, which ranges from 20 to
80 </p>

<p> micrograms per dosage unit, is considerably below levels
reported during </p>

<p> the 1960s and early 1970s when potency ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> (or higher) per dosage unit. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991
estimated that 11.8 </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age or older have used LSD at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime compared to 8.4 million in 1985. (Survey
data for 1992 </p>

<p> are not yet available.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, current </p>

<p> (monthly) use of LSD among 10th and 12th grade students
remained </p>

<p> relatively stable from 1991 to 1992. Among 8th graders,
however, current </p>

<p> use of LSD increased during that same time frame from 0.6
percent to 0.9 </p>

<p> percent. Moreover, past-year use of LSD rose in all three
grade levels </p>

<p> from 1991 to 1992. In fact, past-year use of LSD among
seniors in the </p>

<p> class of 1992 increased to the highest level since at least
1985. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> An increasing number of individuals are attempting to
manufacture LSD. </p>

<p> Many of these individuals are not associated with the
traditional </p>

<p> northern California groups that are believed to have produced
most of </p>

<p> the LSD available in the United States since the late 1960s. </p>

<p> Distribution </p>

<p> At the wholesale production and distribution level, LSD
remains tightly </p>

<p> controlled by California-based organizations, which have
operated with </p>

<p> relative impunity for over two decades. Mid-level
distribution networks </p>

<p> in the United States are generally comprised of young adults
who have </p>

<p> known each other through long years of association and common
interests. </p>

<p> Public and private mail systems appear to be the primary
means used for </p>

<p> the transportation and distribution of retail and wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> of LSD. </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> Availability/Price </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities. During 1992, PCP
in liquid </p>

<p> form, the most common form available in the United States,
sold for $150 </p>

<p> to $1,000 per ounce nationally. The lowest liquid ounce
prices were </p>

<p> reported in Los Angeles, the source for most of the PCP
trafficked in </p>

<p> the United States. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's and again
from the </p>

<p> mid-to- late 1970's. In 1978, PCP was transferred from
Schedule III to </p>

<p> Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, thus
classifying it as a </p>

<p> drug with a high potential for abuse. From the period 1981
through 1985, </p>

<p> abuse of the drug escalated significantly, particularly among
persons </p>

<p> under the age of 21. Around 1986, and continuing through the
late 1980's </p>

<p> and early 1990's, demand for PCP was displaced in large
measure by the </p>

<p> widespread availability and use of crack cocaine. More
recently, </p>

<p> however, there are indications that PCP abuse is increasing
once again </p>

<p> in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. On the other hand, according to the
1992 National </p>

<p> High School Senior Survey on Drug Abuse, PCP use among 12th
graders has </p>

<p> declined significantly during the past seven years. This
diminished use </p>

<p> is believed due in large part to a significant increase among
12th </p>

<p> graders in the perceived risk of harm associated with PCP
usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, a more </p>

<p> than 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased PCP
abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> Trafficking and Illicit Manufacture </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. No </p>

<p> PCP laboratories have been seized thus far in 1993. PCP
laboratory </p>

<p> seizures since the mid-1980's have ranged from three to 21
per year, </p>

<p> totals which are considerably less than the high of 79
reported in 1978. </p>

<p> COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> In 1992, domestic cocaine prices fluctuated due to successful
domestic </p>

<p> and international law enforcement operations, which caused a
short-term </p>

<p> (3-month) impact on cocaine trafficking from South America.
Following a </p>

<p> period of adjustment, cocaine traffickers once again found
the means to </p>

<p> facilitate the shipment of multiton quantities of cocaine to
the United </p>

<p> States. In 1992, cocaine prices ranged from $11,000 to
$42,000 per </p>

<p> kilogram nationally in comparison to 1991 prices, which
ranged from </p>

<p> $11,000 to $40,000 per kilogram nationally. During April
through June </p>

<p> 1992, shortages of wholesale quantities of cocaine resulted
in an </p>

<p> increase in the kilogram price in many major U.S.
metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Throughout the remainder of the year, however, cocaine was
readily </p>

<p> available as kilogram prices in virtually all major
metropolitan areas </p>

<p> returned to lower levels. Preliminary data for early 1993
indicate that </p>

<p> kilogram prices remain at low levels. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of cocaine at the kilogram, ounce, and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 83, 74, and 64 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to </p>

<p> 86, 72, and 59 percent, respectively, during 1991. A
temporary decline </p>

<p> in purity at all levels of the traffic was noted during July
through </p>

<p> September 1992; however, by year's end, purity at all levels
had </p>

<p> increased once again. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The 1992 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (see
appendix) showed </p>

<p> that the number of past-year and past-month users of cocaine
has </p>

<p> decreased significantly since the peak year of 1985. During
1992, five </p>

<p> million Americans 12 years of age and older had used cocaine
in the past </p>

<p> year compared to 12.2 million in 1985. In 1992, 1.3 million
had used </p>

<p> cocaine in the past month compared to 5.8 million in 1985.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> frequent or more intense use of cocaine has not shown
statistically </p>

<p> significant change during the past several years. Among the
five million </p>

<p> people who used cocaine in the past year, 642,000 used it
once a week or </p>

<p> more in 1992 compared to 625,000 in 1991 and 662,00 in 1990. </p>

<p> The survey also showed that approximately 80 percent of
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine users were young adults ages 18 to 34 in 1992. As in
the past, </p>

<p> the rate of past-month cocaine use in 1992 was highest among
young </p>

<p> adults 18 to 25 years old (1.8 percent of the U.S.
population) and ages </p>

<p> 26 to 34 years (1.4 percent of the U.S. population). The
past-month </p>

<p> cocaine prevalence rate for the 12- to 17-year-old age group
has </p>

<p> decreased from 1.1 percent of the U.S. population in 1988 to
0.3 percent </p>

<p> in 1992. Similarly, the 18- to 25-year-old age group has
experienced </p>

<p> dramatic decreases in prevalence from 4.5 percent of the U.S.
population </p>

<p> in 1988 to 1.8 percent in 1992. For the 26- to 34-year-old
age group, </p>

<p> the rate has declined from 2.6 percent to 1.4 percent. The
rate for </p>

<p> persons aged 35 and older has shown variability, but remained
virtually </p>

<p> unchanged since 1988 (0.3 percent of the U.S. population and
0.2 percent </p>

<p> in 1992). Lastly, the prevalence rate of past-month cocaine
use among </p>

<p> the total U.S. population was estimated at 0.6 percent in
1992 compared </p>

<p> to 1.5 percent in 1988 and 0.9 percent in 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug </p>

<p> Abuse(see appendix for additional survey information),
cocaine use </p>

<p> continued to decline among high school seniors. Survey
results showed </p>

<p> 6.1 percent of seniors in the class of 1992 said they had
used cocaine </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime, down from 7.8 percent in the
class of </p>

<p> 1991 and down from a peak of 17.3 percent in the class of
1985. Among </p>

<p> 10th graders, lifetime cocaine use decreased from 4.1 percent
in 1991 to </p>

<p> 3.3 percent in 1992. Among 8th graders, however, lifetime use
of cocaine </p>

<p> increased from 2.3 percent in 1991 to 2.9 percent in 1992,
and past-year </p>

<p> use increased from 1.1 percent to 1.5 percent. </p>

<p> Other findings from the survey indicate that fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional cocaine or
crack cocaine </p>

<p> use than did 8th graders in 1991. There was also a decrease
in the </p>

<p> proportion of 10th graders saying there is great risk of harm
with </p>

<p> occasional cocaine use. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (see
appendix for </p>

<p> further information on DAWN) shows that the estimated number
of </p>

<p> nationwide cocaine-related emergency room episodes, which had
been </p>

<p> increasing at a fairly constant rate from the early-to-late
1980's, </p>

<p> declined significantly from FY 1989 to FY 1990. During the
latter half </p>

<p> of FY 1991, however, the number of episodes increased once
again and </p>

<p> appears to have stabilized at high levels since that time. A
number of </p>

<p> drug epidemiologists and treatment specialists believe a
possible </p>

<p> explanation for this trend reversal is that many hard-core
cocaine users </p>

<p> are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.
As a </p>

<p> result, an increasing number of users are seeking public
medical </p>

<p> assistance. </p>

<p> Reporting from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (see

<p> are now experiencing the consequences of long-term addiction.
As a </p>

<p> result, an increasing number of users are seeking public
medical </p>

<p> assistance. </p>

<p> Nationwide, during the fourth quarter of FY 1992,
approximately one in </p>

<p> four(28.3%) emergency room drug abuse episodes involved
cocaine. </p>

<p> Metropolitan areas having a significantly higher proportion
of drug </p>

<p> emergencies involving cocaine include: Baltimore (63.5%),
Atlanta </p>

<p> (56.3%), Philadelphia (54.1%), New Orleans (48.2%), Chicago
(46.7%), New </p>

<p> York (46.3%), Newark (44.2%), Detroit (41.4%), Miami (39.1%),
</p>

<p> Washington, D.C. (37.5%), St. Louis (36.0%), and Boston
(34.8%). </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that smoking continues to
be the </p>

<p> predominant route of administration used by patients admitted
to DAWN </p>

<p> emergency rooms for cocaine-related problems. The percentage
of patients </p>

<p> who indicated that smoking was their primary method of
administration </p>

<p> increased from 34.3 percent during FY 1989 to 41.4 percent in
FY 1992. </p>

<p> During the same time frame, there was a decrease in the
percentage of </p>

<p> patients who injected or snorted cocaine. Those who injected
or snorted </p>

<p> cocaine decreased from 22.0 percent and 14.0 percent,
respectively, </p>

<p> during FY 1989, to 20.2 percent and 11.1 percent,
respectively, during </p>

<p> FY 1992. </p>

<p> Rates of cocaine use detected through urinalysis testing of
recently </p>

<p> booked male and female arrestees, as reported by the Drug Use
</p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) (see appendix for further
information on DUF), </p>

<p> remained high in many major U.S. cities in 1992. In fact,
rates of </p>

<p> cocaine seducing the past year were substantially higher than
those for </p>

<p> opiate and marijuana use. Among the highest was Philadelphia,
where 63 </p>

<p> percent of the sampled population tested positive for cocaine
use. In </p>

<p> New York City, the figure was 62 percent; in Atlanta, 58
percent; in </p>

<p> Chicago, 56 percent; in Miami, 56 percent; in Cleveland, 53
percent; and </p>

<p> in Los Angeles, 52 percent. Cocaine use among recently booked
female </p>

<p> arrestees was also high in many cities. In New York City, 72
percent of </p>

<p> the female arrestees sampled tested positive for the use of
cocaine; in </p>

<p> Philadelphia, 67 percent; in Cleveland, 66 percent; in
Washington, D.C., </p>

<p> 64 percent; in Kansas City, 62 percent; in St. Louis, 62
percent; and in </p>

<p> Detroit, 62 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> General Overview </p>

<p> The primary domestic importation points for cocaine destined
for U.S. </p>

<p> consumption remain Arizona, southern California, south
Florida, and </p>

<p> Texas. The principal cities utilized by Colombian cartels for
</p>

<p> distribution of multi-hundred or multi-thousand kilogram
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine include Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.
While the </p>

<p> Medellin Cartel remains a significant supplier of cocaine to
the major </p>

<p> U.S. distribution cities, the Cali Cartel continues to
control most of </p>

<p> the cocaine brought into New York City, Miami, and Los
Angeles. Staging </p>

<p> sites in the southwestern United States, where some
stockpiling occurs </p>

<p> while awaiting transportation, are supplied with cocaine by
Mexican </p>

<p> smugglers using couriers or tractor-trailers, other vehicles,
and </p>

<p> commercial cargo. Organized groups of Cubans, Dominicans,
Jamaicans, </p>

<p> Mexicans, and African-American gangs provide retail-level
distribution </p>

<p> of the drug in major U.S. cities. In addition, both the
Medellin and </p>

<p> Cali Cartels maintain operational headquarters in major U.S.
cities to </p>

<p> control wholesale distribution networks. During the last
year, as in the </p>

<p> past, traffickers shifted or diversified trafficking routes
following </p>

<p> major seizures. Traffickers appear to be only temporarily
affected by </p>

<p> the interdiction of pipelines and are taking an average of 10
to 14 days </p>

<p> to reestablish operations. This suggests continued use of
imaginative </p>

<p> concealment methods and the use or maintenance of
multiple-delivery </p>

<p> pipelines and systems to avoid law enforcement. </p>

<p> Routes </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers perceiving enhanced law enforcement
activity along </p>

<p> the United States-Mexican border and in the western Caribbean
have </p>

<p> subsequently diversified their smuggling routes into the
United States. </p>

<p> DEA field divisions report that cocaine traffickers are
increasingly </p>

<p> using routes employed four to six years ago. This
diversification </p>

<p> includes greater use of the eastern Caribbean and the eastern
Bahamas as </p>

<p> well as increased importation into the eastern United States.
This trend </p>

<p> was highlighted by the July 1992 seizure of 5.2 metric tons
of cocaine </p>

<p> in Panama which was destined for Baltimore. Moreover, DEA
Miami reports </p>

<p> that the Medellin Cartel has established a significant
presence in The </p>

<p> Bahamas, utilizing the area as a transit point for cocaine en
route to </p>

<p> south Florida. </p>

<p> Increased cocaine trafficking through the eastern Caribbean
includes </p>

<p> greater use of Puerto Rico, which appears to be a primary
target of </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers who use it as a transshipment point for
cocaine </p>

<p> destined for the United States, Canada, and Europe. While the
smuggling </p>

<p> of cocaine by general aviation aircraft into Puerto Rico
continues, </p>

<p> maritime smuggling is the primary method of transporting
cocaine to the </p>

<p> island. The appeal of Puerto Rico as a cocaine transit point
is enhanced </p>

<p> by two factors: the first is the proximity of Puerto Rico to
South </p>

<p> America, and the second is that once cocaine is successfully
smuggled </p>

<p> into Puerto Rico, it can be shipped to the continental United
States </p>

<p> with little likelihood of U.S. Customs screening. </p>

<p> Since early 1992, DEA field divisions have increasingly cited
Central </p>

<p> American countries as transshipment points for U.S.-bound
cocaine </p>

<p> shipments. This was highlighted by the April 1992 seizure of
6.7 metric </p>

<p> tons of cocaine in Miami transshipped through Guatemala and
by the July </p>

<p> 1992 seizure in Panama noted previously. During the past
year, every </p>

<p> Central American country was cited as a transshipment point
for U.S.- </p>

<p> boundcocaine. Reporting indicates cocaine is transported from
source </p>

<p> countries to Central American countries by land, air, and sea
</p>

<p> conveyances. From Central America, cocaine shipments are
transported to </p>

<p> the United States by land, sea, and air directly or through
Mexico. </p>

<p> U.S. law enforcement efforts along the United States-Mexican
border </p>

<p> continue to force regional cocaine traffickers to alter their
</p>

<p> operations. DEA and U.S. Border Patrol seizures since early
1992 </p>

<p> indicate that cocaine traffickers are increasingly
transporting smaller </p>

<p> (10 to 50 kilograms) cocaine shipments across less trafficked
ports of </p>

<p> entry such as Calexico and Tecate, as opposed to transporting
large </p>

<p> (multihundred kilogram) cocaine shipments across more
frequently used </p>

<p> border crossing points such as San Ysidro. Additionally, in
response to </p>

<p> law enforcement in southern California, traffickers
increasingly use </p>

<p> U.S. ports of entry as far east as McAllen, Texas, to smuggle
cocaine to </p>

<p> California. Methods of Transportation and Concealment </p>

<p> Maritime Transportation </p>

<p> The use of maritime containerized cargo to smuggle bulk
quantities of </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States continues to challenge U.S.
Government </p>

<p> drug interdiction efforts. Many DEA field divisions report
the use of </p>

<p> cargo containers to conceal and transport cocaine among
legitimate </p>

<p> goods. Additionally, cocaine is sometimes hidden in the walls
and </p>

<p> support beams of cargo containers as well as in, or attached
to, the </p>

<p> vessels themselves. DEA reporting indicates an increased
demand by </p>

<p> cocaine traffickers for cargo ships in order to transport
bulk </p>

<p> quantities of U.S.-bound cocaine. Furthermore, U.S. Customs
reports the </p>

<p> large volume of cargo arriving at domestic ports, coupled
with the U.S. </p>

<p> Customs capability of inspecting only a small portion of this
cargo, </p>

<p> continue to be factors operating in favor of smuggling
organizations. </p>

<p> The use of low-profile vessels by cocaine traffickers has
made maritime </p>

<p> interdiction extremely difficult off the coast of Puerto
Rico. DEA </p>

<p> reporting indicates these vessels, fabricated of wood and/or
fiberglass </p>

<p> and measuring up to only 40 feet in length, are difficult to
visually </p>

<p> detect since their coloring blends with the ocean. Moreover,
their </p>

<p> profiles of only one to two feet above the water are not
always </p>

<p> detectable by radar. Investigative reporting indicates these
vessels </p>

<p> transport up to one metric ton of cocaine and sail directly
from </p>

<p> Colombia to Puerto Rico without being detected. </p>

<p> Cocaine trafficking organizations also rely heavily on the
use of </p>

<p> noncommercial maritime vessels. Pleasure craft and fishing
vessels are </p>

<p> used to smuggle cocaine from source countries into the United
States. </p>

<p> Pleasure craft carrying cocaine enter U.S. waters by blending
in with </p>

<p> weekend &quot;traffic &quot;along the southeastern coast
where weekend vessel </p>

<p> activity is heavy. Fishing vessels are also used to carry
cocaine </p>

<p> directly into the United States as well as to transfer
cocaine to other </p>

<p> vessels off the coast. </p>

<p> Air Transportation </p>

<p> DEA San Diego, Los Angeles, and Miami report cocaine
trafficking </p>

<p> organizations have increased their use of airdrop operations.
Cocaine </p>

<p> traffickers are airdropping cocaine shipments in the
Caribbean and off </p>

<p> the coast of, as well as within, Central America and southern
Mexico. </p>

<p> A combination of law enforcement successes, including those
of the </p>

<p> United States-Mexican Northern Border Response Force, and
conflicts </p>

<p> between trafficking organizations for control of clandestine
airstrips </p>

<p> have contributed to trafficker avoidance of landing aircraft
in northern </p>

<p> Mexico. Consequently, a number of smuggling organizations,
including </p>

<p> traffickers associated with the Cali Cartel, feel it is less
risky to </p>

<p> airdrop cocaine shipments to ground or maritime crews in
Central America </p>

<p> or the Caribbean than to land aircraft in northern Mexico. </p>

<p> South American cocaine traffickers have recently acquired
several large </p>

<p> cargo aircraft for the transport of cocaine, thereby
increasing cargo </p>

<p> capacity while overcoming the limited flight range of smaller
aircraft. </p>

<p> Moreover, cocaine traffickers within The Bahamas and
elsewhere in the </p>

<p> Caribbean continue to use smaller aircraft as decoys to
divert law </p>

<p> enforcement interdiction assets from actual smuggling
operations being </p>

<p> conducted in a different locale. </p>

<p> Land Transportation </p>

<p> Cocaine couriers employ several methods to counter trafficker
profiles </p>

<p> at or near the United States-Mexican border; these methods
include </p>

<p> traveling in family-type groups with women and children to
avoid </p>

<p> suspicion at checkpoints, hiring non-Mexicans to transport
cocaine from </p>

<p> United States-Mexican border areas into Los Angeles, and
recruiting </p>

<p> Anglo drivers and females to transport cocaine shipments. </p>

<p> Kilogram bricks continue to be the predominant form of
packaged cocaine </p>

<p> smuggled into the United States. During the past year, DEA
field </p>

<p> divisions have frequently cited rubber/waterproofed packaging
of </p>

<p> cocaine. Additionally, seizures of multihundred kilograms of
cocaine </p>

<p> concealed in U-Haul cardboard boxes and 55-gallon drums
increased. Tile- </p>

<p> shaped cocaine (2&quot;x 8&quot;x 8&quot;), vacuum-packed in
metallic-type material, </p>

<p> has also been reported. </p>

<p> DEA and the U.S. Customs Service reported traffickers smuggle
liquefied </p>

<p> cocaine into the United States concealed in water tanks of
mobile homes </p>

<p> and recreational vehicles. Traffickers also have labeled
55-gallon drums </p>

<p> of liquid cocaine to reflect the climatic conditions of the
locale where </p>

<p> the drums are shipped, i.e., a shipment to Chicago in the
winter is </p>

<p> labeled &quot;antifreeze.&quot; During May 1992, U.S. Customs
in Houston made the </p>

<p> first seizure of liquid cocaine at Houston Intercontinental
Airport from </p>

<p> an Ecuadorian national enroute to New York City. DEA Miami
reported </p>

<p> small amounts of liquid cocaine are sometimes concealed
within liquor </p>

<p> bottles. Moreover, DEA San Diego and Baltimore reported
traffickers are </p>

<p> smuggling liquid cocaine into their areas of jurisdiction. </p>

<p> Within the United States, cocaine traffickers continue to use
commercial </p>

<p> and private vehicles, trains, airlines, and the postal
service to ship </p>

<p> cocaine. The use of concealed compartments within vehicles is
commonly </p>

<p> cited by DEA field divisions. During the past year, several
cocaine </p>

<p> seizures involved multiple concealment sites within the same
vehicle, a </p>

<p> smuggling technique associated with marijuana trafficking.
Popular </p>

<p> vehicles among traffickers for transporting cocaine include
Nissan </p>

<p> vehicles and mini-vans. Additionally, some transportation
organizations </p>

<p> use rental vehicles to circumvent vehicle seizures. </p>

<p> Cocaine traffickers who use tractor-trailers employ several
methods to </p>

<p> circumvent law enforcement. There is extensive use of
elaborate hidden </p>

<p> compartments to secrete cocaine within tractor-trailers.
Additionally, </p>

<p> cocaine is often hidden among legitimate produce such as
onions and </p>

<p> watermelons. On the West Coast, tractor-trailers obtain
produce in the </p>

<p> San Joaquin Valley to conceal cocaine destined for the
Midwest and East </p>

<p> Coast cities. Concealment of cocaine in tractor-trailers also
includes </p>

<p> the use of compartments in air-conditioning units, radiators,
and </p>

<p> batteries, containers welded in tire rims, and false walls.
In the </p>

<p> Southwest, large commercial vehicles and trucks are a primary
method for </p>

<p> transporting cocaine. An increase has been noted in the use
of tractor- </p>

<p> trailers to transport bulk cocaine shipments into the Chicago
area. DEA </p>

<p> reports truckers transporting cocaine sealed in odor-reducing
wax among </p>

<p> legitimate cargo to avoid detection at checkpoints and
scales. Extensive </p>

<p> use of commercial trucks to transport cocaine from the Los
Angeles </p>

<p> metropolitan area to destinations throughout the United
States has </p>

<p> occurred during the past year. In addition, traffickers
continue to seek </p>

<p> opportunities to recruit U.S. port officials to facilitate
large cocaine </p>

<p> shipments into the United States from Mexico by
tractor-trailer. </p>

<p> Domestic Distribution </p>

<p> The Cali Cartel's method of operation in the United States
remains </p>

<p> highly sophisticated and compartmentalized. U.S. bases of
operation are </p>

<p> comprised of multiple cells operating within major
metropolitan areas to </p>

<p> include Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York,
Philadelphia, and San </p>

<p> Francisco. The operators of these cells receive orders
directly from </p>

<p> top-level cartel managers in Colombia and operate
independently of other </p>

<p> cells within the same metropolitan area. Cell operators
utilize the </p>

<p> latest technology, such as computers, pagers, and facsimile
machines, in </p>

<p> their daily operations. Cellular telephones are often bought
in bulk </p>

<p> quantities and discarded after being used for several months
or less in </p>

<p> order to thwart law enforcement telephone intercept efforts. </p>

<p> In general, the Medellin Cartel's method of operation in the
United </p>

<p> States is not as compartmentalized as that of the Cali
Cartel. The drug </p>

<p> trafficking groups, which comprise the Medellin Cartel,
employ a group </p>

<p> decision-making process at the top level as opposed to the
hierarchical </p>

<p> decision-making process employed by the Cali Cartel. At the
lower </p>

<p> levels, trafficking groups can transact business with less
restrictions </p>

<p> on their choice of business associates. </p>

<p> Peruvian traffickers reportedly ship cocaine concealed in
maritime </p>

<p> vessels and aircraft to the United States and distribute it
in the </p>

<p> Houston area independent of Colombian organizations. The use
of Peru as </p>

<p> a source area for multiton shipments of cocaine was evidenced
during </p>

<p> January 1992 by the seizure of five metric tons of cocaine
aboard a </p>

<p> maritime vessel. The vessel originated in Peru and was
reportedly </p>

<p> destined for the United States and Canada when it was
interdicted in the </p>

<p> Caribbean. </p>

<p> Hispanic organizations, particularly Colombian and Mexican,
continue to </p>

<p> dominate wholesale cocaine trafficking and distribution
within the </p>

<p> United States. However, since early 1992, diverse ethnic
groups, </p>

<p> including those of Middle Eastern, East European, Central
Asian, and </p>

<p> East Asian descent, have become involved in these activities
at all </p>

<p> levels of the domestic traffic. </p>

<p> Cocaine violators in urban areas, such as Boston and Atlanta,
have </p>

<p> expanded their distribution networks into rural areas, which
have </p>

<p> limited law enforcement resources, thereby reducing the risk
of </p>

<p> investigation and arrest. </p>

<p> MISCELLANEOUS </p>

<p> During 1992, the exchange of cocaine for heroin was reported
in Boston, </p>

<p> Calexico, New York City, and San Diego. The frequency of such
exchanges </p>

<p> appears to be increasing and involves foreign and domestic
heroin </p>

<p> traffickers seeking cocaine sources in the United States. In
addition, </p>

<p> during the past year, Southwest Asian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> sent heroin and opium via the international mail system to
affiliates in </p>

<p> the United States who then purchased cocaine for export to
Europe. </p>

<p> In 1992, four cocaine base conversion laboratories were
seized within </p>

<p> the United States; two in New York City, one in California
and one in </p>

<p> Florida. One of the laboratories seized in New York City was </p>

<p> operational. This represented the first functioning cocaine
laboratory </p>

<p> seized in that city since 1987. Additionally, the operational
New York </p>

<p> City laboratory used a vapor eliminating device. The device,
the first </p>

<p> encountered by DEA that employed dry ice, allowed the
laboratory to </p>

<p> function in a densely populated area without the strong
chemical odors </p>

<p> normally associated with clandestine cocaine conversion
laboratories. To </p>

<p> date in 1993, only one cocaine base conversion laboratory has
been </p>

<p> seized within the United States in Hurleyville, New York. </p>

<p> Drug traffickers use high-tech equipment, including
night-vision goggles </p>

<p> and radios with scramblers, as well as military hardware
including </p>

<p> assault rifles, hand grenades, and bulletproof vests.
Trafficking </p>

<p> organizations use scouts with radios to monitor law
enforcement </p>

<p> activities along the United States-Mexican border. A Texas
cocaine </p>

<p> organization recently attempted to purchase hand-held radios
for </p>

<p> surveillance and body armor for their street-level dealers.
Traffickers </p>

<p> have become more sophisticated in the use of electronics
including </p>

<p> scanners with police frequencies. </p>

<p> Countermeasures employed by cocaine traffickers against U.S.
law </p>

<p> enforcement include the use of counter-surveillance and paid
informants. </p>

<p> Some traffickers study law enforcement methods of operation
by reviewing </p>

<p> evidence documents during court proceedings. Reportedly,
defense </p>

<p> attorneys employed by traffickers obtain investigative
documents through </p>

<p> the &quot;right of the discovery process&quot; and then
transmit by facsimile </p>

<p> informational reports to Colombia. </p>

<p> CRACK COCAINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> The simplicity of the crack conversion process allows any
person with </p>

<p> access to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) to be a potential
source of crack. </p>

<p> Because cocaine HCl is plentiful and cheap and can be
obtained in </p>

<p> virtually every area of the country, crack is, therefore,
widely </p>

<p> available. </p>

<p> Crack is reported by drug epidemiologists and treatment
professionals to </p>

<p> be the illegal drug of choice in many U.S. cities. Notable
exceptions </p>

<p> include cities and towns along the southwest border, where
drug </p>

<p> traffickers are primarily concerned with transshipping the
large amounts </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, marijuana, and heroin that are smuggled into
the United </p>

<p> States, and certain areas within several north-central and
northeastern </p>

<p> States that lack large ethnic minority communities,
traditional </p>

<p> strongholds for crack distribution and abuse. Nonetheless,
three Haitian </p>

<p> crack sellers were recently arrested in Portland, Maine,
indicating that </p>

<p> no region is immune to crack trafficking. </p>

<p> Crack distribution and use appear to have reached the
saturation point </p>

<p> in large urban areas throughout the country. Intensive
competition in </p>

<p> the mid-to-late 1980's inundated the largest consumer pools
with crack. </p>

<p> As a result, a number of crack trafficking groups have
relocated or </p>

<p> extended their operations to smaller cities, towns, and rural
areas; the </p>

<p> primary motivation for this is profit. Simply put, a rock or
vial of </p>

<p> crack that sells for $5 to $10 in a large, well-populated
area will </p>

<p> command a significantly higher price, usually $25 to $40 in a
smaller, </p>

<p> less populated area. </p>

<p> The national price for a rock or vial of crack ranges from as
low as $2 </p>

<p> to as high as $75 but it generally sells for $10 to $50,
depending upon </p>

<p> the size, normally 1/10 to 1/2 gram. In general, the larger
cities have </p>

<p> the lowest retail prices. Reporting from New York City
indicates a </p>

<p> dosage unit of crack sells for as low as two dollars, while a
single </p>

<p> puff on a crack pipe can be obtained for as little as 75
cents. </p>

<p> Reporting from Philadelphia and Detroit indicates that crack
can be </p>

<p> purchased for as low as $2.50 and $3.00 per dosage unit,
respectively. </p>

<p> Prices for gram quantities of crack generally range from $45
to $150 </p>

<p> nationally. At the ounce and kilogram level, crack prices are
comparable </p>

<p> to cocaine HCl prices and usually range from $475 to $2,500
per ounce </p>

<p> and from $17,000 to $35,000 per kilogram. </p>

<p> In the mid-to-late 1980's, a readily available supply of
inexpensive and </p>

<p> high quality crack at the retail level virtually eliminated
any need for </p>

<p> users to perform the crack conversion process themselves.
Indeed, </p>

<p> quality control was a major factor in marketing the drug.
Analysis of </p>

<p> crack samples by DEA laboratories revealed that purity was
consistently </p>

<p> high during that period, averaging 80-plus percent. </p>

<p> Although retail purity remains high, averaging almost 83
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, sellers in some areas of the country, such as New York,
Los </p>

<p> Angeles, and several cities in the Southeast, are selling
poor-quality </p>

<p> crack, cut with adulterants such as lidocaine and procaine.
These </p>

<p> adulterants increase the weight or the size of the crack and,
therefore, </p>

<p> the profits. Many retailers will sell recently prepared crack
that has </p>

<p> not been dried thoroughly and is still wet from the
conversion process. </p>

<p> This practice is most profitable when dealing in wholesale
quantities </p>

<p> where transactions are strictly determined by weight. At the
dosage unit </p>

<p> or retail level, where the size of the rock is of greater
concern, </p>

<p> procaine serves to increase the dimensions of the rock by
adding holes </p>

<p> or pockets of air, giving rise to the street term
&quot;blow-up.&quot; Obviously, </p>

<p> the smaller the amount of pure cocaine present in the rock,
the less </p>

<p> intense euphoric reaction the user will experience. In
addition, a </p>

<p> limited number of retailers are selling bogus or
&quot;beat&quot; crack to </p>

<p> unfamiliar customers because their regular customers consume
virtually </p>

<p> the entire supply. Substitutes include soap, chalk, plaster,
peanuts, </p>

<p> popcorn, and candle wax, which is known on the street as
&quot;perp.&quot; </p>

<p> Practices such as these are creating an increasing number of </p>

<p> dissatisfied and wary customers. An almost inexhaustible
supply of </p>

<p> cheap, high-purity cocaine HCl, combined with a relatively
simple and </p>

<p> safe production process, makes home conversion by the crack
user more </p>

<p> appealing than the risk of purchasing and smoking low-quality
or sham </p>

<p> crack. In fact, sellers in some northeastern cities sell two
qualities </p>

<p> of cocaine HCl, a high-purity powder for users who will
perform the </p>

<p> conversion to crack themselves, and a low-purity powder for
ingestion </p>

<p> through snorting only. It has also been reported that users
in Chicago </p>

<p> prefer the freebase method of conversion in the belief that
this method </p>

<p> yields a higher purity product than the crack conversion
process. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992 showed
that the </p>

<p> number of lifetime, past-year and past-month users of crack
declined </p>

<p> significantly from 1991 to 1992. The highest percentages of
crack use </p>

<p> were among those who were disproportionately represented in </p>

<p> socioeconomic groups that have historically faced increased
health </p>

<p> risks, including African-Americans, the unemployed, and
high-school </p>

<p> dropouts, as well as young adults aged 18 to 34. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> lifetime use of crack among high school seniors declined from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992; however, past-year, past-month, and daily use of crack
by this </p>

<p> group remained relatively stable during that period.
Nevertheless, </p>

<p> overall frequency of crack use among high school seniors has
decreased </p>

<p> substantially since 1987. </p>

<p> Of particular concern is the slight rise in frequency of
crack use among </p>

<p> 8th graders. From 1991 to 1992, survey data indicate that an
increasing </p>

<p> number of 8th grade students had used crack during their
lifetime as </p>

<p> well as on a yearly and monthly basis. Also, fewer 8th
graders in 1992 </p>

<p> associated great risk of harm with occasional crack use than
did 8th </p>

<p> graders in 1991. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Trafficking/Distribution Levels </p>

<p> Crack trafficking is conducted at three broad levels, namely,
wholesale </p>

<p> trafficking, mid-level distribution, and retail selling. It
must be </p>

<p> emphasized that these classifications are not concrete and
the </p>

<p> activities of a specific violator or group may vary. For
example, as </p>

<p> will be explained later, the functions of a Jamaican posse
may encompass </p>

<p> all three levels within the same organization. </p>

<p> Wholesale Trafficking: Crack traffickers purchase cocaine HCl
in </p>

<p> kilogram or multikilogram allotments from traditional cocaine
HCl </p>

<p> sources, including Colombians and Mexicans. The wholesale
traffickers </p>

<p> will either package the cocaine HCl into ounce quantities or
convert it </p>

<p> into crack themselves and then divide it into ounces for sale
at the </p>

<p> next level. Wholesalers usually represent large groups that
are </p>

<p> responsible for the majority of the interstate transportation
of crack </p>

<p> and cocaine HCl intended for crack conversion. </p>

<p> The higher levels of crack trafficking are controlled by many
small (up </p>

<p> to 10 members) and mid-sized (10 to 40 members) trafficking </p>

<p> organizations consisting of bands of individuals from
distinct ethnic </p>

<p> groups. The main participants involved in wholesale crack
trafficking </p>

<p> are Los Angeles-based street gangs, Jamaican posses, and
Haitian and </p>

<p> Dominican groups. Without exception, each of these groups
started out as </p>

<p> poly-drug traffickers, dealing primarily in marijuana and
cocaine HCl, </p>

<p> and continue to sell these drugs. Similarly, street-level
sellers often </p>

<p> sell retail units of other drugs in addition to crack. </p>

<p> Mid-level Distribution: Distributors further divide the
ounces of crack </p>

<p> into dosage units for sale at the retail level. If they
purchase cocaine </p>

<p> HCl, they can perform the conversion process easily
themselves. These </p>

<p> distributors often operate crack houses or manage
street-corner sales </p>

<p> locations and supervise up to 20 individual sellers.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors can be either members of larger groups or
independent </p>

<p> operators. </p>

<p> Retail-level Sales: Sellers carry dosage units of crack
totaling no more </p>

<p> than a few grams at any one time. Workers in crack houses
will sell </p>

<p> dosage units from the one or two ounces that are delivered by
the mid- </p>

<p> level distributors. Retailers are typically young males who
are </p>

<p> unemployed or destitute and many of them are crack addicts
themselves. </p>

<p> At the retail level, crack is sold by countless individual
sellers, </p>

<p> usually in inner-city sections of large metropolitan areas.
Upon arrest, </p>

<p> these retailers are almost immediately replaced. While crack
sellers and </p>

<p> users are present in virtually every ethnic community and
economic </p>

<p> group, the majority are from low-income, urban
African-American and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Networks </p>

<p> Over the past few years, crack trafficking has expanded from
the large </p>

<p> urban centers to smaller cities, towns, and rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States. Major crack trafficking groups, such as the
Crips, the </p>

<p> Bloods, and Jamaicans, are successfully extending their
networks from </p>

<p> large cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, and New
York City, </p>

<p> to street corners and dwellings in virtually every State
including </p>

<p> Alaska and Hawaii. This is occurring primarily for two
reasons. First, </p>

<p> these groups are attempting to enlarge their customer pools
and increase </p>

<p> their potential profits; second, the threat of disruption by
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure or aggressive competition has generated
the search </p>

<p> for less hostile environments. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are making advances away from the traditional
</p>

<p> strongholds of Miami and New York City, targeting new crack
markets. </p>

<p> Areas witnessing increased posse activity include Dallas and
Kansas </p>

<p> City; Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia; and the
Florida </p>

<p> Panhandle. Jamaican posses reportedly have been distributing
crack as </p>

<p> far westward as south-central Los Angeles. In a similar
manner, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods or their affiliates have been moving
eastward into </p>

<p> cities such as Birmingham, Denver, Detroit, Las Vegas, and
Phoenix, as </p>

<p> well as into West Coast cities such as Seattle. Recent
reports in the </p>

<p> media suggest that these gangs are also moving into New York
City. In </p>

<p> effect, posses and gangs have crisscrossed the nation with
crack- </p>

<p> trafficking networks. </p>

<p> When crack first became available in New York City, it was
sold by small </p>

<p> local bands of independent street sellers. Quite soon,
however, these </p>

<p> sellers were incorporated into the lowest level of large
organized </p>

<p> networks. The most successful groups increased their
membership by </p>

<p> adopting other gangs through strong-armed persuasion or
eliminated their </p>

<p> leadership altogether. As the groups grew larger, they
attracted more </p>

<p> law enforcement attention. In the late 1980's, New York
City's two </p>

<p> largest crack distribution organizations, Lido and Based
Balls, were </p>

<p> successfully dismantled by Federal, State, and local law
enforcement </p>

<p> agencies. </p>

<p> Currently, the larger groups in the United States are trying
to insulate </p>

<p> themselves from law enforcement detection by scaling down and
</p>

<p> streamlining their crack production and sales operations. The
tedious </p>

<p> and labor-intensive process of shaving off dosage unit size
rocks of </p>

<p> crack from larger chunks and packaging them in countless tiny
plastic </p>

<p> bags or vials in cumbersome factory style operations is ill
suited to </p>

<p> the clandestine nature of drug distribution. Recent
disruption of a </p>

<p> large number of organizations by law enforcement has created
a </p>

<p> distribution and sales system composed of many small groups
operating in </p>

<p> a limited number of neighborhoods. </p>

<p> Trafficking Groups </p>

<p> The major crack trafficking organizations consist of street
gangs, such </p>

<p> as the Crips and the Bloods, and groups of Jamaicans,
Haitians, and </p>

<p> Dominicans. They all use similar trafficking and distribution
techniques </p>

<p> and are engaged in interstate and intrastate transportation
of wholesale </p>

<p> amounts of crack and cocaine HCl. They also have the
knowledge, </p>

<p> experience, drug connections, manpower, and firepower to ply
their trade </p>

<p> over long distances. </p>

<p> The majority of the information contained in this section was
obtained </p>

<p> from the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law
Enforcement </p>

<p> Network Fifth Annual Conferences on International Caribbean
Organized </p>

<p> Crime held June 15-19, 1992, and June 29 through July 2,
1993, in </p>

<p> Baltimore. </p>

<p> Jamaicans: One of the most effective crack trafficking groups
in the </p>

<p> United States is the Jamaican posse. Posses consist of gangs
of Jamaican </p>

<p> immigrants, often illegal aliens, that are involved in many
criminal </p>

<p> activities other than drug trafficking, including robbery,
fraud, and </p>

<p> money laundering. From these activities, posses receive an
estimated one </p>

<p> billion dollars annually drug proceeds. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) estimates
that, </p>

<p> currently, there are approximately 35 posses operating in the
United </p>

<p> States with total membership numbering at least 11,000. Most
posses </p>

<p> maintain some type of link to the larger, more established
groups or </p>

<p> parent posses in New York City or Miami, such as the Shower,
Spangler, </p>

<p> Dunkirk, and Jungle posses. New York City is generally
considered to be </p>

<p> the hub of Jamaican posse activity. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are extremely violent, competitive, and
individualistic. </p>

<p> As a result, the structure of Jamaican organized crime will
remain </p>

<p> fragmented, lacking disciplined organizations and alliances
which are </p>

<p> common characteristics of traditional organized crime. Also,
successful </p>

<p> prosecution by Federal authorities over the past several
years has </p>

<p> disrupted much of the organization and control of the most
prominent </p>

<p> posses that operated nationwide. As a result of these
factors, a large </p>

<p> number of newly named splinter groups have evolved under the
direction </p>

<p> of new posse bosses. </p>

<p> Jamaican posses are attempting to insulate themselves from
law </p>

<p> enforcement pressure and violent competition by distancing
themselves </p>

<p> from the often dangerous day-to-day operation of crack houses
and by </p>

<p> distributing larger amounts of cocaine, in effect simply
supplying those </p>

<p> same crack houses and street level distribution sites.
Jamaicans are </p>

<p> also initiating alliances with members of other ethnic drug
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. For example, Jamaicans have been attempting to
establish </p>

<p> connections with Colombian and Mexican wholesale suppliers of
cocaine in </p>

<p> order to eliminate middlemen and related additional costs.
Also, </p>

<p> Jamaicans have been employing other minorities such as
Haitians because </p>

<p> they are willing to work for less in the lower levels of the </p>

<p> distribution chain. </p>

<p> Jamaicans also are distributing other illegal drugs such as
heroin and </p>

<p> marijuana; a few have been able to realize higher profits
from heroin </p>

<p> distribution. Moreover, some Jamaicans have returned to
trafficking </p>

<p> marijuana because the Federal penalties for marijuana
trafficking are </p>

<p> less severe than those for crack and cocaine HCl, yet the
profit </p>

<p> potential is almost as high. </p>

<p> A common method of operation by Jamaican posses is termed
&quot;drip&quot; </p>

<p> trafficking. In an attempt to escape law enforcement efforts
and to </p>

<p> protect against seizure, loss, or theft by competitors,
Jamaican posses </p>

<p> do not stockpile large amounts of drugs and money; rather,
they move </p>

<p> smaller quantities more often and more quickly. </p>

<p> In their efforts to expand crack sales and increase profits,
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses are branching out to other cities and rural areas to
establish </p>

<p> new drug markets where competition from rival gangs and law
enforcement </p>

<p> activity is lessened. This migration has been observed in
Dallas, </p>

<p> Denver, Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and northern Florida. </p>

<p> The Southwest border area has seen a significant influx of
Jamaican </p>

<p> traffickers during the last five years because cocaine HCl
and marijuana </p>

<p> are much cheaper to purchase in that region of the country.
As a result, </p>

<p> they have set up storefronts, usually garages, hair salons,
or music </p>

<p> stores, to mask distribution outlets and to launder proceeds.
Since </p>

<p> weapons can be purchased for less in Texas than in other
southern </p>

<p> States, Jamaicans often use females to make straw purchases
of guns </p>

<p> which are then sent to New York and other cities in the
Northeast. </p>

<p> Drugs, proceeds, and weapons are all shipped to different
locations </p>

<p> using a variety of means. Commercial airlines have proven to
be an </p>

<p> effective method of transportation. When interdiction efforts
at </p>

<p> particular airports become prohibitive, couriers drive to
airports in </p>

<p> other cities to elude law enforcement. Buses, trains, and
rental </p>

<p> vehicles are also popular methods of shipment. False
compartments are </p>

<p> frequently built into vehicles for transportation of drugs,
money, and </p>

<p> weapons. Additionally, mail services such as United Parcel
Service and </p>

<p> Federal Express are used to ship drugs and profits for the
Jamaican </p>

<p> posses. </p>

<p> Dominicans: While some official estimates of the number of
Dominicans </p>

<p> living in New York City are as low as 350,000, ATF claims the
actual </p>

<p> number, including illegal aliens, may be closer to 1,000,000.
</p>

<p> The hierarchy of Dominican gangs is slightly different than
that of the </p>

<p> Jamaicans in that the Dominican bosses usually run their
networks from </p>

<p> the Dominican Republic directly, traveling to and from the
United States </p>

<p> as needed. Dominican gangs are always armed and employ modern
equipment </p>

<p> and techniques in their daily operations, including
walkie-talkies, </p>

<p> &quot;kel&quot; transmitting devices, booby traps (to protect
drugs and money from </p>

<p> police action as well as from theft by competitors), and use
of counter- </p>

<p> surveillance, which they practiced in the Dominican Republic
in order to </p>

<p> elude the police. </p>

<p> Like the Jamaican posses, the Dominican traffickers are very
violent and </p>

<p> competitive and, as a result, do not easily form tightly
structured and </p>

<p> disciplined organizations. Although some reports suggest the
emergence </p>

<p> of a Dominican drug cartel, no evidence has been brought
forth to verify </p>

<p> the existence of an organization capable of orchestrating
large-scale </p>

<p> importation and trafficking activities. However, this
eventuality should </p>

<p> not be dismissed because, since the early 1980's, the
Dominican Republic </p>

<p> has been used by Colombians as a refueling and transshipment
point for </p>

<p> drugs destined for the United States and cooperation between
Colombian </p>

<p> and Dominican traffickers has flourished. </p>

<p> Dominicans have made gains in establishing money-laundering
operations </p>

<p> and front companies, most commonly travel agencies and check
cashing </p>

<p> businesses. At times, they purchase businesses outright or
make deals </p>

<p> with the owners or proprietors to carry out their orders. It
is not </p>

<p> known to what extent drug proceeds are sent directly to the
Dominican </p>

<p> Republic. Overall money transfers are estimated to be
approximately $800 </p>

<p> million per year. </p>

<p> Haitians: Haitian drug traffickers in the United States have
been able </p>

<p> to strengthen their status in the drug trade through two
significant </p>

<p> events. First, an influx of Haitian immigrants since the
early 1970's </p>

<p> has provided a large pool of recruits for the drug trade.
Second, by the </p>

<p> late 1980's, Haiti had become an important way station for
cocaine HCl </p>

<p> shipped into the United States by the Colombian cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Haitian crack traffickers operate in a limited
number of </p>

<p> major cities, primarily Miami and New York, and have not
extended their </p>

<p> operations as the Jamaicans have. Many Haitian sellers are
moving their </p>

<p> way up the distribution hierarchy by working at the lower
levels of </p>

<p> crack operations run by other ethnic groups. </p>

<p> Street Gangs: Street gangs, operating under the umbrella
names of the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods, extended their networks from the
streets of Los </p>

<p> Angeles to many major American cities in the last half of the
1980's. </p>

<p> Sales of crack and cocaine HCl brought them power and
influence during </p>

<p> that time. Gang members learned quickly that the cheap
cocaine available </p>

<p> in Los Angeles could be sold as cocaine HCl or crack at great
profit in </p>

<p> other parts of the country. </p>

<p> Los Angeles street gangs are very loosely organized in small
units or </p>

<p> &quot;sets&quot; falling under the auspices of the two
predominant gangs, the </p>

<p> Crips and the Bloods. The general street gang structure
begins with </p>

<p> diverse groups of gang members acting as street-level sellers
conducting </p>

<p> transactions in amounts up to several grams or even ounces on
the street </p>

<p> or in rock houses. A few of these sellers rise to become
mid-level </p>

<p> distributors, dealing in amounts of up to one kilogram or
more and </p>

<p> working between the street-level sellers and the major
traffickers. </p>

<p> Capable of brokering multimillion dollar deals, the major
traffickers, </p>

<p> often referred to as &quot;high rollers,&quot; are not
usually visible gang </p>

<p> members and often have direct contacts with Colombian
wholesale cocaine </p>

<p> suppliers. </p>

<p> Initially, gangs sold marijuana and PCP prior to entering
into cocaine </p>

<p> HCl and crack trafficking, distribution, and sales.
Eventually, they </p>

<p> developed a mode of operation that closely resembles the
Jamaican model. </p>

<p> Typically, gang members travel to and establish crack
operations in </p>

<p> smaller cities and towns where there is little police
pressure and </p>

<p> competition from rivals. They often gain entry into a
community by </p>

<p> visiting or living with friends or relatives. In addition to
securing </p>

<p> lodgings, these visits provide access to young people,
potential </p>

<p> recruits and customers, and help them attain legitimacy and
acceptance </p>

<p> within the community. Soon, the gang members will seek out in
many </p>

<p> instances low-income single mothers and offer them $100 a day
to use </p>

<p> their apartment or house as a crack conversion or
distribution site. A </p>

<p> common marketing technique known as &quot;double up&quot; is
used by these street </p>

<p> gangs to attract new customers and involves the sale of two
dosage units </p>

<p> of crack for the price of one. </p>

<p> Sales Locations </p>

<p> With few exceptions, crack distribution takes place either in
urban or </p>

<p> suburban dwellings of all types or at inner-city street
corner </p>

<p> locations. Virtually every large city in America has seen the
emergence </p>

<p> of both of these retail sales locations. The prevalence of
one site over </p>

<p> the other may be directly linked to two factors. </p>

<p> First, weather plays a major role in determining the chosen
method of </p>

<p> crack distribution. For example, in cities with cold winters,
sellers </p>

<p> will set up crack houses to escape the elements themselves
and to offer </p>

<p> customers more hospitable accommodations. In summer, the
operation may </p>

<p> be moved outdoors where increased pedestrian traffic provides
the </p>

<p> necessary cover for street corner sales. </p>

<p> Second, the presence of significant law enforcement activity
may force </p>

<p> street corner retailers to set up indoor crack facilities to
evade </p>

<p> detection. Conversely, if gangs are suffering substantial
losses due to </p>

<p> police raids on established crack houses, they may dispatch
sellers to </p>

<p> specific, pre-designated street corner sales locations. </p>

<p> The sale of crack at street corner locations is considered to
be ideal </p>

<p> because it provides sellers many avenues of escape when faced
with </p>

<p> police pressure. If a particular street becomes too
&quot;hot&quot; with police </p>

<p> activity, the retailers merely move a few blocks away and
continue </p>

<p> selling. Moreover, tactics can be employed to mask street
corner sales </p>

<p> of crack. In New York City, crack distributors have been
known to </p>

<p> dispatch a seller along with up to 10 people dressed exactly
alike to </p>

<p> work a street corner in an attempt to disrupt surveillance
efforts. In </p>

<p> addition, street corner operations do not require
expenditures for rent </p>

<p> and utilities, as is the case with crack houses. </p>

<p> HEROIN </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Within the United States, heroin is readily available in all
major </p>

<p> metropolitan areas having user populations. During 1992 and
the first </p>

<p> few months of 1993, there was an increase in purity
nationwide at the </p>

<p> retail level and increased supplies available from Southwest
Asia. (It </p>

<p> should be noted that high purity heroin has been imported
from Colombia </p>

<p> in increasing quantities in the past year. This heroin from
Colombia, </p>

<p> which underwent signature analysis prior to DEA's development
of a South </p>

<p> American heroin signature in July 1993, was analyzed as
having a </p>

<p> Southwest Asian (SWA) signature. As a result, it may account
in part for </p>

<p> both the increased purity and quantity of SWA heroin in the
United </p>

<p> States.) At present, street-level purity, the key indicator
of </p>

<p> availability, is at high levels, particularly in the
northeastern </p>

<p> metropolitan areas. </p>

<p> Heroin from every major source area is available in the
United States, </p>

<p> which is the most lucrative wholesale and retail level heroin
market in </p>

<p> the world. The origin of heroin smuggled into the United
States and the </p>

<p> proportion from each source area is tracked by DEA's Heroin
Signature </p>

<p> Program (HSP). Each year an in-depth chemical analysis is
performed on </p>

<p> 600 to 800 samples taken from heroin seizures and purchases
made in the </p>

<p> United States. The samples selected for signature analysis
include all </p>

<p> DEA seizures at U.S. points of entry and other
seizures/purchases </p>

<p> selected at random from DEA, in addition to Federal Bureau of
</p>

<p> Investigation, and U.S. Customs Service seizures and
purchases. As a </p>

<p> result of signature analysis, DEA chemists are able to
associate the </p>

<p> heroin sample with a heroin manufacturing process unique to a
particular </p>

<p> geographic source area. The proportion of samples associated
with each </p>

<p> geographic area is measured both in terms of the number of
samples from </p>

<p> each geographic source area and, since 1989, the net weight
of the </p>

<p> heroin samples from each area. </p>

<p> In 1991, Southeast Asia (SEA) was the prevalent source area
for heroin </p>

<p> in the United States for the fourth year in a row, accounting
for 58 </p>

<p> percent of the heroin samples analyzed through the HSP. SWA
heroin and </p>

<p> Mexican source heroin accounted for half of the remaining
samples with </p>

<p> 21 percent apiece. In 1992, the results of the HSP were
skewed by the </p>

<p> introduction of a number of samples of purported Colombian
heroin. </p>

<p> Because a specific signature for heroin from Colombia was not
available </p>

<p> then, most heroin samples of alleged Colombian origin are
analyzed as </p>

<p> having a Southwest Asian signature. With this in mind,
preliminary HSP </p>

<p> figures for 1992 reflect that 44 percent of the heroin
samples analyzed </p>

<p> were from Southeast Asia, 39 percent from Southwest Asia or
Colombia, </p>

<p> and the remaining 17 percent from Mexico. </p>

<p> Signature analysis also reveals that SEA heroin accounted for
88 percent </p>

<p> of the total net weight of the heroin samples analyzed in
1991, and 58 </p>

<p> percent in 1992. SWA heroin (including heroin from Colombia)
accounted </p>

<p> for nine and 32 percent of the total net weight of the heroin
samples </p>

<p> analyzed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Mexican heroin
accounted for </p>

<p> three percent of the total net weight in 1991 and 10 percent
in 1992. </p>

<p> U.S. airports, particularly New York's JFK International
Airport, are </p>

<p> primary entry points for heroin shipments destined for the
U.S. market. </p>

<p> The HSP shows that 91 percent (454 out of 498) of the heroin
seizures </p>

<p> that took place at the U.S. border and points of entry during
1992 </p>

<p> occurred at airports, and that over 75 percent of the airport
seizures </p>

<p> occurred at New York's JFK International Airport. The
nationwide average </p>

<p> net weight airport seizure was almost 800 grams and the
average purity </p>

<p> of the heroin seized at these airports was 73 percent. </p>

<p> Nationally, in 1992, a kilogram of SEA heroin sold for
$90,000 to </p>

<p> $250,000. In the northeastern United States, SEA heroin is
also commonly </p>

<p> sold in units (700 grams), which sell for $90,000 to
$115,000. The price </p>

<p> for SWA heroin ranged from $80,000 to $200,000 per kilogram.
Wholesale </p>

<p> level prices for Mexican heroin were the lowest of any type
of heroin </p>

<p> and ranged from $50,000 to $150,000. The wide range in the
price of a </p>

<p> kilogram reflects several variables including buyer/seller
relationship, </p>

<p> quantity purchased, purchase frequency, purity, and
transportation </p>

<p> costs. Numerous and diverse foreign sources of supply also
account for </p>

<p> the wide variances. </p>

<p> At the mid-level of the traffic, where dealers sell
quantities ranging </p>

<p> from an ounce to multiounces, SEA heroin and SWA heroin sold
for $5,500 </p>

<p> to $12,000 per ounce. Mexican black tar heroin sold for
between $1,800 </p>

<p> and $4,000 per ounce, and Mexican brown powder heroin prices
ranged from </p>

<p> $ 1,000 to $ 1,800 per ounce. </p>

<p> Domestic prices for Colombian-source heroin are generally
compatible </p>

<p> with the prices for heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia.
Kilogram </p>

<p> prices quoted in undercover negotiations range up to $150,000
and vary </p>

<p> depending on final point of delivery. In actual undercover
purchases of </p>

<p> smaller amounts, one-eighth of a kilogram cost $23,500,
one-fourth of a </p>

<p> kilogram cost $42,500, and one-half kilogram sold for
$62,250. </p>

<p> Heroin is sold at the retail level in the United States at
prices </p>

<p> ranging from $10 to $50 and in quantities ranging from 10 to
50 </p>

<p> milligrams. The retail price remains relatively constant at
this level </p>

<p> because retail-level purity, rather than retail-level price,
is adjusted </p>

<p> by the distributors to account for availability and to
manipulate profit </p>

<p> margins. </p>

<p> The HSP provides purity information on heroin shipments
smuggled into </p>

<p> the United States at the importation, or wholesale, level.
For all types </p>

<p> of heroin at this level, the nationwide average purity in
1992 was 64 </p>

<p> percent. SWA heroin was the purest form available at the
wholesale </p>

<p> level, averaging 72 percent. SEA heroin nationwide averaged
slightly </p>

<p> lower at 68 percent, while Mexican heroin averaged 33
percent. </p>

<p> At the retail level, purity is tracked by DEA's Domestic
Monitor Program </p>

<p> (DMP), a heroin purchase program designed to provide price,
purity, and </p>

<p> geographic source area data on heroin being distributed on
the streets </p>

<p> of U.S. cities. The program is conducted quarterly in one
city from each </p>

<p> of DEA's 19 field divisions and San Juan, Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> According to DMP data for 1992, the nationwide average purity
for retail </p>

<p> level heroin was 37 percent. This percentage was much higher
than the </p>

<p> average of 6.9 percent recorded a decade ago and also
considerably </p>

<p> higher than the average purity of 26.6 percent recorded in
1991. The </p>

<p> increase in average purity corresponded directly to an
increase in </p>

<p> availability of high purity SEA and SWA heroin. Although
Mexican heroin </p>

<p> has been traditionally of lower purity than other heroin
types in recent </p>

<p> years, it too increased in purity at the street level.
Street-level </p>

<p> purity of SWA heroin analyzed in the DMP during 1992 was the
highest for </p>

<p> all sources, averaging 55.8 percent, while Mexican heroin, at
25.6 </p>

<p> percent, almost doubled between 1991 and 1992. SEA heroin
remained </p>

<p> widely available in the northeastern United States with an
average </p>

<p> purity of 34.4 percent. </p>

<p> Heroin purity at the street level was generally highest in
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States, where a large percentage of the
nation's </p>

<p> user population lives. In New York City, one of the major
importation </p>

<p> and distribution centers for SEA and SWA heroin, the average
purity at </p>

<p> the street level for these types of heroin was, respectively,
54.3 </p>

<p> percent and 69.7 percent. Boston recorded the highest average
purity of </p>

<p> retail level heroin in all of the DMP cities with an average
of 73.7 </p>

<p> percent during 1992. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1992
indicated a </p>

<p> decrease in the number of past-year heroin users. Survey data
show that </p>

<p> the number of Americans 12 years of age or older who have
used heroin at </p>

<p> least once in the past year declined from 381,000 in 1991 to
323,000 in </p>

<p> 1992. During that same time frame, however, the number of
past-month </p>

<p> heroin users increased from 83,000 to 107,000. The increase
in the </p>

<p> number of lifetime heroin users to 2,653,000 in 1991 appears
to have </p>

<p> been an anomaly, as the 1992 estimate has declined to
1,840,000. </p>

<p> (Estimates of heroin use from the Household Survey are
considered very </p>

<p> conservative due to the probable under coverage of the
population of </p>

<p> heroin users.) </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> heroin use increased among high school seniors. Although 1.2
percent of </p>

<p> the seniors in the class of 1992 reported they had used
heroin at least </p>

<p> once in their lifetime, up from 0.9 percent in the class of
1991, it was </p>

<p> still below the peak of 1.3 percent reported in the classes
of 1989 and </p>

<p> 1990. Moreover, for the first time in recent years, there was
a </p>

<p> statistically significant decline among seniors in the
perceived risk of </p>

<p> harm associated with heroin use. </p>

<p> The National High School Survey also shows that lifetime
heroin use </p>

<p> among 8th graders increased from 1.2 percent in 1991 to 1.4
percent in </p>

<p> 1992, past year use remained steady, and past-month use
increased from a </p>

<p> 0.3 percent in 1991 to 0.4 percent in 1992. Among 10th
graders, both </p>

<p> lifetime and past-month use remained stable from 1991 to
1992, while </p>

<p> past-year heroin use increased form 0.5 percent to 0.6
percent. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
nationwide </p>

<p> heroin-related emergency room episodes, which had been
fluctuating </p>

<p> somewhat during the past several years, increased
substantially from the </p>

<p> first to second half of FY 1992. During that time frame, the
number of </p>

<p> heroin-related episodes rose from 18,192 to 24,593, an
increase of 35 </p>

<p> percent. Cities showing substantive increases during the
latter half of </p>

<p> FY 1992 in the number of heroin-related emergency room
episodes included </p>

<p> Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, and Seattle. </p>

<p> Possible explanations for the rising levels of heroin-related
emergency </p>

<p> room episodes have been provided by a number of drug
epidemiologists and </p>

<p> treatment specialists. Reports indicate that segments of the
crack </p>

<p> cocaine user population are using or switching to heroin as a
means to </p>

<p> mitigate the depressive effects associated with withdrawal
from crack. </p>

<p> There are additional reports of the appearance, in a limited
number of </p>

<p> areas, of new distributors attempting to establish markets as
well as </p>

<p> the growing involvement of youth gangs in the heroin traffic.
Moreover, </p>

<p> heroin is now being sold in white as well as African-American
and </p>

<p> Hispanic neighborhoods in a limited number of cities. In New
York City, </p>

<p> anecdotal information indicates that more teenagers and
females are </p>

<p> selling heroin than in the past. Lastly, there is a
perception among </p>

<p> some users that heroin is a safer drug than cocaine, while
certain </p>

<p> others consider heroin use to be &quot;cool.&quot; The latter
represents a radical </p>

<p> departure from previous attitudes toward heroin use. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
heroin </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for heroin-related problems.
However, </p>

<p> the percentage of patients who indicated that injection was
their </p>

<p> primary route of administration has decreased from 79.1
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1989 to 73.9 percent in FY 1992. During this same time frame,
there was </p>

<p> an increase in the percentage of patients who snorted heroin.
Those who </p>

<p> snorted heroin rose from 4.8 percent in FY 1989 to 8.8
percent in FY </p>

<p> 1992. Increases in snorting are attributed, in part, to a
fear of </p>

<p> contracting AIDS through needle sharing and the availability
of high- </p>

<p> purity heroin on the street. </p>

<p> Opiate use (to include heroin) among recently booked
arrestees as </p>

<p> reported by the DUF Program remained relatively low and
stable in 1992 </p>

<p> when compared to rates for cocaine and marijuana. Cities
having the </p>

<p> highest percentage of positive urinalysis tests for heroin
among booked </p>

<p> male arrestees in the first half of 1992 were Chicago at 19
percent; New </p>

<p> York City at 18 percent; San Antonio at 15 percent; San Diego
at 16 </p>

<p> percent; Washington, D.C., at 11 percent; Los Angeles at 11
percent; and </p>

<p> Philadelphia at 12 percent. Female arrestees tested positive
at high </p>

<p> rates in New York City (24%), Portland (22%), Washington,
D.C., (19%), </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> SEA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Major SEA heroin trafficking organizations, often under the
control of </p>

<p> Sino-Thai and Chinese criminal groups, oversee the smuggling
of SEA </p>

<p> heroin into the United States. Chinese traffickers in the
United States </p>

<p> with links to these international criminal groups are the
most prolific </p>

<p> importers and distributors of heroin from Southeast Asia.
Chinese or </p>

<p> Thai nationals are often used to transport the heroin and are
generally </p>

<p> responsible for the largest bulk shipments, in the
multihundred kilogram </p>

<p> range, of SEA heroin smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> Around 1986, these Chinese smuggling groups took over the
multibillion </p>

<p> dollar wholesale heroin trade that had been controlled for
over two </p>

<p> decades by Traditional Organized Crime groups in the United
States. Over </p>

<p> the next few years, ethnic Chinese traffickers flooded the
northeastern </p>

<p> United States, the largest heroin market in the country, with
bulk </p>

<p> shipments of high-purity SEA heroin. In recent years, these
highly </p>

<p> structured clandestine Chinese organizations have increased
the size and </p>

<p> number of heroin shipments to the United States. In the wake
of </p>

<p> increased availability, the layers of mid-level distributors
in the New </p>

<p> York City area were eliminated and Chinese wholesalers sold
directly to </p>

<p> Dominican street-level dealers, a development that resulted
in enhanced </p>

<p> heroin purity at the street level. </p>

<p> SEA heroin traffickers use a variety of transportation routes
to smuggle </p>

<p> heroin into the United States from the Far East. One of the
major routes </p>

<p> originates in Bangkok and terminates in New York City, the
largest </p>

<p> heroin importation and distribution center in the United
States. (Each </p>

<p> year since 1986, roughly half of DEA's nationwide seizures
occur in the </p>

<p> New York City metropolitan area.) Maritime cargo shipments
are the </p>

<p> primary transport method for smugglers using this route and
the </p>

<p> shipments may transit a variety of countries including Hong
Kong, Japan, </p>

<p> Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan. Many shipments
from the </p>

<p> Far East are also transshipped through Canada and then into
the </p>

<p> northeastern United States. Traffickers smuggle heroin
shipments aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines originating in Bangkok and then transit
almost any </p>

<p> Asian city, as well as a number of cities in Europe and
Canada. In </p>

<p> addition to New York City, other U.S. cities in the
Northeast, including </p>

<p> Boston and Philadelphia, are also used as entry points.
Traffickers also </p>

<p> use West Coast cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and
Seattle as </p>

<p> entry points for heroin shipments destined for the Northeast.
</p>

<p> Chinese traffickers employ a variety of smuggling methods.
Generally, </p>

<p> the size of the heroin shipment determines the smuggling
method. The </p>

<p> largest shipments, ranging from 50- to multihundred-kilogram
quantities, </p>

<p> are secreted in containerized freight aboard commercial
marine vessels </p>

<p> and air freight cargo. Smaller shipments are concealed in the
luggage of </p>

<p> airline passengers, strapped to the body, or swallowed. SEA
heroin </p>

<p> smugglers also use the mails and delivery services to
transport </p>

<p> multigram to kilogram quantities into the country. </p>

<p> Traffickers using commercial cargo originating in source
countries </p>

<p> frequently attempt to disguise the origin of the cargo
shipment by first </p>

<p> transshipping containers through several other countries or
by </p>

<p> falsifying the container documentation. In 1992, 35 kilograms
of heroin, </p>

<p> which were shipped from Singapore concealed in ceramic tiles,
were </p>

<p> seized in Newark, New Jersey. In May 1991, the largest heroin
seizure in </p>

<p> U.S. history occurred near Oakland, California, when 494
kilograms of </p>

<p> SEA heroin were seized from a commercial cargo of plastic
bags aboard a </p>

<p> merchant vessel. The shipment originated in Thailand and was </p>

<p> transshipped through Taiwan prior to importation into the
United States. </p>

<p> In addition to the Chinese and Sino-Thai traffickers,
Nigerians remain </p>

<p> deeply entrenched in the smuggling of SEA heroin. Nigerian
traffickers </p>

<p> dispatch large numbers of internal body couriers traveling
aboard </p>

<p> commercial airlines bound for the United States. These
&quot;swallowers,&quot; </p>

<p> including Nigerians as well as other nationalities recruited
as </p>

<p> couriers, can smuggle up to two-kilogram amounts of SEA
heroin per trip. </p>

<p> Moreover, recent reporting suggests that a number of Nigerian
</p>

<p> trafficking groups are experimenting with smuggling larger </p>

<p> (multikilogram) shipments of heroin concealed in commercial
maritime </p>

<p> cargo. </p>

<p> Most Nigerian organizations are based in Lagos, Nigeria.
Since they are </p>

<p> formed along tribal lines at the senior levels, the
organizations are </p>

<p> close-knit. Drug barons who control the Nigerian
organizations remain </p>

<p> well-insulated by directing lower-level traffickers to
recruit the </p>

<p> numerous couriers, often non-Nigerians, and to organize
travel to the </p>

<p> United States. In 1992, Nigerians returned almost all profits
generated </p>

<p> in the United States to Lagos, Nigeria, or to Europe for
laundering. </p>

<p> As a result of enforcement pressure, Nigerians continue to
recruit other </p>

<p> ethnic groups, including other West Africans, Europeans, and
American </p>

<p> citizens, as heroin couriers. New York's JFK International
Airport was </p>

<p> the entry point used most frequently by Nigerian trafficking </p>

<p> organizations in 1992. However, during the past year,
Nigerian </p>

<p> traffickers diversified both the smuggling routes used to
reach the </p>

<p> United States and their points of entry into the country. For
example, </p>

<p> West Africans, in all likelihood controlled by Nigerians,
made a limited </p>

<p> number of attempts to smuggle heroin through entry points
along the </p>

<p> United States Southwest border and the Canadian border during
1992. </p>

<p> Nigerians have established heroin distribution networks in
U.S. cities </p>

<p> with well-established Nigerian populations such as Atlanta,
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Newark, New York, and Washington,
D.C. These </p>

<p> networks are capable of supplying heroin ranging from
100-gram to </p>

<p> multikilogram quantities on a regular basis. During 1992,
reporting from </p>

<p> a DEA investigation in Dallas indicated that Nigerian heroin
traffickers </p>

<p> collaborated with members of Jamaican posses in distributing
heroin from </p>

<p> Jamaican-controlled crack houses in Dallas and hired posse
members as </p>

<p> enforcers to protect Nigerian operations. </p>

<p> SWA Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> SWA heroin in the United States increased in availability and
purity </p>

<p> during 1992 and the first few months of 1993. While some of
the rise in </p>

<p> purity levels for SWA heroin is in all likelihood
attributable to the </p>

<p> influx of high-purity heroin from Colombia, investigative
reporting and </p>

<p> laboratory analysis show that traditional SWA heroin
traffickers are </p>

<p> also smuggling a purer form of heroin into the United States.
</p>

<p> Importation and distribution of SWA heroin is much less
centralized than </p>

<p> that for SEA heroin, both geographically and in regard to
trafficking </p>

<p> groups. A number of ethnic groups from Southwest Asia, the
Middle East, </p>

<p> and Europe are active in smuggling SWA heroin into the United
States, </p>

<p> and its distribution; these ethnic groups include Afghans,
Greeks, </p>

<p> Iranians, Israelis, Lebanese, Pakistanis, and Turks. SWA
heroin is </p>

<p> transported to the United States directly from producing
countries, as </p>

<p> well as transshipped through Europe and Africa. Significant
quantities </p>

<p> of SWA heroin bound for the United States are also
transshipped through </p>

<p> the Canadian cities of Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver.
Although New </p>

<p> York City is a major SWA heroin importation and distribution
center, </p>

<p> heroin is also smuggled into and distributed throughout the
Northeast; </p>

<p> in Mid-Atlantic cities such as Baltimore and Washington,
D.C.; in some </p>

<p> cities on the West Coast such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and
San </p>

<p> Francisco; in some Midwestern cities including Chicago and
Detroit; and </p>

<p> in Puerto Rico. Other points of entry for SWA heroin include
Houston and </p>

<p> Miami. </p>

<p> Most SWA heroin trafficking groups in the United States are
highly </p>

<p> cohesive and difficult to penetrate because they are based on
ethnic, </p>

<p> familial, and tribal relationships. SWA heroin importers and
wholesale </p>

<p> level distributors generally are very cautious and rarely
transact with </p>

<p> outsiders. As a result, SWA heroin trafficking and
distribution are </p>

<p> generally more prevalent in cities that have large
populations from </p>

<p> Afghanistan, Greece, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Turkey, such as
Chicago, </p>

<p> Detroit, and New York City. </p>

<p> SWA heroin traffickers rely less on commercial cargo as a
smuggling </p>

<p> method than their counterparts from Southeast Asia.
Generally, SWA </p>

<p> heroin traffickers, unlike Chinese traffickers, do not
smuggle heroin on </p>

<p> a large scale, such as multiple bulk shipments. However, they
are able </p>

<p> to regularly smuggle shipments ranging from one to 20
kilograms and, on </p>

<p> occasion, larger amounts. Many SWA heroin trafficking
organizations use </p>

<p> commercial cargo and couriers aboard commercial airlines to
smuggle one </p>

<p> to five kilograms on a steady basis. However, several
organizations are </p>

<p> capable of smuggling from five- to 10 kilogram shipments
aboard maritime </p>

<p> vessels on a fairly regular basis. </p>

<p> Pakistani traffickers, who smuggle SWA heroin, control
importation </p>

<p> routes into the United States and distribution networks in
New York City </p>

<p> and other cities in the East and Midwest. This heroin is
occasionally </p>

<p> transshipped through California as well. Pakistani
traffickers are adept </p>

<p> at developing new smuggling techniques and unique concealment
methods, </p>

<p> such as specially designed vests with pockets to conceal
heroin, which </p>

<p> are worn underneath the clothes of couriers on airlines. </p>

<p> Pakistanis regularly transact business with Afghan and Indian
</p>

<p> traffickers, and other ethnic groups from Southwest and South
Asia. Some </p>

<p> Nigerians still smuggle and distribute SWA heroin but most
are now more </p>

<p> active in trafficking SEA heroin. </p>

<p> Lebanese trafficking groups appear to be increasing their
level of </p>

<p> smuggling into and distribution in the United States,
particularly in </p>

<p> Boston, Detroit, and New York, cities with large Lebanese
communities. </p>

<p> Moreover, some SWA heroin originally destined for the
European market is </p>

<p> now smuggled into the United States because Lebanese
traffickers, in an </p>

<p> effort to maximize profit margins, are exchanging SWA heroin
for cocaine </p>

<p> with Colombian cocaine organizations. (At the wholesale
level, heroin </p>

<p> prices in the United States are higher than in Europe, while
cocaine </p>

<p> prices in Europe are higher than in the United States.) </p>

<p> Mexican Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> Mexican heroin, in brown powder form as well as the more
widely </p>

<p> available black tar form, is produced almost exclusively for
the U.S. </p>

<p> heroin market. The smuggling and distribution of Mexican
heroin to and </p>

<p> within the United States is controlled by organizations
composed of </p>

<p> Mexican nationals and Mexican-Americans. Mexican trafficking </p>

<p> organizations are often made up of family members, lifelong
friends, and </p>

<p> other trusted associates. </p>

<p> While some Mexican organizations control the entire process
from opium </p>

<p> production and heroin processing in Mexico to the management
of </p>

<p> transportation and distribution networks in the United
States, other </p>

<p> trafficking organizations operate independently on a smaller
scale. </p>

<p> Mexico's extensive land border with the United States
provides smugglers </p>

<p> numerous entry points into the country. Heroin is smuggled
across the </p>

<p> U.S. Southwest border in relatively small amounts, most often
ranging </p>

<p> from gram- to multiounce quantities, by large numbers of
illegal </p>

<p> immigrants and migrant workers. Occasionally, there are large
seizures, </p>

<p> such as the April 1993 seizure of approximately 10 kilograms
of black </p>

<p> tar heroin at Blythe, California, but such amounts are the
exception. </p>

<p> Generally, Mexican heroin seizures do not exceed one or two
kilograms. </p>

<p> The use of numerous couriers to smuggle relatively small
quantities of </p>

<p> Mexican heroin is characteristic of the smuggling methods
employed by </p>

<p> Mexican heroin traffickers. These traffickers take advantage
of their </p>

<p> close proximity to the United States by stockpiling the
larger </p>

<p> quantities of heroin in Mexico and then smuggling smaller
amounts as </p>

<p> transactions in the United States are arranged. Most
traffickers believe </p>

<p> their heroin stockpiles are less susceptible to law
enforcement in </p>

<p> Mexico, and by storing heroin there they minimize the danger
of U.S. </p>

<p> authorities seizing significant amounts of heroin. According
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting, even large poly-drug Mexican
organizations, </p>

<p> which are capable of smuggling multiton quantities of cocaine
and </p>

<p> marijuana, limit smuggling of Mexican heroin into the United
States to </p>

<p> kilogram and smaller amounts. </p>

<p> Traffickers who distribute Mexican heroin within the United
States are </p>

<p> generally Mexican immigrants, primarily from the States of
Durango, </p>

<p> Michoacan, Nuevo Leon, and Sinaloa. Mexican organizations
control </p>

<p> distribution at the wholesale level but are not generally
involved in </p>

<p> street sales which are often managed by local gangs. </p>

<p> Smuggling methods include concealment in motor vehicles,
public </p>

<p> transportation vehicles, internal and external body carry,
and </p>

<p> commercial package express services. Females are used much
more </p>

<p> frequently than males as couriers for transporting heroin and
money </p>

<p> across the border. </p>

<p> Once the heroin is smuggled into the United States,
transportation is </p>

<p> arranged to metropolitan areas in the western and
southwestern States </p>

<p> where there are sizable populations of Mexican immigrants.
Heroin is </p>

<p> also transported to the Chicago, Denver, and St. Louis
metropolitan </p>

<p> areas, primary markets for Mexican heroin. In the United
States, Mexican </p>

<p> black tar heroin is usually sold by the &quot;piece&quot; or
Mexican ounce, which </p>

<p> weighs 25 grams. </p>

<p> Colombian Heroin Trafficking </p>

<p> The availability of heroin from Colombia increased in the
United States </p>

<p> during the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, according to
seizure </p>

<p> analysis and investigative reporting. While most evidence
suggests that </p>

<p> Colombian traffickers are still operating at a fairly low
level, the </p>

<p> potential of the Colombian heroin threat is serious,
primarily because </p>

<p> of the smuggling resources controlled by the Colombian
cocaine cartels. </p>

<p> At present, Colombian heroin traffickers are attempting to
establish </p>

<p> distribution outlets in the United States, particularly in
the </p>

<p> metropolitan areas of the Northeast, and, as a result, are
smuggling a </p>

<p> heroin of very high purity, generally 80-plus percent. The
high purity </p>

<p> is essential in order for the Colombian traffickers to break
into the </p>

<p> fiercely competitive retail heroin markets in Boston, Newark,
New York </p>

<p> City, and Philadelphia, where street level purity averages
over 50 </p>

<p> percent. Colombian heroin is also available in southern New
England </p>

<p> cities, such as Hartford and Bridgeport, Connecticut, and
Providence, </p>

<p> Rhode Island, where, according to reporting from the Boston
Field </p>

<p> Division, Cali Cartel cocaine networks are operating.
Currently, </p>

<p> significant investigations of Colombian heroin trafficking
organizations </p>

<p> are underway in Miami, Newark, New York City, San Diego, and
San Juan, </p>

<p> Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> Since 1991, most of the Colombian heroin smuggled into the
United States </p>

<p> has been transported by couriers aboard commercial airlines,
a method </p>

<p> requiring numerous couriers carrying amounts ranging up to a
kilogram </p>

<p> per trip. Colombian couriers commonly transport the heroin in
false- </p>

<p> sided briefcases and luggage, inside hollowed-out shoe soles,
or by </p>

<p> internal body carry methods. Much of this activity appears to
be the </p>

<p> work of smaller, independent Colombian traffickers, according
to </p>

<p> investigative reporting from the DEA Bogota Country Office. </p>

<p> According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the number of
Colombian </p>

<p> couriers who were arrested on commercial airlines carrying
heroin into </p>

<p> the United States increased from 41 in 1991 to over 260 in
1992; most of </p>

<p> these seizures occurred at either Miami or New York's
international </p>

<p> airports. The majority of Colombian couriers arrested in
Miami confessed </p>

<p> to being en route to New York City or possessed follow-on
tickets for </p>

<p> that destination. Individuals with an end destination of
Miami were </p>

<p> often instructed to check into a local hotel and await
further </p>

<p> instructions. </p>

<p> The primary method of smuggling (ingestion) employed by
Colombian </p>

<p> traffickers and the seizure amounts (usually less than 500
grams) </p>

<p> indicate that Colombian traffickers presently are not able to
supply </p>

<p> heroin on the same scale as Chinese, Nigerian, or Southwest
Asian </p>

<p> traffickers. To date, the largest shipment seized involved a
June 1992 </p>

<p> airdrop of just under 15 kilograms of heroin on a Puerto
Rican beach; </p>

<p> this shipment may have been tied to the Colombian cocaine
cartels. </p>

<p> However, as the cocaine cartels become more involved in
heroin smuggling </p>

<p> and distribution, the seriousness of the threat will increase
</p>

<p> significantly, given their vast resources, control over
trafficking </p>

<p> routes, and access to a stable cocaine (crack) clientele in
the United </p>

<p> States. </p>

<p> CANNABIS </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> Marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance and by-product
of the </p>

<p> Cannabis sativa L. plant, remained the most commonly used
illegal drug </p>

<p> in the United States during 1992. Both the cannabis plant and
delta-9 </p>

<p> tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant's primary psycho-active
chemical, </p>

<p> are controlled substances. The flowering tops, also known as
colas or </p>

<p> buds, are valued because of their higher THC content. The
flowering tops </p>

<p> and leaves are collected, dried, and then smoked in a pipe or
as a </p>

<p> cigarette. Hashish, which is processed from cannabis, is also
valued to </p>

<p> a limited extent by some individuals in the United States. </p>

<p> Typically, 34 percent of a non-sinsemilla (pollinated) plant
contains </p>

<p> usable material (the leaf and bud components) and 58 percent
of a </p>

<p> sinsemilla (unpollinated female) plant contains usable
material. The </p>

<p> higher the plant density of the grow area, the lower the
yield of usable </p>

<p> material. In addition, the diameter of the plant is more
important than </p>

<p> the height for yield predictions. Indoor plants are generally
smaller </p>

<p> than outdoor plants due to space limitations. The average
plant yield </p>

<p> for mature, domestically grown sinsemilla is approximately
1.25 pounds </p>

<p> per plant. The average plant yield for mature, domestically
grown </p>

<p> commercial grade marijuana is approximately three-quarters of
one pound </p>

<p> per plant. </p>

<p> Marijuana prices have increased substantially over the past
decade. </p>

<p> Prices for a pound of commercial grade marijuana during the
early 1980's </p>

<p> ranged from $350 to $600, while in 1992 the cost ranged from
$300 to </p>

<p> $3,000. Sinsemilla with its inherently higher THC content,
ranged from </p>

<p> $1,000 to $2,000 ten years ago. In 1992, the price ranged
from $650 to </p>

<p> $9,600 per pound. Successful law enforcement efforts have
forced some </p>

<p> cultivators to move indoors. Cultivators have increasingly
moved indoors </p>

<p> to avoid detection and to exploit the profit potential of
potent </p>

<p> sinsemilla marijuana. Indoor growers cultivate sinsemilla
because the </p>

<p> higher THC content of sinsemilla permits growers to charge
higher </p>

<p> prices. Scarcity created by law enforcement operations has
also </p>

<p> increased prices in some areas. </p>

<p> Domestic cultivation trends of significance in recent years
include </p>

<p> cultivator efforts to enhance the potency of marijuana by
making use of </p>

<p> advanced agronomic practices such as hydroponics and cloning.
Such </p>

<p> techniques also involve the use of special fertilizers, plant
hormones, </p>

<p> steroids, and carbon monoxide. During the late 1970's and
early 1980's, </p>

<p> the THC content of commercial grade marijuana averaged under
two </p>

<p> percent. By comparison, the average in 1992 was 3.68 percent.
The </p>

<p> average THC content of sinsemilla in 1992 was 8.34 percent
which </p>

<p> compares to an average of approximately six percent in the
late 1970's </p>

<p> and early 1980's. Moreover, in February 1993, a new U.S.
record was </p>

<p> recorded for the highest concentration of THC analyzed in a
marijuana </p>

<p> sample. The sample had a THC content of 29.86 percent which
is nearly 32 </p>

<p> percent higher than the previous record of 22.67 percent
reported during </p>

<p> 1992. The record high THC content of this sample is an
indicator of the </p>

<p> continuing trend by indoor growers to produce higher potency
marijuana </p>

<p> over recent years. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse, </p>

<p> approximately 67.5 million Americans have tried marijuana at
least once </p>

<p> in their lifetime. Of these, approximately 2.2 million were
from 12 to </p>

<p> 17 years of age, nearly 13.5 million were from 18 to 25 years
of age, </p>

<p> and almost 52 million were 26 years of age and older. Of the
17.4 </p>

<p> million people who used marijuana at least once in the past
year, nine </p>

<p> million used the drug once a month during 1992, and 5.2
million used it </p>

<p> once a week or more. Survey data also indicate that the
frequency of </p>

<p> marijuana use has declined substantially from 1985 to 1992.
Overall, </p>

<p> past-year, past-month and past-week use of the drug have
diminished by </p>

<p> nearly 45 percent during that time frame. </p>

<p> According to the National High School Senior Survey on Drug
Abuse, the </p>

<p> long-term decline in the use of marijuana among seniors
continued in </p>

<p> 1992. However, there was also a decrease in the proportion of
that </p>

<p> population who believed there was a &quot;great risk&quot; of
harm associated with </p>

<p> regular marijuana use, possibly presaging a reversal of the
downward use </p>

<p> pattern. In addition, among 8th graders, lifetime, past-year,
and past- </p>

<p> month use of marijuana marginally increased from 1991 to
1992. Moreover, </p>

<p> 8th graders in the class of 1992 were less likely to view
marijuana use </p>

<p> as dangerous compared to 8th graders in the class of 1991.
Also, the </p>

<p> proportion of 8th graders who personally disapproved of
marijuana use </p>

<p> declined from 1991 to 1992. These shifts in perception may
explain the </p>

<p> increased use of marijuana among 8th graders. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> marijuana-related emergency room episodes, which had declined
from FY </p>

<p> 1989 to FY 1991, increased once again during FY 1992. In
fact, the </p>

<p> number of marijuana-related emergency room episodes rose from
9,231 in </p>

<p> FY 1991 to 12,108 in FY 1992, an increase of more than 30
percent. DAWN </p>

<p> reporting also shows that nearly one-half of the patients
treated for </p>

<p> cannabis-related hospital emergency room episodes during the
first six </p>

<p> months of 1992 were under 26 years of age; approximately 70
percent of </p>

<p> these patients were male. The large majority, approximately
80 percent, </p>

<p> used marijuana in combination with other substances. Patients
most </p>

<p> frequently used marijuana in combination with alcohol. The
next most </p>

<p> common combination involved the use of marijuana with
cocaine. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked male arrestees as
reported by the </p>

<p> DUF Program increased in many major U.S. cities in 1992. The
highest </p>

<p> levels of marijuana use were reported in Omaha, where 38
percent of the </p>

<p> sampled population tested positive through urinalysis. In
Indianapolis, </p>

<p> the figure was 35 percent; in San Diego, 35 percent; in
Denver, 34 </p>

<p> percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 32 percent; and in Miami, 30
percent. </p>

<p> Marijuana use among recently booked female arrestees also
increased in </p>

<p> many cities. In Indianapolis, 26 percent of the female
arrestees sampled </p>

<p> tested positive for the use of marijuana; in San Diego, 25
percent; in </p>

<p> Dallas, 24 percent; in Ft. Lauderdale, 21 percent; in Denver,
19 </p>

<p> percent; and in Kansas City, 18 percent. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> Mexico accounted for most of the foreign marijuana available
in the </p>

<p> United States during 1992. Mexican marijuana is smuggled into
the </p>

<p> southwestern United States by vehicles, private aircraft,
armed </p>

<p> backpackers, and horse or mule caravans. Colombia ranks as a
distant </p>

<p> second behind Mexico as a foreign source of marijuana.
Colombian </p>

<p> marijuana is smuggled into the United States by noncommercial
vessels </p>

<p> using traditional maritime routes. Jamaican traffickers have
increased </p>

<p> marijuana shipments since January 1992. Jamaican marijuana is
smuggled </p>

<p> into the United States by private and commercial aircraft,
and maritime </p>

<p> vessels. </p>

<p> DOMESTIC CULTIVATION/ERADICATION </p>

<p> An estimated 6,000 to 6,500 metric tons of cannabis were
cultivated in </p>

<p> the United States during 1992. During that year,
approximately 3,405 </p>

<p> metric tons, representing 7.49 million cultivated plants,
were </p>

<p> eradicated. Reporting indicates that 31 percent of the
cannabis plants </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992 was sinsemilla. </p>

<p> The five major cultivated cannabis-producing States in 1992
were </p>

<p> Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Hawaii,
respectively. These </p>

<p> States accounted for approximately 44 percent of the
cultivated cannabis </p>

<p> eradicated during 1992. Reports from Indiana and Nebraska
over the last </p>

<p> two years could signal a possible new trend in marijuana
production. The </p>

<p> two States report an increase in tended/enhanced ditchweed, a
form of </p>

<p> marijuana, which grows in the wild. Although ditchweed has
low potency, </p>

<p> it is mixed with cultivated marijuana to increase quantity. </p>

<p> There has been an increase in the cultivation of cannabis
indoors year- </p>

<p> round in elaborately supported operations that have ranged
from several </p>

<p> plants grown in closets to thousands of plants grown in
specially </p>

<p> constructed underground sites capable of producing marijuana
worth </p>

<p> millions of dollars. Growers also continued to plant cannabis
in remote </p>

<p> outdoor areas, often concealed or camouflaged by surrounding
vegetation. </p>

<p> During 1992, the 13th annual DEA-sponsored Domestic Cannabis
Eradication </p>

<p> and Suppression Program (DCE/SP) was conducted in conjunction
with other </p>

<p> Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in 50
States. The </p>

<p> National Guard and Civil Air Patrol also participated. The
DCE/SP </p>

<p> resulted in the eradication of 7.49 million cultivated
cannabis plants, </p>

<p> 264 million low-potency ditchweed plants, the arrest of
12,369 </p>

<p> violators, and the seizure of 5,541 weapons. Moreover, the
number of </p>

<p> indoor growing operations seized in 1992 reached an all-time
high of </p>

<p> 3,849, up from 2,848 seized in 1991. Indoor cultivation
operations were </p>

<p> confiscated in all 50 States during 1992, with the greatest
number, 561, </p>

<p> seized in the State of Washington. The movement toward indoor
production </p>

<p> is believed due primarily to successful law enforcement
efforts to </p>

<p> curtail outdoor cultivation. The average indoor cultivation
operation </p>

<p> has approximately 100 plants. In addition, an average of one
weapon was </p>

<p> seized from each indoor operation. </p>

<p> In recent years, the DCE/SP has placed increasing emphasis on
the </p>

<p> investigation and prosecution of major domestic cannabis
cultivators and </p>

<p> trafficking organizations. The net result during 1992 was the
seizure of </p>

<p> assets valued at over $69.3 million, over twice the amount
seized in </p>

<p> 1989 ($29.5 million). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Park </p>

<p> Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs also have long-term
programs to </p>

<p> combat cannabis cultivation on public lands. </p>

<p> One of the major accomplishments of the DCE/SP continues to
be Hawaii's </p>

<p> Operation WIPEOUT. During 1991, it was estimated that the
program </p>

<p> eradicated approximately 85 percent of Hawaii's summer
cannabis crop. </p>

<p> During 1992, Operation WIPEOUT's continued success was
evidenced by </p>

<p> reports that mainland smugglers were attempting to smuggle
marijuana </p>

<p> into Hawaii in order to fill the vacuum. Operation WIPEOUT is
now </p>

<p> conducted as a maintenance program. Every 90 days, the
WIPEOUT teams </p>

<p> conduct aerial surveillance and eradicate what few cannabis
plants they </p>

<p> find before the plants reach maturity. More emphasis is also
being </p>

<p> placed on arresting cultivators. </p>

<p> Another major accomplishment of the DCE/SP was the successful
lobbying </p>

<p> efforts to convince the California State Government to
consider </p>

<p> herbicidal spraying as a means of eradication. To date, the
California </p>

<p> State Government continues to study the proposal. Previous
requests to </p>

<p> use herbicidal spraying in California were met with strong
resistance </p>

<p> based on environmental, as well as political, concerns.
Spraying will be </p>

<p> conducted in limited areas on a trial basis. Kansas, South
Dakota, and </p>

<p> Texas are also considering herbicidal spray programs. </p>

<p> DEA continues to conduct a special enforcement program
entitled </p>

<p> Operation GREEN MERCHANT that targets major indoor growing
operations. </p>

<p> To date, DEA, together with State and local authorities has
seized </p>

<p> nearly 4,000 growing operations, arrested over 1,500
violators, and </p>

<p> frozen millions of dollars in illicitly acquired profits and
assets. </p>

<p> METHAMPHETAMINE </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/PURITY </p>

<p> Methamphetamine is available in varying quantities in most
areas of the </p>

<p> United States, except for the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
regions </p>

<p> where, for the most part, it is encountered infrequently.
Availability </p>

<p> is primarily concentrated in the western and southwestern
United States </p>

<p> where most clandestine laboratory activity occurs.
Methamphetamine is </p>

<p> also available in limited retail amounts in the Southeast and
somewhat </p>

<p> larger quantities in the Midwest. </p>

<p> The production of methamphetamine, as evidenced by the number
of </p>

<p> reported clandestine laboratory seizures to DEA, has
decreased each year </p>

<p> since 1989. During 1992, 288 methamphetamine laboratories
were seized. </p>

<p> This is in comparison to 652 laboratories seized in 1989, 429
in 1990, </p>

<p> and 315 in 1991. </p>

<p> The decrease in laboratory seizures is attributed to the
ongoing </p>

<p> enforcement of Federal and State chemical control
legislation. The 1988 </p>

<p> Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act (CDTA) became
effective in 1989, </p>

<p> and enables the Federal Government to regulate listed
precursor and </p>

<p> essential chemicals used in the clandestine synthesis of
dangerous </p>

<p> drugs. Over the last three years, most States have passed
legislation </p>

<p> similar to the CDTA. </p>

<p> The price of methamphetamine at the wholesale (pound) level
has remained </p>

<p> relatively constant during the past four years. In 1992,
methamphetamine </p>

<p> prices ranged from $5,000 to $22,000 per pound, $300 to
$2,500 per </p>

<p> ounce, and $45 to $200 per gram. </p>

<p> Nationwide purity of methamphetamine at the ounce and gram
levels </p>

<p> averaged 46 and 53 percent, respectively, during 1992,
compared to 35 </p>

<p> and 34 percent, respectively, during 1991. (Pound-purity
levels are </p>

<p> unavailable due to infrequency of purchases at that level.) </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1991 showed
that an </p>

<p> estimated 5.2 million Americans 12 years of age and older
have used </p>

<p> methamphetamine at least once in their lifetime. (Lifetime
prevalence </p>

<p> rates for 1985, 1988, and 1990 are not available. The
lifetime </p>

<p> prevalence rate for 1992 is not yet available. Data
concerning past- </p>

<p> year, past-month, weekly, and daily prevalence rates for
methamphetamine </p>

<p> are also unavailable.) </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan area </p>

<p> methamphetamine-related emergency room episodes decreased at
a </p>

<p> relatively steady rate from the first half of FY 1989 through
the first </p>

<p> half of FY 1992. However, this downward trend reversed itself
during the </p>

<p> latter half of FY 1992. During the second half of FY 1992,
there was a </p>

<p> 52-percent increase in the number of emergency room episodes
involving </p>

<p> methamphetamine. Despite this, second-half FY 1992 emergency
room </p>

<p> episodes remained below those reported in FY 1989. </p>

<p> DAWN emergency room data indicate that methamphetamine abuse
is </p>

<p> concentrated in the metropolitan areas of San Diego, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Los Angeles In San Diego and Los Angeles,
methamphetamine-related </p>

<p> hospital emergencies increased sharply during the latter half
of 1992. </p>

<p> Nationally, approximately 75 percent of the patients treated
for drug </p>

<p> abuse episodes involving methamphetamine were white; nearly
65 percent </p>

<p> were male; approximately 25 percent were between 18 and 25
years of age, </p>

<p> and 40 percent were between the ages of 26 and 34. </p>

<p> Approximately 45 percent of patients treated in emergency
rooms as a </p>

<p> result of methamphetamine abuse indicated that their use of </p>

<p> methamphetamine was due to dependence. Approximately 20
percent had come </p>

<p> to the emergency room because of an overdose, approximately
30 percent </p>

<p> as a result of an unexpected reaction to the drug, and more
than 20 </p>

<p> percent came due to the chronic effects associated with
methamphetamine </p>

<p> abuse. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN also indicates that the injection of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> continues to be the predominant route of administration used
by patients </p>

<p> admitted to DAWN emergency rooms for methamphetamine-related
problems. </p>

<p> Despite this, the percentage of patients who indicated that
injection </p>

<p> was their primary method of administration decreased slightly
during the </p>

<p> past year from 38.4 percent in FY 1991 to 34.9 percent in FY
1992. </p>

<p> Moreover, there has been an increase in the percentage of
patients who </p>

<p> smoked methamphetamine during the past several years. Those
who smoked </p>

<p> methamphetamine increased from 3.9 percent during FY 1989 to
6.8 percent </p>

<p> during FY 1992. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Laboratory Seizures </p>

<p> Although clandestine methamphetamine laboratory seizures
declined during </p>

<p> 1992, methamphetamine remained the most prevalent,
clandestinely </p>

<p> manufactured controlled substance in the United States.
According to DEA </p>

<p> reporting, 288 methamphetamine laboratories were seized
during 1992, </p>

<p> which accounted for 87 percent of all clandestine dangerous
drug </p>

<p> laboratory seizures. The 1992 figure represents a nine
percent decrease </p>

<p> from the previous year's total of 315 laboratories seized and
continues </p>

<p> the downward trend in laboratory seizures that began in 1990.
</p>

<p> DEA field divisions in Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix,
San Diego, </p>

<p> San Francisco, and Seattle, seized approximately 83 percent
of all </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories during 1992. This clearly
indicates that </p>

<p> the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is still
primarily based </p>

<p> in the western and southwestern United States. </p>

<p> Methamphetamine laboratory seizures declined from 1991 to
1992 in 14 DEA </p>

<p> field divisions including the San Francisco Division which
continued to </p>

<p> report the highest number of seizures. Sixty-seven
clandestine </p>

<p> methamphetamine laboratories were seized during 1992 by the
San </p>

<p> Francisco Division compared to 81 in 1991. However, DEA's Los
Angeles, </p>

<p> San Diego, Phoenix, Dallas, and St. Louis offices reported an
increase </p>

<p> in the number of laboratories seized within their respective
areas. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories have been seized from every
imaginable location </p>

<p> from suburban homes, garages, apartments, mobile trailers,
urban </p>

<p> dwellings, and industrial areas to specially-designed
underground </p>

<p> vaults. The laboratories have been camouflaged,
booby-trapped, buried </p>

<p> underground, conveyed, and abandoned. </p>

<p> Laboratory Operations </p>

<p> Laboratories are usually constructed in very rural areas
across the </p>

<p> United States; however, an increasing number of small
laboratories are </p>

<p> being located in urban and suburban neighborhoods where they
pose a </p>

<p> significant threat to health and safety. Not only are
methamphetamine </p>

<p> laboratories used to produce an illegal, often deadly drug,
but they </p>

<p> have caused explosions, fires, and toxic fumes. Chemicals
associated </p>

<p> with clandestine laboratories have proven to be environmental
pollutants </p>

<p> and health hazards. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratories are usually operated on an irregular
basis </p>

<p> rather than on a regular schedule. Operators often produce a
batch of </p>

<p> methamphetamine then disassemble the laboratory and store it
or move it </p>

<p> to another location while they acquire additional chemicals.
Storage </p>

<p> facilities are often utilized to house (safeguard) chemicals,
glassware, </p>

<p> and the finished product. An operator will often utilize
different </p>

<p> locations to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, it is
not uncommon </p>

<p> for an organization to have multiple laboratory sites.
Relocating the </p>

<p> laboratory affords some protection against detection by law
enforcement </p>

<p> authorities. </p>

<p> Clandestine laboratory operators are often well-armed, and
their </p>

<p> laboratories are occasionally booby-trapped as a security
precaution. </p>

<p> Numerous weapons, including explosives, are routinely
confiscated in </p>

<p> conjunction with clandestine laboratory seizures. Public
safety, and </p>

<p> environmental concerns are of little importance to illicit
drug </p>

<p> laboratory operators. Every year, a number of clandestine
laboratories </p>

<p> experience fires or explosions which lead to their discovery.
Laboratory </p>

<p> operators often waste essential chemicals as they attempt to
synthesize </p>

<p> a high-quality batch of finished product. They usually
dispose of these </p>

<p> and other hazardous chemical wastes by unsafe and illegal
methods, often </p>

<p> dumping these wastes on the ground or in nearby streams and
lakes, </p>

<p> pouring them into local sewage systems, or burying them
underground. </p>

<p> Individuals who synthesize methamphetamine are commonly
referred to as </p>

<p> &quot;chemists&quot; or &quot;cooks.&quot; This level of
education and knowledge of </p>

<p> chemistry can vary from high school dropouts with no real
chemical </p>

<p> knowledge to professional chemists with graduate degrees in
chemistry. </p>

<p> These &quot;cooks&quot; most typically have very little
formal training; rather, </p>

<p> they frequently follow a handwritten recipe or have learned
to </p>

<p> synthesize methamphetamine from underground publications, </p>

<p> apprenticeships, or during incarceration. There are, however,
a number </p>

<p> of &quot;chemists&quot; that are fairly adept or
knowledgeable with regard to </p>

<p> synthesizing methamphetamine. These individuals utilize
chemicals more </p>

<p> efficiently, thus increasing the yield ratio of chemicals to
finished </p>

<p> product. In addition, the &quot;chemist&quot; has the
proficiency to solve </p>

<p> problems which may occur during the manufacturing process.
This is in </p>

<p> contrast to operators who simply follow a recipe and who are
generally </p>

<p> unqualified to perform corrective measures. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURING METHODOLOGIES </p>

<p> Although the manufacture of methamphetamine can be
accomplished by a </p>

<p> variety of chemical synthesis methods, it is most commonly
produced </p>

<p> using the phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) or ephedrine reduction
routes of </p>

<p> synthesis. The ephedrine reduction method was once most often
used in </p>

<p> clandestine laboratories located in California, and has since
become </p>

<p> widespread throughout much of the United States. It is
preferred over </p>

<p> the P2P method of methamphetamine production for three
reasons. First, </p>

<p> it is a simpler route of synthesis; second, the effects of
the resulting </p>

<p> product are more pronounced; and, third, ephedrine is more
readily </p>

<p> available to clandestine laboratories in California and in
the </p>

<p> Southwest. </p>

<p> A relatively new and simple procedure to synthesize
methamphetamine has </p>

<p> been noted using a variation of the ephedrine reduction
method. The </p>

<p> process is being called a &quot;cold cook&quot; method on the
streets because an </p>

<p> external heat source is not required for the synthesis to
proceed. The </p>

<p> method uses commonly available material and chemicals to
manufacture </p>

<p> between one to two ounces of methamphetamine per batch. The
process is </p>

<p> commonly performed in such readily available containers as
two 32-ounce </p>

<p> sports drinking bottles, insulated coffee cups, mugs, or in
modified </p>

<p> laboratory glassware. </p>

<p> CHEMICAL DIVERSION </p>

<p> Integral to the manufacture of illicit methamphetamine are
the chemicals </p>

<p> and equipment necessary to operate a clandestine laboratory.
Whether the </p>

<p> phenyl-2-propanone, ephedrine reduction, or other method of
synthesis is </p>

<p> used, various combinations of chemicals, glassware, and
equipment are </p>

<p> required. The acquisition of chemicals is, therefore, a vital
and </p>

<p> readily identifiable component of the illicit trafficking
cycle. </p>

<p> Chemical control legislation enacted at the Federal and State
level has </p>

<p> made it increasingly difficult for operators to obtain needed
chemicals. </p>

<p> Consequently, trafficking organizations are constantly
seeking new </p>

<p> sources and developing ways in which to circumvent the law.
They </p>

<p> manufacture some of their own chemicals, utilize
&quot;runners&quot; to purchase </p>

<p> necessary chemicals under threshold amounts, and experiment
with </p>

<p> alternate, non-regulated chemicals. Laboratory operators
obtain </p>

<p> regulated chemicals, such as ephedrine, by purchasing
over-the-counter </p>

<p> products which are exempt from the provisions of the CDTA.
Chemicals are </p>

<p> also acquired from &quot;rogue&quot; chemical companies or in
States which have </p>

<p> less restrictive chemical laws or in such countries as Mexico
and </p>

<p> Canada. </p>

<p> MANUFACTURlNG/DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATIONS </p>

<p> Methamphetamine manufacturing/distribution operations vary
greatly in </p>

<p> size, structure, and degree of sophistication. Some
laboratory operators </p>

<p> act as their own chemists; others hire chemists to run the
laboratories </p>

<p> for them. Many manufacturers are independent producers who
cook for </p>

<p> various organized groups. This is particularly true of larger
</p>

<p> organizations which may hire or contract chemists to
manufacture </p>

<p> methamphetamine in return for cash, finished product, or a
combination </p>

<p> of the two. Other cooks manufacture for themselves rather
than for a </p>

<p> particular organization. Leasing storage facilities,
procuring </p>

<p> chemicals, securing the laboratory site, and setting up
glassware and </p>

<p> equipment may be the responsibility of one person or many
different </p>

<p> individuals. Several individuals may simply work together to
combine </p>

<p> their expertise, chemicals, etc., on an ad hoc basis. The
number of </p>

<p> individuals which comprise an operation and the function each
performs </p>

<p> differs from one organization to the next. </p>

<p> Throughout the United States, numerous individuals, groups,
and </p>

<p> organizations from independent entrepreneurs and outlaw
motorcycle gangs </p>

<p> to Mexican poly-drug trafficking organizations currently
manufacture and </p>

<p> distribute methamphetamine. Nationally, independent
entrepreneurs </p>

<p> represent the largest identifiable group involved in
methamphetamine- </p>

<p> related investigations. To a lesser degree, outlaw motorcycle
gangs </p>

<p> continue to play a role in the distribution aspect and
influence </p>

<p> production in certain areas. They most typically insulate
themselves by </p>

<p> financing manufacturing operations rather than becoming
directly </p>

<p> involved themselves. </p>

<p> The most noteworthy trend in recent years is currently taking
place in </p>

<p> California where Mexican traffickers dominate the large-scale
production </p>

<p> and distribution of methamphetamine in the San Diego,
Riverside, San </p>

<p> Bernadino, and Fresno areas. In fact, the high volume of
methamphetamine </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed is the distinguishing
characteristic of </p>

<p> Mexican traffickers involved in dangerous drug production. </p>

<p> Numerous 22-liter setups are frequently utilized in
laboratories </p>

<p> operated by Mexican traffickers to produce an average of 20
to 80 pounds </p>

<p> during each manufacturing process. Traffickers set up
laboratories or </p>

<p> &quot;cooks&quot; in very remote areas throughout southern
and parts of northern </p>

<p> California Organizations may purchase property or pay for the
short-term </p>

<p> use of a site in order to acquire a secure manufacturing
location. An </p>

<p> organization may utilize one location multiple times. </p>

<p> Mexican illegal aliens are most frequently encountered at
these </p>

<p> laboratory sites. In some cases, they are hired as helpers or
to </p>

<p> maintain the reaction process, while the actual chemist
visits </p>

<p> periodically to ensure the operation is functioning properly.
In other </p>

<p> cases, Mexican illegal aliens are responsible for all facets
of the </p>

<p> manufacturing process. Chemicals are generally stored in
stash houses </p>

<p> and brought to the laboratory site on a limited basis. The
amount of </p>

<p> chemicals present at the laboratory is usually restricted to
what is </p>

<p> required to complete a particular cook. </p>

<p> Chemicals are procured for these laboratories from sources in
the United </p>

<p> States and Mexico. Chemical brokers recruit runners to make
purchases at </p>

<p> rogue chemical companies. Additionally, ephedrine, a
precursor for </p>

<p> methamphetamine, is easily accessible to Mexican traffickers;
the </p>

<p> chemical is currently shipped, without restriction, from
Germany to </p>

<p> Mexico and subsequently smuggled across the United
States-Mexican border </p>

<p> in privately owned vehicles. Moreover, brokers supply
chemicals to </p>

<p> numerous manufacturing organizations. Organizations assist
each other in </p>

<p> obtaining chemicals and glassware. A certain amount of
cooperation </p>

<p> exists among many of these organizations; links between these
groups </p>

<p> were already established through their long-standing cocaine,
heroin, </p>

<p> and marijuana connections. </p>

<p> There are indications that groups which previously
manufactured </p>

<p> methamphetamine are now finding it more cost effective to
purchase it </p>

<p> from Mexican sources. In addition, there is limited evidence
to suggest </p>

<p> that Mexican traffickers may be attempting to expand their
operations to </p>

<p> other areas of the country. There are also indications that </p>

<p> methamphetamine is currently being manufactured in Mexico and
</p>

<p> subsequently smuggled into the United States. </p>

<p> SOURCE AREAS </p>

<p> California is a primary source for methamphetamine in many
areas </p>

<p> throughout the United States. However, the manner in which
manufacturing </p>

<p> operations are carried out often makes it difficult to
determine the </p>

<p> origin of the source of supply. Operators manufacturing in a
particular </p>

<p> area may distribute the finished product to associates
residing locally, </p>

<p> in neighboring States, or in other geographic areas.
Privately owned </p>

<p> vehicles are the modes of transportation used most frequently
in the </p>

<p> nationwide distribution of methamphetamine. </p>

<p> LSD </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE/POTENCY </p>

<p> DEA reporting indicates that LSD (Iysergic acid diethylamide)
is </p>

<p> available in at least retail quantities in virtually every
State in the </p>

<p> United States and that availability is increasing in a number
of States. </p>

<p> Reporting also indicates that an increasing number of
individuals or </p>

<p> groups are manufacturing and distributing or attempting to
manufacture </p>

<p> and distribute LSD in the United States. In the last two
years, DEA </p>

<p> seized or purchased LSD in 33 States and Washington, D.C. LSD
</p>

<p> availability has been reported by either DEA offices or State
and local </p>

<p> police authorities in many of the remaining 17 States.
Northern </p>

<p> California appears to be the source of supply for most of the
LSD </p>

<p> available in the United States. </p>

<p> LSD is available in several forms, including blotter paper,
tablets, </p>

<p> gelatin, sugar cubes, and liquid. Tablets can be purchased in
several </p>

<p> areas, however, most of the retail doses are in the
blotter-paper form. </p>

<p> Microdots are available in California, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, New </p>

<p> Jersey, and Vermont. Gelatin in the &quot;windowpane&quot;
variety has been </p>

<p> reported in Michigan and sugar cubes are available in
Colorado and the </p>

<p> Washington, D.C., area. Personal-use doses of liquid LSD in
vials have </p>

<p> also been reported in Colorado, Illinois, New York, and West
Virginia. </p>

<p> LSD is relatively inexpensive. The average price is
approximately five </p>

<p> dollars per retail dosage unit and costs less than one dollar
per dosage </p>

<p> unit in wholesale lots of 1,000 dosage units or more. When
compared with </p>

<p> marijuana, which sells for $40 to $450 per ounce, LSD is
perceived by </p>

<p> many drug users as a bargain, especially if one considers the
duration </p>

<p> of its effects which can persist for up to 12 hours in higher
doses. </p>

<p> Although there has been some fluctuation in the price of LSD
nationally </p>

<p> during the past several years, overall prices remain
relatively low. </p>

<p> LSD potency or strength is measured in micrograms. In the
1960's and </p>

<p> early 1970's, LSD potency generally ranged from 100 to 200
micrograms </p>

<p> per dosage unit or higher. Analysis of exhibits during the
late 1970's </p>

<p> indicated an average potency in the 30- to 50-microgram
range. From the </p>

<p> mid-1980's to the present, LSD potency has remained
considerably below </p>

<p> levels reported during the 1960's and early 1970's and has
generally </p>

<p> been in the range of 20 to 80 micrograms per dosage unit. As
a result of </p>

<p> this comparatively low dosage level, many users perceive LSD
as &quot;safe,&quot; </p>

<p> thus enhancing the drug's attractiveness. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse data for LSD are
limited to </p>

<p> estimates of lifetime use, defined as the use of LSD at least
once in a </p>

<p> person's lifetime. During 1991, 11.8 million Americans, 12
years of age </p>

<p> and older, reported having used LSD at least once compared to
8.4 </p>

<p> million in 1985, an increase of 40 percent. The data reveal
two </p>

<p> significant expansions in the number of lifetime users of
LSD; one </p>

<p> expansion occurred from 1985 to 1988 and the other from 1990
to 1991. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Survey on Drug
Abuse, past </p>

<p> year use of LSD among seniors in the class of 1992 increased
to the </p>

<p> highest level since at least 1985. Current (monthly) use of
LSD among </p>

<p> 10th and 12th grade students remained relatively stable from
1991 to </p>

<p> 1992. Among 8th graders, however, current use of LSD
increased during </p>

<p> that same time frame from 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.
Moreover, past- </p>

<p> year use of LSD rose in all three grade levels from 1991 to
1992. </p>

<p> DAWN reports indicate that the estimated number of nationwide
LSD- </p>

<p> related hospital emergency room episodes increased from FY
1989 to FY </p>

<p> 1990. Although abuse patterns have been somewhat erratic
since that </p>

<p> period, the current number of LSD-related episodes remain
above those </p>

<p> reported during FY 1989. </p>

<p> ILLICIT MANUFACTURE AND TRAFFICKING </p>

<p> A total of six clandestine synthesis LSD laboratories have
been seized </p>

<p> since 1981; however, these were all seized prior to 1987. </p>

<p> LSD producers fall into two groups. The first is composed of
chemists, </p>

<p> manufacturers, and distributors, located in northern
California, who </p>

<p> work together in close association; they are normally major </p>

<p> manufacturers capable of distributing LSD nationwide. The
second group </p>

<p> of producers work independently. The independent producers
are </p>

<p> encountered in almost any part of the country, however, their
product is </p>

<p> intended for local consumption only. </p>

<p> Wholesale LSD trafficking patterns are not well understood;
however, </p>

<p> three theoretical models have been developed, which outline </p>

<p> organizational structures, production methods, and
trafficking patterns. </p>

<p> These theoretical models may help to explain how clandestine
LSD </p>

<p> activity occurs. Law enforcement officials call these
organizational </p>

<p> patterns: the Independent Entrepreneurial Model, the
Inner/Outer Circle </p>

<p> Group Model, and the Association Model. </p>

<p> The Independent Entrepreneurial Model: A number of law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials believe some LSD manufacturers and distributors,
who are not </p>

<p> part of the northern California group, entered the market due
to </p>

<p> increased demand and the opportunity for high returns on a
small </p>

<p> investment. Examples of this type of loosely-structured
organization </p>

<p> have been noted in cases in Austin, Texas; New Orleans,
Louisiana; </p>

<p> Hartford, Connecticut; and Denver and Boulder, Colorado. The
common </p>

<p> feature in each of these cases was an individual or a small
group of </p>

<p> individuals who manufactured LSD independently from any
California </p>

<p> source of supply. Some entrepreneurs who have manufactured or
have </p>

<p> attempted to manufacture LSD have been known to law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials for years; however, the number of independent
traffickers </p>

<p> appears to have increased recently. </p>

<p> The Inner Circle/Outer Circle or Single Group Model: This
model is </p>

<p> thought to be organized under one close-knit group, the inner
circle, </p>

<p> which controls the vast majority of LSD manufacturing and
distribution </p>

<p> in the United States. The inner circle is probably composed
of five to </p>

<p> 10 principal individuals who possess specialized functions.
These </p>

<p> specialists would include chemists, bulk storage custodians, </p>

<p> financial/transportation specialists, and executives who
manage overall </p>

<p> operations. The inner circle controls the means of
manufacture; they </p>

<p> assemble, operate, disassemble, and store laboratory
equipment; and keep </p>

<p> a reserve amount of LSD on hand for distribution. They sell
from 10- to </p>

<p> 200-gram lots to a limited number of multigram distributors.
This inner </p>

<p> circle presumably accrues multimillion-dollar profits and
only conducts </p>

<p> business with the next level of distribution referred to as
the &quot;outer </p>

<p> circle.&quot; </p>

<p> The outer circle consists of multigram distributors who
supply a number </p>

<p> of teams, groups, or individuals. They sell LSD at $1,000 to
$3,000 per </p>

<p> gram and accrue an estimated $300,000 to $600,000 per year. </p>

<p> Close Association Model (An alternative theory to the Inner
Circle/Outer </p>

<p> Circle or Single Group Model): In this model, a small group
of people </p>

<p> located in northern California, who have known each other for
over two </p>

<p> decades, control the manufacture and distribution of LSD.
However, in </p>

<p> contrast with the Inner Circle/Outer Circle theory, these
people do not </p>

<p> work in one structured organization. They come together, as
necessary, </p>

<p> to acquire chemists, chemicals, working capital, etc. They
work as </p>

<p> consultants or advisors to each other in order to meet their
common goal </p>

<p> of producing and distributing LSD. They may work together as
a unit to </p>

<p> prepare and distribute one batch of LSD, but after that is
accomplished, </p>

<p> they leave the association until another opportunity arises.
They have </p>

<p> strong loyalty to each other and are living comfortably, but
they are </p>

<p> not thought to be motivated primarily by profit. </p>

<p> DISTRIBUTION </p>

<p> Lower-level distribution of LSD usually occurs in three ways.
First, an </p>

<p> individual attends a rock concert, meets a source of supply,
and </p>

<p> exchanges telephone numbers with the source of supply.
Normally, these </p>

<p> purchases are for retail quantities of up to 100 doses.
Second, if this </p>

<p> individual decides to continue distributing, he/she would
then call the </p>

<p> source for additional amounts. Usually the source has either
continued </p>

<p> on the concert tour or has returned home, which is frequently
northern </p>

<p> California. If the source intends to stay on the tour-making
subsequent </p>

<p> communication difficult-the source provides the telephone
number of an </p>

<p> associate for future orders. After the initial purchase,
almost all </p>

<p> transactions are made via the public and private mail
systems. Payments </p>

<p> to a source of supply are usually made through legitimate
money wiring </p>

<p> services. Third, some dealers travel directly to California
to meet </p>

<p> their sources of supply. </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that shipment methods used to transport
both large </p>

<p> and small quantities of LSD are often similar. LSD is
frequently </p>

<p> concealed in greeting cards, in cassette tapes, or in
articles of </p>

<p> clothing that are mailed to a post office box established by
the </p>

<p> recipient. This post office box is usually listed under a
fictitious </p>

<p> name or business. Normally, no return address is provided on
the package </p>

<p> or envelope. Moreover, it is suspected that some multigram
distributors </p>

<p> will travel to their source in order to obtain supplies. </p>

<p> Retail or user level quantities range from one- to 10-dosage
units. Low- </p>

<p> level distributors sell 50- to 100-dosage-unit quantities.
Mid-level </p>

<p> distributors sell 1,000-dosage-unit quantities as well as
multiples of </p>

<p> 1,000 units. These distributors normally have more than one
source of </p>

<p> supply and sell to several lower-level dealers. The sources
of supply </p>

<p> for gram-distributors are in all likelihood located in
northern </p>

<p> California. These sources normally convert LSD from powder or
liquid </p>

<p> form to blotter form. Multigram distributors travel to
California to </p>

<p> obtain LSD personally and are in association with numerous
lower-level </p>

<p> dealers. </p>

<p> PCP </p>

<p> AVAILABILITY/PRICE </p>

<p> Phencyclidine, commonly referred to as PCP, is available in
varying </p>

<p> degrees in a limited number of U.S. cities, primarily
Baltimore, </p>

<p> Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San
Francisco, and </p>

<p> Washington, D.C. During 1992, PCP in liquid form, the most
common form </p>

<p> available in the United States, sold for $150 to $1,000 per
ounce </p>

<p> nationally. The lowest liquid-ounce prices were reported in
Los Angeles, </p>

<p> the source for most of the PCP trafficked in the United
States, where </p>

<p> such quantities sold for $150 to $300. Nationwide, the price
for PCP in </p>

<p> powdered form ranged from $400 to $2,000 per ounce. During
1992, the </p>

<p> price for a gallon of PCP ranged from $3,000 to $10,000 in
Los Angeles </p>

<p> and up to $13,000 in New York City. Individual cigarettes
saturated with </p>

<p> PCP sold for between $5 dollars and $70 nationwide. </p>

<p> USE </p>

<p> PCP is sold on the street under numerous names including:
Angel Dust, </p>

<p> Crystal, Supergrass, Killer Joints, Ozone, Wack, Embalming
Fluid, and </p>

<p> Rocket Fuel. These names reflect the range of its bizarre and
volatile </p>

<p> effects. The liquid form of PCP is the most commonly
encountered, but it </p>

<p> is also sold in tablets, capsules, and as a powder. PCP is
typically </p>

<p> applied to a leafy material such as mint, parsley, oregano,
or </p>

<p> marijuana, and then smoked. PCP has been used to adulterate </p>

<p> commercially-manufactured cigarettes, usually by dipping them
in liquid </p>

<p> PCP, which is PCP dissolved in ether. The most popular
commercial </p>

<p> cigarettes are dark paper-wrapped brands such as Shermans or
Tijuana </p>

<p> Smalls. PCP can also be injected hypodermically into
cigarettes. </p>

<p> In 1957, PCP was developed as a human anesthetic and later
used in </p>

<p> veterinary medicine as a powerful tranquilizer. In 1965,
medical use for </p>

<p> humans was discontinued because of adverse side effects such
as </p>

<p> confusion and delirium. In 1978, its commercial manufacture
was </p>

<p> discontinued and PCP was transferred from Schedule III to
Schedule II of </p>

<p> the Controlled Substances Act, thus classifying it as a drug
with a high </p>

<p> potential for abuse. </p>

<p> PCP enjoyed a brief popularity in the late 1960's when it was
trafficked </p>

<p> as a &quot;Magic Peace Pill.&quot; Abuse of the drug
resurfaced from the mid-to- </p>

<p> late 1970's because of low price and powerful effects. From
the period </p>

<p> 1981 through 1985, abuse of the drug escalated significantly,
</p>

<p> particularly among persons under the age of 21. Cities which
experienced </p>

<p> significant PCP availability and abuse levels in the
early-to-mid-1980's </p>

<p> included Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New
Orleans, New York </p>

<p> City, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Washington,
D.C. </p>

<p> Around 1986, and continuing through the early 1990's, demand
for PCP was </p>

<p> displaced in large measure by the widespread availability and
use of </p>

<p> crack cocaine. More recently, however, there are indications
that PCP </p>

<p> abuse is increasing once again in a number of cities. </p>

<p> The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse showed that
lifetime and </p>

<p> past-year PCP use among the U.S. household population
decreased from </p>

<p> 1985 to 1990; however, 1991 and 1992 survey data indicate an
end to this </p>

<p> downward use pattern. From 1990 to 1992, the number of
Americans aged 12 </p>

<p> years and older, who used PCP at least once, increased from
six million </p>

<p> to 8.2 million, while the number who had used PCP in the past
year </p>

<p> increased from 307,000 to 467,000. Nevertheless, the number
of past-year </p>

<p> users in 1992 remained significantly below the number
reported in 1985 </p>

<p> when approximately 1.2 million Americans reported using PCP
at least </p>

<p> once yearly. </p>

<p> According to the 1992 National High School Senior Survey on
Drug Abuse, </p>

<p> PCP use among 12th graders has declined significantly during
the past </p>

<p> seven years. From 1985 to 1992, the percentage of seniors who
used PCP </p>

<p> at least once in their lifetime decreased from 4.9 percent to
2.4 </p>

<p> percent. Comparable declines were also reported during that
same period </p>

<p> in the percentage of seniors who used PCP during the past
year and past </p>

<p> month as well as on a daily basis. This diminished use is
believed to be </p>

<p> due in large part to a significant increase among 12th
graders in the </p>

<p> perceived risk of harm associated with PCP usage. </p>

<p> Reporting from DAWN shows that the estimated number of
metropolitan-area </p>

<p> PCP-related emergency room episodes, which had been declining
at a </p>

<p> substantial rate during the past three years, rose from 1,353
during the </p>

<p> first half of FY 1992 to 2,380 during the second half of FY
1992, more </p>

<p> than a 75-percent increase. Cities having high or increased
PCP abuse </p>

<p> rates during the second half of FY 1992 included Baltimore,
Chicago, Los </p>

<p> Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and
Washington, </p>

<p> D.C. </p>

<p> TRAFFICKING AND ILLICIT MANUFACTURE </p>

<p> Reporting indicates that the majority of the nation's PCP
supply is </p>

<p> manufactured and distributed by Los Angeles-based street
gangs. While </p>

<p> buses, trains, and airlines are used to transport PCP from
California </p>

<p> sources of supply, private automobiles are believed to be the
primary </p>

<p> means for transporting PCP across the country. Female
couriers are used </p>

<p> very frequently and the amounts transported generally range
from one to </p>

<p> two quarts. PCP traffickers also use the U.S. mail system and
express </p>

<p> delivery services to transport PCP. </p>

<p> Four PCP laboratories were seized in 1992 compared to three
in 1991. Two </p>

<p> of the 1992 seizures were in northern California and one each
near </p>

<p> Chicago and Philadelphia. PCP laboratory seizures since the
mid-1980's </p>

<p> have ranged from three to 21 per year, totals which are
considerably </p>

<p> less than the high of 79 reported in 1978. No PCP
laboratories have been </p>

<p> seized thus far in 1993. </p>

<p> APPENDIX </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, sponsored by the
Substance </p>

<p> Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), is
a series of </p>

<p> national surveys to measure the prevalence and frequency of
drug use </p>

<p> among the U.S. household population aged 12 and over. The
survey samples </p>

<p> the civilian non-institutionalized population living in
households, </p>

<p> college dormitories, and military installations and,
therefore, does not </p>

<p> include some segments of the U.S. population which may
contain a </p>

<p> substantial proportion of drug users, such as transients and
those who </p>

<p> are incarcerated. The SAMHSA publishes survey results on an
annual </p>

<p> basis. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SURVEY is a series of
nationwide studies </p>

<p> of drug use frequency and related attitudes among high school
seniors in </p>

<p> the United States. The survey is conducted annually by the
University of </p>

<p> Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded by
research grants </p>

<p> from the SAMHSA. In addition to high school seniors, the
study includes </p>

<p> the recently-added national surveys of 8th and 10th grade
students. For </p>

<p> the 1992 survey, approximately 50,000 8th-, 10th-, and
12th-grade </p>

<p> students across the country were questioned. </p>

<p> The DRUG ABUSE WARNING NETWORK (DAWN) is a large-scale data
collection </p>

<p> system implemented in 1972 and designed to be an indicator of
the </p>

<p> severity, scope, and nature of the nation's substance abuse
problem. The </p>

<p> purpose of DAWN is to provide data on the incidence of drug
abuse </p>

<p> related episodes from participating hospital emergency rooms
located in </p>

<p> 21 U.S. metropolitan areas. DAWN is managed by the SAMHSA. </p>

<p> The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (NIJ) established the Drug
Use </p>

<p> Forecasting Program (DUF) in 1987 to identify and monitor
trends in drug </p>

<p> use among arrestees in the United States. Each quarter, at
central </p>

<p> booking facilities in 24 participating jurisdictions,
arrestees are </p>

<p> asked to participate in a voluntary, anonymous interview and
to provide </p>

<p> a urine specimen. Urine samples are analyzed to detect the
use of </p>

<p> cocaine, opiates, marijuana, PCP, methadone, benzodiazines
(such as </p>

<p> Valium), methaqualone, propoxyphene (such as Darvon),
barbiturates, and </p>

<p> amphetamines. The results of the urinalysis testing are
published by the </p>

<p> NIJ on a quarterly and annual basis. </p>

<p>COCA CULTIVATION AND COCAINE PROCESSING: </p>

<p>AN OVERVIEW </p>

<p>DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE DIVISION </p>

<p>STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE SECTION </p>

<p>SEPTEMBER 1993 </p>

<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY </p>

<p>Two of the lesser understood aspects of the illicit cocaine
traffic are the </p>

<p>cultivation of the coca plant and the conversion of the coca
leaf into </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride (HCl). While the coca plant can be found
throughout </p>

<p>most of Latin America, varieties containing the cocaine
alkaloid (the basis </p>

<p>for cocaine HCl) are cultivated and converted primarily in
Peru, Bolivia and </p>

<p>Colombia. </p>

<p>There are two different species and several different
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plants which contain the cocaine alkaloid and these varieties
prosper under </p>

<p>quite different climatic conditions. At the same time, the
methods used to </p>

<p>cultivate and harvest coca leaf differ depending on
climate,tradition,and </p>

<p>other factors. The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste,
cocaine base, and </p>

<p>cocaine hydrochloride is also a varied process with many steps
involved and </p>

<p>many chemicals necessary. </p>

<p>THE COCA PLANT </p>

<p>It has been estimated that there are over 200 Erythroxylum
species growing in </p>

<p>the Western Hemisphere. Only 17 species can be utilized to
produce cocaine. </p>

<p>Fifteen of the 17 species contain relatively low levels of
cocaine alkaloid </p>

<p>and subsequently are not cultivated. In South America two
species and two </p>

<p>varieties within each of these species are cultivated. They
are: </p>

<p>--E. coca Species </p>

<p>var. coca </p>

<p>var. ipadu </p>

<p>--E. novogranatense Species </p>

<p>var. novogranatense </p>

<p>var. truxillense </p>

<p>These varieties are traditionally cultivated in the following
areas: </p>

<p>--Bolivia </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>--Peru </p>

<p>E. coca var. coca </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>--Colombia </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense </p>

<p>E. coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. truxillense </p>

<p>The most widely grown variety of coca is E. coca var. coca
which is </p>

<p>cultivated on the eastern slope of the Andes from Bolivia in
the south to as </p>

<p>far north as central Ecuador. This area of the Andes has a
tropical climate </p>

<p>and experiences high amounts of rainfall. Coca in this region
is usually </p>

<p>grown between 1,650 and 4,950 feet in elevation. </p>

<p>E. novogranatense var. novogranatense thrives in the drier
regions of </p>

<p>Colombia and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. It is also grown
at lower </p>

<p>elevations where the climate is generally hotter. The main
variety of </p>

<p>E.novogranatense, var. truxillense, is grown up to an
elevation of 4,950 </p>

<p>feet. The last variety, E. coca var. ipadu, is found in
southern Colombia, </p>

<p>northeastern Peru, and western Brazil in the Amazon basin. E.
coca var. ipadu </p>

<p>is primarily cultivated by Indians for their own consumption
and is not as </p>

<p>high in cocaine alkaloids as the other three. </p>

<p>It is not an easy task, even for an expert, to readily
distinguish between </p>

<p>the different varieties of coca plants. One of the ways to
identify the </p>

<p>variety is to look at the leaves. Both varieties of E. coca
(E. coca var. </p>

<p>coca and E. coca var. ipadu) have broadly elliptic leaves. The
leaf of var. </p>

<p>ipadu has a rounded apex, whereas the apex of var. coca is
more pointed. The </p>

<p>leaf of var. coca is large, thick and dark green in color. </p>

<p>The leaf of E. novogranatense var. novogranatense is pale
green with a </p>

<p>rounded apex and is somewhat narrower and thinner than the
leaf of var. ipadu </p>

<p>and var.coca. E. novogranatense var. truxillense is very
similar to var. </p>

<p>novogranatense except that it does not possess the lines
parallel to the </p>

<p>central vein of the leaf that are characteristic to so many
varieties of coca </p>

<p>plant. </p>

<p>The cocaine alkaloid content of the E. coca and the E.
novogranatense species </p>

<p>also serves to distinguish between these species and the many
other species </p>

<p>of wild coca that grow in Latin America. These other species
contain much </p>

<p>lower levels of cocaine alkaloid. The usual cocaine alkaloid
content of a </p>

<p>sample of coca leaf material is between 0.1 and 0.8 percent.
The cocaine </p>

<p>alkaloid content can go much higher, however, as was shown in
one sample of </p>

<p>coca leaf from the Chapare region in Bolivia that measured 1.2
percent. Coca </p>

<p>grown on the upper slopes of the Andes also contain more
cocaine alkaloids </p>

<p>than coca grown in low-lying areas. It is therefore believed
that the best </p>

<p>quality coca is grown at higher altitudes. </p>

<p>CULTIVATION </p>

<p>While methods of cultivating the coca plant are similar in
many ways </p>

<p>throughout Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, there are differences
in techniques </p>

<p>because of terrain, tradition, and other factors. </p>

<p>Some coca plantations have been in existence for years. In
other areas, </p>

<p>however, such as Peru's Upper Huauaga Valley, new plantations
are being </p>

<p>established daily. A typical farmer who is preparing a field
for coca will </p>

<p>usually pick an area that slopes slightly so that water will
not drown his </p>

<p>plants. He will then begin clearing his field, normally by
cutting trees and </p>

<p>stumps and setting fire to the debris, a clearing method known
as slash and </p>

<p>bum. The felled trees are left in the field and the coca is
simply planted </p>

<p>around them. The farmer has no motivation to move the logs
since there is no </p>

<p>market for the timber. Logs are absent from the older fields
because of rot </p>

<p>or because the farmer gradually cleared his field. </p>

<p>Once the field is cleared for cultivation, the farmer can
ready his crop for </p>

<p>planting. The first step in cultivation generally begins with
the seed. Seeds </p>

<p>are usually gathered from December through March from plants
ranging from two </p>

<p>to three years in age. They are often poured into water at the
onset to </p>

<p>identify bad seeds, which will usually float to the top and
are discarded. </p>

<p>The good seeds are planted in small plots that are kept shaded
from the sun. </p>

<p>Seeds are sown about two inches apart at a depth of
approximately one half </p>

<p>inch in humus enriched soil. These seedbeds are kept well
watered and weeded </p>

<p>frequently and the seeds will usually germinate within 20 to
30 days. </p>

<p>Sometimes the seeds are presoaked in water to hasten
germination which will </p>

<p>then occur in about ten days. </p>

<p>Seedlings usually reach transplanting size in about two
months. At this age </p>

<p>they are about 12 inches tall. While the measurements vary,
seedlings </p>

<p>generally are planted in holes about a foot deep and about one
and-one-half </p>

<p>feet from each other within rows about three feet apart. </p>

<p>Another popular method of establishing new fields of E. ipadu
involves taking </p>

<p>a cutting from an established coca bush and planting it in the
ground. This </p>

<p>method (cloning) is getting more popular as it gives the
farmer a head start. </p>

<p>There are two methods of planting a cutting. One involves
sticking several </p>

<p>branches a couple of feet long into the ground. The other
method is to cut </p>

<p>three or four inch cuttings from a branch, each one with
protruding smaller </p>

<p>branches. The cutting is soaked in water a day or so and then
planted in </p>

<p>loose, fertile soil. It is reported that coca leaf can be
harvested from </p>

<p>these plants within six months and seeds develop on these
plants after one </p>

<p>year but the seeds lack embryos and are not viable. </p>

<p>A coca plant cultivated from seed will generally reach full
maturity and its </p>

<p>leaves harvested between 12 and 24 months after being
transplanted. Even </p>

<p>though coca growing in the wild has been known to reach
heights of up to 30 </p>

<p>feet, that which is cultivated is almost always pruned back to
facilitate </p>

<p>harvesting the coca leaf. Cultivated fields are usually kept
at a height of </p>

<p>three to six feet. All picking of coca leaf is done by hand.
Harvesters have </p>

<p>to be very quick in their work yet careful not to damage the
leaf buds on the </p>

<p>bush while stripping off the leaves. Leaves are said to be
ready for harvest </p>

<p>when they take on a yellowish tint and have a tendency to
crack when bent. </p>

<p>Coca leaf can be harvested between two and six times per year
depending on </p>

<p>climatic conditions. Coca growing at lower altitudes will
usually be </p>

<p>harvested more often than coca growing at higher altitudes.
The most abundant </p>

<p>harvest, sometimes accounting for about half of the total
yearly harvest, </p>

<p>takes place after the rains in March. Subsequent harvests take
place in </p>

<p>June/July and November, the normal dry season in South
America. Some </p>

<p>harvesting, however, takes place all year round. </p>

<p>When the leaves are harvested, they are put in sacks and taken
to a closed </p>

<p>room and spread out on the floor. The next day, the leaves are
taken to a </p>

<p>flat area, where they are spread in thin layers on a tarpaulin
in direct </p>

<p>sunlight and left to dry. If there is a lot of sunshine and
minimal cloud </p>

<p>cover, the drying phase can be completed in six hours. During
inclement </p>

<p>weather, it takes much longer because at the first sign of
rain the leaves </p>

<p>are gathered up and taken into shelter. If a load of coca
leaves is caught by </p>

<p>a rainstorm during drying, it could ruin the whole load. This
is because the </p>

<p>leaves will ferment if the moisture goes over 14 percent. This
tends to cause </p>

<p>a breakdown of the cocaine alkaloids. </p>

<p>After the drying phase is completed, the coca leaves are swept
into large </p>

<p>piles and left for about three days before being taken to
market and/or </p>

<p>processing facilities. The weight of packaged leaves varies
from the 100 </p>

<p>pound &quot;carga&quot; in the Bolivian Chapare, to the 25
pound &quot;arroba&quot; in Peru's </p>

<p>Upper Huallaga Valley. In Colombia, coca leaves are not
usually sold; </p>

<p>however, when dried coca leaves are sold, it is usually in
packages of 25 </p>

<p>pounds. </p>

<p>Peru </p>

<p>Peru, the world's largest source of coca, has both licit and
illicit </p>

<p>cultivation. Licit coca is cultivation by farmers registered
with the </p>

<p>National Coca Monopoly (ENACO). ENACO buys and sells it to
retailers either </p>

<p>for resale domestically, for chewing or for herbal tea, or for
export to </p>

<p>produce soft drink flavoring or pharmaceuticals. The 18,000
hectares that </p>

<p>have been registered for licit coca cultivation are centered
in the </p>

<p>department of Cuzco. </p>

<p>Illicit coca cultivation occurs primarily in the Upper
Huallaga Valley region </p>

<p>of northern Peru including the departments of San Martin,
Huanuco, and </p>

<p>Ucayali. Other areas under cultivation include the valleys of
La Convencion </p>

<p>and Lares in the department of Cuzco, and the provinces of
Huanta and La Mar </p>

<p>along the Rio Apurimac in the department of Ayachucho. There
are also smaller </p>

<p>growing areas located in the departments of Puno and Pasco. </p>

<p>The Upper Huallaga Valley is a tropical area with a mild
climate that </p>

<p>receives an average of 12.44 feet of rain during the year.
June through </p>

<p>September is the dry season when the region gets very little
rainfall. The </p>

<p>mean annual temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Coca is
usually grown here </p>

<p>between 1,980 to 2,640 feet above sea level but is sometimes
planted up to </p>

<p>6,270 feet in altitude. The soil in the Upper Huallaga Valley
is well drained </p>

<p>and rich in iron, an important element for all plant life. </p>

<p>The area surrounding Cuzco has an average rainfall of between
1.32 and 5.94 </p>

<p>feet annually which usually falls between the months of
October and April. </p>

<p>The average temperatures in this region are greater than 53
degrees </p>

<p>Fahrenheit. Coca is generally grown between 2,409 and 4,257
feet above sea </p>

<p>level. The soil is especially poor in iron content. </p>

<p>A semi-tropical climate with warm days and abundant rain fall,
between 6.6 </p>

<p>and 7.26 feet per annum, characterizes the Ayacucho area. Coca
is usually </p>

<p>grown on steep slopes which require terracing at an elevation
of between </p>

<p>1,650 and 4,290 feet. Soils in this area are red and high in
iron. </p>

<p>Bolivia </p>

<p>Bolivia is the world's second largest source of coca leaf.
There is both </p>

<p>licit and illicit coca cultivation occurring in this country
as well. In </p>

<p>mid-1988, a law became effective that made coca cultivation
illegal in most </p>

<p>of the country. The law also established legal, transitional,
and illegal </p>

<p>zones of cultivation and declared that 12,000 hectares of coca
would be the </p>

<p>amount grown to meet the traditional demand for coca. </p>

<p>There are roughly three main growing areas in Bolivia. The
three areas are </p>

<p>the Yungas de La Paz, the Chapare, and the Apolo. Coca
cultivation in the </p>

<p>Yungas de La Paz is located between the cities of Guanay and
Inquisivi, </p>

<p>northeast of La Paz on the eastern slope of the Andes.
Cultivation in the </p>

<p>Chapare occurs in the provinces of Carrasco, Chapare, and
Arani in the </p>

<p>department of Cochabamba, east of La Paz. The small area of
Apolo is in the </p>

<p>La Paz department north of the city of La Paz. </p>

<p>Nearly all the licit coca is grown in the traditional growing
areas of the </p>

<p>Yungas. The overwhelming amount of illicit coca is grown in
the Chapare where </p>

<p>it is estimated that about 75 percent of the country's coca
crop is </p>

<p>cultivated. The amount of coca grown in the Apolo is much less
than in either </p>

<p>of the two other areas. </p>

<p>Parts of the Yungas have been cultivated for hundreds of
years. Coca is </p>

<p>planted at between 4,800 and 6,000 feet in altitude on
terraced fields, </p>

<p>generally on steep slopes. Some of these fields have a slope
of more than 45 </p>

<p>degrees. The Yungas is characterized by a five-month rainy
season that runs </p>

<p>from December to April receiving about 4 feet of rainfall per
year, followed </p>

<p>by seven dry months. The soil content is poor, and this area
has suffered </p>

<p>severe erosion problems. </p>

<p>In the Chapare, the weather is continually wet and warm, with
an annual </p>

<p>rainfall averaging around 13 feet. The growing areas in this
region are </p>

<p>broad, low plains containing some hills. Coca is cultivated at
between 660 </p>

<p>and 1,650 feet above sea level where the temperature averages
around 57 </p>

<p>degrees Fahrenheit. The soil is clay based, rich alluvial
(sediment deposited </p>

<p>by flowing water). </p>

<p>The Apolo, located in La Paz department, is also a noteworthy
coca-growing </p>

<p>region of Bolivia. Coca in the Apolo region is often
interplanted with </p>

<p>coffee, a major crop in the area. Soil in the Apolo is not
suited very well </p>

<p>to coca; the longevity of a coca bush there is only from five
to eight years. </p>

<p>Coca plants in the Apolo are therefore constantly replaced. </p>

<p>Colombia </p>

<p>Colombia ranks third in worldwide coca leaf production with
all cultivation </p>

<p>being illicit. There is widespread cultivation in the eastern
plains region </p>

<p>of the Llanos which encompasses about one-half of Colombia.
The heaviest </p>

<p>areas of cultivation are located in the departments of
Putumayo, Caqueta, </p>

<p>Guaviare, and Vaupes. There is substantial expansion of the
coca crop in the </p>

<p>Bolivar department in the north-central area of Colombia as
well as areas of </p>

<p>cultivation in the south and southwest part of the country. </p>

<p>In the southern coca-growing region, the temperature averages
between 49.5 </p>

<p>and 52 degrees Fahrenheit and there is light rainfall. Coca is
normally grown </p>

<p>between 3,300 arid 6,600 feet above sea level. The soil in
this region is </p>

<p>iron rich; however, there is some erosion. </p>

<p>COCAINE PROCESSING </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaves to coca paste, cocaine base, and
cocaine </p>

<p>hydrochloride occurs primarily in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.
Peru and </p>

<p>Bolivia are the primary locations for the conversion of leaf
to coca paste </p>

<p>and cocaine base, while Colombia is the primary location for
the final </p>

<p>conversion to cocaine hydrochloride. It is believed that both
Peruvian and </p>

<p>Bolivian traffickers have begun increasing their production of
HCI in the </p>

<p>last few years. </p>

<p>There are a number of chemicals and solvents which play vital
roles in the </p>

<p>processing of coca leaves to paste, base and HCI. Many of
these chemicals are </p>

<p>quite common; all are theoretically substitutable and all have
legitimate </p>

<p>uses making them difficult to control. </p>

<p>Coca processing can be broken down into three stages. The
first is the </p>

<p>conversion of the coca leaf into coca paste; this is almost
always done very </p>

<p>close to the coca fields to cut down on the transport of the
coca leaves. The </p>

<p>second phase is the conversion of coca paste into cocaine
base. This step is </p>

<p>usually omitted in Colombia and the process is taken straight
through from </p>

<p>paste to cocaine HCI. The final stage is conversion of base to
HCI. </p>

<p>Coca Leaves to Coca Paste </p>

<p>The conversion of coca leaf into coca paste is accomplished in
a coca paste </p>

<p>pit, or &quot;pozo. &quot; A typical coca paste pit is a very
crude structure located </p>

<p>near the harvesting site and consists of only a very few
items. Some paste </p>

<p>pits have even been reported in peasants' houses. The paste
pit is usually a </p>

<p>hole in the ground, lined with thick, heavy plastic, or may
even be a </p>

<p>55-gallon drum with the top cut out. Paste pits are often
located near </p>

<p>streams so that the processors will have a constant supply of
fresh water, </p>

<p>which is used in the first stage of processing. The process of
converting </p>

<p>leaves to paste usually takes a few days. Often, however, the
leaves will be </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; or &quot;stomped&quot; for only a few hours
rendering less paste than if </p>

<p>&quot;worked&quot; for several days. It is apparently
sometimes more desirable to move </p>

<p>the paste out than to get more paste per kilogram of coca
leaf. Depending on </p>

<p>the size of the pit and the amount of leaf, the whole process
will require </p>

<p>the energy of two to five workers. </p>

<p>The following recipe for coca paste is but one of many.
Recipes will differ </p>

<p>depending on where the laboratory is located. Some will opt
not to use water </p>

<p>in the first step and amounts and mixing times vary widely.
However, this </p>

<p>remains a good benchmark formula. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca leaves are put in an above-ground container or in a
plastic lined </p>

<p>pit. An alkaline material (sodium carbonate) and water are
added to the </p>

<p>leaves. Here the alkaline material enables the cocaine
alkaloid present in </p>

<p>the leaf to be extracted into kerosene. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>A water immiscible solvent (kerosene) is added to water,
solution, and </p>

<p>leaves. The mixture is then agitated. Usually this is
accomplished by having </p>

<p>several people stomp on the leaves. The solvent acts to
extract water </p>

<p>insoluble cocaine alkaloids from the alkaline solution. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids and kerosene separate from water and leaves.
The water and </p>

<p>leaves are then drained off. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine alkaloids are extracted from the kerosene into a
dilute acid </p>

<p>solution. Alkaline material (sodium carbonate) is added to the
remaining </p>

<p>solution which causes a precipitate to form . The acid and the
water are </p>

<p>drained off and the precipitate is filtered and dried to
produce coca paste, </p>

<p>a chunky, off-white to light brown, putty-like </p>

<p>substance. </p>

<p>Coca Paste to Cocaine Base </p>

<p>The processing of coca paste into cocaine base is more
complicated than paste </p>

<p>production, requiring more sophisticated equipment and added
skills. Cocaine </p>

<p>base can be processed at the paste facility, but base
laboratories may be </p>

<p>located away from the cultivation zones. Usually the base
laboratories are </p>

<p>located near rivers or have a clandestine airstrip located in
the vicinity to </p>

<p>facilitate both the movement of coca paste into the base
laboratory, but also </p>

<p>the movement of cocaine base to cocaine HCl laboratories. </p>

<p>As with the paste recipes, the base recipes have many
versions. This one is </p>

<p>one of the more common and a continuation of the paste recipe.
</p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>The coca paste is added to sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid
and water. The </p>

<p>paste is dissolved into the acid solution. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Potassium permanganate is combined with water. This mixture is
added to the </p>

<p>coca paste and acid solution. Potassium permanganate is used
in this step to </p>

<p>extract other alkaloids and material that is undesired in the
final product. </p>

<p>In particular, potassium permanganate is used to break down
the alkaloid </p>

<p>ciscinnamoylcocaine found in large concentrations in E.
novogranatense </p>

<p>varieties. If the coca paste has a high concentration of this
alkaloid and </p>

<p>potassium permanganate is not used, then crystallization of
cocaine HCl will </p>

<p>be very difficult. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>This mixture is allowed to stand for about six hours. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>The solution is filtered and the precipitate is discarded.
Ammonia water is </p>

<p>added to the filtered solution and another precipitate is
formed. </p>

<p>--Step 5 </p>

<p>The liquid is drained from the solution and the remaining
precipitate is </p>

<p>usually dried with heating lamps. The resulting powder is
cocaine base. </p>

<p>It is common in Colombia to skip the base stage of cocaine
processing and go </p>

<p>right from coca paste to cocaine HCl. This can be accomplished
by eliminating </p>

<p>the last part of step number four in coca paste processing and
skipping to </p>

<p>step number two of the cocaine base phase where the coca paste
is added to </p>

<p>the potassium permanganate solution. </p>

<p>Cocaine Base to Cocaine Hydrochloride (HCl) </p>

<p>The final stage of cocaine processing requires even more skill
and equipment, </p>

<p>and is much more dangerous than the previously mentioned
steps. Unlike paste </p>

<p>and base processing, cocaine HCl processing calls for
expensive chemicals </p>

<p>that are harder to find and often not manufactured in the
processing country. </p>

<p>The HCl laboratory usually consists of several buildings
including </p>

<p>dormitories, eating facilities, an office, storage facilities,
and the </p>

<p>laboratory itself. Also usually found at HCl laboratories are
communications </p>

<p>operations, generators, filtering and drying equipment, and,
more recently, </p>

<p>chemical recycling facilities. The HCl laboratory will
sometimes have direct </p>

<p>access to an airstrip. </p>

<p>The following recipe is a continuation of the above two. At
this point the </p>

<p>methods of processing vary only slightly. </p>

<p>--Step 1 </p>

<p>Acetone or ether is added to dissolve the cocaine base and the
solution is </p>

<p>filtered to remove undesired material. </p>

<p>--Step 2 </p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid diluted in acetone or ether is added to the
cocaine </p>

<p>solution. The addition of the hydrochloric acid causes the
cocaine to </p>

<p>precipitate (crystallize) out of the solution as cocaine
hydrochloride. </p>

<p>--Step 3 </p>

<p>The remaining acetone/ether solvent can be discarded or
reused. </p>

<p>--Step 4 </p>

<p>Cocaine HCl is dried under heat lamps, laid out to dry with
the aid of fans, </p>

<p>or dried in microwave ovens. </p>

<p>NATURAL ENEMIES AND ERADICATION EFFORTS </p>

<p>Although the coca bush is a very strong plant and will live
for many years </p>

<p>and produce many harvests of leaf, it will do better if taken
care of, </p>

<p>fertilized, and treated with herbicides and insecticides. </p>

<p>Occasionally, a coca field will become infested with one of
the plant's </p>

<p>natural enemies. The main pests and the effect that they are
known to have on </p>

<p>the plant are discussed below. </p>

<p>The larvae of the moth Eloria Noyesi presents the most serious
threat to the </p>

<p>coca plant. This moth lives through out the coca-growing
region of South </p>

<p>America and seems to feed almost exclusively on E. coca. It
has also been </p>

<p>recorded feeding on E. novogranatense in Colombia and northern
Peru. The </p>

<p>larva will develop in about a month and will eat up to 50
leaves in its </p>

<p>lifetime. The larva will also eat the shoots of the bush that
grow out after </p>

<p>harvest. If Eloria attacks a plant repeatedly, even a strong
plant will die. </p>

<p>The moth is usually only abundant from December to April. Coca
growers are </p>

<p>using insecticides to eradicate Eloria. </p>

<p>The larvae of Eucleodora Coca, a fly, seems to cause harm only
to Trujillo </p>

<p>coca. (There have been major infestations of this insect in
the past usually </p>

<p>occuring from April to August.) The larvae spend their entire
lives on the </p>

<p>plant, feeding on the leaves and shoots . As with the Eloria,
Eucleodora is </p>

<p>being controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Very little is known about the effect of the leaf-cutting ant,
Acromyrmex, on </p>

<p>coca. Growers in the Upper Huallaga Valley report that serious
damage in the </p>

<p>past has been done to their coca cultivation. The damage is
often controlled </p>

<p>with the use of insecticides and flooding. The beetle,
Aegoidus Pacificus, </p>

<p>also poses a threat to Trujillo coca. The adult beetle lays
her eggs in the </p>

<p>bark of the coca plant, and the larva later burrows into the
stem of the </p>

<p>plant. This usually results in an infestation of pathogenic
fungi which is </p>

<p>ultimately responsible for the death of the coca plant. As
with the other </p>

<p>pests, the beetle can also be controlled with insecticides. </p>

<p>Most of the other insects which attack coca only do so when
there are </p>

<p>shortages of their normal food supply. Some scientists believe
that cocaine </p>

<p>and other alkaloids may present some natural defense against
most pests. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, sometimes insects such as spider mites,
grasshoppers, </p>

<p>leafhoppers, and beetles find it necessary to eat coca. </p>

<p>The coca plant is also susceptible to numerous species of
pathogenic fungi. </p>

<p>Fungi seem to present the greatest threat to a plant during
the wet season. </p>

<p>The most serious threat seems to come from a fungus called
&quot;witches broom .&quot; </p>

<p>The exact effect of this fungus on the coca plant is not clear
because of the </p>

<p>limited amount of study which has been done on this fungus
infesting coca </p>

<p>plantations. </p>

<p>Natural enemies hold hope for control of the coca plant in the
future. At </p>

<p>present, however, the most successful methods in controlling
the growth of </p>

<p>coca are herbicides and manual eradication. </p>

<p>As of early 1990, all eradication of the coca plant in Bolivia
and Colombia </p>

<p>was being done manually. The usual method has been for a team
of eradication </p>

<p>workers to go into a field and pull up the bushes plant by
plant. In Peru, </p>

<p>manual eradication of coca is often suspended because of
security reasons. </p>

<p>Prior to that time, a number of gasoline-powered cutters had
been supplied to </p>

<p>the workers making it easier and much quicker to cut the coca.
The problem </p>

<p>with this method is that sometimes the coca bush will sprout
from the stump </p>

<p>within 12 to 18 months. As such, the cutting must be made very
close to the </p>

<p>ground to insure that the plant does not sprout again. </p>

<p>A number of herbicides have been tested for use in eradicating
the coca plant </p>

<p>including hexazinone and tebuthiuron (spike) . Application of
both has been </p>

<p>deemed successful in killing the plant as long as they are
applied in the </p>

<p>correct manner and amount. Within ten to twenty days after
application of </p>

<p>hexazinone or tebuthiuron the coca bush sheds all its leaves
and usually </p>

<p>within 60 to 90 days the coca plant will be completely dead. </p>

<p>The United States is working with some South American
governments to develop </p>

<p>an herbicidal eradication program; Bolivia, however, has
prohibited the use </p>

<p>of herbicides for this purpose. </p>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee: I'm pleased to appear
before you today to discuss the growing role of international
drug trafficking organizations operating in Mexico and to tell
you what the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is doing to
attack these organizations that are responsible for smuggling
tons of illegal drugs across the U.S./Mexico border. <br>
<br>
Mexico is pivotal to the success of any U.S. drug strategy. Not
only do we share a common border, through which three-fourths of
the cocaine enters our country, but Mexico has long been a major
source country for heroin and marijuana. Within the last few
years, it has also become a major source country for
methamphetamine, as well as a transit country for chemicals,
especially ephedrine, used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.
<br>
<br>
My purpose at this hearing today is to talk about the drug
trafficking situation and to highlight our concerns about the
increased role of these international drug gangs operating in
Mexico. My comments will be limited to observations on
trafficking organizations and their methods of smuggling, the law
enforcement communities' efforts to work with Mexico, and an
assessment of our chances for success in decreasing the flood of
illegal drugs that enter this country each day and have a
devastating impact on the citizens on both sides of the border. <br>
<br>
<strong>A Glimpse of the Problem</strong> <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, an important 1989 drug seizure gave us a glimpse of
the magnitude of the problem law enforcement faces and also
illustrates just how important Mexico is to our efforts to
control illegal drugs coming into our country. In late 1989, DEA
made America's largest cocaine seizure on record (over 21.5 tons)
in Sylmar, California. <br>
<br>
This cocaine came across the border at El Paso and was trucked to
the West Coast. Drug law enforcement was encouraged by such a
huge seizure, and we were convinced that we had seriously wounded
the Colombian drug organizations by preventing such a large
amount of illegal drugs from reaching our streets. <br>
<br>
But, we realized our encouragement was premature when we analyzed
seized records. What we found was even more astounding. We
learned that during only a 3-month period, the organization had
succeeded in smuggling 55 tons of cocaine into the U.S. This
cocaine had been trucked to Los Angeles and had already been
distributed on our streets. <br>
<br>
One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is that ten years
ago, we measured drug seizures in grams and pounds. Today, we
routinely measure seizures in tons-even multitons. In January,
for example, in Pasadena, Texas, a suburb of Houston, we seized
6.5 tons of cocaine. In July, we seized over 5 tons of cocaine in
the border town of El Paso. And one of the primary reasons for
these multiton shipments of cocaine is the efficient and
mutually-rewarding relationship that has emerged between the
cocaine mafia in Colombia and the drug trafficking groups
operating in Mexico. <br>
<br>
In fact, Mr. Chairman, we estimate that the Colombian drug mafia
is using Mexico as a cocaine safe haven to store, at any one
time, as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine that will eventually
be smuggled across the U.S. border for distribution on American
streets. This is enough to provide a line of cocaine to every
man, woman, and child on this planet--and then some. At a
conservative estimate, this cocaine would be worth over $700
million to $1 billion on America's streets. <br>
<br>
<strong>Role of the International Drug Traffickers</strong> <br>
<br>
The fact that these traffickers have been able to accommodate the
transportation needs of the Cali cocaine mafia is not something
that happened overnight. Criminal organizations from Mexico have
had decades of practice. Traditionally, the Mexican border
economies have been significantly affected by the smuggling
activities into and out of the United States. It was these
organized smuggling organizations that rose to prominence in the
late 1960s and 1970s when marijuana trafficking presented the
potential for huge profits. <br>
<br>
During the early 1980's, most of the Colombian cocaine entered
the United States through South Florida by way of the Caribbean.
But, traffickers were forced to find new routes when U.S. drug
agencies increased enforcement action in the Caribbean and South
Florida. The Colombian drug lords naturally turned to the
trafficking groups in Mexico which had what they were looking
for: proximity to the United States, a 2,000 mile expanse of
border offering unlimited smuggling possibilities, and an already
established drug trafficking infrastructure that stood ready to
serve their needs. <br>
<br>
The drug trafficking organizations easily adapted their
operations to include cocaine trafficking, and by the mid-80's,
were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian
cocaine. Delegating cocaine transportation to the traffickers in
Mexico was a tactical decision on the part of the Cali mafia.
With the transportation assistance of these traffickers, the
cocaine barons could now move larger bulk quantities through
Mexico which would have been logistically impossible to move by
any other means. By turning the riskiest part of the cocaine
distribution cycle (the transportation) over to these
traffickers, the Cali mafia could turn its attention to other
aspects of their cocaine enterprise. This drug trafficking
partnership has become one of both convenience and profit. <br>
<br>
One of the first traffickers to move cocaine through Mexico and
to the U.S. was Juan Ramon Matta-Ballesteros, a Honduran, who,
from the mid-'70s to the mid-'80s, was actively involved with the
Mexican Guadalajara Cartel. This was the group responsible for
the kidnapping torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique
(Kiki) Camarena in 1985. The death of Agent Camarena outraged the
American public. Matta-Ballesteros has been convicted in three
separate U.S. cases and is serving a term of life imprisonment. <br>
<br>
<strong>Emerging Traffickers Coming into their Own</strong> <br>
<br>
Today, there is no question that drug traffickers operating in
Mexico have become major players in the international drug trade.
These veteran traffickers have been good students and have
learned valuable lessons from the drug experts--the Cali mafia.
They have seen the benefit (and profits) of working together in a
partnership to provide a needed transportation service to the
cocaine organizations in Colombia. Receiving payment in both cash
and cocaine, they have begun to establish their own cocaine
distribution networks and territories, stretching from the
Southwest border areas as far as New York. In effect, the Cali
mafia has been a willing partner in helping these organizations
create distribution and sales networks in the U.S. <br>
<br>
Like the Cali mafia, these trafficking organizations have
demonstrated their flexibility to change trafficking routes when
law enforcement action along any one route becomes too risky to
their business. These drug groups have also followed the lead of
their predecessors by expanding and diversifying their product
line. Sophisticated trafficking organizations based in Mexico now
manufacture methamphetamine and smuggle the precursor chemicals
necessary for its manufacture. And, perhaps most important, as
they have expanded their role in the drug trade, they have made
valuable worldwide contacts, which will be necessary as they
continue to establish themselves as important players in the
world of illegal drugs. <br>
<br>
There are a number of trafficking groups in Mexico that have
gained a firm foothold in the trafficking of drugs, but I'd like
to take a moment to describe the four major drug trafficking
organizations that work closely with the Cali mafia: <br>
<br>
<strong>Tijuana Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
The organization sometimes referred to the &quot;Tijuana
Cartel,&quot; is headed by Benjamin Arellano-Felix and his
brother Francisco. They control most of the drugs crossing the
border on the West Coast between Tijuana and Mexicali. <br>
<br>
Feuding between this group and other organizations has become
increasingly violent. In fact, it was the feuding between the
Arrellano-Felix organization and rival drug dealers that led to
the killing of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas-Ocampo at the
Guadalajara airport in 1993 <br>
<br>
The Arellano-Felix brothers are currently the subjects of a
nationwide manhunt by law enforcement authorities for their
involvement in the Cardinal's killing. On June 23, Mexican
authorities arrested Hector Luis Palma-Salazar, the leader of a
rival drug organization that is believed to be behind the
attempted assassinations of the Arellano-Felix brothers, as well
as the murder of Cardinal Posadas-Ocampo. Benjamin and Francisco
Arellano-Felix have both been indicted in San Diego, California,
and are DEA fugitives. <br>
<br>
<strong>The Caro-Ouintero Organization</strong> <br>
<br>
The Caro-Quintero organization is involved in the cultivation,
processing, smuggling and distribution of heroin and marijuana
and the transportation of Colombian cocaine into the U.S. This
organization was previously led by Rafael Caro-Quintero, known as
the &quot;Mexican Rhinestone Cowboy,&quot; who began his criminal
career at the young age of 12 or 13 as an apprentice to Pedro
Aviles, a notorious Mexican drug trafficker. <br>
<br>
Caro-Quintero is currently in a Mexican maximum security prison
for his involvement in the kidnaping, torture and murder of DEA
Special Agent Enrique Camarena, as well as for marijuana and
cocaine trafficking. His brother, Miguel Caro-Quintero, now runs
the organization, and is under indictment in Tucson and Denver. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juarez: Cartel</strong> <br>
<br>
One of the most notorious and powerful of these trafficking
organizations is the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization,
sometimes referred to as the &quot;Juarez Cartel.&quot;
Carrillo-Fuentes has been the chief transporter for the recently
arrested Cali mafia leader Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela. <br>
<br>
Carrillo-Fuentes owns several airline companies, which enables
him to fly 727s from Colombia into Juarez, where he runs his
organization from his ranch headquarters. Increasingly, murders
in Juarez have been associated with Carrillo-Fuentes. In July,
the leader of the juvenile gangs he recruits to smuggle drugs
across the border was found shot 23 times in the head. Here in
the United States, Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in Miami on
heroin and marijuana charges, and in Dallas on cocaine charges. <br>
<br>
<strong>Juan Garcia-Abrego</strong> <br>
<br>
Another influential Mexican trafficker acting in concert with the
Cali mafia is Juan Garcia-Abrego, who is involved in smuggling
drugs from the Yucatan area in Mexico to South Texas and up to
New York. Juan Garcia-Abrego was recently added to the FBI's top
ten most wanted fugitives, with a $2 million reward for his
capture. This is the first time an international drug trafficker
has been included on the FBI list. <br>
<br>
This organization transports large quantities of cocaine for the
Cali mafia, as well as marijuana and heroin for other
traffickers. Garcia-Abrego pioneered deals in which Mexican
traffickers take payment in cocaine, which substantially raised
their profits, and at the same time diversified their involvement
from beyond smuggling to the role of suppliers to their own drug
distribution networks. He and his organization are notorious for
the violence they employ to further and protect their illicit
trade. <br>
<br>
He also ships bulk amounts of cash for the Cali mafia. During a
four-year period, from 1989 to 1993, $53 million was seized in
connection with the Garcia-Abrego organization. Two American
Express bankers in Brownsville, Texas, were indicted for
laundering $30 million for Garcia-Abrego, and to date, 70 members
of his organization have been prosecuted and convicted in the
U.S. Juan Garcia-Abrego has been indicted in Houston and remains
a fugitive. <br>
<br>
<strong>Expanding Influence: Cocaine and Methamphetamine</strong>
<br>
<br>
DEA is very concerned about the expanding role of drug
organizations based in Mexico which are playing an increasingly
larger role in the shipment and distribution of cocaine and
methamphetamine to the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cocaine</strong> <br>
<br>
In the last few years, we've seen international trafficking
organizations make major changes in their efficiency in
transporting bulk shipments of cocaine to transporting
organizations in Mexico. Traditionally trafficking organizations
used twin-engine general aviation aircraft to transport cocaine
from Colombia to transhipment locations in Mexico and the
Caribbean. Today, however, the Cali mafia has bought passenger
jets (like 727's) gutted them, and are using them to transport
multiton loads of cocaine to the trafficking organizations in
Mexico. In March of this year, for example, a Caravelle jet
aircraft was seized in the Mexican State of Sonora, after being
abandoned by traffickers when its tires became stuck in the dirt
runway. Mexican Government forces later seized 2.8 tons of
cocaine that are believed to have been off-loaded from that
Caravelle. <br>
<br>
Law enforcement has also uncovered two tunnels built to move
cocaine from Mexico into the United States. The first was
discovered in Arizona in 1990. The second nearly-completed tunnel
was discovered in 1993 near the Tijuana Airport and led to an
unfinished warehouse in the United States. <br>
<br>
<strong>Methamphetamine</strong> <br>
<br>
U.S. law enforcement is also concerned about the growing role of
trafficking gangs operating in Mexico involved in the
methamphetamine trade. We directly attribute the increased
amounts of methamphetamine available in the U.S. to these
trafficking organizations which have replaced domestic outlaw
motorcycle gangs as the predominant methamphetamine producers,
traffickers, and distributors. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, DEA is very much aware of the problem of these
methamphetamine gangs operating in the U.S. Last summer, DEA
Special Agent Richard Fass was shot and killed in Tucson by a
methamphetamine trafficker during an undercover operation. The
ring leader of the gang responsible for Agent Fass' death has
still not been apprehended and is believed to be in Mexico. The
DEA is currently working with both the FBI and Mexican
authorities to apprehend him. <br>
<br>
In the last three years, these trafficking organizations have
virtually saturated the western United States market with
high-purity methamphetamine, known also as &quot;speed&quot;
or&quot;crank.&quot; In some areas of California, it has now
reportedly replaced cocaine as the drug of choice. With a
saturated West Coast market, these traffickers have begun to
expand their markets to the East Coast and in the South. DEA's
southern offices report a growing presence of these trafficking
groups providing methamphetamine to domestic trafficking
organizations in rural and suburban areas of Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, and the Carolinas. <br>
<br>
As supplies have increased, prices have fallen, making it a cheap
alternative to cocaine. Some have called it the &quot;poor man's
cocaine.&quot; In 1991, for example, the lowest pound price
nationwide was $6,000. Today, in California, methamphetamine
sells for between $2,500 and $3,600 per pound. <br>
<br>
With increased availability, methamphamine use has increased.
According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network, the number of
emergency room episodes involving methamphetamine has increased
steadily since 1991, particularly in the West. From 1991 to 1993,
episodes more than doubled in both Los Angeles and Phoenix. <br>
<br>
The dominance of Mexico-based, poly-drug organizations in
methamphetamine trafficking is further evidence of their growing
sophistication. The smuggling skills developed while transporting
cocaine for the Cali mafia has enabled these organizations to
branch out into moving other contraband, such as precursor
chemicals, especially ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used in the
manufacture of methamphetamine . <br>
<br>
They have established international connections in Europe, Asia
and the Far East to obtain the shipment of tons of precursor
chemicals, particularly ephedrine, to addresses in both United
States and Mexico. During 1993 and 1994, the majority of
ephedrine shipments destined for Mexico were supplied by such
diverse countries as China, India, the Czech Republic, and
Switzerland. From mid-1993 to early 1995, DEA documented the
diversion of almost 170 tons of ephedrine used in illicit
methamphetamine production. It's important to note, however, that
DEA has obtained cooperation from many of these countries to stem
the flow of chemicals going to Mexico. <br>
<br>
It's difficult to predict where this newest surge of
methamphetamine use and trafficking will lead, but we must not
assume that it has peaked. Unlike other drugs, methamphetamine is
one that these criminal organizations can control entirely from
beginning to end. They have the international contacts to obtain
the necessary precursor chemicals to make the drug. They have the
clandestine labs to process the chemicals into methamphetamine on
both sides of the border. They have expanded their distribution
networks across the nation by the use and intimidation of illegal
aliens. And, unlike their previous role as middle-men moving
cocaine and heroin, they can keep 100 percent of the profits from
their methamphetamine sales. <br>
<br>
U. S. law enforcement may be in for a difficult and violent few
years as we work to get the methamphetamine problem under
control. We've already seen &quot;meth&quot; smuggling gangs face
off against each other. Recently, in San Diego, a confrontation
between meth smuggling groups with ties to Mexico resulted in 26
homicides. There may be more bloodshed on our streets, as these
drug gangs fight to protect (and expand) their drug turf. <br>
<br>
<strong>DEA's Response</strong> <br>
<br>
In response to the threats of the Mexico-based trafficking
organizations and their surrogate drug gangs operating here in
the United States, DEA has taken a number of steps to work with
our law enforcement partners in Mexico, as well as with our
Federal, state, and local colleagues here at home. <br>
<br>
DEA has joined forces with the FBI in a Southwest Border
Initiative that targets the major Mexican trafficking
organizations for enforcement actions. Combined teams of state,
local and federal law enforcement led by DEA and FBI Special
Agents are working together with a common goal of disrupting
these gangs and bringing their leaders to justice. <br>
<br>
For the first time, the DEA, the FBI, the Department of Justice
Criminal Division, and respective U.S. Attorneys in every state
along the Southwest Border are coordinating both intelligence and
manpower resources against a common enemy--the poly-drug
trafficking organizations that are transporting increased amounts
of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine across our
borders. Both the DEA and the FBI hold high expectations for the
success for this operation. <br>
<br>
Three new binational Border Task Forces have been established and
will focus on the four principal trafficking organizations.
Senior personnel of the DEA, FBI, and DOJ Criminal Division serve
on a U.S./Mexican Plenary Group, working to enhance our
cooperation against narcotics, money laundering, arms smuggling,
and other crimes. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in this open forum I cannot explain the specifics
of how this new initiative will work, but I would be happy to
discuss this in more detail in a closed session or a private
briefing. <br>
<br>
Our support for Mexico's drug fighting efforts is critical to
their success--and ultimately to our own. Attorney General Reno
and Mexican Attorney General Antonio Lozano-Gracia have pledged
to work cooperatively to address the problems. Hopefully, a close
and coordinated law enforcement response by our two countries
will have an impact on this growing problem. <br>
<br>
<strong>Future Threats: An Assessment</strong> <br>
<br>
There is no question that the international drug trafficking
organizations operating in Colombia and Mexico have had a direct
impact on the multiton quantities of cocaine law enforcement is
forced to deal with today. These organizations have proven to be
a serious threat to both the United States and Mexico. <br>
<br>
In recent years, as the political and economic ties between the
United States and Mexico have strengthened, a new generation of
international traffickers have been able to carve out an ever
larger share of the world's drug trade and pose a growing threat
on both sides of the border. We've seen these trafficking
organizations grow from low-level smuggling groups to
sophisticated organizations that smuggle more and more drugs of
every kind--cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and now
methamphetamine--into the U.S. They are increasingly being paid
for their transportation expertise with cocaine, a move that
could prove to be the undoing of the Cali mafia and could shift
the balance of power within the worldwide cocaine trade. <br>
<br>
Mr. Chairman, in a few years down the road, I believe it's
entirely possible that these newly emerging groups could rise to
an equal (or superior) footing with the Cali mafia. If this
happens, life as we know it in both the United States and Mexico
will change dramatically. They care little for the devasting
impact they have on the people of Mexico and the United States.
They are international criminal elements that must be dealt with.
<br>
<br>
The President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, has publically stated
to the American media that drug trafficking is a threat to
Mexican national security, not only because of the crime that is
inherent in such activity, but also because of the growing wealth
that enables traffickers to corrupt police and government
institutions. <br>
<br>
As these organizations grow in wealth and sophistication, they
threaten to overwhelm the capabilities of any law enforcement
system, including Mexico. By comparison, we have a professional
law enforcement system in the United States, at the Federal,
state and local level, that promotes and encourages high
standards in recruitment, training, internal inspections,
standards of operations and accountability to electecl officials.
<br>
<br>
We have a criminal justice system that is quick to respond to
charges of unethical or corrupt actions on the part of law
enforcement. It has helped to professionalize our law enforcement
agencies and insure a continuing quest for ethics and integrity.
Despite our best efforts, unethical or illegal activities do
occasionally occur within the ranks of our law enforcement
agencies, requiring swift and decisive government action to
preserve the public's faith and trust. <br>
<br>
As a society, we provide modern and sophisticated resources to
our law enforcement agencies to combat the criminal elements
confronting them. The law enforcement institutions in Mexico do
not presently have an infrastructure similar to those in the U.S.
The development of such institutions will require a substantial
commitment of time and resources to achieve the necessary level
of professionalism. The potential exists that if this is not
done, they may be overwhelmed by the wealth and influence of the
drug organizations. <br>
<br>
We are not alone in recognizing this problem. Attorney General
Lozano has moved to have special police units report directly to
him. He has announced a plan to include reviews of all Federal
police officers and prosecutors, with mandatory drug testing, to
combat internal corruption. I cite this only to illustrate that
the Mexican government itself recognizes this is a problem. <br>
<br>
It is imperative that we work with our partners in Mexico to
blunt the influence these drug traffickers are having in both our
countries. It is also imperative that our own Federal, state, and
local law enforcement continue to work cooperatively together to
make the best use of our resources, as well as to increase our
impact on these trafficking organizations. Surely, when we speak
of tons of drugs coming across our borders and causing tremendous
damage to the health and well-being of our citizens, we are
talking of a national security threat that demands our immediate
and continuous attention. <br>
<br>
DEA is hopeful that future counterdrug efforts with Mexico will
be successful. In the past year, Mexico has instituted new
programs that include attempts to professionalize its law
enforcement institutions and increase cross-border cooperation to
address the threat of the international traffickers. The direct
and cooperative communication between Attorney General Reno and
Attorney General Lozano should be of great help in securing a
coordination of our resources to address a common problem. The
threat is serious--and it is real. <br>
