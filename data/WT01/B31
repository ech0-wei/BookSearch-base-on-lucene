<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Data and Analysis Requirements for Policy
Toward Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>By Mark Kleiman. Submitted: November 1985. Mark Kleiman is a
Research Fellow in the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and
Management at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard
University, Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the
University of Rochester, and President of BOTEC Analysis
Corporation. </p>

<p>Executive Summary </p>

<p>Organized crime control and drug enforcement need to be
considered together insofar as drug trafficking contributes to
the organized crime problem or organized crime contributes to the
drug problem. In making policy it would be useful to know about
(1) the role of drug trafficking in supporting organized crime
groups; (2) the role of organized crime groups in supplying
drugs; and (3) the effects on each problem of changing
enforcement practices in the other. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States. </p>

<p>Both &quot;traditionally&quot; organized crime groups (Mafia
families) and &quot;emerging&quot; organized crime groups
participate in some aspects of the illicit drug trafficking
industry. In addition, some drug trafficking organizations have
some of the characteristics of organized crime groups, such as
the capacity and reputation for the use of violence and
corruption to frustrate enforcement. </p>

<p>Organized crime can participate in drug markets either
&quot;productively,&quot; using its lawbreaking skills to
contribute to the supply of illicit drugs, or
&quot;parasitically,&quot; using violence and the threat of
violence to extort drug merchants or organize cartels. Only the
productive activity of organized crime contributes to the drug
supply problem, which is the main target of drug enforcement.
Parasitic organized crime activity, in illicit markets as in
legitimate markets, tends to raise prices and reduce consumption.
</p>

<p>Controlling organized crime and controlling drug abuse (and
drug-abuse-related crime) are two distinct objectives. Some
agencies of government - the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), for
example - have primary responsibility for drug abuse control.
Others, like the Organized Crime Strike Forces, are concerned
primarily with organized crime control. The two sets of agencies
may or may not promote each other's objectives. </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions may affect the drug markets in
several ways. They may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of organized
crime to participate in and profit from drug dealing; (2)
encourage or retard the development of organized-crime-like
characteristics among drug trafficking groups; and (3) lead to
more or fewer convictions of organized criminals. Unless it is
deliberately focused on organized crime groups, high-level drug
enforcement may tend to foster organized crime by keeping prices
high and driving out less well-organized competitors. </p>

<p>Organized crime enforcement actions may make the task of drug
enforcement harder or easier, depending on whether the roles of
those groups in the drug markets are primarily parasitic or
primarily productive. Aside from heroin importation into New
York, traditional organized crime is largely a parasite on the
drug markets; thus, as long as the organized crime effort
concentrates on the Mafia, it has little to contribute to drug
supply reduction. </p>

<p>Data about drug trafficking and drug enforcement, and about
the relationships between the drug trade and organized crime, can
serve three purposes: describing the current dimensions of the
problem, reasoning about how changes in enforcement activity
might make matters better or worse, and measuring the actual
effects of such changes after they are made. </p>

<p>From the perspective of organized crime policy, essential
facts about the drug markets are prices and quantities, and, most
important, the relationship between changes in retail price and
changes in the quantity purchased: the price-elasticity of
demand. Driving up the price of an inelastically-demanded drug
will increase the total revenues of traffickers of that drug, and
thus tend to promote organized crime. </p>

<p>Data about the drug markets and drug enforcement come from
three sources: (1) survey research; (2) observations of the
consequences of drug abuse (deaths, injuries, and demand for
treatment); and (3) enforcement statistics and reports. </p>

<p>Current large survey efforts, among households and high-school
seniors, do not gather much price and quantity data. We need a
separate national survey with a sample designed to overrepresent
heavy drug-users, that ask very detailed questions about price,
quantity, and conditions of drug purchase. In addition, local and
regional surveys should be conducted to evaluate the effect of
enforcement initiatives on market conditions and drug
consumption. </p>

<p>Two techniques not now in use - &quot;panel&quot; surveys of
drug users and surveys of convicted dealers - should be
undertaken, if the difficult operational and ethical issues can
be resolved. </p>

<p>Neither abuse-consequence data now gathered (medical examiner
and emergency-room reports through the Drug Abuse Warning Network
(DAWN), drug abuse treatment data through the remnants of the
Client-Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP), opinions of
treatment professionals through the Community Epidemiology Work
Group (CEWG)) nor alternative ways of reaching the same facts are
very useful in making organized crime/drug enforcement policy
choices. These programs serve other purposes and should not be
disturbed, except for adding bioassay capability to some DAWN
sites. Pilot programs to test jail admittees for heroin use are
worth pursuing. </p>

<p>More could be done with enforcement agency data, which could
tell us about the enforcement effort itself (agency activities,
targets, measured results) and on its effects (prices at
different levels of the drug trade). The new management of the
Drug Enforcement Administration has put less effort into
estimating prices and quantities in the drug markets. That change
should be reversed, and DEA should again publish price-chain
estimates. </p>

<p>Enforcement agencies can also make and analyze retail-level
drug purchases, unrelated to specific cases, to measure the state
of the drug markets. Such &quot;monitor&quot; programs should be
increased in frequency, systematized, and applied to marijuana
and cocaine as well as heroin. </p>

<p>Recent revisions in the methods used by the National Narcotics
Intelligence Consumers Committee (NNICC) in preparing the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate (NIE) appear to have somewhat
reduced that document's inconsistencies with observable fact.
However, the NNICC still seems to practice analysis by
negotiation rather than basing its estimates on evidence. The NIE
would be more useful if its assumptions, data, and computations
were explicit. There might be value in allowing a group of
experts outside the government access to NNICC documents and
sources, from which they could develop an independent set of
estimates. </p>

<p>Questions to be Answered: </p>

<p>Drug trafficking and organized crime are linked problems.
Policy making and evaluation for each is complicated by the
presence of the other. My objective is to outline a set of data
collection and analysis activities that would answer questions
under four headings: </p>

<p>1. What effects do organized crime have on drug trafficking
and enforcement? </p>

<p>2. What effects do drug trafficking and enforcement have on
organized crime? </p>

<p>3. How should federal agencies engaged in organized crime
enforcement adjust their policies to contribute to the objectives
of drug policy? </p>

<p>4. How should federal agencies engaged in drug enforcement
adjust their policies to contribute to the objective of organized
crime control? </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis are never free; in the drug area,
they are likely to be quite expensive. It is therefore important
to identify in advance what is relatively certain on the basis of
information and analysis now in hand; it doesn't take a
spectroscopic analysis to discover that the sky is blue. The
following section will therefore attempt to describe what we now
know and to identify the key analytic points. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Enforcement and Organized Crime Control </p>

<p>How Two Objectives and Two Sets of Institutions Intersect </p>

<p>The objective of drug enforcement is to keep drugs away from
consumers. The objective of organized crime enforcement is to
control the wealth and power of major criminal organizations and
to frustrate their goal of being able to defy the law. </p>

<p>These objectives interact where the illicit drug business is a
major source of power or revenue to organized crime groups (or a
major source of their vulnerability to enforcement), and where
the capabilities of organized crime groups make drugs more
available than they would otherwise be: in other words, where the
drug trade contributes to the organized crime problem or where
organized crime contributes to the drug problem. </p>

<p>Defining Organized Crime </p>

<p>The term organized crime can be used in one of two ways. It
may be merely an ethnically neutral euphemism for &quot;the
Mafia&quot; or &quot;La Cosa Nostra&quot; (LCN); or it may
describe a class of criminal organizations whose characteristics
make them particularly worthy of law enforcement attention. Size,
wealth, political power, participation in a variety of criminal
activities, and continuity over time have all been suggested as
such characteristics. </p>

<p>One way to bridge the gap between the two definitional
approaches is to refer to the Mafia as &quot;traditional&quot;
organized crime, while acknowledging the existence of other,
&quot;emerging,&quot; organized crime groups. </p>

<p>Defining organized crime in terms of its characteristics,
rather than ostensibly, complicates the analysis. Not only does
this approach treat the set of &quot;organized crime&quot; groups
as variable rather than fixed; it also implies a many-valued
rather than two-valued classification. Criminal groups, rather
than simply being organized crime or non-organized crime (i.e.,
Mafia families or other), will fall along a spectrum of being
more or less &quot;organized-crime-like.&quot; This suggests the
possibility that drug enforcement activity can increase or
decrease the number of drug-dealing organizations with many
organized crime characteristics. It also suggests that it can
make existing organized-crime-like drug dealers more or less
organized-crime-like and give such groups a greater or lesser
share of the drug market. </p>

<p>This paper will attempt to distinguish between traditional and
emerging organized crime groups, but will think of organized
crime as primarily a set of organizational characteristics rather
than a predefined set of organizations. The relevant
characteristics are organizational continuity and organizational
investment in the capability and reputation for violent or
corrupt interference with law enforcement activity. </p>

<p>Organized Crime as a Drug Supply Problem </p>

<p>&quot;Traditional&quot; organized crime - La Cosa Nostra -
does not now contribute substantially to the drug problem, with
the exception of the major roles of two of the five New York LCN
&quot;families&quot; in heroin importation. This is not to say
that LCN members and associates do not participate in drug
dealing on many levels, but only that they make no distinctive
contribution to the supply of illicit drugs. Indeed, as Thomas
Schelling has pointed out, the activity of organized crime in
cartel formation and extortion from illicit entrepreneurs may on
balance reduce the supply and increase the price of illicit
goods, as is true in licit markets. </p>

<p>As a consequence, organized crime enforcement institutions -
the Strike Forces and the investigators who work with them - have
relatively little to contribute to solving the problem of illicit
drug supply, as long as they continue their concentration on
&quot;traditional&quot; organized crime groups. This
concentration has been so successful, both in terms of successful
cases and in terms of creating and maintaining productive,
high-morale enforcement and prosecution institutions, that it
seems both unlikely (as a matter of prediction) to be changed and
unwise (as a matter of policy analysis) to consider changing. </p>

<p>It may be the case that some &quot;emerging&quot; organized
crime groups make distinctive contributions to various parts of
drug supply, so that their disruption would contribute to drug
supply control (over and above the general effect of enforcement
in raising prices by raising the costs and risks of drug
trafficking). Outlaw motorcycle gangs - the Hell's Angels in the
West, the Outlaws in the Mid-Atlantic region - may be
&quot;least-cost suppliers&quot; in the distribution of cocaine,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). Similarly, some
ethnic-based organizations among Asian-Americans may be
significant contributors to the heroin supply, as the Herrera
organization certainly was at least until the recent arrests. By
contrast, neither the importation nor the distribution of
marijuana appears to offer the economies of organization that
would make breaking up particular trafficking groups a major
marijuana enforcement objective. The marijuana trade may be at
its most efficient as a decentralized set of independent buyers
and sellers. </p>

<p>To develop a set of institutions to appropriately address the
role of emerging organized crime groups in the drug markets will
require devising organizational incentives and career patterns
that support extremely long-term investigations and investments
in intelligence (broadly defined), while maintaining a
supply-control orientation among agents and prosecutors. This
will not be an easy task. There may be lessons to be learned from
the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in its approach to LCN heroin
dealing. </p>

<p>The Drug Markets as an Organized Crime Problem </p>

<p>The illicit drug traffic contributes to the organized crime
problem because of the enormous amounts of money at stake. These
potential revenues will both attract (and help to sustain)
existing organized crime groups and call into existence new
groups with organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>LCN families, other ethnically-based organizations long in
existence, and outlaw motorcycle gangs may engage in drug dealing
as a way to support themselves financially and to take advantage
of their organizational abilities in illicit transactions. The
opportunities in the drug trade may also allow the development of
organizations whose origin is in drug dealing, and which may
remain specialized in drug dealing, while taking on organized
crime characteristics, in particular, organizational continuity
and organizational investments in the abilities to use violence
and corruption to resist enforcement efforts while remaining
prominent in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Drug trafficking is almost certainly the largest source of
illegally-earned income in the United States, far outstripping
the market for illegal gambling or prostitution. Estimates of
total revenues from drug sales vary widely and are highly
unreliable. It seems unlikely that total annual revenues are much
less than $25-30 billion. </p>

<p>Virtually all of this represents rewards for lawbreaking; the
payments forlicit goods and services (rental or purchase of
vehicles and buildings; lawyers' fees) are negligible. On the
other hand, relatively little represents revenue to large
criminal organizations, because so much of the final retail price
of illegal drugs consists of the markups of retail dealers and
low-level wholesalers. For heroin and cocaine less than one-tenth
of the final retail price is collected by the dealer who sells
kilogram units. Marijuana, by contrast, with much less vigorous
enforcement at lower levels, undergoes only about a four-to-one
price markup between first domestic distribution and final retail
sale. </p>

<p>Therefore, while all three markets have total values on the
order of $10 billion per year, more than $2 billion of the
marijuana market represents the revenues of high-level
organizations, while the heroin and cocaine markets at that level
represent about $1 billion each. On the other hand, the tighter
distribution channels for heroin and cocaine make it possible for
large and highly disciplined organizations to exist at the
wholesale-retail level, so that organizations with many of the
characteristics of organized crime may exist at lower levels of
those trades (e.g., the Barnes organization in the Harlem heroin
market). </p>

<p>Making Strategy </p>

<p>Drug enforcement actions change the drug markets in ways that
may: (1) help or hurt the efforts of existing organized crime
enterprises, whether traditional or emerging, to participate in
and profit from them; (2) encourage or retard the development of
organized crime characteristics in existing or new enterprises
within the drug markets; (3) be more or less helpful in securing
convictions against members of already-identified organized crime
groups and the identification of new groups meeting those
criteria. </p>

<p>The more effectively drug enforcement is directed toward
organized crime control, the less hospitable organized crime
groups will find the drug markets. On the other hand, an increase
in the overall level of drug enforcement not aimed specifically
at organized crime groups may tend to frustrate organized crime
control by helping existing organized crime groups profit from
the drug trade and by encouraging existing drug enterprises to
take on more organized crime characteristics. </p>

<p>The ability of organized crime groups to profit from the drug
trade - and the tendency of the drug trade to spawn new organized
crime groups - depends both on the amount of money to be made in
that trade and on whether the environment rewards or punishes
tight control and a reputation for violence. Under some
conditions, tightened enforcement can both boost the total money
available to be made and confer competitive advantage on more
violent groups at the expense of less violent ones. </p>

<p>Tighter enforcement can increase the money to be made in any
black market, if it succeeds in raising the price of the
commodity involved and if consumption decreases less, in
percentage terms, than prices rise. (A 50 percent price increase
that causes only a 20 percent decrease in volume will create a
new market with total revenues 1.5 x 0.8 = 1.2 times as large as
the revenues in the old market, and thus increase the money to be
made by 0.2 or 20 percent.) Thus the sensitivity of consumer
demand to retail price - what economists call the
price-elasticity of demand - becomes an essential number to know.
</p>

<p>If the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
greater than one - if a given percentage increase in price will
cause a larger percentage decrease in volume - then price
increases will decrease total revenues. (Such goods are said to
be &quot;relatively elastically demanded.&quot;) On the other
hand, if the price-elasticity of demand is (in absolute value)
less than one - if a given percentage change in price will cause
a smaller percentage change in volume, as in the example above -
then price increases will increase total revenues. (Such goods
are said to be &quot;relatively inelastically demanded.&quot;) </p>

<p>In markets where demand is relatively elastic - where
consumers will respond to price increases by cutting back
consumption sharply - increased enforcement will reduce the money
at stake and thus tend to make the markets less lucrative for
organized crime. Where demand is inelastic, increasing
enforcement will increase the money at stake and thus make the
markets more able to support organized crime. Much of the
empirical work recommended below centers on measuring the
price-elasticity of demand for various drugs. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that the demand for marijuana and
cocaine is relatively inelastic. (The argument with respect to
marijuana is on much firmer ground than the argument with respect
to cocaine.) In any case, tightened general drug enforcement - as
opposed to drug enforcement targeted at organized crime - will
tend to give organized crime groups and organized crime-like
groups relative competitive advantage, because their capacity for
violence and corruption helps protect then against ordinary
enforcement actions. This is the central tension in organized
crime/drug enforcement policy: good drug enforcement may be bad
organized crime control. </p>

<p>Observations to be Made </p>

<p>The observations to be made fall into three broad classes:
retail purchasing and consumption, lower-level dealing, and
enforcement activity. (Of course, observations on high-level
dealing are also of great importance, but they are almost
impossible to distinguish from enforcement intelligence. Data
collection here means talking to agents, enforcement-agency
analysts, and prosecutors, and the information to be collected is
rarely in quantitative form.) </p>

<p>Three Objectives of Data Collection and Analysis </p>

<p>Data collection and analysis about drug markets can serve
three distinct functions: </p>

<p>- Descriptive: measuring the current dimensions of the problem
and identifying trends. Sample questions: How much cocaine was
sold to end users last year? What prices do they pay? How were
those revenues distributed among individuals and groups in the
illicit cocaine industry? What were the relationships between
identified organized crime groups and cocaine trafficking? How
have the volumes and prices in the cocaine market changed over
time? What organized crime groups are active in the cocaine
market? What role does it play in their other activities? What
roles do they play - productive or parasitic - in the market? </p>

<p>- Theoretical: generating and testing hypotheses about
relationships among variables, and in particular about the likely
effects of changes in enforcement. Sample questions: Are there
&quot;barriers to entry&quot; at some levels of the cocaine trade
that allow traffickers to collect &quot;pure&quot; profits
(&quot;economic rents&quot;)? How would the average size and
longevity of cocaine-trafficking organizations change if
enforcement were substantially tightened? </p>

<p>- Evaluative: measuring the actual effects of enforcement
initiatives. Sample question: How did the South Florida Task
Force change prices and volumes in the cocaine market? </p>

<p>Three Sources of Data </p>

<p>Illicit activities are by their nature hard to observe and
measure, because participants attempt to conceal them from
authorities. Excise tax data, which provide the most convenient
measures of alcohol and tobacco consumption, are unavailable for
illicit drug markets. The same is true of the reports routinely
prepared by licit enterprises reports to state and federal tax
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
collectors, to trade associations and government statistical
agencies, and to stockholders - from which estimates of licit
markets are derived. </p>

<p>The remaining potential sources of information about illicit
drug markets are: </p>

<p>(1) Surveys of drug users and potential drug users; </p>

<p>(2) Observations of the consequences of drug - abuse health
effects, intoxicated behavior, and demand for treatment - and the
opinions of professionals who deal with those consequences; and </p>

<p>(3) Enforcement data and the opinions of agents and
prosecutors. </p>

<p>Note that while surveys and observations of consequences tell
us almost exclusively about the behavior of drug consumers and
drug dealers, enforcement data and the opinions of enforcement
professionals can also tell us about the other half of the
equation: the governmental response. </p>

<p>Several current programs now attempt to tap these three
sources of information. None is without major flaws from the
perspective of organized crime policy. A major problem common to
many is that they are more concerned with numbers of users and
frequency of use consumed than with quantities consumed and flows
of revenues. </p>

<p>Survey Research </p>

<p>Survey research is potentially the most powerful tool
available for studying the markets for illicit drugs. Unlike data
from enforcement activity or abuse consequences, survey research
can attempt to measure prices and quantities directly rather than
through complicated chains of inference. Performing surveys about
consumption activities - market research supports a rather
prosperous industry, including both for-profit enterprises and
prestigious universities and nonprofit research centers. These
institutions have developed a repertoire of established
techniques. The fact that consumer-goods firms continue to use it
heavily testifies to the ability of market research to measure
and predict consumer behavior. </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse funds two series of
survey research projects on illicit drug consumption. The Social
Research Group of George Washington University does a survey
every two years of more than 5,000 persons 12 years or older
living in households [Miller et al. 1983]. This series is
referred to among students of drug abuse as &quot;the household
survey.&quot; </p>

<p>Every year, the Institute of Social Research of the University
of Michigan questions about 17,000 seniors in high school. The
Michigan reports are referred to as &quot;the high-school senior
survey.&quot; These two surveys are believed to cost NIDA
something less than one-half a million dollars for each two-year
cycle. </p>

<p>The concept of survey research is simple. Draw a sample so
designed that every member of the population under study has an
equal probability of being chosen. (This is what statisticians
mean by the term &quot;random sample.&quot; A variant on simple
randomization is to divide the population under study into
subgroups, called &quot;strata,&quot; and to draw the sample so
that each stratum is represented in proportion to its
representation in the population, and each member of a given
stratum has the same chance of being drawn as any other member.
This procedure, called &quot;stratified random sampling,&quot; is
the most commonly used.) Having drawn the sample, ask questions
and record the answers. Then use the percentage answers from the
sample as estimates of the behavior of the population from which
the sample was drawn: that is, make population projections based
on sample results. </p>

<p>Surveys can be inaccurate for three reasons: random error,
sample bias, and response bias. </p>

<p>Random error (or &quot;sampling error&quot;) occurs because
the law of averages only works on average. If 30 percent of the
population uses Crest Toothpaste, then in a sample of 100 persons
drawn at random about 30 will say they use Crest. But the
operative word is &quot;about:&quot; one time it will be 28,
another 33. The larger the sample, the smaller the random
sampling error, in accord with well-known statistical formulas.
This does not depend on the size of the population to be
measured: a sample of 1,000 is subject to the same sampling error
in estimating a population of 100,000 as in estimating a
population of 10 million. The rule of thumb is that the sampling
error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample
size: a sample four times as big gives estimates one half as
uncertain. For many purposes - predicting the outcome of a
Presidential election, for example - a sample size of a few
hundred is ample. </p>

<p>The smaller the percentage of a population that has some
trait, the larger the sample needed to measure that trait
accurately, because a sampling error of 2 percent looms larger if
the underlying figure is 5 percent than if it is 50 percent.
Thus, attempts to measure rare phenomena - heroin use, for
example - take bigger samples than attempts to measure common
phenomena such as alcohol use. The other factor that drives up
needed sample sizes is the desire to study how subgroups of a
population differ. In a study of the effect of income on cocaine
use, the relevant sample size is the number of respondents within
each income class. To study whether recent increases in marijuana
enforcement by the Boston DEA office succeeded in reducing
marijuana consumption, one would need a sample including at least
a few hundred marijuana consumers from New England, and a similar
sample from another area to serve as a control. </p>

<p>Other than the expensive expedient of using very large sample
sizes - such as the 50,000 households interviewed each month by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics - the only way to reduce
sampling-error problems in estimating rare traits is to deviate
from stratified random sampling. Areas under special study or
subpopulations among which the trait in question is less rare can
be deliberately overrepresented. For example, if cocaine use is
concentrated among upper-income urban males in the 20-45 age
bracket, a study of cocaine use might deliberately seek out a
sample including more such people; this is called oversampling.
The results of a survey using oversampling need to be adjusted to
project them back on the population. Those adjustments introduce
great complexity into the statistical analysis of survey data.
Subtle errors can easily creep in. In consequence, survey
researchers try to avoid using oversamples. </p>

<p>Random error, just because it is random, does not tend to bias
results. The luck of the draw produces overestimates and
underestimates impartially. It does, however, introduce
uncertainty. This is more of a problem when trying to measure
trends (where small changes from one survey to the next matter
greatly) than in measuring absolute levels. By contrast, both
sample bias and response bias can create systematic divergences
between survey results and actual phenomena. </p>

<p>Sample bias comes from a failure to draw a representative
sample. If the sampling technique makes persons with a given
trait under study more or less likely than average to be
selected, the sample results will consistently overestimate or
underestimate the trait in question. For example, the household
survey omits persons with no fixed address and those living in
dormitories, barracks, and prisons. If very heavy drug users are
more likely than the general population to be drifting, away at
school, in the service, or in prison, then the household survey
will underestimate the number of very heavy drug users.
Similarly, the high-school senior survey may underrepresent drug
abuse among persons in that age range for two reasons. By
choosing to study high-school seniors, it omits dropouts, who may
be more likely than average to be heavy drug users. In addition,
the actual sampling technique may tend to underrepresent frequent
absentees, and frequent absenteeism seems to be associated with
heavy drug use. </p>

<p>If the only statistics of interest are population proportions
(e.g., the proportion of the voters who think the President is
doing a good job), sample bias is a controllable problem. When
frequency or quantity is at issue (e.g., how frequently the
average high-school senior smokes marijuana, how much cocaine was
consumed last year, the total amount paid for heroin) sample bias
can be a major worry. A small proportion of any population can
easily account for a very large fraction of any activity, from
baseball games attended to books purchased. In the case of
alcohol, for example, 5 percent of the population accounts for 50
percent of the consumption. By one estimate, 10 percent of the
marijuana-using population smokes two-thirds of the marijuana.
Cocaine consumption may be even more skewed, with the additional
problem that the total number of cocaine users is itself much
smaller than the totals for marijuana and alcohol; two-thirds or
more of the cocaine consumption may be accounted for by one-half
a million users. </p>

<p>Sampling procedures to guard against underrepresenting such
very small populations are hard to devise, particularly when the
behavior under study tends to make them furtive or to reduce
their participation in various normal activities. Oversampling
can help; so can what are called &quot;snowball&quot; techniques,
where respondents who fit some profile are asked for the names of
other respondents. The illicit nature of drug abuse can make
&quot;snowball&quot; sampling very difficult, however. </p>

<p>Response bias comes from the systematic failure of respondents
to answer accurately. Any survey will gather some inaccurate
responses, due to misunderstanding the questions, lapses of
memory, or deliberate deception by respondents resulting from
fear of breach of confidentiality, embarrassment, or a simple
desire to tell the interviewer what the respondent thinks he or
she wants to be told. As long as those errors cancel out, they
pose no problem. The problem comes if the inaccuracies are tilted
to one side or the other. A survey that asks questions about
activities that are both illegal and socially disapproved runs a
greater-than-normal risk of encountering response bias. </p>

<p>A clue to how serious response bias can be, even with legal
behavior, comes from surveys where people are asked how much
alcohol they drink. Only two-thirds of the alcohol on which
excise tax is paid (which may be an undercount of alcohol sold if
distillers cheat the Treasury) is accounted for by survey
responses; the survey data thus underestimate consumption by at
least 50 percent. It has been suggested that psychological
&quot;denial&quot; by a small population of extremely heavy
drinkers may account for most of the difference. Here again, as
with sample bias, problems with a very small portion of the
sample can cause the results to be seriously wrong. On the other
hand, a compilation of studies in which survey responses to
questions about illegal drug use were compared with urine-test
results showed no tendency to underreport. </p>

<p>A special kind of response-bias problem comes when survey data
are used to estimate trends. If the level or social disapproval
as perceived by recipients changes, then response bias may change
too. For example, increasingly negative attitudes about marijuana
use might lead adolescent respondents to the high-school seniors
survey to be less likely to tell adult interviewers that they
smoked marijuana every day, even if their actual behavior did not
change. The result would be an apparent, but spurious, decline in
heavy marijuana use among adolescents. (This is not to say that
changing attitudes might not also change behavior, only that the
survey evidence is subject to error from this source). </p>

<p>There are no easy answers to the problem of response bias.
Sometimes, as in the studies cited by K. H. Marquis, it is
possible to collect independent data as a check on a sample of
responses, and then adjust the sample results for the measured
bias. Another strategy is to vary the circumstances of response,
for example, by using &quot;secret ballot&quot; answer sheets
instead of face-to-face questioning or by changing the
characteristics of the interviewers. Just as pollsters long ago
discovered that black respondents answered many questions
differently when the interviewers were black, it may be the case
that some adolescents would respond differently to questions
about drug use put by another adolescent - particularly one
dressed and groomed in ways consistent with drug use - than to
the same questions put by an adult. </p>

<p>Changes and Supplements to Current Surveys </p>

<p>Both the household survey and the high-school seniors survey,
conducted by experienced researchers at institutions with
reputations for producing high-quality survey research, are
well-designed for their intended purposes: primarily the
measurement of the number of drug users, secondarily the
measurement of frequency of drug use. But from the perspective of
making drug enforcement policy, and particularly policy to
control organized crime, they do not gather the right data, or
gather it from the right people, or gather it frequently enough.
The most important things surveys can tell us are the quantity of
each drug purchased and consumed; the prices at which those
purchases are made; the identities and relationships of buyers
and sellers; the effects of enforcement on market conditions; and
the effects of market conditions on consumption. In order to
learn these things, surveys would have to: </p>

<p>1. Find More of the Heavy Drug-Users. So much of total drug
consumption is concentrated among a relatively few very heavy
users that no practical increase in sample size for a stratified
random sample among the general population will yield an adequate
sample. For example, the 5,000-person household survey could
expect to get by chance about a dozen of the one half-million
heaviest cocaine users. There are two ways to get a meaningful
sample of heavy users: either use oversampling in drawing
respondents for the household and high-school senior surveys, or
run separate studies of heavy use. The &quot;Young Men and
Drugs&quot; studies show both the feasibility of finding samples
rich in serious drug abusers and the value of the results that
finding such samples can yield. </p>

<p>2. Ask about Prices and Quantities purchased. We would like to
know when the user's last purchase of a given drug took place;
what quantity was involved, plus whatever the purchaser knows or
was told about purity/potency/ quality; and how much money
changed hands; this information is essential to making any
serious estimate of the dollar volume of the market. </p>

<p>3. Ask about the Conditions of the Transaction. Where did the
purchase take place? (The purchaser's residence, the seller's, a
school building, an office building, an apartment corridor, a
park, a street corner?) Were there other people present? Had the
transaction been prenegotiated? Was the price
take-it-or-leave-it, or was there negotiation? Was the
purchaser's previous transaction with the same seller or a
different seller? Is the seller a relative, a close friend, and
acquaintance, or a stranger? These questions can help answer
questions about the possible effectiveness of retail-level
enforcement as a way to cut down on the volume of drugs consumed.
</p>

<p>4. Ask about Price Increases, Shortages, Sharing, and Consumer
Inventories. Was the price of the most recent transaction higher
or lower than the respondent's previous transaction? Than the
respondent expected? If the price of the drug were to increase by
25 percent, what would the respondent do? (Use about the same
amount, use less, quit altogether, switch to another drug?) Has
the respondent ever been unable to find a supply of the drug in
question at any price? Does the respondent now have a supply of
the drug? If so, how long would it last at his normal consumption
rate? How frequently has the respondent used drugs purchased by
another? Given drugs to another? These questions will help
determine the effect of price increases and temporary shortages
on consumption behavior. Unfortunately, experience from market
research on legitimate products suggests that the answers to the
what-if questions are likely to be unreliable. </p>

<p>5. Give Information about Local Markets. Federal and local
enforcement efforts vary widely across the country in their
intensity and success, but there are almost no studies of what
the effects are on retail purchases and consumption. Nationwide
samples need to be supplemented with local ones. </p>

<p>6. Provide a Steady Stream of Data in Addition to Annual or
Once-Every-Two-Years Snapshots. This is particularly valuable in
combination with local data as a way of measuring the difference
enforcement makes (or fails to make). Is the availability of
drugs fairly constant, or does it vary? How do consumers respond?
Estimating the price-elasticity of demand requires frequent
measurements of both price and quantity, both to generate an
adequate number of data points and to avoid confounding price
effects with long-term trends or cohort effects on the demand
side. </p>

<p>One alternative to random sampling often used in market
research is a panel survey, where questions are asked repeatedly
of the same group of respondents. Panel data would be enormously
useful in understanding the effects of market conditions on drug
use, and the individual patterns of drug consumption. For
example, when drug supplies are short, how are consumption
decreases distributed among new users and existing users, poor
users and affluent users, heavy users and light users? What drugs
are used as substitutes when marijuana is scarce or expensive?
How many users, who cease use when supplies are tight, never
start up again, or start up at lower levels of use? An obvious
problem is assuring respondent confidentiality, and convincing
respondents that it is assured. Perhaps more worrisome, being
members of such a panel might make respondents more
drug-conscious, which raises serious ethical questions, as well
as threatening the validity of such studies. </p>

<p>Obstacles </p>

<p>Naturally, proposing such studies for someone else to fund and
carry out is much easier than doing the work. Aside from the
problems of expense and the mass of legal, ethical, and
operational issues raised by asking detailed questions about
illegal transactions, such studies would face several obstacles: </p>

<p>First, they would have to be cleared by the Office of
Management and Budget, which views any expansion of survey
research by the government with a jaundiced eye. The complexity
of the questions to be asked strongly argues for the value of
paying respondents a small fee to encourage them to complete the
interview, but this makes OMB reviewers even more nervous. (The
1981 household survey didn't get into the field until 1982
because of a dispute with OMB about forms and payments to
respondents.) </p>

<p>Second, modifying the existing surveys in terms of content or
sample selection will interfere with the ability of researchers
to compare results from one survey to the next to determine
trends. The preference of survey researchers for asking the same
questions in the same words to the same samples is not mindless
conservatism, but a well-founded belief in the virtues of
repeating measurements exactly, rather than changing survey
series represents a big investment of money and talent. </p>

<p>Finally, it is worth noting that neither the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, which funds the current surveys, nor the
researches who conduct them, share the policy and research
perspective urged here. NIDA is far more interested in the
patterns of drug abuse than in the size and functioning of the
drug markets. Nor is there any demand for this sort of research
from the enforcement and prosecution agencies. </p>

<p>Surveys of Dealers </p>

<p>The discussion above concerns only surveys of drug users. It
is also possible to survey drug dealers, asking both about their
own dealings - transactions, strategies for dealing with
customers, suppliers, and enforcement agencies, incomes,
expenses, encounters, if any, with organized crime, opinions of
enforcement risk, pricing policy, recruitment into the trade,
career patterns and goals - and about their knowledge of how the
drug markets work. There is probably no better way to start on
serious estimates of, for example, bow many marijuana or cocaine
to deliver drugs to the market - is more plausible the fewer the
participants, and the more stable the organizational structure,
of any given market. </p>

<p>Finding and interviewing a sample of dealers poses both
problems and risks for the researcher. However, we do have access
to a sample of drug dealers with nothing better to do than answer
questions: they are in federal and state prisons. Of course, they
may be unrepresentative of the overall dealer population,
particularly in terms of their success in avoiding enforcement,
and may also be unwilling to be interviewed, or to speak
candidly. </p>

<p>Still, if systematic interviews could be conducted with a
sample of convicted drug dealers, the results could not fail to
be informative. The Rand Corporation is now conducting a pilot
study along those lines funded by the National Institute of
Justice. </p>

<p>Consequence Data </p>

<p>One alternative to asking people about their consumption of
illicit substances is to observe the consequences of drug abuse.
These consequences include coming into contact with both the
police (arrests, automobile accidents) and the health care
system: hospital emergency rooms, medical examiners' offices, and
drug treatment facilities. There is now no systematic attempt to
record drug intoxication at arrest or at accident scenes of drug
users, but the National Institute of Drug Abuse maintains three
collection activities to gather medical data: the Drug Abuse
Warning Network (DAWN), the Client-Oriented Data Acquisition
Process (CODAP) and the Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG).
</p>

<p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse collects and publishes
[National Institute on Drug Abuse Statistical Series I)
information from about one-sixth of the nation's emergency rooms,
with a heavy concentration on 26 metropolitan areas (SMSA's), and
from about two-thirds of the medical examiners in those 26 SMSA's
only. The emergency rooms report on patients who come in as a
result of acute ill experiences with the non-medical use of
drugs; the medical examiners report on persons who, in their
judgment, died as the direct result of drug use. In 1981, the
most recent year for which the data have been published, the DAWN
system recorded 121,268 emergency room visits and 2,825 deaths,
as a result of drugs. (The deaths exclude New York City, which
did not report to DAWN in 1981; in previous years, New York had
accounted for about one-quarter of DAWN medical examiner
reports.) </p>

<p>DAWN records all drugs used incidents of multiple drug abuse:
thus 121,268 emergency room &quot;episodes&quot; yielded 199,400
&quot;mentions,&quot; and 2,825 deaths involved 5,640 mentions.
Heroin is the third most frequently-mentioned drug in emergency
rooms, after alcohol-in-combination (alcohol alone is now counted
in DAWN) and diazepam (Valium). Cocaine is sixth, marijuana
seventh. Others in the top ten are aspirin, methaqualone,
acetaminophen (Tylenol), flurezapam (another tranquilizer) and
PCP. Heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, the three largest drug
markets in dollar terms, account for fewer than 20,000 total
mentions among them. This is such a tiny proportion of the users
of these drugs (about 1 in 50 heroin users, about 1 in 1,000
cocaine users, about 1 in 5,000 marijuana users) as to make any
inferences from the DAWN sample to the general population
extremely questionable. In any case, other than personal
demographic data, no questions are asked of DAWN subjects other
than &quot;what did you take?&quot; For some drugs, even the
answer to this question may be open to doubt, since illicit drug
sellers frequently misrepresent their wares, and DAWN sites are
not equipped to assay blood or urine to determine the chemical
composition of the &quot;speed&quot; or &quot;ludes&quot; that
subjects report they have taken. </p>

<p>Attempts to base estimates of patterns and trends in drug
availability on DAWN data, but they have not been convincing.
DAWN is valuable as an early warning network about both street
drugs and pharmaceuticals causing injury and death; but it does
not, and almost certainly cannot, contribute much to our
understanding of the kind of drug trafficking that contributes to
organized crime. </p>

<p>The Client Oriented Data Acquisition Process (CODAP) </p>

<p>Through 1981 NIDA gathered data from all federally-funded drug
treatment clinics and programs and published them as NIDA
Statistical Series E. Incentive to participate was provided by
making participation a condition of funding under the NIDA
categorical grant program that paid for drug treatment. The
abolition of that categorical grant program and the inclusion of
drug treatment in the Community Development Block Grant program
of direct fiscal assistance to the states both reduced the total
number of drug treatment facilities and eliminated any direct
relationship between the clinics and NIDA. As a result, NIDA can
mo longer compel participation in CODAP. Approximately 15 states
have voluntarily continued to submit CODAP data, and NIDA
collects the information and prepares am unofficial series of
annual reports. In 1981 there were 249,206 admissions to CODAP
facilities, more than three-fourths for outpatient treatment.
(Persons admitted more than once during the year were
double-counted, so the number of individuals admitted was
somewhat smaller). At any one time there were an average of
126,000 persons under treatment, almost 85 percent as
outpatients. </p>

<p>While CODAP collected demographic data and information about
the drugs for which its clients sought or were assigned to
treatment, it did not collect data about individual purchase and
consumption patterns. Variations in CODAP counts over time might
indicate either increases in abuser populations brought about by
increased availability, growing numbers of addicts without
connections brought about by decreased availability, or merely
increased availability of treatment. CODAP data were of great
interest to treatment professionals and produced interesting
time-series data on such indicators as age at first use (which
allowed some inferences about &quot;cohort effects&quot;).
However, CODAP had even less direct relevance to enforcement
planning than did DAWN. While local studies of enforcement
effectiveness may wish to gather data on treatment demand, this
can probably be done as effectively on an ad hoc basis as through
a process like CODAP. Reviving that process would not seem to be
a high priority from the viewpoint of organized-crime
policymaking. </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) </p>

<p>The Community Epidemiology Work Group, also supported by NIDA,
collects reports from drug abuse prevention and treatment experts
and officials around the country about patterns and trends as
they perceive them in their own areas, and summarizes and
publishes those reports in volumes of &quot;Proceedings&quot;.
The local reports are not in standard format, and CEWG does not
generate statistical series. Prices are occasionally mentioned;
quantities rarely, if ever. It is conceivable that CEWG
participants night be encouraged and funded to develop informal
&quot;panel studies&quot; among drug users in their own areas.
But this would represent a substantial move away from CEWG's
current informality. </p>

<p>Changes and Other Studies </p>

<p>As suggested above, drug abuse consequence data have little
promise of contributing much to making or evaluating strategy
against organized crime. The one source not now tapped is arrest
data. Arrests of users - particularly heroin users - for property
crimes and prostitution may be quite sensitive indicators of
short-run changes in availability. To develop such data, it would
be necessary to test arrestees' urine for the presence of opiate
metabolites and quinine. The National Institute of Justice is
funding a few pilot programs along these lines. Assuming they
turn out to be operationally feasible, they probably represent a
wise investment of funds. </p>

<p>Enforcement Data </p>

<p>From the agencies that arrest, prosecute, try, and imprison
drug traffickers and seize their drugs and other assets, we can
gather valuable data both about the enforcement activity and
about the underlying illegitimate market. Some of this
information exists, or can readily be obtained, in statistical
form; the rest is buried in case reports, informant interviews,
and intelligence analyses. The one governmentally-published
series estimating the revenues in the drug markets, the annual
Narcotics Intelligence Estimate, is prepared primarily by
enforcement agencies (particularly DEA) and apparently in large
part from enforcement sources. </p>

<p>Information About Enforcement Activity </p>

<p>Three things about enforcement activity are of interest: </p>

<p>(1) Inputs. What resources - measured in dollars, agent-hours,
prosecutor-hours, cell-years, ship-days, wiretap orders under
Title III - are spent on drug enforcement, and how are those
resources divided among agencies, geographically, by target drug,
by enforcement technique, and by the trafficking activity under
investigation (high-seas smuggling, port smuggling, first
domestic distribution, wholesaling and middleman activity, retail
dealing, money laundering)? </p>

<p>Even at the Federal level alone, something as relatively
simple as a comprehensive dollar budget broken down by agency and
by drug is not available. An attempt has been made to estimate
the share of marijuana in total Federal enforcement; it
illustrates both what is and what is not available. Assembling
such data is best done within the government, by an agency with
the authority to demand the relevant documents, than by
outsiders; the Drug policy Board, the Office of Management and
Budget, the White House Drug Abuse policy Office, any one of the
cognizant Congressional subcommittees, the General Accounting
Office, or the President's Commission on Organized Crime could,
by collating budget submissions from the agencies involved,
assemble crude but adequate estimates of dollars spent by agency
and drug rather easily. </p>

<p>Assembling meaningful information about inputs in non-monetary
forms (e.g., work-hours) would be a tedious process, requiring
both access to internal agency reporting systems and an
understanding of how those systems represent or misrepresent
reality. However, assuming that something resembling the DEA's
annual statistical report is available from the Coast Guard,
Customs Service, IRS, and FBI, it might be possible to assemble a
fair picture of Federal enforcement activity. Federal prosecution
agencies do not now have the ability to generate statistical
profiles of their work that would be useful here. The
case-management software system (PROMIS) being installed in the
U.S. Attorneys' offices may be able to produce estimates of
prosecutive work-hours by case type, although the system may not
code enough of the case data (e.g., G-DEP rank of case and
defendants) to allow useful analysis. </p>

<p>The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts can produce
cases-pending counts by offense, although this overestimates drug
cases as a proportion of total cases to the extent that drug
defendants are more likely than others to default on bail and
thus remain as active cases for long periods of time; no
estimates are made of the use of judge-days or grand jury days
for various kinds of cases. Moreover, since the statute names and
numbers attached to a given drug charge (manufacture,
distribution, conspiracy, continuing criminal enterprise, etc.)
do not vary with drug involved, it is almost impossible to
separate the conviction data by drug. It is possible to make very
crude estimates of Federal prison-cell utilization by convicted
drug dealers from the court data. The attempt to work directly
from DEA data is frustrated by the fact that the DEA statistical
report lists total convictions, rather than convictions in
Federal courts. The lack of a unified set of file numbers for the
federal criminal-justice agencies, or a set of links from one
file system to the next (what is called an &quot;Offender-Based
Tracking system,&quot; or OBTS) makes it nearly impossible to
trace a sample of DEA defendants through prosecution and
incarceration. </p>

<p>The primary problem with assembling such data is not
technical, but organizational: its collection and dissemination
are not in the perceived interests of the agencies involved or
the key individuals within them. While that remains, little
progress is to be expected. Below the Federal level, the
situation is much worse; there are simply no published figures on
drug enforcement spending or activities by state and local police
agencies, most of which do not have separate drug enforcement
units. </p>

<p>The current paucity of data on enforcement activities would
frustrate any attempt to study the effects of changes in
enforcement resources on the drug markets, even if adequate price
and quantity data were in hand. This problem is not easy to fix;
unless the agencies involved have their own reasons for
collecting the data, it will be difficult either for
&quot;outsiders&quot; - even from within the government - to do
the job or to persuade the agencies to do it instead. The
situation is similar for state and local enforcement; in the
absence of any convenient ways of getting nationwide data, a few
studies of individual cities and states might be useful. </p>

<p>(2) Outputs. How do those inputs translate into enforcement
actions felt by traffickers: arrests, convictions, sentences,
time actually served in prison, drug seizures, asset seizures?
How are those outputs distributed geographically, by drug, by
level of the traffic? </p>

<p>These figures are less nebulous than resource and workload
data; a man-hour is &quot;the stuff that dreams are made
on,&quot; but an arrest actually happens. Nonetheless, although
DEA reports its arrests broken down by almost every possible
variable, there is no government-wide collation of all arrest
reports. Convictions and prison time, as noted above, are simply
not available in useful formats. </p>

<p>Even drug seizure data are complicated by the multiplicity of
agencies involved; simply adding together agency totals runs the
risk of double-counting. The first annual report of the Organized
Crime Drug Trafficking Task Force program gives government-wide
numbers that may be reliable. </p>

<p>Data on asset seizures are complicated both by interagency
(and Federal/ State/local) cooperation and by the complexity of
seizure cases: appraised value is one thing, realized value less
lienholders' equity something very different. The lags in
forfeiture actions against seized items, plus the growth in the
overall level of seizures, make it difficult to compute
seizure-to-forfeiture ratios, because 1984 forfeitures do not
correspond to 1984 seizures. Some central responsibility for this
area was assigned to the U.S. Marshal Service and the Asset
Forfeiture Office of the Criminal Division of the Justice
Department; those agencies may now be in a position to provide
unified statistics. </p>

<p>Arrests, convictions, seizures, and prison time are basic
measures of risk imposed on the illicit drug industry, and it is
very hard to plan or evaluate policy in their absence. Unlike
most of the input numbers, good output measures can be assembled
with only minimal cooperation from the agencies themselves, if
someone with authority insists on it. </p>

<p>Below the Federal level the situation is more dismal. Other
than the uninformative counts of total drug arrests in the
Uniform Crime Reports, no national data are available. It has
been almost ten years since the last national study of state
prisoners by offense category, and even that study combined all
drug offenses into one category. Here again, the best that can be
hoped for is a few well-done local studies. </p>

<p>(3) Effects. Enforcement actions impose costs and risks on
illicit entrepreneurs and thus tend to increase prices and
perhaps to make supplies less reliable. To some extent the
cost-imposition value of a given enforcement action - the
imprisonment of a major marijuana importer for an effective term
of six years, the seizure of one kilogram of 90 percent pure
heroin from a New York City wholesaler - can be calculated, and
those costs can be added together to estimate the effects of
enforcement on the market. Such calculations could contribute
substantially to policy analysis and evaluation. They could form
the basis for comparisons of alternative enforcement techniques
in terms of the costs imposed on a given drug market per
government dollar spent. However, to make then accurately one
needs the right kind of tabulation of enforcement outputs. </p>

<p>The value of any illicit drug grows enormously as it moves
down the distribution chain toward the final consumer. A kilogram
of heroin that sells for $200,000 is the raw material for street
bags of heroin worth more than $2 million. Adding together
physical volumes seized at different stages of the traffic is
adding apples and oranges. Each seizure should be evaluated at
the point where it is seized, and then the values added together.
The &quot;street value&quot; calculations, so beloved by
reporters, resemble calculations of the value of stolen cattle
based on the price of a steak dinner in a restaurant. Given
estimates of the &quot;price chains&quot; (of which more below),
simple rules of thumb, based on quantity and location, will give
reasonable estimates of the coast imposed on the illicit market
by drug seizures. Imprisonment data also need to be
quality-weighted. The higher in the trade a trafficker is, the
more dollars he would spend to avoid a year in prison, both
because he has more dollars and because any given period in
prison costs him more in lost earnings. That willingness-to-pay
per prison-year-willingness-to-pay of traffickers at different
levels. But unless the data on imprisonment are collected by drug
and G-DEP violator class, there are no figures to use in
calculation. </p>

<p>Information about Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime </p>

<p>Enforcement activity yields two kinds of information about
drug trafficking: (1) that which can be inferred from the
enforcement statistics, and (2) that known to (and sometimes
published by) agents, prosecutors, and enforcement-agency
intelligence analysts. </p>

<p>(1) Inferences from Enforcement Statistics. Lost in the
organizational history of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is the
unsung hero who first proposed the rule of thumb that enforcement
agencies capture about 10 percent of the drug supply on its way
to market. That rule of thumb allows (once the problems with the
seizure data are straightened away) a simple calculation of the
physical size of the drug markets: take seizures and add a zero.
More of the official drug market estimation than anyone would
like to admit is still based on some variant of that methodology.
</p>

<p>There are two problems with this calculation. First, there was
never a period when we had a good measure of the total market
traffickers will tend to lower it. In fact, if the change in
enforcement is great enough to cause shifts in basic smuggling
patterns, the result may be a lower overall seizure rate despite
a higher level of enforcement. This seems to have been the case
for the South Florida Task Force, which succeeded both in driving
drug smugglers away from its territory and in causing many of
them to switch from large vessels to smaller, faster vessels;
total seizures actually fell. </p>

<p>The same is true of using other enforcement measures as
estimates of market size. The enforcement success count depends
on the size of the market, the vigor and tactics of enforcement,
and the countermeasures of traffickers. Without an independent
basis for estimating the effect of countermeasures, the success
count tells us little even about trends in the size of the
market. </p>

<p>(2) Facts and Analysis From Agents and Agencies. Drug
enforcement agencies are not in business to collect data or do
analysis; they are in business to put drug dealers in jail and
seize their drugs. Like other agencies, they tend to collect and
publish data that will help them do their job better, will
persuade someone else to help them do their job better, or will
make them look good. </p>

<p>Traditionally, the Drug Enforcement Agency and its
predecessors defined their mission as controlling the supply of
drugs. Thus, for example, the estimates of the price and purity
of heroin at retail were published as part of the
&quot;Performance Measurement System,&quot; implying that drug
availability was an important measure of agency effectiveness.
This mission definition encouraged the development within DEA of
an extensive &quot;strategic intelligence&quot; capability,
devoted to understanding the drug markets. By contrast, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has always defined its mission as
securing the conviction of lawbreakers. It regarded the number of
bank robbers it caught, rather than the number of bank robberies,
as its central performance measure. Since the 1981 reorganization
that placed DEA under the administrative authority of the
Director of the FBI, DEA's mission definition has moved closer to
the FBI's. At least in part, this reflected a belief that
enforcement outputs were more subject to organizational control,
and thus more likely to consistently reflect organizational
success, than drug market outcomes. This new mission definition
may have advantages from the perspective of organized crime
control. The supply-control approach tended to stress quantities
of drugs rather than trafficking organizations as targets.
However, the new mission definition is much less hospitable to
strategic, as opposed to operational, intelligence. </p>

<p>(a) Price Chains. In the past DEA devoted considerable energy
to estimating &quot;price chains&quot; for drugs, based on
undercover buys and data from informants. That information,
insofar as it was accurate, told a great deal about the structure
of the markets, and in particular about where the money was being
made. It was never formally published, but it was estimated on a
quarterly basis and available to the rest of the government. It
appears that such &quot;price chain&quot; estimates are no longer
made, or no longer made available. If true, that should be
rectified. There is no other source for that information, and it
is essential. There is an enormous amount of relevant information
in DEA case files. Undercover transactions, intercepted
communications, and conversations with informants all contain
price data. The problem is maintaining a staff to collate and
analyze what is there. One improvement that could easily be made
in publishing all statistics on drug prices is to adjust past
prices for the effects of inflation, using the Consumer Price
Index or GNP deflator. Otherwise, anyone trying to determine
price trends has to keep looking up the rate of inflation since
1976, or whatever appropriate date. </p>

<p>(b) &quot;Monitor&quot; Programs. DEA has never had a
substantial number of retail-level cases, but the Performance
Measurement System required data about retail price and purities
for heroin across the country. These were accordingly collected
by the simple expedient of sending agents out to make undercover
retail purchases and collecting retail samples from local police
to seek good quality at low prices? More seriously,
&quot;retail&quot; included samples as large as 2 grams and up to
14 percent pure, while the typical actual retail transaction is
for 100 milligrams (one-tenth of a gram) less than 5 percent
pure. </p>

<p>Now that price-purity data are no longer publicly released,
there seems to be somewhat less monitoring activity than in the
past. It may well be true that a program run by local police
units (perhaps with funding from DEA or NIJ) would be more
effective than DEA-run monitoring efforts. (Unofficial
researchers might develop even more accurate results, but the
legal and ethical problems seem insurmountable). But whether run
by DEA or outside, there is no substitute for actual street buys
as an index of market conditions, and not only for heroin. </p>

<p>Enforcement-based Analysis: NNICC </p>

<p>The National Narcotics Intelligence Consumers Committee
(NNICC, pronounced &quot;nick&quot;) is the official custodian of
estimates regarding the drug markets. It was originally
established to help control the embarrassing flow of mutually
contradictory estimates that used to emerge from various Federal
agencies. Although staffed primarily from DEA, it includes a
broad variety of agencies as members, and its reports are
negotiated products. </p>

<p>At one time, the NNICC annual report, called the Narcotics
Intelligence Estimate, provided sources, physical volumes, and
dollar revenues for each of the four major drug categories:
opiates, cannabis, cocaine, and the &quot;dangerous drugs.&quot;
Subsequently, criticism of the dollar-volume estimates, both from
outsiders and from within the NNICC staff, led to a decision to
cease publication of dollar-volume estimates. At the same time
the marijuana estimates for previous years were restated downward
by approximately one-third. As the NNICC methodology review makes
clear, the NIE figures are largely derived from estimates of
farm-level production in foreign source countries, because the
data sources on the consumption side are so inadequate. However,
that same report shows how weakly grounded the production-based
estimates are. The crop figures themselves are hard to
distinguish from guesswork, and the fraction of each country's
crop reaching the U.S. market is fundamentally unknown. </p>

<p>Still more serious is a problem not considered in the
methodology review: that a large fraction of the total crop in
the average year may go unsold. But a peasant marijuana-grower,
for example, deciding how many plants to grow under uncertainty
both about crop yields and about demand from exporters, will, if
he is rational, overplant on average. Marijuana is so lucrative,
compared with other crops, that it makes sense to grow an extra
plant, even if there is only one chance in five of selling it for
export. Of course, if there were a smoothly functioning
competitive market over wide geographic areas, the result would
be lower prices rather than unsold crops, but the market in
marijuana for export may be highly localized, with exporters
buying from nearby farmers even if prices elsewhere are much
lower. </p>

<p>In general, then, it is hard to place much confidence in the
NIE numbers, particularly because they are presented as a just
set of conclusions, without any detailed presentation of the
underlying data or the calculations performed on that data. One
way to improve this situation would be to gather better data,
particularly about consumption, as discussed above. </p>

<p>On the purely analytic side, two things might be done: (1)
NNICC might publish more of its underlying data and some of the
details about the calculations performed on them, or (2) a team
of outside scholars might be allowed full access to NNICC
materials and asked to prepare an independent estimate. </p>

<p>But whether one considers improving the data with which NNICC
has to work or changing the analytic approach, the fundamental
problem remains one of organizational incentives. The current
lack of adequate data or convincing analysis is not a problem
from the perspective of DEA or other enforcement agencies. If the
information were available, there is no reason to expect that it
would be used to reshape what agents and prosecutors do. In fact,
by providing outsiders with a basis on which to criticize, data
and analysis might seem to threaten agency autonomy. Nor have the
White House or Congressional staffs concerned with these problems
displayed any anxiety over the absence of information. The first
step in solving a problem is getting it identified as a problem
by someone with the resources to bring about a solution. In this
area, that step remains to be taken.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Recommendations for the Regulation of
Selected Chemicals and Controlled Substance Analogs </h2>

<p>By Frank Monastero. Submitted: September 1985. Frank Monastero
retired in 1985, having served as the Chief of Operations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>As we can see from media reports, cocaine has fast become the
nation's number one drug abuse problem. The supply of cocaine
coming from South America has reached overwhelming proportions.
In 1985 alone the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimates
seizures will reach 50,000 pounds, and this, of course, does not
account for that part of the supply that ultimately reaches the
more than 20 million regular users. </p>

<p>Another facet of the drug abuse problem, which could grow as
rapidly if not addressed promptly, is that of controlled
substance analogs, known as &quot;designer drugs.&quot; These are
clandestinely produced substances not covered by the Controlled
Substances Act because of their chemical structure. </p>

<p>Most drugs, including those manufactured illicitly, are
produced at least in part from commercially available chemicals.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the feasibility and
desirability of regulating certain of these chemicals. It will
also analyze how to curtail illicit production and examine what
legal mechanism would be effective to control the manufacture of
synthetic analogs (designer drugs), produced for illicit
purposes. </p>

<p>Cocaine abused in the United States has its origin from the
coca bush, a very hardy plant, grown in certain areas of South
and Central America. As in the case with almost all drugs,
whether produced from plants or totally synthetic, one or more
precursors, reagents or solvents is used in the process. These
chemicals are defined as follows: a precursor is a raw material
used in the production of a controlled substance that becomes
part of the finished product; a reagent reacts chemically with
one or more precursors but does not become part of the finished
product; a solvent, which does not react chemically with a
precursor or reagent and does not become part of the finished
product, is used to dissolve solid precursors or reagents, to
dilute reaction mixtures, and to separate and purify other
chemicals. For example, a precursor for cocaine is coca leaves, a
reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent used in the manufacturing
process is acetone. With respect to methamphetamine, a precursor
is phenyl-2-propanone, a reagent is sulfuric acid, and a solvent
is methanol. It is important to understand that, in the case of
these and other controlled substances, there are many other
precursors, reagents and solvents, which can easily be
substituted to produce the same final product. </p>

<p>With some exceptions only the final product drug itself, is a
controlled substance. Many of the chemicals used to produce or
refine illicit drugs are needed in industry to produce a myriad
of items and are produced in tremendous quantities. Controlling
their distribution would, in most cases, be impossible and
probably undesirable because of the cost alone. Acetone, for
instance, which is used as a solvent in processing opium and coca
leaves, is used to make paints, lubricants, pharmaceuticals,
cosmetics and agricultural products. </p>

<p>Although controlling all precursors, reagents and solvents
used to manufacture illicit drugs is neither desirable nor
feasible, the idea of controlling certain chemicals has merit. In
fact, some chemicals are now subject to regulation. Piperidine is
a precursor to the controlled substance phencyclidine, commonly
known as PCP, which can have serious physical and psychological
consequences when abused. Piperidine is subject to reporting
requirements under the Controlled Substances Act, although its
possession and distribution are not subject to penalties, as is
the case with the possession and distribution of PCP. Forms
recording the sale of piperidine and the purchaser's name must be
maintained for two years. Anyone who sells piperidine must report
the sale. This reporting procedure allows DEA to monitor sales of
piperidine and to investigate those sales recognized as
suspicious by either DEA or the seller. As a result of concerted
efforts begun in late 1984, DEA has seized four clandestine PCP
laboratories and has located at least ten operations that
received chemicals from legitimate channels by posing as
legitimate businesses. In one case a manufacturer shipped a
substantial amount of piperidine to a &quot;chemical
company&quot; over an extended period, all in good faith based on
the company's name. A check of the address by DEA showed it to be
an auto repair shop. </p>

<p>Precursors, reagents and solvents are used to manufacture many
drugs, including synthetic analogs, drugs so close in structure
to controlled substances that they create virtually the same
effect for the user. These are not covered under the Controlled
Substances Act because of minor differences in molecular
structure. Synthetic analogs, commonly known as &quot;designer
drugs,&quot; pose particular health threats. </p>

<p>The production of controlled substance analogs,
pharmacologically active, chemically related substances, to avoid
the laws regulating controlled substances, was first observed in
the mid-1960's with the synthesis of amphetamine analogs of
mescaline, such as MDA and others. Some of this group of
hallucinogenic amphetamines sold on the illicit market were
brought under the Drug Abuse Control Amendments, a predecessor to
the Controlled Substances Act. Others in the group were
subsequently controlled under the Controlled Substances Act after
its passage in 1970. Later three PCP analogs were controlled. </p>

<p>The process of designing analogs is, therefore, not new, and
the formulas are not primarily a phenomenon of clandestine
laboratories. Most of these drugs were developed by legitimate
pharmaceutical chemists in search of better medicinal agents
through the testing of numerous analogs of a parent compound. It
is not surprising, therefore, that some of their precursors have
names such as N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidinyl)-aniline (for
fentanyl) or N-[1-(2-phenylisopropyl)]-4-piperidinone-4-one (for
alpha-methylfentanyl). These analogs, in many cases, mimic the
qualitative actions of the original compound but may vary in
potency or duration of action. Thus, there is a need to deal both
with the problem of chemicals used in the production of illicit
drugs and with the problem of controlled substance analogs. </p>

<p>Factors Affecting the Regulation of Chemicals </p>

<p>There are in excess of 200 precursors, reagents and solvents
used in the production of the 37 most commonly abused substances.
Among these are amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, Diazepam,
hash oil, heroin, LSD, MDA, PCP and methaqualone. In considering
what should be regulated two factors are most significant: (1)
How common is the chemical interest? (2) How great is the
workload to track the needed information? Each situation must be
examined individually, if the objective is to reach an ultimate
solution for each drug. </p>

<p>It is quickly apparent that there is no ultimate, universal
solution to absolute chemical control for all drugs. Acetone and
ether, although widely used, are subject to tracing. Piperidine,
less available commercially, is easily synthesized. The first
conclusion might well be that if the source of the chemical is
known and that source will identify and report suspicious sales,
the investigator will be able to pursue the investigation.
Obviously, this will not help when all chemicals can be obtained
from illicit sources. But when the source will provide assistance
or at least when sales information is available for review,
tracing can be attempted. </p>

<p>The problem then becomes one of resources. How much
information can be reviewed and how many people are available to
pursue leads. These are very significant factors to consider. If,
indeed, all chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances were reported it is unlikely the responsible agency
could cull the most suspicious orders, let alone investigate
them. The computer input itself would be substantial.
Furthermore, the drug abuse situation is constantly changing, and
a chemical, not of interest today, might be a prime target as a
new drug emerges. </p>

<p>Case Study: Ether </p>

<p>Because cocaine abuse is a serious problem in the United
States at this time and because an increasing number of cocaine
laboratories are being seized, it is important to examine the
chemical control of cocaine. To refine coca, dried leaves are
moistened with an alkaline solution, such as lime water, sodium
or potassium carbonate. The moistened leaves are soaked in
kerosene, which extracts cocaine and similar compounds. The
kerosene is extracted with aqueous sulfuric acid, and the acid
neutralized with limestone or lime. After the cocaine
precipitates and is removed by filtering, it becomes coca paste.
To become cocaine base, the paste is dissolved in a solution of
sulfuric acid, and a solution of potassium permanganate is added
to aridize impurities. The solution is filtered to remove
impurities and manganese oxides. Anmoniun hydroxide is added to
the filtrate, and the precipitate is collected and dried, forming
the base. The base is dissolved in acetone or ether and filtered
to remove insoluble material. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is
added in acetone along with ether. Cocaine hydrochloride will
crystallize from this solution and is collected by filtration and
dried. The ratio of base to cocaine hydrochloride is one to one. </p>

<p>Because ether and acetone are readily available in the United
States, traffickers recognized the advantage of processing here,
and the number of base to hydrochloride laboratories seized
increased steadily from 3 in 1980 to 21 in 1984; as of mid-1985,
there were already 25. </p>

<p>Six reagents are used to refine cocaine: ammonia, hydrochloric
acid, lime, limestone, potassium carbonate, potassium
permanganate and sulfuric acid. The four solvents used are
acetone, ethanol, ether and kerosene. These could be targets for
monitoring or control. However, after considering the
availability and usage of each chemical, the possible targets can
be narrowed to acetone and ether. As mentioned earlier, acetone
has a number of legitimate uses. An estimated 2.5 billion pounds
is produced each year in the United States, a commercial value of
about $400 million. </p>

<p>There are 12 major U.S. producers and over 40 foreign sources.
Although usually produced from petroleum or synthesized from
benzene, there are other processes to produce it. Nonetheless,
acetone, in fact, was selected as a target, and the targeting did
produce results. Ether, likewise, has broad use, with a U.S.
production estimate of over 60 million pounds, but with only five
U.S. producers and seven major foreign sources. Ether, therefore,
represents, and did turn out to be, an even better target. </p>

<p>Early in 1982 a project was undertaken to determine how much
ether was being shipped to Colombia and to what, if any,
legitimate uses it was put. Colombia was selected because,
although most of the coca is grown in Bolivia and Peru, most of
the cocaine processing laboratories were known to be in Colombia.
The Colombian government determined that thousands of gallons of
ether were being imported annually, but that there was virtually
no legitimate need for it. Most of the ether was imported from
the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States. Through
liaison with those ether manufacturers and distributors who would
cooperate, hundreds of barrels of the chemical were tracked to
clandestine laboratories deep in the Amazon jungles of Colombia.
Many of these labs were destroyed and thousands of pounds of
cocaine were seized. In the celebrated Tranquilandia raid in
March 1984, 10,000 kilograms of cocaine paste and base were
seized and destroyed, along with thousands of barrels of
chemicals. Through court testimony and media attention, cocaine
producers have, no doubt, become aware of the detection
techniques used to locate laboratories, and they are or will take
action to avoid detection. Opportunities for a continuing supply
of ether exist through unscrupulous manufacturers and
distributors and through clandestine production from ethanol.
However, the program has been useful and demonstrates the
effectiveness of the monitoring approach. </p>

<p>Case Study: P2P </p>

<p>In addition to tracking chemicals, such as ether, another
approach is to bring certain chemicals under the Controlled
Substances Act. For experience with this approach, it is
important to examine methamphetamine and one of its precursors,
phenyl-2-propanone (P2P). Domestic methamphetamine production is
significant. In fact, during a 45 month period beginning in
September 1981, more than 50 percent of the 751 clandestine
laboratories seized by DEA were methamphetamine labs. In order to
control clandestine methamphetamine production, P2P was placed in
Schedule II of the Controlled Substance Act on February 11, 1980.
P2P is an immediate precursor (used in the step just prior to
completion) in the most desirable synthesis and was, therefore, a
good choice for targeting. Furthermore, with the exception of its
use as a cleaning solution, most of its uses are in connection
with pharmaceutical manufacturing. Annual production in the U.S.
is estimated to be about 10,000 pounds, with only two principal
domestic producers and nine foreign sources. Full control of P2P
under the Control Substances Act resulted in a significant
increase in the number of clandestine methamphetamine laboratory
operators synthesizing P2P. More than 75 percent of the
laboratories seized after passage were refluxing phenylacetic
acid and acetic anhydride with sodium acetate or pyridine. In
addition, one laboratory was synthesizing phenylacetic acid as
well. </p>

<p>Recommendations for Action </p>

<p>(1) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting of all
sales of selected chemicals used in the production of controlled
substances, subject to public notice by the Administrator of DEA
that a particular chemical was selected for such control. This
would create a requirement similar to that affecting piperidine;
however, reporting would only be required for those chemicals
specified for a particular period of time. The requirement should
apply to the importing and exporting of the specified chemicals. </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted to empower the Administrator
of DEA or some other appropriate authority to identify and add
new chemicals to the list of those requiring reporting, as it
becomes known they are being used for the production of
controlled substances. </p>

<p>(3) That DEA identify the resources needed for the
computerization, analysis and follow up on reporting and that
those resources be acquired through the budget process. </p>

<p>Controlled Substance Analogs </p>

<p>As previously stated, the controlled substance analog problem
is not new. However, their wider illicit use and the greater
recognition of their use has heightened concern. There have been
three major types of analogs available in the United States:
analogs of PCP, analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine having
hallucinogenic properties, and the newer trend, analogs of
fentanyl and meperidine. There are, of course, hazards common to
all three groups. They are likely to contain toxic impurities.
Dosage is not consistent, i.e., one dose of a substance is likely
to contain a different amount of the active ingredient than
another. As a result, a single dose could contain a lethal amount
of the drug in question. Because they are analogs, they may well
produce toxic effects not caused by their parent drug. Another
critical consideration associated with designer drugs is the
difficulty of identifying them in the body. Recent testimony at a
Senate hearing indicated there are now only two laboratories in
the country, capable of identifying certain &quot;designer
drugs&quot; in body fluids, because standards for identifying the
drugs are not widely available. This creates two serious
problems: (1) Without the ability to detect and determine what
drugs are being used on the street it is impossible to even
identify that a problem exists let alone judge its magnitude; and
(2) without being able to determine positively what drugs has
been ingested, it is impossible to identify the correct antidote,
which in many cases could be a matter of life and death. </p>

<p>The Situation in More Detail </p>

<p>PCP was originally developed in the early 1950's as an
anesthetic for humans, but it was soon limited to veterinary use
because of its adverse side effects. Licit production ceased in
1978, and PCP is controlled in Schedule I of the Controlled
Substances Act, as are three of its analogs. They now are
recognized as having no medical use. The National Institute on
Drug Abuse has identified 35 other analogs, but none has
presented an abuse problem as far as is known. </p>

<p>Many analogs of amphetamine and methamphetamine are known to
have hallucinogenic affects. One receiving considerable media
attention recently, known on the street as &quot;Ecstasy,&quot;
is MDMA or 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine from the parent
compound MDA. Its psychopharmacological effects are similar to
those of MDA, altered consciousness, increased acoustic, visual
and tactile sensory perceptions and mild intoxication. There is
considerable concern among some experts that MDMA is likely to
cause damage to the serotonergic system, which has to do with
regulating sleep, mood, sexual activity and sensitivity to
aversive stimuli. The conclusion is based on research indicating
that MDA can selectively destroy serotonergic nerve terminals in
the rat brain. First recognized in the illicit traffic by DEA in
1970, MDMA was proposed for control under the Controlled
Substances Act in July 1984 because of increasing incidents of
discovery. However, because of rapidly mounting evidence of abuse
since then and possible serious neurological damage, the
emergency provisions contained in the Comprehensive Crime Control
Act of 1984 were used, and the drug was controlled as of July 1,
1985. </p>

<p>Fentanyl is widely used by the medical community as an
analgesic and anesthetic. It was first marketed in the United
States for this purpose in 1968 and is the most popular analgesic
used in surgical procedures in this country. There are likely
several hundred fentanyl analogs, many with pharmacological
properties similar to heroin or morphine but far more powerful.
The alpha-methyl analog was the first synthetic analog drug
recognized in the illicit traffic and was associated with
overdose deaths in California in 1979. Sold on the streets as
synthetic heroin, or &quot;China White,&quot; it was placed in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act in September 1981,
substantially eliminating its appearance in the illicit traffic.
DEA has identified seven additional fentanyl analogs in the
illicit traffic since then, however. Interestingly, two analogs
have not been recognized in the scientific literature. </p>

<p>There are two dramatic concerns related to the fentanyl
analogs: (1) their potency; and (2) their production/profit
margin. This second element will be of obvious importance to
traditional organized crime elements. Three methyl-fentanyl, the
latest analog to appear in the illicit market, is 3,000 times as
potent as morphine and has already been responsible for over a
dozen overdose deaths in the San Francisco Bay area alone. This
is the highest rate of fentanyl related deaths to date. Dosages
for fentanyl analogs are measured in micrograms and are likely to
be less than 1 percent of the dosage unit sold to the user. The
Drug Enforcement Administration has estimated that one kilogram
of fentanyl analog could be manufactured for under $2,000 and
that this amount might equal as many as 50 million dosage units,
with a street value exceeding one billion dollars. </p>

<p>Meperidine, a synthetic narcotic used to control pain, is
frequently used by heroin users when the street supply of heroin
is low. Meperidine, known more commonly by its trade name
&quot;Demerol,&quot; is in the Controlled Substances Act,
Schedule II. Two analogs of meperidine have been found in current
use. The first apparent MPPP (1-Methyl-4-Propionoxy piperidine)
abuse came to light in 1976 when a young man synthesized what he
thought was the analog for his own use. He soon sought treatment
for symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In revealing his drug use he
provided the formula and procedures he had used. Subsequent
analysis revealed he had, in fact, created MPTP. Additional
research by a National Institute of Health grantee showed that
MPTP had produced the Parkinson's type symptoms. MPPP was first
identified by a DEA laboratory in 1982; and samples of MPPP have
been discovered to contain the neurotoxic byproduct MPTP, formed
during the synthesis of MPPP. The neurological damage produced by
MPTP is irreversible and apparently worsens with time. The State
of California has identified more than 500 people who have used
MPTP; many users thought it was a new synthetic heroin. Twenty of
those involved have been permanently crippled. A group of seven
young addicts, who appeared at a California medical center
several years ago with symptoms resembling advanced Parkinson's
disease, were unable to move or talk. Treatment with
anti-Parkinson's therapy was, according to California
authorities, probably life saving, yet the patients continued to
be severely handicapped, requiring medication every one to three
hours just to be able to eat and drink. </p>

<p>The other meperidine analog with effects similar to heroin is
PePAP (l-(2-Phenylethyl)-4-Acetyloxpiperidine). The analgesic
potency of PePAP, measured in rodents, is described as from 12 to
72 times the potency of meperidine itself. This analog has so far
been discovered in California, although a clandestine laboratory
operation in Texas may have been attempting the process but did
not succeed. </p>

<p>Proposed Legislation </p>

<p>As mentioned at the outset of this discussion, unless the
specific chemical makeup of the substance being abused can be
determined by all laboratories regularly engaged in the analysis
of substances being abuse, serious problems could go unrecognized
for long periods, even years. Those who examine for and record
overdose deaths and injuries must likewise be able to determine
the abused substance involved. Further, that information must be
collected and analyzed at a central point. There is currently
only a limited mechanism for this collection (the NIDA DAWN
system). When a situation needing attention is discovered,
enforcement authorities must be empowered to act quickly. This
means that a mechanism must exist by which these &quot;designer
drugs&quot; can be controlled under the Controlled Substances Act
and appropriate State laws. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act
of 1984 does contain such a provision. Under that statute the
Administrator of DEA can bring a drug under Schedule I for up to
one year, with a six month extension where justified, and on
emergency basis, while the normal control mechanism is in
progress. The Administrator must decide that such scheduling is
necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to public safety. Control
of the substances occurs 30 days after public notice. The
efficacy of this legislation is yet undetermined, since it was
only first used in the Spring of 1985. </p>

<p>On July 16, 1985, a bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate, S.
1437, known as the &quot;Designer Drug Enforcement Act of
1985.&quot; This proposed legislation would make it a felony to
manufacture or distribute a designer drug for human consumption.
The proposed act, which would amend the Controlled Substance Act,
reads in part &quot;(31) The term 'designer drug' as used in
section 403A means a substance other than a controlled substance
that has a chemical structure substantially similar to that of a
controlled substance in Schedule I or II.&quot; During a Senate
hearing on the legislation by the Subcommittee on Children,
Family and Drugs and Alcoholism, July 25, 1985, both the DEA
Administrator and the Administrator of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse
and Mental Health Administration, supported the bill. </p>

<p>Recommended Actions </p>

<p>(1) That DEA provide assistance to the States in acquiring
laboratory standards for use in identifying &quot;designer
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>(2) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting by
anyone authorized to sign a death certificate, to an appropriate
Federal authority (perhaps the Public Health Service) of deaths
caused wholly or in part from the ingestion of any substance. </p>

<p>(3) That legislation be enacted requiring the reporting to an
appropriate Federal authority (DEA) by all laboratories
performing drug analysis for law enforcement purposes: (a) the
total amount of each controlled substance as defined in the
Controlled Substances Act, received for analysis each calendar
year, and (b) immediate notice of the receipt of samples of any
substance suspected of being or found to be a &quot;designer
drug&quot; as defined in the proposed bill. </p>

<ol>
    <li>That DEA formulate model &quot;designer drug&quot;
        legislation for the States as has been done for other
        aspects of the drug abuse problem. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 1: Drug Policy and Organized Crime </h2>

<p>Drug Policy and Organized Crime </p>

<p>By Professor Mark H. Moore. Submitted: January 3, 1986. Dr.
Mark H. Moore is Daniel and Guggenheim Professor of Criminal
Justice Policy and Management at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is
former Special Assistant to the Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. </p>

<p>Introduction: Drug Policy, Law Enforcement and Organized Crime
</p>

<p>Criminal laws prohibiting the production, distribution, and
possession of narcotics and dangerous drugs are the basis of drug
policy in the United States. These laws target the drugs that
have no recognized legitimate medical uses: heroin, cocaine,
marihuana, and hallucinogens. Enforcement efforts against these
drugs can be uncompromising, for there are no legitimate uses or
users to be protected. </p>

<p>Other drugs, however, pose similar threats to public health
and welfare, but they do have recognized legitimate uses. These
drugs include morphine, methadone, barbiturates, amphetamines,
and tranquilizers. With respect to these drugs the aim of the
legal regime and associated enforcement strategies is more
complex. It is not simply to eliminate the drugs but to preserve
a legitimate sector in which the benefits of these drugs may be
enjoyed, while minimizing illicit use. Towards this end the laws
license a limited number of people to produce, import, sell,
distribute and use them. To prevent the drugs from leaking from
and to illicit distributors and users, licensees have to secure
their inventories, and deal only with other licensees. To make
sure that the licensees meet these responsibilities, they must
keep records and make them available to investigators for
inspection. Failures to meet their responsibilities expose the
licensees to both civil and criminal penalties. To make sure that
no one can operate outside the boundaries of the legitimate
system, the unlicensed production, distribution or use of these
legitimate drugs is prohibited. </p>

<p>Drug Laws as a Comprehensive Drug Policy </p>

<p>It has become customary to think of the drug laws as operating
principally on the &quot;supply side&quot; of illegal drug
markets. For most practical purposes this is appropriate, for
these laws are the principal policy instruments directed at the
supply of illicit drugs. It is also generally true that the
principal targets of enforcement are suppliers rather than users.
However, these laws impose criminal liability on the illicit
possession and use of drugs, as well as to illicit production and
distribution. And indeed, each year more than 500,000 drug users
are arrested for possession. Therefore, criminal enforcement is
directed at the &quot;demand side&quot; of illicit drug use as
well as the &quot;supply side.&quot; To the extent that these
laws attack both the supply and the demand for illicit drugs,
they can be understood as a comprehensive drug policy, designed
to distinguish legitimate and useful drug use from illicit use
and to minimize illicit use in the society. </p>

<p>To produce this result, three different mechanisms are relied
on. One is the moral force of the law itself. To the extent that
individual citizens are guided in their decisions about drug use
by the explicit instruction provided by the law, or to the extent
that the existence of the law mobilizes widespread informal
interventions by parents, friends and relatives, the existence of
laws that define illicit use may succeed in reducing overall
levels of illicit use without any public enforcement activities. </p>

<p>A second, more widely understood mechanism is general
deterrence: the notion that citizens might be discouraged from
illicitly selling or using drugs by the fear that they will be
arrested and punished. This notion differs from the first in that
it depends on citizens' fears of punishment to motivate
compliance with the laws, rather than their desires to conform or
seek virtue. The more severe the penalties, and the higher the
probability of being caught, the more compliance will result. </p>

<p>A third mechanism is incapacitation: the notion that
imprisonment may physically prevent drug dealers and users from
continuing their activities. This concept differs from the second
in that it operates only on those dealers and users who are
caught, and only for as long as they remain under legal
supervision. If enough drug dealers and drug users are locked up,
then the problem of illicit drug dealing and drug use will
disappear. </p>

<p>Limitations of Drug Laws as a Drug Abuse Policy </p>

<p>To describe these mechanisms is to reveal the limitations of
the drug laws as a comprehensive drug abuse policy. The problem
is not that they are directed only at the &quot;supply side&quot;
of illegal drug abuse. Nor is it that they fail to produce
reductions in the level of illicit drug use. The problem is that
the drug laws are imperfectly effective. They leave behind a
residual market, composed of drug dealers and users, who failed
to get the message that they should abandon their drug
activities. Moreover, while the levels of drug distribution and
use that remain are undoubtedly lower than they would be in a
world of legalized drugs, the character of the market on both the
supply and the demand side are fundamentally altered and
generally worsened as a result of their illegality. </p>

<p>On the demand side the users who are not dissuaded from using
drugs discover that they confront high prices and low quality in
the drugs they buy. In addition, they are exposed to social
stigmatization and criminal prosecution. These circumstances
produce disastrous results for their economic status, physical
health, and social well-being. Of course, to the extent that
these consequences are unpleasant to the users, they provide a
continuing incentive for users to abandon their drug use. And, to
the extent that the users do so, an important social objective is
achieved. But to the extent they do not respond, their lives are
made miserable with little corresponding social benefit. The
society is left with drug users who are more dependent, dangerous
and unhealthy than they would otherwise be. </p>

<p>On the supply side the residual capacity takes the form of an
illicit industry. Some of that industry operates outside the
boundaries of the United States, and therefore to some degree
beyond the reach of its law. Another portion operates under the
cover of predominantly legal drug production and distribution -
within reach of the law, but a morally and legally ambiguous
target. The vast majority of the illicit industry, however,
consists of wholly illicit traffickers in the United States. </p>

<p>The Illicit Drug Industry: A Problem for Drug and Organized
Crime Policy </p>

<p>The existence of this illicit industry creates two different
kinds of problems. Viewed from the vantage point of drug abuse
policy, the principal problem created by the illicit industry is
that it continues to supply drugs to illicit markets. To the
extent that this continues, old drug users nay continue their
harmful activities, and new users may be recruited into dangerous
patterns of drug use. Thus, to achieve the objectives of drug
policy, the society must find ways to constrict the supply
capacities of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the vantage point of those concerned with the
control of organized crime, the existence of the illicit industry
creates a different kind of problem. To a degree, the illicit
drug industry engages in the sort of activities that make
organized crime a specially important social problem. Not only do
the illegal dealers frustrate the aims of drug policy by
continuing to supply drugs, but they grow rich in the process and
taunt the society with their financial success. Moreover, the
industry seems to spawn violence. Sometimes the violence spills
out into the general population. But even when the violence
remains confined to participants in the industry, its sheer
viciousness creates a general sense of lawlessness and brutality
that is threatening to the community. The illicit dealers also
seem to become heavily involved in corrupting government
agencies. Such activities undermine community security, and the
integrity of its basic institutions. Finally, the illicit drug
industry may gives birth to unusually large and powerful criminal
organizations, or nourish those that already exist. From the
vantage point of organized crime policy, then, the drug laws
create a major problem to be solved. </p>

<p>Drug Policy as a Portfolio of Policy Instruments </p>

<p>To deal with these side effects and residual problems, the
drug laws must be complemented by other policy instruments. To
deal with the limitations of drug laws in suppressing the demand
for drugs, a comprehensive drug policy necessarily includes drug
treatment and preventive education programs. Treatment programs
must be provided to help users make the transition to non-use and
to save lives that would otherwise be lost. Preventive education
programs must be operated to give more detailed explanations to
individuals of why illicit drug use is undesirable. Indeed, given
the focus of drug enforcement on the supply side of the market
and the obvious limitations of the drug laws in discouraging use
among those who are already dependent, it is generally
appropriate to think of drug treatment and education programs as
the principal instruments focused on the &quot;demand side&quot;
of the illicit drug markets. </p>

<p>To deal with the limitations of the laws in suppressing the
supply of illicit drugs and preventing the appearance of
organized criminal activity, traditional enforcement methods must
be supplemented by some special policy instruments. Diplomacy and
foreign aid must be joined to enforcement and regulation to reach
the pieces of the illicit supply system that operate outside the
United States. An effective regulatory enforcement system must be
created to prevent the diversion of narcotics and dangerous drugs
from legitimate to illicit markets in the United States. And
perhaps some special enforcement strategies that are effective in
constricting the capacity of the supply system to move drugs to
illicit markets or in dispersing well organized drug traffickers
must be designed and used. </p>

<p>The Objectives of the Paper </p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is not to design an effective
overall drug policy. Nor is it to consider the wisdom of relying
on criminal laws against drug distribution and use to the degree
we do now. My opinion is that our current drug policy is a wise
one, and that the balance of risks favors the continuation of
criminal laws directed against the distribution and use of
narcotics and dangerous drugs. </p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to take the existence of the current
drug laws and policies as a starting point and to design a
strategy to reduce supply consistent with the aims of our current
drugs abuse policy. In designing such a policy, special attention
will be given to the relationship between the strategy to reduce
supply that is necessary to achieve the goals of our current drug
abuse policy and organized crime policy. </p>

<p>As we have seen, there is some tension between these policies.
Making drug distribution illegal establishes fertile soil from
which existing organized crime groups might take sustenance or
new groups might arise. Thus, the continuing prohibitions of drug
distribution may exacerbate the organized crime problem. On the
other hand, to the extent that organized crime groups are now
active in producing or distributing drugs, and to the extent that
our organized crime policy makes available resources and
techniques that are effective in immobilizing such groups,
organized crime policy may make an important contribution to drug
policy. </p>

<p>In balancing these concerns the dominant emphasis will be
given to designing a supply reduction strategy that can achieve
the purpose of drug abuse policy. This perspective will be
adopted not because it is obvious that an effective drug control
policy is more important than an effective organized crime
policy, but simply because, if it were true that it was more
important to combat organized crime than to keep drugs from
illicit users, the simple solution would be to legalize the drugs
so that no illegal firms could arise. Since the society does not
choose this option, it must be that we are willing to pay a price
in terms of the objectives of organized crime policy to achieve
the objectives of drug control policy. The only interesting
questions, then, are how to minimize that price, and how best to
deploy the special resources and capabilities or organized crime
control policies to further the objectives of drug policy. That
is what we will try to discover. </p>

<p>The Analytic Framework </p>

<p>As we have seen, the character of the illicit drug industry is
important to the ultimate success of both drug abuse policy, and
organized crime control policy. To define objectives, set
reasonable expectations for success, and guide strategic choices
in targeting supply reduction efforts, an analysis of the illicit
drug industry is essential. </p>

<p>The Crucial Distinction Between the &quot;Industry&quot; and
the &quot;Firms&quot; </p>

<p>In carrying out this analysis, it is important to distinguish
the concept of the industry from the concept of individual firms
within the industry. The industry includes everyone who is
engaged in producing, importing, or distributing narcotics and
dangerous drugs to illicit markets in the United States. A firm
within that industry is nothing more than a collection of assets
whose specific uses are determined by the authoritative decisions
of an identifiable organizational unit. </p>

<p>Obviously, the firms that make up the industry could take a
variety of forms. They could represent different production
capacities, such as a boat, a person who knows the chemistry to
produce psychoactive drugs, or $50,000 in cash. They could be
involved in all aspects of the deal from financing through
production, transportation, and distribution, or they could
specialize in only one of these functions. For any given function
the firm may be more or less dominant in more or less local
geographic markets. They could consist of a single entrepreneur
linked to others only through the fragile ties of economic
interest, or they could include many people linked to one another
by family or cultural ties. They could be relative newcomers or
have a long history in the industry. They could enter the
industry with hopes for a single, big score, or they could plan
to become or remain a permanent fixture. </p>

<p>Often, the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it is blurred, and the industry is viewed as a single
firm. This casual assumption is justified on one of two different
grounds. One is that the observed performance of the illicit
market is so impressive in terms of its operations and
adaptability that it is hard to believe that it is not guided by
a single intelligence. Nothing short of a single coherent
enterprise could accomplish the enormously complicated tasks of
collecting raw materials, processing then, and transporting the
finished product through the mine fields created by enforcement
agencies. Nor could anything other than an enterprise guided by a
single intelligence adapt successfully to the frequent changes in
supply reduction strategies. </p>

<p>The problem with this argument is that legitimate industries
accomplish similar feats of production, distribution and
adaptation all the time without a single intelligence guiding
them. The reason legitimate industries are successful is that
there are many guiding intelligences, but none predominant. The
aggregate result of the individual choices made by individual
economic actors may look organized in the sense that the industry
gradually moves from places where enforcement has become heavy to
areas where it is weaker, or it shifts from one drug to another
depending on consumer demand. But this orderly response need not
be the result of a wise choice by a single, powerful firm. It
could be the natural result of the firms in the heavily enforced
areas being wiped out, and the firms in the less heavily enforced
areas growing to meet the demand. In short, the adaptations are
made at the expense of individual firms, not under their control
- nor, necessarily, to their advantage. </p>

<p>The second line of argument supporting the notion that the
industry should be viewed as a single firm is somewhat more
sophisticated. It is based on the hypothesis that some illicit
firms will develop crucial specialized capabilities, and that
these will give the firm important advantages in producing and
distributing illegal drugs, or effective control over others who
do. These special capabilities could be access to capital,
connections with foreign sources of raw materials, knowledge of
how to produce the drugs, a special tie to corrupt officials, or
a general capacity for disciplined violence that could be brought
to bear on anyone who produced or distributed drugs without their
permission. This argument depends essentially on the idea that
there are some natural economies of scale in the illicit
industry, and that these will tend to produce a concentrated
industry. This is a more powerful kind of argument than the
first, but it is only an assertion. It needs to be examined with
both logic and evidence. </p>

<p>The Analysis of Industrial Organization </p>

<p>The form of analysis that is appropriate is an analysis of
industrial organization. An analysis of this kind rigorously
maintains the distinction between the industry and the firms that
comprise it. Indeed, the principal objective of an analysis of
industrial organization is to understand the relationships among
the structure of the industry, the conduct of the firms within
the industry, and the long run performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Structure. The concept of industry
&quot;structure&quot; explicitly captures the distinction between
the industry and the firms that comprise it. It focuses attention
on how the activities of the overall industry are divided among
different organizational units called Firms. One key concern in
examining structure is the degree of concentration in the
industry. The fewer the firms, the more concentrated the
industry. A second is the extent of horizontal and vertical
integration. Integration refers to the proportion of activities
essential to creating a product and delivering it to a market
that are contained within a single firm. Vertical integration is
measured by the extent to which a firm includes all the steps
from extraction of raw materials to final sales to ordinary
consumers. Horizontal integration is measured by the proportion
of a given step in the production and distribution of a product
that is controlled by a single firm. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Conduct. &quot;Conduct&quot; refers
to the distinctive ways that the firms within the industry go
about their business. Specific questions might focus on the
production technologies now commonly utilized, major factors
influencing costs within the industry, levels of investment in
research and development, the rate at which new products are
introduced, or the geographic organization of the industry's
markets. Conduct might also be concerned with institutional
relationships in the industry; e.g., the competitive strategies
being pursued by firms within the industry, the relationships
with governmental regulators, and even patters of collective
bargaining and labor relations. </p>

<p>The Definition of Industry Performance.
&quot;Performance&quot; focuses on the question of how successful
the industry is over the long run in delivering a product at low
cost, expanding the market, and adapting to changing
circumstances. Performance is ultimately what an industry analyst
is trying to understand. Indeed, the observations about structure
and conduct are made principally to explain and predict
performance. The more decentralized and competitive the industry,
and the lower the costs of bringing new products or new
production technologies on line, the more adaptable and dynamic
the industry. The larger the economies of scale in operating,
marketing, or bringing new products or production technologies on
line, the more concentrated the industry is likely to be. The
more concentrated the industry, the higher the prices and the
slower the rate of innovation. Propositions such as these link
observations of structure and conduct to explanations and
predictions of performance. </p>

<p>Objectives in Attacking the Illicit Drug Industry </p>

<p>To a great extent this framework of analysis can be carried
over and used in examining the character of the illicit drug
industry. But some crucial differences are worth noting. By far
the most important is that the implicit evaluative perspective
reverses when we are analyzing illicit industries. </p>

<p>An Evaluative Perspective. In standard industry analyses one
generally hopes for high performance from the industry. The more
successful it is in delivering products at low prices, expanding
its market to new areas, adapting to changing economic
circumstances, and maintaining high rates of innovation, the
better the result for the society. </p>

<p>In the case of the illicit drug industry, of course, the
society's hopes run in the opposite direction. High performance
from the illicit drug industry means that it adapts well to
government efforts to eliminate it and continues to supply drugs
at low cost to illicit markets. Over the long run, this means
higher levels of illicit drug use. In analyzing the illicit drug
market, then, what one hopes for is a failing industry: one that
cannot overcome the hurdles set by the government in trying to
get its products to market. These hopes are generally frustrated
by the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of illicit
entrepreneurs in pursuit of money. Nonetheless, one keeps hoping
that this industry will stumble rather than flourish. Indeed,
making it fail is an explicit purpose of public policy. </p>

<p>A second important difference is that in the analysis of the
illegal drug industry, the structure and conduct of the industry
have an elevated importance. As noted above, in traditional
analyses of industrial organization, structure and conduct have
importance primarily as factors that influence the performance of
the industry. In the analysis of the illegal drug industry, they
retain that importance: to the extent that structure and conduct
enhance or hinder the industry's long-run performance in
delivering drugs to illicit markets at low prices, they are a
source of interest, and a possible target of enforcement actions.
</p>

<p>What increases the importance of structure and conduct in the
analysis of illegal drug markets, however, is that they are
valued by the society independently of their impact on the
performance of the industry. Crucial questions about the conduct
of the firms within the illegal drug industry include the extent
to which they rely on violence to maintain internal discipline or
eliminate competition, and the extent to which they rely on
corruption to ward off the threat of enforcement. To the extent
that they do rely on violence and corruption as essential
elements of their business, their conduct has importance to the
society quite apart from how these practices affect their ability
to supply drugs. </p>

<p>Similarly, the society seems to be deeply concerned about the
structure of the illicit drug industry. Specifically, the society
seems to regard the problem as worse if the industry is highly
concentrated and composed of a few large, durable firms than if
it were less concentrated and populated by smaller and more
transient firms. No doubt, this view derives primarily from a
dominant concern about the performance of the industry, and an
assumption that an illicit industry, composed of a few large and
durable firms, would be more effective over the long run in
supplying drugs at low cost to consumers. It is important to keep
in mind, however, that a highly concentrated industry might
perform less well over the long run in delivering drugs to
illicit markets than a more atomistic market. Economic theory
tells us that prices would be higher in a concentrated market,
and it is quite possible that innovativeness and adaptability to
attacks would be less. The firms might represent more formidable
enforcement targets, but the result of dismantling them might be
larger and more durable than would be true in an atomistic
market. </p>

<p>Even if this were true, however, it seems likely that the
society would still regard an illicit industry, composed of a few
large, durable firms, as worse than one composed of many small
transient firms. The reason is that large, durable firms
constitute a social problem independent of their ability to
supply drugs. Large, durable criminal organizations can bring
much more powerful pressures to bear on their employees,
competitors, the government officials who are pledged to attack
them, and even the communities in which they operate than could
smaller or more transient firms. It is partly that the large,
durable firms become very wealthy; partly that they can maintain
truly frightening capacities for disciplined violence; but
perhaps most fundamentally that they will be around for a long
time and therefore able to reward cooperation and punish
opposition that makes them so powerful. </p>

<p>Thus, the concepts of structure, conduct and performance help
to clarify the society's objectives in dealing with the illicit
drug industry. The concerns of drug abuse policy are captured
principally by questions about the performance of the industry,
since it is the long run performance of the industry that will
decisively shape overall levels of drug abuse. The concerns of
organized crime policy are captured principally by questions
about conduct and structure. The concept of conduct captures the
concern about levels of violence and corruption associated with
an illegal industry. The concept of structure captures the
special concerns that are raised for organized crime policy by
the existence of very large, durable organizations, whose wealth,
disciplined use of violence, and long memories make them
especially powerful. A successful supply reduction strategy,
then, would leave an illicit drug industry, which is high cost,
ineffective in supplying drugs to illicit markets, not very
adaptable, reluctant to rely on bribery and violence, and
composed of small, transient firms. </p>

<p>Competition among Objectives. We are accustomed to thinking
that any supply reduction strategy will move us towards improved
performance on all of these objectives, and therefore there are
no trade-offs between the objectives of drug abuse policy and
organized crime control policy. We have already seen that there
is a certain tension between the aims of these two different
policies insofar as the criminal laws against drug distribution
and use create the basic conditions under which an illicit
industry night arise. But now it is possible to see a new tension
as well, one that is not only between drug abuse policy and
organized crime control objectives, but also between different
objectives of organized crime control policy. </p>

<p>Ironically, a supply reduction strategy that increased the
degree of concentration in the illicit industry might achieve
some important objectives of a supply reduction strategy.
Economic theory predicts, for example, that the actual supply of
drugs will be less in a concentrated industry than in a more
decentralized competitive industry. It is also likely that the
violence would be less, or at least more disciplined and focused
on those who were actually involved in the industry in a tightly
organized, concentrated industry. Thus, a supply reduction
strategy might succeed in reducing the overall performance of the
industry and even changing its conduct to reliance on threats and
bribery rather than overt violence, but do so only at the price
of increasing the size, power, and durability of criminal
organizations. Whether this would be preferred to a strategy that
reduced the concentration in the industry, but enhanced its
performance and shifted its conduct to more random patterns of
violence depends on how the society values these competing
objectives, and how much improved performance and violence it
would have to accept as the price of reduced concentration. That
would be a difficult choice. </p>

<p>The Definition of Improvements. At any rate, the directions in
which improvement lie, are clear, and so are the objectives of a
supply reduction strategy. The first and most important objective
is to frustrate the performance of the illicit industry - to
constrict its capacity to supply drugs to illicit markets. The
second is to shape the conduct of the residual industry so that
it is less violent and less corrupting. The third is to disperse
the industry so that the firms that comprise it are small and
transient rather than large and durable. How are one can go in
achieving these objectives, and how sharp the trade-offs among
them can only be answered by a close look at the factors that
shape the structure, conduct and performance of the industry. </p>

<p>Major Factors Shaping the Industry </p>

<p>As in any industry performance is determined at least partly
by engineering or mechanical factors: e.g., the physical
requirements of production and distribution. To get drugs to
illegal markets, firms must have access to raw materials, have
the knowledge and the equipment required to transform the raw
materials into finished products, be able to maintain and protect
inventories, and be able to transport finished products to
individual markets. </p>

<p>In addition, the performance of the industry will be shaped by
economic factors: i.e., the perceptions of opportunities and
risks. Those who make investments of the time and energy in
producing or diverting raw materials, in learning the techniques
and acquiring the equipment for producing illegal drugs, in
storing and transporting the drugs, and so on, must have some
assurance that they will make money from their investments. They
must have some capital to give them the time and the capacity to
arrange the deals that will ultimately produce satisfactory
returns. They must also have a certain tolerance for risk - not
only the risk that they might be imprisoned for their activities,
but also that they might take economic losses as a result of
successful enforcement actions against them, betrayals by their
associates, or more common economic disasters, such as
shipwrecks, plane crashes, spoiled production runs, or sudden
changes in exchange rates. Unless there is a reasonable chance in
their minds that they can make enough money from illicit drug
deals to compensate them for their time and their risks, the
deals will not be made. </p>

<p>A third factor influencing performance is the structure of
criminal liability that surrounds the industry, for it is the
laws and the way that they are enforced that determines many of
the opportunities and risks facing illicit drug dealers. A simple
way to think about how this factor operates is to think of the
criminal laws and the specific methods of enforcement as a kind
of tax confronting the illegal dealers. To maximize their return,
they seek to avoid as much of the tax as possible. They do this
by avoiding activities that are heavily taxed, by taking
advantage of loopholes in the tax laws or weakness in
enforcement, by concealing as much of their operation from the
tax collectors as possible, or by corrupting the tax collectors.
Such activities affect both the scale and the character of the
illicit industry. </p>

<p>The Apparent Influence of Geography </p>

<p>Geography looks like a factor that plays an important role in
determining the conduct and performance of the illicit industry.
Indeed, much of our thinking about supply reduction strategies is
guided by the notion that there are important &quot;source
countries&quot; that become the targets of diplomatic and
enforcement initiatives. Thus, for many years, Turkey and France
were regarded as the principal sources of heroin, although they
have now been replaced by Mexico and Southeast Asia. Similarly,
Colombia is now considered the principal source of cocaine, and
Jamaica a primary source of marijuana. </p>

<p>The reason that geography seems important is that different
countries represent different clusters of conditions that give
them a comparative advantage as a supplier of drugs to illicit
markets in the United States. Sometimes a country becomes an
important source country because of agricultural conditions that
make it an especially attractive (perhaps even unique) place in
which to produce raw materials. Thus, for a while, we imagine
that opium poppies could be successfully grown in only a few
countries in the world, and we now hope this is true of coca
leaves. In short, a country may become an importance source of
supply due to a physical advantage. </p>

<p>Other times it seems that a country has become a major source
as the result of a long tradition of producing the relevant raw
materials, or a large domestic industry that is based on them. In
effect, the country has a unique institutional and economic
advantage because it has a large infrastructure already invested
in the cultivation of the opium, coca leaves, or marijuana. </p>

<p>Still other times, it seems that the country's advantage comes
from week laws governing the legitimate or illicit drug
industries, or weak governmental commitment and capacity for
controlling the illicit drug industry. Just as Las Vegas can
become the center of gambling simply by establishing a legal
regime that tolerates it, Jamaica may become a principal source
of marijuana by being particularly lax with respect to the
suppression of illicit cultivation. </p>

<p>Thus, while geography looks like it plays an important
independent role in determining the character of the illicit drug
markets, this apparent influence actually derives from the more
basic causes already noted: the physical relations governing
production and distribution, the economic/ institutional
relations that give economic actors reasonable assurances that
investments in particular activities will be rewarded, and the
legal regime that has an independent effect on the risks and
opportunities confronting illicit dealers. Thus, geography may
drop out of any close analysis of the factors shaping the
performance of the illicit supply system, and be replaced by a
separate consideration of how certain countries seem to represent
unusually favorably combinations of the underlying causal
factors, and which ones seem particularly important. </p>

<p>The Irrelevance of Physical Requirements </p>

<p>While it is tempting to search for the explanation of the
structure, conduct and performance of the illicit industry in the
physical mechanics of producing and distributing drugs, there is
very little in these relationships that is unusual, or that could
constrain or shape the performance of the industry. Many of the
raw materials necessary to produce narcotics and dangerous drugs
are widely available. This is true primarily because they have
many legitimate uses, but also simply because they can be grown
or artificially produced in many different locations. Of course,
and occasional local shortage in basic raw materials may sometime
appear. But, given the alternative sources of supply, it is hard
to imagine that the shortage would last. Indeed, it is hard to
imagine long run shortages in the availability of opium poppies,
marijuana, coca leaves, or even chemicals used to produced
synthetic opiates, hallucinogens, and other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p>It is equally difficult to imagine that either the knowledge
or the equipment necessary for manufacturing illicit drugs could
be in long run short supply. The chemical structure of the
illicit drugs are well known. Indeed, they are so well known that
illicit labs are now experimenting with small manipulations of
the chemical structure of existing drugs to determine if the
newly created drugs will produce similar or superior psychoactive
effects. These so-called &quot;designer drugs&quot; challenge the
legal regime regulating drugs because they may be legal to
produce and distribute until enough experience has accumulated to
declare them a significant abuse threat. </p>

<p>The equipment required for the production of the drugs is also
commonplace. Indeed, heroin &quot;labs&quot; in Mexico often
consisted of little more than wash-tubs and rubber hoses. And the
drugs can be made in many different quantities with few
implications for the costs of production. So, there seems to be
little in the technology of production that would have a decisive
impact on the structure, conduct or performance of the industry. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Industry Conduct </p>

<p>My strong conviction is that the dominant factor shaping the
illicit drug industry is the simple fact that it is illicit. This
fact has broad and significant implications for its structure,
conduct and performance. The immediate consequences of
illicitness register in the conduct of the illicit firms, but the
changes in conduct have important implications for structure and
performance. </p>

<p>The Risk of Arrest. The most obvious consequence of
illicitness is that those who produce, import, distribute or use
drugs illegally are exposed to the threat of arrest, prosecution
and imprisonment. Moreover, in some countries, they are
threatened by the seizure of any property or assets used in their
illegal drug dealing - a threat whose significance may dwarf not
only any fine they may receive, but also some jail terms. </p>

<p>The obvious effect of threatening illicit producers,
distributors and users with jail is that the dealers who remain
in the business will take steps to reduce their risks, or to
compensate themselves for the risks of being is the business. The
principal devices for reducing risks are to keep operations
secret so that enforcement agencies cannot discover them, or to
corrupt the agencies so that even if their operations are
discovered, they are not punished. The principal devices used to
keep their operations secret are to deal with a small number of
people, to conceal the traces of their activities, and to screen
and discipline their employees, associates and customers to make
sure they are not undercover agents, and do not become police
informants. The principal ways of corrupting enforcement agencies
are to offer money to be allowed to continue to operate, and to
inform on their competitors and associates so that the police can
make arrests without harming their operations. </p>

<p>Such efforts can only be partially effective in eliminating
the risk of punishment. To deal in large quantities of drugs and
make money from the enterprise, one must inevitably deal with a
large number of people, only some of whom are trusted and
effectively disciplined. Thus, the risk of informants and
undercover agents among one's employees, associates or customers
is always present. Similarly, drug dealing always involves
leaving traces of one's activities that cannot be entirely
concealed: physical inventories of raw materials or drugs,
records of financial transactions, even records of phone calls
among the conspirators. These, too, are vulnerable to discovery
by enforcement agencies. Also, there are so many agencies and
agents involved in drug enforcement activities that one can never
be sure whether all those who pose a threat have been corrupted.
Since the risk can never be quite eliminated, the dealer's
response is to demand additional compensation for the risks in
trafficking drugs. He demands higher prices for drugs than he
would if there was no risk of going to jail. </p>

<p>The Risk of Rip-Offs. A less obvious but by no means less
important consequences of the illicit status of drug production,
importation and distribution is that illegal dealers are
confronted by threats from other criminals as well as by
enforcement agencies. Indeed, associates, competitors and
ordinary armed robbers probably create greater risks for illicit
drug dealers than enforcement agencies. Partly this is because
dealers are very tempting targets. They are likely to have large
amounts of cash, or large quantities of drugs that can be
converted to cash. Also, they are unlikely to turn to enforcement
agencies to help protect their operations. They have to supply
protection against armed attack or stealing. Those in the
criminal milieu may know more than enforcement agencies about who
is &quot;holding&quot; or currently doing business, and these
other criminals may be less constrained by the niceties of due
process than the enforcement agencies. Thus, other criminals may
be more strongly motivated and better positioned to attack
illegal drug dealers than the enforcement agencies, and therefore
pose a graver threat to the illicit dealers. </p>

<p>The implications of this fact are that the dealers must make
special provisions to protect themselves from this threat. To a
degree, the same methods of secrecy and discipline may be as
helpful against other crooks as against the police. But it seems
likely that the threat from other crooks is more apt to be met by
capacities for violence. In general, if an armed confrontation
between the dealers and enforcement agencies occurs, the dealers
know they will lose. They may win a local fire-fight, but there
is no way they can compete over the long run with enforcement
agencies in violent confrontations. Consequently, they rely most
heavily on secrecy and corruption to deal with the threat of
enforcement. </p>

<p>With other criminals, however, the balance of armed power is
less clear. Thus, it is tempting to build capacities for violence
to protect oneself and one's business from &quot;take-off&quot;
artists, and to establish credible threats effective against
betrayals by associates. This capacity for violence can also be
used externally to drive out competitors. But the vulnerability
to other criminals associated with illicitness provides the most
immediate and compelling justification for developing a capacity
for violence, as well as for secrecy and corruption. The
existence of these capacities for violence among dealers and
those who would steal from them produces the bulk of the violence
within the illegal drug industry. </p>

<p>Thus, the conduct of the firms within the illicit industry is
profoundly influenced by the fact of their illicitness. They are
forced to maintain secrecy, and to prevent the infiltration of
police agents. They must develop capacities to bribe, suborn, or
mislead government agents. Also they must develop capacities for
violence to enforce contracts with associates, protect their
property from armed robbers, and to discipline employees.
Finally, because the risks of arrest or rip-offs cannot ever
wholly be eliminated, they must price their products not only to
cover costs, but also to compensate themselves for the risk of
arrest or financial loss they are taking by engaging in such a
risky business. These effects on the conduct of firms have
implications for structure and performance. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Structure </p>

<p>The consequences of illicit status for the structure of the
illicit industry are hard to estimate, for they will be
determined by a balance of conflicting influences. On one hand,
the desire to prevent the police and other criminals from
learning about their operation will motivate illicit
entrepreneurs to keep their small firms, transient, and neither
vertically nor horizontally integrated. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Small Firms and Decentralization. Smallness has
the virtues of involving only a small number of people and a
small number of transactions. This implies both that the
intrinsic vulnerability of the operations is less, and that the
contributions of any special efforts to discipline or secure the
operation will go further because there are fewer associates,
employees or transactions over which to spread these efforts. </p>

<p>Transience has similar advantages to smallness. If the
problems for illicit dealers is to avoid others knowing they are
in business, they can accomplish this by getting into the
business and out of it before anyone knows who they are. Indeed,
from the perspective of avoiding detection, the best operation is
one that is both small and transient. But that firm is not worth
disrupting, also, for it could never amount to much in terms of
its ability to supply drugs, its contribution to violence and
corruption, or to become a powerful institution to the community.
</p>

<p>Vertical and horizontal disintegration also have important
advantages in avoiding detection. A vertically integrated firm
would require some system of information-gathering and
record-keeping to exploit the advantages of explicit coordination
across the different phases of the operation. But these records
would become an important source of evidence against the dealers.
Similarly, almost by definition, vertically integrated firm would
be large and involve many transactions, and each element of the
firm would know what other elements were doing. Thus, a
vertically integrated firm would present more possible points of
penetration and would be much more vulnerable to any given
penetration, than a firm organized as a set of largely separate
cells that operated relatively autonomously. </p>

<p>Similarly, a horizontally integrated firm would also have to
be large and would have to be in contact with all firms engaged
in the activities at other stages of the production process.
Thus, a horizontally integrated firm in the business of
off-loading mother ships would come to know the principal
importing firms that arranged for the mother ships to appear off
the coast, and the principal firms engaged in storage and
distribution. This would make such a firm vulnerable to betrayal
by the others, compared with a firm that handled less of the
overall off-loading business. </p>

<p>Thus, to escape detection, firms in the illicit drug industry
would choose to be small, transient and disintegrated. This, in
turn, would lead to a highly fragmented - even atomistic -
structure in the industry. </p>

<p>The Virtues of Scale and Concentration. On the other hand, it
is possible there are some economies of scale in the production
and distribution of illicit drugs, or some opportunities for
controlling competition that would lead to relatively large,
durable firms, and a relatively high degree of concentration in
the industry. Ironically, the principal potential for economies
of scale do not seem to lie in the areas of production or
marketing. Instead they lie in the development of capacities for
corruption and violence that will give some firms special
opportunities to operate safely and efficiently in the dangerous
illicit markets. </p>

<p>The capacity for disciplined, irresistible violence may be a
particularly important factor of production in illicit supply
systems, and may be an area where there are natural economies of
scale. As we have seen, a capacity for violence is terribly
important in disciplining employees to keep then from becoming
informants. It is also important in being able to enforce
contracts with business associates and in protecting life and
property from other criminals in a world where one cannot rely on
the ordinary courts and police to perform this function.
Moreover, once developed for these purposes, the capacity for
violence can become important in eliminating competition, or
forcing it to be small and transient rather than large and
durable. For all these reasons, a firm had a substantial capacity
for violence would have an obvious competitive advantage in
supply drugs to illicit markets. </p>

<p>To argue that violent firms would have a competitive advantage
is not quite the same as saying that the obvious value of a
capacity for violence will tend to produce large, durable firms,
and a concentrated structure in the industry. That argument rests
on an additional assertion that there are economies of scale in
the development of this special capacity for violence. This
assertion, in turn, rests on the ideal that a useful capacity for
violence consists not in the production of actual violence, but
instead in a reputation for irresistible violence that can
overwhelm (in force, viciousness, sustainability or all three)
any degree of violence that another illegal entrepreneur can
imagine mounting. This is important, for it is quite obvious that
real violence can be produced quite easily and inexpensively.
What is valuable violence, however, is violence that need not be
used but will still intimidate and discourage others because it
is there to be used and cannot be successfully resisted. To have
this capacity, a firm must have available not only a large
quantity of violence and demonstrate its willingness to use it,
but also be a sufficiently permanent and relentless institution
so that the possibility of an opponent challenging it and
escaping without retaliation seems remote. </p>

<p>This capacity seems to have some natural monopolistic
features. One can easily imagine how a single organization could
gradually corner the market for irresistible violence and create
a fairly impregnable local monopoly. One can less easily but
still plausibly imagine a small number of firms with such
capabilities co-existing in an uneasy truce, and ignoring a
certain number of violations of their tacit understandings, as
well as a small amount of minor competition from transient
outsiders. What is hard to imagine as a stable equilibrium is a
world in which there are large numbers of closely matched firms
vying for the position of a recognized dominant capacity for
violence. In that world the factor of production that has value -
namely, a dominating capacity for violence that is sufficient to
discipline employees, enforce contracts, and protect reliably
against take-offs - is not available to any firm. Each firm is
therefore vulnerable to all threats that a solid reputation for
irresistible violence would guard against. </p>

<p>If the reputation for irresistible violence is valuable, it
takes substantial investment to build the capabilities, and if it
only has value when it is greater than any other competing
firm's, the importance of this factor of production will tend to
produce high degrees of concentration in the industry. This will
lead to the development of a few large, durable firms in any
local market. This is true at least in part because this
reputation for violence can substitute for a small scale in
preventing the detection of the operation. If employees,
associates, competitors and customers are all afraid to give
information about the operations of a firm to the police or other
criminals, then it can operate at any given scale with less risk
than another firm that is similar in all respects other than its
capacity and reputation for violence. </p>

<p>The capacity for corrupting government officials may also be
an important factor of production and distribution. This might
also be an important factor of production and distribution that
might also tend to create larger more durable firms and higher
degrees of concentration than one might hypothesize, if one were
thinking only of how the illicit firms might escape detection.
The easiest way to think about the problem of corruption is to
imagine that the various government officials and agencies,
responsible for enforcing laws against illegal production and
distribution, have a de facto power to grant a license to illegal
entrepreneurs to operate legally - or at least with no treat from
them. Obviously, the value of this license to the illicit dealers
depends on the extent to which a given official or agency
monopolizes the legal threat to them. If a given official or
agency is the only official threat against an illicit dealer, the
value of his protection will obviously be higher than if the
official threat against an illicit dealer, the value of his
protection will obviously be higher than if the official or agent
is only one of many potential threats against the dealer. </p>

<p>Thus, the question of whether corruption will tend to
concentrate in the industry depends crucially on the organization
of the enforcement agencies. If the enforcement agencies were
organized in a single agency, and if the hierarchical control
within the agencies was very powerful, and if the illicit firm
could corrupt that agency, it would be able to gain and hold a
monopoly in the area principally by using the enforcement agency
to help it eliminate competition, while keeping it safe. If, on
the other hand, the enforcement agencies had fragmented
jurisdictions, and quite imperfect control over their agents,
then they might be more vulnerable to some degree of corruption,
but the significance of the corruption would be much less.
Essentially, the enforcement agency could not sell an exclusive
right to operate safely. It could only sell little pieces of
insurance against threats from specific agents or agencies. Even
this would produce some higher degree of concentration in the
industry than if corruption were not part of the operating
strategies of the illicit firms, since it would establish some
barriers to entry and protect the position of some firms. But it
would by no means guarantee a monopoly. </p>

<p>The Net Result of Conflicting Pressures. Therefore, there are
pressures that push the drug industry towards small firms and an
atomistic structure, and others that are consistent with the
development of local monopolies and relatively concentrated
structures. My strong hunch is that the net result of this will
be to produce an illicit industry that includes a heterogeneous
distribution of firms. There will be a few firms that are in
strong position to exploit the economies of scale that come from
a reputation for trustworthiness, and for irresistible violence
in the case of betrayal. Such firms may come to account for a
relatively large fraction of the drugs reaching illicit markets,
but they will be a small fraction of the total number of firms
operating. This will be true partly because it is unlikely that
these firms will become either horizontally or vertically
integrated. The risks of long chains of command in the case of
vertical integration, or a wide network of contacts in the case
of horizontal integration are apt to be much greater than the
potential benefits. It is also true because these firms will not
be able to prevent (and will not find it worth preventing)
occasional competition from transient or small operations which
have their own sources of supply, and their own local markets.
Therefore, there will be a great many firms of different sizes in
the industry. </p>

<p>If one were thinking about analogies from legitimate
industries, my hunch is that the best analogy might be something
like the real estate industry, rather than the auto industry or
even the fast-food industry. Many developers put together large,
uncertain deals, rather than producing or distribution a product.
Moreover, the deals are likely to involve several different
partners, and the partnerships and roles may change from deal to
deal. Those in the industry who have a reputation for
trustworthiness, &quot;deep-pockets,&quot; strong political
connections, and effective lawyers are likely to account for a
large fraction of the total dollar value of the deals made. But
there will be a great many others in the industry who do smaller
deals. </p>

<p>The Impact of Illicitness on Performance </p>

<p>Because illicitness affects conduct and structure, it also has
an enormously importantly impact on industry performance. The
crucial result is that drug prices are much higher than they
otherwise would be. This is partly because the defensive
strategies mounted by dealers against enforcement agencies and
other criminals translate into higher operating costs per unit of
drug delivered, and partly because dealers demand additional
compensation for their risks. This is shown by the fact that the
price of drugs in illicit markets is higher than the price of
equivalent drugs in legal markets by factors of 20 or 30. </p>

<p>Almost as important is that the drugs are less conveniently
available than they otherwise would be. Dealers have an incentive
to conceal their activities rather than advertise then. Growth in
the market tends to happen within intimate networks of friends,
rather than through public advertising and widespread
availability. In all likelihood, these are slower and less
effective methods of market development than the same mechanisms
joined with a legitimate distribution system. </p>

<p>We can combine the effect on price and the effect on
availability in a single concept called the &quot;effective
price&quot; of drugs in illicit markets. That would include not
only the monetary cost, but also the amount of time a customer
would have to spend looking for the drug, and the chance that he
might fail to find the drug, or be cheated by an unscrupulous
dealer. In these terms, illicitness results in much higher
effective prices for illicit drugs than if they were legal. Note
that this is probably true even if publicly supported enforcement
activities were relatively ineffective. For, even if the threat
from the enforcement agencies were removed, the threat from other
criminals would remain, and that by itself would be enough by
itself to increase dramatically the effective prices of illicit
drugs. So illicitness has a profound impact on the performance of
the industry. </p>

<p>The fact that the price of drugs is increased by the illicit
status of the industry is evaluated in different ways from
different vantage points. Viewed from the perspective of drug
abuse policy, this is desireable because it will reduce overall
levels of drug use in the population by discouraging new users
from continuing their drug use, and motivating older users to
seek treatment and abandon their use. Viewed from the perspective
of organized crime policy, the increased prices mean a larger
flow of revenues to illicit dealers and criminal organizations.
This is damaging to the objectives of organized crime policy, for
it creates the impression that crime pays, and provides the
necessary financial means to enlarge illegal operations, or to
consolidate a position vis-a-vis other criminal organizations or
the enforcement agencies. Regardless of whether the economic
proceeds are used by illegal dealers for consumption or
investment, the higher revenues become a problem for organized
crime policy. </p>

<p>It is also possible that over the long run, the higher
revenues become a problem for drug abuse policy. This would be
true, for example, if the conspicuous consumption of wealthy drug
dealers attracted more people into the industry, or if the
investments made by more disciplined dealers allowed them not
only to dominate the supply system, but to increase its overall
capacity to supply drugs. In each case, the revenues from the
industry would be operating to increase the overall supply
capacity of the system, just as excess profits in a legitimate
industry would attract new investment into that industry. </p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that the reasons
that prices are high in the drug industry is precisely because
dealers are confronted by risks of violence and financial loss
from both the government and other criminals. This fact remains
true and continues to discourage many from entering the business.
Indeed, the greater the risks, the greater the profits must be to
attract any one into the business. That is the explicit purpose
of making the drug business illegal and attacking it
aggressively. As long as that threat remains substantial, the
overall supply capacity of the industry will be much smaller than
otherwise, even though people in the industry are making money.
People do not flock to the industry, even with high prices and
high revenues, because the risks are also high.<br>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Part 2: The Impact of the Legitimate Drug
System </h2>

<p>The last important factor shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the illicit drug industry is the character of the
legitimate drug system that operates alongside it. The
significance of the legitimate drug system is most obvious for
drugs such as methadone, amphetamines and barbiturates, which
have important medical uses, and very large legitimate production
and distribution systems. Even those drugs that do not have
legitimate medical uses often have some contact with a legitimate
market system. Some illicit heroin, for example, comes from
legitimate opium crops grown to produce morphine. Hallucinogens
and methamphetamine are often manufactured from chemical
precursors that have significant legitimate uses. And even
marijuana has a legitimate sector composed of researchers who are
experimenting with its pharmacological characteristics and
potential medical applications for the control of glaucoma and
depression. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector in which raw materials,
precursors, or finished goods are produced, stored, distributed
and consumed has a potentially significant impact on the
character of the illicit industry. The reason is that diversion
from the legitimate market becomes an alternative to wholly
illicit production and distribution as a source of supply to
illicit markets. Exactly what influence will be exerted depends
on the size of the legitimate market, the strength of the
regulatory regime that surrounds it, and whether the legitimate
system includes the production and distribution of finished goods
or stops some place short of this goal. </p>

<p>For drugs which have a large, loosely regulated legitimate
supply system that includes the distribution of finished goods,
diversion from legitimate sources is likely to become the
dominant source of supply to illicit users. For drugs that have
only a small legitimate sector that is limited to raw materials
or precursors, the illicit supply will be dominated by wholly
illicit production and distribution. Thus, the illicit demand for
tranquilizers is likely to be supplied principally by diversion.
The illicit demand for hallucinogens and marijuana will be
principally supplied by wholly illicit production and
distribution. Also, the illicit demand for amphetamines and
opiate analgesics, such as heroin, morphine and methadone, will
be supplied partly by diverted legitimate drugs, and partly by
wholly illicit production and distribution. </p>

<p>The existence of a legitimate sector from which drugs may be
diverted to illegal use will generally improve the performance of
the illicit market in that drugs will be cheaper and more readily
available than they would be if no legitimate sector existed.
This is true simply because some portion of the activities
necessary to produce and distribute the drug will not be hampered
by the difficulties created by illicitness. Raw materials can be
acquired, transformed into finished products, stored, and
distributed with fewer worries about theft and betrayal by
associates, or disruption by enforcement officials. True,
operating costs will be increased by the requirements of the
regulatory regime. And true, also, someone must absorb the costs
and risks of diverting the drugs to illicit markets. But in all
likelihood, these costs will be much smaller than the costs
imposed on the firms, if they had to assume all of the burden of
protecting their property and enforcing contracts as they have to
in wholly illicit industry. To the extent that only a portion of
the supply system must pay these costs, operating costs and
therefore prices should be lower in illicit markets. </p>

<p>The existence of the legitimate industry should also make the
illicit markets much more flexible. If an illicit amphetamine
laboratory finds that it cannot obtain precursors from the
legitimate market, it can always go into the business of stealing
them from the legitimate sector. Once it has the capacity to
steal precursors, the illicit firm might find it easier to steal
finished products. In short, the existence of the legitimate
market allows illicit dealers the options of relying on theft or
fraud with or without the collusion of people within the
legitimate industry to meet market demands - options that would
not be available if there were no legitimate market. </p>

<p>The impact of the legitimate market on the structure of the
illicit industry is also quite important. The crucial variables
are the places where leaks occur in the process of production and
distribution and the size and regularity of leaked quantities. </p>

<p>Obviously, if only raw materials and precursors leak from the
legitimate system, the illicit system will have to develop
illicit production capabilities to transform the raw materials
into finished goods. This will exert a slight centralizing trend,
for the knowledge and the equipment necessary to produce the
drugs constitute a form of capital that must be amortized and
that means those who possess these will stay in business long
enough and produce enough drugs to achieve this goal. The
break-even point may not require a very large or very durable
firm. The point is that the diversion of raw materials will be
associated with larger more durable firms than the diversion of
finished goods. </p>

<p>When finished goods are stolen, the firm may have no capital
to amortize, and may stay in business only long enough to dispose
of an existing quantity. Of course, a large theft, such as a
truck hijacking, can make a firm look like a major trafficker. If
the firm arranges to continue hijacking drug shipments, it may
become a major drug dealer with an unusual source of supply. In
the more likely case, however, a large theft of legitimate drugs
will produce a large, but transient firm. It will go out of
business shortly. </p>

<p>The other possibilities are that small quantities of finished
goods are diverted either continuously or irregularly from the
legitimate supply system. This form of diversion will produce
small firms that are either durable or transient depending on how
frequently they go back to the well. </p>

<p>Thus, the supply of drugs that have legitimate uses to illicit
markets will be decisively influenced by the size and character
of the leaks from the legitimate system. The earlier in the
process of production and distribution the leaks occur, the
larger and more continuous they are, the more the illicit supply
system will be composed of large durable firms. The later in the
process of distribution, and the smaller and more erratic the
leaks, the more the industry will be atomized. Thus, one might
expect the illicit market in tranquilizers and methadone to be
composed primarily of small, transient firms fueled by small
scale thefts. The illicit markets in amphetamines and
hallucinogens are likely to somewhat more concentrated with more
of the illicit supply in the hands of larger, more of the illicit
supply in the hands of larger, more durable firms. </p>

<p>Different Drugs, Different Industries </p>

<p>So far, our analysis of the illicit drug industry has
abstracted from the particular features of the principal drugs of
abuse in the United States. We have treated heroin, cocaine,
marijuana, hallucinogens, amphetamines, barbiturates and
tranquilizers in a similar analytic framework. But to analyze the
supply systems for these drugs from the same analytic perspective
is not the same as assuming that the supply systems will be
similar. It is only to assume that they will be pushed in similar
directions by the factors we have considered. Exactly how far
they will be pushed in one direction or another strongly depends
on all the factors we have considered, including how zealously
the illegal supply systems are controlled by regulatory and
criminal enforcement. </p>

<p>Heroin </p>

<p>Heroin, for example, seems to be primarily a problem of wholly
illicit production and distribution. The fields in which the
opium poppies are grown are generally illicit fields in countries
that cannot adequately enforce existing laws prohibiting the
cultivation of opium. Similarly, the processing of the raw opium
into heroin occurs principally in foreign countries - probably to
reduce the bulk of the material to facilitate international
smuggling. Because the volume of heroin is so small, it comes
into the United States through many different devices - in the
carry-on luggage of pilots, hidden in small cans of tomatoes and
olive oil, concealed in secret compartments built into cars, and
so on. In the United States the distribution systems seem
moderately tightly concentrated with significant local
monopolies, but little vertical integration. There is probably
some degree of horizontal integration at the importing stage, and
it is at this stage that the concentration of the distribution
system is probably the greatest. Perhaps the few largest firms in
any given city control more than two-thirds of the total volume
of heroin in the city, with some cities in the U.S. serving as
transshipment points for other cities. This relatively tight and
concentrated structure is the result of the fact that the
enforcement pressures are probably still the heaviest against
heroin dealers. </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>The cocaine supply system seems quite similar to the one for
heroin. It is principally a problem of wholly illicit production
and distribution. The sources of raw materials and finished
products are primarily foreign. The physical volumes to be
handled are small enough to make concealment of the drugs a
relatively trivial matter and to allow smugglers to use a variety
of different methods for bringing the drugs into the country. The
average size of the deals measured in terms of financial
requirements seem to be approximately the same as those that
occur in the heroin market. </p>

<p>The major difference between the heroin and the cocaine supply
systems seems to be that the cocaine system is less concentrated,
and more violent than the heroin market. There seem to be many
more entrepreneurs who enter the cocaine business on a short term
basis. Moreover, none of the groups operating on a more permanent
basis seems to have established predominance in the industry.
Thus, it is not surprising that this market is more violent than
the heroin market, for there are cash, drugs and market position
up for grabs in a way unlike the heroin market. </p>

<p>Marijuana </p>

<p>Marijuana is similar to heroin and cocaine in that it is a
wholly illicit system with predominantly foreign sources of raw
materials. Three principal differences seem to make the marijuana
supply system quite different, however. One crucial difference is
that the bulk of marijuana per dollar of value is so much greater
than that of heroin and cocaine that the smuggling problem is
enormously exacerbated. A hundred thousand dollars of heroin or
cocaine can easily be held in a suitcase, but to carry a hundred
thousand dollars worth of marijuana, one needs a small truck,
boat or plane. Because marijuana is so much more visible than
heroin or cocaine, the primary mode of smuggling is in large
loads landed between ports of entry rather than infiltrated
through ports of entry in the huge volume of cargo and people
that daily cross the U.S. borders. This also implies that many
specialized firms might grow up to cope with the special problems
of smuggling marijuana. </p>

<p>A second difference between heroin and cocaine on the one hand
and marijuana on the other is that the pressures in the illicit
industry seem less. It is not that marijuana dealers do not face
substantial financial risks. Indeed, it seems that quite the
opposite is true. The best current estimates indicate that
marijuana dealers lose from a quarter to a third of their
shipments to enforcement agencies. Instead it seems that the
losses are primarily financial, and primarily inflicted by the
government. Other criminals do not seem to prey on marijuana
traffickers in the same way that they attack heroin and cocaine
dealers. Moreover, even if the government seizes property and
arrests the dealers, the prison terms meted out to marijuana
traffickers seem less severe than for those who traffick in other
drugs. Since the marijuana dealers face smaller and less drastic
threats from both the government and other criminals, the
marijuana market seems less preoccupied by the problems of
secrecy, discipline and security than the heroin and cocaine
markets. The net result of this is an industry that is probably
less concentrated then either the heroin and cocaine market, and
almost certainly less violent. </p>

<p>The third important difference shaping the marijuana industry
is the existence of small scale domestic production and
distribution as well as foreign. Indeed, the potential for small
scale domestic cultivation of marijuana makes the marijuana
market more like the market for barbiturates and tranquilizers
than for heroin, because some portion of the overall illicit
demand will be met by those who grow their own. It is this fact
that guarantees the overall industry cannot become very
concentrated, just as it is the widespread availability of
barbiturates and tranquilizers through small scale diversion from
legitimate sources that prevents a concentrated illicit industry
in these drugs from developing. </p>

<p>Hallucinogens, Barbiturates and Amphetamines </p>

<p>The supply system for hallucinogens seems to be primarily
domestic illicit production, although it is possible that some
drugs come from Mexico or Canada. There is a degree of
concentration in this industry as a result of specialized
knowledge, and the creation of brand names to which consumers
become loyal. It seems to operate with relatively little reliance
on either violence or bribery, probably because the industry is
sufficiently small to not be worth the time of enforcement
officials or other criminals. </p>

<p>The industry that supplies barbiturates to illicit markets
seems to depend primarily on diversion from the legitimate
market. Thus, its structure mirrors the character of the leaks
from the legitimate system. This seems to produce a highly
atomistic market composed of small or transient firms. Again,
there is little reliance on either violence or corruption because
the economic stakes seem too small to warrant such risky conduct.
</p>

<p>The amphetamine industry seems to be a combination of the
supply system for hallucinogens and barbiturates. There seems to
be small scale illicit production and distribution that is
primarily domestic, but also from our near neighbors. There is
also diversion from the large legitimate supply system. The net
result is an industry that is high in performing, relative
atomistic in structure, and relies little on either violence or
corruption. </p>

<p>Designing a Strategy to Attack the Illegal Drug Industry </p>

<p>From the perspective of drug abuse policy the primary
objective of a strategy to attack the illegal drug industry is to
increase the effective prices of drugs in illicit markets. Given
our analysis of the factors shaping the structure, conduct and
performance of the industry, it is reasonable to suppose that
making the production and distribution of drugs illegal will tend
to make drugs more expensive and less available than they would
be if they were legal. The important policy question is how the
resources of the government - its diplomatic initiatives, its
interdiction efforts, and its criminal investigations - might be
deployed to maximize the impact of supply reduction efforts on
the effective prices of illicit drugs. </p>

<p>Priorities in Attacking the Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>One way to establish priorities is to determine which
particular drugs seem to be causing the greatest social problems,
and which present opportunities that would give supply reduction
efforts relatively powerful leverage. The worse the drug, and the
more powerful the leverage that can be exerted, the higher the
priority. </p>

<p>Of course, the question of which drugs pose the greatest
threat to the society is much debated. One way to resolve the
issue is to gauge the number of chronic users of each drug, and
to weight that number by the seriousness of the health, economic
and social problems that the chronic users of each drug suffer.
By this reckoning, heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates tend to
come out on top as the worst drugs. </p>

<p>A second standard would be to consider which drugs are most
widely used, and therefore operate as the principal transmitter
of an illicit drug culture and the most common introduction to
drug use for young children. By this standard, marijuana and
tranquilizers would probably come out on top. </p>

<p>A third standard would be to determine which drugs seem to be
associated with the most money, violence and corruption, and
attack that drug as the principal threat to the society. This
last standard would probably make cocaine and heroin the dominant
targets of drug policy. </p>

<p>In thinking about which of these standards night be
appropriate to use in deciding which drugs caused the greatest
social problems, it is worth trying to keep the separate
objectives of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy in
mind. The principal objective of drug use abuse policy is to
minimize the social problems associated with drug use. A key
instrument of that policy are criminal laws controlling the
supply of drugs. These policies succeed when there are few people
using drugs in patterns that create grave threats to their health
and economic welfare. In effect, we use criminal laws and
criminal enforcement to achieve a social welfare objective. </p>

<p>The principal objectives of organized crime policy are to
suppress the provision of illegal goods and services that
constitute the core of organized crime, to prevent the violence
and corruption that is more characteristic of organized crime
groups than other kinds of criminal activity, and to prevent the
emergence of very large, durable organizations with well
developed capacities for violence and corruption. </p>

<p>There is a substantial overlap in the goals of organized crime
policy and supply reduction efforts insofar as organized crime
policy takes the control of the supply of drugs as an important
objective, and insofar as the illicit supply systems included
violence, corruption and large firms. But to the extent that the
core of organized crime policy is really concerned with the
disruption of major criminal organizations, there is an overlap
between the core of drug abuse policy and organized crime policy
only insofar as the drugs are supplied by rich, violent and
powerful criminal organizations. As we have seen, that is true of
only a certain number of drugs, and not necessarily the drugs
that pose the greatest threats in terms of widespread and
dangerous consumption. </p>

<p>In fact, the third standard described above is closer to a
description of the core objectives of organized crime policy than
to the core objectives of drug abuse policy. In essence, the
society has to decide whether it means to go after the drugs that
cause it the most problem in illicit use, or whether it should
attack the drugs that are supplied by the nastiest and toughest
dealers. These are not necessarily the same. </p>

<p>The Instruments of a Strategy Against Illicit Drug Industries </p>

<p>Once the society has implicitly or explicitly established its
objectives, it must then look to the available instruments of a
supply reduction strategy. Again, there are many different ways
one can think about the available instruments. </p>

<p>Attacking Different Drugs. One way is to think about them in
terms of the particular drugs they attack. Thus, one can
distinguish the instruments of heroin policy (which include the
effective control of legitimate opium in Turkey, the suppression
of illicit crops in Mexico and Afghanistan, the encouragement of
crop substitution in Thailand, the creation of specialized heroin
detecting devices at U.S. ports of entry, and the targeting of
heroin importing and distributing organizations, and even the
occasional attacks on street level dealing in notorious areas of
a city) from the instruments of a marijuana control policy (which
includes diplomatic initiatives and foreign aid to Mexico and
Jamaica, the eradication of illicit fields, the training of
marijuana sniffing dogs to stand guard at the border, the
mobilization of the Navy and Coast Guard to aid in the
identification of ships engaged in large scale smuggling, and so
on). The point is that many policy initiatives are specific to,
or have their maximum impact on, one drug rather than another,
and it is a useful exercise to see how our efforts are deployed
against particular drugs. </p>

<p>Operating in Different Locations. A second dimension in which
strategies against the illegal drug industry can be described and
evaluated is geography. One can talk about the division between
the international drug control effort and the domestic
activities. Among the international efforts, one can talk about
policy towards Southeast Asia (which would be principally
directed at heroin), or towards Colombia (which would be
principally directed against cocaine), or towards Mexico (which
would embrace heroin, marijuana and amphetamines). Within the
domain of domestic supply reduction efforts, one can discuss the
allocation of enforcement efforts across major cities in the
United States, and this, too, has implications for the different
drugs attacked. Enforcement efforts in New York and Los Angeles
will probably give more emphasis to heroin and cocaine than
efforts in Kansas City or St. Louis. </p>

<p>Targeting Factors of Production. A third dimension in
characterizing and analyzing supply reduction policy instruments
is the factor of production and distribution that is the
principal target. Thus, one can distinguish eradication and crop
substitution programs, which are directed at raw materials; from
financial investigations, which attack the capital of illicit
dealers; from interdiction programs which attack goods in
transit, from conspiracy investigations, which are designed to
immobilize trafficking network; from street level enforcement
which is designed to discourage advertising and the development
of new markets. Of course, many instruments allow one to reach
other targets as well as its principal target. Indeed, conspiracy
investigations are often built from the discoveries made in
interdiction and street enforcement programs. The point is that
these different policy instruments have different factors of
production as their proximate targets. To the extent that some
factors of production and distribution are scarcer than others,
the relative importance of the different supply reduction
instruments in constricting the supply of drugs may be gauged and
appropriate adjustments made in the supply reduction strategy. </p>

<p>Relying on Different Agencies. A fourth way of thinking about
supply reduction policy instruments, and probably the most
common, is in terms of the agencies that are principally
responsible for carrying out different activities within the
overall supply reduction effort. Thus, one thinks in terms of the
international supply reduction program as the principal
responsibility of the State Department; the interdiction effort
as the primary responsibility of the U.S. Customs, Border Patrol,
and Coast Guard with occasional assistance from the U.S. Armed
Forces; the domestic investigation program as the primary
responsibility of DEA and the FBI; and the street level
enforcement effort as the primary responsibility of the nation's
thousands of local police departments. Thinking about the supply
reduction effort in these terms has the advantage of bringing
immediately to mind which agencies are available for supply
reduction efforts, and of suggesting approximately where they can
make a contribution both geographically and in terms of squeezing
particular factors of production and distribution. It has the
disadvantage, however, of not sharply distinguishing among the
different efforts in terms of either drugs or specific factors of
production and distribution. </p>

<p>The Strengths and Limitations of Alternative Instruments </p>

<p>For purposes of a broad brush strategic analysis, we will use
this last set of categories, since they are the terms in which
most of the policy discussions at the federal level are now being
carried out. Our task will be to determine the potential of each
area in minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit markets in the
U.S. That, in turn, depends on our ability to see how each of
these programs affects the factors of production and distribution
for the major drugs of abuse. </p>

<p>The International Program. The international drug control
program has two principal liabilities as an instrument of supply
reduction efforts. The first is that this program is inevitably
hostage to the interests and capabilities of foreign governments:
the U.S. can do no more in this area than other governments will
allow it to do. Of course, there are numerous ways in which the
U.S. government can increase the motivation and capacities of
foreign governments to control drugs that reach U.S. markets. The
U.S. can indicate the importance it attaches to drug control
among other interests it is pursuing within a given country; or
it can appeal to obligations a country has under international
treaties; or it can appeal to the country's self interest by
documenting the extent of the country's domestic drug problem. On
the capacity side, the U.S. can contribute money, or particular
kinds of equipment, or technical assistance in the forms of
specific on-site advice, or more generalized training of drug
control officials. These specific measures constitute the daily
activities of the international program. In the end, though, they
run up against more or less unmovable barriers, such as the
limited control of central governments over out-lying areas of a
country, or the inefficiency and corruption of government
agencies. Against these obstacles there is often little that the
U.S. government can do. </p>

<p>The second limitation is that the bulk of this program seems
too targeted on the raw materials for heroin, cocaine and
marijuana. Arguably, this is not particularly effective, since
there is not particular reason to believe that the raw materials
for these drugs are in long run short supply. Indeed, all our
experience and intelligence suggests that potential growing areas
for these drugs are widespread, and that the elimination of
fields in one place will fairly soon be replaced by cultivation
elsewhere. </p>

<p>These limitations are sufficiently severe that it would
probably be a mistake to rely on the international program as the
primary instrument in a supply reduction strategy. It simply
cannot do enough work reliably enough to merit that position.
Having said this, however, there are some very important things
the international program can do that will make an important
contribution to the overall effectiveness of supply reduction
efforts. </p>

<p>The first is that it will occasionally occur that the standard
efforts of the international program suddenly become effective.
This usually occurs when a country important in supplying drugs
to the United States suddenly becomes highly motivated to control
drugs. When this happens, support from the United States can
often result in a significant shortage of the drug. Typically,
the shortage lasts no longer than a year or two as the illicit
industry adjusts to the new conditions. But even so, that
shortage is worth producing. That is particularly true for drugs
that are unusually dependence producing, for the shortage means
that a cohort of children in the ages of maximum vulnerability
squirts through that period of relative shortages with much lower
probabilities of dependence or addiction. </p>

<p>Indeed, this is what happened in the early part of the 1970's,
when Turkey suddenly shut down its legitimate production of opium
and helped to produce a two to three year shortage in the supply
of heroin. The effect of this success was high effective prices
in the United States, reduced incidence of heroin use, and a
shift to Mexico and Southeast Asia as the principal sources of
supply, although for a while at lesser volumes than had been true
when Turkey was also a supplier. </p>

<p>Keeping open such opportunities, and being in a position to
exploit them when they come along, are the principal
contributions of the international drug program. Hut one cannot
always count on such successes. It is important, then, that the
international program continue, trying to increase the likelihood
that it can occasionally produce such successes, but no one
should rely on it as the principal supply reduction instrument. </p>

<p>A second way that the international program can be helpful is
by stepping up its efforts to support international criminal
enforcement. In essence, the focus of the international program
might usefully shift from crop eradication, to efforts to deny
international traffickers &quot;safe havens&quot; anywhere in the
world. This would mean concretely increased progress in
negotiating extradition treaties with countries that now harbor
traffickers, and improving operational coordination between
foreign and U.S. police agencies to take advantage of both
extradition and investigations and prosecutions within the host
country. </p>

<p>Such a thrust has potential for two reasons. First, it is a
narrowly focused program. It has none of the logistical and
bureaucratic difficulties of massive crop control programs.
Second, it is targeted against a factor of production and
distribution that is probably in long run short supply, namely
individuals with a sufficiently well established reputation for
both reliability in successful transactions and viciousness in
betrayals, who become the primary people with whom large drug
deals can be made. If this is the factor in long run short supply
in the illicit industry; and if the international program could
squeeze this factor even more by denying notorious dealers safe
havens anywhere in the world; then the international program
would have another more reliable and more powerful way of making
a contribution than cultivating the motivations and capacities of
foreign governments to control illicit crops. </p>

<p>Interdiction. In recent years, the interdiction program has
probably been the fastest growing component of the supply
reduction effort. The growth has come primarily as a result of
engaging the U.S. Coast Guard and other military agencies in the
pursuit of smugglers on the ocean and in the air. The results of
this effort can be seen in the dramatic difference in the price
of drugs landed in the U.S. as compared with the price of drugs
off-shore, or in foreign source countries. </p>

<p>The principal problem with interdiction as the dominant
instruction of supply reduction efforts is that it is principally
focused on a single drug - marijuana. That is particularly true
insofar as it concentrates on bulk shipments clandestinely landed
between ports of entry, for marijuana is the only drug whose
volume restricts smugglers to these methods of getting the drugs
across the borders. Smugglers of heroin and cocaine have many
more options, and much more of these drugs seem to come across in
relatively small containers through ports of entry. Thus, the
engagement of the Coast Guard, the Navy, the Air Force, and the
Federal Aviation Administration, turns out to be an initiative
that is primarily targeted against marijuana. To the extent that
one thinks marijuana is currently a high priority drug to
control, this may be counted a benefit rather than a problem. But
to the extent that one thinks other drugs are higher priority, or
to the extent one wanted flexible supply reduction instruments
that could be used for controlling several different drugs, the
current interdiction program has important limitations. </p>

<p>The interdiction program has a further limitation. It is
principally targeted on finished inventories of drugs. There is a
certain, concrete satisfaction in capturing drugs that would
otherwise reach illicit markets. But as in the case of crop
elimination, one can wonder whether the inventories are what is
in long run short supply. When we think about legitimate firms,
we don't think of their inventories of finished goods as being
particularly important. Obviously, the inventories have value,
and to the extent they are eliminated, the firm had less capital
than it otherwise would. But the inventories usually reflect only
a small portion of the total value of the firm. When Tylenol had
to be taken off the market, for example, no one expected the
company to go out of business, even though a month's worth of
production had to be written off, and their reputation had been
seriously tarnished. </p>

<p>Similarly, it is hard to understand why we think it is so
important when drugs are seized. This may be important if the
firm was a short term operation, and the seized shipment
represented a large fraction of its total assets, but there is no
particular reason to believe this. Most of the time it seems that
shipments are divided up precisely to hedge against the
possibility that he drugs will be seized, and this seems to be a
likely event. Current estimates indicate that somewhere between
one-quarter and one-third of all marijuana shipments are seized,
but this has had little impact on the effective price of
marijuana. Thus, our experience and our reasoning suggest that
finished goods are not a factor of production and distribution
that is in long run short supply. Consequently, a policy
instrument directed primarily against such inventories will not
exert enormous leverage on the long run effective price of drugs
in illicit markets. </p>

<p>Domestic Enforcement. The standard criticism of the domestic
enforcement program is that it is &quot;too far from the
source&quot; of drugs to allow effective control. By this
reckoning both the international and the interdiction programs
are preferred instruments because they attack the chain of
production and distribution at an earlier stage than domestic
enforcement. A second criticism is that the quantity of drugs
seized in the domestic enforcement program is too low to allow it
to have much effective control. A third criticism is that too
much of the effort within the domestic enforcement program goes
into low level cases, which are farthest from the source and
involve the smallest quantities of drugs. </p>

<p>The difficulty with these criticisms is that they rely on
assumptions - with little evidence or reasoning behind them -
about the best way to control the supply of drugs. In fact, they
emphasize physical over economic relationships. A priori there is
no particular reason to assume that resources are better spent
&quot;nearer the source.&quot; True, if one stops the drugs
earlier rather than later on need not worry about the later
stages; and, true, the drugs may be at their maximum
concentration with respect to volume at the point they are
processed into finished products. But neither point indicates
that he source is the most important point to attack. As we have
seen, it may be quite difficult to mount an attack at that point.
Moreover, both arguments place too much emphasis on the drugs and
not enough on the entrepreneurs and firms whose continued
determination and adaptability keep the drugs flowing, even if
production runs are spoiled and inventories seized. </p>

<p>If the principal difficulties that confront dealers in
producing and distributing drugs are risks posed by enforcement
agents and other criminals, then the crucial factors of
production and distribution are not raw materials and technology
and warehouses, but the determination and capacity to complete
transactions in this risky environment. Those may be qualities
possessed by specific individuals or trafficking networks - not
the raw materials, not the finished inventories, not even the
financial capital. If these observations are accurate, then any
instrument that attacked the capacities to complete risky trans
actions would be more effective than those that attacked raw
materials or inventories. </p>

<p>It is here that domestic enforcement operations have
advantages as an instrument in a supply reduction strategy. The
principal objective of domestic enforcement is the traffickers
themselves. The drugs are important only as convincing evidence
that will be sufficient to jail, and therefore presumably
immobilize, the traffickers. In addition, the tactics of domestic
enforcement operate principally on the capacity to execute
transactions. The principal tactics include informants,
undercover agents, and wiretap investigations. The first two
attack the ability to make transactions by forcing dealers to be
wary of associates, employees and customers, since any of these
might become an informant or an undercover agent. The third makes
it difficult for traffickers to communicate efficiently with
associates, employees and customers. Therefore domestic
enforcement presses hard on the factors of production and
distribution that seem in long run short supply. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that slowing transactions and forcing
dealers to be cautious has value at many different stages of
production and distribution. Even at the lowest levels of
distribution there are some advantages in forcing dealers to be
cautious, for it prevents the aggressive recruitment of new
customers and makes it more difficult even for regular consumers
to find drugs. In short, street level enforcement increases the
effective price of drugs in illicit markets. At intermediate or
high levels each transaction that is slowed reduces the overall
capacity of the system to supply drugs, and each trafficking
network that is eliminated results not only in loss of current
inventories, but also in future capacity to supply. </p>

<p>Moreover, it is possible that the same techniques of attacking
transactions, and immobilizing those networks that have developed
a continuing capacity to execute transactions in a risky
environment, would have enormous value in the international
program as well as in the domestic one. Indeed, while one cannot
assume that foreign countries have laws enforcement agencies that
allow them to attack criminal trafficking organizations, it seems
that it is primarily convention that makes us think of the
international program as focused on raw materials, and the
domestic program as focused on trafficking networks. In
principle, one could have a criminal enforcement program that
moved across national boundaries. And that might hold the best
chance not only for minimizing the supply of drugs to illicit
markets, but also for advancing the subjectives and using the
resources of organized crime policy. </p>

<p>An Alternative Approach to Attacking Illegal Drug Industries </p>

<p>If the right way to think about strategies against the illegal
drug industry is to guess which factor of production and
distribution is in long run short supply and then to devise a
strategy that presses hardest on that factor, and if the factor
in long run short supply is the capacity to make transactions
quickly and effectively, then a different way is opened to think
about the strategy against the illegal drug industry.
Specifically, the principal aim should be to frustrate
transactions and immobilize the largest trafficking
organizations. </p>

<p>With this as the principal aim the way that we think about
each of the other instruments changes. Of course, the
international efforts to control legitimate crops and eradicate
illicit fields retain their special, occasional importance, and
the separate arguments for maintaining pressure at the street
level remain strong. But we can also see that the international
program, interdiction, and domestic enforcement all represent
different opportunities to slice into the illicit industry, and
create possibilities for developing cases against illicit
traffickers. To see how this alternative strategy would work, it
is useful to introduce some different analytic terms. </p>

<p>Patrol versus Investigation. If the goal is to immobilize
trafficking organizations that are able to complete transactions
with ease and efficiency, the central problem is to determine who
the traffickers are and to develop evidence against them. This
sounds like a problem of criminal investigation, and so it is.
But all investigations must begin somewhere. In ordinary criminal
investigations the start is usually provided by a victim or
witness to the offense or by physical evidence available at the
site of the crime. In narcotics investigations there is no
victim, the witnesses are likely to be implicated in the crime,
and the physical evidence will not reveal much. On the other
hand, the traffickers are likely to continue committing offenses,
and therefore the opportunity to observe a crime occurring is
high, if the enforcement agencies can get themselves into
position to see it. </p>

<p>In practice this means that narcotics investigations are
extremely dependent on informants and undercover operators, who
can provide evidence themselves or produce sufficiently precise
and accurate information to justify a wire-tap or other less
intrusive but more expensive and less penetrating form of
surveillance. They can position the evidence-gathering
capabilities of enforcement agencies and how to infiltrate
undercover agents into the illicit industry. The question thus
becomes how to develop and use informants and how to use
informants and how to infiltrate undercover agents into the
illicit firms. </p>

<p>One answer to that question is to attack the illicit supply
systems in the places where it is least protected. This means on
the streets in central cities where the distribution system must
finally come into the open. Or, it means at the point that is
inherently vulnerable, where drugs are moved physically from one
place to another. Or, it means as raw materials are being
collected from remote fields in foreign countries. Surveillance
and undercover operations conducted in these areas will not only
frustrate transactions at these levels, and remove small stocks
of drugs, but they will also produce the rumors, the physical
evidence, and the potential informants who might provide the
basis for more intrusive and determined investigations of larger
networks. </p>

<p>This will not always work, of course. Many people arrested at
this level will be small scale, transient operators. Others will
be employees, but they may be unable to supply information. Still
others may know a great deal but be afraid to reveal it.
Moreover, there are other ways of developing informants. One can
offer large payments to those who are greedy, or protection to
those who are afraid, or both to potentially valuable sources.
And, just as low level enforcement operations against street
dealers, smugglers, and collectors in foreign countries can
produce potential informants,, all successful investigations
against medium and high level investigations can also yield
informants. Therefore, successful cases can be built from many
sources other than low level cases. </p>

<p>But the argument is that a high volume enforcement effort at
low levels is often quite valuable as a source of rumors,
intelligence and informants. In fact, there is an argument
supporting low level enforcement. Even more unexpectedly, there
is an argument for a low level enforcement that is not directed
or guided by intelligence about the operations of major
traffickers. </p>

<p>The strength of investigative efforts is their capacity to
make connections among known facts and inform enforcement
agencies how to position themselves to penetrate existing
trafficking organizations and develop evidence for a successful
prosecution. The weakness of investigation is that it becomes
increasingly narrow and discounts information that cannot be
related to something that is already known. In attacking
something as mysterious and dynamic as the illicit drug industry,
this tendency to become narrow is potentially very dangerous.
There is always the chance that one is concentrating on only a
small piece of the overall industry and that there is a newer or
better shielded piece that has so far escaped notice. If this is
true, the only way that enforcement agencies could discover this
is to look in areas where they didn't expect to find something.
That is the role of broad, untargeted low level enforcement
agencies. Like pickets and patrols sent out by a main military
force to maintain contact with a mysterious enemy force, agents
on the street, at the border, and in the bazaars of foreign
countries help the investigative forces stay in touch with the
emergence and development of new trafficking capabilities. </p>

<p>For analytic purposes it is useful to think of these broad,
low level enforcement operations as &quot;patrol&quot;
operations, which are scanning for drug offenses, and the
remaining pieces as &quot;investigative&quot; operations, which
can develop the leads into powerful cases that immobilize major
trafficking organizations. Moreover, in many ways, the patrol
operations perform better, if they are broad and random, rather
than narrowly targeted. A random strategy is more successful in
deterrence, and in disclosing previously unsuspected trafficking
networks. </p>

<p>The Role of Intelligence and Conspiracy Investigations. To
take full advantage of the potential relationship between
investigative and patrol functions and to produce the maximum
impact on trafficking organizations, it is necessary that some
previously neglected capabilities be more fully developed. Two
are particularly important: the intelligence function within the
investigative agencies, and the capacity to develop and prosecute
conspiracy cases within investigative and prosecutorial offices. </p>

<p>By the intelligence function, I mean the capacity to make
disciplined use of the information about trafficking networks
that is potentially available to the investigative agencies. This
is essential not only to take full advantage of any opportunities
that present themselves, but also to make sure the investigative
agencies are not misled by informants. As we have seen, there is
always an incentive for traffickers to inform on their
competitors. And there is always an incentive for enforcement
agencies to use the information and keep the informant alive.
This is acceptable as long as the informant is not more important
than the traffickers he is delivering to the enforcement
agencies. But if the informant is himself a dealer, then the
result of his informing looks like he and the enforcement agency
are colluding to maintain his position in the market. The only
way to guard against this is to have relatively accurate
information about both the informant and the target and to have
someone other than the case agent monitoring this situation. That
is something that a good intelligence analysis function could
provide. </p>

<p>The capacity to make conspiracy cases is essential because
there are many traffickers who can be revealed only through
conspiracy indictments. They may never be in direct contact with
drugs, or with the violence and corruption that provide the
structure within which the drugs can be confidently moved from
place to place and from person to person. In addition, conspiracy
cases have the advantage of simultaneously immobilizing many
pieces of a trafficking network, leaving no remnants from which a
new network might be constructed. If a single person is removed,
he may be replaced. If the entire network is eliminated,
replacement is more difficult because none of the personal
relationships that are so essential to successful trafficking
remain. </p>

<p>The challenges to investigators in making conspiracy cases are
partly matters of technique. Electronic surveillance is often an
essential ingredient, as are financial investigations. And each
require the development of special skills. Hut producing high
quality conspiracy investigations also requires a change in
attitude. They require patience - including situations where
enforcement agencies allow some dealers to continue operating
even though they are indictable. They also require risking
certain cases that are certain, for a future case that may or may
not develop. Finally, the prosecution of conspiracy cases often
depends on telling convincing stories rather than hard physical
evidence. Even though the stories night be a more accurate
account of what has been happening than the hard physical
evidence, it requires a real knack for analysis and inference to
make the story solid and convincing. In short, patience, a
willingness to take risks for an uncertain gain, and thought are
required, and these are not always qualities plentiful in
action-oriented enforcement agencies. Yet, without these, the
aggressive actions might have less impact than they otherwise
could. </p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>Criminal statutes directed at illicit drug trafficking and use
are an important part of drug abuse policy. If they were
perfectly effective in discouraging people from drug trafficking
and drug abuse, there would be little need for any other
instruments. </p>

<p>The problem is that these laws are imperfectly effective: they
leave a residual market that consists of a continuing (but
smaller) demand for drugs, and a continuing (but smaller)
capacity to supply drugs to that market. To deal with the
continuing demand, the society relies on drug treatment and
preventive education programs. To deal with the continuing
supply, the country invests in diplomatic efforts to motivate
foreign countries to control drugs destined for the U.S.,
interdiction efforts to keep the drugs from landing on our
shores, domestic enforcement to disrupt trafficking networks and
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs to non-users,
regulatory efforts to keep legitimate drugs contained in
legitimate channels of distribution and use. </p>

<p>These efforts on the supply side of the illegal drug market
are helpful in achieving the purposes of drug policy. They
increase the price and reduce the availability of drugs, and
therefore discourage new drug use and motivate older users to
abandon their drug use. But the laws create a problem for
organized crime policy, for they establish the soil from which an
illegal industry can grow. The firms that continue in the
industry will make a great deal of money as compensation for the
risks they run by continuing in the business. In addition, they
will engage in violence and corruption as crucial elements of
their strategies for surviving in an illicit industry. Finally,
some of the individuals and organizations involved in drug
trafficking may grow to become powerful criminal institutions
that seem to defy effective control by law enforcement agencies.
To the extent that these illicit firms become more adept at
dealing drugs, they may become not only an organized crime
problem, but an increased threat to the objectives of drug abuse
policy. Thus, the special instruments we associate with organized
crime policy must be deployed not only to deal with the organized
crime problem that is created by our drug abuse policy, but also
to prevent organized criminal groups from defeating the purposes
of drug abuse policy. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of drug abuse policy, the central
objective of a strategy attacking the illegal drug industry is to
minimize the capacity of the illicit drug industry to supply
drugs to illicit markets. In terms of traditional analyses of
industrial organization, this objective can be described as
minimizing the &quot;performance&quot; of the illicit industry. </p>

<p>Viewed from the perspective of organized crime policy, the
central objectives are to prevent the development of wealthy and
powerful criminal groups and to reduce the violence and
corruption associated with the illicit drug industry. Again, in
the traditional analyses of industrial organization, these
objectives can be captured by attacking the structure and shaping
the conduct of the industry. </p>

<p>There may be some tension between the objectives of drug abuse
policy on the one hand, and organized crime on the policy on the
other. To the extent that the drug laws create the conditions
under which an illicit industry might arise, there is an obvious
conflict. Legalization of the drugs would almost certainly
increase the number of chronic, intensive drug users and
therefore make the drug problem worse. But it would also
eliminate drugs as an organized crime problem. Beyond this
observation is another paradox, however. From the perspective of
drug abuse policy, a highly concentrated industry may be
preferable to an atomized industry. A concentrated industry might
supply fewer drugs at higher prices than an atomized industry.
And, although each firm in the industry may be harder to attack
effectively, the impact of a successful attack might be larger
and more enduring than the results of ten successful attacks on
smaller firms that accounted for a smaller portion of the total
supply capacity and were easier to replace. From the perspective
of organized crime policy, however, a concentrated industry would
be worse because it would imply the existence of large, enduring
organizations of substantial power and influence. What is not in
conflict, however, is the need of both drug abuse policy and
organized crime policy to develop and use tactics that are
successful in attacking large, entrenched criminal organizations.
This is useful to drug policy and essential to organized crime
policy. </p>

<p>In controlling the supply of drugs to illicit markets the
United States relies on many instruments, in addition to
attacks&quot; on organized criminal groups that deal in drugs.
There is an &quot;international program&quot; that tends to focus
on the production of raw materials to produce heroin and cocaine.
This has the advantage of occasionally producing a significant
but short-lived result when a foreign country's increased
motivation and capacity to deal with the problem eliminates an
important source of supply to the U.S. But the value of the
instrument overall is limited by the widespread availability of
raw materials and the fact that U.S. objectives are always
hostage to the motivations and capacities of foreign governments.
</p>

<p>There is also an &quot;interdiction program&quot; designed to
intercept the drugs and shipment before they cross U.S. borders.
This has the advantage of creating a significant obstacle to
traffickers and inflicting economic losses on traffickers as a
result of seizures. It has the disadvantages of focusing
principally on the inventories of drugs rather than on the
organizations that continue to send them, and of being relatively
less successful in dealing with heroin and cocaine than with
marijuana. </p>

<p>Finally there is a &quot;domestic enforcement program&quot;,
designed to attack domestic trafficking organizations, and to
discourage the aggressive marketing of drugs through street level
enforcement. This program has the advantages of focusing on the
trafficking organizations and engaging the substantial resources
of the nation's 400,000 local police officers. It has the
disadvantages to being only occasionally successful in
eliminating major trafficking organizations. </p>

<p>What appears to be missing in this common conception of the
nation's strategy against the supply of drugs to illicit markets
is precisely the perspective that a focus on international
criminal organizations would bring. It seems likely that the
capacity to execute large scale transactions in the risky
environment of an illicit industry is in long run, short supply
in the illicit drug industry. The firms that can overcome these
difficulties are likely to be large scale, enduring,
organizations with a well established reputation for irresistible
violence. Thus, these firms - in all likelihood, international
firms - should become the main targets of a supply reduction/
organized crime policy. </p>

<p>If this is the principal target, one's view of how the society
should deploy it resources should change dramatically. The
interdiction and domestic enforcement programs are suddenly seen
principally as &quot;patrol operations&quot;, which can produce
intelligence and informants to be used in mounting attacks on
major trafficking organizations. Moreover, the focus of the
international program should shift from concerns about crop
control to the support of foreign enforcement efforts and the
negotiation of treaties, which would allow the more convenient
prosecution of drug traffickers whose crimes cross national
boundaries. Finally, major investments should be made in the
capabilities of intelligence agencies and an orientation towards
sustained conspiracy cases among investigators and prosecutors.
This strategy holds the greatest potential to achieve the
objectives of both drug abuse policy and organized crime policy.
Moreover, this strategy depends most heavily on the continuing
development of our capacity to deal with organized criminal
groups no matter what illegal goods and services they happen to
be supplying.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Winning the War Against Drugs </h2>

<p>By Mitchell S. Rosenthal, M.D. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Rosenthal is President of the Phoenix House Foundation, a drug
rehabilitation program. </p>

<p>There is a popular perception these days that America is
locked in a &quot;no win&quot; struggle against drugs. This
notion of &quot;the endless battle,&quot; in which we seem unable
to prevail, that has prompted a good many lawyers, scientists,
and writers to suggest that it might be time for the United
States to quit. </p>

<p>Some Americans have always believed that the use of certain
illicit drugs is not such a terrible thing and others have argued
that the government has no right to tell citizens what they can
or cannot ingest. But the strongest opposition to the nation's
drug laws and policies has come from those who believe that they
should be scrapped because they do not work well. The latest
converts to this cause contend that legalization of marijuana and
cocaine (some would include heroin) would eliminate drug profits
and crime overnight and substantially reduce the costly burden of
enforcing drug laws. </p>

<p>The &quot;quit now&quot; crowd plainly does not recognize that
there is a world of difference between &quot;not winning&quot; a
war and &quot;losing&quot; one. The war against drugs, although
it is going badly at the moment, is far from lost. But quitting
now and attempting to solve the drug crime problem through
legalization would he tantamount to losing - at least in terms of
the impact on drug abuse. </p>

<p>The notion that we could make drugs legal, while
simultaneously mounting (as some advocates of legalization
suggest) a massive public education campaign to discourage their
use would give cocaine and marijuana the same status as
cigarettes. The most likely result, according to the former
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, would be a
tenfold increase in cocaine use. There would be just about as
many Americans using cocaine as now smoke cigarettes. </p>

<p>Another reason not to give up the fight is because we can win.
After more than 20 years of treating and curing drug abuse, I see
enough evidence to convince me that the war is winnable - not
now, but in time. It is winnable because what denies us victory
today is the nature of the war we are waging and not the nature
of the enemy we are fighting. </p>

<p>The war is going badly for much the same reasons that any war
goes badly. In part, it is inappropriate strategy fighting the
wrong enemy, in the wrong place and with the wrong weapons. In
part, it is a failure of will. </p>

<p>We are on the defensive, with battle lines stretching along
our borders. Our main weapon is interdiction. Most of the billion
dollars a year the Federal government spends enforcing drug laws
(two-thirds of all it spends to fight drug abuse) goes to halt
the flow of illicit drugs into our country. </p>

<p>Yet, the drugs keep flowing, even though 13 tons of cocaine
and 1,500 tons of marijuana (with a total street value of $11
billion) were seized by federal agents last year. It would seem
that when $5 million or $50 million or $500 million worth of
drugs is impounded, the total available for distribution would he
reduced by a like amount. Hut that is not the case. Drugs lost
through seizure are instantly replaced by producers and
importers. The more Federal agents seize at our end of the
pipeline, the more drug traffickers feed into the other end.
Although interdiction efforts have expanded dramatically and vast
quantities of drugs have been seized, the flow to the street has
diminished hardly at all, and cost to consumers has actually
fallen. </p>

<p>In frustration, Americans have turned their ire on producing
nations. Apparently, we feel more comfortable and justified
pressuring Colombians, Peruvians and Bolivians to stop producing
cocaine than pressuring Americans to stop using it. </p>

<p>In spite of minimal success, we remain committed to battling
drugs primarily by reducing supply rather than by reducing
demand. Yet, the supply side is obviously harder to hit and to
hurt. Producers are beyond our reach. Major dealers are
sophisticated, secretive, and ruthless, willing to accept
enormous risks and enormous losses as long as profits remain
equally enormous. </p>

<p>The demand side, however, is easier to reach. It is vast,
barely concealed at all these days, and it consists of the more
than 20 million Americans who now regularly use illicit drugs.
What's more, the demand side is where all three weapons at our
disposal can be deployed - not only law enforcement, but drug
treatment and drug prevention as well. </p>

<p>Our reluctance to attack demand as vigorously as we attack
supply reflects nothing less than a failure of will - not on the
part of the administration, law enforcement agencies or drug
abuse professionals, but on the part of the American public.
Public attitudes and public expectations determine how we go
about fighting this war, limit how much we can do and how far we
dare go. </p>

<p>What limits drug treatment is not just reduced government
support. Even if resources were available, there is no way we
could help the great majority of drug abusers in this country to
overcome their drug dependency because most of them are not
seeking help. They are not seeking help because society does not
require them, and the law does not compel them. </p>

<p>Limits on what drug prevention can accomplish reflect what can
only be called a public demand for selective prevention the
prevention of some but not necessarily all drug use. Just about
everyone wants to prevent one kind of drug use or another. Most
parents believe that kids shouldn't use drugs. Most employers are
convinced that workers ought not use them. The public in general
would like to see criminals stop using drugs and stop stealing in
order to buy drugs. But, beyond this point, public demand softens
considerably and attitudes become ambivalent. </p>

<p>Nowhere is our ambivalence more evident than in our attitudes
towards law enforcement. We are content with a &quot;trickle
down&quot; approach - one that focuses almost exclusively on
putting major dealers behind bars. But we learned during the days
of strict enforcement in New York State during the 1960's and
from recent crackdowns on street dealers in New York City, that
the real victories of law enforcement are not the number of
dealers or users arrested or convicted but the number motivated
to seek treatment. We know that when it becomes too dangerous or
too difficult to sell drugs or to buy them, then a great deal of
drug use will simply disappear and demand for treatment will rise
rapidly to the level of real need. </p>

<p>Lenient or selective enforcement of drug laws - what amounts
to non-enforcement and de facto legalization - in some areas - is
a reflection of our ambivalence. It comes down to the way that
Americans feel personally about drugs - not only about our own
use, but about use by our grown and half-grown children and by
our friends, and about what is wrongheadedly called
&quot;recreational&quot; use of marijuana and cocaine. While it
may make us uncomfortable, most of us do not think of it in the
same way as we think about drug use by nine- and ten-year-olds or
about the heroin addiction of criminals. And we are generally
unwilling to see our friends and children at risk of arrest and
prosecution because of drug use. </p>

<p>But I do not believe we can win the war against drugs until we
have positive consensus on the strict enforcement of drug laws.
However, we need not make that decision any harder than it must
be. We don't have to agree that drug users should go to jail. The
purpose of drug laws is not punishment - certainly not when
applied to users. These laws serve what must be recognized as a
public health function - a means of controlling a contagious
disease by imposing on its carriers the requirement of whatever
it takes in the way of education and treatment to overcome their
drug use. </p>

<p>We are not likely to see this consensus come soon. Too many
drug-using young adults are still convinced they enjoy some
special &quot;right&quot; to use illicit drugs and believe they
can handle them. Too many Americans are torn between the urge to
condemn behavior, of which they disapprove, and the need to
tolerate behavior they have somehow come to believe is a matter
of individual freedom or simply none of their business. </p>

<p>But both drug users and drug tolerators ignore the contagious
nature of drug abuse. The hostess who overlooks a little discreet
after-dinner pot-smoking or the professional who pointedly
ignores covert coke-sniffing by his or her colleagues must
eventually come to realize that a person can no more tolerate a
little recreational drug use than he or she can tolerate a little
recreational smallpox. As for users, even those convinced that
their own drug habits are under control cannot guarantee that the
friends, coworkers or teenagers they influence will be able to
avoid drug dependency and the other high risks of drug use. Nor
is there any basis for them to believe that they will continue to
enjoy immunity from the costs of drug use - if indeed they enjoy
it now. </p>

<p>Broad societal disapproval of illicit drug use is needed
before we can come to a consensus about strict drug law
enforcement. Needless to say, active disapproval and the use of
informal social sanctions will make more aggressive law
enforcement irrelevant in most cases. The hostess who is certain
enough of her own unwillingness to tolerate pot smoking in her
home doesn't need to call the cops to keep her guests from
lighting up - no more than she need call them to stop her guests
from stealing the silver or spitting in the soup. Nor do
professionals who recognize the danger of drug use to their
colleagues, need to turn to the law. They have far more effective
ways of bringing the behavior of these colleagues into line -
once they accept the need to draw such a line. </p>

<p>In many ways our society resembles the American family in the
1960's. Many parents then believed they were doing their children
a favor by laying back and not taking a hard-line stand against
drugs. They allowed youngsters to stumble through the drug
experience. Only later they came to realize the costs. Those
costs ran high, both in chronic impairment and lost educational
and career opportunities. As a result, parental attitudes have
changed markedly. Parents are now taking the hard line, which is
really the loving line, one that shows responsible concern. </p>

<p>More recently, the Navy has demonstrated how to go about
attacking drug use on the demand side. While it brought heavy
weapons into play - drug tests and disciplinary actions - it also
effectively reduced widespread tolerance for drug use. By
stressing the interdependence of seamen, the Navy began replacing
this attitude with a far more responsible one expressed by the
motto: &quot;Not on my watch, not on my ship, not in my
Navy.&quot; </p>

<p>This is the kind of attitudinal change I expect to see
occurring throughout the country over the next decade. It is
already underway. Adolescents have become far more critical of
drug use by their friends, and this is the result not only of
better drug education in the schools, but also of more awareness
of drug dangers on the street. Employers are now responding to
increasing evidence of economic costs directly attributable to
drug use in the work force. </p>

<p>So, there is every reason to believe that public attitudes
about illicit drugs will become firmer and more responsible. As a
result, the limitations on what we have been able to achieve
through prevention, through treatment, and through law
enforcement, will gradually be removed. They will no longer
dictate strategy that prevent us from moving as aggressively
against domestic demand as we do against foreign supply. </p>

<p>If law enforcement is to work effectively in cooperation with
treatment and with prevention in this attack on the demand side,
then we need to adopt consistent goals. While we should certainly
persist in interdiction and target major dealers, we cannot focus
most of our energy and resources on these high visibility
efforts. It is on the street that the final battle is going to be
won, and it will be won by constant pressure, over time, that
will be felt by every drug dealer and every drug user. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure will not result in any impressive string
of convictions, but it will respond directly to the desperate
needs of drug-ridden communities. It will strengthen
drug-troubled families, and it will improve the quality of life
for millions of Americans. </p>

<p>This kind of pressure, supported by a popular mandate, will
result in the gradual erosion of the drug market and the gradual
decline of drug use. Demand for treatment will grow. Prevention
will cease to be selective but reach out broadly across all
society. And drug abuse, while it may never entirely disappear,
will cease to pose any substantial threat to the nation, its
youth.<br>

<h1>America's Habit </h1>

<h2>Drug Abuse, Drug Trafficking, &amp; Organized Crime </h2>

<p><b>President's Commission on Organized Crime, 1986 </b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Consultant Paper: Preventing Drug Abuse: What Can We Do? </h2>

<p>By Dr. Arnold M. Washton. Submitted: October 1, 1985. Dr.
Washton is Director of the Addiction Research and Treatment
Center, The Regent Hospital, New York, New York; and Research
Director of The National Cocaine Hotline &quot;800-COCAINE,&quot;
Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, New Jersey. </p>

<p>The most dramatic increase in drug use has occurred since the
1960's, a time of radical change in political and social beliefs,
lifestyles and mores. Traditional values, authorities, and
restrictions on behavior were vehemently challenged. Psychoactive
drugs and the breakdown of traditional taboos against using them
became symbols of the rebellion against the established order. We
have come to recognize in the 1980's that we are paying a very
high price for the casual attitude towards drugs that developed
in the 1960's. Much misinformation has been corrected, and we
have begun to formulate a more realistic appraisal of the
problem, but now we must take specific actions to reduce the
demand for drugs. </p>

<p>Interventions that merely condemn drug use and try to frighten
children about the potential dangers (&quot;scare tactics&quot;)
are futile. The most effective prevention strategies are those
that address the factors that make drugs attractive and thwart
the process that leads youngsters to try them. Children use drugs
for many different reasons. Usually there are at least several
factors that enter into the decision to experiment or continue
with drug use. Drug use itself is no evidence that parents have
failed to properly raise their children. Many children with a
good family upbringing have yielded to the enormous outside
pressures to use drugs. The influence of peers can often override
even the best parental input. </p>

<p>Effective drug abuse prevention must address the most basic
and fundamental forces that promote drug-taking in our society.
These fall into two main categories: supply and demand. </p>

<p>Reducing Supply </p>

<p>Reducing the supply of illicit drugs is an obvious way of
curtailing use. Although this does little to alter the demand for
drugs, the widespread availability and abundant supplies of many
different types of powerful mood-altering substances makes it
easier for our citizens to become involved in drug use. It
reinforces the notion that illicit drugs are an expected part of
American life. People are more likely to try drugs when they are
surrounded by them - and children are no exception. Most American
adolescents know someone who &quot;deals&quot; drugs, uses drugs,
or is able to get them. </p>

<p>To counter the supply problem, we must continue to enforce and
strengthen our laws against the manufacture, sale, and possession
of drugs. We must also take a firmer stand against drug-producing
countries that receive American foreign aid. </p>

<p>The failure of Prohibition is a dramatic example of how
difficult it is to eliminate the use of a drug by law enforcement
efforts alone; especially when the drug is so well-entrenched in
society. Nonetheless, to legalize drugs, such as cocaine,
marijuana, or heroin would cause nothing short of a national
disaster. When drugs are cheaper and more readily available, more
people use them, become addicted to them, and suffer serious
consequences to their health and functioning. Legalization of
drugs would create an epidemic of unprecedented proportions. </p>

<p>Although enforcement efforts are necessary to check abuse,
they cannot prevent the problem by themselves. Neither can
treatment programs, which are utilized only after a serious drug
abuse problem has been identified. </p>

<p>Reducing Demand </p>

<p>Prevention of drug use in the United States must focus
intensively on the problem of demand. The cultural forces that
encourage and perpetuate drug use in our society must be
eliminated. We must recognize that drugs have become a
deeply-ingrained part of American life and that prevention cannot
occur unless social attitudes toward drug use change. Changing
social attitudes toward drugs is a difficult undertaking, but not
an impossible one. Many segments of society must become involved
in the effort. The message that drug use is unacceptable,
unhealthy, and unnecessary must be communicated in a credible and
consistent manner by the family, schools, media, business
community, medical and legal experts, politicians, professional
athletes, and other public figures. This message must be
reflected in every aspect of American life including education,
entertainment, business management practices, and law
enforcement. Being free of drugs must become a highly desirable
personal attribute: one that is seen as mandatory for success in
our society. One might hope that non-involvement with drugs would
become at least as desirable as physical fitness and
attractiveness. </p>

<p>Several prevention strategies are outlined below. </p>

<p>Recommendations </p>

<p>1. Public Education and Media Campaigns. The media is
potentially one of our most powerful prevention tools. It could
be used to better educate the public about the dangers of drugs
and to change attitudes about drug use through direct and
indirect communications. Public service messages, educational
programs, documentaries, and greater efforts to eliminate
pro-drug programs, might help to counteract accepting attitudes
toward drugs. </p>

<p>2. School-based Prevention Programs. Every school system in
the United States must have an active and creative drug abuse
prevention program. Prevention efforts, such as saying
&quot;NO&quot; to drugs and learning of their potential dangers,
must start in the early grades, not just in high school. Studies
show that drug use often starts before the 7th grade and that by
the time youngsters reach teenage it may be too late to change
their attitudes about drugs or their willingness to
&quot;try&quot; drugs. Nonetheless, early identification of
drug-abusing youngsters and swift efforts to ameliorate the
problem are essential in our nation's high schools. </p>

<p>In this regard, the &quot;Student Assistance Program&quot;
(SAP) in New York's Westchester County has served as a model
program to other school systems around the country. The SAP is
based on the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) model used
successfully in business and industry, utilizing on-site
substance abuse counselors, who are especially skilled at
identifying drug-abusing youngsters and providing the necessary
assistance or referral. </p>

<p>3. Education of Health Professionals. Despite epidemic levels
of drug abuse over the past two decades, most health
professionals receive no formal training in the diagnosis and
treatment of drug dependency. This situation must be corrected by
mandating that a core curriculum in the clinical management of
drug abuse problems be part of the training of physicians,
nurses, psychologists, social workers, and other health
professionals. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Drug Testing in DWIs. Currently, not a single state in
        the United States requires drug testing of drivers
        stopped for suspected driving under the influence of
        alcohol. Someone &quot;stoned&quot; on drugs may be able
        to pass a breathalyzer test with no difficulty, but still
        be too impaired to drive safely. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</h1>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p><b>by Tod Mikuriya, M.D.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report*, comprising some nine
volumes and 3,698 pages, is by far the most completed and
systematic study of marijuana undertaken to date. Because of the
rarity and, perhaps, the formidable size of this document, the
wealth of information contained in it has not found its way into
contemporary writings on this subject. This is indeed
unfortunate, as many of the issues concerning marijuana being
argued in the United States today were dealt with in the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report. </p>

<p>It is both surprising and gratifying to note the timeless and
lucid quality of the writings of these British bureaucrats. It
would be fortunate if studies undertaken by contemporary
commissions, task force committees and study groups could measure
up to the standards of thoroughness and general objectivity
embodied in this report. In the current context of violently
polarized attitudes toward marijuana, the prospect of a study of
similar stature would be improbably if not impossible.<br>
</p>

<p><b>History of British Involvement<br>
</b></p>

<p>The British government in India had substantial knowledge of
intoxicants other than alcohol because of their active
involvement in regulation, taxation and actual trafficking in
these substances for over a hundred years prior to the Hemp Drugs
Commission investigation and report. </p>

<p>In 1790 duties on alcohol and other intoxicant drugs were
first levied by the British on Landlords in India. The regulation
of cannabis preparations was further specified in 1793 in
regulation XXXIV of that year: &quot;No personal shall
manufacture or vend any such drugs (bhang* ganja**, charas*** and
other intoxicating drugs) without a license from the collector of
the zillah_.&quot; </p>

<p>This system of regulation was instituted &quot;with a view to
check immoderation consumption, and at the same time to augment
the public revenue.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1800 in a further modification of regulation, the
manufacture and sale of charas was prohibited as &quot;being of a
most noxious quality,&quot; while daily rates of duty were
declared as the basis for taxing procedures. Curiously, in 1824
the restriction on charas was rescinded &quot;as this drug was
found on examination to be not more prejudicial to health than
ganja or other intoxicating drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1849 limits on retail sale of cannabis drugs were fixed
&quot;for better securing the abkari__ revenue of Calcutta,&quot;
and later extended to the
__________________________________________________________ </p>

<p>* Leaves and flowers of wild growing or inferior cultivated
cannabis plants. </p>

<p>** Flowering tops of the cannabis plant </p>

<p>*** Resin from the mature cannabis plant </p>

<p>_ A county-sized district or administrative division (India) </p>

<p>__ Manufacture or sale of intoxicating Liquors or drugs;
hence, an excise or internal revenue tax on such manufacture of
sale (India) </p>

<p>[Abkar: A wine seller; distiller. Also, one whose trade is
subject to abkari tax]<br>
</p>

<p>whole of Bengal. Four years later the daily tax method was
abandoned and a fee charged on a per weight basis, and in 1860 an
additional set of dealers' fees imposed. </p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the system of the state of
Bengal was only one of several schemes among the many provinces.
Variations on this approach existed in the other states, a
function of the differing local administrations, reflecting the
degree of administrative and fiscal controls exerted by the
Imperial government. </p>

<p>There had apparently been controversies as to the possible
noxious effects of cannabis drugs, at least from the time of the
inception of British controls on these products, unless we assume
that the initial stated reasons for regulation were merely
cynical rationalizations for obtaining additional sources of
revenue. Within a country of several hundred millions of
inhabitants, divided into hundreds of regions, and with only
rudimentary &quot;homogenizing&quot; forces of effective
transportation and mass media, it is perhaps reasonable to infer
that wide variations in opinions and beliefs would be
encountered.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Formation of the Commission<br>
</b></p>

<p>On 2 March 1893 a question was raised in the British House of
Commons concerning the effects of the production and consumption
of hemp drugs in the province of Bengal, India. In response, the
Government of India convened a seven-member commission to look
into these questions, 3 July 1893. Upon the suggestion of Lord
Kimberley the scope of the investigation was expanded to include
all of India. </p>

<p>Procedures<br>
</p>

<p>The Commission actually met for the first time in Calcutta 3
August 1893. Between this date and 6 August of the following
year, when the study was finished, the Commission received
evidence from 1,455 witness. Field trips were made to thirty
cities in eight provinces and Burma from the end of October 1893
through the latter part of April 1894. Eighty-six meetings for
examination of witnesses transpired during the inquiry. Actual
participation of the members of the Commission was duly noted and
reported -- a custom that it might be worthwhile to revive:<br>
</p>

<p>The following statement shows the attendance of the members of
the Commission during the period occupied in inquiry (3rd August
1893 to April 1894):<br>

<p>49 days 25th April </p>

<p>29 days </p>

<p>The attendance of Raja Soshi Sikhareswar Roy was broken by
occasional absence caused by ill-health and other reasons. </p>

<p>The absence of Kanwar Harnam Singh during two short periods
was due to ill-health. The prolonged absence of Lala Nihal Chand
was due to the fact that he suffered from continued ill-health,
and was able to be with the Commission only at Calcutta at the
first; then for some part of their preliminary tour, and at a few
meetings for the examination of witnesses during the second tour.
All the members were present at Simla during the preparation of
the report. </p>

<p>Witnesses whose evidence was received by the Commission were
divided into three categories: </p>

<p>(1) Official witnesses able to give information regarding hemp
drugs, based on their official and local experience. </p>

<p>(2) Non-official witnesses of all ranks able to give
information regarding the drugs generally or in connection with
certain classes of the people. </p>

<p>(3) Other persons or associations having facts or holding
opinions which they desired to communicated to the Commission. <br>
</p>

<p>Civil Officers 467 </p>

<p>Medical Officers 214 </p>

<p>Private Practitioners (European methods) 34 </p>

<p>Private Practitioners (Native methods) 87 </p>

<p>Cultivators 144 </p>

<p>Professional men 55 </p>

<p>Missionaries 34 </p>

<p>Associations 24 </p>

<p>Persons Engaged in Trade 75 </p>

<p>Others <u>59</u> </p>

<p>1,455 </p>

<p>228* Native states </p>

<p>189* Native states<br>
</p>

<p>* Supplementary Volume - 1895<br>
</p>

<p>To facilitate collection of information, seventy questions
framed by the Commission were given to witnesses. The written
answers to these questions constituted the bulk of the evidence
before the Commission. Where appropriate, witnesses were examined
orally for further clarification or explanation. In addition,
witnesses who had not submitted written statements were examined
orally. It was duly noted in the record which forms of testimony
had been provided by the individual witnesses.<br>
</p>

<p>The following excerpts discusses evidence received in
testimony and from other sources. Philosophic premises concerning
roles and responsibilities of the individual are outlined as a
prelude to discussing the practical issues of taxation, political
policy, public safety and health. In applying the principles of
English Common Law to peoples in a subcontinent whose beliefs and
customs varied greatly from those of Great Britain, the issues of
feasibility and the common good were of prime concern. If schemes
of regulation of intoxicants followed this rationalistic model
today, the mistakes made then might not require repeating in each
generation. Current technologic advances do not produce progress
in the area of human behavior; they only help to magnify defects
and frailties. <br>

<p>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monumental study exposes the overriding and pervasive
powers of contemporary collective denial and moral failure
underpinning policies of cannabis prohibition. Motivated by
convenient moralism, questions are repeatedly disingenuously
raised concerning the harm of hemp drugs, cannabis, or marijuana.
The engine of agitprop bureaucratic ire fires up. Hearings are
scheduled, witnesses heard, proceedings transcribed, summarized,
presented to the requesting organization, discussed, filed, and
forgotten. The prohibition policies go on. Enforcement,
corrections systems strain under the demands of majoritarian
magical beliefs in coercive powers of Government; promoted by
continuing self-serving Government misinformation and censorship.
From the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission's policy perspective,
today's drug polices would be unthinkable. <br>
</p>

<p>In the century since the resolution passed the British House
of Commons setting up the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission that
resulted in this massive inquiry documented in a nine volume
report there have been drastic changes in public policy in the
United States and Great Britain.<br>
</p>

<p>The Indian hemp drug regulation policies were explicitly
predicated upon optimal and minimal government intervention.<br>
</p>

<p>The subsequent century in the United States, Great Britain,
and Europe has seen pandemic spread of prohibitionist
authoritarian Government interference- the American Disease-
social experiment run amok. <br>
</p>

<p>Income taxes, mass conscription, and two world wars have seen
regression from utilitarian governance of enlightened
non-interference to intrusive majoritarian autocracy.
Authoritative Government has become authoritarian. Less and less
Government justification and demonstrated necessity are needed.
The principle of non-interference is virtually inoperative. The
space of human existence where a person reigns uncontrolled
contracts even further. The large departments of individualistic
human life are contracted or eliminated by laws, public and
corporate policy. <br>
</p>

<p>The second intervention by Government; giving advice and
promulgating information has seen a parallel degradation. From
legitimate and trustworthy dissemination of factual information
through the institutions of science and medicine to censorship,
giving bad advice, dissimulation and deception in the service of
coercion and manipulation. The ensuing chaos of ignorance,
partial truths, and outright lies has produced a cacophonous
toxic confusion surrounding the use of hemp drugs. The font of
contemporary knowledge is now a stinking swamp, hopelessly
poisoned by the ignorant fantasies, fears, and untruths resulting
from prohibitionists' drug propaganda efforts. <br>
</p>

<p>Fifty years after the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report in
America the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana reported on
use of the drug after a five year study, seven years after
national marijuana prohibition. The perspective was based on the
premise that departments of human life and individual circle with
uncontrolled reign did not include the right to use marihuana.
The authoritative Government intervention of Prohibition is now
accepted; the non-interference principle of the Millsean Indian
Hemp Drugs Administration policy; dead- a luxury enjoyed,
ironically, by people of India subjugated by the British
imperium.<br>
</p>

<p>Descriptions of marihuana use were now from the perspective of
studying the characteristics of the users of this illicit drug:
to what extent, method of distribution, attitude of smoker toward
society and use of the drug, relationship with eroticism, crime,
and juvenile delinquency. Discussions of legitimacy of Government
intervention are by implication discussing the relative
dangerousness of marihuana. The legitimacy of Prohibition as a
social policy was neither justified nor discussed. Religious use
or freedom is not mentioned.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;I am glad that the sociological, psychological, and
medical ills commonly attributed to marihuana have been found to
be exaggerated insofar as the City of New York is concerned. I
hasten to point out, however, that the findings are to be
interpreted only as a reassuring report of progress and not as
encouragement to indulgence, for I shall continue to enforce the
laws prohibiting the use of marihuana until and if complete
findings may justify an amendment to existing laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1970 revision in Government marihuana prohibition
policy generated another report in 1972: Marihuana: a Signal of
Misunderstanding- First Report of the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse. <br>
</p>

<p>Individual rights are at least discussed in order to be
heavily discounted:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;So, while we agree with the basic philosophical precept
that society may interfere with individual conduct only in the
public interest, using coercive measures only when less
restrictive measures would not suffice, this principle merely
initiates inquiry into a rational social policy but does not
identify it. We must take a careful look at this complicated
question of the social impact of private behavior. And we must
recognize at the outset the inherent difficulty in predicting
effects on the public health and welfare, and the strong
conflicting notions of what constitutes the public
interest.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Religious freedom&quot; as currently delineated by the
Government places the burden on the individual to pass certain
&quot;tests&quot; to prove that hemp drugs used for sacramental
purposes:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Cases dealing with religious freedom in other contexts
have isolated three distinct foci of inquiry when a law is
challenged as violative of the &quot;free exercise&quot; clause:
(1) Is the claimant's belief and practice really a
&quot;religion&quot; within the meaning of the First Amendment?
(2) If so, is the practice prohibited by the challenged statute
essential to the practice of the &quot;religion?&quot; (3) Even
if the answers to (1) and (2) are yes, is there nevertheless a
sufficiently compelling state interest to warrant overriding the
practice? Only when the proscribed activity is essential to a
qualified &quot;religion&quot; and the state's interest is not
overwhelming will the courts invoke the First Amendment to
invalidate an otherwise permissible legislative
proscription.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In the 1989 Carl Olsen, a white Rastafarian and director of
Iowa NORML unsuccessfully attempted a religious freedom defense
for charges of marijuana selling and importation for distribution
to other members of the Ethiopian Coptic Zion Church.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;If the 'compelling interest' test is to be applied...it
must be applied across the board, to all actions thought to be
religiously commanded... Any society adopting such a system would
be courting anarchy.... The rule respondents favor would open the
prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from
civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind- ranging from
compulsory military service....to the payment of taxes.....drug
laws.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Dutifully crafted by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, now on the
supreme court, no question of how authoritative interference of
Government is accepted to be appropriate public policy. Religious
freedom is now restricted to activity that must be asserted and
proven rather than assumed. Proving compelling interest has
switched from the Government to the individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Departments of human life were seen not to be imperiously
guarded for the individual but regarded with mistrust and source
of opportunities for dissent against public policy. At the height
of the Vietnam war marijuana use was strongly identified with the
growing student antiwar resistance.<br>
</p>

<p>The non-intervention principle is at least recognized but the
departments of individuality and circle around the individual
were routinely stepped over by Government with justification in
this case for national security. Militarism preempted any
considerations of individual rights of privacy. Departments of
human life were small and confined to cosmetic obligatory
institutional ritual displays in the context of growing public
resistance to the American military industrial behemoth run amok
in southeast Asia.<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the cautious conclusion of the Commission to
critically examine the policies of marijuana prohibition, the
report was conspicuously rejected sight unseen by then president
Richard M. Nixon to demonstrate his being &quot;tough on
crime&quot; in a presidency struggling to end the Vietnam war. <br>
</p>

<p>Twenty-two years later on the centennial of the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission Report finds the principle of Government
non-interference is an all but forgotten faded idealistic icon,
given hollow obeisance at state ceremonies, a quaint
philosophical curiosity of the past. The circle around the
individual is reduced to a pale, flaccid, tattered, transparent,
and permeable membrane. Intrusion is limited only by available
funding to Government interference. The worsening of the balance
of power between the individual and state has increased by an
order of magnitude, facilitated by advances in technology. <br>
</p>

<p>Toqueville in his prophetic Democracy in America warns of
dangerous forms of despotism in democratic, egalitarian America: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;A great many persons of the present day are quite
contented with this sort of compromise between administrative
despotism and the sovereignty of the people; and they think they
have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when
they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large.
This does not satisfy me: the nature of him I am to obey
signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free
agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the
will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the
uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for
these things; it has predisposed men to endure them and often to
look upon them as benefits.<br>
</p>

<p>After having thus successively taken each member of the
community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will, the
supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community. It
covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated
rules, minute and uniform, through which the most original minds
and most energetic characters cannot penetrate, to rise above the
crowd. The will of the man is not shattered, but softened, bent,
and guided; men are seldom forced by it to act, but they are
constantly restrained from acting. Such a power does not destroy,
but it prevents existence, it does not tyrannize, but it
compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till
each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid
and industrious animals, of which the government is the
shepherd.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Attacked by oaths of &quot;drug free,&quot; informers
(including children), undercover police, drug-sniffing dogs,
random and warrantless searches, child snatching, drug testing,
forfeiture of property, surveillance of bank, business,
electricity, and other records, the departments of human life
wither. The parts of human life considered reserved territory are
noticeably smaller- the individual, society and
&quot;civilization&quot; suffer the loss.<br>
</p>

<p>Review of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report is important
for perspective in assessing the legitimacy and direction of
contemporary Government drug policy in a democratic society.
Froude's theorem of functional governance: &quot;no laws are of
any service which are above the working level of public morality,
and evasion.&quot; was of importance to feudal England, the
Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1894 and a century later a public
policy issue of prime magnitude. <br>

<p align="center">INDIAN HEMP AND THE DOPE FIENDS OF OLD ENGLAND </p>

<p align="center"><b>A sociopolitical history of cannabis and the
British Empire 1840-1928</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Sean Blanchard &amp; Matthew J. Atha MSc</b></p>

<p>When the report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission (IHDC)
reached 1890's England it met official and public apathy. There
was no political debate. It went into the 'forget about this'
file on arrival and has stayed there ever since. There was no
publicity; The news that &quot;Ganja is not appreciably
harmful&quot; was of no concern to the majority of users, who
took cannabis products for their medical benefits. The
non-medical users were mostly artists who didn't <u>mind </u>a
little harm. Prohibitionist sentiment was concentrated on the
opium trade between India and China and on alcohol at home.
Cannabis use in England was considered negligible, and the
authorities were content to have no laws at all controlling <b>it
</b>for another thirty years.<br>
</p>

<p>When laws were later proposed, the Government paid no
attention to the evidence in their possession from the IHDC. In
India, the recommendations of the IHDC report for control by
taxes rather than prohibition went into force quietly,
standardising laws and tariffs on cannabis in all the provinces.
In March 1895, the Indian Government passed a resolution after
reviewing the report. It said that for the last twenty years
their policy had been of &quot;restraining use and improving the
revenue by the imposition of suitable taxation&quot; and
&quot;imposing as high a rate of duty as can be levied without
inducing illicit practices&quot; on the grounds that &quot;the
best way to restrict the consumption of drugs is to tax
them...&quot; So, &quot;to that policy the Governor-General...
has decided steadily to adhere.&quot;[1]<br>
</p>

<p>There was never any suggestion that the same rules might be
applied in the UK; the Empire didn't work like that. The
Governor-General (also known as Viceroy), Lord Landsdowne, was
appointed by the UK Government. When they instructed him to
commission a report, he did so, then accepted or rejected it,
passed any regulations needed, and told the UK what he'd done.
His job was to 'keep natives in their place' and help the British
get on with de, not to give advice on home affairs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>From Mother's Friend to Opium Wars<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cannabis was virtually irrelevant to 19th century England. The
drug of the century was opium, freely available to the British
population and so popular that the government went to war to
prevent the prohibitionist Chinese disrupting the trade. The
opium wars still write their history in the 1990s, as Britain is
soon due to hand back Hong Kong, the territory it won from China
and those territories leased for 150 years, in 1997.<br>
</p>

<p>Thomas De Quincy, in his 'Confessions of and English Opium
Eater' gave the first popular account of the '...marvellous
agency of opium, whether for pleasure or pain'. He may have been
the first glamouriser of the psychotropic effects of the drug,
but, for most people opium was a friend and medicine as
indispensable as aspirin or Valium in the 20th century. Godfrey's
cordial, or chemists' home-brewed versions of popular patent
medicines, were used to quiet children, while no home would be
without laudanum (alcoholic tincture of opium). Opium was first
used in the treatment of cholera in the epidemics of the early
19th century, and continued to be used for the treatment of
diarrhoea and sickness, common complaints in the less <u>than </u>hygienic
environment of the day. It was during the Crimean war that the
analgesic effects were fully exploited, and it is certain that
the widespread use of laudanum, Collis Browne's mixture or other
opium-based medicines, available to the poor for a penny a
bottle, enabled ordinary people to cope with the harsh realities
of life in Dickensian England. From the government's point of
view, it was no doubt preferable to have the poor in a state of
comfortable stupor than rioting on the streets.<br>
</p>

<p>India was not the main source of opium for the domestic
market. Most of this was grown in Turkey or Persia (Iran), as
this opium was of generally high qualify, and trade flourished in
the period following the end of the Napoleonic wars, particularly
after the treaty of Balta Limon (1838) granting the Ottoman
Empire 'most favoured nation' trading status[2]. Indian opium,
however, was responsible for one of the British Government in
India becoming the largest drug-trafficking syndicate in the
world during the latter part of the century.<br>
</p>

<p>Opium and tea were the mainstays of the British East India
Company, who had a monopoly on the opium produced in Bengal. In
1772 Warren Hastings, then chief executive of the company,
realised the potential for foreign revenue in exporting Indian
opium to China. Opium had been known in China for centuries, but </p>

<p>imports bad been banned in 1729 by decree of the Emperor. An
foreign trade was funneled through Canton, opium being smuggled
with legitimate consignments in British ships, and sold through
corrupt officials to an eager market Other traders smuggled opium
to China overland, and the consumption spread to all levels of
society, even to the personal retinue of the Emperor. Exports to
China rose from 10,000 chests ill 1820 to 40,000 chests in 1840.
By 1836, a Chinese official in Canton, Hsu Nal-chi, petitioned
the emperor to legalise the trade after witnessing the failure of
prohibition... &quot;the severer the interdicts against (opium)
became, the more widely do the evils therefrom spread.&quot; He
was summarily dismissed from his post and replaced with a
committed &quot;war on drugs&quot;-minded individual, Lin
Tse-hsu.<br>
</p>

<p>Lin was determined to wipe out the opium trade by threatening
the British merchants with the loss of the tea trade, and in 1839
forced them to surrender 20,000 chests of the drug. Captain
Charles Elliot the British Chief Superintended, retaliated by
ordering all British ships out of the Canton estuary,
transferring the tea trade to American ships who would transport
their cargoes to Hong Kong, an inconvenience, but not an
obstacle, to the trade. Instead of using Canton, smugglers would
take opium consignments ashore up and down the coast in sinall
boats, fast enough to evade the Customs craft. Meanwhile Elliot
had ordered an expeditionary force of naval steamships which
arrived in 1840 and put direct pressure on Peking. Lin was
dismissed and the trade continued uninterrupted following the
Chinese capitulation and the end of the first opium war in 1842.
To the domestic audience in the UK, Palmerston, the Prime
Minister, bad portrayed the war as an attempt to force the
Chinese to accept free trade. In reality, the only commodity
directly involved was -opium, tax revenue from which was becoming
increasingly important to the Indian Government [3]. <br>
</p>

<p>In Britain, the Conservative opposition was not satisfied with
Palmerston's explanations and they opposed the opium trade in the
1840 Commons debate. By the time they took power in 1841 their
tune had changed, and the trade continued to expand. The Chinese
government was effectively warned that no British ships should be
searched. Although fresh edicts against the drug were issued by
the Chinese, they were powerless to stop the trade following the
treaty of Nanking, which ceded Hong Kong to Britain, allowing a
bridgehead for further opium supplies. In 1856, following growing
and-British sentiment, the Chinese gave the British government a
further excuse for war by seizing the <i>Arrow, </i>a British
vessel with a crew of Chinese criminals anchored off Canton. The
fact that the <i>Arrow's </i>registration had expired,
technically justifying the Chinese action, was overlooked by
Palmerston, once again the Liberal Prime Minister after fighting
an election forced by government defeat on an opposition motion
condemning the war, and winning on a wave of patriotic fervour.<br>
</p>

<p>Lord Elgin was dispatched with an expeditionary force which
burned down the Summer Palace in Peking to impress upon the
Emperor the need to keep agreements. The main consequence of the
Second Opium War was that China was forced to legalise the trade
in opium, and were only permitted to tax the product at a level
acceptable to the British. Consumption increased from 60,000
chests in 1860 to 105,000 by 1880. The trade generated taxes to
the British Indian Government equivalent to over half their total
revenue, enough to cover the entire civil service and armed
forces budgets. In this climate, financial expediency, as so
often is the case, took precedence over the growing moral
arguments against the drug trade. <br>
</p>

<p>Following increased public pressure to end the trade, and in
response to a Parliamentary motion, the Government called a Royal
Commission on the production and consumption of opium, which was
only to consider prohibition among other options, after full
investigation. It was during these manoevres that the IHDC was
also established. The Indian Viceroy, Lord Lansdowne was against
anything that might disrupt business. Prime Minister Gladstone
was much more pro trade than he was anti drug. They packed the
opium commission with pragmatists from the Indian Civil Service,
with some of the more economically literate abolitionists, and
ensured that it would concentrate a good deal on money. It first
met in September 1893 and saw 2,500 witnesses by February '94.<br>
</p>

<p>When the report was published in '95, it said that opium was
&quot;generally used in moderation&quot;, and &quot;led to no
evident ill-effects&quot;. Even some senior anti-opiumists had
been convinced. The fact that Chinese missionaries were
overwhelmingly critical of the effects of opium, in contrast to
the Indian witnesses who were predominantly favourable towards
the drug, was put down to the fact that in India the drug is
normally taken orally, whereas in China it was generally smoked
[3]. There was only one dissent; Joseph Rowntree, one of the
committee members, was later to denounce the Commission's report
as a whitewash. By that time there was another election under
way. Prohibition had no chance under the Conservatives, and there
would be no Liberal government until 1905.(4). The government,
despite public opinion, was determined to continue the opium<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;The Lunatic asylums are filled with Ganja
Smokers.&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>The question of cannabis occasionally cropped up as an
incidental issue in skirmishes during the long legislative battle
against the opium business. As early as 1840 the pro-opium banker
William Bingham Baring MP told the Commons that if the opium
trade were suppressed then there would be a danger of users
turning to drugs &quot;infinitely more prejudicial to physical
health and energy than opium&quot;. Baring, one of 10 MPs of both
parties from the same pro-free trade family, was particularly
concerned about &quot;an exhalation of the Hemp plant, easily
collected at certain seasons, which is in every way more
injurious than the use of the poppy.&quot; [3] This was another
justification for the lucrative opium trade which flourished in a
climate of official and unofficial governmental encouragement.
However, attitudes were slowly changing and in 1875 Mark Steward
MP had proposed that the Indian Governor General be instructed to
investigate the opium trade &quot;with a view to gradual
withdrawal,&quot; and lost by 37 votes. Similar moves were
regularly defeated for the next twenty years. By April '91, a
spokesman for the Society for Suppression of the Opium Trade
(SSOT) had obtained a 30-vote majority for a motion that the
Governments' revenue from opium was &quot;Morally
indefensible&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p>On 16 July 1891 Stewart asked a three part question about
ganja [5]:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;i Whether the Secretary of State for India has seen a
report in the Allahabad Pioneer of 10 May that ganja, which is
grown sold and excised in much the same way as opium, is far more
harmful, and that &quot;the lunatic asylum of Bengal are filled
with ganja smokers.&quot; </p>

<p>ii Is he aware that<b> </b>ganja has been made illegal in
Lower Burma and that excise reports say this has been 'of
enormous benefit to the people.' </p>

<p>iii Will he call to the attention of the Governor General the
desirability of extending theprohibition to other
provinces?&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The answers to which were yes, yes, and that he would
&quot;Enquire whether further steps should be taken to limit
consumption...&quot; On 7 August 1892 those enquiries were
answered at some length. The Viceroy's office told London that
the whole question had been extensively discussed with provincial
administrations in 1871-73. They sent 174 pages of old dispatches
from Indian provincial governments to the centre, and from there
to London. After considering these, &quot;The Governor General is
of the opinion that while ganja may be among the most noxious of
all intoxicants commonly used in India... even if absolute
prohibition could be enforced, the result might be to induce the
use of more noxious drugs&quot; (e.g. datura). Apart from which
it would be impossible to enforce a prohibition. It was &quot;Our
duty to restrict consumption, but unnecessary to do more than
persevere in the policy established In 1873.&quot; These papers
languished unread in London, perhaps because there was a general
election going on.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1873 dispatches showed the pragmatism of imperial
administrators which was to be repeated by the IHDC, in very
similar words. The then Viceroy had said that while the
Government should endeavour to restrict the use of ganja, it
would be impossible to enforce general prohibition, especially
because of religious feelings in some groups and because the
plants grew freely some areas. It would be inexpedient to order
what could not be enforced... &quot;It does not appear to the
Governor-General to be specifically proved that hump incites to
crime more than other drugs or spirits.&quot; There was also some
evidence that hump, &quot;usually so noxious&quot;, might
usefully be taken for medical reasons. There was no doubt that
habitual use tended to cause insanity but not in very many cases
relative to the numbers of the insane.(6]. &quot;General opinion
seems to be that the evil effects of Ganja have been
exaggerated.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The dispatches from regional governments were more forthright.
The Lt.-Governor of the Punjab wrote that considering the
practicalities, they should not restrict hemp drug use unless
there was proof of connection with crime. Civil, police and
medical officers disagreed on the details but: &quot;His Honour
is of the opinion that if people were prohibited from using
preparations of hemp or opium, they would, in all probability,
have recourse to some other stimulant, such as alcohol, the crime
resulting from the use of which would be much greater than that
resulting from the abuse of these drugs .... It seems that the
amount of crime, violent or other, incited by ganja, is
exceedingly small... If, therefore, these preparations have no
effect on crime and only injure the persons who use them, it is
difficult to see in what manner the law can restrict their use in
a country where opium is a monopoly of the Government, the
effects of which are perhaps as injurious when taken in excess as
those of hemp.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The local governments of Mysore, Hyderbad, Oudh, and Burma
said that as hump drugs were little used locally, not necessary.
Central Provinces sent plenty of data but no opinions. The
Northwest Provinces (later Pakistan), one of the main cannabis
growing areas, said the evidence on crime was confused, where if
the situation was bad as supposed there would surely be a
consensus. To stop production would be almost impossible, so they
could not recommend attempts to limit or stop consumption.
Bombay, Madras, and Bengal said that restrictions and taxes
already in place should be preserved. All agreed excessive use to
be somehow connected with physical harm and perhaps insanity, but
the numbers harmed were very small. Bengal sent the most
information. Asked if a particularly popular type of local ganja
was more deleterious than others, they submitted a long report on
cultivation, uses and profit margins on all hemp products by Dr
Watt, State Reporter on Economic Products. Their local product
was popular due to the quality of plants and traditional
production skills, rather than sheer strength. A table of samples
analysed for &quot;Resinous extracts or Cannabin&quot; ranged
from 1.4% (NW Province) to 12% (Madras), mostly about 4% [7]. All
of the legal trade was inside India. The state of Bengal had been
making an average 1 million rupees per year through the 1860's in
tax on ganja shops and duty at government auctions, about
100,000 - tens of millions in today's money.<br>
</p>

<p>When these papers were taken from the files, twenty years
after they were written, the August 1892 elections were under
way. The Conservatives went out and the Liberals came in. Drug
control was not high on their agenda; however, the new Home
Secretary, Foreign Secretary, and Secretary of State for India
were all known to be anti-opium, and the Prime Minister had
spoken out against it in the past. The prohibitionists knew they
might get some sort of opium control agreed if it didn't oppose
the Liberals' central Free Trade policy. Believing their moment
had come, they began to quarrel among themselves.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Criminalise it!<br>
</b></p>

<p>Before the development of the hypodermic syringe by Alexander
Wood, the main concern about opium was not the threat of
addiction, but the danger of poisoning. Only after the 1860s did
the risk of dependency start to cause concern among the medical
profession. Certainly, people would have been habituated to the
drug, but the stereotype of the drug addict had yet to gain
acceptance within the UK. Even where individuals wrote of their
habit, such as a chemists wife who had been using morphia for 30
years, described her experience in a matter of fact way, free
from any sense of stigma her major concern being the perceived
tendency of the drug to cause her to put on weight. Although the
dependency syndrome had been described two centuries earlier by
Thomas Sydenham, the risk was not taken seriously by most medical
practitioners. Following increasing reports of dependency
symptoms after 1860, culminating in a series of articles in <i>The
Practitioner </i>in<i> </i>1870, the debate on the wisdom of
permitting free access to opium accelerated. In 1878 Edward
Levinstein in Germany started the 'moral' argument about the
effect of opium on the character of the user, and was one of the
first to promote abstinence as a cure for the addict [2].<br>
</p>

<p>From the 1840s on, there were several anti-opium
organisations, all small and mostly broke. Their memberships
overlapped, but the leaders didn't get on well. None of them had
ever tried to gain mass support. The first organisation to come
out against the trade were the Birmingham Quakers. In 1869, Lord
Shaftesbury urged the Indian government to withdraw from its
monopoly position in the trade. By 1884 the Society for the Study
and Cure of Inebriety, founded by Sir Norman Kerr, aimed &quot;to
educate the professional and the public mind to the dangers of
intemperance&quot;. At that time, alcohol was the main target for
the temperance movement, whereas other, more exotic drugs were
not seen as much of a threat to respectable Britons. These drugs
were not expected to be a threat to the well-adjusted British
gentleman, and habituation among the Chinese and others was
regarded as the kind of 'filthy foreign habit' that should be
stopped for the foreigners' own good. Kerr recognised the dangers
of opium with a crusading zeal, and railed against its use,
denying any possibility that some persons could be able to
restrict their use to a moderate level. The Society for
Suppression of the Opium Trade (SSOT), founded in 1874, became
the best-known anti-opium organisation, but had always been
elitist, controlled by Quaker businessmen with knighthoods,
funded by one family. Their best argument combined economic and
humanitarian interest; other exports to China had been damaged by
the sleaziness of the opium business. Trade with China had been
stagnant between 1860-80 while business with Japan had tripled.
The SSOT moved for ending the India-China opium trade, and an
enquiry into alternate ways of making up the money. They took too
long agreeing a proposal with other lobbyists, but did manage to
force the government to concede the 1893 Royal Commission on
Opium [8].<br>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in February '93, William Caine, MP (Bradford East),
had the papers on ganja collected the previous year placed in the
House of Commons Library. 0u the 2nd March 1893 he put a public
question to the Under-secretary of State for India. &quot;If he
will instruct the Government of India to create a commission of
experts to enquire into and report on the cultivation of and
trade in all preparations of hemp drugs in Bengal, the effects of
theft consumption on society, and on the moral condition of the
people, and the desirability of prohibiting its growth and
sale.&quot; Would he also invite written reports on the same
matters from all other provinces, and include in the commission
non-official natives of India. The Secretary of State would ask
the Viceroy to do just that, &quot;and he will be glad if the
result of this inquiry is to show that further restriction can be
placed upon the sale and consumption of these drugs.&quot;(7)
Since the Government seemed so amenable, a secondary question by
the Right Hon. Sir Charles E. Schwann, Bart, was then dropped.<br>
</p>

<p>The members of the commission were named on 3rd July, and held
their first meeting on 2nd August - a mouth before the Opium
commission began to meet. They continued until April, seeing over
800 witnesses, assembling over 3000 pages into seven volumes, and
a confidential extra volume on hemp drug use in the Army; then
the Finance and Commerce department of the Government of India
considered the report, and another British election crept closer.
It is unclear what Caine and Schwann thought they were up to.
Both were Liberals, Temperance campaigners, and probably
anti-opium. Schwann had a safe scat, a comfortable merchants'
fortune and radical opinions. Caine wrote books, including 'Young
India', 'Picturesque India' and 'A Trip Around the World.' He had
quit the Liberal Party six years earlier over the Irish question,
and been re-admitted in a new scat after losing as an
Independent; he was to lose it again in 1895. The timing, and the
request for the commission to include non-official Indians,
suggest that they were part of a faction among the
anti-opiumists, perhaps trying to stir them into holder demands
or quicker action. Perhaps they were simply trying to get in on
what looked like a winning side. Neither is recorded as ever
mentioning hemp drugs in public again.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Dope Fiends of Old England<br>
</b></p>

<p>The international drugs trade was quite a different thing from
home consumption; for example although the British Empire
produced a great deal of the worlds' opiates, over 80% of the
opium used in the UK was from Turkey and Persia [2]. The economic
pressure for international prohibition came from traders and
nations with rival products. In the UK drug control was at first
pan of an increase in medical involvement in social policy.
Prescription by professionals had to take over from
self-medication before complete prohibition became possible.<br>
</p>

<p>There was not much openly recreational drug use in Victorian
England, other than alcohol. A few serf consciously
unconventional young artists and mystics searched for inner
experience, rejecting vulgar materialism, but the majority of
drug abusers, then as now, considered themselves to be taking
medicines, to help them work or relax. This was an age which
demanded refinement, in every sense of the term. They took
extracts, tinctures, distillations or the 'active ingredients' of
traditional medicinal plants like Indian hemp or poppies, in
amounts that would kill modern addicts. This was all for the good
of their health, so morally impeccable. They didn't do dope to
get wasted, or didn't admit to it<br>
</p>

<p>Vulgar materialism provided ever more purified forms of relief
from the stresses of righteous life, as opium was dissolved into
laudanum, concentrated into morphine, re-concentrated into
heroin. Some condemned booze while chewing opium, just as
well-known modern anti-drug campaigners have been tranquilliser
addicts. In this atmosphere Cannabis Indica was just another
potentially useful plant, which could be perhaps refined into
some sort of medicine but was quite unsuitable in natural form.
The distinction between drug use and abuse had hardly been
invented. Doctors were expensive and not well trusted, so the
poor dosed themselves with whatever remedies they could afford.
Pseudo-medical opiate use was decreasing, but still respectable;
Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Florence Nightingale had used it,
and William Wilberforce, saint of the anti-slavery movement, had
eaten twelve grains a day for thirty years. Self-medication
bluffed into non-medical use. Boozing was low class and
unfeminine, so respectable ladies took &quot;tonics.&quot; Patent
medicines were a huge business, often including alcohol, opium,
or cannabis.<br>
</p>

<p>Sales of pure morphine, cocaine, and barbiturates were
supposedly controlled by the 1868 Poisons and Pharmacy Act, but
quack nostrums and patent medicines were not, and an attempt to
extend the law in 1884 had failed. The Act only affected shops,
not users. One especially dangerous popular remedy was Collis
Brownes' Chlorodyne, containing chloroform and morphine, which
the British Medical Association campaigned through the 90's to
have banned.<br>
</p>

<p><b>&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess&quot; <br>
</b></p>

<p>There had been increasing medical interest in cannabis since
William O'Shaughnessy described the use of indian hemp as
medicine and intoxicant [9], relying on accounts of hashish use
from ancient Persian and Arabic sources, as well as on his own
observations in India. He described the use of hemp in the
treatment of rheumatism, hydrophobia, cholera, tetanus and
infantile convulsions, as well as describing the delirium induced
by continued use. O'Shaughnessy had written in 1839 that, with a
couple of exceptions, &quot;I have been unable to trace any
notice of the employment of this drug in Europe.&quot; However,
despite citing western works by Ainslie and von Estebeck he
managed to overlook one classic account. <br>
</p>

<p>The noted medieval herbalist, Nicholas Culpepper (1616-1654),
listed a variety of medical uses of the common european hemp
(Cannabis sativa), including anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and
antiparasitic activity [10]. Culpepper made no mention of the
psychotropic activity, although the temperate hemp he described
would normally be of low drug content and be grown for fibre.
Culpepper's work would have owed much to the folk herbalism used
by British witches, or wise women, who until the christian
persecutions had provided most primary health care to the rural
population, as well as to the monastic healers who replaced them.
By the Victorian &quot;age of reason&quot; most traditional use
had been suppressed, as the pioneer pharmacologists began to
analyse folk medicines to refine and extract the active compounds
therein. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in the 1840's to
grow hemp for medicine in the London suburb of Mitcham.
Experimenters used it for athsma and other chest problems,
sleeplessness especially in cases of opiate or alcohol
withdrawal, and with opium and bromide of potassium in treating
insanity.<br>
</p>

<p>One reason why cannabis was not as widely used as opium
products, or the newer chemical remedies, was the difficulty
found refining an &quot;active ingredient.&quot; There were
problems getting supplies of reliable strength, confusion about
apparently different products from the same plant, and
uncertainty about its effects in the body. However, it was used
to treat many disorders. In 1889, Dr E.A.Birch described in the
Lancet the successful use of cannabis indica in the treatment of
chloral hydrate and opium withdrawal, drawing attention to the
abolition of craving and the antiemetic (vomit suppressing)
effects and the stimulation of appetite in patients who would not
normally eat, or keep down, their food [111. Queen Victoria's
personal physician, J.R. Reynolds described it in 1890 as
&quot;One of the most valuable medicines we possess.&quot; In
another Lancet article published in 1890, he described the use of
cannabis indica for treating insomnia in the senile, alcoholic
delirium, neuralgia, migraine, spastic paralysis, and convulsions
[12]..He allegedly prescribed tincture of cannabis to Queen
Victoria herself for the treatment of menstrual cramps. Cannabis
tincture and an extract made from resin were available from Peter
Squire of Oxford St in 1864, and wholesale through the Society of
Apothecaries by 1871. Chemists extracted stuff they called
cannabene, cannabin tannin, cannabinnene etc. but had no idea
which, if any, was the &quot;active ingredient&quot; until
cannabinol was isolated in 1895. <br>
</p>

<p>At the same time some thought of drug-taking as a form of
poisoning, and some researchers proposed that it either caused,
or was, a type of insanity. W.W. Ireland compared the mental
state of cannabis users to delirium, with its alteration of time
and space and visual illusions. British doctors' reports from
Cairo Asylum in 1894 linked violent insanity with
&quot;Hashism&quot;(13,14) Some of the medical studies would have
been recreational use in any other context. Walter Dixon must
have tried it on himself as well as small furry animals when he
showed in 1899 that the effects vary according to type of
preparation as well as method of ingestion. He recommended
smoking for immediate effect and wrote in the British Medical
Journal, &quot;Hemp taken as an inhalation may be placed in the
same category as coffee, tea and kola. It is not dangerous and
its effects are never alarming, and I have come to regard it in
this form as a useful and refreshing stimulant and food
accessory, and one whose use does not lead to a habit which grows
upon its votary.&quot; He was to be a member of the Rolleston
Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction in the 1920's, who
opposed criminalising narcotics policy.<br>
</p>

<p>At the end of the century cannabis tincture became popular
again as a cure for cramps, migraine, opium addiction, withdrawal
and insomnia, but the fashion faded. In the early 1900's a
British Medical Association campaign against 'Secret Remedies'
got most of the opiates, cocaine and cannabis out of tonics and
non-prescription medicines. Doctors became responsible for most
drug distribution as the consumer beverage trade withdrew. As
drag dispensing was professionalised, substances used for
self-medication were replaced by more refined, more medically
controllable drags. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission report made
no apparent difference to this at all, and it's quite possible
that nobody in the medical establishment read it. It held quite a
lot of scientific data but its purpose had been political rather
than medical. The political and economic interests of the British
Medical Association were quite different from those of the
Government of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Cosmopolitan Dope Fiends<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is worth noting that most publications from the time refer
to &quot;Hashish,&quot; the Arabic term, Indian Hemp, or
Cannabis, rather than Charas, Ganja or Bhang, the Hindi names.
The French empire in North Africa had at least as much effect on
European cannabis use as the British empire in India. A certain
style of drug use, the Wasted Artist role, as established by the
laudanum swigging Coleridge and De Quincey early in the century,
was revived by Dr Jean Moreau in Paris after 1845. The doctor,
who experimented with hashish to treat insanity, founded the Club
des Hashishins with the writer Theophile Gautier, for non-medical
experiments. Some of the members were quite keen on a little
delirium. Gautier was a hack with brilliant friends, an 'art for
arts sake' romantic with a taste for macabre fantasy who
encouraged the Symbolist poets. Rimbaud and Verlaine shared his
drugs. Baudelaire dedicated &quot;Fleur du Mal&quot; to him, and
wrote an essay that explained their attitudes: &quot;On Hashish
and Wine as a means of expanding individuality.&quot; They
created strange, sensuous art, struck foreign poses based on
their beliefs about the romantic East, scandalised bourgeois
society [15].<br>
</p>

<p>By the 90's the club had imitators in London. If there was no
recreational drug use &quot;subculture&quot; in the 1890's, <b>one
</b>network came close. This was the circle of poets, psychics,
writers and would-be magicians around the Rhymers Club and the
Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They didn't define their
connection by shared drug use, but they certainly included drug
experiments in their self-definition. Occult studies, drugs,
hypnotism, proto-psychiatry and new styles of arts were all
1890's fashions mingled in overlapping cliques in central London.
The Golden Dawn was established in 1888 by some occultist
Freemasons, as a society of &quot;Christian practiced magic. In
1890 Yeats and two others formed the Rhymers Club as a sort of
literary wing, drawing inspiration from the French Symbolists.
None of the Rhymers Club apart from Yeats ever achieved as much
recognition as their French heroes, but they had the style. They
were melancholy, self-dramatising, they hoped Byronic. They had
doomed love lives and nervous breakdowns, and mostly died young.
Their defiance of conventional society included such un-English
deviance as drinking black coffee and speaking comprehensible
French, as well as attempted magic, sexual permutations not
discussed in polite company, and hefty drug use.<br>
</p>

<p>Yeats and his lover Maude Gonne tried using hashish to improve
their telepathic powers. Others had a more relaxed, recreational
approach. Arthur Symons was one Rhymer who survived to he
described as &quot;highly strong, over-sensitive&quot; in the
1930's, best known for &quot;Confessions - A study in
Pathology&quot; which described his two years in an Italian
lunatic asylum and cure by near-fatal pneumonia in 1909. He was
the author of 'The Opium Smoker; &quot;I am engulfed, and drown
deliciously/soft music like a perfume, and sweet light/Golden
with audible odours exquisite/ swathe me in cerements for
eternity.../&quot;. In a biography of fellow Rhymer Ernest Dowson
he described one afternoon; a couple of ballet dancers and a poet
visiting, the host issuing tea, cakes, cigarettes and then
hashish. &quot;That slow intoxication, that elaborate experiment
in visionary sensations... he sat awaiting the magic, half shy in
the midst of that bright company of young people.&quot; Dowson
wrote poems with Latin titles <b>about </b>doomed love affairs,
and consorted with the &quot;most degraded&quot; women in
dockside dives. He experimented with mescal in 1896, with the
sexuality researcher Havelock Ellis. He died of TB in 1900, aged
32. The other poet present at the hash and tea party and the
mescal experiment was John Addington Symonds, a historian who
studied the criminal mentality - he was part blinded after
several breakdowns and TB. One of their associates, Count Eric
Stenbock, who wrote The Shadow of Death and Studies of Death, was
known for wearing a live snake around his neck; he died aged 35,
of either alcohol or opium.(13)<br>
</p>

<p>The Wasted Artists were picturesque and dramatic, and their
style became a popular image of drug abusers. Ethereal and rather
unhealthy, possibly creative but definitely pasty-faced. The
perception of a difference between drugs suitable for legitimate
use, under medical control, and drugs which can only be abused,
was extended by their example; anything they took was obviously
not doing any good for their health. Still there was no anti-drug
panic in the UK. Drugs were still seen as foreign stuff, only
used by those who wanted to act like foreigners. The artists were
added to an existing mythology of the opium addict and the opium
den, spread by popular fiction from Wilkie Collins to Oscar
Wilde, the addict over-sensitive, hollow-cheeked with torment,
the dens glided in rococo brothel style, populated by vicious
Chinese and degenerate aristocrats.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The Respectable Fear begins<br>
</b></p>

<p>The first demon dope stories came over from the USA in the mid
1890's. There were, apparently, ever-increasing numbers of Black
men with cocaine, Chinese with opium, and Mexicans with both,
plus marijuana. These coloured men were allegedly using their
fiendish substances to gain the flesh of white women, and many of
them would go crazy with big knives if frustrated in any way. The
British media only retold a few of these tales <b>at </b>first.
The pathological imagination of the US Press kept it up for the
next forty years, changing the drug and the villains' colour now
and again. Heroin was refined in 1898 but for the first few years
it was considered a miracle painkiller and cure for morphine
addiction. The subject of the grossest stories was cocaine, also
considered a miracle cure a few years earlier. The medical
enthusiasts didn't think it suitable for recreational use. The
recreational users disagreed. The alcohol prohibitionists built a
mass following and inflicted a huge social disaster on the USA.
When the alcohol ban was repealed, drug control was not. The
myths were retired for a few years, but similar stories can be
found, only slightly less racist, in the mass media today.<br>
</p>

<p>Before, during and after Prohibition, the USA lobbied for
international drugs laws, mixing economic self-interest with
moralism. The Hague Conference in 1912 agreed to the principle of
certain drugs being strictly for &quot;legitimate medical
purposes.&quot; It was never effective internationally because of
obstruction by the British opiate and German cocaine businesses.
The conference suggested an investigation of hemp, but it wasn't
followed up. The Assam Opium &amp; Ganja Committee of 1913(16)
showed that the IHDC had been forgotten or ignored in that
province of India, for instance accepting that ganja causes
insanity without calling any evidence. It did say that when ganja
prices rose users turned to opium, when opium prices rose they
turned to alcohol or, alarmingly, morphine. The number of
licensed shops in Assam had fallen from 1116 in 1878 to 347 in
1911, and the committee thought it couldn't be reduced further
without provoking unrest.<br>
</p>

<p>Recreational drug use in British literary circles in the '90s
spread through the next two decades into a wider worlds. Cocaine
use had spread well into the upper class by the First World War.
Officialdom grew concerned about officers on leave, who often
weren't afraid to wreck their health since their chances of
survival were slim. Morale would not be improved, it was felt, by
the sight of the upper ranks behaving like beasts, and it would
be worse yet if the common soldiers imitated them. There was a
press scare about the Germans using drugs and prostitutes,
collecting blackmail material. This unlikely tale and other
stories of moral degeneracy caught the imagination of the Army
Council, who banned the sale of all intoxicants to troops in mid
1916. In July the first U K law against possession of drags was
sneaked through, section 40B of the Defense of the Realm Act. It
covered cocaine and opiates; cannabis was not included, although
it had been considered. Section 40B also banned
&quot;Malththusian appliances&quot; (contraception) and quack
medicines. The same Act established legal closing times for pubs,
which caused a lot more fuss.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The post war scandal boom<br>
</b></p>

<p>Immediately after the Great War the British press got their
first US-style dope story. Actress Billie Carelton, age 21, died
supposedly from cocaine taken at an alcohol-free Victory Ball.
Her supplier was tried for manslaughter but could not be
convicted. It was just as likely the sleeping drug Veronal that
killed her, but that didn't bother the Daily Express. They
included hashish eating in the habits of a circle of degenerates
who, they said, had mined a sweet and innocent girl. In September
1920 a Dangerous Drugs Act was passed, clarifying the wartime
possession law and effectively dividing the drug trade into
medical vs criminal. It was greeted with such apathy by
Parliament <u>that </u>it was hard to make up a quorum in some of
the committees. Cannabis was still not banned.<br>
</p>

<p>Internationally, the UK government stopped blocking drug
controls after several scandals at home and reports that morphine
and cocaine addiction were spreading in the colonies. There were
more sex drugs and foreigner stories to keep up the postwar drug
scare. In 1922 the death of dancer Freda Kempton gained unwanted
publicity for Brilliant Chang, Chinese restaurant owner and
alleged dope king since 1917, handling morphine, opium and
hashish as well as cocaine. After many raids and mentions in the
press he was sentenced to 14 months - not much for such an
alleged villain - then departed in 1924. Eddie Manning, Jamaican
jazz drummer and alleged dope king, was convicted of dealing
opium and cocaine in '23. Both, it was strongly implied, had used
their dealing to get close to English girls. In 1922 three
sisters were found half dressed and unconscious in the company of
a dead Chinese man, Yee Sing a.k.a. Johnny Hop, in a sealed room
full of opium smoke above a Cardiff laundry. The girls never told
quite what had happened, so the press made it up, including a
Chinese love potion made from hashish used especially to subdue
white women, with an antidote made from geraniums.(17) Pulp
fiction by the likes of Sax Rohmer helped spread the corrupt
aristocrat and Chinese dope plot themes.<br>
</p>

<p>Despite all this advertisement, there was still no working
class drug subculture. The upmarket drug users of the 20's
continued to be found where the overlap between high society and
the arts copied what were seen as American fashions for jazz and
cocaine. Aleister Crowleys' 1922 novel, Diary of a Drug Fiend,
thinly disguised a real West End scene where cocaine was dealt in
the Cafe Royal on Regent Sweet. Crowley was a former Golden Dawn
member who publicised himself as &quot;The Wickedest Man in the
World,&quot; and ran a black magic cult largely based on sex. He
occasionally kicked his morphine habit cold turkey in front of
acolytes, to show the power of his will; he did quite a lot to
establish a link in the public mind between heavy drug use and
being a dangerous but pretentious creep. Chloroform and morphine
were popular with Lady Diana Cooper and Katherine Asquith, models
for several wild aristos in fiction. Morphine might be risky and
maybe immoral, but boozing was common, which was much worse.
Compared to these types cannabis users were sweethearts. Having
previously tried smoking it to no effect, the painter Augustus
John tried a hashish compote or jam after sardines and wine with
friends in Hampstead; &quot;...catching the eye of Iris, we were
both simultaneously seized with uncontrollable laughter, about
nothing at all...&quot; Despite the publicity, and penalties
increasing in 1922, prosecutions under the Dangerous Drugs Act
averaged a steady 60 a year for cocaine, 65 for opium. <br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis lust became illegal in the UK after the country
agreed the 1925 Geneva International Convention on Narcotics
Control. It was included in the '25 Convention with the opiates
and cocaine, because Egypt and Turkey proposed it. An Egyptian
delegate stirringly denounced &quot;Chronic Hashism&quot; which
he said caused most of the insanity in his country. It also, he
said, weakened users, gave them heart and digestive troubles and
made them look wild-eyed and stupid. India opposed including
cannabis in the Convention, as their delegate said it had been
used there since time immemorial, grew wild, and they doubted
that a prohibition could enforced. The British delegate abstained
from the vote but signed in the end. There was hardly any
parliamentary debate before it came into law as amendments to the
Dangerous Drugs Act on 281h September 1928. Despite this cannabis
offences, and 206 for opium. In 1950 for the first time there
were more prosecutions for cannabis than for opium and
manufactured drugs together - 86 against 41 opium and 42 others.
That year a series of police raids on jazz clubs produced a new
crop of stories about black men with drugs and white women, this
time involving marijuana and benzedrine. Cannabis had finally got
into the shock horror league.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Epilogue<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission finally had its moment in
Parliament in July 1967, after the Government had established an
Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence. J.J.S. Driberg, Chief of
Police and Inspector of Prisons for Assam, had given gave
evidence to the IHDC. His son Tom was a Labour MP. According to
his autobiography [18], the poet Alan Ginsberg asked Tom to
&quot;look up for him the report... in the House library I found
that my father had given evidence before this commission, putting
forward strongly the view that people living in a damp, cold
climate<u> </u>needed the traditional consolation of ganja... The
climate referred to was that of Assam, rather than England; but I
felt it was almost an act of filial piety to sign a full page
advertisement in the Times calling for a liberalisation of the
laws on pot...&quot; When it became obvious that there would be
no liberalisation, be attacked the government, his own party, in
the parliamentary debate. He said his father had told the IHDC
that when insane people were arrested a form had to be filled
saying why they were insane, and the safest thing to say was
ganja as the police knew that no further enquiry would be made.
When the government spokeswoman asked rhetorically &quot;What
sort of society will we create if everyone wants to escape from
reality 7&quot; Driberg answered that &quot;They want to escape
from this horrible society we have created.&quot; The 1968 Wooton
Committee on Cannabis was &quot;in agreement with the conclusions
reached by the IHDC... that the long-term consumption of cannabis
in moderate doses has no harmful effects.&quot; Given wide
publicity, the government couldn't completely to ignore this new
study; instead they did exactly the opposite of what it
recommended, and increased penalties for all cannabis offences in
a new 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Cannabis use continued to
increase dramatically. By 1990 there were 40,194 convictions and
cautions for cannabis in the UK, well over 90% of all recorded
drugs crimes.<br>

<p><font size="5">Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</font> </p>

<p><font size="5">CHAPTER IX</font> </p>

<p><font size="5">SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Scope of this Chapter.</b> </p>

<p>431. In the instructions issued to the Commission by the
Government of India, reference is made to the use of hemp drugs
among fakirs and ascetics who are held in veneration by large
classes of the people, and to the custom, which is believed to
obtain to a large extent in Bengal, of offering an infusion of
bhang to every guest and member of the family on the last day of
the Durga Puja. The Commission were instructed to ascertain to
what extent these and similar customs prevail in Bengal and other
parts of India, and how far the use of hemp drugs forms a part of
social, or possibly religious, ceremonial or observance.
Questions 32 and 33 of the Commission's questions were intended
to elicit information on these points.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal.</b> </p>

<p>432. In Bengal there is a considerable body of evidence
dealing with these customs, and more particularly with the custom
of offering an infusion of bhang on the last day of the Durga<b> </b>Puja.
Some few witnesses, it is true, state either that no social or
religious custom with which hemp drugs are connected exists, or
that they are unaware of any such custom; but the great majority
of the witnesses either give an account of them more or less
full, or allude to them briefly as matters of common notoriety.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Durga Puja.</b> </p>

<p>433. The custom of offering an infusion of the leaves of the
hemp plant to every guest and member of the family on the Bijoya
Dasami, or last day of the Durga Puja, is common in Bengal, and
may almost be said to be universal. It is alluded to by many of
the witnesses who refer to its use on this occasion as well as on
other days of the Durga Puja festival. But, while there can be no
doubt as to the existence of the custom, there is considerable
divergence of opinion as to the true nature of it. The custom
itself is a simple one. On the last day of this great festival
the male members of the family go forth to consign the image to
the waters and on their return the whole family with their guests
exchange greetings and embrace one another. During this rejoicing
a cup containing an infusion of the leaves of the hemp plant is
handed round, and all are expected to partake thereof, or at
least to place it to the lips in token of acceptance. Sweetmeats
containing hemp are also distributed. Opinion is almost equally
divided as to whether the custom is a mere social observance, or
whether it is an essential part of the religious ceremonial of
the festival. There is difference whether there is any injunction
in theof opinion among the witnesses as to <i>Shastras </i>rendering
obligatory the consumption of hemp; but Tantric religious works
sanction the use, and the custom whatever be its origin may now
be said from immemorial usage to be regarded by many people as
part of their religious observances. From the evidence of the
witnesses it would appear that there is no specific direction in
the <i>Shastras </i>of the manner in which the drug should be
used but from the references quoted it would appear that the use
alluded to is authority that of bhang in <i>the </i>form of an
infusion. Witnesses who can speak Mahamahon hopadhya Mahesa
Chandra Nyayaratna, C.I<font face="Courier New"> <font size="2"><tt>on
the subject, such as </font></tt></font><font size="4">Principal
of the Government Sanskrit College, Calcutta, testify to
religious sanction for the use of bhang or siddhi, while many
witnesses of high social position, well acquainted with the
habits of the people, as, for example, Maharaja Sir Jotindra
Mohain Tagore, K.C.S.I., Maharaja Durga Charan Law, Raja Piari
Mohan Mukharji, C.S.I., Rai Rajkumar Sarvadhikari Bahadur, Rai
Bahadur Kanai Lall . Day, C.I.E., and others, speak to the
prevalence of the custom, its intimate association with the
religious devotions of the people, and the innocent harmlessness
of the practice.<br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Other occasions on which bhang is used.</b> </p>

<p>434. The custom described above, and which refers solely to
bhang as distinguished from other preparations of the hemp plant,
is he most important occasion on which bhang is used as a part of
social or religious ceremonies; but there is evidence to show
that the drug in this form is used at other festivals. For
example, at the Holi festival, which is observed more generally
in Behar than in other parts of the Lower Provinces, bhang is
commonly consumed; and, according to many witnesses, at such
festivals as the Diwali, Chait Sankranti, Pous Sankranti,
Sripanchami, Sivachaturdasi, Ramnavami, and indeed on occasions
of weddings and many other family festivities. But, so far as the
evidence shows, the use on those occasions is a matter of social
custom observed more generally in some parts of the province than
in others, and, although nodoubt there may be some who consider
it essential to their devotions, partaking but little of the
nature of general religious observance. In Orissa bhang is
largely used by the attendants and worshippers at the temple of
Jagannath at Puri; and there appears also to exist a custom,
somewhat similar to that of the Durga Puja in Bengal, of offering
siddhi or bhang in the form of sweetmeats to the god Ganesh,
which are then eaten by the worshippers and their friends and
relatives. This festival, called the Ganesh Chaturthi, occurs in
the month of Bhadro (August-September).<br>
</p>

<p><b>Connection of ganja with the worship of Siva.</b> </p>

<p>435. It is chiefly in connection with the worship of Siva, the
Mahadeo or great god of the Hindu trinity, that the hemp plant,
and more especially perhaps ganja, is associated. The hemp plant
is popularly believed to have been a great favourite of Siva, and
there is a great deal of evidence before the Commission to show
that the drug in some form or other is now extensively used in
the exercise of the religious practices connected with this form
of worship. Reference to the almost universal use of hemp drugs
by fakirs, jogis, sanyasis, and ascetics of all classes, and more
particularly of those devoted to the worship of Siva, will be
found in the paragraphs of this report dealing with the classes
of the people who consume the drugs. These religious ascetics,
who are regarded with great veneration by the people at large,
believe that the hemp plant is a special attribute of the god
Siva, and this belief is largely shared by the people. Hence the
of many fond epithets ascribing to ganja the significance of a
divine pro-party, and the common practice of invoking the deity
in terms of adoration before placing the <i>chillum </i>or pipe
of ganja to the lips. There is evidence to show that on almost
all occasions of the worship of this god, the hemp drugs in some
form or other are used by certain classes of the people it is
established by the evidence of Mahamabopadhya Mahesa Chandra
Nyayaratna and of other witnesses that siddhi is offered to the
image of Siva at Benares, Baldynath, Tarakeswar, and elsewhere.
At the Shivratri festival, and on almost all occasions before the
on which this worship is practised, there is abundant evidence
Commission which shows not only that ganja is offered to the god
and consumed by these classes of the worshippers, but that these
customs are so intimately connected with their worship that they
may be considered to form in some sense an integral part of it.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinath.</b> </p>

<p>436. The special form of worship by the followers of Siva,
called the Trinath or Tinnath Mela, in which the use of ganja is
considered to be essential, is mentioned by many witnesses, and
deserves more than a passing notice. A full account of this
religious practice given by Babu Abhilas Chandra Mukharji will be
found in Vol. III Appendices of this Report. The origin of the
rite, which it is said sprang up first in Eastern Bengal, appears
to be of recent date, about the year 1867. It appears to be
observed at all times and at all seasons by Hindus and
Muhammadans alike, the latter calling it Tinlakh Pir. When an
object of special desire is fulfilled, or when a person recovers
from illness, or a son is born, or a marriage or other ceremony
is performed, the god Trinath, representing in one the Hindu
trinity, is worshipped. Originally one pice worth of ganja, one
pice worth of oil, and one pice worth of betel-nut was offered to
the god. But now ganja--it may be in large quantities--is
proffered, and during the incantations and the performance of the
ritual it is incumbent on all present to smoke. This form of
worship is shown to have spread extensively throughout Eastern
Bengal and the Surma Valley of Assam, and, according to one
witness, it has penetrated. even to Orissa. On the other hand,
there are a few witnesses who say that the practice is gradually
dying out. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Muhamadans</b> </p>

<p>437. The use of hemp drugs is as a rule in no way connected
with orthodox Muhammadan observances, whether social or
religious. The Muhammadan religion condemns such practices.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Assam..</b> </p>

<p>438. In Assam, where the use of hemp drugs is but little
practised by the Assamese proper, there appear to be no
indigenous customs connected with the drugs. But the customs
prevailing in Bengal are also found in Assam. There is evidence
as to the use of bhang or siddhi at the Durga Puja, and of ganja
by the worshippers of Siva. In Sylhet the Trinath form of worship
appears to prevail to a considerable extent. With reference to
this practice, one witness (Prasanno Kumar Das) observes that
&quot;in<i> </i>the Surma Valley ganja is offered in the name of
Pit Muhammadan saint) for the benefit of the cattle.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>439. In the North-Western Provinces, where the celebration of
the Durga Puja is not so generally observed as in Bengal, a
con-siderable number of witnesses (some fifty in all) state that
there are no customs, religious or social, with which these drugs
are connected. But, on the other hand, there is overwhelming
evidence to establish the almost universal use by the people of
bhang at the Holi festival, and some evidence as to the common
use of ganja by certain classes of the followers of Siva at their
festivals and seasons of worship. Of the witnesses who speak to
the use of ganja in connection with religious observances, 22
state that it is essential and 92 that it is not essential. As to
whether the use of bhang should be regarded as a purely social
custom or as essential to religious observance,. the opinion of
witnesses who speak on the point is about equally divided. It is
sufficient to say that the custom is now a general one, and that
where the Holi festival is observed, there the practice of
consuming bhang during its observance is common. On other
occasions, such as the Diwali festival, marriages, and family
festivities, there is evidence to show that among certain classes
the consumption of bhang is common. Allusion is also frequently
made to the habit of using bhang, to which, for example, the
Chaubes of Mathra and Brindaban are notoriously addicted, but how
far the habit is connected with the religious observances at the
temples the evidence does not justify the formation of an
opinion. A custom is mentioned by, a Kumaon witness, Dharma Nand
Joshi, who states that a class of people called Ko<i>uls, </i>who
worship spirits, meat, fish, etc., have the bhang plant as one of
the objects of their worship.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Punnjab</b> </p>

<p>440. In the Punjab there is evidence as to the general use of
hemp by some of the followers of Siva, and especially of bhang,
at the Holi, Dasehra, Diwali, and other festivals, and on the
occasion o marriages and other family festivities. Among the
Sikhs the use of bhang as a beverage appears to be common, and to
be associated with their religious practices. The witnesses who
refer to this use by the Sikhs appear to regard it as an
essential part of their religious rites having the authority of
the Granth or Sikh scripture. Witness Sodhi Iswar Singh, Extra
Assistant Commissioner, says :&quot;As far as I know, bhang is
pounded by the Sikhs on the Dasehra day, and it is ordinarily
binding upon every Sikh to drink it as a sacred draught by mixing
water with it. <i>Legend--</i>Guru<i> </i>Gobind Singh, the tenth
guru, the founder of the Sikh religion, was on the gaddi of Baba
Nanak in the time of Emperor Aurangzeb. When the guru was at
Anandpur, tahsil Una, Hoshiarpur district, engaged in battle with
the Hill Rajas of the Simla, Kangra, and the Hoshiarpur
districts, the Rains sent an elephant, who was trained in
attacking and slaying the forces of the enemy with a sword in his
trunk and in breaking open the gates of forts, to attack and
capture the Lohgarh fort near Anandpur. The guru gave one of his
followers, Bachittar Singh, some bhang and a little of opium to
eat, and directed him to face the said elephant. This brave man
obeyed the word of command of his leader and attacked the
elephant, who was intoxicated and had achieved victories in
several battles before, with the result that the animal was
overpowered and the Hill Rajas defeated. The use of bhang,
therefore, on the Dasehra day is necessary as a sacred draught.
It is customary among the Sikhs generally to drink bhang, so that
Guru Gobind Singh has himself said the following poems in praise
of bhang: &quot;Give me, O Saki (butler), a cup of green colour
(bhang), as it is required by me at the time of battle (vide
'Suraj Parkash,' the Sikh religious book). &quot;Bhang is also
used on the Chandas day, which is a festival of the god Sheoji
Mahadeva. The Sikhs consider it binding to use it on the Dasehra
day-The quantity then taken is too small to prove
injurious.&quot; As Sikhs are absolutely prohibited by their
religion from smoking, the use of ganja and charas in this form
is not practised by them. of old Sikh times, is annually
permitted to collect without interference a boat load of bhang,
which is afterwards. distributed throughout the year to the
sadhus and beggars who are supported by the dharamsala. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Central Provinces.</b> </p>

<p>441. The evidence as to social or religious customs in the
Central Provinces is somewhat discrepant, but on the whole points
to the existence of customs akin to those existing in the
North-Western Provinces. The use of bhang at the Holi and Diwali
festivals and at marriages and such occasions, and of ganja or
bhang in connection with. the worship of Siva, is frequently
mentioned by the witnesses. A few local customs are also
mentioned by some witnesses. Regarding a custom of the Chamar
caste, the Rev. Mr. Jacob says: &quot;At Chanda; the Chamars use
ganja dust in the preparation of a beverage called <i>gulabpani, </i>which
is drunk at a ceremony called <i>dadhi </i>(the first shaving of
the beard), when no liquor is permitted.&quot; Among the Gonds,
Cowasjee Nusserwanjee Hattidaru describes the following custom as
existing:.&quot; In the funeral ceremony amongst the Gonds of
these provinces, <i>kalli </i>or flat ganja is placed over the
chest of the dead body of the Gond, and when the funeral party
returns home, a little of the ganja is burnt in the house of the
dead person, the smoke of which is supposed to reach the spirit
of the dead.&quot; Another Satpura witness, Hosen Khan, mentions
a custom of offering &quot;a<i> </i>little ganja at the Chitarai
Debis, or collections of stones with rags tied to some tree
above. They offer either a cock or a cocoanut or some ganja. It
is a custom among travellers. These Chitarai Debis are in the
open, and the travellers have a smoke at the same time.&quot; One
witness states that he has heard of the hemp plant being
worshipped in the Berars, but this is not corroborated by any of
the witnesses from these districts. Another has heard that the
Gonds in their hill homes are worshippers of the plant<br>
</p>

<p><b>Madras.</b> </p>

<p>442. In the Madras Presidency, where the use of hemp drugs is
less common than in most other provinces, many witnesses assert
that there are no customs, social or religious, with which they
are connected, and the evidence as a whole fails to establish the
prevalence of any customs so general as those connected with the
Durga Puja and the worship of Siva in Bengal or the Holi festival
in the North-Western Provinces. But there is evidence as to the
existence of customs of a less general or widespread nature. In
Ganjam, the witnesses speak to the common use bhang on the <i>Mesha
Sankranti </i>day in honour of Siva and Anjanayya, and also in
the worship of Durga. Several also allude to a custom of offering
a confection or draught containing bhang to the image at the
temples of Hanuman. At the festival of Kama, the Indian cupid,
bhang is freely made and drunk according to several witnesses.
The Rajputs or Bondilis are particularly referred to in
connection with this custom. On occasions of holidays or
gala-days, and at the Mohurram, a number of witnesses say it is
usual for Muhammadans as well as Hindus to take bhang. It is also
said that various intoxicants, including ganja, are sometimes
offered to the gods in worship, and then swallowed by those
offering them. Witness M. Sundaram Iyer, Deputy Tahsildar (60),
says: &quot;Some<i> </i>of the lower orders make use of ganja as
an offering, like cocoa-nut, plantains, liquor, and such other
articles, for certain deities, such as Mathura--veeran,
Muniappan, etc., according to the vow taken by each person. This
cannot be considered as essential, but is only a practice
observed in very rare cases. Such practice is not followed by
many people, and it is not injurious. &quot;Others allude to the
offering of ganja to Karuppannam, Kali, Mathuraveeran, Muniappan,
Karuannaswami, and Aiyaswami, more particularly in the south of
the Presidency. Mr. Azizuddin, Sahib Bahadur, Deputy Collector,
says: &quot;Neither<i> </i>the Musalman nor the Hindu religion
requires the use of these drugs on religious occasions. On the
other hand, it is prohibited. Nevertheless, in the <i>maths </i>of
bairagis, such as at Tripati, and of Muhammadan saints, such as
at Nagore Conjeveram, Arcot, and other places, the manager of the
shrine distributes ganja to all the fakirs who assemble during
the festival. In none of these places, religiously speaking,
ganja should be distributed, but, according to custom among the
fakirs, its distribution is essential.&quot; The Rev. Mr.
Campbell says that ganja is used in connection with the funeral
ceremonies observed by certain classes, but that the use is not
essential. Mr. Merriman alludes to a custom of offering and
consuming bhang at the funeral of bhang consumers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Bombay</b> </p>

<p>443. An interesting note, entitled &quot;The Religion of
Hemp,&quot; by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.I.E., will be found in Vol.
III Appendices. In the Bombay presidency the use of hemp in
connection with the worship of Siva, Mahadev or Shankar appears
to be very common. It is referred to by many witnesses. The
following description of this custom as prevailing in part of
Gujarat, Kaira, and probably Ahmedabad has been furnished to the
Excise Commissioner by Mr. B. E. Modi, Deputy Collector: &quot;On<i>
</i>the Shivratri day (the last day but one of the month of
Magh), sacred to the god Mahadev or Shankar, bhang water is
freely poured over the <i>lingam. </i>Mahadev is an ascetic, and
is fond of bhang, and on this day it is considered a religious
duty to offer him his favourite drink. From this day to the 11th
day of Ashad, on which day gods go to sleep, water is kept
constantly dripping upon the <i>lingam </i>of Mahadev from an
earthen pot kept above it. &quot;Somewhat similar accounts
varying in detail are given by many witnesses coming from
different parts of the province, of whom some also refer to the
habit which ganja smokers have of invoking the deity before
placing the pipe. to their lips. Others also refer to hemp as
required in the worship of Baldeo and to its use at the Shimga or
Holi festival. The Marwaris and some other classes appear to use
bhang at marriages and other festivities. Mr. Charles, Collector
of Belgaum, says that among Musalmans and Marathas the ganja
plant is offered to dead relatives who used it in their lifetime
at the time of the anniversary ceremonies of their death. There
appears to be no special custom of worshipping the hemp plant
itself. R. K. Kothavale, of Satara district, says the hemp plant
is worshipped, by one sect only, namely, by people from Northern
India and Nepal, while Mr. Lamb, Collector of Alibag, remarks
that some of the Kunbis who make Offerings to the local
divinities of their fields at the harvest season include a. small
quantity of ganja in the offerings.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Sind.</b> </p>

<p>444. In Sind the customs, both religious and' social, appear
to be much the same as in Bombay. In Karachi and some other
places bhang is generally offered to all comers on occasions of
marriages, panchayats, and other gatherings; and the custom of
freely distributing bhang as a charity to all who dare to partake
is common both at temples and at other places of resort.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Berar.</b> </p>

<p>445. In Berar there is evidence as to the use both of ganja
and bhang at the Shivratri and Holi festivals and at social
gatherings. The hemp plant itself is not worshipped, but,
according to one witness, when a consumer dies, the plant is kept
near his corpse during the funeral ceremony. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Ajmere-Merwara.</b> </p>

<p>446. At the Holi and the Shivratri and at family festivities
the drugs, especially bhang, are used. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Baluchistan.</b> </p>

<p>447. Major Gaisford, Deputy Commissioner, states that among
the Hindu sect called Barn Bargis the consumption of bhang is
regarded as essential.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Native States.</b> </p>

<p>448. From Native States there is but little information
regarding customs, either social or religious, with which these
drugs are connected. No purely local or indigenous customs have
been brought to the notice of the Commission, but there is
sufficient information to show that practices similar to those
existing in British provinces at the Holi and Shrivratri
festivals and on occasions of family rejoicings are observed by
certain classes of the people in many Native States.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Worship of the hemp plant</b> </p>

<p>449. The custom of worshipping the hemp plant, although not so
prevalent as that of offering hemp to Siva and other deities of
the Hindus, would nevertheless appear from the statements of the
witnesses to exist to some extent in some provinces of India. The
reason why this fact is not generally known may perhaps be
gathered from such statements as that of Pandit Dharma Nand
Joshi, who says that such worship is performed in secret. There
may be another cause of the denial on the part of the large
majority of Hindu witnesses of any knowledge of the existence of
a custom of worshipping the hemp plant in that the educated Hindu
will not admit that he worships the material object of his
adoration, but the deity as represented by it. The custom of
worshipping the hemp plant, though not confined to the Himalayan
districts or the northern portions of India alone, where the use
of the products of the hemp plant is more general among the
people, is less known as we go south. Still even far south, in
some of the hilly districts of the Madras Presidency and among
the rural population, the hemp plant is looked upon with some
sort of veneration. Mr. J. H. Merriman (witness No. 28, Madras)
says: <i>&quot;I </i>know of no custom of worshipping the hemp
plant, but believe it is held in a certain sort of veneration by
some classes.&quot; Mr. J. Sturrock, the Collector of Coimbatore
(witness No. 2, Madras), says: &quot;In some few localities there
is a tradition of sanctity attached to the plant, but no regular
worship. &quot;The Chairman of the Conjeveram Municipal Board,
Mr. E. Subramana Iyer (witness No. 143, Madras) says: &quot;There
is no plant to be worshipped here, but it is generally used as
sacrifices to some of the minor Hindu deities. &quot;There is a
passage quoted from <i>Rudrayanmal Danakand and Karmakaud </i>in
the report on the use of hemp drugs in the Baroda State, which
also shows that the worship of the bhang plant is enjoined in the
<i>Shastras. </i>It is thus stated: &quot;The god Shiva says to
Parvati-- 'Oh,<i> </i>goddess Parvati, hear the benefits derived
from bhang. The worship of bhang raises one to my position. In <i>Bhabishya
Puran </i>it is stated that &quot;on the 13th moon of Chaitra
(March and April) one who wishes to see the number of his sons
and grandsons increased must worship <i>Kama </i>(Cupid) in the
hemp plant, etc.&quot;.<br>
</p>

<p><b>General conclusions</b> </p>

<ol>
    <li>In summing up their conclusions on this chapter, the
        Commission would first remark that charas, which is a
        comparatively new article of consumption, has not been
        shown to be in any way connected with religious
        observance. As regards Northern India, the Commission are
        of opinion that the use of bhang is more or less common
        everywhere in connection with the social and religious
        customs of the people As regards ganja they find that
        there are certain classes in all parts, except the
        Punjab, who use the drug in connection with their social
        and religious observances. The Commission are also of
        opinion in regard to bhang that its use is considered
        essential in some religious observances by a large
        section of the community, and in regard to ganja that
        those who consider it essential are comparatively very
        few. The Commission have little doubt that interference
        with the use of hemp in connection with the customs and
        observances above referred to would be regarded by the
        consumers as an interference with long established usage
        and as an encroachment upon their religious liberty. And
        this feeling would, especially in the case of bhang,
        undoubtedly be shared to some extent by the people at
        large. Regarding Southern India, the same remarks apply
        with this reservation, that. the difference between ganja
        and bhang as materials for smoking and drinking
        respectively is much less marked there, and the
        distinction between the two forms of the drug is much
        less clearly recognised, although by the term<i> </i>&quot;bhang&quot;
        is generally meant the drug as used for drinking, and by
        &quot;ganja&quot;<i> </i>the drug as used for smoking. </li>

<hr>

<p><b>General principles regarding sumptuary laws and their
application to India.</b> </p>

<p>553. The question of prohibiting the growth of the hemp plant
and the sale of ganja and allied drugs is one which stands in the
to forefront Of the present inquiry. It has been remarked by a
well known historian that &quot;no<i> </i>laws are of any service
which are above the working level of public morality, and the
deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the
opportunities of evasion. If these words are true as applied to
England under a feudal system, they are much more true in the
present day as applied to British India. The Government of this
country has not grown out of the forces contained within it, but
has been superimposed upon them, and the paternal system of
government which may have been suitable in England during the
sixteenth century, and in, the initial development of some Indian
provinces during the period immediately following their
annexation, becomes purely visionary when public opinion is in
process of formation and the needs of the people are year by year
finding more ready expression. Occasionally, no doubt, the
Legislature in India has anticipated a standard of morality not
universally accepted by the people, as in the case of laws
relating to infanticide or the burning of Hindu widows; but these
measures were passed under an overwhelming sense of the necessity
of correcting popular notions of morality in matters coming well
within the sphere of Government, and in the assurance that in the
course of time they could not fail to secure the assent of all
intelligent members of the community. In the chapter of Mill's
Political Economy which treats of the non-interference principle,
a distinction is made between two kinds of intervention by the
Government-- the one authoritative interference, and the other
giving advice or promulgating information. And the following
remarks are made regarding the former: </p>

<p>&quot;It is evident, even at first sight, that the
authoritative form of Government intervention has a much more
limited sphere of legitimate action than the other. It requires a
much stronger necessity to justify it in any case, while there
are large departments of human life from which it must be
unreservedly and imperiously excluded. Whatever theory we adopt
respecting the foundation of the social union, and under whatever
political institutions we live, there is a circle around every
individual human being which no Government, be it that of one, or
of few, or of the many, ought to be permitted to overstep there
is a part of the life of every person who has come to years of
discretion within which the individuality of that person ought to
reign uncontrolled either by any other individual or by the
public collectively. That there is, or ought to be, some space in
human existence thus entrenched around no one who professes the
smallest regard to human freedom or dignity will call in
question: the point to be determined is where the limit should be
placed; how large a province of human life this reserved
territory should include. I apprehend that it ought to include
all that part which concerns only the life, whether inward or
outward of the individual, and does not affect. the interests of
Others, or affect. them only through the moral influence of
example. With respect to the domain of the inward consciousness,
the thoughts and feelings, and as much of external conduct as is
personal only, involving no consequences, none at least of a
painful or injurious kind, to other people, I hold that it is
allowable in all, and in the more thoughtful and cultivated often
a duty, to assert and promulgate with all the force they are
capable of their opinion of what is good or bad, admirable or
contemptible, but not to compel others to conform to that
opinion, whether the force used is that of extra legal coercion,
or exerts itself by means of the law. Even in those portions of
conduct which do affect the interests of others, the onus of
making out a case always lies on the defenders of legal
prohibitions.<i> </i>It is not merely a constructive or
presumptive injury to others which will justify the interference
of law with individual freedom. To be prevented from what one is
inclined to, or from acting contrary to one's own judgment of
what is desirable, is not only always irksome, but always tends, <i>pro
tanto, </i>to starve the development of some portion of the
bodily or mental faculties, either sensitive or active; and,
unless the conscience of the individual goes freely with the
legal restraint, it partakes, either in a great or in a small
degree, of the degradation of slavery. Scarcely any degree of
utility short of absolute necessity will justify a prohibitory
regulation, unless it can also be made to recommend itself to the
general conscience; unless persons of ordinary good intentions
either believe already, or can be induced to believe, that the
thing prohibited is a thing which they ought not to wish to
do.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>These remarks have been given at length, because the
Commission believe that they contain a clear exposition of the
principles which should guide them in deciding whether the
prohibition of the hemp drugs should be authoritatively enforced
by Government. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The question of entirely suppressing all intoxicants.</b> </p>

<p>554- Now, a certain number of .persons (among whom may in all
probability,- be reckoned the mover of the question in the, House
of Commons which led to the appointment of the-Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission) deem it to be the duty of the British Government to
suppress the trade in all intoxicants in all the countries under
its sway; and there are no doubt special circumstances<i> </i>in
India which render it less, impossible than in some other
countries to consider even so drastic a policy. These are notably
the general sobriety of its races and the feeling, popular as
well as religious, which prevails against their use among a large
section of the community. Even then no appeal in support of such
a measure can be made to the public morality <font
face="Courier New"><font size="4"><tt>or </tt></font>practice of
civilised nations at large, nor, so far as the Commission are
aware, to any marked success attending the experiment in
particular instances. In the exceptional cases in which the
experiment has been attended with partial success (as in some of
the American States), the reformation of the habit has become an
object of desire to the majority of the people, and the enactment
for promoting Such reformation has presented itself less as a
restrictive force than as an auxiliary agency <br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Not laid before the commission</b> </p>

<p>555. But the Commission are not called upon to pronounce on so
wide an issue. It was not upon the basis of this general
principle that the Secretary of State for India accepted the
proposal made in the House of Commons, nor do the instructions
issued to the Commission by the Government of India cover so wide
a field. The question of prohibiting the production and sale of
the hemp drugs in India has to be considered by the Commission
apart from the general question, and such prohibition must be
justified, if at all, on some more special ground than the mere
fact that they are intoxicants.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The past history of the case how far to be relied upon.</b>
</p>

<p>556. Again, there are a certain number of persons whose'
evidence before the Commission points to the assumption that the
case for prohibition of the hemp drugs has already been
established in the records of the Government, and that further
enquiry implies a willful blindness to what has been abundantly
proved by such records. A reference to Chapter XII of this Report
will show how untrustworthy these records are in regard to the
production of insanity by the use of the drugs-- an aspect of the
question which is of the utmost importance, and has formed the
basis of nearly all the official opinion heretofore recorded.
against such use. And, after availing themselves fully of every
opportunity of consulting the official literature on the subject,
the Commission have arrived at the conclusion that it shows
little originality, and that a very limited amount of personal
observation has been made to do duty as the basis of large
conclusions. The want of reliable data has been compensated by
annual reiteration until the stamp of antiquity has secured for
the opinions so expressed a large amount of acquiescence among
officials who had neither the time nor the opportunity to examine
the matter for themselves So far, therefore, as the effects of
the hemp drugs are concerned, the Commission have had to approach
the subject as almost a <i>tabula rasa, </i>and, while availing
themselves of the imperfect data previously collected, have
endeavoured to avoid accepting any conclusions without a
substantial foundation of well ascertained facts. The attitude,
however, of the Government in regard to the question may be
briefly described. So far back as 1798 an inquiry was made in
Bengal regarding the quality of ten intoxicating articles--
&quot;opium, madak ganja, subzi, bhang, majum, banker, charas,
tobacco, and toddy--&quot; with a view to determining whether it
might not be advisable to prohibit altogether the sale of any of
them. The conclusion arrived at, which was stated in a letter of
the Board to the Governor-General in Council, No. 22, dated 29th
May 1798, was to the following effect. &quot;It appears that the
original productions are as follows: Tobacco, opium, ganja, subzi
or bhang, banker, and toddy, and that the three remaining
articles are for the most part compositions of those here
recited, as above mentioned. With respect to the drugs specified
m the foregoing schedule, they are not for the most part
represented as producing any very violent or dangerous effects of
intoxication except when taken to excess; and, although the
operation of them-may be more powerful in their compound state,
we apprehend it would be difficult to sanction the sale of the
original productions, and to prohibit with effect the use of
compositions of which they are susceptible; to which may be added
that most of these articles, both as original productions and as
artificial combinations appear to be useful either in medicine or
otherwise; for these reasons we do not deem it necessary to
recommend that the sale of any of them be altogether prohibited,
but shall proceed to state what appear to us the. best means of
restraining the use of them, and improving the revenue by the
imposition of such taxes as are best adapted to the nature of the
case.&quot; A complete inquiry was made in 1871 from all
provinces as to the effects of several preparations of hemp; and
if the result should call for any action in the direction of
restricting them by enhancement of the duty or of limiting, or
even prohibiting, the cultivation of the. plant, the advice of
the Local Governments was invited as to the expediency and
practicability of such measures. The result is contained in the
Resolution of the Government of. India, Finance Department, No.
3773, dated 17th December 1873. The following passage shows the
conclusion arrived at: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Upon a consideration of all the opinions thus collected,
it does not appear to the Governor-General in Council to be
specially proved that hemp incites to crime more than other drugs
or than spirits. And there is some evidence to show that on rare
occasions this drug, usually so noxious, may be usefully taken.
There can, however, be no doubt that its habitual use does
produce insanity. The total number of cases of insanity is small
in proportion to the population, and not large even in proportion
to the number of ganja smokers; but of the cases of insanity
produced by the excessive use of drugs or spirits, by far the
largest number must be attributed to the abuse of hemp. Lower
Bengal the circumstances have admitted of a system under which
the consumption of ganja has been reduced one-half, while the
amount of duty levied on it has been doubled. It would be very
desirable to control the cultivation and preparation of ganja and
bhang elsewhere-in the same way. But it is believed that this
would not be easy; indeed, it would probably be impracticable.
Moreover, with the exception of the Chief Commissioners of
British Burma and the Central Provinces, the Local Governments
are not in favour of altering existing arrangements. His
Excellency in Council, however, trusts that the various Local
Governments and Administrations will endeavour, wherever it may
be possible, to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang by
placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation and
retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can
be levied without inducing illicit practices. As regards British
Burma, the Chief Commissioner has already been informed that the
Governor-General in Council concurs with him in thinking that the
cultivation and consumption of ganja should be absolutely
prohibited, and it has been prohibited from the beginning of the
year 1873-74. &quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In 1877 the Bengal Government appointed a special officer,
Babu Hem Chunder Kerr, to make a full inquiry into the details of
the cultivation of ganja, the sufficiency or otherwise of the
present safeguards, and the reforms which it might be advisable
to introduce. Sir Ashley Eden's conclusions on this officer's
report in regard to the effects of ganja and policy to be
followed were as follows: &quot;The Lieutenant-Governor has
himself no doubt that the use of ganja in any form is injurious
to the consumer, and that it is the duty of Government to make
the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear.
Unfortunately it is habitually used by large numbers of the lower
classes of the population, who would, if deprived of it
altogether, apparently find in the leaves of the wild hemp plant
and in other drugs narcotics and stimulants of equally
deleterious character. It does not seem possible, therefore, to
stop the cultivation altogether. The policy of Government must be
to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without
placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will
insist upon having it.&quot; The last important utterance on the
subject previous to the appointment of the Commission is
contained in the letter of the Government of India, Finance
Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, No. 212, dated
9th August 1892, in which the following remarks occur: &quot;We
are inclined to believe that ganja is the most noxious of all
intoxicants now commonly used in India. But even if the absolute
prohibition of the use of the drug could be enforced, the result
might be to induce the use of still more noxious drugs. India
abounds with plants growing wild from which drugs can be procured
which are more deleterious in their effects than ganja. One such<i>
</i>plant is the dhatura <i>(Stramonium), </i>the seeds of which
are already used to intensify the narcotic effects of bhang, a
liquid preparation of hemp leaves; and we apprehend that if the
use of ganja were suppressed altogether, dhatura might be largely
resorted to by the poorer classes as a means of satisfying their
craving for stimulants. Apart, however, from the objections just
mentioned, we believe. that it would be impossible to enforce in
India a prohibition of the use of ganja. That drug is produced in
Native States, and the difficulties in the way of preventing its
import from them, if the supply in British India were cut off,
would be immense. It would not, moreover, be possible to suppress
the supply in British India. The hemp plant grows readily in
India, in many places wild without cultivation of any kind, and
it would be easy for any one addicted to the use of ganja to grow
a plant or two in the enclosure of his own house and in nooks and
corners which would be safe from observation and from the risk of
detection. The question in the House of Commons suggests that as
the possession and sale of ganja has been prohibited for many
years in Burma, it is desirable that the same prohibition should
be extended to other provinces of British India. The analogy of
Burma does not, however, apply to India. When the prohibition was
enforced in Burma, the drug was very little used by the Native
Burmese, its consumption being almost entirely confined to
coolies and other immigrants from India; and the cultivation of
the plant in Burma, which had never been extensive, had virtually
ceased, the consumers being dependent on importations for their
supplies. In India, on the other hand, the practice of ganja
smoking has existed from time immemorial, and among certain sects
of Hindus, ascetics, and religious mendicants hemp intoxication
is habitually indulged in; and, as explained in the preceding
paragraph, it would be impossible to suppress the growth of the
plant. But, although we consider it impracticable to enforce the
absolute prohibition of the use of ganja, we fully recognise it
as our duty to restrict its consumption as far as practicable,
and we have distinctly laid down the policy to be pursued in
respect of this drug in our Resolution of the 17th December 1873
already quoted. The annual reports of Excise Administration show
that the subject has since been continually before Local
Governments, who are making every possible endeavour to minimise
the evils and discourage the use of the drug wherever it is a
source of danger to consumers.&quot; Thus &quot;restraining the
use and improving, the revenue by the imposition of suitable
taxation,&quot; &quot;discouraging<i> </i>the consumption by
placing restrictions on the cultivation, preparation, and retail,
and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied
without inducing illicit practices,&quot; &quot;limiting the
production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the
drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon
having it,&quot;<i> </i>&quot;restricting consumption as far as
practicable, minimising the evils, and discouraging the use of
the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers&quot;
have from time to time been the watch-words of the Government in
the matter of the hemp drugs, a policy only once definitely
abandoned, <i>viz., </i>in the case of Burma, where total
prohibition was introduced in 1873. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition in other countries.</b> </p>

<p>557. Allusion must be made to precedents for the prohibition
of the hemp drugs in other countries in order to complete these
general observations. Excepting British Burma (reference to which
will be made further on), the Commission only know of four cases
of prohibition, <i>viz., </i>in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and
Trinidad. For the first three of these, the only information at
the disposal of the Commission is contained in the communications
from Her Majesty's representatives addressed to the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs in 1892 in consequence of a requisition
made on them by the Earl of Rosebery at the request of Mr. W S
Caine, M.P.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Turkey</b> </p>

<p>558. The ground of the prohibition in Turkey is thus stated in
a note addressed by the Grand Vizir to the Ministry Commerce,
Constantinople, on 1st March 1292 <i>(sic)</i>:&quot;From<i> </i>the
reports furnished by the Imperial Medical Council, it appeared
that the use of hashish in the preparation of medicines was
extremely rare, and that, being a narcotic, its use must of
necessity be injurious, and that consequently the suppression of
the cultivation of hashish could not fail to prove highly
advantageous.&quot; The effect of the prohibition is thus
described in an enclosure to the Ambassador's reply: &quot;The
importation and sale in Turkey of hashish, though contraband, is
still, I hear, largely carried on, and is used for smoking, in
the composition of various sweetmeats, and as an opiate in
general.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Egypt.</b> </p>

<p>559. In Egypt the cultivation, use, and importation of hashish
were first forbidden in 1868, but in 1874 it was allowed to be
imported on payment of duty. In November 1877 an order was
received from Constantinople that all hashish brought into Egypt
was to be seized and destroyed, and finally, in March 1879, the
importation and cultivation of hashish were prohibited by a
Khedivial decree. In March 1884 it was provided that confiscated
hashish should be sold by the Customs (for delivery abroad)
instead of being destroyed as formerly, and the proceeds of the
sale divided amongst the informers and officers who took part in
the seizure. &quot;This measure was rendered necessary,&quot;
says Mr. Caillard, the Director-General of the Customs, &quot;by<i>
</i>the absence of any fund from which rewards could be
distributed; while, on the other hand, the profits of smuggling
being very great, large sums were paid by the smugglers to insure
the silence or complicity of the Customs officers,
coastguards-men, and others. A considerable number of persons are
employed in the smuggling trade, many of them having subsistence.
Great ingenuity is displayed by the smugglers no other means of
and no sooner has one trick been discovered than another isin
this illicit trade, of the contrainvented. The great obstacle,
however, to the complete repression band trade is the refusal of
some of the European Governments to recognize the right of the
Egyptian Government to search suspected shops or warehouses, and
to punish the delinquents by fine as well as confiscation. In
view of the impossibility of suppressing the contraband trade in
hashish under the suggested to the Minister of Finance
circumstances described above, desirability of removing the
prohibition against the importation of the and I proposed to
collect a customs duty of P. T. 100 per kilogramme (<i>9s. 3d.</i>per
lb.), besides it license-tax on the sale of hashish. It has been
abundantly proved that the vice of hashish smoking cannot be
suppressed by legislation, whereas by a system of licenses it may
be kept under control to some extent. &quot;Mr. Caillard
estimates that the quantity of hashish consumed annually in Egypt
cannot be less than 50,000 okes (about lbs. 140,000)
notwithstanding the prohibition. He states that the hashish
appears to be manufactured chiefly in Greece. </p>

<p><b>Greece.</b> </p>

<p>560. In Greece there is no law regulating or specially
alluding to the product as merchandise is allowed, but a Police
order of 1891 prohibits its sale and consumption in the small
cafes of Athens and the Piroeus, in some of which, during the
previous ten or fifteen years apparently, the habit of using this
drug had been gradually introduced. The order was based upon a
report of the Sanitary Board at Athens, in which prominent
mention is made of the observations made in India by English
doctors, and the statistics of insanity in Bengal lunatic asylums
ascribed to the use of the hemp drugs are put forward as
justifying, repressive measures. The effect of the order passed
is not mentioned, sufficient time not having elapsed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinidad..</b> </p>

<p>561<i>. </i>As regards Trinidad, the Commission are not sure
that the hemp drugs are prohibited. The fact has been stated by
the Indian Immigrants Commission, Natal, 1885-87, and by Dr.
Thomas Ireland, Government Medical Officer, British Guiana, in a
paper published in the <i>Alienist and Neurologist, </i>St.
Louis, in October 1893. But,<i> </i>on the other hand,
Surgeon-Major Comins, lately on special duty in British and
Foreign Colonies and the Netherlands, in his Note on Emigration
from India to Trinidad, 1893, quotes a statement of the Protector
of Immigrants, who says that in the year 1885 an Ordinance was
passed requiring the payment of L100 per acre to obtain a license
to grow ganja, which had previously been grown in large
quantities. This practically put a stop to the growth and
consumption for several years, but immigrants who had left
Trinidad two years previous to the writing of his report had been
growing it in Venezuela, and several seizures had been made by
the Customs officers from persons endeavouring to introduce it
into Trinidad. The Protector adds: &quot;With<i> </i>a coast line
such as ours, adjacent to that of the Spanish Main, it will be
impossible to prevent its introduction into this colony if
immigrants who go there continue to grow it.&quot; Dr. Comins
himself says: &quot;I do not know what are the laws in force here
regarding the sale of opium and ganja.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Basis of prohibition and results in these countries</b>. </p>

<p>562.<i> </i>Thus in the case of other countries, where the use
of the drugs has been prohibited, the Commission do not find in
the literature available to them many arguments for prohibition.
In Turkey it rests upon the theory accepted by orthodox
Muhammadans that hashish <i>&quot;being </i>a narcotic its use
must of necessity be injurious,&quot; while in Egypt the
prohibition emanated from Turkey. In both these countries the
measure has by no means been attended with complete success. In
Greece the prohibition in the cafes of Athens is based largely
upon Indian experience, which the Commission have had cause in
great measure to recast. In Trinidad, if there has been
prohibition, it does not seem of late to have been effectual. It
must be added that the Commission have no scientific information
regarding the strength of the article of commerce called hashish,
and it may differ to some extent from the Indian products. From
the description of its manufacture even by the Mayor of
Orchomenus in Mantines in Arcadia, whence the Egyptian supply is
mainly derived, it appears to resemble more the charas of Yarkand
than the ganja or bhang of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Is prohibition in India justifiable, feasible, and
advisable?</b> </p>

<p>563. Starting, therefore, from the position that what is known
of the hemp drugs in the past is not sufficient to justify their
prohibition in India, and that for such a measure there must be
strong justification based on ascertained facts scientifically
and systematically examined, the first question for the
Commission to decide is whether such justification is to be found
in the evidence before them, and the second-whether, if this is
so, prohibition is feasible and advisable on other grounds. These
will now be considered. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of bhang</b> </p>

<p>564. The effects of the hemp drugs have been treated in
Chapters X to XIII of the Report; and as the first result of
these conclusions, the Commission are prepared to state that the
suppression of the use of bhang would be totally unjustifiable.
It is established to their satisfaction that this use is very
ancient, and that it has some religious tion among a large body
of Hindus; that it enters into their social customs; that it is
almost without exception harmless in moderation, and perhaps in
some cases beneficial; that the abuse of it is not so harmful as
the abuse of alcohol; that its suppression, involving the
extirpation of the wild hemp plant, would in some tracts be a
matter of great difficulty; that such a measure would be
extremely unpopular, and would give rise to widespread
discontent; and, finally, that, if successfully accomplished, it
would lead to the use of more hurtful stimulants. The Commission
deem it unnecessary to traverse the evidence further than has
been done in the preceding chapters of this report in support of
these propositions. It is almost unanimous in regard to them. The
utmost that is necessary in regard to this product is that it
should be brought under more effective control, and this matter
will be dealt with further on. But absolute prohibition is, in
the opinion of the Commission, entirely out of the question. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of ganja and charas</b> </p>

<p>565. Though it has been shown that as a rule ganja and charas
are used in moderation, and that the moderate use ordinarily.
does not cause appreciable injury, yet it has been established
that the excessive use of these forms of hemp drugs has been more
injurious than in the case of bhang. Whether they should be
prohibited or merely controlled is a question which might be
settled merely with reference to their ascertained effects. The
Commission consider that the effects are not such as to call for
prohibition, and on the general principles discussed in the
opening paragraphs of this chapter, such interference would be
unjustifiable. Nevertheless, it. seems advisable to refer to the
other evidence with a view to ascertaining the generally
prevailing views on the subject, and considering the grounds on
which prohibition is advocated or opposed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The evidence regarding prohibition of ganja and charas may
be considered together.</b> </p>

<p>566. In reviewing the evidence on these points, it will not be
necessary to draw a distinction between ganja and charas. The
effects of these two drugs have been shown to be similar, though
charas is <i>cateris paribus </i>the more potent. They are both
ordinarily smoked, though very occasionally used for eating and
drinking usually in the form of admixtures with other condiments
stated by Mr. Lyall (Bengal 1): &quot;Ganja<i> </i>and charas are
really one, and in time, if the question be scientifically
followed up, possibly charas will be the only form used.&quot;
The refuse of ganja is used in some provinces as bhang, but this
substance more nearly resembles bhang than ganja properly so
called. The ganja of the different provinces varies in quality.
But these distinctions cannot here be specially observed; it will
be sufficient to bear in mind that the opinions in Bengal, the
Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, and the smaller
Administrations relate to ganja; that those in the Punjab relate
to charas; and that those in the North-Western Provinces and Sind
relate to ganja and charass, both of which consumed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Supply of ganja and charas in its relation to prohibition.<font
face="Arial"></b><font size="4"> </font></font> </p>

<p>567. A few remarks, however, recapitulating the local
conditions of ganja and charas will not be out of place. Charas
is practically a foreign article. Small amounts are imported from
Nepal and Gwalior, but they may be left out of the account. The
bulk comes from Yarkand through the Himalayan passes, or to a
much smaller. degree from offer parts of Central Asia through the
routes on the frontier of Afghanistan. It would not be a very
difficult matter to stop these imports, though the co-operation
of the Kashmir Darbar would be necessary in regard to Yarkand
charas. It may, therefore, be accepted that the supply of charas
might be cut off without much difficulty, though, as this article
forms the principal import from Yarkand, the prohibition of
charas would paralyse, if not extinguish, the trade with this
country. In regard to ganja, the problem is more complex. Ganja
is regularly cultivated in Bengal, the Central Provinces, Madras,
Bombay, and Berar. In Bengal and the Central Provinces, the
cultivation of the hemp, plant for its production is under
complete control. In Berer cultivation is only permitted under
license. In the other tracts of British territory it is not
directly Controlled. Assuming that control is possible in these
tracts, it does not follow that it would be equally possible to
prevent cultivation altogether. Moreover, there still remains a
considerable amount of production in many of the Native States
all over India. To induce these States to prohibit cultivation
would be a difficult matter, and, even if this were done, the
suppression of illicit cultivation would offer the most serious
difficulties. For, though ganja of good quality requires some
cultivation and tending, the evidence before the Commission tends
to establish the fact that ganja of an inferior kind can be
manufactured from the spontaneous or casual growth which is found
near human habitations and amidst cultivation of other crops in
many parts of India. While, therefore, it cannot be asserted that
the task of preventing the manufacture of ganja is an impossible
one, it would certainly at the present time be attended with
considerable difficulty.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions of the witnesses regarding prohibition of ganja
and charas. </b></p>

<p>568. The question addressed to the. witnesses regarding the
prohibition of the hemp drugs (No. 35) was so framed as to elicit
in the first place opinions as to the feasibility of such. a
measure. The considerations bearing upon the subject were also
set forth in the form of subsidiary questions. The question
whether the witnesses advocated prohibition. was not specifically
put, but it is not difficult, comparing the answers to the
questions above mentioned with those relating to other questions,
to decide what the opinion of each witness is on this question.
Those who hold decided views have no doubt generally stated them
in some portion of their answers, and at all events ample
opportunity of doing so was afforded them. A larger number of the
witnesses have contented themselves with merely giving an
affirmative or negative answer to the questions on .the subject.
It is impossible to attach much importance to such answers. The
Commission have abstracted them and considered them, but they
feel bound to give far more weight to the opinions of witnesses
whose replies show that they have formulated an opinion, on the
desirability of prohibition. Some account will now be given of
these answers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions regarding prohibition of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p><i>569. </i>Out of the total of 1,193 witnesses, 575 have
expressed a decided opinion on the question of prohibition. Of
these only 99 advocate it in their answers. The remainder are
against it. The classification of these witnesses is shown in the
following table:<br>

<p>Thus, not only is there a very large preponderance of opinion

among superior Civil officers. The only witnesses indeed of the
latter class who favour prohibition are three in the Punjab,
where charas and not ganja is consumed.<br>
</p>

<p>The most important of these opinions on either side will now
be specified. The most forcible opinions in favour of prohibition
will be quoted at some length in order that the argument for this
view may be .thoroughly appreciated. The opinions against
prohibition are too numerous to be quoted, but the witnesses will
be named under headings setting forth the most prominent views
expressed. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja</b> </p>

<p>570. The Bengal witnesses in favour of prohibition of ganja
consist of a Sub-Deputy Collector, an Assistant Surgeon. two
Medical Practitioners, an Honorary Magistrate, two zamindars, two
pleaders, a delegate from the Indian Relief Society, Calcutta,
the Secretary to the Band of Hope, Faridpur, the Secretary to the
Bogra Medical Society, and two Missionaries. The Commission
cannot find much to quote from these opinions, but the following
are the most forcible: </p>

<p><i>(238) Delegate, Indian Relief Society, Calcutta, Babu
Amrita Krishna Mullick, B.A., B.L.: </i>After quoting official
and medical opinions relating to the injuriousness of ganja, the
Society, endeavours to show that the cultivators of the hemp
plant lose largely by their occupation, and maintains that it is
the duty of the Government to come to their rescue by abolishing
it. The society maintains that the privation to the consumers
would not be serious, and that it is difficult to suggest any
drug more deleterious than ganja to which they could take. The
Society contends that the alleged religious sanction to the use
of the drugs is a fallacy, and refers to the opinions of several
pandits in support of this view. The Society argues that to meet
the deficit in the revenue, which would be about lakhs per annum,
the salaries of European officers should be cut down, the duties
on cotton goods re-imposed and the income-tax increased with an
enhanced taxable minimum. Savings would be effected by reduction
of establishment and by decreased cost of lunatic asylums.<br>
</p>

<p><i>(286) Secretary, Band of Hope Temperance Society, Faridpur,
Babu Purna Chandra Maitra: </i>&quot;This Society begs to urge
upon the Commission to consider the justice and propriety of a
just, benign, and Christian Government to allow cultivation and
sale of a drug which has been excluded from some countries, and
in England doubly protected in the poison list.&quot; The witness
argues that the drug&quot; has been unreservedly condemned by
eminent doctors as one of the most dangerous poisons known, as
the most potent cause of lunacy, and as the most pernicious and
deleterious of all excitants ever in use in any country.&quot; He
admits that there are a number of yogis, sanyasis, fakirs, and
mendicants addicted to ganja smoking, but states that ganja
smoking forms no part of their religion, and there is not a
single Hindu or Muhammadan religious book which sanctions the use
of ganja. &quot;No real disaffection can under the benign rule of
the British Government be seriously apprehended, and, even in the
event of there being such apprehension, the fact should not be
lost sight of that the Government in this case will have the
support of the bulk of the population.&quot; He alleges that
ganja produces crime, and that the taxation, amounting to 22
lakhs, is a drain on the poverty-stricken and half-famished
people of Bengal. He finds it difficult to suggest a substitute
for ganja, but liquor may be one, and a peculiar preparation of
strong tobacco may also serve the purpose. </p>

<p><i>(134) Secretary to Bogra Medical Society (10 members),
Pyari SankerDass </i>Gupta, L.M.S.: &quot;the prohibition will
give rise to no political danger. For the ganja smokers have very
little influence over society. The Government has faced questions
of a greater religious character, as the Suttee or the Age of
Consent Act, with boldness. This is comparatively a minor
question affecting only depraved men.&quot; </p>

<p><i>(203) Rev. W. B. Phillips, Missionary.: </i>&quot;What<i> </i>with
liquor and opium and hemp drugs of various kinds, all licensed by
Government, it does seem as if the population were terribly
exposed to degrading influences. It is not my province to face
the difficult task of dealing with these evils; and I sincerely
sympathize with the Government in the heavy duty of solving the
grave problems involved. But I do feel it my duty to set forth as
strongly as possible the assurance that very much mischief is
being worked in the country by the various intoxicants so freely
and largely sold. I hardly care to distinguish between opium,
alcohol, and ganja. I regard them all as bad. My mind is so
impressed with the evil effects of excessive use that I do not
care to consider the moderate use. I would wish Government to
begin with ganja, to proceed with little delay-against opium, and
then tackle alcohol. I prefer this as a matter of policy, as
ganja is easiest dealt with I am prepared to prohibit all three
intoxicants on account of the evil which I see done by them. </p>

<p><i>(81) Kali Das Mukerji, Sub-Deputy Collector: </i>After
advocating prohibition of ganja on the grounds of the evil
effects, and stating that there would be no danger from the
discontent caused owing to the small number of the consumers, the
witness proceeds: &quot;The<i> </i>reasons usually put forward in
favour of ganja consumption are as follows: (1) that Hindu friars
and jogis cannot do without it, for it helps them in their
religious contemplation, and sustains them under severe exertion
and exposure; (2) that it is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts; and (3) that it serves the labouring classes as
a refreshing stimulant, alleviating fatigue. I do not think that
any of these reasons is conclusive, though plausible. In fact,
none of them stands the test of close examination. If any
intoxicating drug is at all necessary for friars and jogis
alcohol, opium or siddhi may serve the purpose. Eight kinds of
intoxicating drugs are prescribed in the Tantras for Hindu
devotees, and it is optional with them to take any if they care
to do so at all. That ganja is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts is not necessarily true Even as a stimulant and
remover of fatigue, ganja has very little to recommend it to the
labouring classes A careful observation is sure to establish the
fact that any ordinary labourer whose only stimulant is tobacco
is on the whole a better workman than his ganja consuming
brother.&quot; <br>
</p>

prohibition of ganja, but the following analysis of some of the

<p><b>Assam.Assam.Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b>
</p>

<p>572. The opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja in Assam
are those of a Civil Surgeon, the Secretary to the Tezpur Raiyats
Association, the Secretary to the Upper Assam .Association, a
merchant, and a pensioned Overseer, Public Works Department, and
member of a Local Board. There is nothing especially to note in
these opinions. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against.</b>. </p>

<p>573. Against prohibition we have the Commissioner of the Assam
Valley, the Commissioner of Excise, the Director of Land Records
and Agriculture, an Officiating Deputy Commissioner, a Civil
Surgeon, an Extra Assistant Commissioner, a medical practitioner,
four pleaders, and four planters.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Mr. Driberg,</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Commissioner of Excise</i>,
says: &quot;It would be useless to prohibit the use of ganja in a
province like Assam, surrounded as it is by independent hill
people, who would cultivate it in their hills and smuggle it down
with little risk of detection. Any prohibition will only lead to
the increase of illicit consumption and to the secret use of the
drug, which would be decidedly bad; of course, stop cultivation
in Bengal, and the prohibition of the use of excise ganja could
be enforced; but there would be serious discourse, though in this
province it might not amount to a political danger, and the
prohibition would be followed by recourse to opium, and in some
cases to alcohol.&quot; The evidence of planters tends generally
to show that the use of ganja by the garden coolies, who (except
in the western districts of the Assam Valley and those of the
Surma Valley, all of which border on Bengal) are the principal
consumers, produces no serious effects. There is nothing in any
of the Assam evidence to controvert these views. <br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.Opinions in favour of prohibition
of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p>574. The advocates of prohibition of ganja and charas in the
North-Western Provinces are as follows: 6 subordinate civil
officers, 9 subordinate medical officers and private medical
practitioners, and 18 non-officials. Butfew of these witnesses
give any reasons for their opinions. And the Commission are not
able to quote any one of them as having any special weight. The
only opinion which it appears worth while to quote is that of a
Collector (Mr. Addis (4), who does not, however, specifically
recommend prohibition. He says: &quot;It probably would be
feasible to prohibit the use of all these drugs. Public opinion
is against their use, and the people are very obedient to
authority. The prohibition would certainly lead to the increased
use of opium and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition.</b> </p>

<p>575. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
very strong. The following is an analysis of some of the most
important:- </p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment.</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble A. Cadell, Member, Board of Revenue.(5) Mr.
Stoker, Commissioner of Excise(12) Mr. Brownrigg, Officiating
Deputy Commissioner.(2o) Mr. Partridge, Officiating Deputy
Commissioner.(9) Mr. Jackson, Collector.(10) Mr. Tweedy,

Joint(227) Syad Mahammad Nuh, Zamindar. </p>

<p><i>(3) Prohibition might lead to use of dhatura or other
intoxicants worse than ganja or charas.</i> </p>

<p>(6) Mr. Stoker, Commissioner of Excise.(15) Mr. Ferard,
Collector (28) Mr. Bruce, Assistant Collector.(51) Thakur Tukman
Singh, Deputy Collector. Punjab 576. The advocates of the
prohibition of charas Opinions for prohibition of charas. in the
Punjab are as follows:-- 3 superior civil officers, 3 subordinate
civi1 officers, 2 subordinate medical officers, and 10
non-officials.It may be noted that <i>Mr. Ogilvie, Financial
Commissioner in charge of Excise (2), </i>records the following
opinion: &quot;I am inclined to hold the opinion, though I am not
quite satisfied on the subject, that the use of charas is so
deleterious that it might be permissible, both on grounds of
morality and utility, for its use to be prohibited or for the
price of the drug to be so artificially raised as to confine its
consumption to a very small number indeed. The reason why I say
that I am not quite satisfied on the point is because I have not
sufficiently investigated the facts. All that I can, therefore,
say with certainty is that my opinion tends to the direction
above indicated I would observe, however, with regard to the
Yarkand trade that the imposition of a duty so high as to be
practically prohibitive would very considerably injure that
trade, . because the Yarkand trader in exchange for the churns
takes back the products of the Punjab to his own country or to
Kashmir. The extinction or serious injury of the Yarkand trade
would, of course, be a very regrettable circumstance. On the
other hand from my personal knowledge as Deputy Commissioner of
the Dera  Ismail Khan District, I would say no harm would
accrue to general trade on the western border from the
prohibition of churns.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Coldstream. Deputy Commissioner (5), </i>though he does
not seem to have formed a definite opinion regarding the moderate
use of the drugs, says: &quot;The <i>gradual </i>stoppage of
import of ganja and charas might be tried. It is not as yet a
very widely-spread habit, but it might grow. It would cause gent
pain and discontent if the prohibition were sudden and
comprehensive, but this would not amount to political danger. A
prohibitory measure regarding ganja and charas would no doubt be
followed at once by a recourse to opium and alcohol. I can quite
believe the moderate occasional use of the drugs may be
comparatively harmless, but I am not aware that they are commonly
used occasionally and in moderation. They may, however, be so
used for all I know.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner (14), </i>says that he
should like to see the experiment made in selected districts of
prohibiting trade in charas (and bhang) all together. As regards
charas, he thinks the prohibition would be feasible, as it is
imported, and the discontent would be insignificant. knows of no
class, such as labourers, who take the drug in moderation as an
ordinary stimulant. Among fakirs and other excessive consumers,
he thinks the use produces great evils, and that there is no more
harmful drug which they are likely to take to. He does not know
anything of the use of dhatura except its administration as a
poison. He thinks sudden prohibition would be cruel. He would
therefore begin by taxation and gradually raise it, leaving the
question of total prohibition to be decided by experience. The
evidence of <i>Arjan Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner </i>(19),
is much to the same effect, but he states that the use of dhatura
is general among the followers of Siva at the Shivratri in the
Dera Ghazi Khan district. He says it is taken in very small
quantities, so that its effect is almost imperceptible. <i>General
Millet (69), </i>formerly District Superintendent of Police,
would like to see all intoxicants prohibited which cannot be
proved to be actually necessary. He thinks gradual prohibition of
the hemp drugs feasible, and that educated, intelligent native
public opinion, which to a great extent leads that of the lower
classes, would support prohibition. Discontent at first among the
degraded classes would be inevitable, but there would be no
political danger, though tact and discretion would be needed and
calm-minded European officials at the helm. He fears that
recourse to alcohol would be the result. <i>Shekh Riaz Husain,
zamindar (67), </i>thinks that &quot;having regard for the
welfare and good of the people which the British Government has
in view, the prohibition of the hemp drugs (including bhang) is
imperatively necessary. Loyal and intelligent subjects and
well-wishers of the country would welcome the prohibition, though
the unscrupulous habitual consumers would indeed dislike it. But
as it would be for the good of the people, it is not hoped that
any class of persons would resent it. The enforcement of the
prohibition should be effected like other new laws and
regulations, exceptions being made to some extent in the case of
the existing old habitual consumers, because its sudden stoppage
would cause them serious privation. The discontent resulting
would not amount to a political danger. If it were possible to
make charas as expensive as alcohol, that would be one way of
dealing with the subject.&quot;<i>Sardar Sujan Singh, Rai
Bahadur, Contractor (59), </i>considers charas as certainly most
injurious, and thinks its use should most certainly be
prohibited. It does no good to anybody. There are not many <i>kahars
</i>who take it. Those who do, go to the bad. He does not know of
the use. of dhatura as an intoxicant. The use of madak and chandu
is more injurious than charas, and they also should be prohibited
as well as liquor. He would not recommend immediate prohibition,
but would put on such a tax, increasing it gradually, as to make
it impossible for the majority of people to buy them at all.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Dr. H. M. Clark, Missionary (46), </i>would like to see
charas prohibited if it were possible, He thinks. however, that
alcohol does more harm than charas. He cannot believe that a
moderate use of charas is possible. Fakirs and devotees are the
chief consumers. <i>Devi Dayal, Editor of the Kaitistha Mitra,*
Lahore, </i>circulation 300 copies (83), says: &quot;If charas be
called poison (fatal, killing, murdering drug), it is not an
exaggeration of any kind. It is a great vice to smoke charas. May
God not give this even in the lot of a foe. Only just people as
have bad luck get engaged in this vice. Government will do their
subjects a very great obligation by saving them from early death
and whirlpool of destruction and ruin. My present belief is that
there is no such thing as moderation in the use of chards,
because, when a c<i>harsi </i>visits another, he offers him the c<i>hillum,
</i>and they smoke in company. The smoke is thus repeated
frequently.&quot; Consumers acknowledge that they would have no
complaint; and if Government were to prohibit the use of charas
to-morrow, the bad habit would die out of itself. <i>Ganesh Das,
Pleader, and President, Sarin Sabha, Hoshiarpur </i>(77): Charas
jogis, sanyasis, and suthra fakirs, andis consumed by shoemakers,
musicians, by some Khatris and Brahmins. The physical effects are
very bad, and most consumers become incapacitated for work and
lead a miserable life. The subcommittee of the Sarin Sabha
appointed to consider the subject recommend prohibition. Enquiry
was not made from medical experts. Consumers would not take to
other intoxicants, because the intoxication of chards is not like
that of opium or other intoxicants. The greatest loss would be
that of the traders of Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, who take
merchandise to Ladakh and Yarkand and bring back charas.<br>

<p><b>Madrass </b><b><tt>Opinions in favour </tt></b><b>of </b><b><tt>the
prohibition of ganja</tt></b> </p>

<p>580. The Madras witnesses in favour of prohibition are a Civil
Surgeon, a subordinate civil officer, a medical practitioner, a
Hindu priest, and six missionaries. Dr. King, (85) says-
&quot;The restriction of the sale of ganja under conditions
similar to those required for poisonous drugs in Great Britain
would be an unqualified blessing to the country, thus contrasting
with the action taken against agitation which I believe to be
unnecessary and mischievous. I consider special measures should
be taken to restrain the use of ganja by sepoys, and especially
to prevent the young sepoy from acquiring the habit&quot; In oral
examination however, Dr. King, stated as follows- &quot;My
opinion of the effect of the moderate use in impairing the moral
sense and inducing laziness, etc., is a general impression and
not based on actual observation. My impression is based on the
fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have
presented these characteristics. They were pointed out as
notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases
between the moderate and excessive use.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Synd Mahmud(I22) </i>says: &quot;It<i> </i>is an
unquestionable fact that ganja, bhang, and charas are poisons,
and this fact is admitted by all. In my opinion their suppression
would be an act of virtue deserving of future reward, but it is
not advisable to suppress their use at once. Its suppression
should be regulated under certain rules without any loss to the
State. To the best of my knowledge and researches, alcohol cannot
be safely used as a substitute for ganja, charas, and
bhang.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Rev. Mr. Laflamme </i>(153) speaking on behalf of the
Baptist Missionary Conferences of the Presidency, advocates
prohibition in these terms: &quot;Owing to the scarcity of shops
in these parts practical prohibition exists. Much that is
consumed is consumed illicitly. The introduction of the license
system Seems to have had no appreciable effect on the use of the
drugs. The ganja is nearly all grown by the consumers in their
own yards.&quot; &quot;The drugs should all be so safeguarded as
to prevent or minimize any possible harm resulting from their
abuse.&quot; &quot;The<i> </i>general sense of the people is
opposed to the use of the drugs.&quot; So far as the witness can
gather, the members of the Mission are. united in the belief that
in these parts hemp drugs are far less injurious than opium and
alcohol; thus far that the latter are not only much more
extensively used, but much more baleful in, their effects. Two
other missionaries, though neutral in opinion, are worth quoting <i>Rev.
Mr. Pittendrigh Missionary (160) </i>says that he would have
ultimate prohibition in view if possible, but there is not much
ground for special interference in anything that he has seen.
Another Missionary, the <i>Rev. Mr. Goffin. </i>(145), cannot
undertake to criticise the present or any system of exise
administration. His impression is that Government would be wise
to adopt strictly &quot;let-alone&quot; policy, leaving it to the
spread of education and enlightenment among the people to prevent
and lessen all its effects. The province government should be
carefully to watch such effects, and wherever and whenever
necessary interfere with prohibitive legislation. Such necessity,
however, in his opinion would not often occur.<br>

<p><b>Bombay. Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b> </p>

<p>582. For the prohibition of ganja or charas in Bombay and
Sind, we have the following advocates: in Bombay two mamlatdars,
a hospital assistant, and a medical practitioner; and in Sind a
health officer, two hospital assistants, and a. banker. There is
not much that need be quoted from the evidence of these
witnesses. It may be noted that the Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie,
Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (1), holds that the policy of
Government in relation to the hemp drugs should be one of
restriction, as far as restriction, 'is possible, and that, if
absolute prohibition were possible, he thinks it would be a good
thing. Owing, however, to the fact that the territories of the
Bombay Presidency interlace so extensively with foreign
territory, and to the feeling which would be aroused among the
consumers and those who sympathize with them, it would in his
opinion be impossible or undesirable. The Secretary to the Arya
Samaj in Bombay (109) states that while fully sympathising with
the objects of the Commission, which are apparently understood to
be the restriction or prohibition of the drugs, the Arya Samaj
&quot;is of opinion that any Governmental action in the direction
of further restricting the preparation and sale of the drug will
be productive of very little good. The <b>' </b>* Samaj believes
that education of the masses is the only proper and effective .
remedy for correcting such baneful habits, and fears that any
compulsion in<b> </b>this matter is likely to drive the consumers
of these comparatively innoccuous drugs to the use. of more
injurious intoxicants that are plentifully supplied to the people
like the various preparations containing alcohol.&quot; The
Samaj.prays that the Government will devise measures for the
restriction of the sale of European liquor in India. and leave
the hemp drugs to themselves. The only<b> </b>thorough advocate
of prohibition whose opinion is worth specifying is Rao
SahibShesho Krisna Madkavi (41), who considers-such prohibition
very necessary and holds that, although there would be temporary
discontent among the consumers such discontent would not amount
to a political danger &quot;the<i> </i>people in this part of the
country being loyal and of mild nature. and the proportion of the
persons using bhang and ganja to the general population being too
small to be taken into consideration.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>583. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
weighty. The following may be specially quoted:<br>
</p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment. Bombay</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc (3)
Mr. Vidal, Chief Secretary to Government. (10) Mr. Monteath,
CoIlector. (12) Mr. Cumine, Acting Collector. (53) Mr. Vincent,
C.I.E., officiating commissioner of Police. (110) Rai Bahadur
Vishvanath Keshava Joglekar, Merchant. (108) Daji Abaji Khare,
Honorary Secretary, East Indian Association. </p>

<p><i>Sind </i></p>

<p>(1) Mr. James, Commissioner in Sind. (26) Seth Vishindas
Nihalchand, Zamindar and Merchant. <br>
</p>

<p><i>(2) Prohibition would be strongly resented by religious
mendicants, or would be regarded as an interference with
religion, or would be likely to become a political danger.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bombay. </i></p>

<p>(l) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (2)
Mr. Reid, Commissioner ganja. Apart from all this, there is
another consideration which has been urged in some quarters with
a manifestation of strong feeling, and to which the Commission
are disposed to attach some importance, <i>viz.</i>, that to
repress the drugs in India and to leave alcohol alone would be
misunderstood by a large number of persons who believe, and
apparently not without reason, that more harm is done in this
country by the latter than by the former. The conclusion of the
Commission regarding bhang has been given in paragraph 564; under
all the circumstances they now unhesitatingly give their verdict
against such a violent measure as total prohibition in respect of
any of the hemp drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>II. The policy advocated is one of control and restriction
aimed at suppressing the excessive use and restraining the
moderate use within due limits (Chapter XlV, paragraph 586) <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Policy in regard to hemp drugs.</b> </p>

<p><tt>586 </tt>Failing prohibition, the question arises, what
should be the policy of the Policy in regard to hemp drugs.
Government in regard to the hemp drugs? On this point some
important evidence has been recorded, and the Commission deem it
to be within the scope of their duty to state in general terms
their own conclusions. In the first place, then, they are of
opinion that in view of the harmful effects produced by the
excessive use, and in exceptional cases even by the moderate use,
of the drugs, the action of the Government should be directed
towards restraining the former and avoiding all encouragement to
the latter. The object should be to prevent the consumers, as far
as may be possible, from doing harm to themselves and to lessen
the inducements to the formation of the habit which might lead to
such harm In aiming at this object, however, other considerations
need to be kept in view. There is in the first place the question
of illicit consumption. If the restriction. imposed by Government
is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in smuggling no
advantage is gained but, on the contrary, a moral wrong is done
to the community apart from the annoyance necessitated by such
restrictions. Than, if there is a legitimate use of the drugs,
restrictions should not be such as to make the exercise of this
use impossible. The Commission have formed the opinion that there
is a legitimate use of the hemp drugs, and that it exists
generally among the poorest of the population. Again, if the
restrictions lead to the use of more deleterious substances, or
even drive the people from a habit the evil of which is known to
another of which the evil maybe greater, they are no longer
justifiable. The policy of Government must be tempered by all
these considerations, and the neglect of any one of them may lead
to serious error. <br>

<p><b>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report</b> </p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. G. A. GRIERSON, C.I.E., MAGISTRATE AND
COLLECTOR, HOWRAH, ON REFERENCES TO THE HEMP PLANT OCCURRING IN
SANSKRIT AND HINDI LITERATURE</b></p>

<hr>

<p>I have the honour to state that I have searched through all
the Sanskrit and Hindi books accessible to me, and to forward the
accompanying note on the references to the hemp plant occurring
in the literatures of those languages.<br>
</p>

<p>I have met the hemp plant in Sanskrit and Hindi literature
under various names. The principal are:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) Bhanga. </p>

<p>(2) Indracana. </p>

<p>(3) Vijaya or Jaya<br>
</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the word ganja which I have noted is
dated about the year 1300 A.D.<br>
</p>

<p>Whenever the word vijaya is used, it is doubtful whether the
hemp plant is meant, or the yellow myrobolan, as the words means
both. <br>
</p>

<p>The name Bhanga occurs in the Atharvaveda (say, B.C. 1400).
The hemp plant is there mentioned simply as a sacred grass.
Panini (say, B.C. 300) mentions the pollen of the hemp flower
(bhanga). In the commencement of the sixth century we find the
first mention of vijaya which I have noted. It is a sacred grass,
and probably means here the hemp plant.<br>
</p>

<p>The first mention of bhanga as a medicine which I have noted
is in the work of Sucruta (before the eighth century A.D.), where
it is called an antiphlegmatic. During the next four centuries
bhanga (feminine) frequently occurs in native Sanskrit
dictionaries in the sense of hemp-plant.<br>
</p>

<p>In the tenth century the intoxicating nature of bhang seems to
have been known: and the name <i>Indracana</i>, Indra's food,
first appears, so far as I know, in literature. Its intoxicating
power was certainly known in the beginning of the fourteenth
century. In a play written in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, it is mentioned as being consumed by jogis (Caiva
mendicants). It is there named &quot;Indra's food.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In later medical works it is frequently mentioned under
various names.<br>
</p>

<p>I append a more detailed account of the passages in which I
have noted the uses of the Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>I may add that I have not traced in literature any difference
between the uses of the word ganja and the word bhanga, though
modern <i>kavirajas</i> tells me that they are distinct plants. <br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B.C. 1400. In the <i>Atharvaveda</i> (cir. 1400 B.C.) the
bhang plant is mentioned (11, 6, 15) once:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;We tell of the five kingdoms of herbs headed by Soma;
may it and <i>kuca</i> grass, and <i>bhanga</i> and barley, and
the herb <i>saha</i> release us from anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Here reference is evidently made to the offering of these
herbs in oblations.<br>
</p>

<p>The grammarian Panini (5, 2, 29) mentions <i>bhangukata</i>,
the pollen of the hemp flower, as one of his examples.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. B. C. 300.<br>
</p>

<p>The fact that the pollen of this special flower was quoted is
worth noting.<br>
</p>

<p>Varahamihira in his <i>Brihatsamhita</i> (XLVIII, 39),
mentions <i>vijaya</i> as used with other grasses in the rotes of
the <i>Pusya</i>, bathing festival.<br>
</p>

<p>A.D. 504.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is this passage certainly means some plant or
other. The word may mean either the Indian hemp-plant or be a
synonym of <i>haritaki</i> (the yellow myrobolan). Dr. Hoernle
informs me that in the oldest medical words the word is explained
by commentators in the latter sense. It is doubtful what meaning
we are to adopt here. The word <i>may</i> mean the hemp-plant <i>bhanga</i>.
In the passage from the Atharvaveda, already quoted, amongst the
five plants special honoured as oblations, <i>bhanga</i> is
closely connected with the herb <i>saha</i>. So also in the
Brihatsamhita, <i>vijaya</i> is mentioned as one of a long list
of plants to be used in the offering, and the very next plant
mentioned is <i>saha</i>, which is apparently the same as <i>saha</i>.
This would encourage the theory that the <i>vijaya</i> of the
Brihatsamhita was more probably the same as the <i>bhanga</i> of
the Atbarvaveda. <br>
</p>

<p>In Sucruta (Ut. XI, 3) <i>Bhanga</i> is recommended together
with a number of other drugs as an antiphlegmatic.<br>
</p>

<p>Before the eighth century.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Vijaya</i> is mentioned in the same work as a remedy for
catarrh accompanied by diarrhea (Ut. XXIV, 20, and Ut. 39, page
415, 20), as an ingredient in a prescription for fever arising
from an excess of bile and phlegm. In these two passages,
however, <i>vijaya</i> is probably an equivalent of <i>haritaki</i>,
the yellow myrobolan, and does not mean hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>In the various <i>kosas</i>, or dictionaries, <i>bhanga</i> is
frequently mentioned as meaning the hemp-plant. Thus,<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Amarakosa</i>, 2, 9, 20.<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 500. (2) <i>Trikandacesa</i>, 3, 364.<br>
</p>

<p>Tenth or eleventh century(3) <i>Hemacandra's Anekarthakosa</i>,
2, 37.<br>
</p>

<p>Twelfth century. (4) <i>Hemakandra's Abhidhanacinlamani</i>,
1179. <br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Sarasundari</i> (date not known to me), a commentary on
the Amarakosa mentioned above, </p>

<p>Twelfth century by Mathureca, and quoted in the
Cabdakalpadruma, mentions that the seed of the <i>bhanga</i>
plant is the size of that of millet (<i>kalaya</i>).<br>
</p>

<p>Cakrapanidatta is said to have flourished under Nayapala, a
prince who reigned </p>

<p>Cir. 1050 A.D. in the eleventh century A.D. In his <i>Cabdacandrika</i>,
a medical vocabulary, he gives the following Sanskrit names for
bhang:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Vijaya</i> (victorious), (2) <i>Trailokyavijaya</i>
(victorious in the three worlds), (3) <i>bhanga</i>, (4) <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food), (5) <i>Jaya</i> (victorious).<br>
</p>

<p>These names seem to show that its use as an intoxicant was
then known.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rajanighantu</i> of Narahari Pandita adds the following
names to those given by </p>

<p>A.D. 1300. Cakrapanidatta in the <i>Cabdacandrika</i> above
mentioned: <br>
</p>

<p>(6) <i>Virapattra</i> (hero-leaved or the leaf of heroes), </p>

<p>(7) <i>Ganja</i>, </p>

<p>(8) <i>Capala</i> (the light-hearted), </p>

<p>(9) <i>Ajaya</i> (the unconquered), </p>

<p>(10) <i>Ananda</i> (the joyful), </p>

<p>(11) <i>Harsini</i> (the rejoicer)<br>
</p>

<p>and adds that the plant possesses the following qualities:<br>
</p>

<p>(1) <i>Katulva</i> (acridity); (2) <i>kasayatra</i>
(astringency); (3) <i>Usnatva</i> (heat); (4) <i>tiktatva</i>
(pungency); (5) <i>vatakaphapahatva</i> (removing wind and
phlegm); (6) <i>samgrahitva</i> (astringency); (7) <i>vakpradatva</i>
(speech-giving); (8)<i>balyatva</i> (strength-giving); (9) <i>medhakaritva</i>
(inspiring of mental power); (10) <i>cresthadipanatva</i> (the
property of a most excellent excitant).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Carngadhrasamhita</i>, a medical work by Carngadhara,
the date of which is unknown, </p>

<p>Say A.D. 1500. but which must have been compiled during the
Muhammadan </p>

<p>period of Indian History, specially mentions (1, 4, 19) <i>bhanga</i>
as an excitant (<i>vyavayin</i>). In the same passage it mentions
opium.<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Dhurtasamagama</i>, or &quot;Rogues' Congress,&quot; is
the name of an amusing if coarsely </p>

<p>A.D. 1550. written farce of about the year 1500 A.D., the
author of </p>

<p>which was one Jyotirica. In the second act two Caiva
mendicants came before an unjust judge, and demand a decision on
a quarrel which they have about a nymph of the bazar. The judge
demands payment of a deposit before he will give any opinion. One
of the litigants says:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Here is my ganja bag; let it be accepted as a
deposit.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The Judge (<i>taking it pompously, and then smelling it
greedily</i>): &quot;Let me try what it is like (<i>takes a pinch</i>).
Ah! I have just now got by the merest chance some ganja which is
soporific and corrects derangements of the humours, which
produces a healthy appetite, sharpens the wits, and acts as an
aphrodisiac.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The word used for ganja in the above is <i>Indracana</i>
(Indra's food).<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Bhavaprakaca</i>, another medical work written by
Bhavadevamicra (cir. A.D. 1600), has as follows:<br>
</p>

<p>Cir. A. D. 1600.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Bhanga ganja matulani madini vijaya jaya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bhanga kaphahari tikta grahini pacani laghuh<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Tiksosna pittala moha -mada vag vahni vardhini<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Bhanga is also called <i>ganja, matulani, madini</i>
(the intoxicating), <i>vijaya</i> (the victorious), and <i>jaya</i>
(the victorious). It is antiphlegmatic, pungent, astringent,
digestive, easy of digestion, acid, bile-affecting; and increases
infatuation, intoxication, the power of the voice, and the
digestive faculty.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The <i>Rajavallabha, a materia medica</i>, by
Narayanadasa kaviraja, the date of which I </p>

<p>17th century. do not know, but which is quoted in the <i>Cabdakalpadruma,
and</i> is believed to be ancient, has the following:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Cakra-canam tu tiksno-snam moha-krit kustha-nacanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bala-medha-gni-krit-clesma -dosa-hari rasayanam<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Jata mandara-manthanaj jala-nidhau piyusa-rupa pura<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Trailokye vijaya-prade 'ti vijaya cri-devaraja-priya<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Lokanam hita-kamyaya ksiti-tale prapta naraih kamada<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarva-&quot; tanka-vinaca-harsa-janani yaih sevita sarvada.
<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;Indra's food (i.e. ganja) is acid, produces infatuation,
and destroys leprosy. It creates vital energy, the mental powers,
and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic
humour, and is an elixir vitae. It was originally produced, like
nectar, from the ocean by the churning with Mount Mandara, and
inasmuch as it gives victory in the three worlds, it, the delight
of the king of the gods, is called <i>vijaya</i>, the victorious.
This desire-fulfilling drug was obtained by men on the earth,
through desire for the welfare of all people. To those who
regularly use it it begets joy and destroys every anxiety.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The <i>Rasapradhipa</i>, a work, the date of which is unknown
to me, and which is quoted in </p>

<p>? Date. the <i>Cabdakalpadruma</i> mentions <i>jaya</i> as a
remedy for indigestion:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Ksaratrayam sutagandhou pancakolam idam cubham<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Sarvais tulya jaya bhrista tad-ardha cigruja jata<br>
</i></p>

<p>Natron, saltpetre and borax, mercury and sulphur, and the
prosperous five spices (long pepper, its root, <i>piper chaba</i>,
another pepper, and dry ginger). To these add an equal amount of
parched <i>jaya</i> and half of that amount of horse-radish (<i>moringa</i>)
and <i>jata</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>It is not certain whether <i>jaya</i> here means bhang or <i>Haritaki</i>
(yellow myrobolan). The word has both significations. The latter,
perhaps, suits the formula best.<br>
</p>

<p>In the <i>Rasaratna-samuccaya</i>, a work written in the south
of India, <i>jaya</i> is classified as a semi-poison,<br>
</p>

<p><i>Langoli visamustic ca karaviro jaya tatha<br>
</i></p>

<p>? Date<br>
</p>

<p><i>Tilakah kanako rkac ca vargo hy upavisatmakah.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Langali</i> (Vanguiera spinosa), the root of the Nerium
odorum, <i>jaya</i> (Symplocos racemosa) <i>kanaka</i> and <i>ak</i>
(a kind of Euphorbia), are semi-poisonous.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang is frequently mentioned by vernacular poets. The oldest
instance with which I </p>

<p>1400 A.D. am acquainted is the well-known hymn by Vidyapati </p>

<p>Tbakur (1400 A.D.), in which he calls Civa &quot;<i>Digambara
bhanga</i>,&quot; in reference to his habit of consuming that
drug. According to an old Hindu poem, on which I cannot now lay
my hands, Civa himself brought down the bhang plant from the
Himalayas and gave it to mankind. Jogis are well-known consumers
of bhang and ganja, and they are worshippers of Civa.<br>
</p>

<p>In folk-songs, ganja or bhang (with or without opium) is the
invariable drink of heroes before performing any great feat. At
the village of Bauri in Gaya there is a huge hollow stone, which
is said to be the bowl in which the famous hero Lorik mixed his
ganja. Lorik was a very valiant general, and is the hero of
numerous folk-songs. The epic poem of Alha and Rudal, or
uncertain date, but undoubtedly based on very old materials (the
heroes lived in the twelfth century A.D.), contains numerous
references to ganja as a drink of warriors. For instance, the
commencement of the canto dealing with Alha's marriage, describes
the pestle and mortar with which the ganja was prepared, the
amount of the intoxicating drink prepared from it (it is called <i>sabzi</i>)
and the amount of opium (an absurdly exaggerated quantity) given
to each warrior in his court.<br>
</p>

<p>That the consumption of bhang is not considered disreputable
among Rajputs may be gathered from the fact that Ajabes, who was
court poet to the well-known Maharaja Bishwanath Singh of Riwa,
wrote a poem praising bhang and comparing <i>siddhi</i> to the
&quot;success&quot; which attends the worshipper of
&quot;Hari.&quot; Here there is an elaborate series of puns. The
word <i>siddhi</i> means literally 'success,' and <i>hari</i>
means not only the god Hari, but also bhang. </p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin</i>._In 1867 Babu Ananda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in-law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <br>
</p>

<p><i>Antecedents of the originator</i>._Dhamrai is an important
village in the Dacca district noted for its car festival, which
is annually held in honor of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur</i>,
and which is witnessed by a large gathering of people.<br>
</p>

<p>Ananda Chandra received education at the Dacca Normal School.
After leaving school he served for some time as a pundit
(schoolmaster), and then entered the Police Department, but was
there only a short time. He is a Barendra Brahman and belongs to
a respectable family. He learnt to smoke ganja when he was only a
boy. His present age is 60 years. He has the reputation of being
a versifier. He smokes two pice worth of ganja every day.<br>
</p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali</i> (poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (1,000 copies) was sold in
a few months.<br>
</p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first started</i>._Ananda
Chandra Kali was at the time living in the house of his
father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the worship of a
common god, who might be worshipped by all classes, rich and
poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas, Baishnavas,
and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having the present
worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things, such as ganja,
oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.<br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri</i>, three, and <i>Nath</i>,
lord) is represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu
Trinity in one.<br>
</p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself, Ananda Kali may have also
thought that by introducing the worship he would be able to save
the ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed
in the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or
pious act.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship</i>._The following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela</i>
Panchali gives some idea of the subject:<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the
nether world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator) declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their desire
to come to this world in one form to receive worship.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The worship should be made in a form in which the rich
and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Only three things, each worth one pice, are required for
this <i>puja</i> (form of worship). The things which please all
must be selected. The offering should consist of <i>siddhi</i>
(ganja), <i>pan</i> (betel-leaf), and oil, each worth one pice. <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums</i>
with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and reverence.
When all the worshipers are assembled the lamp should be lit with
three wicks, and the praises of Trinath should be sung. As long
as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and his praises
chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at the close of
the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali</i> is finished,
those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad</i> (the
offering which has been accepted by the god), <i>i.e. chillum</i>
of ganja, shall be consigned to eternal hell, and the sincere
worshippers shall go to heaven.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>How the worship spread</i>._Ananda Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja-smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca. </p>

<p>NOTE BY MR. J.M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND REVENUE
AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP<br>
</p>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi</i>, or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the hysteria-curing <i>bel</i>, gle marmelos, so the
properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding aascetics Mahadev.<br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangri,' 'Bhangi,' apparently that the
sound of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing
influences. Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy
name must be repeated, and also at the watering which, for the
space of a year, the young plants must daily receive. When the
flowers appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the
plant and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one
hundred repetitions of the holy name Bhangri, the leaves and
flowers should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed.
When they are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due
repeating of the holy name as a <i>jap</i> or muttered charm.
Then, bearing in mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and
offering a prayer, the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and
sanctified place. Bhang so prepared, especially if prayers are
said over it, will gratify the wishes and desires of its owner.
Taken in the early morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin,
frees him from the punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him
to reap the fruits of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such
sanctified bhang taken at daybreak or noon destroys disease.
Before the religious user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight
Guardians with clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his
orders. The wish of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due
reverence over the Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goodness
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-scaring and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding, when the bridegroom and his friends are entertained at
the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is drunk by the
guests. The Gujarat Musalman bride before and after marriage
drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or North Indian
Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at weddings, but the
Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is despised by his
caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit time during which
bhang plays an important part is the time of war. Before the
outbreak of a war and during its progress the Ling of Mahadev
should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving panic
influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name of
Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and wariness. So the
beleagured Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after loosing
his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance, drinks the
sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes his <i>juhar</i>
or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of panic-scaring that makes
bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious, specially dear to Mahadev in his
character of Tripur, the slayer of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva
is fond of <i>bel</i> leaves, as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi</i>
leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond of bhang leaves. He who wishes to
obtain his desires must constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar.<br>
</p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stricken performs the Viraya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken ceases to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
be had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang and
recovered. The fame of this cure brings to Benares sufferers from
fever which no ordinary medicine can cure. The sufferers are laid
in the temple and pour bhang over the Ling whose virtue has
gained it the name Jvareshwar, the Fever-Lord. In Bombay many
people sick of fever vow on recovery to pour bhang over a Ling.
Besides as a cure for fever bhang has many medicinal virtues. It
cools the heated blood, soothes the over-wakeful to sleep, gives
beauty, and secures length of days. It cures dysentery and
sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite,
makes the tongue of the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and
gives alertness to the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the
useful and needful ends for which in his goodness the Almighty
made bhang. In this praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great
Greek-Arab work on drugs joins. Ganja in excess causes abscess,
even madness. In moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is
a cordial, a bile absorber, an appetiser, a prolonger of life.
Bhang quickens fancy, deepens thought, and braces judgment. <br>
</p>

<p>As on other guardian-possessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or
the leaf of the <i>bel</i> tree, oaths are taken on the bhang
leaf. Even to a truthful witness an oath on the bhang leaf is
dreaded. To one who foreswears himself the bhang oath is death. <br>
</p>

<p>So holy a plant must play a leading part in temple rites.
Shiva on fire with the poison churned from the ocean was cooled
by bhang. At another time enraged with family worries the god
withdrew to the fields. The cool share of a plant soothed him. He
crushed and ate of the leaves, the bhang refreshed him. For these
two benefits bhang is Shankarpriya, the beloved of Mahadev. So
the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning to drink or
to smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena Shankar, lena
Babulnath: be pleased to take it Shankar, take it Babulnath.
According to the Shiva Purana, from the dark fourteenth of Magh
(January-February) to the light fourteenth of Asbadh (July-July),
that is, during the three months of the hot weather, bhang should
be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva. If not every day, bhang
should be poured at least during the first and last days of this
period. According to the Meru Tantra on any Monday, especially on
Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all twelfths or <i>pradoshs</i>,
and on all dark fourteenths of <i>shivratris</i>, still more on
the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on the dark fourteenth
of Magh (January-February), and at all eclipses of the sun or
moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the world to
come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the Ling. Not
every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such rites in
Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and Babulnath
temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang offered to
Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed with water,
water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over the Ling.
According to some authorities the offerer should not touch the
offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans, Bhojaks,
Bhopis, Bharadis, Guravas alone should drink it. If there are no
ministrants the remains of the offering should be poured into a
well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities encourage the
offerer to sip the bhang, since by sipping the bhang reaches and
soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the sipper. On
certain special occasions during failures of rain, during
eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are poured
over the Ling.<br>
</p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu or the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Balaram, or Dauji, the elder brother of
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banias,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits, instead of spirits present bhang. In Bombay the offering
of bhang to Baladev, unlike the special offerings to Shiva, is a
common and every-day rite. Without an offering of bhang no
worship of Baladev is complete. Unlike the plain or milk and
sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's bhang is a
richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the offerer,
join in drinking. Such social and religious drinking of bhang is
common in Bombay in the temple of dauji in Kalyan Kirparam lane
near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class worship of Baladev the
liquor offering has been refined into an offering of bhang so it
is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's early and terrible consort. On
any Tuesday or Friday, the two weeks days sacred to Devi, still
more during the Navratra or Nine Nights in Ashwin or
September-October, those whose caste rules forbid liquor make a
pleasing spiced bhang. And as in the worship of Baladev all
present, worshipper and ministrant alike, join in drinking.
Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of small-pox, whose
nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling, takes pleasure in
offerings of bhang. During epidemics of small-pox the burning and
fever of the disease are soothed by pouring bhang over the image
of Shitaladevi. So for the feverishness caused by the heats
especially to the old no cure equals the drinking of bhang.
Unlike spirits the tempter to flesh bhang the craver for milk is
pleasing to the Hindu religion. Even according to the straitest
school of the objectors to stimulants, while to a high caste
Hindu the penalty for liquor-drinking is death, no penalty
attached to the use of bhang, and a single day's fast is enough
to cleanse from the coarser spirit of <i>ganja</i>. Even among
those who hold stimulants to be devil-possessed penalty and
disfavour attach to the use of hemp drugs only when they are
taken with no religious object and without observing the due
religious rites.<br>
</p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusion and elf is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides into the ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or <i>maya</i>, bhang taken religiously is kindly
thwarting the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind.<br>
</p>

<p>In this devotion to bhang, with reverence, not with the
worship, which is due to Allah alone, the North Indian Mussalman
joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the follower of the later
religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang is not the spirit of
the Almighty. It is the spirit of the great prophet Khizr or
Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to Khizr is natural. Khizr is
the patron saint of water. Still more Khizr means green, the
revered colour of the cooling water of bhang. So the Urdu poet
sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken its colour to the fresh
light down of thy youthful beard.' The prophet Khizr or the Green
prophet cries 'May the drink be pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the
great North Indian Urdu poet of the beginning of the present
century, is loud in the praises of his beloved Sabzi, the Green
one. 'Compared with bhang spirit are naught. Leave all things
thou fool, drink bhang.' From its quickening the imagination
Musalman poets honour bhang with the title <i>Warak al Khiyall</i>,
Fancy's Leaf. And the Makhzan or great Arab-Greek drug book
records many other fond names for the drug. Bhang is the
Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man's
Heaven, the Soother of Grief.<br>
</p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant smoked in ganja or drink in bhang. To its devotee
bhang is no ordinary plant that became holy from its guardian and
healing qualities. According to one account, when nectar was
produced from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to
purify the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a
nectar-cleanser by creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from
his own body, and so it is called <i>angaj</i> or body-born.
According to another account some nectar dropped to the ground
and from the ground the bhang plant sprang. It was because they
used this child of nectar or of Mahadev in agreement with
religious forms that the seers or Rishis became Siddha or one
with the deity. He who, despite the example of the Rishis, uses
no bhang shall lose his happiness in this life and in the life to
come. In the end he shall be cast into hell. The mere sight of
bhang cleanses from as much sin as a thousand horse-sacrifices or
a thousand pilgrimages. He who scandalises the user of bhang
shall suffer the torments of hell so long as the sun endures. He
who drinks bhang foolishly or for pleasure without religious
rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs</i> of sins. He who
drinks wisely and according to rule, be he ever so low, even
though his body is smeared with human ordure and urine, is Shiva.
No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of bhang. The
students of the scriptures at Benares are given bhang before they
sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, the other holy places yogis,
bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts of bhang that they may
centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To bring back to reason an
unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang leaves should be boiled
in milk and turned to clarified butter. Salamisri, saffron, and
sugar should be added and the whole eaten. Besides over the demon
of Madness bhang is Vijaya or victorious over the demons of
hunger and thirst. By the help of bhang ascetics pass days
without food or drink. The supporting power of bhang has brought
many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine. To
forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and
gracious a herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and
annoyance and to the large bands of worshipped ascetics
deep-seated anger. It would rob the people of a solace in
discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian whose gracious
protection saves them from the attacks of evil influences, and
whose mighty power makes the devotee of the Victorious,
overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic fear, of the
glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able to rest to brook
on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him body and soul,
frees him from the haunting of self and receives him into the
ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee shares to the
full. Like his Hindu brother the Mussalman fakir reveres bhang as
the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds of self. Bhang
brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank bhang and the
mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so tiny a sin.'<br>

</b></p>

<hr>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi, </i>or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the dysentery-scaring <i>bel, AE</i>gle<i> </i>marmelos, so
the properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding ascetic Mahadev. </p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangi', 'Bhangi', apparently that the sound

should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed. When they
are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due repeating of
the holy name as a <i>jap </i>or muttered charm. Then, bearing in
mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and offering a prayer,
the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and sanctified place.
Bhang so prepared, especially If prayers are said over it, will
gratify the wishes and desires of its owner. Taken in the early
morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin, frees him from the
punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him to reap the fruits
of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such sanctified bhang taken at

user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight Guardians with
clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his orders. The wish
of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due reverence over the

</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight

dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-searing and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding<i>, </i>when the bride-groom and his friends are
entertained at the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is
drunk by the guests. The Gujarat .Musalman bride before and after
marriage drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or
North Indian Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at
weddings, but the Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is
despised by his caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit
time during which bhang plays an important part is the time of
war. Before the outbreak of a war and during its progress the
Ling of Mahadev should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving
panic influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name
of Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and weariness. So the
beleaguered Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after
loosing his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance,
drinks the sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes
his <i>juhar </i>or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of
panic-scaring that makes bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious,
specially dear to Mahadev in his character of Tripur, .the slayer
of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva is fond of <i>bel </i>leaves,
as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi </i>leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond
of bhang leaves. He who wishes to obtain his desires must
constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar. </p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stncken performs the Vijaya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken pleased to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
he had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang this cure
brings to Benares sufferers from fever which no ordinary medicine
can cure. The sufferers are laid in the temple pour bhang ever
the Ling whose virtue has gained it the name Jvareshwar, the
Fever-Lord. Bombay many people sick of fever vow on recovery to
pour bhang over a Ling. Besides cure for fever bhang has many
medicinal virtues. It cools the heated blood, soothes the
over-wakeful to sleep, gives beauty,<i> </i>and secures length of
days. It cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens
digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tonic of the lisper
plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the body
and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for
which in<i> </i>his goodness the Almighty made bhang. In this
praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great Greek-Arab work on drugs
joins... Ganja in excess uses abscess, even madness. In
moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is a cordial, a bile
absorber, an appetizer, a prolonger of life. Bhang quickens
fancy, deepens thought, and Judgment. As on other
guardian-assessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or the leaf oaths
are taken on the bhang leaf Even to a truthful witness an<i> </i>oath
on of the be1 tree, dreaded. To one who forswears himself the
bhang oath is death the bhang leaf. So holy a plant must play a
leading part in temple rights. Shiva on fire with the poison
churned from the ocean was cooled by bhang. At another time
enraged with family worries the fields. The cool shade .of a
plant soothed him. He crushed and of the leaves, and the bhang
refreshed him. For these two benefits bhang is Shankarpri , the
Mahadev. So the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning
to drinker smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena
Shankar, lena Babulnath: be pleased to take Shankar, take it
Babulnath. According to the Shiva Parann, from the dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February) to the light fourteenth of
Asbadh (June-July), that is, during the three months of the hot
weather, bhang should be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva
every day, bhang should be poured at least during the first and
last days of this period. According to the Meru Tantra on any
Monday, especially on Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all
twelfths <i>pradoshs, </i>and on all dark fourteenths or <i>shivratris</i>
still more on the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February.), and at all eclipses of
the sun or moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the
world to come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the
Ling. Not every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such
rites in Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and
Babulnath temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang
offered to Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed
with water, water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over
the Ling. According to some authorities the offerer should not
touch the offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans,
Bhojaks, Bhopis, Bharadis, Gutaras alone should drink it. If
there are no ministrants the remains of the offering should be
poured into a well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities
encourage the offerer to the bhang, since by<i> </i>sipping the
bhang reaches and soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the
sipper. On certain social occasions during failures of rain,
during eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are
poured ever the Ling. </p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu Or, the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Bainram, or Dauji, the elder brother
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banins,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits instead of spirits the offering of bhang to Baladev,
unlike the special offerings to Shiva, present bhang. In Bombay,
without an offering of bhang no worship of Baladev is complete,
offerings to Shiva is a common and everyday rite. Unlike the
plain or milk and sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's
bhang is a richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the
offerer, join in drinking. Such social and religious ions
drinking of bhang is common in Bombay in the temple of Dauji in
Kalyan' Kirparam lane near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class
worship of Baladev the liquor offering has been refined into an<i>
</i>offering of bhang so it is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's
early and terrible consort. On any Tuesday or Friday, the two
week-days sacred to Devi, still more during the Navrata or Nine
Nights in Ashwin or September-October, those whose caste rules
forbid liquor make a pleasing spices bhang. And as in, the
worship of Baladev all present, worshipper and ,ministrant alike,
join in drinking. Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of
small-pox, whose nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling,
takes pleasure in offerings of bhang. During epidemics of
small-pox the burning and fever of the disease are soothed by
pouring bhang over the image of Shitaladevi. So for the
feverishness caused by the heats especially to the old no cure
equals the drinking of bhang. Unlike<i> </i>spirits the tempter
to flesh bhang the craver for milk is pleasing to the Hindu
religion. Even according to the staitest school of the objectors
to stimulants, while to a high caste Hindu the penalty for
liquor-drinking is death, no penalty attaches to the use of
bhang, and a single day's fast is enough to cleanse from the
coarser spirit of ganja. Even among those who hold stimulants to
be devil-possessed penalty and disfavor attach to the use of hemp
drugs only when they are taken with no religious object and
without observing the due religious rites. </p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusionand self is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of'knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides intothe ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or maya, bhang taken religiously is kindly thwarting
the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind. In this devotion to bhang, with reverence,
not with the worship, which is due to Allahalone, the North
Indian Mussulman joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the
follower of the later religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang
is<i> not </i>the spirit of the Almighty. Itthe spirit of the
great prophet Khizr or Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to
Khizr isnatural. Khizr is the patron saint of water. Still more
Khizr means green, the revered colour of the cooling water of
bhang. So the Urdu poet sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken
its colony to the fresh light down of thy youthful beard.' The
prophet Khizr or the Green prophet cries ' May the drink be
pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the great North Indian Urdupoet of the
beginning of the present century, is loud in the praises of his
beloved Sabzi, the Green one. 'Compared with bhang spirits are
naught. Leave all things thou fool, drink bhang.' From its
quickening the imagination Musalman poets honour bhang with the
title <i>Warak al Khiyall, Fancy's </i>Leaf. And the Makhzan or
great Arab-Greek drug book records many other fond names for the
drug. Bhang is the Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide,
the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother of Grief. </p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant. </p>

<p>smoked in ganja or drunk in bhang. To its devotee bhang is no
ordinary plant that became , holy from its guardian and healing
qualities. According to one account, when nectar was produced
from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to purify
the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a nectar-cleanser by
creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from his own body, and so
it is called <i>angaj </i>or body-born. According to another
accountsome nectar dropped to the ground and from the ground the
bhang plant sprang. It was because they used this child of nectar
or of Mahadev in agreement with religious forms that thee seers
or Hishis became Siddha or one with the deity. He who, despite
the example of the Hishis, uses no bhang shall lose his happiness
in this life and in the life to come. In the end he shall be cast
into hell. The mere sight of bhang, cleanses from as much sin as
a thousand horse-sacrifices or a thousand pilgrimages. He who
scandalizes the user of bhang shall suffer the torments of hell
so long as the sun endures. He who drinks bhang foolishly or for
pleasure without religious rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs
</i>of sins. He who drinks wisely and according to rule, be he
ever so low, even though his body is smeared with human ordure
and urine, is Shiva. No god or man is as good as the religious
drinker of bhang. The students of the scriptures at Benares are
given bhang before they sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, and
other holy places yogis, bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts
of bhang that they may Centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To
bring back to reason an unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang
leaves should be boiled in milk and turned to clarified butter.
Salamisri, saffron, and sugar should be added and the whole
eaten. Besides over the demon of Madness bhang is Vijaya or
victorious over the demons of hunger and thirst. <i>By </i>the
help of bhang ascetics pass days without food or drink. The
supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe
through. the miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously to
restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would
cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to the large bands
of worshipped ascetics deep-seated anger. It would rob the people
of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian
whose gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil
influences, and whose mighty power makes the devotee of the
Victorious, overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic
fear, of the glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able in
rest to brood on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him
body and soul, frees him from the having of self and receives him
into the ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee
shares to the full. Like his Hindu brother the Musalman fakir
reveres bhang as the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds
of self. Bhang brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank
bhang and the mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so
tiny a sin.''<br>

</p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHIILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL,. '<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin.--In </i>1867 Babu Annnda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in- law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <i>Antecedent: of the
originator.--Dhamrai </i>is an important village in the Dacca
district for its car festival, which is annually held in honour
of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur, </i>and which is
witnessed by a large gathering of people. Ananda Chandra received
education at the Dacca Normal School. After leaving school he
served for some time as a pundit (schoolmaster), and then entered
the Police Department, but was there only a short time. He is a
Barendra Brahman and belongs to a respectable family. He learnt
to smoke ganja when he was only a boy. His present age Is 60
years. He has the reputation of being a versifier. He smokes two
pice worth of ganja every day. </p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali </i>(poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (l,000 copies) was sold in
a few months. </p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first
started.-Ananda </i>Chandra Kali was at the time living in the
house of his father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the
worship of a common god, who might be worshipped by all classes,
rich and poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas,
Baishnavas, and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having
the present worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things,
such as ganja, oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used.  <br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri, </i>three, and Nath, lord) is
represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu Trinity in
one. </p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself Ananda Kali may have also thought
that by introducing the worship he would be able to save the
ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed in
the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or pious
act. </p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship.--The </i>following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela </i>Panchali
gives some idea of the subject : </p>

<p>The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the nether
world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the. universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator)declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their
desire, </p>

<p>to come to this world in one form to receive worship. . </p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper. </p>

<p><i>&quot;The </i>worship should be made in a form in which the
rich and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Only </i>three things, each worth one pice, are
required for this <i>puja </i>(form of worship).. </p>

<p>The things which please all must be selected. The offering
should consist of <i>siddhi </i>(ganja),. <i>pan </i>(betel-leaf),
and oil, each worth one pice. . </p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums
</i>with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and
reverence. When all, the worshippers are assembled the lamp
should be lit with three wicks, and the praises of Tri- should be
sung. As long as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and
his praises chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at
the close of the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali </i>is
finished, those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad (the<br>
</i>offering which has been accepted by the god), i.e., chillum
of ganja, shall be consigned to. </p>

<p>eternal hell, and the sincere worshippers shall go to heaven.
, </p>

<p><i>How the worship spread.--Anauda </i>Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca and Mymensingh
districts, and the worship soon became popular. In fact it spread
like wild-fire from one village to another among the
ganja-smokers. Those that were not in the habit of consuming
ganja also followed their example. </p>

<p>The following circumstances assisted the spread of the Worship
: </p>

<p>I.--The puja is open to all classes from Brahmans to Chandals
and to the rich and the poor. Caste does not stand in its way,
and it may be performed almost every day and in all seasons.<br>
</p>

<p>II.--The pup is a <i>Manarik Puja </i>(made in pursuance of a
vow on the fulfillment of the object desired).. People have been
led to believe that Trinath possesses the power of .healing the
sick and fulfilling desires, and .that those who. neglect his
worship meet with disgrace, while those who observe it <i>attain </i>success
in life. There are several stories m the Panchali narrated in
illustration of this statement. It is also popularly believed
that in the house where Trinath is worshipped cold: fever and
headache do not appear. </p>

<p>III.--This is a cheap form of worship. The puja can be
performed <i>by </i>even the poorest, only three pies being
required. </p>

<p>IV.--People of the lowest class can mix with those above them
without distinction of caste or creed on the occasion of these
pujas. </p>

<p>V.--Ganja eau be consumed by all in the name of a god, and the
practice cannot be looked down upon, because it is done under
certain forms and religious ceremonies. It is also popularly
believed that those who mock the worshippers of Trinath shall be
ruined and shall be the victims of misfortune. <br>
</p>

<p>The worship prevails not only among the poor, but also among
the well-to-do. The latter often entertain their friends after
the puja. </p>

<p>Women do not take any active part in the worship, but they
often listen to the reading. of the <i>Panchali.</i> </p>

<p>The worship is more or less general in the following districts
:--(1) Dacca, (2) Mymensingh, (3) Faridpur, (4) Backergunge, (5)
Noakhali, (6) Tippers, (7) Chittagong, (8) Bogra, (9) Sylhet, and
(10) Pabna (SerajgaDj side). .,, </p>

<p>The worship is on the decline. It is almost dying out among
the educated </p>

<p>]Jut among the masses it Still exists. </p>

<p>. I have ascertained the above facts from Dr. Chandra Sekhar
Kali (brother of the originator, Ananda Chandra Kali) and many
other respectable persons, and also from personal inquiries in
the Daces, Chittagong and Rajshahi divisions. <br>

<h1>THE OPIUM PROBLEM </h1>

<p><b>BY CHARLES E. TERRY AND MILDRED PELLENS</b> </p>

<p><b>1928</b> </p>

<p>CHAPTER I - EXTENT </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of individuals involved is probably what first
brings any problem to the attention of the public. It bears a
definite relationship to control and if it is demonstrated that a
problem is confined neither to a community nor to a section of
tile country, neither to one social group nor even to one race,
but is widespread and common to all, such facts should be used as
the basis for eliciting interest, for pointing out the need for
remedial measures, and for framing such measures. Likewise the
converse is true. A knowledge, therefore, of the extent of tile
problem with which we are concerned is a matter of importance and
should receive early consideration. </p>

<p>The attempts which we have made to secure an accurate estimate
of the number of chronic opium users in the United States at the
present time emphasize an unusual situation. We find estimates
varying all the way from a few thousand individuals to several
millions. One states that one hundred thousand to two hundred
thousand is the outside limit while another states that two
million or more is a conservative figure. The lay press, popular
magazines, and even scientific journals vary so widely in their
estimates of the number of sufferers from this condition that one
is justified in accepting none of them unreservedly and in
analyzing afresh all available means for the determination of the
actual facts. </p>

<p>It will be seen not only that no one is possessed of an
accurate knowledge as to the exact number of individuals
regularly using opium in this country today, but also that under
present conditions it is impossible to obtain such a figure.
There are several reasons why this is true. In the first place,
the fact that opium-using in any form is regarded by the general
public as alone a habit, vice, sign of weak will or dissipation
undoubtedly has caused the majority of users to conceal their
condition. This attitude presumably attributes to the individual
either a physical or mental inferiority the concealment of which
is quite natural. This factor applied before the problem ever
became a matter for official and legislative action and
undoubtedly became intensified when it was taken up officially
and the individuals desirous of solving it made their views the
basis of propaganda for control. With the advent of prohibitory
legislation and the consequent fear of legal involvement, it is
natural that even greater efforts were made by individuals
affected to conceal their condition. </p>

<p>Quite aside from this individual point of view is the fact
that only in cases where large doses of the drug are being
consumed can casual observation or even a fairly careful
examination determine the existence of the condition. There is a
popular belief extant that practically anyone can detect the
so-called &quot;dope fiend,&quot; that he is a miserable,
emaciated, furtive individual with pinpoint pupils, trembling
hands, sallow complexion and characterized by a varied group of
moral attributes, needing only to be observed to render
identification of the condition complete. As a matter of fact not
even one of these alleged characteristics need be present and it
is safe to say that in many cases only one or another of them
exists and by no means would suffice to give the ordinary
observer an idea of the true situation. It has been reported that
for many years husbands and wives, to say nothing of other
members of a family, have lived in complete ignorance of the
existence of this condition in one or the other and that quite
possibly the average physician, unaccustomed to dealing with the
condition, might have difficulty in determining its existence. </p>

<p>In view of what has been said it would seem quite evident that
there is no accurate knowledge as to the exact number of chronic
opium users in the country today, as it is apparent that, if the
condition is considered a physical, mental, or moral stigma and
if it is possible to conceal it from any but the most
scrutinizing examination unknown cases inevitably must exist.
This may be expected to continue as long as the present attitude
toward the user of these drugs exists with the social and
economic damage resulting from exposure, and the illicit traffic
offers a means of supply. That the illicit traffic exists to a
very marked degree we know; to suppose that the dangers of
disclosure are not appreciated by individual sufferers would be
to consider them lacking in ordinary intelligence. However, in
spite of the obvious difficulties in the way of an accurate
determination of the number of cases of chronic opium
intoxication, startling statements constantly are being made. </p>

<p>Although it is apparent that under present conditions the
difficulties in the way of arriving at exact knowledge or even an
estimate known to approach the number of opium users in the
United States are insurmountable, on a superficial examination
there would appear to be two methods available for attaining at
least a minimal figure. As it is common knowledge that opium is
not produced in this country and that therefore all opium used
must be imported, it is possible to secure through the proper
Government bureaus the quantity of opium legitimately imported.
By suitable calculations apparently it should be possible to
arrive at the total number of users, excluding those supplied by
the illicit traffic. Theoretically this could be accomplished by
subtracting from the amount imported for a given period the
amount exported and the amount used for therapeutic purposes not
connected with chronic opium intoxication and dividing the
resulting figure by the average amount consumed by the chronic
user for that period. This method has been used by some authors,
but there are several factors which vitiate the totals arrived
at. First, some writers have neglected to distinguish between
general importation figures and the figures dealing with
importations for consumption.* This at once makes for very
different totals as will be seen when it is stated that, for the
period of ten years 1911-1920 inclusive, these amounts differed
by about 400,000 pounds of opium. </p>

<p>*'General imports&quot; embrace imported articles entered at
the customs houses for immediate consumption and imported
articles entered for warehouse. &quot;Imports entered for
consumption&quot; embrace imported articles entered for immediate
consumption and imported articles withdrawn from warehouse for
consumption. </p>

<p>Another source of error enters in any attempt to allow for the
amount of opium and its derivatives employed for therapeutic
purposes not connected with chronic, opium intoxication. The
estimates as to the proportion of imported drug required for such
purposes have varied very widely and obviously where such large
figures are dealt with the resulting estimates vary considerably.
These allowances always seem to have been reached either in an
arbitrary fashion or upon a basis of incomplete facts. </p>

<p>Further so far as we know there has been made no study of a
sufficiently large and representative number of individual cases
under suitable conditions to permit of any definite statement as
to an average daily dose. For instance, it is well known that
certain cases continue for years on one or two grains or even a
fraction of a grain daily while others take such almost
unbelievable doses as eighty to one hundred or more grains a day.
Also, among a certain type, the amount stated as habitually
consumed by an individual may include the ration of one or more
other individuals unknown to the investigator. </p>

<p>As far as we know then there are two obstacles to the
determination through importation figures of a minimal figure for
the number of chronic opium users in this country at the present
time:-(1) the fact that the so-called &quot;legitimate
therapeutic needs&quot; are unknown and (2) the wholly
speculative nature of the &quot;average dose.&quot; In view of
these facts, all estimates as to the extent of this condition
based on importation figures however used are potentially
fallacious to such a great degree as to be practically valueless.
</p>

<p>The second method of determination is the employment of some
means for the taking of a census of opium users in a given
locality and adjusting it to the population of the country as a
whole. Aside from the fact that it would not include those users
who, by reason of their desire for concealment and consequent
dependence on illicit traffic for supply, could not be recorded
by<font size="1"> </font>such a survey undoubtedly would possess
a value not found in estimates based on importation figures in an
attempt to reach a minimal figure, inasmuch as it would be
definite and positive as far as it went. Of course, there is
possibility of error to a greater or less degree in this method.
The floating population, for example, cannot be disregarded, yet
this is a source of error common to every method of
census-taking. Further, local conditions such as population
composition, climate, race distribution, occupation, etc., are
influencing factors which tend to lessen the value of the
individual surveys as applied to the country as a whole.
Unfortunately, there have not been enough of these surveys made
in various sections to determine by comparison the degree to
which these factors operate. In what follows, the surveys which
we have reviewed and which represent investigations made in
different localities at different periods will be analyzed and
the features which tend to vitiate their application to the
country as a whole, for the period in which they were made, will
be pointed out. </p>

<p>'This factor does not enter into the early surveys which were
carried on when illicit traffic was unknown or practically
negligible. <br>
</p>

<p>Before examining the first definite figures of which we have
knowledge, contained in a survey reported by 0. Marshall in the
Annual Report of the Michigan State Department of Health of 1878,
it will be interesting to quote from some of the earliest authors
who refer to the extent of chronic opium intoxication in this
country. Their statements, however inexact, at least show that
the problem is by no means one of recent development but the
result, as we know it today, of a continuous growth probably
since Colonial days. What effect the war of the American
Revolution and that of 1812 had upon its spread we have not seen
indicated in any record we have consulted, but that the Civil War
gave it a considerable impetus seems definitely established.<br>

<p>&quot;The habit is gaining fearful ground among our
professional men, the operatives in our mills, our weary serving
women, our fagged clerks, our former liquor drunkards, our very
day laborers, who a generation ago took gin. All our classes from
the highest to the lowest are yearly increasing their consumption
of the drug.&quot; </p>

<p>Horace Day-1868 <font size="1">.4 </font></p>

<p>4 Day, Horace-The Opium Habit. 1868. </p>

<p>&quot;The number of confirmed opium-eaters in the United
States is large, not less, judging from the testimony of
druggists in all parts of the country as well as from other
sources, than eighty to one hundred thousand . . . The events of
the last few years (Civil War) have unquestionably added greatly
to their number. Maimed and shattered survivors from a hundred
battlefields, diseased and disabled soldiers released from
hostile prisons, anguished and hopeless wives and mothers, made
so by the slaughter of those who were dearest to them, have
found, many of them, temporary relief from their sufferings in
opium.&quot; </p>

<p>Alonzo Calkins-1871.5 </p>

<p>Calkins calls attention to the increased use of opium in this
country from the year 1840. Basing his computations on the
importations of opium and the population figures for those years,
he reaches the following ratios of advance:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="op100001.gif" align="bottom" width="444" height="71">
</p>

<p>He gives in some detail the method by which he reaches these
figures which include &quot;a comparison of opinions given by
eighteen prominent apothecaries of New York City.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Such statistics,&quot; he asserts, &quot;fully presented
bear no equivocal interpretation.&quot; </p>

<p>Independent and collateral evidences, he believes, show that
&quot;opiummania, far from being restricted . . . to our cities .
. . is fast pervading the country-populations.&quot; </p>

<p>In the evidence he presents he quotes the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>&quot;Thus addresses </i>the writer, a physician and
    druggist of a New England city, Dr. S. S.: 'In this town I
    began business twenty years since. The population then at
    10,000 has increased only inconsiderably, but my sales have
    advanced from 50 pounds of opium the first year to 300 pounds
    now; and of laudanum four times upon what was formerly
    required. About 50 regular purchasers come to my shop, and as
    many more, perhaps, are divided among the other three
    apothecaries in the place. Some country dealers also have
    their quotas of dependents.' Such is no solitary record. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In the <i>Portland Press, </i>IM, a correspondent
    sounds the alarm-note in these words: 'Very few of our people
    are aware how many habitual consumers of opium among us a
    careful scrutiny would disclose. In the little village of
    Auburn (of the neighborhood) at least fifty such (as counted
    up by a resident apothecary) regularly purchase their
    supplies hereabouts; and the country grocers, too, not a few
    of them, find occasion for keeping themselves supplied with a
    stock.' Corroborative accounts dome in from New Jersey and
    Indiana, from Boston at one extreme and from St. Louis at
    another, and from the impoverished South as well. In the
    Mississippi Valley particularly the use of stimuli of every
    name is fearfully on the increase (Pitcher, Comstock).&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>F. E. Oliver-1871.<br>
</p>

<p>In the third Annual Report of the State Board of Health,
Massachusetts, for the year 1871, there appears a chapter on the
use and abuse of opium written by this author. The writer
addressed the following questions to the physicians of
Massachusetts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Are preparations of opium used by the people except for
    the relief of Pain? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. We would like to know whether the injurious use of
    opium has increased of late years, and if so, the causes of
    such increase? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, these questions were not so framed as to elicit
the information which the author desired to obtain and, as he
himself states, the data secured are most incomplete although
suggestive. Less than one-half of the physicians addressed were
heard from, representing a little more than one-third of the
physicians of the state. In all 125 physicians replied, 40 of
these stating in answer to the first question that they knew of
no case of opium eating. The remaining 85 stated that the drug
was used to a greater or less extent in their respective
circuits. In many of the smaller towns where the
&quot;habit&quot; existed, the number of users was reported where
it could be ascertained, while in the returns from others such
terms as &quot;few,&quot; &quot;many&quot; and
&quot;several&quot; alone were given. In others again no mention
was made of numbers, so that the author was not able to arrive at
anything like an accurate computation. From the fragmentary data
so obtained the author states that the inference is unavoidable
that the &quot;opium habit&quot; is more or less prevalent in
many parts of the state and while it is impossible to estimate it
the number of users must be very considerable. </p>

<p>The writer further gives the following extract from a letter
received from Mr. S. Dana Hayes, one of the State Assayers: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;'In reply to your inquiries, it is my opinion that
    the consumption of opium in Massachusetts and New England is
    increasing more rapidly in proportion than the population.
    There are so many channels through which the drug may be
    brought into the State, that I suppose it would be almost
    impossible to determine how much foreign opium is used here;
    but it may easily be shown that the home production increases
    every year. Opium has been recently made from white poppies,
    cultivated for the purpose, in Vermont, New Hampshire and
    Connecticut, the annual production being estimated by
    hundreds of pounds, and this has generally been absorbed in
    the communities where it is made. It has also been brought
    here from Florida and Louisiana, while comparatively large
    quantities are regularly sent east from California and
    Arizona, where its cultivation is becoming an important
    branch of industry, ten acres of poppies being said to yield,
    in Arizona, twelve hundred pounds of opium.&quot;' <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;'That which is not used where it is produced,
    including the shipments from California and the West,
    together with inferior and damaged parcels of foreign opium
    received and condemned at this port, is sent to Philadelphia,
    where it is converted into morphis. and its salts, and is
    thus distributed through the country! <font size="1">Pt a</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his letter Hayes comments further on the use of opium and
morphin in family remedies such as cough mixtures and liniments
and in the dangerous so-called &quot;cures&quot; or &quot;Relief
for Opium-Eaters&quot; preparations. </p>

<p>'D. M. R. Culbreth in his &quot;Materia Medica and
Pharmacology&quot;, 3rd edition, 1903, states: </p>

<p>&quot;During the Civil War opium was cultivated in Virginia,
Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, being planted in September
and collected in May.&quot; </p>

<p>In the 6th edition of the same work the author states that
this opium was of high narcotic content. </p>

<p>Oliver also quotes extracts from letters replying to his
question as to the increase in tile <i>use </i>of opium, some of
which are reproduced below: </p>

<p>&quot;Clarksburg-'I think it on the increase, because doctors
prescribe it more indiscriminately now than formerly, thus
establishing the habit with the patient! </p>

<p>Eastham-2 I think the use of opium has slightly increased,
mostly among females.' </p>

<p>Swampscott-2 The use of opium in its various forms has
materially increased within the last ten years! </p>

<p>Westfield---I have reason to believe this practice exceedingly
common among certain classes of people, who crave the effect of a
stimulant, but will not risk their reputation for temperance by
taking alcoholic beverages.' </p>

<p>Worcester-2 I have talked with some of our most intelligent
apothecaries, who tell me that the use of opium has greatly
increased, especially among women. The reasons which one gave are
these: The doctors are prescribing it more to their patients, and
thus the habit is acquired. There is also the desire for Some
form of stimulant. Alcoholic stimulants being prohibited, many
have resorted to the use of opium.' </p>

<p>Another gave it as his opinion that 'the use of opium in its
various preparations is increasing among the people as a
stimulant, and is now being used to an alarming extent. I believe
this to be due largely to the unpopularity and restricted use of
alcoholic liquors. I believe there is a natural craving for some
artificial stimulant with almost every human being, which is
greatly increased by the cares and perplexities of life, and
therefore is more apparent as age advances. This desire should be
satisfied by the milder and least injurious drinks, as beer,
light wines, etc.' </p>

<p>Another states: 'I think opium and its preparation are used to
a considerable extent as stimulants, and am inclined to the
opinion that such use is increasing and that such increase is
due, in some degree, to the excitements, suffering and mental
disquietude resulting from the late war! </p>

<p>Boston-Among 20 or 30 druggists consulted there was a
diversity of opinions many of them not selling opium without a
physician's order. The following statements are among the most
important: </p>

<p>'Believes the habit of opium eating diminishing, as he has
fewer calls than formerly! </p>

<p>'Has one customer who buys half an ounce at a time. The number
of calls is less than formerly. Has observed that veteran
soldiers who contracted the habit in army hospitals are still
addicted to opium.' </p>

<p>'In the experience of twenty-five years has observed no
decided increase in the habit of opium eating. Recognizes the
correlation in the abuse of opium and of alcohol. The opium habit
frequently begins in the use of opium medicinally. Veteran
soldiers, as a class, are addicted to it . . . ' </p>

<p>'Thinks the abuse is not uncommon in the community but that it
is les,9 in Boston than elsewhere. Would look for it rather among
professional men threat among the poorer classes.' </p>

<p>'From his own experiences, believes that the habit of opium
eating has increased within the last five years from 50 to 75 per
cent. Never sells the drug without physician's prescription but
has on an average five or six daily applications for some one of
its preparations. It is largely taken by prostitutes.' 'Has but
one customer and that a noted temperance lecturer.' </p>

<p>S. F. McFarland-1877.7 </p>

<p>' McFarland, S. F.-Opium inebriety and the hypodermic syringe.
Trans. New York State Medical Society, 1877. </p>

<p>&quot;If cases of opium inebriety occur as frequently in the
private practice of other physicians as they have in my own, it
is coining to be a serious matter, and a few words of caution,
against the indiscriminate use of so active a drug, may be
pardonable. </p>

<p>&quot;Since the introduction of the hypodermic syringe,
especially, there has been a noticeable increase in the
frequency, as well as the severity, of these cases; and I wish to
enter a protest against its imprudent use, and particularly
against leaving it in the hands of patients or their friends, to
be used at their discretion, or even allowing them to know that
they can use it, except in the greatest emergencies; for once in
their possession, and used for any considerable length of time,
they will seldom discontinue it, and will soon be inquiring where
they can get 'one of those things'. It is certainly a most
valuable instrument in the hands of the discreet practitioner,
and will reach cases which nothing else will, with a certainty
and promptness which is very satisfactory; but it is too potent
for evil, as well, to be trusted beyond his grasp. </p>

<p>&quot;By the hypodermic use of opium the habit is much more
rapidly produced than by taking it into the stomach, or by any
other method-a fact which should not be lost sight of.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>0. Marshall-1878.8<br>
'Marshall, O. The opium habit in Michigan. Annual Report Michigan
State Board of Health. 1878. </p>

<p>Turning to a consideration of the early surveys, the one
already mentioned by 0. Marshall deserves first consideration, as
it was the earliest of which we have knowledge. While these
figures are obviously quite incomplete, they represent at least a
minimal extent and apparently can be depended upon as comprising
positive information as far as they go. For these reasons they
are of great importance to us today in seeking to arrive at a
true conception, first, of the probable influence of factors
other than illicit traffic and, second, of their possible
relationship to conditions of today. </p>

<p>Marshall begins his report with the following paragraph: </p>

<p>&quot;At a meeting of the State Board of Health in January,
1877, by a written communication, I called its attention to the
large number of opium-eaters in the vicinity of North Lansing,
giving many particulars relating to the opium habit as it exists
here. In complying with the request of the Board to prepare an
article for publication, I have extended the investigation to
other parts of the State, the result of which investigation is
here given.&quot; </p>

<p>From further observations the author realizes how impossible
it is to obtain complete and perfectly reliable information
concerning this condition. He states: </p>

<p>&quot;Those beat acquainted with its extent are the physician
and druggist. As a rule, the physician, although originally
responsible for many of the cases in his vicinity, is only aware
of them through his business relation with the druggist. The
latter, from whom the drug is obtained, from the fear of low of
trade, or, as some of them term it, a violation of confidential
business, are often unwilling to furnish any information with
regard to it.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall sent two hundred circulars to prominent physicians
throughout the state asking for information in regard to the
opium &quot;habit&quot; in their localities and enclosing a
postal card with printed form for report of the number of men and
women using opium and morphin in each place. Marshall took care
to eliminate duplication of cases by addressing only one
physician in each locality and where reports from a physician
included figures from two or more druggists the lists were
compared and repeaters eliminated. To those, ninety-six replies
were received giving the number of morphin and opium users in
ninety-six cities, villages, and townships of the state. He says
in this connection: </p>

<p>&quot;From the supposed impossibility of getting reliable
information of the numbers in the larger cities, no circulars
were sent to Detroit, Grand Rapids or East Saginaw; and probably
from this cause no answers were received from many of the larger
cities of the State where circulars were sent.&quot; </p>

<p>The majority of the reports received by him include only those
persons with whom the physician personally was acquainted. This,
he points out, resulted in obtaining less complete information
than had the druggists themselves been addressed. This, he says,
is noticeable in the reports from two neighboring cities, one of
which gives the large number of one hundred sixteen, which number
was obtained after considerable effort by particular request,
while the other reports only one case. A druggist, however,
formerly in business in the latter city estimated the number of
opium users in that city at not less than sixty. From such facts
as these Marshall comes to the conclusion that only the minimal
number was obtained and that the actual number was probably
greater in many instances.<br>
<br>
We are including the complete table given in Marshall's report.
It is of peculiar interest because of the fact that urban, rural
and semirural communities were included and that the larger
cities of the state, in which the underworld and vicious element
naturally would be supposed to exist in the greatest degree, were
absent. The assumption therefore is that, whatever the cause for
the original use of the drug, the influence of vicious
association was relatively negligible. It is significant that
throughout his whole report no mention is made of illicit traffic
or of any source of supply other than that through physician and
druggist. </p>

<p>Marshall summarizes his findings as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The total number of opium caters reported in the places
given is 1313; of these 803 are females, and 510 are males ...
The population of the cities and villages including the townships
in which they are situated, according to the State census of
1874, was 225,633. The population of the whole State at the same
time was 1,334,031. If the number of opium eaters, including
morphine eaters, in proportion to the population in the places
given holds good for the entire State, the total number of opium
caters, all classes, in the State would be 7,763. Taking every
degree of the habit into consideration, this estimate of the
number is probably not too large.&quot; </p>

<p>The smallest community from which figures were obtained had a
population of but 315, the largest a population of 10,235, the
average population of the 96 towns being 2350. In other words,
whatever the prevalence of the use of narcotic drugs obtained by
Marshall was, his facts were derived from small hamlets and towns
which scarcely could be dignified by the name of city even in the
time in which he wrote. These communities covered every section
of the state and presumably gave a true picture of it as a whole.
Obviously, as alreadk stated, underworld influences such as
prostitution, gambling, etc., largely can be eliminated. At the
time of this investigation communication was much more difficult
and less rapid than it is today; news was not so widely
disseminated and in an area of such an extent as that of the
state of Michigan, one must conclude that a situation of this
nature was caused by factors of common occurrence, by influences
shared alike by all communities rather than by artificial or
unusual influences operating in selected localities. If,
therefore, we find that Marshall's figures were based on
representative conditions common to all sections of the state, it
is reasonable to assume that they may be applied also to the
country as a whole. We may not assume, for instance, that the
distribution of painful disease, of insomnia, of nervousness, or
even of certain social proclivities and curiosity was peculiar to
Michigan and that in 1877 through some mischance its people, more
than those of other states, were subjected to pernicious
influences of this nature. Nor may we assume that the practice of
medicine was conducted along widely different lines in Michigan
from those elsewhere or that the druggists of Michigan were more
careless in the conduct of their business, less prone to make a
profitable sale or more blind to the harm resulting from this
traffic than those of other states. In other words, there would
seem no valid reason for not applying to the country as a whole
such figures as Marshall gives us in depicting the extent of
chronic opium intoxication in his state. Also the resulting
estimate for the country would be a minimal figure not only
because of the incompleteness of Marshall's returns but also
because of the absence in Michigan of certain influences which
would tend to increase the use of opium. At that time, as we know
from other sources, there were operating on both the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts influences that did not operate in Michigan, an
inland state. On the west coast there were such influences as the
maritime traffic with the Orient and the coolie labor imported
for railroad and other construction undertakings, while in New
England we have already seen poppy culture already was being
indulged in and shipments were being made to other states.<br>

<p><img src="op100003.gif" align="bottom" width="452"
height="479"> </p>

<p>As a<b> </b>preliminary to the application of Marshall's
figures to the State of Michigan as a<b> </b>whole, three things
must be borne in mind-first, the total omission of returns from
the larger cities, second, the fact which he himself brings out,
that information secured from the stated source, namely,
physicians, was less complete than would have been information
secured from druggists, and, third, the use by Marshall of
population figures for the year 1874 instead of 1877. </p>

<p>From the ninety-six communities heard from, as we have seen,
there were reported 1313 users of opium or morphin. For some
unknown reason Marshall employs in his computation the state
census figures of 1874 rather than an estimated figure for the
year 1877 in which the survey was made. The population of
Michigan, according to him, was in 1874, 1,334,031. Employing
this figure he comes to the conclusion that if the number of
opium and morphin users holds good for the entire state the total
number in the state would be 7,763. Taking into account the
natural rate of increase in population between the years 1874 and
1877, this figure would represent a slight overestimate, all
other things being equal. However, this is offset by other
factors such as the relative incompleteness of the information
received from physicians as compared with that received from
druggists and it is fair to assume that this is a<b> </b>minimal
figure. How great the error on the side of underestimation is, we
have no means of telling. </p>

<p>The fact that in one town, Monroe, the physician addressed
reported but one case while <b>a </b>druggist stated that there
were about sixty, is indicative possibly of a very great error in
Marshall's total figure and it must be remembered that the
druggists were in a much better position to know the truth than
were physicians. They supplied the drugs used and as a rule,
especially at the time of Marshall's investigation when counter
sales were legal and a matter of common practice, physicians were
called upon only by those opiate users seeking curative treatment
for their condition. It is, therefore, doubtful if the medical
profession at any time has been in a position to supply anything
like a complete list of these cases while the druggists from the
very nature of things in the past could have furnished this
information. </p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that Marshall's figures are very
much more incomplete than even he himself believed and it is
quite possible that the actual number of cases in the towns and
cities of Michigan from which Marshall received his returns were
several times larger than his figures indicated. Be this as it
may, his total of 1313 cases represents definite and positive
information indicative of the widespread use of these drugs in
the State of Michigan over fifty years ago, long before the
development of an illicit traffic in opium and its preparations
with its resulting artificial impetus to the formation of new
cases. If applied to the country as a whole for the year in
question, 1874, this figure gives a total of 251,936. This is a
startling figure for the period in question and yet in all
probability well below the actual one and deserving of the most
careful consideration on the part of those who today, with the
undoubted existence of new and increasingly powerful factors at
work in the stimulation of the use of these drugs, seek to become
familiar with the extent of our present narcotic problem. </p>

<p>Further on in his report, Marshall introduces the importation
figures from 1850 to 1877. From these he estimates an average
importation figure for the year 1877. From information secured
from drug store sales he comes to the conclusion that the average
user consumes about three pounds of opium during the year.
Allowing one-fifth of the total importation for &quot;legitimate
therapeutic use&quot; and dividing the remainder by three he
arrives at a figure of 93,654 as the number of users in the
country as a whole. From this figure by suitable calculation he
obtains for the State of Michigan about 25.50 users. </p>

<p>Elsewhere we have pointed out some of the dangers of
calculating the number of users upon such a basis as this and in
Marshall's effort we have a good illustration of the fallacies
that enter. If we take Marshall's figure of 2550 for the State of
Michigan we obtain, as the proportion of the ninety-six towns and
cities from which lie received definite information as to the
number of opium users, the figure of 421 or but one-third of the
actual number of users positively known to exist in these
ninety-six communities. It is quite evident that in (Calculations
based on importation figures there enter very large errors which
it is impossible to determine or correct. It seems, therefore, we
repeat, that little or no dependence can be placed on estimates
arrived at in this manner and that fragmentary as have been the
various actual surveys they furnish data of far greater value for
purposes of generalization. </p>

<p>C. W. Earle-1880.9 </p>

<p>'Earle, C. W.-Tile opium habit. Chicago Med. Rev. 1880. </p>

<p>Earle made a study of the extent of the use of opium in
Chicago by interviewing a number of druggists in that city.
Although the figure of the number of users he obtained may not be
used in a statistical analysis, his work is a distinct
contribution as an indication of the prevalence of the use of the
drug at the time. The following is a quotation from his report: </p>

<p>&quot;In an article entitled 'The Impending Danger,' Dr.
Mattison, of Brooklyn, states that he is assured by both dealers
in the crude drug and manufacturers of the alkaloids, that
importation of opium is increasing rapidly every year, and that
the supply may become insufficient for the demand. The question
naturally suggesting itself is: What becomes of the vast amount
yearly brought to our shores?&quot; </p>

<p>Earle investigated fifty drug stores, asking questions as to
the number of customers, their age, nativity, kind of narcotic
used, quantity, etc. He reports: </p>

<p>&quot;The three divisions of the city were visited, and
localities inhabited by the different classes and nationalities
were thoroughly canvassed. I was greatly surprised to find that
druggists on the West Side were patronized to a greater extent
(excepting a few on Clark Street) than in any other part of the
city. Foreign druggists (German and Scandinavian), seem to
exhibit more conscientious scruples in regard to the trade than
our own nationality. I learned from some of these gentlemen that
in Denmark, and, if I mistake not, in Norway and Sweden, the
trade is absolutely forbidden. Fifty druggists have 235
customers, or an average of nearly five to each store.&quot; </p>

<p>J. M. Hull-1885. </p>

<p>An account of Hull's findings appears in the Biennial Report
of the State Board of Health of Iowa for 1985. This Biennial
Report covers a period of two years ending June 30, 1885, and it
is not quite clear from his article whether the investigation was
made in the latter half of 1883, during 1884 or in the first half
of 1885. In using his figures, therefore, we shall choose the
middle period and base our computations on the population figures
of 1884. </p>

<p>Hull begins his report with the following: </p>

<p>&quot;Although my paper on the opium habit is brief, and but a
small part of the sad story told, yet I am inclined to believe it
contains some facts regarding this rapidly increasing evil that
cannot fail to astonish even those who are well informed, and far
more those who have given the subject little or no attention. </p>

<p>&quot;Opium is today a greater curse than alcohol, and justly
claims a large number of helpless victims, which have not come
from the ranks of reckless men and fallen women, but the majority
of them are to be found among the educated and most honored and
useful members of society; and as to sex, we may count out the
prostitutes so much given to this vice, and still find females
far ahead so far as numbers are concerned. The habit in a vast
majority of cases is first formed by the unpardonable
carelessness of physicians, who are often too fond of using a
little syringe, or of relieving every ache and pain by the
administration of an opiate.&quot; </p>

<p>To fifteen hundred circulars sent to druggists in the state of
Iowa, requesting information on the subject, Hull received 123
replies reporting 235 users of opium in some form. Of these 86
were men and 129 women.10 The form of drug used was morphin, 129;
gum opium, 73; laudanum, 12; paregoric, 6; Dover's Powder, 3;
McMunn's Elixir, 4. As to the method of using the drug he states:
</p>

<p>&quot;While the drug is used less frequently by the hypodermic
method than by the mouth, the former method is gaining ground.
The habit may be formed about as readily one way as the other.
Those who use it by the mouth as a rule make the most rapid
progress, as the drug is easier taken, is free from pain, and
larger than the hypodermic dose.&quot; </p>

<p>He states that there were about 3,000 stores in Iowa where
opium was kept for sale and that if reports had come from all in
the same ratio it would have shown the number of users to have
been about 6,000. By actual computation on the above basis we get
5,732. Hull states, however, that his reports were mostly from
the small villages, very few coming from the cities where, he
states, the &quot;habit&quot; was far more common. He states
further: </p>

<p>&quot;From reliable information which I have been able to
secure from various sources, I feel safe in saying that there are
in this state over 10,000 people who are constantly under the
influence of an opiate and who are wholly unable by any effort of
the will to break the habit or even to abstain for 72
hours.&quot; </p>

<p>The estimated population of continental United States for 1884
was according to the U. S. Bureau of the Census 55,379,154 and
that of the State of Iowa for the same year was 1,742,084. </p>

<p>Using the lower figure of 5,732 obtained in the manner
described above, as<b> </b>the actual number of users in the
State of Iowa, we get 182,215<b> </b>chronic users for the
country as a whole for the year 1884. This must be by far an
underestimate as Hull himself states that he had good reason to
believe that there were over 10,000 in the state. </p>

<p>In considering estimates based on Hull's figure several points
should be borne in mind. First, Hull does not indicate the
population served by the 123<b> </b>stores reporting the 235
cases. Although he does state that there were about 3,000 stores
in Iowa where opium was kept, in assuming that the sales averaged
the same in different stores, there is the possibility of error.
Second, according to Hull's own statement most of the cases
reported were from small villages with very few coming from the
cities, where he states the &quot;habit&quot; was far more
common. With the usual vicious elements of city life eliminated,
one may assume that Hull's figures represent a minimal extent. </p>

<p>It is worthy of note that here again no mention is made of
illicit traffic. </p>

<p>B. H. Hartwell-1888.11 </p>

<p>' Hartwell, B. H. The sale and Use of Opium in Massachusetts.
Annual Report, Massachusetts State Board of Health, 1889.<br>
Hartwell made a<b> </b>survey in the State of Massachusetts, in
the report of which, unfortunately, he failed to give the
population figures on which the study was based. If these figures
were available it might be possible to compute the per capita
consumption. Although this cannot be done, we are giving below a
summary of that part of his survey dealing with extent as an
interesting side-light on conditions obtaining in that period. </p>

<p>Hartwell states that the investigation was undertaken in
accordance with the following &quot;resolve&quot; adopted by the
Legislature of 1888: </p>

<p>&quot;Resolved, That the State Board of Health be requested to
make an investigation concerning the sale and use of opium, in
various forms and preparations, with a view to ascertaining the
extent of the evils arising therefrom; whether such use and evils
are increasing, and, if so, the manner and cause thereof, and
what remedies for such evils may be proposed; and to report the
result of such investigation to the General Court.&quot; </p>

<p>Hartwell continues his report as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;This resolution was presumably an outcome of the
prevalent belief that the use of opium is increasing very
rapidly. An expos6 of the opium joints in Boston appeared in one
of the leading dailies in 1885; there have been frequent
allusions to the habit in other papers; a recent article,
claiming to be the result of years of study of the opium habit in
Boston, was published in one of our popular magazines, in which
the writer says that the habit 'is increasing rapidly! In these
and numerous other ways the public has been taught to believe
that the evil is widespread and extending. The large number of
opium habitues which seem to be among us, the novelty of this
form of stimulation, its secret character, the strong hold which
it has upon its victims, the horrible results arising therefrom,
especially from the habit of opium smoking,-all tend to keep the
subject prominently before the people, and to magnify the evil in
the public mind. To get at the facts concerning the use of opium
(the term opium will include all of its preparations), as far as
possible, is the object aimed at in this inquiry. This is beset
with many difficulties, from the very nature of things. There can
be no reliable statistics of the amount of opium used by the
medical profession, the laity, or by habitues, or the proportion
used by each. The most rigid inquiry into a habit as secret and
as easily practised as is this form of inebriety could not be
sufficiently accurate for mathematical calculation; approximation
only can be attained. </p>

<p>&quot;That a great deal of opium is used besides that
legitimately required for the relief of pain and treatment of
disease, is unquestionably true. The unwillingness of people to
bear pain, the habit of self-prescribing, the many facilities for
obtaining opium and its preparations from the regular dealers as
well as by means of proprietary medicines containing it, the
numerous ways by which a knowledge is gained of the method of
obtaining and taking the drug-all extend its use in the most
dangerous manner. </p>

<p>&quot;As the best means for forming an opinion of the amount
of opium used, and whether or not its use is increasing,
circulars were sent to many of the druggists and physicians of
the State; the questions asked and a synopsis of the answers
returned are given below. Some allowance must be made in
considering the returns, for the reason that opium habitues, from
fear of detection or a desire for secrecy, scatter their
purchases as much as possible; so that a druggist may easily get
an impression of an increased or decreased use of the drug, while
in reality the sales are going on elsewhere or have returned
after the rounds have been completed. So also the same habitual
users might be seen by different physicians, and counted several
times, or escape notice altogether, and thus convey a false idea
of the actual number. A circular containing five questions was
sent to druggists. Replies were received from about 600
druggists, representing 190 cities and towns, and embracing
nearly every city and town in the State where a druggist is
located. (There are about 150 towns in which no druggists
reside.) About one-fourth of the answers came from Boston, the
rest from other parts of that State. Many of the returned
circulars contained answers to all of the questions, others to
only part of them; hence the number varies in the different
questions. The questions and answers were as follows:- </p>

<p>&quot;I. What amounts of opium are sold by you per month, not
on the advice and prescription of a physician?&quot; </p>

<p>The answers numbering 512 to 541 showed the following: </p>

<p>(a) Crude opium, opium in pill or other solid form? </p>

<p>Sixty per cent. none-the remainder a few pills to 4 pounds. </p>

<p>(b) Liquid preparations; Tincture? </p>

<p>Twelve per cent. none; the remainder one gram to 32 pints;
other liquid preparations none to 40 pints. </p>

<p>(c) Morphia and its salts, in bulk, pill or powder? </p>

<p>Thirty-three per cent. none; the remainder % gr. to 8 oz.
morphia 2 to 500 morphia pills, mostly 1/8 grs. </p>

<p>(d) Other preparations very little. </p>

<p>&quot;2. Is the demand for opium and its salts increasing? 535
answers: 85 per cent., no; 8 per cent., yes; 5 per cent.,
decreasing; 2 per cent., do not know.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;For obvious reasons, circulars were also sent to many of
the physicians of the State who commenced practice before 1875.
About 260 replies were received, from 100 cities and towns out of
about 250 in which physicians reside. Eight questions were
submitted, which with the number and character of the answers,
were as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;1. From your own observation, is the use of opium and
its preparations increasing in the community in which you live?
225 answers: 66 per cent., no; 28 per cent., yes; 6 per cent., do
not know. </p>

<p>&quot;2. If such be the case, what is the probable cause of
such increase; this question called for answers only from those
who had answered the first question affirmatively; consequently,
but 75 of a miscellaneous character were received. Twenty per
cent., give the use of opium by physicians as the sole cause; 11
per cent., give this as the cause in part. Ease of obtaining
opium from druggists, duplication of prescriptions containing
opium, increased knowledge of its effects, excessive brain work,
desire for stimulation, fast living, comprise most of the
remaining answers. </p>

<p>&quot;3. Are diseases calling for the use of opium increasing?
209 answers: 84 per cent., no; 16 per cent., yes.&quot; </p>

<p>Although he believes, as can be seen from the above, that a
great deal of opium &quot;is used besides that legitimately
required for the relief of pain and the treatment of
disease,&quot; on the basis of his study, Hartwell concludes that
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot; </font>. . . the use of opium is not
increasing in Massachusetts. In the large centres of population
there may be a slight increase from year to year. It is here that
excesses and crime of all kinds, if not increasing, are much more
common than in less populous districts. The better knowledge of
the uses and effects of the drug, by means of the greater
intercommunication of the people; the many facilities for
obtaining it; the general practice of writing prescriptions,
followed by unrestrained reduplication of them; the excitement of
business, leading to overwork and overtaxing of the mental
powers,-are conditions which are favorable to the increased use
of opium.&quot; </p>

<p>A. P. Ginnell-1900.12 </p>

<p>'Grinnell, A. P.-A review of drug consumption and alcohol as
found in proprietary medicine. Med. Leg. Jour., 1905.<br>
This author made a study of the consumption of drugs in the State
of Vermont and while he made no attempt to estimate the number of
opium users from it, a report of his study is interesting as an
indication of the use in Vermont at that time. There appears to
be no reason to believe that this report covers a community
influenced by any unusual factors but rather it represents a
normal distribution of drug users. </p>

<p>The author states: </p>

<p>&quot;Few people are aware of the enormous consumption of
narcotics or stimulating drugs. With the development of
pharmaceutical science and the consequent improvement and
facility in preparing drugs and alkaloids the market has grown
accordingly. More widespread knowledge concerning the effects and
special uses of opium, cocaine, quinine, Cannabis Indica, Chloral
and Heroin, ha's further stimulated the demand for these drugs,
until today the American people are confronted by a problem which
is only equaled in its magnitude by its terrible and appalling
aspects. </p>

<p>&quot;When we pause to consider the fearful inroads the
excessive and habitual use of these drugs make on the mentality,
physical health and general existence of those addicted to them,
we can easily appreciate what a serious menace to society a rapid
increase of drug habitues must inevitably mean. </p>

<p>&quot;It is hardly necessary to speak of the results of the
habitual and excessive use of narcotic drugs. Physicians, more
than any other class, realize the fearful ravages made on the
human system; and the large number of physical, moral and mental
wrecks they are constantly meeting who owe their condition
entirely to drug addiction, tells eloquently how extensive and
far-reaching the drug evil has become. Every alienist is daily
being brought face to face with the growing influence of certain
drugs on psychic abnormalities and degenerations, and the
insidious onset and progress of such conditions, when so
produced, cannot fail to impress us with the Medico-Legal
importance of the drug habit.&quot; </p>

<p>In order to secure information as to the consumption of
certain drugs, Grinnell wrote the druggists of the State asking
them for estimates of their monthly sales of the following drugs
and preparations: </p>

<p>&quot;Opium (gum or powder) </p>

<p>Morphine sulp. (powder or pills) </p>

<p>Dover powder </p>

<p>Paregoric (tinct. opii. camph.) </p>

<p>Laudanuin (tinct. opii) </p>

<p>Cocaine </p>

<p>Chloral </p>

<p>Indian hemp (Cannabis Indica) </p>

<p>Quinine (powder or pills)?&quot; </p>

<p>Of 130 druggists addressed 116 were heard from. He also
addressed 172 general stores which sold drugs in localities where
no drug stores existed and three wholesale druggists, but
obtained no satisfactory information from the latter. </p>

<p>He states that ninety per cent. of the physicians of Vermont
dispense their own drugs and that sales of these drugs to
physicians were not included in the figures supplied by
druggists. </p>

<p>He also states that the figures he secured could be multiplied
by five and be below the actual consumption inasmuch as they
include &quot;nothing in the composition of patent medicines or
cough medicines; nothing dispensed by physicians; nothing
dispensed by these three large manufactories-simply the regular
retail drug store businesses and the sales of the 160 general
stores.&quot; </p>

<p>From these two sources lie estimated 3,300,000 doses of opium
were sold every month-enough to supply &quot;one and one-half
doses of opium to every man and woman in the State of Vermont
above the age of 21 years, every day in the year.&quot; </p>

<p>The actual amounts sold by druggists as compiled by Grinnell
were as follows: </p>

<p>The above figures cover reports from 69 out of 344 towns, and
from 116 drug stores out of 130, but do not include amounts sold
in the general stores. </p>

</p>

<p>A committee of this organization, H. F. Hynson, Chairman,
reported on the replies received from pharmacists and physicians
in certain localities in response to queries sent by the
committee. The conclusion arrived at was to the effect that at
least five users of certain drugs, commonly known as
&quot;habit-forming&quot; but not opium alone, were known to
every pharmacist. From this it was estimated that there were at
least 200,000 in the country. </p>

<p>'Hynson, H. P.-Report of Committee on Acquirement of the Drug
Habit. Amer. Jour. Pharm. November, 1902. </p>

<p>In the following year the same Committee with E. G. Eberle as
chairman made a more extensive canvass of the situation through
letters to all sections of the United States and Canada. As a
result of the information so gathered, which dealt with cocaine
and other drugs as well as opium preparations, the Committee came
to certain conclusions, the most suggestive of which follow: </p>

<p>Eberle, E. G. Report of Committee on Acquirement of Drug
Habits. Amer. Jour. Pharm. October, 1903. </p>

<p>&quot;General reports indicate that the sale of narcotics is
not restricted to any section of the country, nor confined
exclusively to the fallen and lower class. Information comes from
several sources that in callings which demand many hours' work at
a time or the hours of night, cocaine is resorted to for
stimulation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We are confident that the use of narcotics is increasing
and that evil effects from it will come to succeeding
generations. While the increase is most evident with the lower
classes, the statistics of institutes devoted to the cure of
habitues show that their patients are principally drawn from
those in the higher walks of life.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Careful study of data personally collected and from
reliable sources forces the conclusion that the habitual use of
opium in its various forms is increasing and that this increase
is confined to no one class or occupation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;While it has not been practicable to obtain exact
figures, it can be stated that the drug habit is alarmingly
increasing among the men of our army and navy. The number of men
using opium in the army has greatly increased since the
occupation of the Philippines, many 'opium smokers' acquiring the
habit there from Chinese or natives. The smoking of opium by the
men of the navy does not seem to be as prevalent as in the army,
gum opium 'pills' or morphine being the way in which the drug is
mostly used by sailors. Quite a number of enlisted men have been
discharged from both army and navy during the last year because
of their being detected as habitual users of opium or
morphine-probably several hundred per cent. more during the last
five years than for any ten years previous. To the best of the
writers knowledge-and he has carefully inquired into facts
-practically all the cases of drug habitues in both army and navy
arise from the men learning the habit from natives of foreign
countries or from lewd women and men in this country. Not a
single case of drug habit coming from the prescribing of an
opiate by a medical officer can be recalled, opium and allied
drugs being very guardedly and carefully used by army and navy
medical officers. A goodly percentage of the cases are men who
have acquired some drug habit prior to enlistment while a few-sad
to say-are from men of the hospital corps who drifted into the
habit from constant opportunity and handling of the baneful drug.
</p>

<p>&quot;At the present, it is calculated that there are over a
million opium smokers in the United States, the importation of
opium for smoking purposes being double that for medicinal uses,
amounting to more than 500,000 pounds last year, valued at
$3,000,000 1 &quot; </p>

<p>1 -C. E. Terry-1913.15<br>
'Terry, C. E.-Annual Report Board of Health, Jacksonville, Fla.,
1013, </p>

<p>In 1913 Terry, Health Officer of Jacksonville, Florida,
collected data relating to the extent of the problem in his city.
The figures were not dependent upon voluntary cooperation as in
the case of previous collections of such material, but were
secured through the operation of a local law which required,
besides the usual prohibition of sale of opium preparations by
druggists without physicians' prescriptions and the keeping of
records of all sales, two procedures which resulted in bringing
to the health office specific information relating to the extent
to which opium preparations were employed. The first of these
required physicians writing prescriptions containing more than
three grains of morphin or its equivalent in alkaloids or salts
of alkaloids of opium to send to the office of the health
department copies of such prescriptions together with the names
and addresses of the individuals for whom they were intended.
Second, it provided that the city health officer or other
physician in the employ of the city designated by him might give
to any user, upon the furnishing of satisfactory evidence of
habitual use, a prescription for as much of such drug as might be
deemed expedient. </p>

<p>Records were kept of all duplicate prescriptions sent in and
of all those issued at the health office. These prescriptions
were free and were designed to remove from druggists the
temptation of making counter sales on the plea that indigent
users or those of small means could not afford to pay for the
writing of a prescription in addition to the cost of the drug.
The law was enforced actively and both druggists and physicians
were watched carefully for violations. </p>

<p>No effort was made at this time to limit the use of these
drugs in the case of habitual users nor were they subjected to
such treatment as might be calculated to discourage them from
coming to the health department for a prescription. On the
contrary, during the operation of this law-a period of over two
years-they were supplied upon application. Treatment was offered
them from time to time and furnished to such as accepted the
offer. </p>

<p>Through the operation of this law there were recorded at the
health office during the year 1913, 541 persons using opium or
some preparation thereof or about .81 per cent. of the population
of Jacksonville. These were divided into 228 men and 313 women.
Of the men 188 were white and 40 colored; of the women 219 white
and 94 colored. The population of Jacksonville for 1913 as
estimated by the U. S. Bureau of the Census was 67,209. Of this
number 32,998 were whites and 34,211 colored. Applied to
continental United States on the basis of the estimated
population for 1913 of 97,163,330, the Jacksonville incidence
gives as the total for the country 782,118. </p>

<p>In interpreting these figures, however, it should be borne in
mind that while the percentage of whites using opium in
Jacksonville is much greater than that of blacks, the black
population in Jacksonville is very high compared to that of the
country as a whole. If, as is indicated by the Jacksonville
figures, the white race is more prone to use opium than the
negro, suitable correction will be necessary in generalizing from
the Jacksonville figures. As will be seen later, this same
predilection of the whites appears in Brown's figures of the
Tennessee studies. These two studies, however, are not sufficient
in our judgment to assume the establishment of such racial
tendencies as many other factors quite possibly may have
influenced these findings. </p>

<p>If, however, such racial tendencies as the Jacksonville and
Tennessee findings seem to indicate do exist, then in computing
the distribution of opium use in the country as a whole it will
be necessary to correct for the different race distribution
existing in Jacksonville as compared with continental United
States by applying the figures obtained in Jacksonville to the
white and black populations separately. </p>

<p>In 1913, the white population of continental United States was
86,580,278 and colored 10,583,052. Applying the Jacksonville
figures to the country as a whole, therefore, we get 1,109,340
total opium using population. This naturally is a larger figure
than the original crude figure of 782,118. </p>

<p>One source of possible error in figures of this kind exists in
the increase which may take place over the normal population of
users through the registration of transients. In the case of
Jacksonville, however, it would not seem that this was a large
factor inasmuch as the registration required either through
application to the health office or through the sending of
duplicate prescriptions by physicians was not required in nearby
states and cities at that time so that it was more difficult for
strangers to obtain the drug in Jacksonville than in other nearby
points. Whatever this error was, however, it is very much more
than offset by the omissions in registration which occurred in
the following ways. It was known to the health officer, for
instance, that certain business and professional men and other
individuals in high social standing who used the drug were never
registered but secured their supplies either by mail order from
distant points or through friendly physicians or druggists who
were willing to risk violating the law for them. Others through
the nature of their employment in drug stores or drug
manufacturing concerns were able easily to supply themselves,
while still others went to nearby points outside of the city
limits and hence beyond the operation of the ordinance to secure
their supply. </p>

<p>What part differences in race composition (other than negro),
economic, occupational and other sociologic factors may have
played in vitiating the Jacksonville figures for purposes of
generalization no one is in position to say at the present time,
as enough studies of the prevalence of this condition in other
sections of the country have not been made to justify claims
either for or against the existence of such influencing factors.
In view, however, of the facilities at hand for the collection of
the Jacksonville data, it is believed that they represent very
complete information. As in a consideration of Marshall's figures
for Michigan, it may be assumed that the distribution of painful
maladies and the methods of medical practice in Jacksonville did
not differ widely from those of other sections. In 1913, however,
the influence of prostitution and what is generally termed the
underworld obtained much more prominently in Jacksonville than in
the localities of Michigan with which Marshall's figures deal as
these were, it will be remembered, all small towns and villages.
In the case of the Jacksonville figures, therefore, we may assume
that the influence of vicious association was a more marked
factor than in the Michigan figures. </p>

<p>The illicit traffic in these drugs was practically negligible
in Jacksonville in 1913. One or two peddlers, it is true,
supplied certain women in the restricted district more as a
matter of convenience to these customers than because of any
large profits involved. The traffic could not have been lucrative
as free prescriptions were available to any user asking for them
and the price of the drug in the drug stores was in the
neighborhood of 60 cents for a drachra of morphin when sold in
original bottles or large fractions. With this price it is
evident that peddlers could not compete with profit. </p>

<p>Lucius P. Brown-1915.16 </p>

<p>' Brown, L. P.-Enforcement of the Tennessee Anti-Narcotic Law.
Amer. J. of Public Health, 1915, Vol. 5, No. 4. </p>

<p>Brown, the State Food and Drugs Commissioner of Tennessee,
reported on the results of the enforcement of the Tennessee
Anti-Narcotic Law passed in 1913. The law provided for the
refilling of prescriptions for persons using opium products
habitually &quot;in order to minimize suffering among this
unfortunate class, and to keep the traffic in the drug from
getting into underground and hidden channels.&quot; The law
provided that upon application to the Secretary of the State
Board of Health and the Pure Food and Drugs Inspector and upon
presentation of a certificate from the attending physician, the
name and address of the druggist and certain other data, an
individual might be granted permission to have a prescription for
an opium product refilled. This system brought a considerable
mass of data to the officials concerned. It should be noted in
explanation that an effort was made at every renewal of permit to
lessen the amount of the drug allowed. </p>

<p>After twelve months of operation there were on January 1,
1915, 2370 individuals registered under this system in the state
of Tennessee. Of these 784 were men and 1586 women. </p>

<p>In commenting on the accuracy of the registration Brown
states: </p>

<p>&quot;As to what proportion of the total addicts of Tennessee
are registered under this permissive system, guesses only can be
given. It seems safe to say that not over one-half of the addict
population is registered-possibly not over one fourth. Taking,
however, the lower figure, it would appear that there are in the
neighborhood of 5,000 addicts in Tennessee. The state has about
2.3 per cent. of the whole population of the United States. It is
an agricultural state, and consequently, living conditions appear
to be not so exhausting as in more thickly settled communities,
nor life as a rule, so intense. In order to get the whole number
in the United States, we may multiply our figure of 5,000 by 43.
This gives us about 215,000 addicts. Probably, however, in order
to allow for conditions in cities and, industrial communities, we
ought to add 25 per cent. to this number, giving not less than
269,000 addicts in the whole United States. In my opinion this is
a very conservative calculation. It shows by no means so many as
sensational writers appear to want us to believe, and while it
thus shows better conditions it is bad enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Brown points out that according to figures which he believes
to be fairly accurate not over ten per cent. of the cases were
colored. He says: </p>

<p>&quot;This is due in part to the fact that the average negro
avoids as far as possible any contact with an official, and to
the fact that the negro appears to use relatively less morphine,
and more cocaine than the white man.&quot; </p>

<p>This agrees with the race distribution in Jacksonville. If we
should take Brown's estimate of 5000 cases and distribute them
according to what he believes to be a race incidence actually
existing, namely 9070 white and 1070 negroes, we should reach a
different total for the country from that reached by Brown.
Making this correction and applying, on the basis of Brown's
estimate for Tennessee, the race incidence obtaining to the
country as a whole, we get 221,818 white users and 11,518 black
users or 233,336 as a total in the United States for 1913. If we
now add, as Brown suggests, 2517c &quot;in order to allow for
conditions in cities and industrial communities,&quot; we obtain
a total of 291,670 for the United States. Whether or not this
correction should be made has already been considered in our
discussion of the Jacksonville figures. We give it for what it is
worth with no claim that the race distribution of opium use in
these two localities typifies racial characteristics. </p>

<p>Such a generalization from the Tennessee figures indicates a
very much smaller total for the country than is obtained on the
basis of the Jacksonville figures, although these two
investigations were made within a year of each other. The
territory covered by the Tennessee law was very much larger than
in the case of Jacksonville and the machinery for enforcement
doubtless was less adequate. In Jacksonville, it must be
remembered, every physician and every druggist personally was
known to the health officer as were most of the opium users and
it is to be expected that on these accounts more complete
information could be secured than where, for the most part as in
the case of Tennessee, it was necessary to rely on correspondence
without the close personal touch possible in the smaller
territory. Brown himself questions the completeness of his
figures, stating that in his opinion they comprise a very
conservative estimate. </p>

<p>Which of these estimates is nearer the truth for the period in
question no one may state with certainty. It is noteworthy,
however, that Brown's figures applied to the country as a whole
give a figure but little in excess of that obtained on the basis
of the Michigan figures of 1877, about thirty-five years before
Brown's work. It scarcely is to be expected that with the
influences at work, which we shall note in the next chapter,
during this period of thirty-five years, there could have failed
to be a greater increase than is indicated by these two sets of
figures. </p>

<p>The estimates resulting from studies heretofore quoted
represent conditions of opium usage freer from artificial
influences of one kind or another than any that have been or will
be compiled dealing with later periods. Prior to this time there
was no federal law relating to the distribution of the drug and
but very few state laws which were at all rigidly enforced, so
that peddling of the drugs was not a marked factor in extending
their use. The usual causes mentioned, such as the employment of
opium and its products in medicine and self-prescribing for the
relief of pain and discomfort, the effect of education through
ill-considered articles in the lay press and magazines, fiction,
vicious or ignorant associations, and the influence of natural
tendencies to dissipation or to seek refuge under stress and
strain, were operating alone without the additional stimulation
of the illicit traffic which was a later development. Wherever,
therefore, the exact truth lies as to the number of chronic opium
users in the United States prior to the passage of the Harrison
Narcotic Act it represents what might be termed the normal for
the United States in contradistinction to an artificial or
fortuitous figure resulting in addition to the forementioned
causes from the perniciously active propaganda of the commercial
trader in opium preparations. </p>

Investigation appointed March 25, 1918, by the Secretary of the
Treasury, June, 1919. Washington. 1919. </p>

<p>This Committee was unable to determine the exact number of
addicts in the United States, 'owing, as stated in the Report,
&quot;to the lack of laws and regulations making it compulsory
for the registration of addicts throughout the country or the
keeping of any records as to their identity.&quot; </p>

<p>The Committee believed, however, that a fairly accurate
estimate of their number can be made from the information which
it has obtained. </p>

<p>One source of information was a questionnaire addressed to all
physicians registered under the Harrison Narcotic Act, requesting
data as to the number of chronic users under treatment by them at
the time. The Committee reports as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Replies were received from approximately 30 2/3 per cent
of the physicians registered in the different States, and these
showed that there were under treatment at that time a total of
73,150 addicts. On the basis of 100 per cent replies, if the same
average was maintained, there were under treatment at the time
this questionnaire was sent out a total of 237,655 addicts. The
following table&quot; shows in detail by States the number of
addicts reported under treatment, the percentage of replies
received from physicians, and the estimated number on the basis
of 100 per cent replies.&quot; </p>

<p>Another questionnaire was addressed to state, district, county
and municipal health officers, the results of which are given as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Questionnaire No. 4 was addressed to 3,023 State,
district, county and municipal health officers. To this
questionnaire 983 replies were received, or 33 per cent of the
total number sent out. Only 777 of these, or 26 per cent of the
total, contained any information of value to the committee.&quot;
</p>

<p>The Report summarizes as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The number of addicts reported by the health officials
replying to questionnaire No. 4 was 105,887. As this number
represents the addicts reported by only 26 per cent of the health
officials, from which this information was requested, it may be
assumed that had all the health officials replied the total
number would have amounted to approximately 420,000. This number,
however, appears to be much too low, in view of the fact that the
physicians of the country are estimated to have had about 237,000
addicts under treatment during this same period, and only a small
portion of the total number of addicts present themselves for
treatment. Addicts of the &quot;underworld,&quot; for instance,
secure most of their supply through illicit channels and rarely,
if ever, consult a physician. </p>

<p><img src="op100005.gif" align="bottom" width="495"
height="681"> </p>

<p>&quot;It appears that a more accurate estimate of the total
number of addicts may be obtained from the data secured by those
investigators who have made an intensive study of drug addiction
in certain restricted communities. For example, the health
officer of Jacksonville, Fla., reported 887 1 addicts in that
city in 1913. This number represents 1.31 per cent of the
population. Upon this basis the total number of addicts in the
United States, in 1918, taking the estimated population as
106,000,000 would be 1,388,600. </p>

<p>&quot;In reply to questionnaire No. 4 sent to health officers
of States, counties, and municipalities, the health officer of
New York City reported a total of 103,000 addicts, which is
equivalent to 1.8 per cent of the population. On this basis,
there would be 1,9W,000 addicts in the United States. </p>

<p>&quot;Information in the hands of the committee indicates that
drug addiction is less prevalent in rural communities than in
cities or in congested centers. It would, therefore, be unfair to
estimate the number of addicts in the entire country on the basis
of the figures obtained for New York City. Furthermore, it is the
opinion of the committee that an estimate based on the number of
addicts in a small city like Jacksonville, Fla., would not be
representative for the entire country. Taking these facts into
consideration, the committee is of the opinion that the total
number of addicts in this country probably exceeds 1,000,000 at
the present time.&quot; </p>

<p>' This figure includes 346 cocaine users. </p>

<p>In reviewing the estimates arrived at on the basis of the
replies received to these questionnaires, there arises a question
as to what is meant by &quot;treatment.&quot; From a later
statement in the Report &quot;treatment&quot; here means
presumably the supplying of the drug by physicians, but we
believe that in replying to this question the average physician
would report only such cases as were under curative treatment. Be
this as it may, the propriety of estimating the number of cases
on the basis of 100% replies from physicians registered under the
Harrison Narcotic Act is open to question. It is stated in the
Report that thirty and two-thirds per cent. of the registered
physicians queried replied and that 73,150 cases were reported by
them as being under treatment. To assume that the resulting
figure of 237,655 calculated on -such a basis is a correct
estimate, is still not warranted. For such an estimate to be
accepted as a logical conclusion on the basis of 100% replies 'it
would have to be assumed that all groups of physicians registered
under the Harrison Narcotic Law answered in like proportion. But
it is natural to assume that nose and throat specialists,
oculists, obstetricians, gynecologists, surgeons and others not
occupied with general practice would not be interested to the
same degree in replying to the questionnaire. In all probability
the thirty and two-thirds per cent. physicians reporting include
a relatively greater proportion of those treating addiction cases
than those not reporting. Under these conditions the estimated
237,655 addicts is too high a figure. As a matter of fact,
however, the Committee appears not to accept this figure, anyway,
inasmuch as it ultimately reaches a speculative figure of
1,000,000, inclusive of cocaine users. </p>

<p>As to the estimates based on replies received from state,
county and municipal health officers of which the Committee
states only twenty six per cent. replied, we would call attention
to the fact that 103,000 were reported by the health commissioner
of New York City, with a balance of the twenty-six per cent.
reporting only 2887. This material was gathered in 1918. At that
time also nothing in the nature of a survey of chronic opium
users in New York City had been made. The narcotic clinic was not
opened until 1919 and this clinic disclosed but 7464 cases of
opium users. It is manifest therefore that the 103,000 reported
by the health commissioner in the previous year was wholly
speculative. It is also of interest to note that the health
commissioner of New York City a year or two later stated that
20,000 was an outside estimate for cases of chronic opium users
in New York City. </p>

<p>Here again, however, the Committee admits dissatisfaction with
the resulting estimate of 420,000, stating that the figure is too
low and ultimately arrives at an approximate figure of 1,000,000
including users of cocain. It is not apparent in the Report how
this figure is reached. </p>

<p>New York City Health Department Narcotic Clinic-April, 1919,
to January, 1920. </p>

<p>'Hubbard, S. D@The New York City Narcotic Clinic and differing
points of view on narcotic addiction. Monthly Bulletin, Dept. of
Health, City of New York, February 1920. </p>

<p>Hubbard 21 reports on the findings resulting from the data
gathered during the operation of this clinic over a period of
approximately nine months. This clinic was conducted in
co-operation with the New York State Department of Narcotic Drug
Control. In regard to the extent of opium usage in New York City,
Hubbard states: </p>

<p>&quot;The problem of narcotic addiction has been in the public
eye for some time, and the differing points of view regarding
narcotic addiction have been provocative of some very interesting
discussion. </p>

<p>&quot;In the Spring of last year, the Federal authorities
having made several raids on trafficking physicians and
druggists, an acute emergency was created whereby it was feared
by some that a panic of these miserable unfortunates would ensue.
These conditions caused the New York City Department of Health to
open a narcotic relief clinic in order to study and examine into
the subject of narcotic drug addiction. </p>

<p>Number of Drug Addicts in New York City </p>

<p>&quot;Many opinions regarding the prevalence and frequency of
drug addiction have been expressed. No doubt many of these
statements are far from true. We do not know who the addicts are,
nor how many there are of them, either here or elsewhere in this
country. Why? From opinions expressed, and from the literature on
this subject, we have been led to believe that addiction was
allocated with certain definite physical stigmata; pallor,
emaciation, nervousness, apprehension, sniffing, needle puncture
markings, and tattoo skin evidences; but in actual experience
with hundreds of acknowledged drug addicts, persons actually
seeking their drug supply, we find, like the weather indications,
all such signs failing. </p>

<p>&quot;There are drug addicts constitutionally inferior, and
superior; feeble-minded, and strong-minded; physically below, and
above par; morally inferior, and superior. No one class of
society seems, in our experience, to enjoy a monopoly in this
practice. Our opinions, therefore regarding the number of drug
addicts, here and elsewhere about this country, have very
naturally had to be revised. While it was the current opinion to
think that they existed in vast numbers estimated by some as one
per cent. of the community, and even two and three per cent by
others--we, today, think that this is greatly over-estimated. </p>

<p>&quot;It was formerly held that drug addiction was so general
and so frequent that if the law-the Harrison Act-was enforced, as
it should be, a panic would be created by the immense numbers of
addicts who would seek relief. </p>

<p>&quot;The efforts of the New York City Department of Health,
actuated and urged by the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Royal S.
Copeland, showed that this fear of the production of a panic was
a false one. Our efforts were given wide publicity, and the
co-operation of medical and scientific societies earnestly and
zealously sought to help solve this problem. It might be added
also that the raids initiated by the Federal
authorities--arresting illicit prescribers and
dispensers-together with the New York State Narcotic Commission
requiring registration of all addicts in this locality, have not
occasioned any undue excitement among these individuals. We,
naturally, must infer that the enormous number of drug addicts
supposed to exist, in this vicinity at least (and it was supposed
to be greater here than anywhere else) are mythical and untrue
and that therefore the fear of a panic of these miserable
unfortunates was negative.&quot; </p>

<p>In his conclusion, Hubbard states: </p>

<p>&quot;The estimate of 1% of our population addicted to the use
of narcotic indulgence as a habit-addiction-is very likely
greatly exaggerated.&quot; </p>

<p>In his general statistics Hubbard gives as the number of users
registered during the operation of the clinic (about nine
months), 7464 of which 5882 were men and 1582 were women.
Applying the incidence indicated for New York City by the number
registered at the clinic, we obtain for the country as a whole
140,554 for the year 1919. </p>

<p>A number of factors combined to make the registration at the
New York City clinic incomplete. In the first place attendance
was voluntary. Further in New York City it was required that not
more than a twenty-four hour supply be furnished the addict, so
that it was necessary for individuals to visit their physicians
or the clinic daily in order to secure the drug legitimately.
This requirement tended to influence those for whom it was
impossible or too inconvenient to leave their business or work to
seek their supply from the illicit traffic or from legitimate
sources outside of the jurisdiction of this ruling. The number
registered, therefore, represents only those who, because of
difficulties in securing their supply by reason of the cost of
prescriptions or because the drug was sold more cheaply at the
clinic than at the retail drug store in spite of the twenty-four
hour ruling chose to attend the clinic. </p>

<p>Also there were several other factors operating, to keep
certain classes of users away from the clinic. First there was
the inconvenience of the crowded condition of the clinic where
applicants were required to stand outside in lines a block or
more long in any weather waiting their turn to be examined and
otherwise attended to. Second, there was the fixing of an
arbitrary dosage and then the enforced reduction by an arbitrary
amount. Third, it was required that a considerable amount of
personal information having nothing to do with their addiction,
such its the name of their employers and their addresses, be
supplied and that the photograph of the patient be attached to
the registration card. </p>

<p>Drug peddling in New York City was very rife at the time of
the operation of the clinic, and every opportunity was offered
those who could afford to pay the prices charged by the illicit
traffickers in drugs to secure their supplies without submitting
to the requirements of the twenty-four hour supply provisions or
registration at the clinic. </p>

<p>Narcotic Drug Control Commission-New York-1920 .22 </p>

<p>'Second Report of the Narcotic Control Commission. 1920. </p>

<p>Referring to the number of users in New York State,
Commissioner Herrick says: </p>

<p>&quot;I think a safe and conservative approximation would be
39,000. The records of the Department show in round numbers
13,000 registered addicts. This number is composed of those who
obtain habit-forming drugs through legitimate sources, that is,
directly from a doctor or on prescriptions issued by a doctor,
filled by a druggist, or from the different clinics established
throughout the State. To these figures should be added twice the
number, which is an approximation of the users who obtain drugs
from peddlers, or other illicit sources. Of course, this latter
figure, as I have stated, is only an approximation. I base it on
the percentage of addicts among the great number with whom I have
personally conferred, who have admitted that they obtained their
drugs from peddlers or other illicit sources. Between four-fifths
and two-thirds of the registered addicts are located in the city
of Greater New York, and the remaining fraction is scattered
throughout the rest of the State. The larger the center of
population the greater the percentage of addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>When applied to the country as a whole, Herrick's estimate of
39,000 addicts in New York State yields a figure of 396,978. </p>

<p>If Commissioner Herrick's statement that between four-fifths
and two-thirds of the registered users were located in the city
of Greater New York is correct, we have from 10,400 to 8,666 in
the Greater City by using his figure of &quot;in round numbers
13,000&quot; for the state as a whole or several thousand more
than were registered at the clinic. </p>

<p>It should be pointed out that however far Hubbard's figure
falls short of the actual number of users in New York by reason
of the forementioned factors, it is at least 500 too low if our
interpretation of the Commissioner's report is correct. According
to his statement, the Department of Narcotic Drug Control issued
exemptions for certain individuals who were not required to
register. The number of these exemptions was 500 in the
beginning, but later was reduced to 300. In attempting to
generalize, therefore, from the New York City clinic figures we
must bear in mind the apparently marked incompleteness of these
figures. The figure of 7,464 however, as a minimum, is a figure
of importance and of itself presents a serious problem, however
far it may come from indicating the actual conditions. </p>

<p>Los Angeles Clinic-1920. </p>

<p>In Los Angeles a narcotic clinic was operated from March 8 to
August 17, 1920-a period of a little over five months-at which
time, according to the report of the medical head, W. H. Bucher,
the clinic was closed by federal orders. During this brief period
there were registered at the clinic 582 persons-389 men and 193
women. In addition, knowledge was had of 37 individuals who were
not registered and given the drug because they were not working,
had previous undesirable records or gave insufficient evidence of
being chronic users. The exact number, therefore, of users was
unknown to the clinic authorities. In the case of Los Angeles as
in New York all opium users were not required to come to the
clinic and register nor were records kept of cases handled by
outside physicians. Another factor which tended to influence the
situation in Los Angeles and which did not obtain in like degree
in other localities where clinics were operated was the proximity
of this city to Mexico. Tile constant smuggling of the drug
furnished easy sources of supply to those who wished to avoid
registration at the clinic. </p>

<p>Taking, however, the Los Angeles figures as indicated by the
clinic registration for what they are worth, we find at least a
minimum of 564 known chronic opium users, giving an incidence
rate of about .1 70'. On the basis of the Los Angeles figure
there would be in the United States a total of 102,005 for 1920.
It will also be remembered that the Los Angeles clinic was in
operation for but five months, while in Jacksonville and
Tennessee registration of narcotic users covered a much longer
period. </p>

<p>'In using the phrase &quot;normal incidence&quot; as
indicating the cases of chronic opium usage caused through
medical practice, self-medication and constitutional make-up but
exclusive of cases stimulated by such artificial influences as
underworld association, illicit traffic, etc., we would not be
understood as meaning that the normal as at present existing is
an irreducible figure. We believe only that it is an actual
figure existing as of this time-the present period in medical
practice and lay knowledge-that with better medical education and
a more widespread dissemination among the laity of the facts of
chronic opium intoxication this &quot;normal&quot; in the future
materially will be lessened.<br>
</p>

<p>Shreveport, Louisiana, Clinic-1919-1923. </p>

<p>In many respects the next figures to be considered possess a
unique value. They were supplied by W. P. Butler, medical
director of the narcotic clinic at Shreveport, Louisiana, and
include the cases of chronic opium intoxication in the city of
Shreveport and Caddo Parish in which Shreveport is located,
comprising thus a territory including both urban and rural
population. Further they represent only resident cases.
Transients, non-residents or those who were induced possibly to
seek Shreveport because of the opportunity for attending a clinic
and profiting by treatment have all been eliminated by Dr. Butler
through his intimate personal knowledge of the circumstances
surrounding each case. The size of Shreveport, its relative
isolation from populous centres, the absence of large industries
and manufactories would all tend to minimize underworld
influences as etiologic factors of importance. For the most part
these cases represent those arising from the prescribing of these
drugs by physicians, from self-medication and that element which
everywhere, even without unusual opportunity or artificial
incitement, tends to seek adventure, stimulation or solace
through the use of narcotics. In other words, Butler's figures
represent more nearly than any others in our possession what
might be termed a normal incidence 23as existing in a community
where unusual exciting causes have not existed. </p>

<p>Further it should be remembered in considering these figures
that the operation of this clinic continued without interruption
for a period of nearly four years, from May 3, 1919, to February
10, 1923. This is a longer period of existence than has been
comprised in the life of any other narcotic clinic. The methods
employed by Butler, differing in several particulars from those
employed elsewhere in similar work and the support from local
officials, physicians and public combined to make this unusual
period of existence possible in view of the attitude of the
Bureau of Internal Revenue in regard to the operation of narcotic
clinics. </p>

<p>The local educational influence of the clinic undoubtedly was
very great in Shreveport and the adjoining rural districts, which
fact must not be lost sight of in attempting to generalize from
the Shreveport figures. Not only the very great majority of all
cases were handled personally by Dr. Butler and his staff-only a
very few remained in the hands of private physicians-but the
nature of the work was so thoroughly understood and so widely
endorsed by the local medical profession that it could not have
failed to have a deterrent effect upon the ill-advised, careless
or unnecessary prescribing and administering of opium
preparations in the ordinary practice of medicine. Therefore,
there must have been an influence during the operation of the
clinic tending to lessen rather than to increase the number of
new cases usually arising from and attributable to the unwise use
of opium by the practicing physician at large. In other words,
there appear to have been no artificial stimulating influences
toward narcotism but, on the contrary, there were present
influences which tended distinctly to lessen the formation of new
cases. </p>

<p>Also it should be noted that . during the operation of the
clinic the illicit traffic was reduced to the minimum if not
wholly eradicated. This matter received the particular attention
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue whose agents repeatedly visited
Shreveport and noted the conditions under which the clinic
operated. According to Butler, they stated to him as their
personal opinion that the drug was very scarce on the streets of
Shreveport; one agent made several attempts at different times to
buy the drug or to have it bought, but was unsuccessful. </p>

<p>It would-appear, therefore, that one may generalize with less
chance of error, at least on the side of exaggeration, from the
Shreveport figures than from those of any other locality. Further
in such generalizations we have a more nearly accurate portrayal
of the extent of the use of opium preparations in this country
arising from what we may term the more natural causes,-causes
inherent in all communities in which medicine is practiced,
painful illness is experienced and predisposing constitutional
tendencies do not exist in excess or are not influenced unduly by
artificial conditions-than in other generalizations. </p>

<p>In other communities, especially in the metropolitan centres
and industrial cities where racial, social and economic factors
lead to congested living conditions and tend to stimulate the
vicious employment of opium preparations for purposes solely of
dissipation, where prostitution is considerably more prevalent
and where peddling is highly profitable, we should expect a very
material increase in the underworld or vicious element among the
drug-using population as a whole. In addition to this, where
public and professional attention has not been continuously and
for a relatively long period directed at constructive effort
toward the elimination of this evil, we should not look for <i>n </i>decrease
in the drug-using population resulting from an increased caution
on the part of members of the medical profession. Whatever the
effect of these two influences in the causation of chronic opium
intoxication in such large centres as we have referred to here or
elsewhere, the cases attributable to them must be considered as
an increment in excess of those normally existing in these
communities and resulting from such widespread and omnipresent
causes as those apparently responsible and chiefly operative in
Shreveport. </p>

<p>The Shreveport incidence, therefore, of opium users for the
population at large may well be considered a minimum. </p>

<p>Had Butler not eliminated the non-resident and transient
cases, the cases recorded at the Shreveport clinic since its
inception would be 1,237. This figure, Dr. Butler states,
includes transients, residents, non-residents, and all those
dispensed to one time or more and comprises all cases handled by
the clinic from the date of its opening to February, 1923. In the
case of Shreveport, however, where the collection of information
has been made with unusual care and over a considerable period,
it has been possible for those in charge of the work to eliminate
artificial or unusual conditions and to determine with exactness
the true resident incidence. Butler reports this figure to be
371, which covers exclusively those residents registered and
cared for during a period of nearly four years. This figure,
however, cannot be used for the determination of the addiction
incidence in Shreveport, and for purposes of comparison with
other surveys for three reasons: First, it covers a period of
more than one year, while in the Tennessee, Jacksonville, Los
Angeles and other figures heretofore considered the numbers dealt
with surveys made during one calendar year; second, the figure is
a strictly resident figure, whereas the figures of the other
cities deal with the crude population; third, in Shreveport the
narcotic clinic and the hospital facilities for treatment
undoubtedly attracted addicts from other sections of the country,
as the figure of 1,237 given above indicates. Therefore, Doctor
Butler has supplied us with the number of addicts treated and
registered during one calendar year of the clinic, 1920. The
total number of cases treated in this year was 542, but into this
figure enters the error incident to the fact that numbers of
individuals came to Shreveport throughout the period of the
clinic because of the clinic and its facilities. In an attempt to
correct for this source of error, it was possible for Doctor
Butler to subdivide these 542 cases into residents and
non-residents, the basis for the former being residence in Caddo
Parish for a period of one year prior to registration at the
clinic. The resident figure for 1920 is 211, the non-resident
figure is 331. None of these figures unfortunately permits of
comparison with the figures dealing with addiction incidence in
other communities, inasmuch as these latter figures have included
the general run of population usually present in a community,
residents and transients, but they did not include-and there was
no reason why they should include-individuals especially
attracted because of a local situation having to do with the
special handling of opium addicts. The true number which would be
typical of Shreveport lies somewhere between the strict resident
figure of 211 and the exaggerated figure of 642. The resident
figure gives to Shreveport an opium user rate of .25%. Applied to
continental United States it would furnish a total of 264,276 for
1920. From what already has been said of the conditions under
which the Shreveport figures were obtained-the elimination of
non-residents, transients, drug traffickers-and from the absence
of unusual exciting causes which would<b> </b>lead to the
formation of any considerable percentage of vicious or underworld
cases, it is at once apparent that this figure represents a
minimum and must be considerably below the real number. For we
may not minimize without danger of serious underestimation what,
is so often reported by local and federal authorities throughout
the country as a powerful influence in the causation of this
condition in the younger age groups of both sexes, particularly
of males, namely, the etiologic factor comprised in under-world
associations and the instinct of the illicit trafficker. </p>

<p>In the preceding pages we have utilized such figures as we
have found available in an effort to show the extent of this
problem. These figures have been in sonic cases incomplete, and
in others, for one reason or another, subject to doubt or
controversy. Unfortunately a sufficient number of local surveys
at any given period has not been made to furnish material for a
reliable cross-section of the country. Conditions existing in one
section may be attacked with at least a show of justice when
applied to others. Population composition, occupation, and even
climate, to say nothing of many other sociologic influences, tend
to vitiate generalizations made from local data of this kind. </p>

<p>For comparison we are giving in the following table the
findings of the surveys suitable for purposes of generalization
together with certain computations based thereon. The other
surveys of which we have record are too incomplete or for one
reason or another too inconclusive to warrant their use as bases
for general estimates. </p>

<p>A more recent estimate 24<b> </b>of the number of addicts in
the United States is that of Lawrence Kolb and A. G. Du Mez of
the United States Public Health Service. While not based on an
original survey of a community or section of the country, the
estimate of these authors is of interest as a result of their
analysis of certain recent surveys and other data. In their
introduction they state: </p>

<p>'Kolb, Lawrence, and A. G. Du Mez---'The Prevalence and Trend
of Drug Addiction in the United States and Factors Influencing
It.&quot; Public Health Reports--May 28, 1924. </p>

<p>&quot;It is realized that it is impossible at the present time
to make an exact count of the persons addicted to narcotics in
the United States in an individual State, or even in one of our
larger cities, because of the social and legal factors tending to
make addiction a secret practice. It is believed, however, that
it is possible, by utilizing all of the information now
available, to delimit the number by certain maximum and minimum
figures. With this object in view, a number of the more important
narcotic surveys made in recent years were analyzed; also the
reports made by agents of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and
other persons on the narcotic clinics conducted in different
parts of the country; statistics on the dose of addiction, world
production of narcotics, and the quantities imported into this
country were compiled and studied; and numerous physicians in
different parts of the country were interviewed in person to
ascertain the number of addicts they were treating in the course
of their practice. The results of these analyses and studies
follow:&quot; </p>

<p>After their analysis of the surveys and clinic reports, they
conclude as follows: </p>

<p>&quot;In summing up it may be stated that according to Brown's
survey, 215,000 was approximately the number of addicts in the
United States in 1915. The New York City, the Treasury
Department, and the clinic surveys were made four or five years
later. An objection to making a general application of the New
York City survey is that the sex and age distribution of addicts
shown by it does not obtain throughout the country. This was
probably due in part to the fact already referred to, namely,
that young addicts are attracted to large cities, and conditions
exist in them which cause a delinquent type of addiction; and it
is also due in part to the fact that some of the older addicts
were being taken care of by physicians and were not counted when
the survey was made. Just how far these two factors balance each
other is not known, but the 140,600 indicated by the New York
City survey in 1920 shows a reduction over the 1915 figures. The
clinic surveys made at the same time or a year later took in
nearly all sections of the country and comprised a more
representative group of population. These surveys show 104,300
addicts.' The Pennsylvania figures, collected over a period of
five years and ending about a year after the clinics were closed,
show approximately 109,250 addicts in the United States in 1922
when the actual count of 9,000 is used. The Army rate is
undoubtedly too low for the particular group surveyed, and for
reasons already given for estimating addiction in the population
as a whole. The 1918 Treasury Department survey shows 237,655
addicts and apparently contains an indeterminate error of
exaggeration, as already pointed out. The highest estimate based
on any unrevised survey is 269,000; the lowest, exclusive of the
Army survey, is 104,300. These figures may therefore be accepted
as the maximum and minimum numbers for the period 1915 to 1922;
but from what has been brought out relative to the surveys it
would seem that somewhat less than 215,000 is more nearly correct
for the beginning and about 110,000 the approximate number for
the end of the period.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="op100006.gif" align="bottom" width="452"

<p>The second part of their report is a consideration of the
estimated number of addicts &quot;based on dosage and available
supplies.&quot; Using as a basis for their computations an
average daily dose of six grains of morphin sulphate, which they
state they obtained as a result of their studies, the authors
show in tabular form in ten-year periods in the next table the
number of addicts who would be supplied if all of the opium
entered for consumption were used for addicts. </p>

<p>They state: </p>

<p>&quot;These figures are given for a period prior to the time
when restrictions were placed on the traffic in opium, and there
was no incentive to the smuggling trade as there is to-day. It is
therefore believed that at no time have there been more than
246,000 opium addicts in the United States.&quot; </p>

<p>' A press release from the Narcotic Division of the
Prohibition Unit, Bureau of Internal Revenue, dated May 4, 1924,
states: &quot;It is estimated that there are upwards of 500,000
drug addicts in the United States . . . . .. </p>

<p>Following the same reasoning in regard to the total world
production of opium these authors conclude that at this rate
&quot;the total annual production of opium, exclusive of that
produced in the countries of the Far East, if used entirely for
the satisfaction of addiction, would supply only about 566,000
addicts.&quot; </p>

<p>It is necessary to emphasize, as the authors themselves have
pointed out, how impossible it is to obtain accurate statistics
on the world opium production. The data upon which the above
estimate of 566,000 was based were obtained from statistics
compiled by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium of the
League of Nations who the authors state, &quot;admits that the
figures given are only estimates in the majority of cases.&quot;
Further it should- be remembered that the annual production
figures vary from year to year and an estimate based on the
figures for one year-the above estimate of 566,000 is based on
the production figures of 1922-is true for that year alone,
granting that the figures are correct, and may be quite different
from those based on figures of other years. </p>

<p><img src="op100007.gif" align="bottom" width="456"
height="347"> </p>

<p>They continue: </p>

<p>&quot;It has been shown that at no time have the annual
importations of narcotic drugs into this country been greater
than would be necessary to supply 264,000 addicts, assuming that
they were used in their entirety for the satisfaction of
addiction. No one contends that they were so used, but it has
been asserted that at least 75 per cent of the quantities
imported are used for this purpose. It is believed that a fairly
accurate estimate of the amounts used for the satisfaction of
addiction subsequent to 1909, when the entry of smoking opium was
prohibited, can be obtained by using the import statistics given
in Tables 2 and 3. </p>

<p>&quot;For the four-year period, 1920-1923, the importations of
opium amounted to 144,805 pounds annually. For this same period
5,282 ounces of opium alkaloids were imported annually. The
narcotic division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue estimates
that not over 15 per cent of these quantities get into
illegitimate channels. Making these deductions it may be assumed
that 123,084 pounds of opium and 4,490 ounces of opium alkaloids
are required annually to supply the legitimate medicinal needs of
the country, including the needs of many old and incurable
addicts now being supplied by physicians, which number is
constantly decreasing. By subtracting these amounts from the
amounts imported annually for the decade 1910 to 1919 we obtain
242,971 pounds of opium and 22,653 ounces of opium alkaloids. </p>

<p>&quot;These quantities would supply approximately 100,000
addicts for a year. Making similar computations for coca leaves
and coca leaf alkaloids, it is found that approximately 9,000
addicts could be supplied with the quantities which were formerly
imported in excess of what has been imported in recent years.
This would make a total of 109,000 addicts who, prior to 1915,
could have obtained their supplies of narcotics from the
quantities imported legally. In view of the limited supplies of
medicinal opium available in the world and the rigid control of
narcotics exercised by this country, it is highly improbable that
the combined quantities available to addicts in 1919 and 1920
from smuggled sources and from leakage through legitimate
channels were more than sufficient to supply the number
(109,000). This is probably too high, in view of the reduction
which has been shown, but if we add to this figure the number of
aged and incurable addicts who received their supplies through
legitimate channels, the total number of addicts in this country
for the period stated was probably somewhere between 120,000 and
140,000, which is in keeping with the figures arrived at from the
surveys and clinic reports. </p>

<p>&quot;That the quantities of narcotics smuggled into this
country are in all likelihood not as great as is believed by
some, is shown by the quantities reported as falling into the
possession of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in the enforcement
of the narcotic laws. For the year ending June 30, 1922, the
total quantity, including opium and coca leaves, preparations
containing opium and coca leaves, the alkaloids of opium and
cocaine, and preparations containing these alkaloids, was only
4,447 pounds. In 1923 it was 542 pounds.&quot; </p>

<p>In connection with the above statements, we should like to
point out that in our opinion a decrease in the amount of drug
confiscated does not necessarily indicate a decrease in
smuggling. The report of the Special Committee of the Treasury
Department, 1918, states that </p>

<p>&quot;in recent years, especially since the enactment of the
Harrison law, the traffic by 'underground' channels has increased
enormously, and at the present time it is believed to be equally
as extensive as that carried on in a legitimate manner!&quot; How
much of this traffic found its source of supply in smuggling and
to what extent the activities of the federal bureau charged with
the enforcement of the law have diminished smuggling operations
since 1918, we are unable to say. However, we believe that the
significance of the above statement should be considered. </p>

<p>Earlier in this chapter we have. pointed out the
undesirability of attempting to make an estimate of the number of
addicts based on the amount of the drug available for consumption
and the average daily dose. We again wish to point out the
present lack of data, at least in our experience, which would
warrant the acceptance of any figure as a representative average
daily dose for addicts. </p>

<p>From their interviews with physicians the authors conclude as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;Confirmation of the estimates based on the supplies of
narcotics available and on the findings of the various surveys as
to the number of addicts and the trend of narcotic addiction in
the United States is furnished by the experience of physicians as
related to us. We have interviewed physicians from all parts of
the United States and it is unusual to find one who has an addict
among his patients. Few besides those who have contact with penal
institutions and sanitariums meet any great number. Many
physicians still occasionally see a transient addict who drops in
and begs for a dose, but this, too, is growing rare. Some of the
physicians who have been practicing for years in small towns and
rural communities speak of addicts they have cured by the aid of
the Harrison law or who have, without outside assistance, cured
themselves. Some of them are taking care of one or more old or
incurable cases but from the information they give it seems that
new cases of addiction are not arising to take the place of the
old ones who die. </p>

<p>&quot;The accuracy of our observation is Supported by the
findings of Dr. Carleton Simon, special deputy police
commissioner in charge of the narcotic division of the police
department of New York City, who sent out a questionnaire to the
physicians in New York State. Of the 7,599 physicians who
replied, only 52 per cent reported that they were treating
addicts in 1922.&quot; </p>

<p>Two questions arise as to the justification of the above
deductions based on interviews with physicians throughout the
country; first, were a sufficient and representative number of
physicians interviewed to portray a fair picture of existing
conditions; and second, is it reasonable to expect that the
majority of addicts under present conditions place themselves in
the hands of physicians? In regard to the latter question we
believe that for reasons pointed out in the following chapter the
tendency of the physician is to avoid contact with the problem of
addiction. </p>

<p>As a final conclusion in regard to the present number of
addicts, the authors state: </p>

<p>&quot;The evidence seems to show that a maximum estimate for
the number of addicts in the United States at the present time
would be 150,000. The estimates based on actual counts and on the
available supplies of narcotics, together with conditions
reported by the physicians interviewed, point to about 110,000,
which number is believed to be nearly correct.&quot; </p>

<p>In general, a review of the material already covered in this
chapter will show it in the above study in the first place
certain surveys have not been taken into consideration and in the
second place, incorrect deductions have been drawn from two of
the official reports cited. Among the first may be named the
Jacksonville, Fla., survey made in 1913, about a year before the
Tennessee study. A consideration of the earlier surveys may have
been omitted because of the supposed existence of different
influencing factors by reason of time. In regard to this point we
believe that however different conditions may be at the present
time, the changes have not been great enough to eliminate
completely the significance of these early figures. </p>

<p>In regard to the second point, namely the incorrect
deductions, it is true that there actually were reported only
73,150 addicts in the survey made by the special committee of the
Treasury Department, 1918, which on the basis of 100 per cent
replies would yield 237,655 addicts under treatment in the entire
country. The report from which they take this figure has already
been considered above. The figure which they quote is not given
in the original report as the committee's estimate of the total
number of addicts in the country, but only as the estimated
number of addicts under treatment by physicians during the period
when the survey was made, as the report states, I............
only a small portion of the total number of addicts presented
themselves for treatment. Addicts of the 'underworld', for
instance, secure most of their supply through illicit channels
and rarely, if ever, consult a physician.&quot; Further, had Kolb
and Du Mez employed the figures resulting from queries sent to
health officials they would have reached a total for the country
of 420,000 addicts, which figure, the committee's report states,
&quot;appears to be much too low in view of the fact that the
physicians of the country are estimated to have bad about 237,000
addicts under treatment during the same period.&quot; Further on
the report of the Treasury Department, after considering the
errors potentially residing in all of the -figures presented,
both from general and local sources, reaches the following
conclusion: &quot;Taking these facts into consideration, the
committee is of the opinion that the total number of addicts in
this country probably exceeds 1,000,000 at the present time,'-a
statement which Kolb and Du Mez did not take into account. Again,
these authors quoted only the lower figures and lost sight of the
final estimate of the number of addicts in the state of New York
made by Commissioner Herrick in his report of the work of the
Narcotic Control Commission when he states: </p>

<p>&quot;I think a safe and conservative approximation would be
39,000. The records of the Department show in round numbers
13,000 registered addicts. This number is composed of those who
obtain habit-forming drugs through legitimate sources, that is,
directly from a doctor or on prescriptions issued by a doctor,
filled by a druggist, or from the different clinics established
throughout the State. To these figures should be added twice the
number, which is an approximation of the users who, obtain drugs
from peddlers, or other illicit sources. Of course, this latter
figure, as I have stated, is only an approximation. I base it on
the percentage of addicts among the great number with whom I have
personally conferred, who have admitted that they obtained their
drugs from peddlers or other illicit sources.&quot; </p>

<p>The importance of these estimates in relation to their use as
a basis for further estimates or comparisons is obvious. </p>

<p>Finally in view of the various considerations pointed out in
regard to the above study, we cannot agree that the ultimate
estimate of 110,000 is warranted. While we on the one hand
deplore unjustifiable, sensational exaggerations, on the other,
we recognize the danger of basing maximal estimates on selected
data. </p>

<p>One other method of arriving at a satisfying conclusion as to
the extent of this problem exists. It is quite remote from what
we may terra the mathematical procedure, and, while neither
specific in its application nor concerned with actual numbers,
includes presumptive evidence of such importance and brings into
consideration such deeprooted human attributes and such
well-known characteristics as to render it, perhaps, the most
important method of all, while, parodoxical as it may seem, the
least definite. We refer to a review of the growth </p>

<p>in the use of opium through the many and varied motives as
presented and revealed by available historic record. That there
has been a continuous, marked increase in the consumption of
opium and its products in the United States, at least through
1915, is shown in the following table of importations. The supply
has but filled the demand. Tile conclusion is inevitable that the
number of chronic users, for one reason or another, steadily has
been increasing, as upon the basis of the therapeutic use of
these drugs alone-in the treatment of disease other than that of
chronic opium intoxication-such an increase would have been
impossible. In 1915 two things occurred simultaneously, the
importations decreased and the illicit traffic began to develop.
This doubtless was due chiefly to the fact that chronic users,
because of the restrictions placed upon physicians and
pharmacists in the handling of these drugs, sought their supplies
from underworld sources. It does not mean necessarily that the
consumption of opium has decreased. </p>

<p>Inasmuch as this comprises a study of the development of the
problem of chronic opium intoxication we shall take it up in a
separate chapter, tracing its progress through the early
unrestricted use and popularity of opium to relieve pain in that
period of medical enlightenment when attention was directed at
symptoms rather than cause, the ignorance of the dangers of
continued use, the discovery of its value for therapeutic uses,
the influence of such writings as De Quincey's and others of his
day, the introduction and widespread use of the hypodermic
syringe, the influence of the Civil War and other wars, the
practice of opium smoking, the influence of the patent medicine
industry, the discovery and use of heroin, the illicit traffic
which has grown up since the enactment of anti-narcotic laws and
the general lack of interest and laxness in medical teachings and
practice in the employment of opium preparations. </p>

<p>RESUME </p>

<p>The period covered in the foregoing material dates from the
earliest time in which this problem in the United States appears
to have received individual or public recognition up to the
present time. From beginning to end the material is fragmentary.
Altogether very few surveys have been made and those that do
exist are more or less imperfect due to one or another vitiating
factor. Incompleteness seems to be an outstanding feature of
practically all surveys. This may be explained by the nature of
the problem and the prevailing early and present attitudes toward
the individuals affected, as a result of which they are not
inclined to reveal their condition. Other influences tending to
render the surveys already made inapplicable to generalization
are community variations such as race composition, method of
conducting survey, method of registration, classes represented in
survey, attitude and experience of investigators, etc. Moreover,
singularly enough, in spite of a growing interest evinced in the
problem as a result of the enactment of the Harrison Narcotic
Act, the results of several of the earlier investigations appear
better adapted to generalization than most of those made public
since the enforcement of this law. In consideration of the above
factors it must be concluded that we do not know the total number
of opiate users in the United States today. </p>

<p><img src="op100009.gif" align="bottom" width="451"

<p>Whatever their inaccuracies, these surveys and estimates
indicate sufficiently clearly the existence of a major
medico-social problem to make the denial of the existence of a
general situation far more dangerous than its affirmation. As a
matter of fact, it is not necessary to know the exact number of
users or even the minimal extent, to realize that there are a
large number in the country and that the problem is serious.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Report </b></p>

<h1>FOREWORD </h1>

<p><b>by Fiorello LaGuardia</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>As Mayor of the City of New York, it is my duty to foresee and
take steps to prevent the development of hazards to the health,
safety, and welfare of our citizens. When rumors were recently
circulated concerning the smoking of marihuana by large segments
of our population and even by school children, I sought advice
from The New York Academy of Medicine, as is my custom when
confronted with problems of medical import. On the Academy's
recommendation I appointed a special committee to make a thorough
sociological and scientific investigation, and secured funds from
three Foundations with which to finance these studies. </p>

<p>My own interest in marihuana goes back many years, to the time
when I was a member of the House of Representatives and, in that
capacity, heard of the use of marihuana by soldiers stationed in
Panama. I was impressed at that time with the report of an Army
Board of Inquiry which emphasized the relative harmlessness of
the drug and the fact that it played a very little role, if any,
in problems of delinquency and crime in the Canal Zone. </p>

<p>The report of the present investigations covers every phase of
the problem and is of practical value not only to our own city
but to communities throughout the country. It is a basic
contribution to medicine and pharmacology. I am glad that the
sociological, psychological, and medical ills commonly attributed
to marihuana have been found to be exaggerated insofar as the
City of New York is concerned. I hasten to point out, however,
that the findings are to be interpreted only as a reassuring
report of progress and not as encouragement to indulgence, for I
shall continue to enforce the laws prohibiting the use of
marihuana until and if complete findings may justify an amendment
to existing laws. The scientific part of the research will be
continued in the hope that the drug may prove to possess
therapeutic value for the control of drug addiction. </p>

<p>I take this occasion to express my appreciation and gratitude
to the members of my committee, to The New York Academy of
Medicine, and to the Commonwealth Fund, the Friedsam Foundation,
and the New York Foundation which supported these important
investigations so generously.<br>
</p>

<p>F. H. LaGuardia </p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>

<p><b>E. H. L. Corwin, PhD, Secretary</b></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 13, 1938, The New York Academy of Medicine was
informed of Mayor LaGuardia's concern about the marihuana problem
and of his desire &quot;that some impartial body such as The New
York Academy of Medicine make a survey of existing knowledge on
this subject and carry out any observations required to determine
the pertinent facts regarding this form of drug addiction and the
necessity for its control.&quot; The Mayor's request was referred
to the Committee on Public Health Relations of the Academy, which
Committee on October 17, 1938, authorized the appointment of a
special subcommittee to study the Mayor's request. </p>

<p>This Subcommittee, consisting of Dr. George B. Wallace,
Chairman, Dr. E. H. L. Corwin, Secretary, and Drs. McKeen
Cattell, Leon H. Cornwall, Robert F. Loeb, Currier McEwen, B. S.
Oppenheimer, Charles Diller Ryan, and Dudley D. Shoenfeld,
reviewed the existing literature on the subject. On the basis of
this review, the Subcommittee could come to no conclusion
regarding the effect of marihuana upon the psychological and
physiological functions of the human being. Nor were attempts to
learn the extent of the use of marihuana in New York City any
more successful. A conference with representatives of the Police
Department, the Department of Education, the Department of
Correction, the Psychiatric Division of the Department of
Hospitals, the Court of Domestic Relations, the District
Attorney's office, and the Citizens Committee on the Control of
Crime served to emphasize the existing differences of opinion
regarding the extent of the use of marihuana in this city and its
relationship to crime. </p>

<p>The Subcommittee therefore came to the conclusion that, in
view of the possibility that marihuana smoking might constitute
an important social problem, it was time that a study of its
effects be made based upon well-established evidence, and
prepared an outline of methods of procedure for the study of the
problem. It recommended that such a study should be divided into
two parts: ( 1 ) a sociological study dealing with the extent of
marihuana smoking and the methods by which the drug is obtained;
in what districts and among what races, classes or types of
persons the use is most prevalent; whether certain social
conditions are factors in its use, and what relation there is
between its use and criminal or antisocial acts; and (2) a
clinical study to determine by means of controlled experiments
the physiological and psychological effects of marihuana on
different types of persons; the question as to whether it causes
physical or mental deterioration; and its possible therapeutic
effects in the treatment of disease or of other drug addictions. </p>

<p>The Committee on Public Health Relations adopted the report of
its Subcommittee and recommended to Mayor LaGuardia that he
appoint a special committee to carry out the proposed study.
Accordingly in January 1939 he appointed the Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana, composed of the members of the Subcommittee of the
Committee on Public Health Relations which recommended the study
and four ex-officio members: Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, First Deputy
Commissioner (later Commissioner) of Correction; Dr. Karl M.
Bowman, Director of the Psychiatric Division of the Department of
Hospitals; Dr. S. S. Goldwater, Commissioner of Hospitals- and
Dr. John L. Rich, Commissioner of Health. Upon his accession to
the commissionership of the Department of Hospitals, Dr. Willard
C. Rappleye succeeded Dr. Goldwater as a member of this
Committee. This Committee studied the broad outlines of the
proposed plans for about a year before work was actually begun. </p>

<p>At its first meeting in March 1939 two subcommittees were
appointed; one, consisting of Drs. Shoenfeld, Ryan, and Corwin,
to plan the sociological study, and the other, composed of Drs.
Cattell, Bowman, Cornwall, and Loeb, to work out the details of
the clinical study. Drs. Bowman and Wechsler were appointed as
special advisers for the clinical study and Dr. J. Murray Steele
and Dr. S. Bernard Wortis as the supervisors of this study. </p>

<p>The studies were made possible by the financial support of
three Foundations, the Friedsam Foundation, the New York
Foundation, and the Commonwealth Fund, each of which donated
$7,500. The whole amounts granted by the Friedsam Foundation and
the Commonwealth Fund and $5,000 of the New York Foundation's
grant were to be applied to the clinical study- the remaining
$2,500 given by the New York Foundation was earmarked for the
sociological study. The Research Council of the Department of
Hospitals undertook the financial supervision of the clinical
study and The New York Academy of Medicine that of the
sociological study. </p>

<p>The sociological study proceeded under the active direction of
Dr. Dudley D. Shoenfeld and was carried out by six police
officers who were trained by Dr. Shoenfeld as social
investigators. In acknowledgment of the great help rendered to
the Committee by these officers, the Committee passed the
following resolution at its meeting on March 18, 1941.<br>
</p>

<p>Now that the sociological study of the marihuana problem in
New York City has been completed, the Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana wishes to record its appreciation of the Mayor's
interest in this problem and his placing at the disposal of the
Committee the services of the Narcotic Squad Division of the
Police Department. Without the cooperation of Commissioner
Valentine, Inspector Curtayne, Lieutenant Cooper, Sergeant
Boylan, and Detective Loures, this study would have been
impossible. They helped in planning it and assigned to the
Committee six members of the Force, four men and two women, whose
intelligence, interest in the work, and desire to obtain the
facts of the situation were of invaluable aid in obtaining the
information on which the sociological report is based. The four
men and two women assigned to us made painstaking observations
and reports, acted as investigators and social workers and not as
police officers, and brought to the performance of this task a
native intelligence, specialized training, and civic interest.
The thanks of the Committee are due to them and through them to
their superiors.<br>
</p>

<p>The clinical study consisted of two parts; the medical,
including psychiatric, and the psychological. Dr. Karl M. Bowman
directed the medical and psychiatric part of this study and Dr.
David Wechsler the psychological part. The members of the
Committee closely supervised the work during the course of the
study. The staff of the clinical study included: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Samuel Allentuck, MD, Psychiatrist, who was in charge. </li>
    <li>Louis Gitzelter, MD </li>
    <li>Frank Anker, MD Assistant Physicians </li>
    <li>Robert S. Morrow, PhD </li>
    <li>Florence Halpern, MA </li>
    <li>Adolph G. Woltmann,MA Psychologists </li>
    <li>Miss Rose Horowitz, who was the secretary-stenographer
        and bookkeeper.<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Committee is indebted to the Department of Hospitals for
making available two small wards and office space in the Welfare
Hospital (now known as the Goldwater Memorial Hospital), to Dr.
Chrisman G. Scheri, the Superintendent of the hospital, and to
the laboratory staff of the Third Medical Division for their
assistance in the conduct of laboratory experiments.
Acknowledgment should also be made of the services of Dr. Robert
C. Batterman who interpreted the electrocardiograms and Dr. Hans
Strauss for the electroencephalographic work. Professor Walter R.
Miles of Yale University assisted in the planning of the
psychological part of the study. This whole undertaking would
have been impossible without the help and cooperation of Dr.
Peter F. Amoroso, of the Department of Correction, who, aside
from his services as a member of the Committee, was responsible
for arrangements for volunteers from among the prisoners of the
Riker's Island Penitentiary. Thanks are due also to the medical
staff of the Riker's Island Hospital for their assistance in the
narcotic addiction study. </p>

<p>At the suggestion of Dr. Cattell a pharmacological study was
done in the Department of Pharmacology of Cornell Medical School
by Dr. S. Loewe. Dr. W. Modell collaborated in this work. We are
indebted to Dr. Roger Adams, Professor of Chemistry at the
University of Illinois, and to Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting
Chemist of the United States Treasury Department, who supplied
some of the active principles of marihuana which were used in the
study. </p>

<p>The names of those who conducted the investigations are given
under the different chapters. Those sections of the report for
which no author is indicated have been written by the Chairman of
the Committee. </p>

<p>The tremendous task of compiling, editing, and revising the
reports was undertaken by Dr. George B. Wallace, the chairman of
the Committee, and Miss Elizabeth V. Cunningham of the staff of
the Committee on Public Health Relations of The New York Academy
of Medicine. They had the assistance of Dr. Dudley D. Shoenfeld,
who prepared the sociological report, Dr. David Wechsler, who
revised the psychological reports, and Dr. McKeen Cattell, who
edited the pharmacological report. </p>

<p>In the judgment of the Committee, this painstaking study
should be of considerable value from a scientific and social
viewpoint. </p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report,</b> </p>

<p><b>THE SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY</b> </p>

<p><b>Dudley D. Shoenfeld, MD<br>
</b></p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<hr>

<p>In order to understand fully the purpose and scope of this
particular part of the survey conducted by the Mayor's Committee
on Marihuana, a brief digest of the history of the growth and
usage of this drug is essential. </p>

<p>Indian hemp, from which marihuana (the American synonym for
hashish) is obtained, has been known to man for more than three
thousand years. This plant, although originally indigenous to
Central Asia, is now found in practically every section of the
world, growing either wild or cultivated, legally or illegally. </p>

<p>When originally discovered, the use to which this plant was
principally put was the conversion of its fiber for commerical
purposes in the production of cord, twine and textiles. Shortly
thereafter its pharmaceutical properties were employed in the
practice of medicine and surgery. Authoritative proof is
available that the Chinese found it valuable as an effective
anesthetic in surgery as far back as two thousand years. It was
not until approximately the tenth century that the peoples of
Africa and Asia began to use it in a rather indiscriminate manner
for its intoxicating effects. </p>

<p>Very shortly after its usage became popular, this drug engaged
the attention of the various African and Asian governments, as
well as of lay persons interested in medical, religious and
sociological problems. Some of these very early investigators
propounded the theory that physical and mental deterioration was
the direct result of smoking hashish. Others extolled its
benefits, deeming it actually essential to life, and urged people
to indulge in it. </p>

<p>During this early period, the peoples of Europe were aware of
the use of hashish in Africa and Asia, and considered it a vice
particularly common to the peoples of those continents. In the
nineteenth century their interest was raised to a high pitch
because of the fictional reports of the smoking of hashish given
by the romanticists of that period. These individuals, who had
the power of the pen, experimentally indulged in the smoking of
hashish, and described in an expansive, subjective manner the
effects the drug had upon them. A review of the fanciful
literature reveals that in most instances these writings referred
to the authors' experiences with toxic doses. Summed up, the
conclusions were that hashish could cause psychotic episodes and
even death and that prolonged use would result in physical and
mental deterioration. The exalted position held by these
romanticists tended to influence the Europeans to accept their
conclusions as scientific monographs on the subject of hashish,
so that the smoking of hashish did not become popular with them.
However, in recent years there has been a fairly wide
participation on the part of Europeans in smoking hashish or
marihuana, but it is referred to as an American vice. This allows
one to infer that whereas the knowledge pertaining to this habit
was very early recognized in Europe, at the present time
participation in it is from their point of view the direct result
of its introduction into Europe not from Africa and Asia, but
from America. </p>

<p>In America, Indian hemp was planted in the New England
colonies, solely for commercial purposes, as early as the
seventeenth century. At the present time it can be found growing
either wild or cultivated, legally or illegally, in practically
all our states. Lawful cultivation is confined principally to the
states of Kentucky, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. It has
been estimated that not more than ten thousand acres are devoted
to its legal production. It is of value commercially in the
manufacture of rope, twine, and textiles. The seed is used for
bird- food, and the oil extracted from the seed is occasionally
used as a substitute for linseed oil in the preparation of
artists' paints. A rosin extracted from the plant is used in the
production of pharmaceutical preparations. </p>

<p>Since the history of hemp cultivation in America dates back to
the seventeenth century, it is exceedingly interesting, but
difficult to explain, that the smoking of marihuana did not
become a problem in our country until approximately twenty years
ago, and that it has become an acute problem associated with a
great deal of publicity only in the past ten years. </p>

<p>The origin of the word &quot;marihuana&quot; is in doubt. Some
authorities are of the opinion that it is derived from the
Portuguese word &quot;mariguano,&quot; meaning intoxicant. Others
are of the opinion that it has its derivation in the Mexican
words for &quot;Mary and Jane.&quot; The introduction into the
United States of the practice of smoking marihuana has been the
subject of a great deal of speculation. The most tenable
hypothesis at the present time is that it was introduced by
Mexicans entering our country. </p>

<p>It is accepted that in Mexico marihuana smoking is an old,
established practice. Therefore, it would appear logical to
assume that Mexican laborers crossing our border into the
Southwest carried this practice with them. Having used marihuana
in their native land, they found it natural to continue smoking
it in the new country, and planted it for personal consumption.
Once available, it was soon made use of by our citizens. At the
present time, the smoking of marihuana is widespread in this
nation. </p>

<p>Believing that marihuana smoking might be deleterious, and
knowing it to be widespread, federal and municipal governments,
private individuals, and such agencies as the Opium Advisory
Association, the International Narcotic Education Association,
and others investigated the subject. These investigative
organizations have contributed a great deal of data and pertinent
information to the knowledge of the use of marihuana. The mass of
information so obtained when untangled can be summed up with the
general statement that a majority of investigators are of the
opinion that marihuana smoking is deleterious, although a
minority maintain that it is innocuous. The majority believe that
marihuana smoking is widespread among school children; that the
dispensers of the drug are organized to such an extent that they
encourage the use of marihuana in order to create an ever-
increasing market; that juvenile delinquency is directly related
to the effects of the drug; that it is a causative factor in a
large percentage of our major crimes and sexual offenses; and
that physical and mental deterioration are the direct result of
the prolonged habit of smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>As a result of these official and semi-official conclusions in
regard to the disastrous effects produced by this habit, the
newspapers and magazines of our country have given it wide
publicity. At this point it may be profitable to give the
conclusions of some of the investigators and quote the publicity
associated with it. In a pamphlet &quot;Marihuana or Indian Hemp
and Its Preparations&quot; issued by the International Narcotic
Education Association, one finds: </p>

<p><b>(quotation)</b> </p>

<p>Marihuana is a most virile and powerful stimulant. The
physiological effect of this drug produces a peculiar psychic
exaltation and derangement of the central nervous system. The
stage of exaltation and confusion, more marked in some addicts
than in others, is generally followed by a stage of depression.
Sometimes the subject passes into a semi- conscious state,
experiencing vivid and extravagant dreams which vary according to
the individual character and mentality. In some the stage is one
of self-satisfaction and well-being. In others, it is alarming,
presenting the fear of some imminent and indefinite danger or of
impending death. Later the dreams are sometimes followed by a
state of complete unconsciousness. Sometimes convulsive attacks
and acute mania are developed. </p>

<p>The narcotic content in marihuana decreases the rate of heart
beat and causes irregularity of the pulse. Death may result from
the effect upon the heart. Prolonged use of marihuana frequently
develops a delirious rage which sometimes leads to high crimes,
such as assault and murder. Hence marihuana has been called the
&quot;killer drug.&quot; The habitual use of this narcotic poison
always causes a very marked mental deterioration and sometimes
produces insanity. Hence marihuana is frequently called
&quot;loco weed.&quot; (Loco is the Spanish word for crazy.) </p>

<p>While the marihuana habit leads to physical wreckage and
mental decay, its effects upon character and morality are even
more devastating. The victim frequently undergoes such degeneracy
that he will lie and steal without scruple; he becomes utterly
untrustworthy and often drifts into the underworld where, with
his degenerate companions, he commits high crimes and
misdemeanors. Marihuana sometimes gives man the lust to kill
unreasonably and without motive. Many cases of assault, rape,
robbery, and murder are traced to the use of maribuana.(1) </p>

</p>

<p>In an article published in the New York Daily Worker, New
York, Saturday, December 28, 1940, there appeared under the
column headed &quot;HEALTH ADVICE&quot;:<br>
</p>

<p><b>(start quoted article)</b> </p>

<p><b>A DRUG AND INSANITY.</b> </p>

<p>Bill Wilson was strolling by his favorite soda joint on the
way home from high school when he heard a familiar voice whisper
loudly, &quot;Hey, Bill, c'mere.&quot; Behind the Texaco
billboard, he found his side-kick Jim, who said excitedly,
&quot;I got some reefers!&quot; &quot;Reefers, what're
they?&quot; </p>

<p>Mysteriously, Jim reached into his pocket and pulled out two
large cigarettes. &quot;Marihuana!&quot; Jim's pupils dilated.
&quot;Come on over to the club and we'll smoke 'em. Boy, that's
fun!&quot; Bill is only one of thousands of new marihuana smokers
created yearly among boys and girls of high school age. </p>

<p>What is this drug? It is a narcotic in the same class as opium
and is derived from a plant, which grows wild, extensively in
some parts. For this reason, it is hard to control and the drug
is easy to obtain at very little cost. Smoking of the weed is
habit-forming. It destroys the willpower, releases restraints,
and promotes insane reactions. Continued use causes the face to
become bloated, the eyes bloodshot, the limbs weak and trembling,
and the mind sinks into insanity. Robberies, thrill murders, sex
crimes and other offenses result. </p>

<p>When the habit is first started, the symptoms are milder, yet
powerful enough. The smoker loses all sense of time and space so
that he can't judge distances, he loses his self-control, and his
imagination receives considerable stimulation. </p>

<p>The habit can be cured only by the most severe methods. The
addict must be put into an institution, where the drug is
gradually withdrawn, his general health is built up, and he is
kept there until he has enough willpower to withstand the
temptation to again take to the weed. </p>

<p>The spread of this terrible fad can be stopped only when the
unscrupulous criminals trafficking In the drug are rooted out. </p>

<p><b>(end quoted article)<br>
</b></p>

<p>Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of Pharmacology of the School
of Medicine of the University of Mississippi, has written a most
comprehensive book on the subject of marihuana, embodying in
detail pharmacological and social studies.(2) A chapter on the
&quot;Present Status of the Marihuana Vice in the United
States&quot; was prepared by Dr. Frank R. Gomila, Commissioner of
Public Safety of New Orleans, and C. G. Lambou, Assistant City
Chemist. They refer to New Orleans as being possibly the first
large city in the United States where the drug habit became
widely established among the native population, and they
therefore believe that the authorities in this city had a decided
opportunity to observe the progress of the smoking of marihuana
as a social problem. Referring specifically to the use of
marihuana among school children, they state that reporters in New
Orleans not only heard about but observed large numbers of boys
of school age actually buying and smoking marihuana cigarettes.
One peddler was so brazen as to keep his stock under the street
stairs to a girls' high school. </p>

<p>Inquiries further revealed that school children of forty-four
schools in New Orleans (only a few of these were high schools)
smoked marihuana. As a result of exposure and widespread
agitation, </p>

<p><b>(start quotation)</b> </p>

<p>Verifications came in by the hundreds from harassed parents,
teachers, neighborhood pastors, priests, welfare workers and club
women. Warrington House for boys was full of children who had
become habituated to the use of cannabis. The superintendent of
the Children's Bureau reported that there were many problem
children there who had come under the influence and two who had
run away because they couldn't get their &quot;muggles&quot; at
the Bureau. The Director of Kingsley House for boys received many
pleas from fathers of boys who had come under the influence and
were charged with petty crimes. </p>

<p>After personally seeing these boys in an hysterical condition
or on the well-known &quot;laughing jags,&quot; the director
termed the situation decidedly grave. The Waif's Home, at this
time, was reputedly full of children, both white and colored, who
had been brought in under the influence of the drug. Marihuana
cigarettes could be bought almost as readily as sandwiches. Their
cost was two for a quarter. The children solved the problem of
cost by pooling pennies among the members of a group and then
passing the cigarettes from one to another, all the puffs being
carefully counted.... </p>

<p>The result of these investigations ended in a wholesale arrest
of more than 150 persons. Approximately one hundred underworld
dives, soft-drink establishments, night clubs, grocery stores,
and private homes were searched in the police raid. Addicts,
hardened criminals, gangsters, women of the streets sailors of
all nationalities, bootleggers, boys and girls, -- many flashily
dressed in silks and furs, others in working clothes -- all were
rounded up in the net which Captain Smith and his squad had set. </p>

<p>. . . Notwithstanding the thoroughness with which this police
roundup was carried out, it did not entirely eradicate in one
stroke a vice which had already become so well established.
During the next few years New Orleans experienced a crime wave
which unquestionably was greatly aggravated by the influence of
this drug habit. Payroll and bank guards were doubled, but this
did not prevent some of the most spectacular holdups in the
history of the city. Youngsters known to be
&quot;muggle-heads&quot; fortified themselves with the narcotic
and proceeded to shoot down police, bank clerks and casual
bystanders. Mr. Eugene Stanley, at that time District Attorney,
declared that many of the crimes in New Orleans and the South
were thus committed by criminals who relied on the drug to give
them a false courage and freedom from restraint. Dr. George
Roeling, Coroner, reported that of 450 prisoners investigated,
125 were confirmed users of marihuana. Dr. W. B. Graham, State
Narcotic Officer, declared in 1936 that 60 per cent of the crimes
committed in New Orleans were by marihuana users.(3) </p>

<p><b>(end quote)<br>
</b></p>

<p>The Mayor's Committee on Marihuana decided to confine its
investigations to a limited area. For a number of reasons the
Borough of Manhattan seemed to be the most profitable section of
the city in which to concentrate. In order to crystallize our
particular project we deemed it advisable to direct our efforts
to finding answers to the following questions: </p>

<p>1. To what extent is marihuana used? </p>

<p>2. What is the method of retail distribution? </p>

<p>3. What is the general attitude of the marihuana smoker toward
society and toward the use of the drug? </p>

<p>4. What is the relationship between marihuana and eroticism? </p>

<p>5. What is the relationship between marihuana and crime? </p>

<p>6. What is the relationship between marihuana and juvenile
delinquency? <br>
</p>

<p>In the course of our investigations, we have made extensive
use of subjective data obtained from those who were actual
smokers of marihuana and directly acquainted with its effects and
those who were not smokers, but, because of residence, occupation
or other interests, were acquainted with the general subject.<br>

<h1><a name="OLE_LINK2">Organization of Staff</a></h1>

<hr>

<p>In October 1939 Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine
designated Deputy Chief Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant
Edward Cooper, Sergeant Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph
Loures of the Narcotic Squad of the Police Department of the City
of New York to cooperate with the Mayor's Committee on Marihuana.
These police officials submitted a list of intelligent young
officers with a suitable background. From this list six officers
were selected: two policewomen, and four policemen, one of whom
was a Negro. They were: Mr. James Coen, Mr. William Connolly, Mr.
Benjamin Weissner, Mr. John Hughes, Miss Adelaide Knowles and
Miss Olive Cregan. These police officers were encouraged to read
literature on the subject of marihuana and to familiarize
themselves with some of the characteristics of the plant, as well
as of marihuana cigarettes. They became expert in detecting the
aroma of burning marihuana, and were thus able to recognize it
and to identify its use in a social gathering. </p>

<p>Regular assignments were made by the director of the survey.
At intervals each officer dictated a general report on his
activities and findings to a stenographer engaged by the
Committee. Frequent conferences were held in the office of the
director of the survey, at which time individual reports were
discussed in detail and evaluated. </p>

<p>An attempt was made to give the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; a
psychological approach to the performance of their duties. At no
time were these officers permitted to make known their activity
to other members of the police force, or to make arrests. This
arrangement was considered essential in order that they might
maintain an effective role of investigator without being in any
respect recognized as police officers. Although they were members
of the police force and constantly in contact with violators of
law, their immediate superiors cooperated to an extreme degree by
allowing the &quot;marihuana squad&quot; to report directly to
the director of the survey. </p>

<p>While on duty the squad actually &quot;lived&quot; in the
environment in which marihuana smoking or peddling was suspected.
They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dime-a-dance halls,
other dance halls to which they took their own partners, theatres
-- backstage and in the audience -- roller-skating rinks,
subways, public toilets, parks and docks They consorted with the
habitues of these places, chance acquaintances on the street,
loiterers around schools, subways and bus terminals. They posed
as &quot;suckers&quot; from out of town and as students in
colleges and high schools. </p>

<p>We highly commend these officers individually for their
exceptionally good performances. The aid given by Deputy Chief
Inspector Daniel Curtayne, Lieutenant Edward Cooper, Sergeant
Bernard Boylan and Detective Joseph Loures throughout deserves
mention and appreciation. At times we must have been a source of
annoyance to them, but our requests were always cheerfully met
and assistance heartily extended.<br>
</p>

<p>Method of Retail Distribution </p>

<p>In general, marihuana is used in the form of a cigarette.
Occasionally some individuals chew the &quot;weed&quot; and seem
to get the same effect as do others through smoking. The common
names for the cigarettes are: muggles, reefers, Indian hemp,
weed, tea, gage and sticks. Cigarettes made of marihuana differ
in size as do cigarettes made of tobacco: they are long, short,
thick or thin. </p>

<p>The price varies in accordance with the accepted opinion as to
the potency of the marihuana used in the cigarettes, and this
appears to be determined by the place of origin. The cheapest
brand is known as &quot;sass-fras,&quot; and retails for
approximately three for 50 cents. It is made of the marihuana
that is grown in the United States. Smokers do not consider such
marihuana very potent. They have found that they must consume a
greater number of cigarettes in order to obtain the desired
effect colloquially termed as &quot;high.&quot; This opinion,
expressed by smokers in the Borough of Manhattan, is at variance
with that of some authorities who believe that marihuana grown in
the United States is as potent as the marihuana grown in other
countries. </p>

<p>The &quot;panatella&quot; cigarette, occasionally referred to
as &quot;meserole,&quot; is considered to be more potent than the
&quot;sass-fras&quot; and usually retails for approximately 25
cents each. The hemp from which the &quot;panatella&quot; is made
comes from Central and South America. </p>

<p>&quot;Gungeon&quot; is considered by the marihuana smoker as
the highest grade of marihuana. It retails for about one dollar
per cigarette. The &quot;kick&quot; resulting from the use of
this cigarette is reached more quickly than from the use of
&quot;sassafras&quot; or &quot;panatella.&quot; It appears to be
the consensus that the marihuana used to make the
&quot;gungeon&quot; comes from Africa. The sale of this cigarette
is restricted to a clientele whose economic status is of a higher
level than the majority of marihuana smokers. </p>

<p>A confirmed marihuana user can readily distinguish the quality
and potency of various brands, just as the habitual cigarette or
cigar smoker is able to differentiate between the qualities of
tobacco. Foreign-made cigarette paper is often used in order to
convince the buyer that the &quot;tea is right from the
boat.&quot; </p>

<p>There are two channels for the distribution of marihuana
cigarettes-- the independent peddler and the &quot;tea-pad.&quot;
From general observations, conversations with &quot;pad&quot;
owners, and discussions with peddlers, the investigators
estimated that there were about 500 &quot;tea-pads&quot; in
Harlem and at least 500 peddlers. </p>

<p>A &quot;tea-pad&quot; is a room or an apartment in which
people gather to smoke marihuana. The majority of such places are
located in the Harlem district. It is our impression that the
landlord, the agent, the superintendent or the janitor is aware
of the purposes for which the premises are rented. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is furnished according to the clientele it
expects to serve. Usually, each &quot;tea-pad&quot; has
comfortable furniture, a radio, victrola or, as in most
instances, a rented nickelodeon. The lighting is more or less
uniformly dim, with blue predominating. An incense is considered
part of the furnishings. The walls are frequently decorated with
pictures of nude subjects suggestive of perverted sexual
practices. The furnishings, as described, are believed to be
essential as a setting for those participating in smoking
marihuana. </p>

<p>Most &quot;tea-pads&quot; have their trade restricted to the
sale of marihuana. Some places did sell marihuana and whisky, and
a few places also served as houses of prostitution. Only one
&quot;teapad&quot; was found which served as a house of
prostitution, and in which one could buy marihuana, whisky, and
opium. </p>

<p>The marihuana smoker derives greater satisfaction if he is
smoking in the presence of others. His attitude in the
&quot;tea-pad&quot; is that of a relaxed individual, free from
the anxieties and cares of the realities of life. The
&quot;tea-pad&quot; takes on the atmosphere of a very congenial
social club. The smoker readily engages in conversation with
strangers, discussing freely his pleasant reactions to the drug
and philosophizing on subjects pertaining to life in a manner
which, at times, appears to be out of keeping with his
intellectual level. A constant observation was the extreme
willingness to share and puff on each other's cigarettes. A
boisterous, rowdy atmosphere did not prevail and on the rare
occasions when there appeared signs indicative of a belligerent
attitude on the part of a smoker, he was ejected or forced to
become more tolerant and quiescent. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting setups of a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
which was clearly not along orthodox lines from the business
point of view, was a series of pup tents arranged on a roof-top
in Harlem. Those present proceeded to smoke their cigarettes in
the tents. When the desired effect of the drug had been obtained
they all merged into the open and engaged in a discussion of
their admiration of the stars and the beauties of nature. </p>

<p>Because of the possibility of spreading disease, note should
be taken of what seems to be a custom known as
&quot;pick-up&quot; smoking. It is an established practice
whereby a marihuana cigarette is lit and after one or two
inhalations is passed on to the next person. This procedure is
repeated until all present have had an opportunity to take a puff
or two on the cigarette. </p>

<p>Occasionally a &quot;tea-pad&quot; owner may have peddlers who
sell their wares in other localities and at the same time serve
as procurers for those who wish to smoke marihuana on the
premises. </p>

<p>One also finds other methods of retail distribution. After
proper introduction, one may be able to purchase the cigarette in
certain places. This is not an easy procedure, but it can be
accomplished. In some bar-and-grills, restaurants, and bars our
investigators were able to establish contact with someone who in
turn, would introduce them to a peddler who apparently made
regular rounds of these places in order to sell cigarettes. It
appears that the owners of such places are not aware of this
practice, and in many instances they would discharge any employee
known to be directly or indirectly associated with the sale of
marihuana. </p>

<p>On rare occasions public guides, if properly approached would
refer one to a place where the &quot;reefer&quot; could be
bought. There was no evidence that the guide received money when
acting as go- between. Terminal porters, mainly Negroes, appeared
to be more directly connected with the traffic of marihuana. They
were more conversant with the subject and it was easier for them
to establish contact between purchaser and peddler. </p>

<p>Marihuana smoking is very common in the theatres of Harlem
according to the observations of the investigators. We have
reason to believe that in some instances, perhaps few in number,
employees actually sold cigarettes on the premises. In the Harlem
dance halls smoking was frequently observed either in the
lavatories or on the main floor. The patrons as well as the
musicians were seen in the act of smoking. There was no evidence
of sales being made by employees on the premises, or that there
was any gain on the part of the owners or employees in permitting
this practice. Whereas the smoking of marihuana was not
encouraged, nothing was done to prohibit such practice. </p>

<p>There are specific sections in the Borough of Manhattan where
the sale of marihuana cigarettes appears to be localized: 1) the
Harlem district; 2) the Broadway area, a little east and west of
Broadway and extending from 42nd Street to S9th Street. While it
is true that one may buy the cigarette in other districts, it is
not as easily obtainable as in the two localities mentioned. <br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>The Mental Attitude of the Marihuana Smoker Toward Society
and Marihuana</h1>

<hr>

<p>Most of the smokers of marihuana coming within the scope of
our survey were unemployed, and of the others most had part-time
employment. </p>

<p>Occasional, as well as confirmed, users were all aware of the
laws pertaining to the illegal use of the drug. They did not
indulge in its use with a spirit of braggadocio or as a challenge
to law as has been reported by some investigators in other
districts. They did not express remorse concerning their use of
marihuana, nor did they blame this habit as a causative factor in
the production of special difficulties in their personal lives.
Except for musicians there appeared to be no attempt at
secretiveness on the part of the habitual smoker. This attitude
is in marked contrast to that usually taken by those addicted to
morphine, cocaine, or heroin. </p>

<p>The consensus of marihuana users is that the drug is not
harmful and that infrequent or constant use of marihuana does not
result in physical or mental deterioration. </p>

<p>In describing the most common reaction to the drug they always
stated that it made them feel &quot;high.&quot; Elaboration of
just what the smoker meant by &quot;high&quot; varied with the
individual. However, there was common agreement that a feeling of
adequacy and efficiency was induced by the use of marihuana and
that current mental conflicts were allayed. Organic illness was
not given as a cause for smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>A person may be a confirmed smoker for a prolonged period, and
give up the drug voluntarily without experiencing any craving for
it or exhibiting withdrawal symptoms. He may, at some time later
on, go back to its use. Others may remain infrequent users of the
cigarette, taking one or two a week, or only when the
&quot;social setting&quot; calls for participation. From time to
time we had one of our investigators associate with a marihuana
user. The investigator would bring up the subject of smoking.
This would invariably lead to the suggestion that they obtain
some marihuana cigarettes. They would seek a &quot;tea-pad,&quot;
and if it was closed the smoker and our investigator would calmly
resume their previous activity, such as the discussion of life in
general or the playing of pool. There were apparently no signs
indicative of frustration in the smoker at not being able to
gratify the desire for the drug. We consider this point highly
significant since it is so contrary to the experience of users of
other narcotics. A similar situation occurring in one addicted to
the use of morphine, cocaine, or heroin would result in a
compulsive attitude on the part of the addict to obtain the drug.
If unable to secure it, there would be obvious physical and
mental manifestations of frustration. This may be considered
presumptive evidence that there is no true addiction in the
medical sense associated with the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>The confirmed marihuana smoker consumes perhaps from six to
ten cigarettes per day. He appears to be quite conscious of the
quantity he requires to reach the effect called &quot;high.&quot;
Once the desired effect is obtained he cannot be persuaded to
consume more. </p>

<p>He knows when he has had enough. The smoker determines for
himself the point of being &quot;high,&quot; and is ever
conscious of preventing himself from becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; This fear of being &quot;too high&quot; must be
associated with some form of anxiety which causes the smoker,
should he accidentally reach that point, immediately to institute
measures so that he can &quot;come down.&quot; It has been found
that the use of such beverages as beer, or a sweet soda pop, is
an effective measure. Smokers insist that &quot;it does something
to the stomach&quot; and that it is always associated with
&quot;belching.&quot; A cold shower will also have the effect of
bringing the person &quot;down.&quot; </p>

<p>Smokers have repeatedly stated that the consumption of whisky
while smoking negates the potency of the drug. They find it is
very difficult to get &quot;high&quot; while drinking whisky, and
because of that smokers will not drink whisky while using the
&quot;weed.&quot; They do, however, consume large quantities of
sweet wines. It is their contention that this mild alcoholic
beverage aids the drug in producing the desired effect. Most
marihuana smokers insist that the appetite is increased as the
result of smoking. </p>

<p>We have been unable to confirm the opinion expressed by some
investigators that marihuana smoking is the first step in the use
of such drugs as cocaine, morphine, and heroin. The instances are
extremely rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
with addiction to these other narcotics.<br>
</p>

<h2>Marihuana and Eroticism </h2>

<p>In the popular agitation against the use of marihuana, its
erotic effects have been stressed repeatedly. As previously
stated in this report, our investigators visited many
&quot;tea-pads&quot; in the Borough of Manhattan. It is true that
lewd pictures decorated the walls but they did not find that they
were attracting attention or comment among the clientele. In fact
one of the investigators who was concentrating his attention on
the relation between marihuana and eroticism stated in his report
that he found himself embarrassed in that he was the only one who
examined the pictures on the wall. </p>

<p>Numerous conversations with smokers of marihuana revealed only
occasional instances in which there was any relation between the
drug and eroticism. At one time one of our investigators attended
a very intimate social gathering in an apartment in Harlem,
having succeeded in securing the position of doorman for the
occasion. </p>

<p>There was a great deal of drinking, and the dancing was of the
most modern, abandoned, &quot;jitter-bug&quot; type. This form of
dancing is highly suggestive and appears to be associated with
erotic activity. The investigator made careful observation of
those who were dancing, and found that there was no difference
between the ones who were and the ones who were not smoking
&quot;reefers.&quot; Similar impressions were received after
careful observations in public dance halls, places where they
knew that some persons were under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Visits to brothels which occasionally also served as
&quot;teapads&quot; revealed that the use of marihuana was not
linked to sexuality. These observations allow us to come to the
conclusion that in the main marihuana was not used for direct
sexual stimulation. <br>
</p>

<h2>Crime </h2>

<p>One of the most important causes of the widespread publicity
which marihuana smoking has received is the belief that this
practice is directly responsible for the commission of crimes. </p>

<p>During our investigation many law enforcement officers,
representing various federal, state and local police bureaus,
were interviewed and asked for a confidential expression of
opinion on the general question of crime and marihuana. In most
instances they unhesitatingly stated that there is no proof that
major crimes are associated with the practice of smoking
marihuana. They did state that many marihuana smokers are guilty
of petty crimes, but that the criminal career usually existed
prior to the time the individual smoked his first marihuana
cigarette. These officers further stated that a criminal
generally termed as a &quot;real&quot; or
&quot;professional&quot; criminal will not associate with
marihuana smokers. He considers such a person inferior and
unreliable and will not allow him to participate in the
commission of a major crime. </p>

<p>In the period beginning October 1939 and ending November 1940,
the Police Department made 167 arrests for the possession and use
of marihuana. Classified according to race they were: white, 33
men, 4 women; Latin-American, 26 men, 2 women; Negro, 83 men, 6
women; Latin-American (colored) 9 men, 1 woman- British East
Indies 1, Filipino 1, Chinese 1. Classified according to age, 12
per cent were between the ages of 16 and 20, 58 per cent between
the ages of 21 and 30, 24 per cent between the ages of 31 and 40,
and 6 per cent between the ages of 41 and 50. </p>

<p>During the period under discussion, the Police Department
confiscated approximately 3,000 pounds of marihuana. </p>

<p>The sale and use of marihuana is a problem engaging the
vigilance of the New York Police Department. However, the number
of officers available for such duty is limited. Officers
specifically assigned to the Narcotics Division of the Police
Department are acquainted with the problem, but the majority of
the officers are fundamentally without authoritative knowledge
regarding this subject. </p>

<p>The relation between marihuana smoking and the commission of
crimes of violence in the city of New York is described by Dr.
Walter Bromberg, psychiatrist-in-charge of the Psychiatric Clinic
of the Court of General Sessions, in an article published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association:<br>
</p>

<p>(start quotation) </p>

<p>In the south of this country (New Orleans) the incidence of
marihuana addicts among major criminals is admittedly high.
Sporadic reports from elsewhere in the country of murders and
assaults due to marihuana appear in the press frequently. It is
difficult to evaluate these statements, because of their
uncritical nature. The bulletin prepared by the Foreign Policy
Association lists ten cases &quot;culled at random from the files
of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics&quot; of murder and atrocious
assault in which marihuana was directly responsible for the
crime. </p>

<p>Among the ten patients, the second, J. O., was described as
having confessed how he murdered a friend and put his body in a
trunk while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>J. O. was examined in this clinic; although he was a
psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual, there was no
indication in the examination or history of the use of any drug.
The investigation by the probation department failed to indicate
use of the drug marihuana. The deceased, however, was addicted to
heroin. </p>

<p>Our observations with respect to marihuana and crime were made
in the Court of General Sessions over a period of five and a half
years. The material in that court is limited as to residence to
New York County, although it must be remembered that the
offenders come from many sections of the country and are of many
racial types. This is important, because the British
investigators have noted in India that cannabis does not bring
out the motor excitement or hysterical symptoms in Anglo-Saxon
users that occur in natives. There are several other difficulties
in collecting reliable material, one being the complete
dependence on the history and statements of the prisoners without
an opportunity for objective tests or other corroborative check,
as in the case of other drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine. </p>

<p>During routine interviews of some 17,000 offenders in six and
a half years, several hundred have been found who had direct
experience with marihuana. Their testimony checks with
experimental results and clinical experiences with regard to the
symptoms of intoxication, the absence of true addiction, and the
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this
noteworthy among sexual offenders and in cases of assault or
murder. The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press
that crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands careful
scrutiny, at least in this jurisdiction.... </p>

<p>Most of the narcotic cases in New York County are heard in the
Court of Special Sessions, where misdemeanants are handled and
where indictments on charges of the possession of drugs for use
are returned. In the Court of Special Sessions in the same
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 indictments for all
crimes, 6,000 resulted in convictions for the possession and use
of drugs. </p>

<p>Since neither the law, the district attorney nor the police
department makes any distinction between the several kinds of
narcotics in arraignments or indictments, there were no figures
from which to estimate the number of users of marihuana as
distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. A system
of sampling the 6,000 cases was therefore adopted in order to
furnish an approximate estimate of the total number of marihuana
users who came into conflict with the law. </p>

<p>In this sampling the records of 1,500 offenders, or 25 per
cent of the 6,000, were examined. Of these, 135 were charged in
connection with marihuana. From this fact it was estimated that
about 540 offenders, or 9 per cent of all drug offenders coming
to the Court of Special Sessions in six years, were users of
marihuana. In analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found
that 93 offenders had no previous record, the previous charges or
charges of 8 concerned only drugs, 5 had records including drug
charges and 29 had records not including drug charges. Among
those with longer records, that is, from four to seven previous
arrests, none showed progression from the use of drugs to other
crimes. </p>

<p>As measured by the succession of arrests and convictions in
the Court of General Sessions (the only method of estimation) it
can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal
careers. Similarly, in the Court of Special Sessions, only 8 per
cent of the offenders had previous charges of using drugs and 3.7
per cent had previous charges of drugs and other petty crimes. In
the vast majority of cases in this group of 135, then, the
earlier use of marihuana apparently did not predispose to crime,
even that of using other drugs. Whether the first offenders
charged with the use of marihuana go on to major crime is a
matter of speculation. The expectancy of major crimes following
the use of cannabis in New York County is small, according to
these experiences.(4) </p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana</b> </p>

<h1>Marihuana and School Children </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most serious accusations leveled against marihuana
by special feature writers has been that it is widely used by the
school children of this nation. These authors have claimed that
it has so detrimental an effect on development that it is a major
factor in juvenile delinquency. This phase of the marihuana
problem was deemed serious enough to merit primary consideration
in our study of the marihuana problem in New York City --
specifically in the Borough of Manhattan. We decided to attack
this aspect of the problem along the following lines: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To observe schools in order to see if pupils bought
        marihuana cigarettes from any peddlers operating in the
        neighborhood. </li>
    <li>To investigate thoroughly complaints made by parents to
        school and police authorities relative to marihuana and
        its use by school children. </li>
    <li>To interview principals, assistant principals, and
        teachers of many of the schools in New York City with
        reference to our project. </li>
    <li>To gather relevant statistics from various city bureaus
        and private agencies. </li>
</ol>

<p>Unknown to the school authorities, our investigators had under
surveillance many of the schools in the Borough of Manhattan.
They would observe a particular school for a number of
consecutive days, watch loiterers and suspicious characters in
the locality, and, under certain circumstances, follow some of
the children. This procedure was repeated at varying intervals in
different localities. From time to time the investigators would
return to some of the schools which they previously had kept
under surveillance. Attention was naturally concentrated upon
those schools from which emanated the most numerous complaints
and which were located in suspected neighborhoods. We must admit
that it would have been possible for such sales to have taken
place during the time that our investigators were not on duty,
but we came to the conclusion that there was no organized traffic
on the part of peddlers in selling marihuana cigarettes to the
children of the schools we observed. </p>

<p>Certain of the school authorities deserve special commendation
for their alertness in singling out suspicious characters
loitering in the vicinity of their schools. While investigating
one of the suspected schools, our investigators who were
loitering in the neighborhood were suspected and treated as
&quot;suspicious characters&quot; by the school authorities. </p>

<p>During the period of this survey the Police Department while
engaged in an entirely separate criminal investigation received a
lead indicating the sale of marihuana to children in a certain
high school. As a result, one pupil was arrested and convicted
for selling cigarettes to his classmates. </p>

<p>In the Harlem district we discovered a few places where school
children gathered during and after school hours for the purpose
of indulging in smoking ordinary cigarettes, drinking alcoholic
beverages, and engaging in homosexual and heterosexual
activities. </p>

<p>One of our investigators, having gained entrance to such a
place, ostentatiously displayed marihuana cigarettes which he had
with him. The madam of the place promptly cautioned him against
using the &quot;weed&quot; and insisted that at no time did she
permit any person to smoke it on her premises. </p>

<p>A surprising number of school children smoking ordinary
cigarettes were noted. A checkup revealed that these cigarettes
were being illicitly sold by men on the street and in candy
stores in the &quot;loose&quot; form. It is possible that this
trade in ordinary cigarettes is occasionally misinterpreted as
trade in &quot;reefers.&quot; </p>

<p>Interviews with school authorities were very significant, and
it is of value to summarize briefly some of the statements
actually made by them. The locations of the schools and the names
of the persons quoted are in our official files. </p>

<ol>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;The school has never had any connection with
        marihuana, not even a rumor.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal at first
        appeared to be evasive and did not readily volunteer
        information, but after repeatedly being pressed with the
        question stated that the school &quot;had not had any
        difficulty with the subject of marihuana.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal
        emphatically stated, &quot;I have had no trouble with
        marihuana in my school.&quot; </li>
    <li>A vocational school in the Borough of Queens. Mixed.
        &quot;I have never heard the slightest thing about
        marihuana in connection with this school.&quot; </li>
    <li>High School. Queens. Mixed. &quot;We never had the
        slightest connection with marihuana in any way.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Harlem. Predominantly Negro and
        Latin-American. The principal stated that there had been
        a few marihuana cases among the boys about eighteen
        months ago. His assistant volunteered the information
        that there had been some boys in the school who had
        &quot;reefers&quot; in their possession. On other
        occasions some of the boys appeared to be intoxicated and
        when examined confessed to having smoked
        &quot;reefers.&quot; He further stated, &quot;It was
        difficult to be sure if sleepy, perspiring,
        pallid-looking boys were feeling the effects of marihuana
        or were just recovering from too much 'partying' or
        drinking.&quot; He volunteered the opinion that since
        marihuana was an acute problem among the adult population
        in that particular district, it could be assumed that
        marihuana could occasionally become a problem in the
        school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Latin-American. On the
        fringe of Harlem. Principal and assistant principal
        stated that they have never had the slightest difficulty
        arising from marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and Negro. Bordering on Harlem.
        The principal, because of his short tenure of office, was
        unable to express his opinion on the subject. The chief
        clerk stated that marihuana had never been a problem in
        the school. She was certain, however, that it was sold in
        the neighborhood. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White, with a high percentage of
        Negro and Latin-American. The principal stated, &quot;As
        yet we have had no contact with marihuana although,
        considering the neighborhood, it would not be
        unlikely.&quot; </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American, Negro, and some
        white. The principal stated, &quot;We have had no trouble
        with marihuana.&quot; He was of the opinion that because
        of the locality it would be possible for some older boys
        to smoke it without anybody being cognizant of it. He
        added that he would let us know if any boys were detected
        smoking. During the period of the survey no such report
        was made. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Latin-American predominating. The
        principal stated that she had not had any trouble with
        marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White predominating. The principal
        stated, &quot;I have had no contact with it.&quot;
        However, due to the location of the school, which was
        near Harlem, she stated she would notify the Juvenile Aid
        Bureau if such a problem arose. During the period of the
        survey no such report was received. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that no
        information concerning the use of any narcotics had ever
        come to his attention and was equally insistent that
        teachers would have reported any such information to him.
    </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that she
        had never found anything to indicate the use of any drug
        in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White and mixed. The principal stated
        that last year he had suspected that a group of chronic
        truants were using marihuana but he was unable to obtain
        any direct evidence. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal and his
        assistant stated that they had no real evidence of any
        marihuana problem in the school, and they do not believe
        that the drug is used to any extent. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        although she had no tangible evidence of marihuana
        smoking among the students, she has problem groups that
        gather in premises where she is inclined to think that
        marihuana could be obtained if they wished to get it. She
        is certain no marihuana is used in the school itself. We
        investigated thoroughly the suggestions made by the
        principal as to premises where marihuana might be sold
        but we were unable to gather any evidence of its sale. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The acting principal and a
        teacher in the school who had been there for a number of
        years stated that there had never been any evidence of
        the use of marihuana or any other drugs in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The health director of this
        school stated that any evidence concerning the use of
        narcotics by pupils would have been called to his
        attention, but none had been. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had been no traces of marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The authorities stated that
        there had never been the slightest suggestion of
        marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The assistant principal stated
        that he knew of no marihuana problem in the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        because of the publicity given to marihuana smoking she
        had been on the alert to discover indications of its use
        in her school but had found no evidence of marihuana in
        the school or of anything that would lead her to believe
        that any one of her students used marihuana outside of
        the school. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. White. The principal stated that
        nothing pertaining to the use of narcotics had been
        reported to him in all the years he had been there. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. Authorities, including
        the medical department, stated that no student had ever
        been reported for being under the influence of marihuana.
    </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. The principal stated,
        &quot;There is no indication of a marihuana problem in
        the school.&quot; </li>
    <li>Grammar School. The principal stated that anonymous
        letters had been received from time to time from pupils
        in the school in reference to marihuana. One letter was
        actually signed by a pupil of the school, who reported
        the sale of marihuana in a candy store in the vicinity.
        The principal with held the name of the pupil but
        requested us to investigate the report. We kept this
        school, the immediate neighborhood, and all candy stores
        in the vicinity under strict surveillance, but were
        unable to gather any evidence which would indicate that
        the pupils of this school were obtaining marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Queens. The assistant
        principal stated that he had never heard anything about
        marihuana being a problem in his school. We had received
        a complaint about this school and one of our
        investigators had an informal chat with one of the
        teachers of this school who, because of her interest in
        the school children, appeared to be more conversant than
        anyone else with general problems at the school. She
        stated that she was certain marihuana was used by some of
        the students. She elaborated on the subject and recalled
        that a few months prior to the interview she had sent
        home five students (three Negroes and two Italians) whom
        she had noticed acting &quot;dopey&quot; in the classroom
        after the noon recess. She was not positive they were
        under the influence of marihuana but was fairly certain
        that they were under the influence of some drug. A
        student had told her that these boys used
        &quot;reefers&quot; and, noticing their stupor, she had
        concluded that they were under the influence of
        marihuana. Superficial examination showed her that their
        condition was not due to drinking whisky or any alcoholic
        beverage. In this school it was not necessary to notify
        the principal if a student was sent home. The teacher did
        so on her own account, arriving at a diagnosis without
        informing the principal of the condition. There was no
        doctor or nurse to examine the students. </li>
    <li>Grammar School. Negro. The principal and the social
        worker attached to this school stated that some time
        prior to the interview they had heard that cigarettes
        were being sold to children in Harlem. We were told of a
        certain man who was suspected of selling them to the
        children. The social worker was certain that a year
        before the interview marihuana cigarettes were sold on a
        certain street in Harlem to school children, but she had
        no knowledge as to whether the condition existed at the
        time of our investigation. While working on another part
        of the survey, we interviewed a young Negress,
        approximately 20 years of age, who was a marihuana
        smoker. She stated that she and another girl started to
        smoke marihuana cigarettes while attending this
        particular school. </li>
    <li>High School. Mixed, predominantly white. The principal
        stated that he was positive that there was no marihuana
        problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. Predominantly white. A student was arrested
        for selling marihuana cigarettes to other pupils. We kept
        this school under surveillance after the arrest. Although
        we heard rumors that the sale of marihuana would start
        again, we were unable to gather any evidence of this. Our
        investigators attended the dance of the graduating class
        of this school at one of the hotels in the city. The
        dance was well conducted and had a large attendance.
        There was no evidence of smoking at this affair. The
        principal was cooperating with the Juvenile Aid Bureau of
        the Police Department in conducting the investigation of
        the marihuana problem in his school. </li>
    <li>High School. White and Negro. Although rumor is
        widespread that &quot;reefer&quot; smoking is common at
        this school, thorough investigation did not produce
        evidence of it at the time of our investigation. We did
        obtain information, which we consider authoritative, that
        in 1935 a man was offered the concession to sell
        marihuana cigarettes to the students of this school. He
        refused the offer. The principal of this school stated
        that there had never been any trouble as a result of
        marihuana smoking and he knew of no actual cases. </li>
    <li>High School. White, Negro, and Latin-American. The
        director of health education, who was conversant with the
        subject, stated that the school had no problem with
        regard to marihuana smoking on the premises but that a
        Puerto Rican student who lived in Harlem had informed him
        that he could obtain marihuana cigarettes in his
        locality. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. We did
        not interview the authorities. Observation of the be
        havior of and conversation with students did not reveal
        any marihuana problem. </li>
    <li>College. White, some Negroes and Latin-Americans. This
        college is located near one of the famous
        &quot;tea-pads&quot; of Harlem. Many of the students pass
        the house regularly. Continued observation did not reveal
        any student attendance. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. Most of the boys of this
        school were familiar with the subject of marihuana. The
        pupils of the school are incessant smokers of ordinary
        cigarettes. We were unable to obtain any information
        which would indicate that they used &quot;reefers.&quot;
        Some students were observed entering a house in which
        there was a &quot;tea-pad,&quot; but we never found any
        of the occupants of this &quot;tea-pad&quot; to be pupils
        of the school. The counselor at the school stated that
        during the previous term there were suspicions regarding
        the use of marihuana. </li>
    <li>Junior High School. Negro. The principal, who is
        considered qualified to discuss this subject, stated that
        for the three months prior to the interview there had
        been no marihuana problem. She ventured the opinion that
        a few cases do arise in the spring and summer.
        Observation of this school reveals that practically every
        day young boys between the ages of 18 and 20 loitered
        near the gates of the schoolyard at the close of the
        session. Some of these boys were known to our
        investigators as &quot;reefer&quot; smokers, and they
        associated with the girls of the school. Two young girls
        known by our investigators to be &quot;reefer&quot;
        smokers stated that they started to smoke marihuana while
        at that school. </li>
    <li>High School. White, many Negroes and Latin-Americans.
        Many students smoked ordinary tobacco cigarettes.
        Numerous complaints and rumors were associated with this
        school. The principal stated that in 1934 they had an
        acute marihuana problem but that at the present time they
        did not think it existed. They are constantly on guard,
        especially at the beginning of a term, because they get
        many new students from the Harlem district. We are of the
        opinion that there are definite signs indicating that
        there is some marihuana smoking in the school. </li>
    <li>High School. Negro and white. The principal of this
        school stated that they did not have a marihuana problem.
        We are certain, however, that this school does to some
        extent present an acute problem for we have observed a
        few students smoking &quot;reefers&quot; away from the
        school. We have reason to believe that some of them smoke
        it while at school. The girls attending this high school
        have a very low moral standard. </li>
</ol>

<p>On the basis of the above statements and findings, we feel
justified in concluding that although marihuana smoking may be
indulged in by small numbers of students in certain schools of
New York City, it is apparently not a widespread or largescale
practice. In the belief that actual facts concerning the role
played by marihuana in the production of juvenile delinquency
could best be revealed in the records of the Children's Court of
New York City, we interviewed the proper authorities on this
subject. On the basis of the Children's Court records for 1939,
marihuana is not an important factor in the development of
delinquency. </p>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report - Sociological Study </h1>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<hr>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
        but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be
        in other sections of the United States. </li>
    <li>The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
        compared to other localities. </li>
    <li>The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
        purchasing power of most persons. </li>
    <li>The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
        Harlem. </li>
    <li>The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
        Latin-Americans. </li>
    <li>The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
        the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </li>
    <li>The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word. </li>
    <li>The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
        control of any single organized group. </li>
    <li>The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin
        or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a
        market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of
        marihuana smoking. </li>
    <li>Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
        of major crimes. </li>
    <li>Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school
        children. </li>
    <li>Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
        of smoking marihuana. </li>
    <li>The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
        marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. </li>
</ol>

<h1>The LaGuardia Report </h1>

<h1>THE CLINICAL STUDY</h1>

<h2>PLAN AND SCOPE</h2>

<hr>

<p>Interest in the effects of marihuana on the human subject
follows two main lines: first, concerning what may be called
pleasurable effects which account for its widespread use- and
second, regarding undesirable effects, including those leading to
criminal and other antisocial acts. </p>

<p>In his monograph on marihuana, Walton has reviewed at length
the literature on hashish experience. He has grouped these
descriptions as retrospective accounts by professional writers
and physicians who have taken the drug through curiosity or
scientific interest, reports by physicians concerning patients
who have taken excessive doses, and observations by psychiatrists
on subjects under marihuana influence. In all of these instances
a dose toxic to the individual had been taken and the effects
described correspond to psychotic episodes of greater or less
degree. </p>

<p>In the literature there are commonly described two basic types
of effect, one of excitation, psychic exaltation, and inner
joyousness, with divorcement from the external world; the other a
state of anxiety with fear of consequences, such as death or
insanity. Either one of these types of reaction may be
experienced alone, but usually both are present during the
intoxication. They occur in no regular sequence but replace each
other in rapid succession. The euphoric and anxiety states are
generally accompanied by mental confusion, a rapid flow of
dissociated ideas, and a feeling of prolongation of time and
spatial distortion. Sexual desires or phantasies may also occur. </p>

<p>The detailed descriptions of the experience vary. Those given
by trained writers, such as Ludlow and Bayard Taylor, are vivid
and dramatic, embodying sensual, visual, and auditory
illusions-phantasies of overpowering splendor and beauty, on the
one hand, and intense suffering and horror on the other. The
authors, familiar with stories of hashish effects and gifted with
strong imaginative powers, undoubtedly were expectant of much
that happened. The account given by the eminent Philadelphia
physician, H. C. Wood, while following the same general pattern,
has much less embellishment. He describes a feeling of well-being
and inner joyousness and buoyancy and the performance of antics
which he knew to be foolish but was unable to control. He was
able to recall no illusions or hallucinations. Later a state of
anxiety came on, developing into an overpowering fear of death. </p>

<p>A number of studies by psychiatrists on selected subjects have
been reported. An excellent example is that of Kant and Krapf.
Each acted as subject for the other and the effects of marihuana
are described and analyzed at length. In general, the objective
in such studies is the interpretation of the reactions in terms
of disturbances in psychological processes and functionings. The
descriptions referred to have been given by persons of a higher
social class, well educated and accustomed by training to act in
conformity with conventional social behavior. Although a state of
irritability may occur and threats of suicide be made by
individuals of this type under toxic doses of marihuana, it is
noteworthy that in none of the descriptions is there found an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior which led to acts
of violence or what would be called criminal conduct. </p>

<p>Of more direct interest are the publications of Walter
Bromberg, psychiatrist, Bellevue Hospital,
Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic, Court of General
Sessions of New York County. Marihuana users who are brought
before the court or admitted to the hospital come under his
observation and he has reported at length on the psychiatric
observations of 29 of these who showed psychotic reactions. He
describes two types of reactions, one an acute marihuana
intoxication with a psychotic syndrome, the other a toxic
psychosis. Acute intoxication occurs in any individual if the
marihuana is taken in sufficiently large doses. It comes on
promptly and passes off some hours later. In marihuana psychosis,
the symptoms are much more severe and of longer duration. He
describes a number of cases in which the psychotic state
continued for a number of days and required hospitalization. </p>

<p>The toxic psychosis seen in marihuana users occurs at any time
and is of indefinite duration. Bromberg states that the
relationship between cannabis and the onset of a functional
psychotic state is not always clear. The personality factor is of
undoubted importance and other toxic agents, such as alcohol and
other drugs, as well as endogenous elements, may be involved. The
symptoms, except for the longer duration, resemble those observed
in persons under marihuana intoxication, but often take on the
characteristics seen in schizophrenic or manic- depressive
psychosis. </p>

<p>A description of 11 cases admitted to Bellevue Hospital is
given for illustration. The marihuana was taken in the form of
cigarettes. In this group were 5 Negroes, 2 of whom were women, 1
Puerto Rican, and 5 whites, one of whom was a Mexican and another
a boy of 16. Except for one of the whites, a homosexual, they
were all of a low intellectual and social order. One of the
Negroes was arrested for following women in Central Park. The
others were admitted at their own request, or were sent in by the
police or family. Three of the group had definite sexual
stimulation but in none was there an outburst in the form of an
attack on women. The Puerto Rican became confused and excited and
began chasing people with an ice pick. Shortly after his
discharge he was readmitted to the hospital, was diagnosed as
definitely psychotic, and was transferred to a state hospital as
a schizophrenic. The majority of the group, 8 in fact, had
psychopathic personalities and 3 of these were transferred to
state institutions for further care. The group as a whole is
representative of those who come into the hands of the police
because of abnormal conduct and who are the source of the
sensational newspaper and magazine stories. </p>

<p>Bromberg's findings concerning the lack of a positive
relationship between marihuana and crime are described in the
sociological section of this study. </p>

<p>In marihuana literature, the action of the drug is usually
described from retrospective observation of the effects on a
single individual. Relationship to varying dosage, to the
subject's personality and background, to environmental conditions
when the drug was taken, is given little if any attention. It is
the lack of information concerning these and other factors
involved in marihuana reaction which has given rise to the
present confusion regarding its effects. </p>

<p>The clinical study here described was designed to afford
information not found in marihuana literature but necessary for
any comprehensive view of marihuana action. For obtaining this
information there were these requisites: an adequate number of
subjects for the study, a clear understanding of the mental and
physical make-up of each subject, a uniformity of environmental
factors, accurately graded dosage of marihuana, and standardized
methods of obtaining and recording marihuana effects. In addition
to defining the usual and unusual effects of marihuana, as shown
by subjective and objective symptoms and alterations in behavior
and in physical reaction, the study was expected to answer
questions which must arise in consideration of the problem as a
whole. Of special importance are these: Do marihuana users show
fundamental traits differentiating them from non-users? Do users
present evidence of psychological or physical damage directly
attributable to the drug? What are the pleasurable effects which
account for the widespread usage of marihuana? To what extent
does it lead to antisocial or dangerous behavior? </p>

<p>The sections covering the clinical study are under the
following headings: </p>

<p><b>A. Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Symptoms and Behavior </p>

<p>2. Organic and Systemic Functions </p>

<p><b>B. Psychological Aspects</b> </p>

<p>1. Psychophysical and Other Functions </p>

<p>2. Intellectual Functioning </p>

<p>3. Emotional Reactions and General Personality Structure </p>

<p>4. Family and Community Ideologies </p>

<p><b>C. Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the
Standpoint of Mental and Physical Deterioration</b> </p>

<p><b>D. Addiction and Tolerance</b> </p>

<p><b>E. Possible Therapeutic Applications<br>
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<h2>Organization for the Study<br>
</h2>

<p>The clinical studies were carried out at the Welfare Hospital
(1) a New York City hospital for chronic diseases on Welfare
Island. The quarters assigned to the study consisted of a ward of
eight beds for the group to be studied at any one period, an
adjoining ward of two beds for the study of individuals of the
group, three additional rooms with equipment for special
examinations, and a diet kitchen for the preparation of the
subjects' meals. </p>

<p>Four female nurses were employed and the subjects in the
larger ward were under constant supervision. In addition to
routine records, each nurse reported the behavior of the subjects
while she was on duty. Guards were assigned from the Department
of Correction and the New York City Police Force for the subjects
drawn from the Riker's and Hart Island penitentiaries and the
House of Detention for Women. </p>

<p>The facilities of the Third Medical Division laboratory were
used for general clinical laboratory examinations and for more
detailed study of organ functioning. For measurement of
psychological reactions, special apparatus was provided. A
description of equipment used for each division of the study is
given under its proper section. <br>

<h1>Subjects Selected for the Study</h1>

<hr>

<p>For the purpose of establishing a uniform plan of procedure to
be followed throughout the study, a test group of 5 individuals
who had had no previous experience with marihuana was selected.
These were volunteers who were paid for their services. They were
of a low socio-economic level, but classified as of better than
average intelligence. Only one of the group came within the range
of what is considered normal personality. They represented the
type of person who would readily take to marihuana were the
opportunity offered. </p>

<p>The main group, 72 subjects, was drawn from the inmates of the
penitentiaries at Riker's and Hart Islands and the House of
Detention for Women, all of which are under the supervision of
the Department of Correction of New York City. There were two
advantages in selecting subjects from this particular group;
first, they could be kept under continuous observation throughout
the period desired, and second, they constituted an excellent
sample of the class in New York City from which the marihuana
user comes. The subjects all volunteered for the study after
having its purpose and the part they were to take in it fully
explained to them. </p>

<h3>Race, Sex and Age.</h3>

<p>Of the group, 65 were males and 7 were females; 35 were white,
26 were Negroes, and 11 were Puerto Ricans. The ages ranged from
21 to 37 years except for one who was 45 and another who was 43.
Of the women, 6 had been opium addicts for a number of years. </p>

<h3>Previous Experience with Marihuana.</h3>

<p>Forty-eight of the group, including 6 of the women, gave a
history of marihuana smoking. The extent of the usage was
variable- for some it was occasional, while others had indulged
in the habit fairly steadily over a period of years. Of the 48
users, those who were sellers of marihuana were probably the most
consistent smokers, as in carrying on the traffic they would
endeavor to keep a stock on hand. But in any instance, the number
of cigarettes smoked during any stated period would vary
according to circumstance. Thus one user stated that he smoked
from 2 to 6 marihuana cigarettes a day, another from 10 to 15 a
day, another 3 or 4 a week, and another 5 or 6 a month. Those who
smoked daily are here classified as steady users, those who
smoked when opportunity was offered but not daily, as occasional
users.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 1)<br>
</p>

<p>The users had all been deprived of marihuana from the time of
their arrest, the shortest period being two weeks, the longest,
one year and ten months. They all stated that the habit had often
been interrupted voluntarily and the enforced discontinuation of
it had caused no discomfort. </p>

<h3>Health Record.</h3>

<p>The subjects were individually selected by Dr. Allentuck as
suitable for the study. A physical and neurological examination
at the hospital showed no evidence of disease. However, the
Wassermann and Kline tests gave positive results for 6 subjects
and the Kline test alone was positive for 2 and doubtful for 2.
These figures are consistent with those of the population from
which the group was selected. Of the 12,000 inmates of the
Riker's Island Penitentiary in 1940 and the 8,000 in 1941, 10 per
cent reacted positively to serological tests. </p>

<h3>Intelligence Record.</h3>

<p>Sixty subjects (40 users and 20 nonusers ) to whom the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was given had an average I.Q. of
99.3, range 70 to 124. The average I.Q. of the user group was
96.7, range 70 to 124, while that for the non-user group was
104.5, range 93 to 114. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution, the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. Of the 28 white subjects examined, the average I.Q. of
the 13 users was 106.1, range 77 to 124, and that of the 15
non-users was 106.3, range 96 to 114. The 19 Negro users had an
average I.Q. of 92.6, range 70 to 112, and the 5 Negro non-users
averaged 98.8, range 93 to 101. Although in the colored group the
non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users, it must be
taken into account that the number of Negro non-users tested was
small. The average I.Q. of the 8 Puerto Rican users was 91.0,
range 72 to 100; that is, they were very similar in mental
ability to the Negro users. From the results obtained from the
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test, one may conclude that neither
the users nor the nonusers were inferior in intelligence to the
general population.<br>
</p>

<h3>Marihuana Used<br>
</h3>

<p>The marihuana that was used for oral administration was
supplied by Dr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting Chemist of the United
States Treasury Department. It was in the form of an alcohol
fluid concentrate, the alcohol content ranging from 55 to 67.3
per cent and the content of solids from 22.9 to 33.6 Sm. per 100
cc. </p>

<p>According to the bio-assay made by Dr. S. Loewe of the
Department of Pharmacology of the Cornell University Medical
School, the strength of the fluid concentrate was found to be
from 71 to 90 per cent of that of the U.S.P. fluid extract for
cannabis marketed by Parke, Davis and Company. The fluid extract
was not miscible with water and had a characteristic,
disagreeable taste which made it easily recognized. For these
reasons the concentrate was evaporated to a viscid consistency
and made into pill form, with glycyrrhiza as the excipient. Each
pill was equivalent to 1 cc. of the concentrate. </p>

<p>For controls, glycyrrhiza pills without marihuana were used.
Several products prepared by Dr. Roger Adams in his investigation
of the chemistry of marihuana were used. A comparison of their
action with that of the concentrate will be found below. In
addition to the concentrate, marihuana cigarettes were used.
These were obtained from supplies confiscated by the New York
City Police. Each contained approximately from .4 to .8 gm. of
marihuana. As the quality of the marihuana varied and the amount
of active principles taken in with the smoke was unknown, there
was no exactness in dosage. In general, however, it appeared that
smoking 2 cigarettes was equivalent to taking 1 pill. </p>

<p>The minimal dose of the concentrate which produced clearcut
effects was 2 cc. During the repeated observations on each member
of the group larger doses were given, commonly up to around 8 cc.
and in one instance up to 22 cc. For smoking, from one to as many
as eleven cigarettes were used. </p>

<h3>The Active Principles.</h3>

<p>Determination of relative potencies of drugs having similar
action can be made on human beings to a limited extent only. The
comparison is based on easily measurable effects on some organ or
system on which the drug has a highly selective action, but the
existing state of the system influences greatly the ensuing
result. </p>

<p>Marihuana effects come mainly from action on the central
nervous system. The type and degree of response of this system to
stimuli of various origins vary in different individuals and in
the same individual at different times. When marihuana is given
the pre-existing state cannot be classified but it has influence
in determining the response, and the same dose of marihuana does
not produce identical effects in different subjects or in one
subject at different times. In general, however, when the dose
given is definitely effective the responses are of a fairly
uniform character. </p>

<p>For this reason the relative potency of the active principles
supplied by Dr. Roger Adams could be determined only
approximately. The principles used were the natural
tetrahydrocannabinol, the synthetic isomer, and the synthetic
hexylhydrocannabinol. These all brought on effects similar to
those of the marihuana concentrate. The estimate of their
relative potency is as follows: 1 cc. of the concentrate,
representing the extraction from 1 Gm, of marihuana, had as its
equivalent 15 mg. of the natural tetrahydrocannabinol, 60 mg. of
the synthetic hexylhydrocannabinol, and 120 mg. of the synthetic
tetra compound. In explaining the differences in the estimated
potencies, the rates of absorption must be taken into account
since the action of marihuana depends on the amount of active
principle absorbed and its concentration in the brain at a
certain time. </p>

<p>The main conclusion is that the action of the marihuana
concentrate is dependent on its tetrahydrocannabinol content and
that the synthetic compounds retain the action of the natural
principle. </p>

<h3>Procedure<br>
</h3>

<p>The procedure for examining the main group of subjects was
adopted in the light of the experience gained from the
preliminary study. </p>

<p>The subjects were brought to the hospital in groups of from
six to ten, and they stayed there from four to six weeks. Each
subject had his history taken and was given a physical
neurological, and psychiatric examination on the day of
admission. </p>

<p>Since it has been shown that pulse variation is the most
constant index of marihuana action, the pulse rate was recorded
every half hour during the day with the subjects at rest for five
minutes before each reading. </p>

<p>During the following days, through careful observation by the
Director, the general make-up of the subject, his personality,
the character of his responsiveness, and his behavior in new
surroundings were determined both before and while he was under
the influence of marihuana. Additional information came through
the nurses' reports. </p>

<p>In addition, each subject was given a series of tests before
and after the administration of marihuana in order that the
changes brought about by the drug might be measured. Included
among these tests were psychological tests for mental functioning
and emotional reactions, psychomotor tests for both simple and
complex psychophysical functions, tests to determine such
abilities as musical aptitude and the perception of time and
space, and laboratory examinations to test the functioning of the
various organs and systems of the body.<br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<p><b>Medical Aspects</b> </p>

<h1>SYMPTOMS AND BEHAVIOR</h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>IN PRELIMINARY GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The preliminary study of the 5 volunteer subjects had for its
purpose the establishment of methods of procedures to be followed
for the main group, and the obtaining of a general picture of the
physical and mental effects induced by the drug. Having no
knowledge of the safe limits of marihuana dosage, the dosage
given to this group was restricted to from 1 to 4 cc. of the
concentrate, and for smoking from 1 to 3 cigarettes. </p>

<p>When ingested, 1 cc. of marihuana was slightly effective, the
multiples of this more so. There was noted in all subjects some
increase in pulse rate and in blood pressure, dilated and
sluggish pupils, dryness of the mouth and throat, ataxia, and
some clumsiness and incoordination of movement. Symptoms
distinctly disagreeable were dizziness in 3 subjects, a sense of
heaviness of the extremities in 2, nausea in 2 and faintness in
2. Three showed motor restlessness. A state classed as euphoria,
characterized by laughter, witticisms, loquaciousness, and
lowering of inhibitions occurred in 3 subjects. This was not
sustained but alternated with periods during which disagreeable
symptoms were dominant. In one of the subjects (V.C.) there was
no euphoric state, but a feeling of discomfort and depression
throughout. Finally in one of the 5 (A.V.) with 2 cc. There was a
state of depression with anxiety and with 4 cc. a psychotic
episode with fear of death. </p>

<p>With the exception of the one individual during his psychotic
episode, the subjects gave no evidence of abnormal mental content
at any stage of the drug action, the only change noted being a
delay in focusing attention on questions asked and difficulty in
sustaining mental concentration. While there was objection at
times to carrying out repetitious tests, there was no definite
refusal. There was no sexual stimulation giving rise to overt
expression. </p>

<p>With the cigarette smoking, ataxia and charges in the pulse
rate, blood pressure, and pupils corresponded to those following
oral administration. In only one of the subjects, however, was
there definite euphoria. The common symptoms were dizziness and
drowsiness. Two of the subjects found it difficult to
concentrate. </p>

<p>The duration of the effects of marihuana was variable. When it
was ingested, the effects usually passed off in from two to four
hours, but in one instance persisted for seven hours and in
another for fourteen hours. After smoking, the duration of
effects was from one to three hours. </p>

<p><b>IN MAIN GROUP</b> </p>

<p>The evidence of the effects of marihuana was obtained by the
subject's statement of symptoms and sensations, by the nurses'
reports and by the examiner's observations and interpretation of
changes in the subject's mental state and behavior. </p>

<p>The dosage of the marihuana concentrate ranged from 2 to 22
cc. and in each subject the effects of more than one dose were
studied. Dosage ranging from 2 to 5 cc. was used for the largest
number of subjects, and that from 14 to 21 cc. on only seven
occasions. It is known that marihuana intoxication may bring
about a comatose state, but no attempt was made to determine the
dosage required for this. The number receiving each of the
selected doses is shown in Table 2. </p>

<p>(TABLE 2) </p>

<p>While the duration of action and its intensity tended to
increase with dosage, this was not always the case and equal
doses did not bring about uniform effects in all those receiving
them. Thus, 3 cc. produced a striking effect in one individual,
much less in another in still another, 10 cc. produced less
effect than S cc. Such variations are to be explained by
differences in the mental make-up of the subject, and the
particular state of his responsiveness at the time when marihuana
is taken. </p>

<p>The number of cigarettes smoked ranged from one to eleven. The
smoking of a single cigarette took about ten minutes and up to
eight could be smoked in an hour. In smoking, increasing the
number of cigarettes usually increased the sensation described as
&quot;high,&quot; but here also there was no uniformity in
individuals or groups. </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, in dosages from 2 cc. up, its
actions became evident in from one half to one hour. The maximum
effects were seen in from two to three hours. These subsided
gradually, but the time of disappearance was variable, usually
three to five hours, in some instances twelve hours or more. </p>

<p>When marihuana cigarettes were used the effects appeared
almost immediately. After one cigarette, these had usually
disappeared in an hour. After several cigarettes had been smoked
the effects increased progressively in intensity and reached a
maximum in about an hour. In most instances they disappeared in
from three or four hours. </p>

<p><b>The Concentrate</b> </p>

<p><u>Behavior Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>The effects on the general behavior of the subjects taking the
concentrate were variable. If left undisturbed some remained
quietly sitting or lying, showing little interest in their
surroundings. Others were restless and talkative. Under the
heading &quot;Euphoria&quot; there are listed those marihuana
effects which give rise to pleasurable sensations or experiences.
These are a sense of well-being and contentment cheerfulness and
gaiety, talkativeness, bursts of singing and dancing,
daydreaming, a pleasant drowsiness, joking, and performing
amusing antics. The drowsiness, daydreaming and unawareness of
surroundings were present when the subject was left alone. Other
euphoric expressions required an audience and there was much
contagiousness of laughing and joking where several of the
subjects under marihuana were congregated. The occurrence of a
euphoric state, in one or another form, was noted in most of the
subjects. But except for those who were allowed to pass the time
undisturbed, the pleasurable effects were interrupted from time
to time by disagreeable sensations. </p>

<p>Quite commonly seen, as with the preliminary group, was a
difficulty in focusing and sustaining mental concentration. Thus,
there would occur a delay in the subject's answers to questions
and at times some confusion as to their meaning. There was,
however, except in a few isolated instances, no abnormal mental
content evident and the responses brought out by the examiner
were not different from those in the pre-marihuana state. </p>

<p>Altered mental behavior which would give rise to more concern
was seen in a relatively small number of subjects. In some this
took the form of irritation at questioning, refusal to comply
with simple requests and antagonism to certain of the examiners.
There was, however, only verbal and no active opposition in any
of these behaviors, caused by the subject's desire to be left
undisturbed and his disinclination to carry out certain tests
which in his pre-marihuana period he had considered tiresome and
meaningless. With this came antipathy to those conducting the
tests. </p>

<p>The occurrence of the disagreeable physical symptoms
accompanying marihuana action would naturally lead to a feeling
of disquietude and some alarm as to significance and
consequences. </p>

<p>This, however, was a prominent feature in relatively few
instances. A pronounced state of anxiety reaching a panic stage,
associated usually with fear of death or of insanity, was
observed only in those subjects experiencing psychotic episodes
and here the anxiety state led to pleas for escape and not to
acts of aggression. Even in the psychotic states there were no
uncontrollable outbursts of rage or acts of violence. </p>

<p>Some evidence of eroticism was reported in about 10 per cent
of the 150 instances in which marihuana was administered to the
group. The presence of nurses, attendants and other women
associated with the study gave opportunity for frank expression
of sexual stimulation, had this been marked. There was no such
expression even during the psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>In some isolated instances there was evidence of marked
lowering of inhibitions such as loud discharge of flatus,
urinating on the floor instead of in the vessels supplied, and in
one instance frank exhibitionism. In the last instance the
subject, who was not a regular marihuana user, had been arrested
on three occasions for indecent exposure. </p>

<p>The frequency with which significant changes in behavior
occurred is indicated in Table 3 </p>

<p>(TABLE. 3) </p>

<p>As used in Table 3, anxiety means the subject's expressed
worry concerning what might happen to him. Excitement, shown by
physical restlessness, muscular twitchings and jerky movements,
and loud talking, and some degree of antagonism are known to be
expressions of an &quot;alarm&quot; or &quot;fear&quot; state. </p>

<p>It is seen from this table that, except for euphoria, the
effect of marihuana was definitely more pronounced on the
nonusers. This might be taken as evidence of a persisting
tolerance to the drug in the user group, but, on the other hand,
it may have as its basis a feeling of greater apprehension in the
nonusers. Such a feeling would undoubtedly arise among those who
have had no previous experience with marihuana and are in a state
of uncertainty as to its possible harmful effects. </p>

<p><u>Physical Symptoms.</u> </p>

<p>Of the subjective symptoms, a feeling described as lightness,
heaviness, or pressure in the head, often with dizziness, was one
of the earliest and occurred in practically all subjects,
irrespective of dose. Dryness of the mouth and throat were
reported by over half of the subjects as was also a floating
sensation. Unsteadiness in movement and a feeling of heaviness in
the extremities were commonly experienced as was a feeling of
hunger and a desire for sweets especially. Less commonly noted
were nausea, vomiting, sensations of warmth of the head or body,
burning of the eyes and blurring of vision, tightness of the
chest, cardiac palpitation, ringing or pressure in the ears, and
an urge to urinate or defecate. </p>

<p>From observation by the examiner, tremor and ataxia were
present in varying degrees in practically all instances and in
all dosages used, as were also dilatation of the pupils and
sluggish response to light. </p>

<p>These effects were often present on the day following
marihuana administration. </p>

<p>The frequency of the more common subjective symptoms and their
relation to dosage is shown in Table 4. The figures are taken
from the subject's reports. </p>

<p>There is a tendency for the symptoms to be more frequent in
the non-users than in the users but the differences are variable
and in general not striking.</p>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>The Marihuana Cigarette </h1>

<p><b>(Look for the Jack Benny Jello Hour)</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>The Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>Smoking. When marihuana is smoked, there is, as has been
stated, no such accuracy in dosage as is the case when it is
ingested. The marihuana user acquires a technique or art in
smoking &quot;reefers.&quot; This involves special preparation of
the cigarette and regulation of the frequency and depth of
inhalations. In a group of smokers, a cigarette circulates from
one to another, each in turn taking one or more puffs. The
performance is a slow and deliberate one and the cigarette, held
in a forked match stick, is smoked to its end. </p>

<p>When the smoke comes in contact with the respiratory mucous
membrane, the absorption of the active principle is rapid and the
effects are recognized promptly by the subject. He soon learns to
distinguish the amount of smoking which will give pleasant
effects from the amount which will give unpleasant ones and so
regulates his dosages. Providing there are no disturbing factors,
as is the case in gatherings of small friendly groups or parties
in &quot;tea-pads,&quot; the regulated smoking produces a
euphoric state, which accounts for continued indulgence.<br>
</p>

<p>(TABLE 4)<br>
</p>

<p>The effect from smoking marihuana cigarettes was studied in 32
subjects. Of these, 20 were classed as users, that is, prior to
their arrest they had had more or less extensive experience in
smoking. In the study the smoking was repeated by each subject
several times, the number of cigarettes smoked within an hour
ranging from one to eight. </p>

<p>In all of the user group the smoking produced a euphoric state
with its feeling of well- being, contentment, sociability, mental
and physical relaxation, which usually ended in a feeling of
drowsiness. Talkativeness and laughing and the sensation of
floating in the air were common occurrences. These effects were
of short duration, from one to three or four hours after the
smoking was concluded. In none of these subjects was there an
expression of antagonism or antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>In the non-user group the effects were similar except that in
one subject a state of mental confusion occurred and in another
the main effect was a feeling of dizziness, unsteadiness, and
muscular weakness. Finally one subject showed effects entirely
different from the others. He smoked one cigarette and became
restless, agitated, dizzy, fearful of his surroundings, afraid of
death. He had three short attacks of unconsciousness. At one
period he had visions of angels, and for a few minutes a euphoric
state. The entire episode lasted a little over an hour, after
which he went to sleep. This subject had a similar psychotic
episode after taking 120 mg. of tetrahydrocannabinol. On seven
other occasions he had been given the marihuana concentrate or
tetrahydrocannabinol with no unusual effects. </p>

<p>Of the physical symptoms occurring with smoking, dryness of
the mouth and throat, dizziness, and a sensation of hunger were
the most common. None of these or other symptoms seemed to lessen
materially the pleasurable effects. </p>

<p>The effect of smoking on the 7 females, 6 of whom were classed
as users, corresponded to that on the male group. All showed
euphoric effects. One of the subjects was nauseated and another
was restless, irritable, and contrary. These effects were
observed in both of the subjects when marihuana was taken by
stomach. One of the users, euphoric after smoking 6 and 10
cigarettes, had a psychotic episode after 8 cc. of marihuana
concentrate. </p>

<p>Tea-Pad Parties. (This section on &quot;Tea-Pad Parties&quot;
was prepared by Mrs. Halpern.) In addition to the quantitative
data regularly obtained from the subject during the course of the
testing program, the examiner had opportunity to make diverse
observations of the subject's global reactions, which threw
interesting light on the general effect of the drug on the
individual personality. </p>

<p>When the subject became &quot;high,&quot; his inclination was
to laugh, talk, sing, listen to music, or sleep, but the
requirement that he solve problems, answer questions, or remember
drawings created an artificial situation, tending to bring him
&quot;down&quot; and spoil his pleasure. In order, therefore,
that the influence of the drug might be observed in less formal
circumstances and in a set-up more nearly like the customary
&quot;tea-pad,&quot; two groups of men were given
&quot;parties&quot; on the last night of their hospital sojourn.
The men were consulted beforehand, and the stage was set
according to their desires. They requested that nothing be done
until it was really dark outside. They brought the radio into the
room where the smoking took place and turned it to soft dance
music. Only one shaded light burned, leaving the greater part of
the room shadowy. The suggestion was made that easy chairs or
floor cushions be procured but the party progressed without
these. </p>

<p>The men were allowed as many cigarettes as they wanted. When
the &quot;reefers&quot; were passed out they crowded around with
their hands outstretched like little children begging for candy.
The number of cigarettes the men smoked varied, the range being
from two to twelve or thirteen. There were both users and
non-users in these two groups. The users of course were highly
elated at the prospect of getting much free &quot;tea,&quot; and
some of the non-users also smoked with genuine enjoyment. </p>

<p>In the beginning the men broke up into little groups of twos
and threes to do their smoking, or in some instances went off by
themselves. Smoke soon filled the atmosphere and added to the
general shadowy effect. After the initial smoking there was some
moving about- some men laughed and joked, some became
argumentative, while some just stared out of the window. The
arguments never seemed to get anywhere, although they often dealt
with important problems, and the illogical reasoning used was
never recognized or refuted by the person to whom it was
addressed. Gradually, as though attracted by some force, all
restlessness and activity ceased, and the men sat in a circle
about the radio. </p>

<p>Occasionally they whispered to one another, laughed a little,
or swayed to the music, but in general they relaxed quietly in
their chairs. A feeling of contentment seemed to pervade, and
when one man suddenly got a &quot;laughing jag&quot; they were
annoyed at the interruption. </p>

<p>In general, they gave the impression of adolescent boys doing
something which was forbidden and thereby adding spice to the
indulgence. Many of the adolescent personality patterns as they
appear in group activities were clearly observable here. There
was the eternal &quot;wisecracker,&quot; the domineering
&quot;important&quot; individual who tried to tell everyone what
to do, the silly, giggling adolescent and the shy, withdrawn
introvert. One forgot that these were actually adults with all
the usual adult responsibilities. One could not help drawing the
conclusion that they too had forgotten this for the time being. </p>

<p>Although urged to smoke more, no subject could be persuaded to
take more than he knew or felt he could handle. After about an
hour and half of smoking, the men were given coffee and bread and
jam and the party broke up. They all went to bed and reported the
next day that they had slept very well. </p>

<p>Another attempt at evaluating the effect of marihuana in less
formal situations was made in the following manner. The examiner,
one of the police officers and the subjects listened to Jack
Benny on the Jello Program at 7 o'clock Sunday evening. The
police officer noted the number of times the audience laughed,
and the length of time the laughter lasted. The examiner checked
these items for the subjects. The first time this was done
without marihuana; the following week the subjects were given
several &quot;reefers&quot; about fifteen minutes before the
radio program started. The results were as follows: </p>

<p>Without drug, the subjects laughed 42 times as against 72
laughs in the radio audience. The total time for all laughs was
63 seconds as compared with 139 seconds for the radio audience.
With cigarettes the subjects laughed 43 times as compared with 47
laughs in the audience, the total laugh time being 129 seconds as
compared with 173 seconds of laughter in the audience. Without
drug, the subjects laughed, roughly speaking, only half as often
and as long as the audience- while under the drug they laughed
almost as often and the laugh time was about 75 per cent that of
the audience. </p>

<p>It is obvious that under marihuana the subject laughs more
readily and for longer time intervals. This is probably due both
to the fact that things seem funnier to him and because when
under the influence of the drug he is less inhibited.<br>
</p>

<p><b><u>Differences Between Concentrate and Cigarette</u></b> </p>

<p>When marihuana was ingested, it was in the form of the
concentrate, containing all the active principles which are
soluble in the medium used. The relative proportions of the
principles present are unknown, and the effects can be assumed to
give a composite picture of different actions, the dominating one
being that of tetrahydrocannabinol. There is no information
available concerning the principles present in marihuana smoke,
and it is possible that some of those found in the concentrate
have been destroyed by the heat of combustion. The effects from
smoking correspond to those induced by tetrahydrocannabinol taken
by stomach, so it may be assumed that this principle is present
in the smoke. The rapidity with which effects occur after smoking
demonstrates the quick absorption of the cannabinol from the
respiratory tract and the short duration of these effects
indicates its prompt excretion or detoxification. When the
concentrate is taken, the absorption from the intestinal tract is
slower and more prolonged. For these reasons it is not possible
to make a precise comparison between the effects of the two forms
of administration. </p>

<p>In general the subject's consciousness of unpleasant symptoms
is more marked when the concentrate is taken and this may
interrupt or obscure the pleasant effects. The long duration of
action and the inability of the subject to stop it serve to
accentuate the physical symptoms and to cause apprehension
concerning what may happen. </p>

<p>The result of all this readily accounts for the irritability,
negativism and antagonism occurring. The lessening of inhibitions
is not peculiar to marihuana, for in a few subjects who were
given alcohol in intoxicating doses the behavior corresponded to
that induced by marihuana. </p>

<p>After smoking the main effect was of a euphoric type. Some
dizziness and dryness of the mouth were generally present but
were not pronounced enough to distract from the pleasant
sensations. The condition described as &quot;high&quot; came on
promptly and increased with the number of cigarettes smoked, but
it was not alarming or definitely disagreeable, and did not give
rise to antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>On the contrary it prompted sociability. The marihuana was
under the subject's control, and once the euphoric state was
present, which might come from only one cigarette, he had no
inclination to increase it by more smoking. When a considerable
number of cigarettes were smoked, the effect was usually one of
drowsiness and fatigue. </p>

<p>The description of the &quot;tea-pad parties&quot; brings out
clearly the convivial effect on the groups and the absence of any
rough or antagonistic behavior.<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Psychotic Episodes</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Psychotic Episodes</h2>

<p>What has been referred to as psychotic episodes occurred in 9
subjects, 7 men and 2 women. A description of the happenings in
each instance is given. (2) </p>

<p>(2) Throughout this section fictitious initials are used to
avoid any disclosure of the subjects' identities. </p>

<p>A.V. Male. Non-user. Given 4 cc. of marihuana concentrate.
About three hours later he became restless, tremulous, agitated,
fearful of harmful effects, suspicious of examiners. For short
periods he was euphoric. At one time he had visual hallucinations
of figures making gestures suggesting harm. He talked
continuously, mainly expressing fear. His answers to questions
were delayed but intelligent. </p>

<p>W.P. Male. Occasional user. Given 3 cc., repeated two hours
later. At first there was a euphoric state; later he became
resistant and negativistic. He showed antagonism to the examiner,
demanding to be left alone. He vomited twice. Throughout he was
highly excited and talked to himself. The effects in general
resembled those seen in a maniacal state. He returned to his
normal state in about three hours after the second dose. </p>

<p>F.D. Male. Occasional user. Given 4 cc. Five hours later he
became confused, disoriented and slow in answering questions.
There were periods of elation and depression with laughter and
weeping. The effects passed off in six hours. </p>

<p>R.W. Male. Non-user. Given 5 cc. Three hours later he became
disoriented with continued talkativeness and rapid shifting of
thought. He had fits of laughter and weeping, grandiose ideas,
some paranoid trends. He answered questions clearly but without
perseveration. He returned to normal after six hours. </p>

<p>I.N. Female. Occasional user. Also heroin addict for many
years. Given 8 cc. Three hours later she became confused and
anxious with periods of laughing and weeping. There were several
short episodes resembling hysterical attacks and dyspnea, pallor
and rapid pulse during which she felt that she was dying and
screamed for the doctor and for a priest. Throughout, her
response to questioning was intelligent but delayed. There was a
return to her normal state in three hours. </p>

<p>E.C. Male. Non-user. Given 6 cc. Two hours later he developed
a marked state of anxiety accompanied by a sensation of
difficulty in breathing. This began during a basal metabolism
test. In the Sanborn equipment used there is a nose clip
occluding nasal breathing and a rubber mouthpiece through which
the air is inspired and expired. During the test the subject
became confused, panicky and disoriented as to time. The anxiety
over breathing continued for four hours but could be interrupted
by distraction. He was then given 4 cc. more. The breathing
difficulty lasted five hours more. The condition here had
features seen in claustrophobia. Before the episode, the subject
had taken marihuana on five occasions in 2, 4, 5, 5, and 2 cc.
dosage, without any symptoms of respiratory distress. However,
after the episode he took marihuana on three occasions in 2, 5,
and 6 cc. dosage and each time the respiratory symptoms occurred.
A certain degree of nervousness was present but there was no
mental confusion. The subject realized that there was no physical
obstruction to his breathing and had learned that by
concentrating his thought on other lines he could keep his
respiratory difficulties in abeyance and would not suffer from
real anxiety. Smoking up to as many as thirteen marihuana
cigarettes did not bring about the respiratory effect. It
appeared then that the respiratory symptoms were precipitated by
the wearing of the apparatus while under the influence of
marihuana, and through suggestibility there resulted a
conditioning to the marihuana concentrate which was given
subsequently. </p>

<p>The description of these six psychotic episodes fits in with
many others found in marihuana literature. They are examples of
acute marihuana intoxication in susceptible individuals which
comes on shortly after the drug has been taken and persists for
several hours. </p>

<p>The main features of the poisoning are the restlessness and
mental excitement of a delirious nature with intermittent periods
of euphoric and an overhanging state of anxiety and dread. </p>

<p>Three other subjects presented the features of marihuana
psychosis. </p>

<p>R.H. Male. White. Age 23. Non-user. In prison for the offense
of living on prostitution. The family history was bad. His father
never supported his wife or family and there was continual
discord at home. When the subject was 9 years old the father
deserted the family. Three brothers received court sentences, one
for stealing a taxi, one for rape, and one for striking a
teacher. R.H. was a problem child at school and on account of
truancy and waywardness he was sent to the Flushing Parental
School. </p>

<p>He ran away from this school several times and was transferred
to the House of Refuge on Randall's Island. At the age of 16 he
was discharged. Since that time he had had two jobs, one for
three months in a factory, the other for four and one-half months
in the W.P.A. When he was 16 he was run over by a truck and was
unconscious for a time. After his return to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary from Welfare Hospital further questioning concerning
his past revealed that he was subject to &quot;fits&quot;
occurring once or twice every two months. During the attacks his
body became rigid and his mouth felt stiff. </p>

<p>The subject was admitted to Welfare Hospital for the marihuana
study on February 20th. After the usual program of examinations
he was given 2 cc. of the concentrate on February 27th and
February 28th. These doses brought on the symptoms of dizziness
and tremor and heaviness of the head and the state called
&quot;high&quot; which is characterized by periods of laughter
and talkativeness. These effects passed off in a few hours and
were followed by drowsiness and a sense of fatigue. On March 1st
at 1 p.m. he smoked one marihuana cigarette. Immediately
afterwards he became agitated and restless and suddenly lost
consciousness. He recovered quickly and stated that he had had
visions of angels and had heard choirs singing. Later he had a
second short period of unconsciousness. During the afternoon he
continued to be agitated and restless and had periods of laughing
and weeping. After he was given phenobarbital he went to sleep.
On the next day his only complaint was that he felt dizzy.
Following this episode he was given 4 cc. Of marihuana
concentrate on March 3rd and 2 cc. on March 10th and 2 cc. of
tetrahydrocannabinol on March 5th and 4 cc. on March 8th. The
effects corresponded to those seen after the earlier
administrations of 2 cc. doses of the concentrate. </p>

<p>On March 11th R.H. was given 5 cc. (75 mg.) of the
tetrahydrocannabinol at 11 a.m. and 3 cc. at 2 p.m. No unusual
effects were noted during the afternoon and he ate his supper
with appetite at 4:30 p.m. At 6 p.m. he became restless,
apprehensive and somewhat belligerent. He felt that something had
happened to his mother, that everybody was acting queerly and
picking on him. He continued to be agitated and fearful, refused
medication and slept poorly. This condition persisted and on
March 13th he was returned to Riker's Island. After four days
there he became quiet and composed. The psychotic state cleared
up completely. The resident psychiatrist's report was: Impression
1. Psychosis due to drugs. (Marihuana experimentally
administered.) Acute delirium, recovered. 2. Convulsive disorder,
idiopathic epilepsy. Petit mal on history. </p>

<p>H.W. Female. White. Age 28. Non-user. Drug peddler, serving
three years' indefinite sentence for unlawfully possessing a
drug. Her parents died when she was about 10 years old and she
was raised in an orphanage. At the age of 19 she entered a
training school for nurses, but gave this up after four months
and supported herself by prostitution. Her sister and her
sister's husband were drug addicts and through them she began
taking morphine and heroin, being, according to her account,
depressed and dissatisfied at the time. She continued using these
drugs up to the time of her arrest, a period of eight years. In
1938 she married a man who was also a drug addict, and engaged in
the drug traffic. </p>

<p>On May 7th she was given 2 cc. of marihuana. Aside from a
headache and a feeling of muscular weakness and uncoordination,
the effect was to make the subject feel gay and very good-natured
On May 8th she was given 3 cc. Of the concentrate and became
somewhat confused and unsteady, irritated and upset at carrying
out tests, and greatly worried about the physical symptoms. Five
hours after she had taken the drug the effects had largely passed
off. Six hours later, however, she became restless and agitated,
moving about constantly, and worried about past conduct. This
state continued for a few hours. On other occasions the subject
was given marihuana in doses of 2, 3, and 4 cc. Twice after the
administration of 3 cc. The general effect was of a euphoric
type, and after 4 cc. Had been given a state of sadness set in on
two occasions and one of euphoria on a third. Toward the end of
her stay the subject became depressed and moody, constantly
dwelling on the belief that she had committed unpardonable sins. </p>

<p>She was returned to the House of Detention on June 2nd,
transferred to the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue Hospital on
June 9th, and from there was sent to Matteawan State Hospital on
July 10th. On admission to the State Hospital she appeared
confused, retarded, apprehensive, and depressed. She had a marked
feeling of guilt. She began to improve in September and was
discharged, cured, in January. Since her return to New York she
reports at frequent intervals to the parole officer. She has
secured employment in a food shop and is to be promoted to the
position of manager of the shop. </p>

<p>The diagnosis made at the State Hospital was: Psychosis, due
to drugs and other exogenous poisons (morphine and heroin). </p>

<p>D.P. Male. Colored. Age 23. Occasional user. Sentenced for
unlawful possession of drugs. Since graduation from high school
at the age of 16 he had had no occupation. His criminal record
dated from his graduation. He was arrested in 1934 for disorderly
conduct and in the same year sentenced to Elmira Reformatory for
five years for second-degree assault. He was paroled in 1936, but
during the same and the following year was arrested three times
for assault or robbery. He was returned to Elmira where he
remained until his discharge in 1940. In August 1940 he was
arrested for the possession of drugs and sentenced to a
three-year indefinite term. He had served eight months of this
sentence when he was admitted to Welfare Hospital as a subject
for the marihuana study. </p>

<p>During his stay at Welfare Hospital, D.P. was given marihuana
in the form of a concentrate and as cigarettes on numerous
occasions. His symptoms and behavior corresponded to those
usually seen, lasting a few hours with no after-effects. When the
time came for his return to Riker's Island he urged that he be
allowed to stay at the hospital and assist in the study. Two
weeks after his return to the penitentiary he developed a
psychosis characteristic of schizophrenia. He was transferred to
Matteawan where the diagnosis made was: Psychosis with
psychopathic personality. </p>

<p>These three cases are of special interest from the standpoint
of the relationship of marihuana to the psychosis. The first
subject, R.H., had a definite history of epileptic attacks. After
smoking one marihuana cigarette he experienced an acute
confusional state which lasted a few hours. In the second episode
which lasted six days there was a more prolonged confusional
state. Epileptics are subject to such attacks, epileptic or
epileptic equivalents, which may be brought on by any number of
upsetting circumstances. In this case marihuana is the only known
factor which precipitated the attack. </p>

<p>The second subject, H.W., was a heroin addict of long
standing. During her stay in the hospital, in her retrospective
reports on her marihuana experiences there were usually included
expressions of worry and remorse at her failure to answer
questions or perform tests honestly, informing on the other women
in her group, and denials concerning a syphilitic infection she
thought she had had. Prior to this incarceration she had had no
prison experience. The mental picture developed from the study at
the hospital and at Matteawan and the subject's subsequent
history represent a fairly typical example of what is termed a
prison psychosis. </p>

<p>The third subject, D.P., did not develop his psychosis until
two weeks after he had been returned to the Riker's Island
Penitentiary. He had shown no unexpected effects from marihuana
and had hoped to be allowed to stay on at the hospital instead of
going back to prison to complete more than two years of an
unexpired sentence. At Matteawan this subject was considered to
have an underlying psychopathic personality. His case also may be
taken as an example of prison psychosis. With both the second and
third subjects, the exact role of marihuana in relation to the
psychosis cannot be stated. </p>

<p>Dr. Peter F. Amoroso, Commissioner of Correction of the city
of New York, has given us information concerning the prisoners
sentenced to the penitentiary at Riker's Island from whom our
subjects were drawn. During the year beginning July 1, 1941, and
ending June 30, 1942, there were 1,756 inmates in this
institution. They had received an indeterminate sentence, that
is, from a minimum of a few months to a maximum of three years.
Of this group, 175 were subjected to intensive study by the
psychiatrist because they were considered possible psychotic
cases, 117 were sex offenders, and 200 were miscellaneous cases
referred for mental observation, making a total of 492.
Twenty-seven of these cases were committed to state institutions
for the criminal insane, namely, 25 to Matteawan and 2 to
Dannemora. </p>

<p>Commissioner Amoroso, after reviewing these cases, writes as
follows: </p>

<p>&quot;The prison atmosphere may place a most severe strain on
those who are physically or mentally abnormal upon commitment . .
. Emotionally unstable persons find themselves during
incarceration denied the assertion and enjoyment of the basic
human urges and impulses and it is natural to expect, therefore,
that prison life may result in various types of explosions, such
as psychoses, neuroses, sex perversion, and even physical and
moral deterioration.' </p>

<p>&quot;I am indeed surprised that we had so little trouble with
our volunteers upon completion of their study and sojourn at
Welfare Hospital, and the few psychotic episodes that occurred
are exactly what we would expect in the whole group without
considering the administration and effects of excessive doses of
marihuana.&quot; </p>

<hr>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the study of the actions of marihuana in respect to
subjective and objective symptoms and behavior, the marihuana was
given a number of times to each of the subjects in the form of
the concentrate taken by stomach. The amount given ranged from 2
to 22 cc., in most cases from 2 to 5 cc. After marihuana was
taken, the systematic action became evident in from one- half to
one hour and the maximum effects were seen in from two to three
hours. They passed off gradually, usually in from three to five
hours, although in some instances they did not completely
disappear until twelve or more hours. </p>

<p>Of the symptoms occurring, a feeling of lightness in the head
with some dizziness, a sensation of floating in the air, dryness
of the throat, hunger and thirst, unsteadiness and heaviness in
the extremities were the most frequent. Tremor and ataxia,
dilation of the pupils and sluggishness in responsiveness to
light were observed in all subjects. </p>

<p>From observations on the behavior and responses of the
subjects, it was found that a mixture of euphoria and
apprehension was generally present. If the subjects were
undisturbed there was a state of quiet and drowsiness, and
unawareness of surroundings, with some difficulty in focusing and
sustaining mental concentration. If they were in company,
restlessness, talkativeness, laughter and joking were commonly
seen. A feeling of apprehension, based on uncertainty regarding
the possible effects of the drug and strengthened by any
disagreeable sensations present, alternated with the euphoria. If
the apprehension developed into a state of real anxiety, a spirit
of antagonism was shown. However, any resistance to requests made
to the subjects was passive and not physical and there was no
aggressiveness or violent behavior observed. Erotic ideas or
sensations when present took no active expression. </p>

<p>Six of the subjects developed toxic episodes characteristic of
acute marihuana intoxication. The dosage varied from 4 to 8 cc.
of the concentrate, and the episodes lasted from three to six
hours, in one instance ten hours. The effects were mixtures of
euphoric and anxiety states, laughter, elation, excitement,
disorientation and mental confusion. </p>

<p>The doses given were toxic to the individuals in question but
not to others taking the same or larger ones. Once the drug had
been taken the effects were beyond the subject's control. The
actions described took unusual expression because for the
particular subject at a particular time the dose was unusually
effective. A corresponding toxicity did not occur from cigarettes
for here the effects came on promptly and on the appearance of
any untoward effects, the smoking was stopped. </p>

<p>In three of the subjects a definite psychotic state occurred,
in two shortly after marihuana ingestion, in one after a two week
interval. Of the first two, one was an epileptic and the other
had a history of heroin addiction and a prepsychotic personality.
The third was considered a case of prison psychosis. The
conclusion seems warranted that given the potential personality
make-up and the right time and environment, marihuana may bring
on a true psychotic state. <br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>ORGANIC AND SYSTEMIC FUNCTIONS </h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The functions of the body organs and systems were studied in
the manner common to hospital practice according to the methods
and with the equipment in use at Welfare Hospital. The study was
designed to show not only the effects of varying doses of
marihuana but also whether subjects who had long been users of
the drug gave evidence of organic damage. The tests were made
before the drug was administered, during its action, and often in
the after period. </p>

<p>The heart and circulation, blood composition, kidney, liver
and gastro-intestinal function, and basal metabolism received
special consideration. </p>

<hr>

<h2>SUMMARY </h2>

<p>The most consistent effect of marihuana observed in this
division of the study was an increase in pulse rate which began
shortly after the taking of the drug, reached a peak in about two
hours, and gradually disappeared. In-a few instances a temporary
sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia was noted, but except for
these there were no abnormalities in rhythm. The increase in
pulse rate was usually accompanied by a rise in blood pressure. </p>

<p>There was in general an increase in the blood sugar level and
in the basal metabolic rate, quite marked in some subjects, but
in the majority the levels reached did not exceed the high normal
limits. </p>

<p>An increase in the frequency of urination was often observed. </p>

<p>There was, however, no appreciable increase in the total
amount of urine passed during the drug action. </p>

<p>Hunger and an increase in appetite, particularly for sweets,
was noted in the majority of the subjects, and the taking of
candy or sweetened drinks brought down a &quot;too high&quot;
effect of the drug. </p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting occurred in a number of instances,
diarrhea only during psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the blood showed no changes in cell count,
hemoglobin per cent, or the urea nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus
figures. The figures for the circulation rate and vital capacity
and the results of the phenolsulfonphthalein test for kidney
infection and the bromsulfalein test for liver function were not
different from those of the control period. The
electrocardiograms showed no abnormalties which could be
attributed to a direct action on the heart. In the few
observations on gastric motility and secretion no evidence of
marihuana action on these functions was obtained. </p>

<p>The positive results observed, increase in pulse rate and
blood pressure, increase in blood sugar and metabolic rate, urge
to urinate, increased appetite, nausea and vomiting, and
diarrhea, were not intensified by an increase in dosage, for they
could occur in an equal degree after the administration of any of
the effective doses within the range used. All the effects
described are known to be expressions of forms of cerebral
excitation, the impulses from this being transmitted through the
autonomic system. The alterations in the functions of the organs
studied come from the effects of the drug on the central nervous
system and are proportional to these effects. A direct action on
the organs themselves was not seen. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Psychological Aspects</h2>

<h3>PSYCHOPHYSICAL AND OTHER FUNCTIONS </h3>

<p>Robert S. Morrow, PH.D. </p>

<p>In this phase of the study an effort was made to determine the
effect of marihuana on various psychomotor and some special
mental abilities. Appraisal of these effects was made wherever
possible through the use of standardized tests. A number of
different tests were originally tried under varying experimental
conditions on the group of 5 volunteer subjects who had never
before taken marihuana. Only those tests were retained which, in
the course of this preliminary investigation demonstrated the
greatest potentialities. With the tests finally selected it was
hoped to measure the effect of marihuana on the following
functions. </p>

<p><b>FUNCTIONS AND CAPACITIES TESTED</b> </p>

<p>Static Equilibrium This was measured by means of the Miles
Ataxiameter, which is an instrument for recording body sway. The
subject remains stationary in the ataxiameter with his hands at
his sides and his feet together while a system of pulleys
attached to a helmet on his head records the direction and degree
of movement. The subject's score is the cumulative sway in all
directions measured in millimeters. This test was applied to each
subject for two minutes with his eyes open and two minutes with
his eyes closed. Each trial was followed by a rest period of five
minutes. </p>

<p>Hand Steadiness Hand steadiness was measured by means of the
Whipple Steadiness Tester which consists of a metal disk with a
hole 3/16 of an inch in diameter, connected in series with dry
cells, an electric counter, and a stylus. The subject was
instructed to hold the stylus in the hole for two minutes without
touching the metal sides. Each contact with the side of the hole
was recorded and the total number of contacts gave an index of
unsteadiness of hand.<br>
</p>

<p>Speed of Tapping Speed of tapping was measured in somewhat the
same manner as was hand steadiness. The Whipple Apparatus was
used, the tapping board replacing the steadiness disk and a
thicker and heavier stylus replacing the steadiness stylus. The
subject tapped repeatedly on the metal plate for two minutes and
the total number of taps was recorded on the counter, thereby
giving a measure of motor speed. <br>
</p>

<p>Strength of Grip The Collins Dynamometer was used to measure
the subject's strength of grip. Three trials were made for each
hand and the scores averaged. </p>

<p>Simple and Complex Hand and Foot Reaction Time Special
apparatus was constructed to measure simple and complex hand and
foot reaction time. To measure simple hand reaction time, the
subject was instructed to press down on a telegraph key and
remove his hand as quickly as possible when a red light appeared
on the board which stood directly before him. A Cenco counter
recorded the reaction time, that is, the time which elapsed
between the presentation of the stimulus and the response. </p>

<p>For the measurement of simple foot reaction time, the subject
pressed down on a pedal with his foot, removing it as quickly as
possible when the red light appeared. </p>

<p>For the measurement of complex (choice or discrimination) hand
and foot reaction time either a red or a blue light served as a
stimulus. The subject had no advance knowledge as to which color
light would appear. For measuring the response with the hand, the
subject pressed down on the telegraph key with the right hand
and, at the sight of the red light, moved the peg from the red
compartment into the center (neutral) compartment with the left
hand, then removed the right hand from the key; at the appearance
of the blue light, he moved the peg from the blue to the neutral
compartment. For measuring complex foot reaction time, the
procedure was similar to that for estimating the hand reaction
time except that the right foot and the pedal were substituted
for the right hand and the telegraph key. </p>

<p>Each subject made fifteen trials for each of the four
variations. </p>

<p>Musical Aptitude Musical aptitude was determined by means of
the Kwalwasser- Dykema Music Tests. The eight tests administered
were the tonal memory test, the quality discrimination test, the
intensity discrimination test, the tonal movement test, the time
discrimination test, the rhythm discrimination test, the pitch
discrimination test, and the melodic taste test. The sum of the
scores for these separate tests was used to give a total score
for musical aptitude. </p>

<p>Auditory Acuity By means of the Galton Whistle, the subjects'
limits of auditory acuity were gauged for both ascending and
descending frequencies. </p>

<p>The final score was the average of the results of three trials
in each direction. </p>

<p>Perception of Time An attempt was made to appraise the
subject's facility in estimating time by asking him to state
when, after a given signal, he thought the following intervals
had elapsed - fifteen seconds, one minute, and five minutes.
Several trials were given for each time interval and the average
of the results of the trials was taken as the final score. </p>

<p>Perception of Length Subjects were asked to estimate the
length of lines which were 3 inches, 5 inches, and 8 inches in
length and to draw lines of 3 inches and 7 inches. </p>

<p>The Subjects Fifty-four subjects were used in this part of the
experiment, 36 marihuana users and 18 non-users. The two groups
were equated approximately for the following factors: age,
height, weight, years of formal education, and number of arrests.
The age range for the user group was from 21 to 45 years with
27.9 years as an average, the age range for the non-user group
was from 22 to 43 years with 29.8 years as an average. The range
in height for the users was from 54 to 75 inches with a mean of
67.5 inches- for the non-users the range was from 60 to 71 inches
with a mean of 66.8 inches. Range in weight for the users was
from 123 to 178 pounds with 151.3 pounds as the mean, for the
non-users from 115 to 180 pounds with 149.5 pounds as the mean.
The schooling of the user group ranged from no education at all
to 10 years with a mean of 7.1 years, that of the non- users
varied from 6 to 12 years with a mean of 8.3 years. As regards
the number of arrests, the range for users was from 1 to 20 with
a mean of 5.1 and for the non-users from 1 to 15 with a mean of
5.3. </p>

<p>The two groups differed radically with respect to race. Of the
36 marihuana users, 11 (31 per cent) were white, 18 (50 per cent)
were Negroes, and 7 (19 percent) were Puerto Ricans. Of the 18
non- users, 12 (67 per cent) were white, 6 (33 per cent) were
Negroes, and none were Puerto Rican. </p>

<p>In addition, the user group was analyzed with respect to the
age when the marihuana habit was begun, the duration of the
habit, the number of marihuana cigarettes generally smoked per
day, and the period of deprivation. The variation of the habit as
already described for the entire group of users applies to the 36
subjects studied here. </p>

<p>Procedure The tests were first administered to the subjects
before they had taken marihuana, then about a week later when
they were under the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, and finally
another week later after 5 cc.(1) of marihuana had been
administered. On each occasion the psychomotor tests for static
equilibrium, hand steadiness, tapping, strength of grip, and
reaction time were repeated at hourly intervals for eight
successive hours in order that the time-effects of marihuana
might be determined.(2) The other tests, that is, those measuring
musical ability, auditory acuity, visual ) memory, and perception
of time and length were given to the subjects while in the
undrugged condition and from three to four hours after the drug
had been administered. The music tests were given under normal
conditions and after 5 cc. of marihuana had been administered,
but not under 2 cc. dosage. </p>

<p>In almost all instances the marihuana was given in the morning
shortly after breakfast and generally after a day when no drug
had been taken in order that &quot;hangover&quot; effects might
be avoided. For the most part the subjects rested and did little
or nothing except the prescribed tests on days when marihuana was
taken. </p>

<p>The equilibrium, steadiness, tapping and strength of grip
tests were given together on one day and the different forms of
the reaction- time test on another day. Ordinarily four or five
days elapsed between retests. </p>

<p>In addition to being tested after standard doses of the
marihuana concentrate had been ingested, 11 users and 9 non-users
were tested after smoking marihuana cigarettes.(3) The cigarettes
weighed from 4 to 8 grains each. Most of the subjects smoked five
cigarettes, two non-users smoked only three, and one nonuser
smoked four. The tests with cigarettes were given at
quarter-hour, half-hour and hour intervals. </p>

<p>(1) A dose of 5 cc. of marihuana proved &quot;too much&quot;
for many non-user subjects in the sense that ingestion of this
amount was often followed by nausea and general symptoms of
malaise which interfered with further testing. </p>

<p>For this reason the higher dose for non-users was sometimes
reduced to 3 cc. or 4 cc. In all, only 6 of the non-user subjects
took the S cc. dose. Accordingly, although the higher dosage is
referred to as S cc. it should be noted that the actual amount
used varied from 3 cc. to 5 cc. </p>

<p>(2) The scores for the first 25 users and 6 non-users were
obtained every half hour, but since there was little difference
between the half-hourly and hourly results it was decided to
record hourly scores only, except for the first half hour. </p>

<p>(3) A short experiment in which placebos were employed was
also tried on these subjects. An attempt was made to have the
placebos simulate the marihuana as much as possible but
unfortunately the placebo pills had a distinctive taste which
rendered them easily identifiable. The subjects referred to them
as the &quot;licorice&quot; pills or the &quot;blanks.&quot;
While the experiment was completed and resulted in some
interesting findings, the factors which might have invalidated
the results were so serious that these experiments are not
reported at this time.<br>
</p>

<p>Summary and Conclusions </p>

<p>1. The effect of marihuana on the psychomotor functions
depends primarily on the complexity of the function tested.
Simpler functions like speed of tapping and simple reaction time
are affected only slightly by large doses (5 cc.) and negligibly,
if at all, by smaller doses (2 cc.). On the other hand, the more
complex functions like static equilibrium, hand steadiness, and
complex reaction time may be affected adversely to a considerable
degree by the administration of both large and small doses of
marihuana. </p>

<p>2. The function most severely affected is body steadiness and
hand steadiness. The ataxia is general in all directions rather
than predominant in any particular axis. </p>

<p>3. The effects produced by larger doses (5 cc.) are
systematically, though not necessarily proportionately, greater
than those brought about by small doses. </p>

<p>4. The time required by the drug to exert its maximum effect
varies somewhat with the function and size of dose, but, on the
whole, time curves for both functions and dosages have similarity
of form The effect of the drug begins from one to two hours after
ingestion and reaches its peak at the fourth hour, after which it
declines so that by the eighth hour most of it is dissipated. </p>

<p>5. When marihuana is taken in cigarette form the psychomotor
effects are similar in character and trend to those observed
after the ingestion of the drug but they occur much sooner and
taper off more quickly. </p>

<p>6. The effects seem to be essentially the same for women as
for men, except that women are sometimes affected maximally at
the second or third hour after the drug is administered. In women
the return to the normal condition is in some instances quicker
and more abrupt than it is in the men. </p>

<p>7. Non-users generally seem to be more affected by the drug
when it is ingested than are users. 8. Auditory acuity is not
affected by marihuana. </p>

<p>9. There is no evidence that musical ability, of non-musicians
at least, is improved by marihuana. </p>

<ol>
    <li>The ability to estimate short periods of time and short
        linear distances is not measurably affected by the
        ingestion of marihuana. </li>
</ol>

<h1>INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING </h1>

<p><b>Florence Halpern, MA</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this phase of the study investigation was directed
primarily toward establishing the effect of marihuana on the
subject's intellectual functioning. An attempt was made to
determine what changes in mental ability occur under different
amounts of the drug, what direction these changes take, when they
are first measurable, and how long they persist. </p>

<p>TESTS Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test This test was used to
measure the general mental level of all the subjects. It was
chosen in preference to other available scales because it is the
only individual test of intelligence which has been standardized
on an adult population, takes into account both verbal and
performance abilities, and compares the individual with standards
established for his particular age group. It consists of ten
tests, five verbal and five performance. The verbal tests cover
the fields of general information and general comprehension, draw
on the individual's capacity for abstract reasoning and test his
arithmetical ability and his rote memory. The performance tests
also evaluate the subject's comprehension of social situations,
but here the results are independent of language. There are also
tests of the individual's ability to carry out a routine task, to
organize parts into a meaningful whole, to distinguish between
essential and unessential details, and to analyze and synthesize.
Army Alpha (Bregman Revision, Forms A, B. 5, 7 and Bellevue
Revision) This is a group test first used in the United States
Army in 1917 and 1918 when it was given to more than a million
recruits. It consists of eight tests: test 1, a direction test
which was not used in this study since the item does not appear
on all forms; test 2, a test of arithmetical reasoning; test 3, a
test of common sense in which the subject indicates which he
considers the best of three possible responses to a given
question; test 4, a.modified vocabulary test; tests. in which the
subject must mentally reorganize disarranged sentences and then
indicate whether the resultant statement is true or false; test
6, a test of numerical relations in which the subject must supply
the last two numbers in a numerical series on the basis of the
relationship between the first six numbers; test 7, a test of
analogies in which the subject determines the relationship
between two given words and then underlines one of four words
which is related to a third word in the same way; and test 8,
which on Forms A and B and on the Bellevue Revision is a test of
general information in which the subject is given a choice of
five answers to a question. On Forms 5 and 7, this test is a test
of directions. </p>

<p>Because this test has five alternate forms which are roughly
of equivalent difficulty it could be repeated many times within a
short time interval. It was therefore used to establish a curve
showing at what time following ingestion the marihuana has an
effect on general intelligence and on individual higher mental
processes. Pyle's Digit Symbol Test In this test each number from
1 through 9 is associated with a specific symbol, as, for
example, number 1 is associated with a square and number 2 with
an asterisk. The numbers and their associated symbols appear at
the top of the sheet of paper. Below the sample are rows of
symbols, five symbols to a row, followed by five blank squares.
The subject is expected to fill in each square with the number
associated with the respective symbol. With practice the
association bond between the number and the symbol becomes
stronger and the subject depends less and less on the model at
the top of the sheet. He is therefore able to work faster and his
learning rate is reflected in the increased number of squares
filled. Cancellation Test The subject is required to cross out a
specific geometric form wherever it appears on a sheet which is
covered with rows of geometric figures. This measures the
individual's capacity for carrying out a routine task. </p>

<p>Form Board Test The measurement of the ability to manipulate
concrete material in contrast to the verbal or abstract ability
determined by the Army Alpha test required the introduction of
certain form board tests. These were the Seguin Form Board, the
Two Figure Board, the Casuist Board, - the Five Figure Board,
Healy A, Triangle Test, Diagonal Test, all administered and
scored according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance Series. The
Seguin Form Board has ten blocks of various goemetric forms, to
be put in their appropriate places as rapidly as possible. Three
trials are given. The Two Figure Board has nine pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large cross and a large square.
Time and the number of moves are recorded. The Casuist Board has
twelve pieces which, when correctly placed, form three circles
and an oval. Time and errors are recorded. The Five Figure Board
has five geometrical figures which are formed by the correct
placement of two or three pieces for each figure. Time and errors
are recorded. Healy A has five small rectangular pieces which,
when placed correctly, form a large rectangle. Time and the
number of moves are recorded. The Triangle Test consists of four
triangular pieces which are fitted together in a board. Time and
errors are recorded. The Diagonal Test has five pieces of various
shapes which must be fitted together in a rectangular frame. Time
and moves are recorded. Kohs Block Design Test This is a
performance test which is less a test of manual dexterity and
more dependent on abstract intelligence than are the form board
tests. It correlates more highly with intelligence than do most
performance items and yet it is entirely independent of language.
Therefore, the individual who cannot express himself well or who
suffers from a language handicap is not penalized as he is on
verbal scales. The test consists of sixteen cubes each with a
red, a white, a blue, a yellow, a red-and- white, and a
blue-and-yellow side. A colored design which can be reproduced
with the cubes is placed before the subject and he is expected to
make it. Results are rated numerically, depending upon the time
consumed in execution. In this experiment two sets of designs of
equivalent difficulty were required- Designs IV, VI, and XIV were
selected for one series and V, VII, and XII for the other. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Although memory in itself cannot be considered a
measure of intelligence, it is essential to any intelligent
functioning and must therefore be included in any estimate of
intelligence. Three aspects of memory, namely rote memory, the
ability tof recall presented objects, and visual memory were
tested. The rote memory test requires the repetition of digits in
forward and reverse order as given on the Bellevue Intelligence
Test. Object memory was tested by exposing ten small objects for
three seconds and recording the number of articles the subject
was able to recall. Visual memory or the ability to reproduce
designs after a ten-second exposure was estimated by using the
designs and scoring technique from the Army Performance Test.
PROCEDURE The Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Each subject was
given the Bellevue Adult Intelligence test within two or three
days after his admission to the hospital and before any marihuana
had been administered. </p>

<p>The Army Alpha, Pyle's Digit Symbol, and Cancellation Tests
These tests were given as group tests to a total of 20 subjects.
The Army Alpha and Pyle's Digit Symbol tests were given every
half-hour, beginning a half-hour after drug ingestion. The Army
Alpha was continued for seven hours and Digit Symbol for five
hours. The Cancellation test was given every hour for six hours,
beginning one hour after drug administration. Eleven users and 9
non-users took the Army Alpha and the Digit Symbol tests, while 9
users and 11 non-users took the Cancellation test. Tests 2
through 8 of the Army Alpha require twenty and a half minutes for
actual performance while such preparations as the distribution of
papers and the reading of directions consume almost ten minutes
more, so that had the entire Alpha been given at each half-hourly
session, the subjects would have gone from test to test with no
intermittent rest period. For this reason the tests were divided
and the following schedule arranged: (table a)<br>
Each subject took three test series, one without the drug, one
with 2 cc. and one with 3, 4, 5, or 6 cc., depending on indi
vidual tolerance. A test series consisted of fourteen half-hour
sessions for the Alpha, ten half- hour sessions for the Digit
Symbol and seven hourly sessions for the Cancellation tests.
Because of the time factor, a series required two days for its
completion. The halves of a series were given on successive days,
and the different series a week apart. Thus for example, a
subject might take his first test series with 2 cc. on Monday and
Tuesday of one week; the following Monday and Tuesday the series
would be repeated with the subject in a different drug state (no
drug or S cc.); and a final series would be given the third week
with the subject in still another drug condition. </p>

<p>An effort was made to obviate practice effect by giving the
first test series to one third of the subjects without drug, to
one third with 2 cc., and to one third with 3, 4, or 5 cc.
However because of the necessity of increasing dosage gradually
this ideal presentation was not actually obtained. The following
gives the amount of drug administered to users and non-users at
each test series. </p>

<p>(table b) Since the various forms of the Army Alpha are not
absolutely equivalent in difficulty, their order of presentation
for any one group had to be identical in each of the three drug
states. However, for each of the three groups tested the order of
presentation was different so that all the difficult forms did
not come at the same interval, as is shown on the following page.
Kohs Block Design, Form Board, and Memory Tests Administration of
these tests differed markedly from those discussed above in that
no attempt was made to give them at regular successive time
intervals. Rather, they formed part of a battery of individual
tests given to various subjects under specific drug conditions.
For example, 5 cc. of marihuana would be ordered for a patient
for 8:00 A.M., and testing began as soon thereafter as the
patient appeared &quot;high,&quot; the state of
&quot;highness&quot; being judged by the subject's own statement,
his pulse rate, the condition of his pupils and other
physiological signs. </p>

<p>(table c) Kohs Block Design was given to each subject twice,
once without the drug and once with 5 cc. The test was taken by a
total of 21 subjects, 10 users and 11 non-users. Five users tools
the test first without the drug, S had their first trial with 5
cc. Of the non-user group 8 had their first trial without
marihuana, 3 with 4 cc. The average time at which the test was
given to the user group was three and a half hours after drug
administration, with range from two to five and a half hours. For
the nonuser group, the average time of administration of the test
was also three and a half hours after the drug was given, range
two and a half to five and a half hours. </p>

<p>The two series of designs (one series being Designs IV, VI and
XIV, the other V, VII and XII) were presented in such manner that
half of the subjects were tested on one series and half on the
other series while they were under the influence of marihuana.
Thus any difference in degree of difficulty between the two sets
of designs was canceled out. The weighted scores given on the
Arthur Point scale were used in evaluating the results. </p>

<p>Form Board Tests were divided into three batteries, each
battery consisting of the Seguin Form Board, one of the three
larger boards (Two Figure, Five Figure, or Casuist) and one of
the three smaller boards. Various combinations of boards were
used under various drug conditions in order to make the results
as comparable as possible. The following indicates the number of
times the various boards were used with different dosages of
marihuana. </p>

<p>From the results it appears that Gwyn Triangle was used too
often with 5 cc. and Healy A was not used often enough. </p>

<p>(table d) </p>

<p>Aside from the Triangle and the Healy A, the distribution of
boards in different drug stages was such as to obviate any
differences in degree of difficulty. Nineteen subjects, 10 users
and 9 non- users, took this test. The results were scored for
time and errors according to the Pintner-Patterson Performance
series. </p>

<p>Memory tests. The first digit span test was always given
before marihuana had been administered, since the Bellewe Scale
was given each patient during the first two or three days of the
study. The trials under 2 cc. and 5 cc. were alternated. In all,
28 subjects, 17 users and 11 non-users, took this test before and
after the ingestion of marihuana. The final score equaled the
number of digits recalled. </p>

<p>To test Object Memory, ten small articles such as a key, a
ring, a pill box, and a crayon were placed on a flat, neutral
surface and exposed for three seconds. An attempt was made to
vary some of the articles at each presentation so that six or
seven were the same and three or four were different. Twenty-six
subjects, 11 users and 15 non-users, took this test. They were so
divided that 10 of them took the test the first time without
drug, 10 with 2 cc., and 6 with 5 cc. </p>

<p>To test Visual Memory, Army designs were given each subject
three times, once prior to the administration of marihuana, once
under 2 cc., and once under 5 cc. The test was riven to a total
of 28 subiects. 16 users and 12 non-users. Because there is no
alternative form for this test, results were definitely
influenced by practice. </p>

<p>Here, therefore, more than with any other test, it became
important to arrange the order of administration. The following
indicates the dosage of marihuana at the first test. </p>

<p>(table e) </p>

<p>It is obvious that the initial examination was given slightly
more often when the subjects were not under the influence of the
drug. </p>

<p>Improvement derived from practice is therefore more of a
factor in the tests which were performed under marihuana. </p>

<h2>FINDINGS</h2>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test General Intelligence. The
results of the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test which was
administered to 60 subjects, 40 users and 20 non-users, are shown
in Table 5. As has been pointed out elsewhere, these findings
indicate that both the user and the non-user groups may be
classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>(Table 5) </p>

<p>Mental Deterioration. Studies of mental deterioration due to
toxic, organic or psychotic factors, as given in the literature,
reveal that in such cases the subtest scores on the Bellevue
Adult Intelligence Test show marked irregularity, depending upon
the functions involved in the deteriorative process. As a group,
the marihuana users tested show very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors.(4) From this we may conclude that
the marihuana users had suffered no mental deterioration as a
result of their use of the drug. The age factor does not affect
the result since the groups were well equated in this respect. </p>

<p>Army Alpha Test Total Mental Functioning. The total scores
obtained from this test at the successive testing periods are
shown in Table 6. Those recorded before the administration of the
drug give a picture like that seen in any learning curve, that
is, there is a gradual increment in test scores at each testing
interval, interspersed with plateau periods. </p>

<p>Thus, without drug the test score for the second testing
interval showed a 2 per cent gain over the initial score, the
score for the third testing interval showed a 4 per cent gain
over the initial score, and so on up to the last testing period
when there was a 13 per cent gain over the initial test score. </p>

<p>Between two and a half and three hours after ingestion of 2
cc. of the drug there appeared to be a possible very slight
falling off in mental ability. Otherwise the results paralleled
the findings obtained in the undrugged condition except that
toward the end of the day the increments were larger than those
which occurred when the subjects were undrugged. This may be due
to complications in the experimental procedure or may be an
indication of accelerated mental functioning resulting from drug
ingestion. This point is discussed more fully when the effect on
different mental functions is considered. </p>

<p>Deleterious effects were apparent an hour after the ingestion
of 5 cc. of marihuana. There was a 3 per cent drop from the
initial score at this one-hour period and this first attainment
is not surpassed until four and a half hours after drug
ingestion. From the four-and-a- half- hour period on to the end
of the testing there were gradual increments in score. </p>

<p>Different Mental Functions. A very elaborate study was made of
the scores made on the subtest (Table 7). Some irregularities
occurred even in the undrugged state, and these may be attributed
primarily to chance factors, as, for example, the difference in
difficulty of the various test forms. On the whole, the findings
were in line with those which one would expect in any situation
where constant repetition increases efficiency. </p>

<p>The effects of 2 cc. of marihuana on the different mental
functions were variable. Tests involving number concepts gave
clear-cut, consistent findings and revealed that impairment
occurred an hour after the drug was taken and continued for from
two and a half to three hours after ingestion. Results of other
tests showed that there was little if any loss in ability, and
some of them, especially those done toward the end of the day,
showed gains which exceeded the ones made in the undrugged state.
It is not possible on the basis of the present data to ascertain
whether these large increments indicate that small amounts of the
drug serve as stimulants in situations dependent primarily upon
verbal facility or whether they are due to certain complications
in the test technique. The former theory coincides with the
increased verbosity noted on other tests as well as with the
clinical impression, but the latter also cannot be overlooked. </p>

<p>Further investigation of this point is definitely indicated. </p>

<p>The effect of the 5 cc. dosage on each function was in line
with that reported for total scores, that is, there was a falling
off in efficiency one hour after the drug was taken and this
impairment continued for anywhere from three and a half to six
and a half hours after ingestion. Here too the scores on tests
involving number concepts were most severely affected, recovery
for them taking place from six to six and a half hours after drug
administration. </p>

<p>Degree and Duration of Drug Effect. In general it may be
stated that marihuana has a deleterious effect on mental
functioning, the extent, time of onset, and duration of the
impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>The adverse effect of the 2 cc. dosage on global intelligence
was slight (about 3 per cent to 4 per cent impairment in
efficiency) and of sort duration, occurring at about two and a
half hours after ingestion and lasting little longer than a
half-hour or an hour. Certain mental functions, especially those
dealing with number concepts, appear to have been affected much
earlier than others, the effect on the number test scores being
measurable as early as one hour after ingestion and continuing
until two and a half hours after ingestion. For other functions,
in particular those involving verbal facility, the results were
variable, in some instances showing no adverse effect and even a
slight acceleration. </p>

<p>The effect of 5 cc. of marihuana on global intellectual
functioning was apparent within an hour from the time the drug
was taken and was operative until four and a half hours after
ingestion. All mental functions showed this early impairment but
for some of them recovery from the adverse effect was earlier
than for others. Those most severely impaired from point of view
of duration were the ones dealing with number concepts. </p>

<p>(Table 6) </p>

<p>The testing program was continued for only seven hours after
the drug was taken and, therefore, any estimate of the effect of
marihuana after this time is purely a subjective one. However,
both the subject and the examiner felt that the drug produced a
&quot;hang- over&quot; which in most cases continued into the
following day. The subject complained of being headachy, sleepy,
and unable to work at his usual level, and the examiner also
noted that the subject did not work as well or as quickly when
called upon to do something on a day following marihuana
ingestion. </p>

<p>The impairment reported here is not entirely representative of
the maximum impairment which occurs under the influence of
marihuana. Two opposing variables account for the results
obtained in the drugged condition. One variable is practice
effect which tends to increase test scores with each succeeding
trial. The other variable, the drug, tends to lower test scores.
In the earlier sessions there was evidence that the marihuana,
especially when given in large doses, is the more potent force,
as seen by the continuing downward trend of the curve during the
first few hours. In these earlier phases, in spite of repetition,
results were lower with each succeeding trial, or if there was no
actual loss, the increments made were never comparable to those
made in the undrugged state. Three or four hours after drug
administration there was a general trend toward rising scores.
Some of this gain must be attributed to increased practice effect
which was counteracting, in part at least, the deleterious effect
of the marihuana. For this reason it is not certain that the drug
was less effective at later points in the curve than it was at
the moment of seemingly greatest impairment. This seems
particularly plausible because, beginning with the third hour,
the subject was no longer working on new tasks but was actually
repeating identical tasks that he performed earlier in the day.
Thus, at the third hour the test form used was the same as the
one given at the initial session; at the end of the
three-and-a-half-hour period the form was the same as the
one-hour examination, and so on. What is shown in the curves is
the effect of marihuana on intellectual tasks with which the
subject has become very familiar. For practical purposes the test
situation has the advantage of being comparable with daily living
since the tasks performed in daily routine are usually relatively
familiar ones. </p>

<p>(Table 7) </p>

<p>Speed Versus Power. Intellectual impairment under the
influence of marihuana resulted from a loss in both speed and
efficiency. There was a slowing up in output indicated by the
difference in the number of items done before and after the
administration of the drug. On the whole the number of test items
attempted tended to increase at each succeeding examination
period even when the subject was under the influence of
marihuana, but the percentage of increase in the drugged state
practically never equaled that attained for the corresponding
time interval when the subject had not ingested the drug. The
findings for the number of items done in the drugged and
undrugged condition follow very closely the findings in respect
to the number of items correctly done. From this it may be
concluded that under the influence of marihuana an individual
functions less rapidly and also less efficiently than when he has
had no drug. </p>

<p>Careful analysis of what causes the loss in efficiency reveals
that certain factors not necessarily related to mental ability
per se were accountable for the reduced scores in the drugged
state. For example, under the influence of the drug the subject
felt dizzy, had blurred vision, or exhibited other handicapping
physiological disturbances. These impeded his efficiency in
putting his answer on the correct line, or marking a cross in the
right box. Men were observed running their fingers across the
page in an effort to keep their place. On the other hand, much of
the intellectual loss can be ascribed to an impairment in the
thinking processes, and there seemed to be a general confusion of
ideas and inability to maintain a fixed goal. Some subjects
reported that the reason they accomplished so little was that, by
the time they had finished reading a question, they no longer
remembered what their purpose in reading it had been.
Occasionally perseveration of a form of response specific to one
test was found in a subsequent test. For example, some forms of
the Same-Opposite test require the subject to mark the answer S
or O. In a later test requiring a plus or minus response
occasional irrelevant S's or O's appeared. </p>

<p>Comparison of the Effect of Marihuana on User and Non-User. </p>

<p>When the group is divided into marihuana users and nonusers
certain interesting and suggestive differences are revealed
(Table 8). </p>

<p>Although the general findings for total intelligence scores
for the two groups follow similar curves, the deleterious effects
were not as great on the user as on the non-user. Thus under 2
cc. of marihuana the user showed no real intellectual impairment
except for a very short interval beginning about two and a half
hours after ingestion and lasting for an hour or an hour and a
half. In contrast to this he made gains both at the beginning of
the testing and toward the end of the day which exceeded those
made in the undrugged state. The non-user who had ingested 2 cc.
of marihuana showed a definite drop in score beginning about two
and a half hours after ingestion, and for a period from one and a
half to two and a half hours after this time he did not make
increments comparable to those which he made in the undrugged
state. Following this, during the last two hours of testing he,
like the user, obtained scores which showed an acceleration not
paralleled in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(Table 8) </p>

<p>Under 5 cc. of marihuana both the user and the non-user showed
a 3 per cent loss in efficiency within an hour of the time that
the drug was taken. Although recovery was slow for both groups,
the user was less severely affected, as is indicated by the fact
that at the next testing interval his score was only 1 per cent
below his initial score as compared with a 7 per cent loss on the
part of the non-user. The disparity in the degree of impairment
for the two groups continued for several hours. The more marked
drug effect in the case of the non-user was further evidenced by
the fact that the user showed recovery four or four and a half
hours after ingestion (as measured by the time when his scores
approach those made when in the undrugged state) while the
non-user, even at the end of seven hours of testing, did not
approximate his undrugged performances. </p>

<p>No simple explanation of this difference is available. The
most probable reason seems to be that previous use of the drug in
some way serves to ameliorate that anxiety and inevitable
disorganization which the use of any drug may have on an
individual who has never taken it before. Another explanation may
lie in possible physiological adaptation to the drug which,
though not identical with tolerance in the ordinary
pharmacological sense, seems to act in the same direction. </p>

<p>Variability. The results reported here are all in terms of
averages. </p>

<p>A study of individual scores indicates that there was marked
variability in the effect of the drug on different subjects. In
one case the drug action came early and soon disappeared. Another
subject experienced no reaction until after he had eaten his
lunch, at which time a very definite effect was apparent. A third
subject showed impairment late in the day when the drug effect on
almost all the other subjects had worn off. There were some hardy
souls who did not appear to be affected by even large quantities
of marihuana, while a few (mainly non-users) became so ill that
they could not continue with the examinations. </p>

<p>Pyle's Digit Symbol Test Comparison of the results obtained on
this test when the subject was in the undrugged condition and
when he had had 2 cc. of marihuana reveals that small amounts of
the drug did not interfere with his ability to carry out the
appointed task (Table 9). In fact, as was noted above for certain
other tests, the improvement in score at the end of two and a
half or three hours was greater after the ingestion of 2 cc. of
marihuana than it was when no drug had been administered, and at
the end of the five-hour testing period there was a 32 per cent
increase in score as against a 22 per cent increase in the
undrugged condition. </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana, however, there was
a decrease in ability occuring within an hour after the time the
drug was administered. Although the scores show no actual loss as
compared with the initial score, the increments did not equal
those made in the undrugged condition until from four to four and
a half hours after ingestion. </p>

<p>It may therefore be concluded that certain types of learning
ability are not affected by small amounts (2 cc.) of marihuana,
but are impaired when larger amounts (5 cc.) are ingested. </p>

<p>(Table 9) (Table 10) </p>

<p>Cancelling a Geometric Form The results of this test are shown
in Table 10. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana, there was a slight falling off in the
subject's efficiency occurring about three hours after drug
ingestion. </p>

<p>At that time he was 3 per cent less efficient than he had been
an hour previous. With S cc. of marihuana there was a slowing up
in the subject's ability to carry out the appointed task, which
was apparent two hours after drug ingestion (and possibly
earlier). At that time there was only a 4 per cent increment over
his initial score as compared with a 10 per cent increment in the
undrugged state and a 12 per cent increment when the 2 cc. dosage
had been administered. </p>

<p>He improved only slightly at the three- and four-hour testing
interval, and only at the five-hour interval did he show an
appreciable improvement. </p>

<p>Apparently, the carrying out of a simple routine task is
adversely affected to a slight degree and for a short period of
time as the result of the ingestion of 2 cc. of marihuana while
the ingestion of S cc. of the drug produces adverse effects which
are more severe and more lasting. </p>

<p>Performance Tests Seguin Form Board. For adults of average
intelligence this test is primarily one involving speed of
reaction time. The average time taken by the subjects when they
were not under the influence of marihuana was 12.8 seconds. This
was increased to 14.0 and 14.1 seconds under doses of 2 cc. and 5
cc. respectively. Thus, ingestion of marihuana in 2 cc. and 5 cc.
doses caused a 9 per cent delay in performance time. </p>

<p>Form Boards. The time scores for this test remained
practically the same whether no drug, 2 cc. or 5 cc. of marihuana
had been administered, the average scores in terms of mental age
being respectively 11.7, 11.7 and 11.9 years. The error scores
also showed little change as a result of drug ingestion, the
averages in terms of mental age being 9.7 years (no marihuana),
9.9 years (2 cc.) and 10.2 years (5 cc.), and what change
occurred was in a positive direction, that is, there was a very
slight improvement in the subject's performance when he was under
the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design. This test correlates more highly with
abstract intelligence than do any of the other performance tests.
Here the drug had a definitely deleterious effect when it was
administered in large amounts. The average score was 17.6 when
the subjects were not under the influence of marihuana and 14.8
after they had ingested the drug; that is, under S cc. of
marihuana there was a 16 per cent loss in score as compared with
undrugged results. </p>

<p>In general it appears that those functions most closely as
sociated with higher intellectual processes are more impaired by
the drug than are the simpler functions.<br>
Memory Tests Rote Memory. As measured by the ability to repeat
digits forward there were no changes in rote memory as a result
of drug ingestion, the average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana being in each case 7.1. </p>

<p>Digits Reversed. Although the giving of digits in reverse
order is always grouped with memory testss this task actually
requires something over and above mere recall. It demands a
mental control not necessary in tests dependent purely upon rote
memory. Although simple rote memory, as measured by the ability
to repeat digits forward, was not affected by the ingestion of
marihuana, the repetition of digits reversed was affected
adversely. In the undrugged state the average for the group was
5.4, with 2 cc. the average was 5.0, and with S cc. it was 4.8.
The impairment was comparatively small but it seems to have been
related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Object Memory. The average scores under no drug, 2 cc. of
marihuana, and 5 cc. of marihuana were respectively 6.2, 5.6, and
5.9- that is, there was a loss of about 9 per cent in the
subject's ability to recall objects which had been exposed to his
vision for three seconds when he took the test under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana, while after the ingestion of 5
cc. the impairment was less, being only about 5 per cent. This
seemingly contradictory result is probably due to the fact that
by the time the subjects took the test under the influence of 5
cc. most of them had already had it two times previously. The
loss in terms of absolute number of remembered articles was
slight. </p>

<p>Visual Memory. In this test as in the case of digits reversed
something over and above simple memory function is involved. A
capacity for analysis and synthesis which correlates well with
intelligence is required for the successful execution of this
task, and it is this function which is adversely affected by the
ingestion of marihuana. The average scores were 10.3 (no drug),
9.7 (2 cc.) and 7.8 (5 cc.); that is, after the ingestion of 2
cc. of marihuana there was a 6 per cent drop in score, while
under 5 cc. there was a 24 per cent drop. </p>

<p>In general one may conclude that simple memory functions are
not affected by the administration of marihuana while the more
complex memory functions are affected adversely, the extent of
the impairment being related to the amount of drug taken. </p>

<p>Throughout the examination of subjects on individual tests,
the same difference was observed in intensity of the effect upon
user and non-user as was noted in group tests.<br>
Experiments with Marihuana cigarettes In addition to the tests
made to determine the effect of the ingestion of marihuana on
various intellectual functions, several experiments were tried
with marihuana cigarettes. The tests used in this part of the
study were the Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test; the Woody McCall
Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form I, which consists of thirty-five
examples requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication or
division; a cancellation test in which the subject is required to
cross out a specific number (in this instance the number 8)
wherever it appears on a sheet covered with rows of numbers; the
Kohs Block Design Test; and the test for rote, object, and visual
memory. </p>

<p>The subjects took the test series and individual tests twice,
once without the drug and once after having smoked marihuana
cigarettes. They were not given a specific number of cigarettes
but were told to smoke until they felt &quot;high.&quot; The
number of cigarettes smoked to produce this effect ranged from
two to seven. </p>

<p>The Mixed Fundamentals and cancellation tests were given as
group tests and were repeated at half-hour intervals for two and
a half hours. In the series given when the subjects were
&quot;high,&quot; the first test was taken as soon as the
cigarettes had been smoked. Time limit on each test was one and a
half minutes. </p>

<p>The Bellevue Adult, Kohs, and memory tests were given as
individual tests and were administered only twice, once before
the subject had smoked marihuana cigarettes and once after he had
become &quot;high&quot; from smoking them. If during the course
of the examination he wanted another cigarette or the examiner
had reason to suspect that he was no longer under the influence
of the drug, more cigarettes were smoked. The number of
cigarettes used during a three-hour testing period ranged from
six to twelve. </p>

<p>In the cancellation, Kohs, and memory tests the subjects were
so divided that half took the tests for the first time before
they had smoked and half after they had smoked. In the Woody
McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test more non-users had their first
tests before they had smoked. The Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test was always given first without the drug during the two or
three days immediately following the subject's admission. Four
weeks later the test was repeated on 10 subjects while they were
under the influence of marihuana cigarettes. </p>

<p>Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test Ten subjects, 5 users and 5
non-users, repeated this test under the influence of marihuana.
The results are shown in Table 11. </p>

<p>(TABLE 11) </p>

<p>Since the test taken when the subject was &quot;high&quot; was
always his second experience with it, some allowance must be made
for practice effect. Without drug the average I.Q. of these
subjects was 101.6, while after they had smoked cigarettes it was
104.4. This increase of only 2.8 points is smaller than one would
probably get with repetition occurring after such a short time
interval. It may be concluded, therefore, that smoking marihuana
cigarettes has some negative effect on intellectual functioning,
in that the subject benefits less from previous experiences than
he would if he had not smoked. <br>
Woody McCall Mixed Fundamentals Test, Form 1 This test was given
to 24 subjects, 10 users and 14 non-users. </p>

<p>&gt;From the results which are shown in Table 12 it may be
concluded that when the subject was &quot;high&quot; after
smoking marihuana cigarettes there was a slowing up in his
ability to do simple arithmetic calculations. This lag occurred
within the first half-hour after smoking and continued for at
least an hour. The deleterious effect was not such as to cause an
actual loss in ability but the increments resulting from repeated
practice were never as great in the drugged as in the undrugged
state. Thus, the initial increment was 10 per cent in the test
given before smoking and only 4 per cent in the one administered
after the subject had become &quot;high.&quot; The final
increment at the end of two and a half hours was 20 per cent
without drug, 13 per cent with drug. </p>

<p>This test measures the subject's ability to use acquired
knowledge. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the capacity for
using such an acquired skill is not lost but is slowed down. The
adverse effect of smoking marihuana in cigarette form occurs
almost immediately in contrast to the delayed action of the
pills. </p>

<p>(TABLE 12) </p>

<p>Cancelling 8's Sixteen subjects, 8 users and 8 non-users, took
this test, the results of which are shown in Table 13. As a
result of smoking marihuana cigarettes the subject worked a
little slower in his execution of a routine task than he did when
he had not smoked. The increment over the initial score in the
test score made a half-hour after he became &quot;high&quot; was
only 7 per cent as against an increment of 9 per cent when the
cigarettes had not been smoked. His performance was slowed up for
one hour after smoking and possibly longer. </p>

<p>(TABLE 13) </p>

<p>Kohs Block Design Test This test, which measures performance
ability, was given to a total of 9 subjects, 6 users and 3
non-users. The average score without the drug was 18.5, and after
cigarettes had been smoked 14.7. This difference in score of 3.8
points indicates a loss in efficiency of 21 per cent. </p>

<p>Memory Tests Rote Memory. Thirteen users and 9 non-users took
this test. </p>

<p>Neither in repeating digits forward nor in giving them in
reverse did the subjects show any disadvantageous effects from
the use of marihuana cigarettes, the average scores before and
after smoking being 6.9 and 7.1 respectively for the digits
forward test and 5.2 and 5.1 for the digits reversed test. The
only explanation for this deviation from the results obtained
when marihuana was taken in pill form is the inability to control
the dosage when marihuana is given in cigarette form. </p>

<p>Object Memory. Thirteen subjects took this test. Object memory
was not impaired by the smoking of marihuana, the average scores
being 6.8 before the cigarettes were smoked and 7.1 when the
subjects were &quot;high.&quot; Visual Memory. There was an .8
point loss (from 10-5 to 9.7) in the average score of the 20
subjects, 11 users and 9 non-users, who took this test. This
represents an impairment of about 8 per cent. </p>

<p>Effect of Marihuana Cigarettes on Users and Non-Users The
difference in intensity of effect of marihuana cigarettes on the
user and on the non- user was not the same as the difference in
the effect of the marihuana concentrate on these two groups. The
user was usually more affected by smoking marihuana than was the
non- user, probably because the nonuser did not smoke as much or
as intensely as the user and was not as much under the influence
of the drug. <br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marijuana </b></p>

<h1>FINDINGS </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Rorschach Test</b> </p>

<p>Table 14 gives the Rorschach findings for 45 subjects both in
the undrugged and drugged states. The measurable changes on the
test which occurred during the period of drug intoxication were
few and not far-reaching. They may be considered indications of
tendencies rather than of significant alterations of the
personality. </p>

<p>(TABLE 14) </p>

<p>When the subjects were under the influence of marihuana
(either 3- 6 cc. or cigarettes, the number of cigarettes being at
the discretion of the smoker) there was a slightly freer flow of
associations than there was when they were in the undrugged
state, an increased productivity which coincided with the
impressions obtained from general observation of the subjects
when they were &quot;high.&quot; Without drug the average number
of interpretations made was 20.0, with drug 23.3. This increased
number of responses was due primarily to the subject's greater
awareness of small, extraneous details which in his undrugged
state he overlooked. Thus, while 17 per cent of the subjects'
answers were small or rare detail responses when no marihuana had
been administered, with marihuana this increased to 21 per cent.
Coincidental with his increased absorption in the irrelevant
there was a slight decrease in the subject's drive to organize
and synthesize. Whereas without drug 40 per cent of the responses
involved the entire blot, with drug this was true of only 36 per
cent of the interpretations. Under the influence of marihuana
there was a mild tendency for the subject to become preoccupied
with minutiae rather than to concern himself with the larger,
more important aspects of a situation, and this implies some
falling off in meaningful constructive behavior. </p>

<p>When the subject had taken marihuana there was some decrease
in the objectivity with which he sized up situations. This was
indicated by the fact that without drug 92 per cent of his
interpretations were good form, that is, they corresponded to the
form of the blot, while with drug this percentage fell to 86 per
cent. The drug had an adverse effect on the individual's critical
faculty and he was more prone to jump to erroneous conclusions
than he was when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The only other change that occurred on the Rorschach test
after the ingestion of marihuana was the decrease in the
subject's ability to think in line with the group. This showed
itself in the decreased number of popular interpretations made,
the drop being from 27 per cent without drug to 20 per cent with
drug. In other words, during the period of drug intoxication an
individual is somewhat less likely to see the obvious and the
commonplace than he is in his normal state. </p>

<p>As important, or possibly even more important, than the
changes which occurred on the Rorschach after ingestion or
smoking of marihuana, is the fact that some of the most basic
personality attributes remained unchanged. Thus it appeared that
33 per cent of the subjects in the undrugged state were what is
described as introversive, that is, they were individuals who
tend to withdraw somewhat from the world about them and depend
primarily on their own inner resources for emotional stimulation;
20 per cent were extraversive, depending mainly on their
environment for affective satisfaction; 20 per cent were
ambivert, showing equal potentialities in both directions; and 27
per cent were emotionally constricted to the point where they
gave little or no evidence of emotional response of any type.
With drug 36 per cent were introversive, 22 per cent were
extraversive, 20 per cent were ambivert, and 22 per cent were
constricted. Marihuana ingestion or smoking served to dilate the
emotional life of only 2 of the subjects and shifted the type of
1. In all 3 cases the change was actually a very slight one. The
fact that the emotional trends remain essentially unchanged under
the influence of marihuana was further revealed by the fact that
the ratio for evaluating the individual's emo tional type, that
is, the ratio of movement to color, remained roughly the same
before and after he had taken the drug, being 2.3:1.6 when he was
in the undrugged state and 2.9:2.1 when he was in the drugged
phase. </p>

<p>Although the quantitative changes occurring with marihuana
ingestion or smoking were not large, there was a qualitative
difference in the protocols obtained from the subjects in the
undrugged and drugged stages. Not only was there a slight
increase in the actual number of interpretations made, but the
amount of talking and extraneous comment increased. The subject
played around with answers and often repeated them. He seemed
anxious to get his every thought clearly across to his audience.
More than this, he was much freer in the type of interpretation
he allowed himself. </p>

<p>For example, one interpretation on Card II read: &quot;Two
dogs. Now wait a minute. I don't want to jump to conclusions but
it looks as if the dogs were having intercourse and there was a
rupture.&quot; This response was not repeated when the subject
was retested in the undrugged state. Nor was this individual
unique in showing this qualitative difference. The disinhibition
and lessening of restraint which was a definitely observable
effect of the drug was also reflected in the assured explanations
and lengthy tirades which the subject offered on topics which in
his undrugged state he would undoubtedly feel were beyond him.
Thus one subject interpreted Card X as &quot;old bark of trees,
roots dried up. It's thousands of years old; it takes thousands
of years to do that. I got to tell you that. I got to cover for
you. You wouldn't know about a thousand years ago. I'm smart
now.&quot; In some instances the &quot;cockiness&quot; induced by
his drugged condition produced an entirely new attitude in the
subject. Instead of the customary deferential, almost
ingratiating approach there was now a confident
&quot;know-it-all&quot; manner. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana ingestion on user and non-user were
essentially the same, as indicated by the findings in Table 14,
except that on the whole the alterations which did occur were
more marked for the non-user than for the user. Thus, for
example, while the average number of responses given by the user
increased only 11 per cent, those of the non-user rose 26 per
cent. Again, the user when drugged gave only 6 per cent fewer
whole answers as against a decrease of 15 per cent in the whole
responses of the non-user in the drugged state. The user showed a
29 per cent increase in small detail interpretations, the
non-user 31 per cent. There was only a 2 per cent drop in good
form interpretation by the user as against a 12 per cent drop for
the non-user. Only in the loss of popular interpretations did the
user exceed the non-user, his falling off being as great as 31
per cent as compared with 24 per cent for the non-user. While the
number of subjects in both groups was too small to allow of
definite statements, the trend seemed to indicate that the
ingestion or smoking of marihuana has a greater adverse or
disorganizing effect on the neophyte than on the experienced
smoker, again, as was the case in the study of mental
functioning, suggesting the possibility of psychological
habituation. </p>

<p>When the protocols obtained from these marihuana users in
their undrugged state are compared with those of the nonusers or
with the norms postulated for average adults of this age level,
certain deviating personality traits in these users may be noted.
The most striking deviation is the small percentage of users who
showed an extraversive personality. Only 15 per cent of the
marihuana users used in this study responded primarily to
emotional stimuli in the world about them as compared with 28 per
cent of the non-users. </p>

<p>While no definite figures are given in the literature for the
degree of extraversion in the general population, it seems
definitely more than 15 per cent. Altogether the personality
types among the non-users show a much more even distribution than
those among the users as seen in Table 15. Judging by the
personality types the majority of marihuana users lack social
ease and adroitness and are likely to find it difficult to make
good outgoing social contacts. </p>

<p>(TABLE 15) </p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent of the marihuana users' interpretations
were determined by the form or outline of the blot. Such
responses require an objective critical attitude unmodified by
emotional factors. However, when this attitude is maintained to
the point where more than 50 per cent of the answers are of this
nature the individual has a constricted affective life the degree
of constriction being in proportion to the increase in form
interpretations Thus, as was previously noted, there was more
than average emotional inhibition evident among the marihuana
users studied in this experiment. Since emotional inhibition
frequently causes intellectual constriction it is not surprising
to find that the stereotypy in these records was slightly above
expectancy, as indicated by the fact that 59 per cent of the
responses were animal or animal detail interpretations as
compared with a norm of from 25 to 50 per cent. </p>

<p>Finally the marihuana users (as well as the non-users in this
experiment) showed a depressive outlook in that more of their
responses were determined by the gray and black colors than by
the vivid colors. In interpreting this fact it must be borne in
mind that the subjects were all prisoners and their depressive
attitude may have been a reflection of their present situation
rather than of a basic trait. </p>

<p><b>Goodenough Test (Drawing of a Man)</b> </p>

<p>This test is helpful in studying each individual both in the
drugged and undrugged state, but group results are not meaningful
(except for one finding given below) because of a lack of
similarity both in the drawings obtained in the undrugged state
and in the direction of change which occurred after drug
ingestion or smoking. However, certain qualitative findings
proved interesting and are therefore reported here. In a number
of cases the identical drawing was produced in the undrugged, 2
cc., 5 cc., and cigarette state, but the size of the figure
increased consistently with the amount of marihuana taken. This
increase in size may have been a reflection of a physical
sensation induced by the drug, rnay have been due to a tendency
to macrographia which was noted in the writing of some subjects,
or may have been the psychological representation of increased
feelings of confidence and security. </p>

<p>With marihuana there was an increase in the percentage of
subjects who remembered to give their man ears. This again may
have been due to a heightened awareness of ears because of
physical or auditory sensations or might denote a greater
receptivity to what others have to say. </p>

<p>In some cases the amount of time consumed in execution of the
drawings was considerably greater when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; This additional time was rarely used for
elaborating the picture but was caused by the subject's altered
mood. In many instances the laughter and joking in which he
indulged kept him from completing the job with dispatch. In other
cases depression or nausea slowed him up. Although aware of the
details which should be included, the subject was often satisfied
to indicate such items by a single line or dash rather than
discipline himself to the point where he could make a careful
picture. In some of these cases the drawing had attributes which
resemble the findings sometimes seen in productions of
individuals in a manic mood. </p>

<p>When a person is given a sheet of paper and is asked to draw a
man on it, the paper and the figure he draws become the situation
he must manipulate. If the figure is well centered so that the
finished product gives a balanced composition, the subject has
handled the circumstance in adequate fashion. The one consistent
finding for this test was the fact that the subject's ability to
handle situations was not improved by drug ingestion or smoking.
In the case of both user and non-user the percentage of balanced
compositions produced in the various drug states did not change
from the results obtained in the undrugged condition. It is,
however, interesting to note that 59 per cent of the marihuana
users made &quot;unbalanced&quot; drawings in the undrugged state
as compared with only 29 per cent of the non-users. It may be
inferred from this that fewer users than non-users are inclined
to come out into the center of the scene. This carries with it
implications of poor adjustment and insecurity. </p>

<p><b>Level of Aspiration Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the majority of the subjects manifested
reactions which are usual in the experience of other experiments,
namely, the tendency to place their estimate just a little above
their actual performance. This was demonstrated by the fact that
while the average performance time needed for carrying out a set
task (putting sixteen blocks in a box, red side up) was 23.6
seconds, the subjects' average estimate for accomplishing this
was 21.9 seconds. As their performance improved with practice,
the subjects tended to allow themselves less time for the job.
Such statements as, &quot;I should do better this time,&quot; or
&quot;I'll take a chance,&quot; were not infrequent. Some
subjects wanted to know the best score ever made, and worked
energetically to attain it. </p>

<p>With 2 cc. of marihuana there was a slight increase in the
average estimated time for the entire group although there was no
concomitant increase in performance time. Under this dosage the
estimated time was 23.1 seconds, performance time 23.4 seconds.
Although the subject actually took no longer to do the job he
thought he would work more slowly and in predicting his
achievement gave himself more time. His attitude during the test
was a much easier, more happy go-lucky one. He occasionally
stopped in the middle of the experiment to discuss something with
the examiner or call out to someone passing in the hall. There
thus appeared to be a small loss in drive which, though not
revealed by significant statistical differences, was indicated by
the numerical trend and by the subject's attitude toward the
test. </p>

<p>After the ingestion of 5 cc. of marihuana the average
estimated time was 23.2 seconds and the performance time 24.4
seconds. Here the relationship between estimated and performance
time was similar to that found in the undrugged phase, that is,
there was a 1.2 second gap between them. During this drug phase
the subjects seemed less relaxed than they were under 2 cc., and
their main interest seemed to be to get back to bed and be left
undisturbed. </p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana cigarettes the trend was
similar to that found with 2 cc., the difference between the
estimated time and the performance time being only 0.3 second. As
with 2 cc., subjects behavior was generally happy and relaxed. </p>

<p>When the group was divided into users and non-users the trend
was the same for both. </p>

<p>(TABLE 16) </p>

<p>On the whole it appears that small doses of marihuana and of
marihuana cigarettes tend to lower the individual level of
aspiration, that is, there is a slight lessening in the subject's
drive and his will to achieve. Larger doses (5 cc.) do not
produce this effect. </p>

<p><b>Frustration Test </b></p>

<p>The results of the frustration experiment indicated no
statistically significant differences between the subject's
reactions before and after he had taken marihuana. Again, after
the ingestion of marihuana there was a slight trend toward
lowering the level of aspiration (Table 17), but the over-all
change was not startling when compared with results on the Level
of Aspiration Test when no frustrating experience was introduced.
</p>

<p>(TABLE 17) </p>

<p><b>Binet Lines</b> </p>

<p>Binet's interpretation of this test was based upon the
principle that suggestible individuals, once embarked on a
particular form of activity (in this instance, drawing lines of
increasing length), ale more prone to continue this activity when
the stimulus is altered than are less suggestible people. Judging
by the results as given in Table 18, small doses of marihuana (2
cc. and cigarettes) induced thus type of perseverative behavior
in the users but not in the non- users. In other words, the
marihuana user when under the influence of the drug tended to
continue an activity he had started without being too
discriminatory or controlled about it. The non-user, on the other
hand, showed a curtailment in activity and responsiveness. One
possible explanation of this difference in effect on user and
non-user appears to lie in the fact that the drug made the user
more relaxed and easy-going and less controlled in motor activity
than he was in his undrugged state, while the non-user was often
more tense and disturbed. As was so often the case in the
personality tests, the effect on the user of large doses of the
drug (S cc.) was contrary to that of the small ones, probably
because in many cases he was made physically uncomfortable and
intellectually disorganized. </p>

<p>(TABLE 18) </p>

<p>The lack of consistency in the findings seems to suggest that
the individual's psychological and physiological &quot;set&quot;
toward the drug affects his reaction and behavior. Thus small
doses, which the marihuana user anticipates with pleasure make
him more easy-going and therefore probably more suggestible than
he would be in his undrugged state, while large doses have a
contrary effect. The non-user, on the other hand, appears to be
less suggestible as a result of drug ingestion than he ordinarily
is. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Vocational Interest Blank</b> </p>

<p>The average number of positions chosen by the subjects when
they were in the undrugged state was 13.2. With 2 cc. of
marihuana the average was 12.9; with 5 cc., 12.7; and with
cigarettes, 11.8. There was a very slight but not statistically
significant trend toward a decrease in job interest. However, the
absence of any appreciable change in the number of positions
liked after the ingestion or smoking of marihuana indicates that
no real withdrawal is implied. </p>

<p>Analysis of the type of position chosen shows that under the
influence of marihuana there was no swing to the more feminine
occupations, but in the case of some subjects, especially
marihuana users, there was a falling off in the popularity of
some jobs which require considerable activity. For example, under
the influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
the jobs of detective, policeman and taxi driver were found among
his least desired occupations though they were not in this place
when he was in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>The trend was the same for the user and the non-user in both
the drugged and undrugged phase. For the user the jobs of
aviator, gymnasium teacher, newspaper reporter, sailor and
soldier were most frequently chosen; for the non-user aviator,
doctor, explorer, forest ranger, newspaper reporter and prize
fighter were most popular. </p>

<p><b>Loofbourrow Personal Index: Test I</b> </p>

<p>Before taking marihuana, the user and non-user on an average
indicated familiarity with an identical number of words, 65.2.
After he had smoked marihuana cigarettes, the user's vocabulary
showed a gain of 6 words, the non-user's 5 words. In both cases
the subject's confidence in his verbal capacity was enhanced by
the use of marihuana.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Wechsler Free Association Test</b> </p>

<p>In the undrugged state the user and non-user were disturbed by
the same stimulus words, namely &quot;lonely,&quot;
&quot;passionate,&quot; &quot;insult,&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot;
The only differences were the disturbance the user showed in
response to the words &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and
the delayed reaction of the non-user to the word
&quot;pity.&quot; </p>

<p>Under the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana
cigarettes the user was less disturbed by all these words with
the possible exception of &quot;insult,&quot; but there was a
sharp increase in the agitation aroused by the words
&quot;suicide&quot; and &quot;death.&quot; It appears that the
feeling of well-being produced by the drug tended to alleviate
the loneliness, guilt, and frustration which the subject felt,
but it was also accompanied by a fear of death. This may be tied
up with the anxiety the marihuana user always experiences in
regard to the amount of drug he is taking, the always present
fear of his &quot;blowing his top,&quot; or it may be a
reflection of the problems which were most disturbing to him. </p>

<p>The non-user, after taking marihuana, was also less disturbed
by the words &quot;lonely,&quot; &quot;passionate,&quot; and
&quot;sin.&quot; His reaction to &quot;pity&quot; was also
diminished but he, too, was still upset by the word
&quot;insult.&quot; The new disturbing stimulus words were not
those which upset the user but those which were more closely
related to his own immediate problems namely &quot;honest,&quot;
&quot;money,&quot; and &quot;sex.&quot; Since the non-user in our
group was generally an individual who had been sent to prison
because of stealing or a sex offense, it seems it was these
problems which the disinhibiting action of the drug brought to
the fore.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Pressey X-O Test</b> </p>

<p>This test was taken by only 10 subjects, 5 users and 5
nonusers. In general, the smoking of marihuana brought about some
increase in the number of words which had an unpleasant meaning
to the subject and in the number of things about which he had
worried. There was some decrease in the number of things for
which the drugged subject thought a person should be blamed. The
number of his associations with any one word remained roughly the
same in the drugged and undrugged state. </p>

<p>Although less inclined to censure when under the influence of
marihuana, the subject was nevertheless more readily disturbed
and worried. This undercurrent of irritability and anxiety seemed
to be a concomitant of the more obvious feeling of general
well-being which is the predominant effect of the drug. Two
possible explanations can be given here for this finding: the
physiological changes occurring with the smoking -of the drug
gave the subject a feeling of anxiety, and the disinhibition
which occurred at this time released the restraints which had
been imposed not only on the happier reactions but on all the
repressed unpleasantness as well, and things which the subject
had repressed because he wished to forget them now came to the
fore. This was noted when at least two of the subjects had
&quot;crying jags&quot; when drugged, reproaching themselves for
what they had done to their mothers and wives.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Downey Will-Temperament Test: Test I</b> </p>

<p>The changes in the subjects' responses on this test showed a
shift in their attitude toward themselves as a result of
marihuana ingestion. On the whole, more subjects appeared to
think better of themselves when they were &quot;high&quot; than
they did in their undrugged state. This is indicated by the fact
that there was an increase in the number of individuals who under
the influence of 5 cc. of marihuana or of marihuana cigarettes
believed themselves to be careful, cautious, ambitious, accurate,
industrious, impulsive, enthusiastic, and possessing superior
characters. There was also a decrease in the number who
considered themselves suggestible or extravagant. The only
negative traits which the subject admitted to more frequently
when he was &quot;high&quot; than he did in his normal state were
suggestibility, poor memory and aggression. The change in
attitude in regard to aggression was most striking among the
marihuana users, 88 per cent of whom considered themselves
aggressive after they had had the drug as compared with only 42
per cent in the undrugged state. This increase in the feeling of
aggression was not paralleled by the findings of the other tests
nor by the behavior of the subjects when they had taken the drug.
Like the increased vocabulary noted on the Loofbourrow it can
best be interpreted as an indication of the subject's increased
feelings of confidence and self-assurance. </p>

<p>(Table 19)<br>
</p>

<p>In general the changes which occurred on this test after the
subject had had marihuana were not consistent for the user and
the non-user or for different amounts of the drug. They merely
served to indicate that when the subject was under the influence
of marihuana there were shifts in his feelings about himself
which reflected a prevailing mood of confidence and self-
satisfaction. </p>

<p>Thematic Apperception Test </p>

<p>Without cigarettes the needs most frequently expressed in the
subjects' stories were &quot;affiliation,&quot;
&quot;aggression,&quot; &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;dominance,&quot;
&quot;succorance,&quot; &quot;self-abasement,&quot; and
&quot;play.&quot; These terms may be defined as follows:(1)
Affiliation: to be sociable, to make friends, to love.
Aggression: to fight, to criticize, to blame, to accuse or
ridicule maliciously, to injure or kill, sadism. Sex: to seek sex
objects, to court, to enjoy intercourse. Dominance: to influence
or control others, leadership. Succorance: to seek aid,
protection or sympathy. Selfabasement: to comply, to surrender,
to accept punishment, to apologize, to condone, to atone, to
depreciate ego, masochism. Play: to relax tension and alleviate
stress by pleasurable and humorously irresponsible activity,
motor, verbal or mental. </p>

<p>In general the frequency with which all needs were expressed
fell off after the subjects had smoked marihuana cigarettes. The
most striking drops were in the need for self-abasement and
aggression where the frequency of occurrence changed from 2.4 to
1.1 for the former, and from 2.7 to 1.7 for the latter. Contrary
to the general trend there was an increase in the need for
dominance. </p>

<p>When the subjects were not &quot;high&quot; the environmental
influences most frequently mentioned in their stories were
illness and death and accepting parents. After smoking marihuana
the general trend was similar to that noted for the
&quot;needs,&quot; that is there was a falling off in the
frequency with which the subjects used most of the concepts. </p>

<p>There was, however, no diminution in the number of times that
illness and death played a part in their tales, the average
number being 2.1 before smoking and 2.2 after smoking. Likewise
the awareness of restraint and imprisonment remained constant,
occurring 1.1 times before smoking and 1.2 after. Contrary to the
general trend there was an increased awareness of an accepting
love object. This concept appeared in the stories on an average
of .8 time before smoking and 1.2 after. </p>

<p>The decrease in the number of times both needs and
environmental pressures were expressed in the stories given after
the subjects had had cigarettes was not due to a curtailment in
the length of the story. The tales were often more wordy in the
drugged than in the undrugged state, but their length was
frequently due to embellishment and repetition, and there was
likely to be less meaningful material. In general the stories
obtained from the subjects after smoking indicated that they had
less capacity for expressing themselves directly and clearly, and
also less concern with self-abasement and aggression. As defined
on this test these needs represent a conflict between aggression
against the self and against others and appear to stem from
insecurity and feelings of guilt and inadequacy. In the drugged
state the subjects appeared less disturbed by this conflict and
had less need to harry themselves and others. They had a greater
need for dominance, a desire for leadership. This ties in with
the greater self-assurance demonstrated by other tests and with
the increased awareness of acceptance by a love object found on
this test. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that these subjects showed no
falling off in their awareness of illness and death or of
restraint and imprisonment after smoking. The frequency of the
latter concept was undoubtedly related to their status as
prisoners, while the former ties in with the findings on the Free
Association Test where the word &quot;death&quot; remained a
disturbing factor even after marihuana had been smoked or
ingested. </p>

<p><b>FINDINGS ON WOMEN SUBJECTS</b> </p>

<p>As in the case with the men, when the female subject was under
the influence of marihuana her basic personality structure did
not change and only some relatively superficial emotional
reactions were different. As a group, the women used in this
study showed a somewhat constricted personality, and this
constriction was not lessened when the subject was
&quot;high.&quot; The emotional reactions revealed in the
Rorschach Test showed that the subjects in this particular group
were primarily extraversive, and this remained unchanged after
the administration of marihuana. Again, like the men, when under
the influence of the drug the women lowered the achievement
levels they set for themselves. However, they did not show any
increased self-confidence as did the men, either by an increase
in the number of words they claimed to know in the Loofbourrow
Test or in their appraisal of themselves as indicated in the
Downey Will-Temperament Test. In general, the women exhibited a
loss of drive for participation in anything requiring effort.
This is inferred from their performance in the Level of
Aspiration Test, the Vocational Interest Blank, and the Binet
Lines Test, as well as from their behavior. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>BEHAVIOR DURING THE TEST PERIOD OF SUBJECTS UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF MARIHUANA</b> </p>

<p>The findings reported here have all been in terms of
objective, quantitative measures. Some effects of the drug,
observable during examinations, cannot be quantified but are
nevertheless important to the understanding of the drug action.
These effects were reflected in those reactions of the subjects
which were not directly related to the test situation Behavior
was somewhat different when the subject had ingested marihuana
concentrate than it was when he had taken the drug in cigarette
form. With pills gastrointestinal disturbances were more
pronounced and drowsiness and fatigue seemed greater and more
enduring. Some individuals were so overcome by fatigue that they
worked for a few seconds only, and then sat with their heads on
the table. If spoken to, they made a great effort to do the work
but rarely continued for very long. When summoned to take the
test, especially toward the end of the day when they were almost
invariably lying on their beds, the subjects were overcome with
fatigue and were aroused only with the greatest difficulty. In
some instances there was definite resentment of this disturbance
and the impression was that only the presence of the police
officer and all the implications in the prison set-up prevented a
definite refusal to continue cooperatively. With both pills and
cigarettes many of the men had difficulty in concentrating and
maintaining a fixed goal. Subjects often stared vacantly for long
periods and when addressed came back to the test with a start.
Many burst into uncontrollable laughter over a test which in
their undrugged state had evoked no merriment. The laughter
frequently affected the entire group and most markedly those who
had been given marihuana. </p>

<p>The behavior of the user and non-user with marihuana
cigarettes was somewhat different. The user was pleasantly
excited at the thought of smoking, selected his cigarettes with
the manner of a connoisseur, and criticized or praised the
product offered him. His smoking took on something of a
ritualistic ceremony and was done in a careful and prearranged
fashion which varied slightly from individual to individual. In
general the men first opened the end of the cigarette to examine
the marihuana, then wet the &quot;stick&quot; by inserting it in
their mouths to prevent the paper from burning too rapidly. When
the cigarette was ignited the men took several short puffs, at
the same time inhaling as much air as possible. This caused the
tip of the &quot;stick&quot; to glow and resulted in a succession
of low gasping sounds from the subject The smoke was retained as
long as possible, occasionally causing severe paroxysms of
coughing. Although eager to be &quot;high&quot; the user was
consistent in his fear of &quot;blowing his top,&quot; and there
was always a point beyond which no amount of talking or cajoling
could make them continue smoking. </p>

<p>As a rule, the user liked to smoke in company. He was
generally satisfied if one friend, a &quot;kick partner,&quot;
could be with him. To this friend he would explain his thoughts
and feelings which to the objective observer were very
superficial. In trying to make a point, and usually a minor one
at that, the user, when smoking, would talk on endlessly and soon
lose his goal. He cracked many &quot;jokes&quot; which were
uproariously funny to him. In some instances &quot;leaping&quot;
or involuntary jerking of the arms, head, shoulders or legs
occurred The subject described his sensations as floating,
leaping, rocking or most often as being &quot;in the
groove.&quot; He was obviously enjoying pleasant physical
sensations and wanted to be left to himself to lie on his bed,
listen to soft music and dream or carry on &quot;deep&quot;
conversations. The test questions were frequently called a
&quot;bring down&quot; in that they forced the subject to face
reality and abandon his pleasurable feelings. Several subjects
concurred in describing part of their drug experience as
comparable to the twilight state between sleeping and waking in
which the individual floats pleasantly and does not allow outside
stimuli to impinge. Just as strong extraneous sensations will
bring the sleeper face to face with reality, so the insistence of
the examiner that the subject perform certain tasks served to
destroy his general feeling of well-being. Aside from the test
situation any unpleasant circumstances can serve as a &quot;bring
down.&quot; This &quot;bring down&quot; apparently only results
in destroying the subject's pleasure but cannot do away with the
disadvantageous effect on intellectual functioning. </p>

<p>When testing was completed the subject generally lay on his
bed and dozed or listened to the radio. His drowsiness persisted
for many hours. </p>

<p>Most non-users approached the smoking with apprehension. They
were instructed by the users in the art of lighting and inhaling,
but they rarely cooperated to the fullest extent? though this was
undoubtedly unconscious on their part. </p>

<p>The effects of marihuana on the non-users were variable. A few
of them enjoyed the results so much that they claimed they would
continue to smoke whenever they had a chance. They described such
sensations as &quot;lying in fur,&quot; and &quot;floating in
space.&quot; Some became acutely nauseous and could not continue
with their work, while others experienced little or no change in
feeling, undoubtedly because they never smoked correctly. </p>

<p>When the subjects were &quot;high,&quot; particularly in the
case of the non- user, there was a general loss of inhibition and
lessening of many social restraints which had previously been
exercised. Thus, all the men talked much more freely, confronted
each other more directly, and manifested a state of well-being at
times amounting to euphoria. They were much more confiding?
talked spontaneously about love and sexual affairs, and in two
instances exposed themselves and masturbated. </p>

<p>Although there was an undeniable increase in overt sex
interest following the ingestion of marihuana, it seems probable
that this interest was not the result of direct sexual
stimulation but rather a manifestation of a falling off in
inhibiting factors. This sex interest seems to have been due
primarily to the fact that these men had been imprisoned for
varying periods and had not had access to women. It is not at all
certain that under free conditions or with different subjects
this behavior would have been manifested. In any case, the
behavior of these prisoners was more like that which any man
deprived of sexual activity for a long period of time would
display under a releasing stimulus and not at all like the
behavior shown at marihuana &quot;tea-pads.&quot;<br>

<p><b>The LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION</h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the influence of marihuana changes in personality as
shown by alterations in test performance are slight. They are not
statistically significant and indicate only tendencies or trends.
Moreover, the drug effect is not always in proportion to the
amount taken, nor are the changes consistently in one direction.
In many instances the effect of small doses (2 cc.) or of
marihuana cigarettes is the opposite of the effect of larger
doses (5 cc.) (2) </p>

<p>(2) While sufficient experimentation has not been made to
validate the finding, it should be noted that the personality
changes produced by 2 cc. or marihuana cigarettes are almost
always in agreement in contrast to the changes resulting from the
ingestion of 5 cc. The 2 cc. Dosage apparently more nearly
approximates the amount a person would take if left to his own
devices. </p>

<p>The personality changes observed when the subject is under the
influence of 2 cc. of marihuana or marihuana cigarettes
demonstrate that the subject experiences some reduction in drive,
less objectivity in evaluating situations, less aggression, more
self-confidence and a generally more favorable attitude toward
himself. These reactions can be ascribed to two main causes,
namely, an increased feeling of relaxation and disinhibition and
increased self-confidence. As the drug relaxes the subject, the
restraints which he normally imposes on himself are loosened and
he talks more freely than he does in his undrugged state. Things
which under ordinary circumstances he would not speak about are
now given expression. Metaphysical problems which in the
undrugged state he would be unwilling to discuss, sexual ideas he
would ordinarily hesitate to mention, jokes without point, are
all part of the oral stream released by the marihuana. </p>

<p>At the same time that he verbalizes more freely, there is a
reduction in the individual's critical faculty. This is probably
due both to the intellectual confusion produced by the drug and
to the less exacting attitude his feeling of relaxation induces.
He holds himself less rigidly to the standards of his undrugged
phase and does not drive himself to achieve. He is satisfied with
himself and willing to accept himself as he is. This
self-satisfaction undoubtedly helps produce the feeling of
self-confidence which allows the subject to come out more freely
in fields which he formerly avoided. This increased confidence
expresses itself primarily through oral rather than physical
channels. Physically the subject reports pleasant sensations of
&quot;drifting&quot; and &quot;floating&quot; and he allows
himself to become enveloped in a pleasant lassitude. </p>

<p>After the administration of larger doses of marihuana (5 cc.)
the pleasurable sensations appear to be outweighed by concomitant
feelings of anxiety'and, in some cases, of physical distress,
such as nausea. Under these circumstances, for many subjects
there is little increase in confidence but rather heightened
insecurity which precludes outgoing reactions and tends to evoke
generally negativistic attitudes to most stimuli. </p>

<p>It is important to note that neither the ingestion of
marihuana nor the smoking of marihuana cigarettes affects the
basic outlook of the individual except in a very few instances
and to a very slight degree. In general the subjects who are
withdrawn and introversive stay that way, those who are outgoing
remain so, and so on. Where changes occur the shift is so slight
as to be negligible. In other words reactions which are natively
alien to the individual cannot be induced by the ingestion or
smoking of the drug. </p>

<p>Although in most instances the effects of the drug are the
same for the user and the non-user, there are some differences
both in kind and extent. Where the effects for the two groups are
in the same direction they generally are more marked in the case
of the non-user. This is not unexpected in view of the non-user's
lack of habituation to the drug action. For the nonuser his
present experience is a strange, even hazardous one, and the
uncertainty and anxiety attendant upon this impairs the sense of
well-being which the drug produces in the user. Thus the non-user
frequently feels-less secure when he is &quot;high&quot; than he
does normally and is less well adjusted than he is in ordinary
circumstances. </p>

<p>When the productions of the undrugged marihuana user are
studied, certain personality traits which serve to differentiate
him from the non-user and from the &quot;average&quot; individual
can be discerned. As a group the marihuana users studied here
were either inhibited emotionally or turned in on themselves,
making little response to stimuli in the world about them. People
with this type of personality generally have difficulty adjusting
to others and are not at ease in social situations. This
withdrawal from social contacts apparently finds little
compensatory or sublimating activity elsewhere. These subjects
did not have a desire or urge to occupy themselves creatively in
a manner which might prove socially useful. They showed a
tendency to drift along in passive fashion and gave a good
portion of their attention to relatively unimportant matters.
These men were poorly adjusted, lonely and insecure. As indicated
by their history they seldom achieved good heterosexual
adjustment. </p>

<p>CONCLUSIONS </p>

<ol>
    <li>Under the influence of marihuana the basic personality
        structure of the individual does not change but some of
        the more superficial aspects of his behavior show
        alteration. </li>
    <li>With the use of marihuana the individual experiences
        increased feelings of relaxation, disinhibition and
        self-confidence. </li>
    <li>The new feeling of self-confidence induced by the drug
        expresses itself primarily through oral rather than
        through physical activity. There is some indication of a
        diminution in physical activity. </li>
    <li>The disinhibition which results from the use of marihuana
        releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
        emotions but does not evoke responses which would be
        totally alien to him in his undrugged state. </li>
    <li>Marihuana not only releases pleasant reactions but also
        feelings of anxiety. </li>
    <li>Individuals with a limited capacity for effective
        experience and who have difficulty in making social
        contacts are more likely to resort to marihuana than
        those more capable of outgoing responses. </li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><b>Family and Community Ideologies</b> </p>

<p>Adolph G. Woltrnann, MA </p>

<p>At the outset of the study it seemed worth while to supplement
the quantitative data by some qualitative procedures of the
projective type which might throw light on the social reactions
of the individuals who were being studied. One of the methods
that has shown its possibilities, particularly in its use with
children, is the play technique in which the individual is
permitted to give free expression to some of his unconscious
motivations in a way that is not immediately apparent to him. The
limitation of this technique is the fact that it is highly
interpretive, but it has the advantage of permitting observations
of the subject's personality reactions in problem situations. </p>

<p>Such a study was accordingly carried out on 18 subjects in the
early part of the investigation. </p>

<p>METHOD </p>

<p>Two situations were studied: one, subsequently to be referred
to as the family set-up, in which toys were used to build an
apartment or home, and another, subsequently to be known as the
community set- up, in which a second variety of toys were used to
construct a town setting. </p>

<p>The Family Set-up </p>

<p>The equipment used in this part of the study consisted of a
box of household toys of the type available in the ten-cent
store, including beds, dressers, chairs, tables, sinks, a stove,
a bathtub, a wash basin, a piano, lamps, flower boxes, a
telephone, doll sets of a man, woman, boy, girl, and maid, and,
in addition, several small wooden slats which were intended to be
used as room partitions. </p>

<p>The box of toys and materials was presented to the subject
with the following directions: &quot;Here are a number of toys
which can be placed in such a manner that a house can be built
from them. You are supposed to be this doll (man). Go ahead and
build yourself a house or apartment. You may use as few or as
many toys as you wish. You may also make believe you are a
bachelor or a married man with or without a family.&quot; </p>

<p>The Community Set-up </p>

<p>In studying the community set-up the following items were
employed: eighteen wooden houses, trees, cars, trucks, fire
engines, an ambulance, a radio police car, a railroad train,
airplanes, and numerous figures representing men, women, and
children from different walks of life. All these toys were handed
to the subject at the same time with the instruction to build a
town or city. As in the family set-up, no further help or
suggestions were given. </p>

<p>The actual method of handling these materials allows for two
approaches. In the free method the subject is encouraged to play
with any toy and to create and act out any situation that the
nature of the toy suggests to him. No help, clues, or hints are
given. In the controlled methods either the subject is told to
create a specific pattern or his responses and reactions to a
predetermined particular situation are elicited. Both methods
were used in this study. </p>

<p>After the subject had completed either his family or his
community set-up and answered questions regarding certain
situations about which the examiner had questioned him the
following points were investigated: ( 1 ) subject's marital
status, both real and assumed; (2) type of home he built for
himself (number of rooms, type of furnishing); (3) subject's
assumed occupation; (4) monthly income and rent which he posited;
(S) his reaction to attempted burglary; (6) his reaction to his
wife's and his own infidelity; and (7) the attitude he would take
toward civic problems if given a position of responsibility such
as mayor. In addition, the examiner appraised the subject's
neatness and orderliness in his home and community setup. The
experiment was given first when the subject was undrugged and
then when he was under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p><b>FINDINGS</b> </p>

<p>Results were collated in terms of the type and frequency of
responses to different situations both before and after taking
marihuana and in terms of number of items (toys) employed in the
set- up, as, for example, in the case of the home situation, the
number of rooms the subject thought necessary for his apartment
and the amount of rent he thought he ought to pay and its
relation to the income he posited for himself; in the case of the
community set- up, the number of times the subject provided for
ambulances, firemen, and policemen; in the case of the subject's
reaction to burglary, whether he took a passive or a resistant
attitude toward the burglary and whether he assumed the burglar
had absconded with most of the property and so on; in the case of
his attitude toward his wife's adultery, whether he thought he
ought to divorce her or try for reconciliation; and, when the
subject was unfaithful, whether he thought his wife ought to
forgive his delinquency. </p>

<p>In most cases comparisons between responses or reactions
showed little difference in attitude before and after the
ingestion of marihuana and therefore it would not be too
profitable in this short summary of the work to present all the
data obtained. However, by way of illustrating the type of
material procured, the following tables are given: </p>

<p>(TABLE 20) </p>

<p>(TABLE 21) </p>

<p>The majority of the patients, though unmarried in real life,
assumed families and responsibilities in the play situation, and
in a free situation acted out family activities and ideologies.
These figures reveal that, on the average, the subjects when
under the influence of the drug tended to build apartments with
somewhat fewer rooms. The impression of the examiner was that
this was due primarily to the subject's desire to get through
with the task as quickly as possible in order to return to his
room to rest and sleep. </p>

<p>(TABLE 22) </p>

<p>A &quot;make-believe&quot; sickness or accident necessitating
the use of an ambulance was the most frequently observed play
pattern. When the subjects were under the influence of the drug
the incidence of the ambulance and the police was considerably
less than it was when they were in the undrugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 23) </p>

<p>The most frequent form of passive reaction to his wife's
infidelity was that the subject would pack up and leave home. The
aggressive reactions consisted of ordering the wife out of the
home in three instances, jailing the wife and lover in one
instance, throwing the wife out in one instance, killing the
lover but leaving the wife unmolested in one instance, and
beating up the lover and leaving the wife unharmed in one
instance. </p>

<p>The following are examples of subjects' responses to the
adultery situation. When he was facing the pretended situation
before taking marihuana, one subject immediately left his house,
borrowed money from his employer, and traveled to the West Coast.
After he arrived there he proceeded to drink and in due time
became a derelict on the Barbary Coast. When asked about his
children he said, &quot;That's closed with the rest of the
chapter. Let her ardent lover support the children. I take on an
assumed name. Others might get a divorce and custody of the
children but in my case my home life would be a closed
chapter.&quot; After the administration of marihuana he still
showed a passive attitude, but, having assumed the role of a
psychologist, he felt obliged to act accordingly. At first he
considered divorce action, but since that would deprive the
children of a home, he finally forgave his wife. Then he stopped
in his contemplations, looked at the examiner and said, &quot;Why
do I become altruistic? . . . That's beyond me . . . Maybe I
become a martyr . . . I commit an act of martyrdom.&quot; Another
subject, when in the undrugged condition, ordered his wife out of
the house and later divorced her. In the drugged state customary
procedures were reversed. The subject went to his parents and
remained passively at home while his mother unsuccessfully tried
to bring about a reconciliation. </p>

<p>The subject's attitude toward adultery did not change in the
drugged state. The data in Table 24 illustrate the fact that
ingestion of marihuana generally does not alter the subject's
basic attitude. </p>

<p>(TABLE 24) </p>

<p>Practically all the subjects approved of saloons. Gambling was
rejected because it deprives wives and children of money and
leads to trouble. A heavy loser may try to recoup his losses
through holdups, and fights and homicide may develop from
quarrels. Prostitution was condoned by about 5O per cent of the
subjects both before and after the ingestion of the drug, but the
use of marihuana was frowned upon more often when the subject was
undrugged than when he was in the drugged state. </p>

<p>(TABLE 25) </p>

<p><b>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Eighteen subjects who participated in the marihuana study were
subjected to the play situation with the idea of seeing whether
the pattern of play or the ideas investigated were materially
altered in consequence of the ingestion of the marihuana. Among
the ideologies which were appraised were: (1) attitude toward
family set-up; (2) attitude toward different occupations; (3)
attitude toward income; (4) attitude toward situations ordinarily
calling for aggression, namely an attempted burglary of his home
and sexual infidelity on the part of his wife; (5) attitude
toward authority. </p>

<p>In general the subject's attitude toward family and community
ideologies as manifested in play did not change markedly as a
result of the ingestion of marihuana. The subjects (in play) were
not intolerant of infidelity or aggressive toward lawbreakers
either before or after the ingestion of marihuana. On the whole
the initial passive reactions already observed in other parts of
the study were likewise observed in the play situation
experiment. The only very definite change as a result of the
ingestion of marihuana was in their attitude toward the drug
itself. Without marihuana only 4 out of 14 subjects said they
would tolerate the sale of marihuana while after ingestion 8 of
them were in favor of this. </p>

<p>Another significant manifestation in the play situation
pertains to the construction of the community set-up. In general
the community was less orderly and well organized when the
subjects had had marihuana. It is probable that this poor
organization may be ascribed to the generally indifferent
attitude and lack of motor coordination already observed in the
more controlled studies. </p>

<p>On the whole, the experiment with play technique gave less
information as to the effect of marihuana on subjects than had
been hoped for. This may have been due to the incompleteness of
the method employed or possibly to the fact that this technique
is designed to give data about the basic personality of the
individual rather than such alterations in it as might be caused
by pharmacological agents.<br>

<p><b>LaGuardia Committee Report on Marihuana</b> </p>

<h1>Comparison Between Users and Non-Users from the Standpoint of
Mental and Physical Deterioration </h1>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A careful testing of the motor and sensory functions of the
nervous system was included in the general physical examination
of each subject. Of motor functions, reflex activity and muscular
response and coordination were determined; of sensory functions,
perception of touch, pain and temperature stimuli; of specialized
functions, taste, hearing and vision. In the eye, the corneal and
light reflexes were tested and a retinal examination was made. In
this neurological examination no pathological conditions were
found in any of the subjects. </p>

<p>In the psychiatric examination attention was paid to general
intelligence and knowledge in relation to the subject's
background, to relevancy of talk in conversation, to orientation
as to time, place and situation, to memory of past and recent
events, to ability in simple arithmetic, to judgment in reaching
decisions, and to the presence of abnormal mental content shown
by delusions, hallucinations, obsessions, and ideas of
persecution. There was no evidence of disordered cerebral
functioning in any of the group. </p>

<p>As would be expected, differences in grades of intelligence
and in orderliness in thinking and reasoning were noticeable. The
Bellevue Adult Intelligence Test was administered to a total of
60 male subjects, 40 marihuana users and 20 nonusers. The average
I.Q. for the user group was 96.7, range 70 to 124, and for the
non-user group the average I.Q. was 104.5, range 93 to 114. Both
groups may therefore be classified as of average intelligence. </p>

<p>When analyzed according to racial distribution the two groups
were even better equated intellectually than the total results
indicate. For the 28 white subjects examined (13 users and 15
non-users) the average I.Q. for the users was 106.1 range 77 to
124, and for the non-users the average I.Q. was 106.3, range 96
to 114. There were 24 Negro subjects, 19 users and 5 non-users.
The average I.Q. for the users was 92.6, range 70 to 112, while
for the non-users the average I.Q. was 98.8, range 93 to 101.
Although the non-users averaged 6.2 points higher than the users,
it must be taken into account that the number of Negro non-users
tested was small. In any event, the disparity in results would
not be considered significant.. The average I.Q. of the 2 Puerto
Rican users was 91.0, range 72 to 100. </p>

<p>Reports on mental deterioration due to toxic, organic or
psychotic factors as given in the literature reveal that in such
cases the individual scores on the Bellevue Adult Intelligence
Test show marked irregularity, depending upon the functions
involved in the deteriorative process. As a group, the marihuana
users tested in this study showed very even functioning, and what
little irregularity occurred can be explained on the basis of
language and racial factors. </p>

<p>The physical and psychiatric examinations were of a
qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. In the special
examinations and tests of organ and system function, quantitative
measurements were obtained for 17 marihuana users. These subjects
were selected for the reason that they had smoked marihuana for
the longest period of time. The figures for years of usage and
number of cigarettes smoked daily were taken from each subject's
statement. </p>

<p>Marihuana users accustomed to daily smoking for a period of
from two and a half to sixteen years showed no abnormal system
functioning which would differentiate them from the non-users. </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marihuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. Addiction and Tolerance </p>

<p>A drug addiction is characterized by a compelling urge to use
the drug for the prevention or relief of distressing mental and
physical disturbances which occur when the necessary dose is
delayed or omitted. A drug habit is also characterized by an urge
to use the drug, but this is not compelling. The abstinence
symptoms, which are expressions of nervous states, are not
particularly distressing and do not occur as long as the person's
attention is placed on other matters. </p>

<p>Drug tolerance in the narrower sense used here means that
larger doses than those originally used are required to bring
about the effects desired by the subject. In the case of
morphine, tolerance develops because of addiction, but in other
instances tolerance may be present without addiction and
addiction without tolerance. When both are present the matter
takes on greater importance because of the extremes to which the
addict goes to obtain the drug constantly and in increasing
quantities. </p>

<p>As our group of subjects included 48 users of marihuana,
opportunity was afforded for some conclusions concerning
marihuana addiction and tolerance. Practically all of our group
of users stated that they could and often did voluntarily stop
the smoking for a time without any undue disturbance from the
deprivation. In the sociologic study reported by Dr. Schoenfeld
it was found that smokers had no compelling urge for marihuana.
If &quot;reefers&quot; were not readily available there was no
special effort made to obtain them from known sources of supply.
Dr. Walter Bromberg, Psychiatrist-in-Charge, Psychiatric Clinic,
Court of General Sessions in New York, states: &quot;The fact
that offenders brought up on marihuana charges do not request
medical treatment on their incarceration (with its cessation of
drug supply) argues for the absence of with drawal symptoms.''(1)
From interviews with several hundred marihuana users he concludes
that true addiction was absent. </p>

<p>(1) Bromberg, W. &quot;Marihuana: a psychiatric study.&quot;
J.A.MA. 113:4, 1939.=20 </p>

<p>The evidence submitted here warrants the conclusion that as
far as New York City is concerned true addiction to marihuana
does not occur. </p>

<p>The evidence concerning acquired tolerance is less clear-cut
Tolerance develops during the periods when the drug is being
taken and accounts for the necessity of increasing the dosage to
bring about the desired effects. How long the tolerance persists
after the drug administration is stopped has not been definitely
established in any instance. </p>

<p>The statements of marihuana usage and time since stoppage
given by eight of our subjects are summarized in Table 26. (TABLE
26) </p>

<p>On one or more of the numerous occasions on which marihuana
was administered each of these subjects received what was
considered a minimal effective dose. One (J.B.) was given 1 cc.,
another (A.B.) 3 cc., the others 2 cc. In all instances the
customary physical effects, conjunctival injection, dilated and
sluggishly reacting pupils, tremors and ataxia, were observed.
With these doses the subjects also experienced the sensation
described as &quot;high.&quot; The only conclusion warranted here
is that if acquired tolerance does occur it persists for a
limited period only. </p>

<p>Further evidence, though indirect, was brought out by Dr.
Shoenfeld's investigation and by personal interviews with our 48
users. There is agreement in the statements that among users the
smoking of one or two cigarettes is sufficient to bring on the
effect known as &quot;high.&quot; When this state is reached the
user will not continue smoking for fear of becoming &quot;too
high.&quot; When the desired effects have passed off and the
smoker has &quot;come down,&quot; smoking one cigarette brings
the &quot;high&quot; effect on again. This could not be the case
had a steadily increasing tolerance developed. </p>

<p>The evidence available then=AD-the absence of any compelling
urge to use the drug, the absence of any distressing abstinence
symptoms, the statements that no increase in dosage is required
to repeat the desired effect in users-=ADjustifies the conclusion
that neither true addiction nor tolerance is found in marihuana
users. The continuation and the frequency of usage of marihuana,
as in the case of many other habit-forming substances, depend on
the easily controlled desires for its pleasurable effects.
Possible Therapeutic Applications </p>

<p>If a drug has well-marked pharmacological actions and low
toxicity, as appears to be the case with marihuana, a
consideration of special interest is its possible therapeutic
application. In the older clinical literature marihuana was
recommended for use in a wide variety of disorders, but in recent
years it has almost disappeared from the materia medica and it
was dropped from the United States Pharmacopeia twenty years ago.
</p>

<p>In view of the laboratory and clinical findings obtained in
this study the question of the therapeutic possibilities of the
drug was considered. Marihuana possesses two qualities which
suggest that it might have useful actions in man. The first is
the typical euphoria- producing action which might be applicable
in the treatment of various types of mental depression- the
second is the rather unique property which results in the
stimulation of appetite. In the light of this evidence and in
view of the fact that there is a lack of any substantial
indication of dependence on the drug, it was reasoned that
marihuana might be useful in alleviating the withdrawal symptoms
in drug addicts. </p>

<p>At the Riker's Island Penitentiary observations were made on
56 inmates who were addicted to morphine or heroin. Two groups
were selected, the addicts in each being matched with those in
the other group as to age, physical condition, duration and
intensity of habit, and number of previous attempts at cure. The
subjects in one group received no treatment or were given
Magendie's solution according to the usual hospital regimen while
those in the other group were treated with 15 mg. of
tetrahydrocannabinol three times daily with or without placebo
(subcutaneous water injection). An attempt was made to evaluate
the severity of the withdrawal signs and symptoms. The impression
was gained that those who received tetrahydrocannabinol had less
severe withdrawal symptoms and left the hospital at the end of
the treatment period in better condition than those who received
no treatment or who were treated with Magendie's solution. The
ones in the former group maintained their appetite and in some
cases actually gained weight during the withdrawal period. </p>

<p>Since psychological factors play a large part in the
withdrawal symptoms of at least a certain proportion of morphine
addicts, there are grounds for the assumption that a drug having
the properties of marihuana might be of aid in alleviating mental
distress during the withdrawal period. However, the studies here
described were not sufficiently complete to establish the value
of such treatment, and before conclusions can be drawn the
problem must be investigated under completely controlled
conditions. PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY (1) S. Loewe, MD (2) (1) From
the Department of Pharrnacology, CorneU University Medical
College. (2) Part of the experimental work here reported was
conducted in collaboration with W. Modell SUMMARY </p>

<p>1. This review of the pharmacology of marihuana is centered
around the chemical and pharmacological identification of the
active principles of hemp. Coordination of chemical and
pharmacological investigations as a prerequisite to success in
the search for unknown principles and of the analysis of the
structure-activity relationship of these compounds is discussed. </p>

<p>2. In a survey of the sources of preparations with marihuana
activity, hemp seeds are disclosed as a heretofore unknown source
of active substances. </p>

<p>3. Varieties of hemp can be distinguished according to
genotypic differences of the content of active principles which
persist over generations independently of soil and climate. </p>

<p>4. The pharmacological actions of marihuana are analyzed with
regard to their specificity and their usefulness as indicators of
specific components. </p>

<p>5. Sixty-five substances from the new class of cannabinols and
related classes are reviewed, among which are the essential
components of the marihuana-active hemp oils. The discovery of
this class, the synthesis of these representatives, and their
structural elucidation led the way to the discovery of the active
substances. </p>

<p>6. Quantitative assay procedures are described for the most
important marihuana effects that are observed in the animal
experiment. The assay of the ataxia effect in the dog and of the
synergistic hypnotic effect in the mouse with refined procedures
are shown to be reliable expedients for measuring these two
marihuana actions, whereas the areflexia effect in rabbits failed
to show the reproducibility required for quantitative purposes. </p>

<p>7. With the aid of these methods the natural
tetrahydrocannabinols are shown to be active principles
responsible for ataxia in dogs and psychic action in man. They
are intermediate products between the two ineffective substances
which compose the bulk of hemp oil: a labile excretion product of
the plant, cannabidiol, and a stable end- product, cannabinol.
The conversion of cannabidol into active tetrahydrocannabinol by
a natural environmental influence has been paralleled by
ultraviolet irradiation in vitro. </p>

<p>8. Numerous isomers, homologs and analogs of tetra- and
hexahydrocannabinol are shown to possess the specific marihuana
action. The potency varies enormously and is highest in natural,
optically active=ADlaevogyrous=ADtetrahydrocannabinols. </p>

<p>9. The significance of many of the structural details of the
tetrahydrocannabinol molecule for marihuana activity is
elucidated by quantitative determinations of relative potency.
Special attention was devoted to a study of the importance of
variations in the length of the 3- alkyl side chain of
tetrahydrocannabinols. In studying methyl to nonyl homologs of
the original amyl derivative occurring in nature, it was found
that the maximum potency is not at the amyl, but at the hexyl
homolog, and in two out of four homologous series at the
representatives with still longer side chains. </p>

<p>10. In addition to the ataxia and the psychic action, other
pharmacological attributes of the tetrahydrocannabinols are a
decrease in the respiratory and an increase in the pulse rates in
the non-narcotized dog. </p>

<p>11. The synergistic hypnotic action of marihuana in the mouse
is to be attributed to the otherwise inert cannabidiol. </p>

<p>12. The corneal areflexia action in the rabbit was much
stronger in impure distillate oils than in pure tetrahydrocan
nabinols, which leads to the conclusion that this action is
either poorly reproducible or must be attributed to a different,
as yet unknown, principle. </p>

<p>13. Only one among the numerous cannabinol derivatives, 7-
methyltetrahydrocannabinol, was found to produce a motor
stimulant=AD-convulsant=AD-action concomitant with ataxia action.
A cannabidiol derivative, tetrahydrocannabidiol, was found to
have specific convulsant action in the dog. </p>

<ol>
    <li>A central stimulant (benzedrine) considerably increased
        the ataxia action of marihuana, whereas a hypnotic
        (amytal) had no influence. </li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3">Soma and the Wootton Report</font></p>

<p><font size="3">by Steve Abrams</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In 1967 my organization Soma published a
full paged advertisement in The Times which called for reform of
the law on cannabis. Sixty-five people were persuaded to sign
this document, including leading figures in the arts and sciences
and eminent medical men. our proposals for reform stopped short
of outright legalization. However, legalization was clearly a
long term prospect if they were implemented. The advertisement
declared the existing law &quot;immoral in principle and
unworkable in practice.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement was immediately debated in
the House of Commons, where the Minister of State, Alice Bacon,
announced an expert inquiry headed by Baroness Wootton of
Abinger. In January 1969 the so-called &quot;Wootton Report&quot;
on Cannabis endorsed the position taken in the advertisement,
that &quot;the long asserted dangers of cannabis were
exaggerated, and that the related law was socially damaging, if
not unworkable.&quot;* The Home Secretary of the day, James
Callaghan (now Lord Callaghan) put up a smokescreen. He denounced
the Report, claiming its authors had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for &quot;that notorious advertisement.&quot; However, after
waiting for a year, he quietly introduced legislation to
implement the recommendations of the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legislation expired with the 1970 general
election, but it was immediately reintroduced by the Tory
government and became law as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The
law implemented the unanimous view of the Advisory Committee on
Drug Dependence that end users of cannabis should no longer face
the prospect of imprisonment. This was spelled out by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, in his advice to magistrates on
sentencing. After a prolonged debate Britain had decided to
condone the use of cannabis. Today the law is scarcely enforced
against end users, and the majority of arrests are dealt with by
the procedure of cautioning, without a conviction being
recorded.**&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*Home Office Advisory Committee on Drug
Dependence - Report on Cannabis, 1968, p. 1</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** &quot;The law banning cannabis sale
and use is all but unenforced.&quot; Times leader, &quot;Overdue
for Repeal&quot;, 24 July 1992&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This interpretation of the history of cannabis
law reform has been consistently denied in the media.* A full
paged article in The Independent on July 22, 1992
(&quot;Twenty-five years gone up in smoke&quot;) was summarised:
&quot;On the 24th July 1967 sixty-five of the famous liberal
great and good signed an advertisement in The Times calling for
cannabis to be legalized and ... nothing happened.&quot; Lord
Deedes, writing in The Telegraph on December 15, 1992 said the
same thing about the Wootton Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The last public debate on the subject took
    place in 1969, when Baroness Wootton, then chairman of a
    sub-committee of the Government's advisory body, recommended
    a lightening of penalties for possession of cannabis. As a
    member of the same body, I remember that I thought her
    arguments persuasive but politically unattainable. We
    discussed this amicably until Jim Callaghan, the Home
    Secretary, denounced her proposals in the House of Commons,
    and that was that.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Lord Deedes is at least willing to admit the
existence of the Wootton Report. However, when Lady Wootton died
in 1988, at the age of 91, the work for which she was best known
was not considered worthy of mention in obituaries, notably in
The Independent and the Guardian.** The Telegraph was the only
newspaper which got it right:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">In 1967 her Report on soft drugs caused a
    considerable furore by its recommendation of more lenient
    sentences for offences involving cannabis, and was dismissed
    patronizingly by James Callaghan as &quot;overinfluenced by a
    lobby in favour of legalizing pot.&quot; In 1970, however,
    Callaghan introduced legislation broadly in line with the
    Wootton proposals.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The press celebrated the twentieth anniversary
of many trivial events of the 'sixties, but there does not seem
to have been a single reference in 1989 to the controversy which
dominated the news in January and February 1969. When a long
television interview with Lady Wootton was shown posthumously,
the subject of drugs was not raised, but a voice-over made the
astonishing claim that &quot;in the 'sixties she campaigned for
the legalization of cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*The Times did, finally, print a letter from me
on 24 July 1992. It is interesting to compare this letter with
another which Rees-Mogg refused to print in February 1969. That
letter in included in my article. &quot;Cannabis Law Reform in
Britain&quot; in The Marijuana Papers by David Soloman, Penguin
Books, 1970, pp. 69-79 (UK edition only).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** So far as I know, the Wootton Report
has never been mentioned in The Independent. The authors of the
page published on July 22, 1992, Dina Rabinovich, Emily Greene
and Andrew Brown, listed forty events following on after the
advertisement but pointedly ignored the existence of the Report
and the reduction in penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;In a letter to the Times on February 5th,
1969 in the aftermath of the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report, Lady Wootton and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee,
Sir Edward Wayne, noted that none of the members of the
sub-committee supported the legalization of cannabis. On the
Sunday following publication of the Report, Lady Wootton said in
an article in The Sunday Times : &quot;Even those who wanted to
legalize (cannabis), even the people who signed the Times
advertisement, admit that immediate legalization is not
practical.&quot;*</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report did contemplate the eventual
legalization of cannabis, but the so-called &quot;cannabis
lobby&quot; refused to jump the gun. The 1969 Prospectus of the
Soma Research Association, Ltd. said:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">A Soma delegation gave oral evidence to the
    sub-committee. We took the view that prohibition appeared to
    be an ineffective and socially damaging method of controlling
    the misuse of cannabis. However, we argued that realistic
    decisions about the long term control and possible
    legalization of cannabis could not be made on the basis of
    existing knowledge. Additional research was required, but
    could not be undertaken because the law prohibited research
    in which cannabis was smoked.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement said, &quot;The Government
ought to welcome and encourage research into all aspects of
cannabis smoking, but according to the law as it stands, no one
is permitted to smoke cannabis under any circumstances, and
exceptions cannot be made for scientific or medical
research.&quot; Lady Wootton made the same point in her Sunday
Times article: &quot;People have not been able to undertake
serious research because smoking is forbidden on all
premises.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Research was prohibited because it was an
offence to have charge of premises where cannabis was smoked. The
liability was absolute; guilty knowledge was not required. No
exceptions were judged possible. Cannabis could not even be
smoked by a machine on government premises. The law contained a
term which made it impossible to challenge its own premisses of
the harmfulness of cannabis smoking.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The advertisement asserted that cannabis was
&quot;the least dangerous of pleasure-giving drugs.&quot; The
argument was rehearsed at some length, and those persuaded by it
might well have been inclined to experiment. It came close to
saying that the main danger of cannabis smoking was the prospect
of being arrested. But any criticism of an unjust law is likely
to breed disrespect for the law. The text said, &quot;The
prohibition of cannabis has brought the law into disrepute and
has demoralized police officers faced with the necessity of
enforcing an unjust law.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* Barbara Wootton, &quot;Time and the
Drug Scene,&quot; Sunday Times, 12 January 1969.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the 1967 Tory party conference, the Shadow
Home Secretary, Quintin Hogg (now Lord Hailsham), denounced the
organizers and signatories of the Soma advertisement. He said
that the editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg (now Lord
Rees-Mogg), would never live down the scandal caused by its
publication. Hogg was &quot;profoundly shocked by the
irresponsibility of those who wanted to change the law. Their
arguments were &quot;casuistic, confused, sophistical and
immature:&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is no half-way house in this matter.
    There can be no encouraging the drug up to a point. You
    either sell it over the counter or in the shops or you
    prohibit it altogether.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg replied in a Times leader, &quot;The
Right to Dissent,&quot; on October 23rd:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;We believe that people who want to
    change the law have a right to put their case to the public.
    We do not accept advertisements from people who want to break
    the law. But there is a vital difference between wanting the
    law to be broken and wanting it to be changed. ... Mr. Hogg
    thinks that the subject of drugs is so dangerous that free
    discussion cannot be allowed, that those who disagree with
    him have no right to be heard. Our view would be that his
    rhetorical approach is more likely to repel than to
    persuade.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In January 1969, following publication of the
Wootton Report, Hogg wrote in the Daily Express that it was
necessary to &quot;pursue the addicts of hashish and marijuana
with the utmost severity the law allows.&quot; When the report
was debated in Parliament, on the 27th of January, Hogg insisted
that cannabis was a dangerous addictive drug, the cause of
madness and mayhem. He opposed any reduction in the maximum
penalty of ten years' imprisonment because, in this event,
&quot;the conclusion drawn by the public, by traffickers in the
drug and by potential victims of it would be that the government
were on their way to legalizing its use.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The penalties under the Dangerous Drugs Act did
not distinguish between supply and use. The maximum penalties
were one year on summary conviction and ten years on inditement.
Reducing the penalties for possession of cannabis would involve
putting down the maximum penalty on summary conviction to six
months or less. This would mean, in practice, that users of
cannabis would no longer face the prospect of imprisonment. The
main deterrent to consumption would thus be removed and use would
increase. The stigma of a criminal conviction would soon be
lessened. The police would no longer have much incentive to
enforce the law and in due course they would be unable to enforce
it. Finally, legalization would come, after a generation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The issue of cannabis law reform was raised at
a crucial time. In 1967 the drug laws were in disarray. The
Dangerous Drugs Act applied to drugs controlled under the UN
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, namely heroin, cocaine and
cannabis, including their derivatives and analogues. Amphetamine
and LSD were subject to more moderate penalties under the Drugs
(Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964. LSD had only just become illegal
and barbiturates were not controlled at all. Meanwhile some
cannabis users were punished more severely than heroin users.
Cannabis smoking was regarded as a crime but heroin addiction was
treated as an illness. Doctors had the right to prescribe heroin.
The Court might send a cannabis smoker to prison and send a
heroin user to a doctor.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The formation of Soma was announced in an
article published in Cherwell, the Oxford student newspaper, on
February 1st, 1967. The national press became involved in a
controversy about the prevalence of cannabis at Oxford, arising
out of an article by myself in an anthology, The Book 21 Grass,
edited by George Andrews and Simon Vinkenoog.* The publisher sold
the &quot;story&quot; to The People, who brought&nbsp;it out in
two inch headlines on January 29th. This article was quoted at
length by President Clinton's drugs adviser, Professor Norman
Grinspoon in his book, Marihuana Reconsidered (Harvard University
Press, 1971; pp. 311-312. It was also described in the Times
Literary Supplement (June 15th, 1967) as &quot;a sane and
balanced piece of writing that does much to implement the ...
view that harm rather than good is done by the existing state of
the law.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;&quot;The Oxford Scene and the
Law&quot;, The Book of Grass, Peter Owen 1967, pp. 235-42</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following a press conference on February 2nd to
launch the Book of Grass, an article by Peter Fiddick appeared in
The Guardian, prophetically entitled, &quot;Pot lobby moves into
gear.&quot; (February 3rd) Follow up articles, debating the
prevalence of cannabis smoking at Oxford, appeared The Times, The
Telegraph and the Guardian. There were also several articles in
The Oxford Mail, and the story dominated Cherwell (then edited by
Julian Norridge) for the remainder of the term.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The page one lead in Cherwell was accompanied
by a double paged spread, &quot;The Pot Plot&quot;, a kind of dry
run for the Times advertisement which served as a fact sheet for
the media. &quot;The Pot Plot&quot; was noticed by the popular
press. &quot;Smoke more pot. It's safer than beer,&quot; wrote
Arthur Smith in the Daily Mirror on January 31st. &quot;Make it
legal to take marihuana urges Oxford student&quot; was the
heading for an article in the Mail the following day by Nicholas
Lloyd (former Cherwell editor, now Sir Nicholas, editor of the
Daily Express). On the 6th of February I took part in a
television discussion with the Chief Constable of Oxford C. G.
Burroughs and a psychiatrist from the Littlemore Hospital, Dr.
O'Gorman, on the television program &quot;Today&quot;, from
Birmingham.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, The Telegraph printed the
following letter from me:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">May I make myself clear? Drug addiction is
    extremely rare within the University of Oxford. I do not know
    of any resident member of the University who is addicted to
    narcotics such as heroin and cocaine. There are probably a
    number of addicts to amphetamines and barbiturates, drugs
    which are widely and indiscriminately prescribed under the
    National Health Service.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no reason to believe that the
    widespread use of cannabis (marijuana or hashish or hemp)
    constitutes a problem at the University. Cannabis is
    nonaddictive and there have been no cases at Oxford of
    disorderly behaviour attributable to its influence. The
    consensus of informed medical opinion is that cannabis is
    probably less harmful than alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The civil authorities and the press have
    indiscriminately confused the non-addictive and relatively
    harmless herb cannabis with addictive and harmful drugs such
    as amphetamines and heroin. When challenged on this point
    they argue that cannabis is indirectly harmful because its
    use leads to heroin addiction.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">There is little or no evidence in support
    of this view. One might as well argue that sex leads to
    prostitution. The effects of cannabis and heroin are opposite
    in character. Heroin users are disturbed individuals who need
    to escape from reality; cannabis has the effect of enhancing
    reality.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My qualified estimate that five per cent of
    Oxford students use cannabis when it is available has been
    challenged by authorities who have a strong vested interest
    in minimising the extent of the situation. Students go out of
    their way to conceal information from these authorities, but
    they go out of their way to reveal information to me.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My estimate was based on four years direct
    observation, in the course of which I observed hundreds of
    people smoking and conducted and cross-checked many careful
    interviews. Perhaps I have sources of information which are
    unavailable to the Chief Constable, the proctors and various
    anonymous university officials.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">*&nbsp;According to press reports, &quot;money
changed hands for The People article.&quot; Cf. &quot;Our Man in
Fleet Street&quot;, Drugs and Society, vol. 1, no. 3 (December
1971, pp. 34-35) and the response, a letter from me, in vol. 1,
no. 4, January 1972, p. 37 I was not paid. I had no contract with
the publisher, who sold the story without my permission and
against my protests, which are documented.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I had been playing the numbers game. Five per
cent of junior members of the university translates to five
hundred Oxford students. I felt no compunction about using the
image of the University to challenge the traditional stereotype
of the anti-social drug taker. Following publication of the
People lead, an article in The Times said that my claim that
&quot;at least 500 undergraduates and a few dozen dons&quot;
smoke pot &quot;has been rejected by police, proctors and
dons.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Times quoted the view of the Senior
Proctor, Dr. Robin Fletcher, that my figures were &quot;grossly
exaggerated.&quot; : &quot;The article could create a very bad
image of the University. It is unfortunate for a number of
reasons.&quot; A similar article in The Telegraph quoted the view
of &quot;a senior member of the university who is concerned with
investigations into student health problems&quot; : &quot;I would
be surprised if the number of people using drugs habitually in
the University is more than about twenty.&quot; This official was
presumably D. C. M. Yardley, (now Local Ombudsman) who was Dr.
Fletcher's predecessor. The Telegraph stated that Dr. Yardley had
led an investigation of undergraduate drug use the preceding year
and concluded that no more than fifty students were involved. No
more than thirty took drugs with any degree of regularity. In the
Cherwell lead on February 1st, Dr. Yardley's view of the danger
of cannabis is quoted: &quot;The nervous system of regular pot
smokers is shot to bits. They are mental wrecks.&quot; In The
People he is quoted: &quot;All but those with the strongest minds
will end up seeking bigger and better 'kicks' from heroin and
like drugs. Within the university and nationally, any move to
bring about the acceptance of hemp must be fought.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The matter was resolved by the University
Committee on Student Health, which included several heads of
colleges. I was invited to give evidence to the Committee on
February 15th. They accepted my claim that as many as five
hundred undergraduates had used cannabis. I made the point that
the problem was hardly confined to Oxford and asked the Committee
to press the Home Secretary to institute a government inquiry
into the status of cannabis and LSD. The Chairman of the
Committee was the Head of my college, St. Catherine's, Alan
Bullock (now Lord Bullock, formerly Vice Chancellor of the
University). He told me that my suggestion that the University
press for a Home Office inquiry had been accepted and invited me
to assist him in drafting the letter to this effect, which was
sent to the then Vice Chancellor, Kenenth Turpin on February
28th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first account of the Student Health Report
appeared in a Cherwell exclusive on the 1st of March. On the same
day things looked as if they might be getting out of hand.
Cherwell had announced a &quot;happening&quot; in Wellington
Square, sponsored by International Times. It was to be filmed for
German television. John Hopkins, the organizer, promised to
provide Suzie Creamcheese of the &quot;Mothers of Invention&quot;
pop group on a white horse. The front page of the Oxford Mail for
March 2nd has a photo of hundreds of students pouring out of
Balliol College and another of them marching along the High.
There were signs and banners with legends such as &quot;Death
penalty for pot&quot; and &quot;God moves in a mysterious
way.&quot; The Deputy Chief Constable stated that &quot;more than
500 students disorganized the city centre for over two
hours.&quot;*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Oxford Mail account says that the police
tried to clear Wellington Square, whereupon the
&quot;happening&quot; reformed as a procession down St. John's
Street. They moved straight across Beaumont Street and St. Giles,
without pausing for traffic, in through Balliol College back
entrance (where the police could not follow) and out again
through the front entrance in Broad Street. The procession
continued on through the Turl and the High to Carfax. The
&quot;happening&quot; was also covered in the national press. The
Sun called attention to six undergraduates tied together with a
plastic rope crawling along the High Street, insisting they were
climbing a mountain. The Sun also remarked on the presence of a
girl on horseback carrying a sign which said, &quot;Free Suzie
Creamcheese!&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report of the Committee on Student Health
was published on April 3rd and reviewed in The Times the
following day. The Times article says, &quot;At the Health
Committee's suggestion, the Vice Chancellor of Oxford University,
Mr. K. C. Turpin, is to ask the Home Secretary for an urgent
national enquiry into the dangers of drug taking.&quot; It said
the university was concerned at the numbers which might be
experimenting with cannabis. The following article by Nicholas
Lloyd appeared in the Daily Mail:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The pot takers. 500 Oxford students use
    marijuana&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">About 500 Oxford undergraduates smoke
    marijuana,, says a committee of dons. The Committee was set
    up to report on the health of students at the university. In
    a letter to Kenneth Turpin, the Vice Chancellor, it say that
    an independent claim that about five per cent of the 10,000
    students take drugs is probably correct.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But it maintains that the situation at
    Oxford is not exceptional and that a similar proportion of
    students at other universities take drugs. The committee,
    headed by Mr. Alan Bullock, Master of St. Catherine's
    College, says that drug taking is a national problem. It
    calls for a full investigation into the effects of different
    drugs and says that public policy could then be based on
    scientific fact instead of prejudice.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On Tuesday students at St. Catherine's
    College passed a motion by 24 votes to 4 in favour of making
    marijuana - known as 'pot' - legally available.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;* In fact the numbers were swelled
because students from the Oxford Polytechnic, in their &quot;rag
week&quot;, joined the proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 7th of April, the Home secretary, Roy
Jenkins, announced the appointment of an investigation led by
Baroness Wootton. She was to head a &quot;sub-committee on
hallucinogens&quot; of the Advisory Council on Drug Dependence,
appointed in December 1966, enacting a recommendation of the
Second Brain Report the previous year.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We hoped for something earth shaking from the
Wootton Committee. We hoped for a published report on cannabis
that would bear comparison with the New York Mayor's Report on
Marihuana (the La Guardia Report) of 1944 and the East Indian
Hemp Drugs Report of 1893-94. The first stage of the campaign had
been concluded.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The chain of events leading to the appearance
of the advertisement involved an interaction with the affairs of
the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and the so-called
&quot;underground.&quot; One of the reasons for raising the
subject of cannabis with urgency in the favourable context of its
use at Oxford was the need to combat what a Times leader (&quot;A
Dangerous Press Camapign&quot;) soon called &quot;the deliberate
sensationalism that underlines the present campaign against
&quot;drugs.&quot; The Soma advertisement said &quot;The crime at
issue is not drug abuse but heresy.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Traditionally, the use of cannabis had been
largely confined to Blacks, Indians and Arabs.* Muslims broadly
tolerated the use of cannabis but prohibited alcohol, which is,
literally, sacred to Christians, and also to Jews. The new rock
music could be represented as a fusion of black rhythms and
Eastern spirituality. The gentle undulations of the music were
also explicitly sexual. For decades the Americans, in particular,
had portrayed the use of cannabis as degenerate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The News of the World replied to the article in
the People by accusing the Rolling Stones of abusing drugs.
(February 3rd) The same night Mick Jagger appeared with Hogg on
the Eamon Andrews talk show. Jagger told Hogg that he too had
been to university, and seemed to get he better of him. Then, I
thought, he got above himself and announced, impulsively, that he
would sue the News of the World for libel. The newspaper panicked
and went to the Scotland Yard Drug Squad. The head of the Drug
Squad, Chief Inspector Lynch later told me that he refused to
act. He said that he was not expected to stamp out cannabis, but
to keep its use under control. If he arrested Mick Jagger every
lad in the country would want to try some pot. He was, after all,
head of the drug squad, not head of the Lynch mob.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* The statistics published with the Wootton
Report show that 1964, the first year in which white offenders
outnumbered blacks, was also the first year in which a minority
(48 per cent) of cannabis offenders were sent to prison.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As is well known, the News of the World had
more success with the local police in West Wittering, where Keith
Richards lived. In the subsequent trial, Jagger's counsel,
Michael Havers (later Lord Havers, also Mrs. Thatcher's attorney
general in the &quot;Spycatcher&quot; case) alleged that the
newspaper used an agent provocateur. The arrests were made on
February 12th, but the story did not break until the 19th. Only
the Telegraph named those arrested, Keith Richards, charged with
the absolute offence of permitting premises to be used for
smoking cannabis, and Mick Jagger, charged with possession of
amphetamine. George Harrison has said that the Beatles were at
the party that was raided, but the police waited until they
left.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Perhaps the beginning of the entire sequence of
events was the arrest on cannabis charges on December 30th 1966
of the aforementioned John Hopkins (Hoppy), a member of the
editorial board of the underground newspaper &quot;International
Times.&quot;* The &quot;underground&quot; was a literary and
artistic avant garde with a large contingent from Oxford and
Cambridge. Hoppy, for example, was trained as a physicist at
Cambridge. The underground had found an enemy in Lord Goodman,
Chairman of the Arts Council, who went over the head of the Home
Secretary, Roy Jenkins, and appealed directly to the Director of
Public Prosecutions to mount a police raid on the Indica bookshop
where International Times was edited.** Goodman had an animus
against (Barry) Miles, co-proprietor of the bookshop with Peter
Asher, and also a member of the Editorial Board of IT. In
December 1966 Eric Whitte nominated Miles to serve on the Arts
Council Literary Advisory Panel. Goodman had been infuriated when
his appointment was announced to the press on January 30th, and
had him thrown off.***&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hoppy, who was on bail, organized the greatest
of the underground events, the &quot;24 Hour Technicolour
Dream&quot; at Alexandra Palace on April 29th, to raise funds for
the defence of the paper. When his trial came up, he insisted on
pleading not guilty though he had no defence. He had a previous
conviction for possession of cannabis but insisted on a jury
trial, which meant going before a judge of the Crown Court and
risking a longer sentence than one year. Hoppy completed a
classical recipe for self-imprisonment by lecturing the court on
the need to legalize cannabis. Sentencing him to nine months
imprisonment on June 1st, the Deputy Chairman of Inner London
Sessions, A. Gordon Friend, said:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">I have just heard what your views are on
    the possession of cannabis and the smoking of it. This is not
    a matter I can overlook - You are a pest to society.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">* Lord Thompson, proprietor of The Times,
obtained an injunction to stop the use of the word
&quot;Times&quot; in the title. The paper then became
&quot;IT&quot; until Max Handley restored its correct name in the
mid seventies. Incidently the girl in the logo is not Clara Bow.
Its Theda Bara.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;** According to Tom Driberg.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">*** Peter Fryer - &quot;A Map of the
Underground&quot;, Encounter, October 1967, pp. 9-10</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;A sympathetic account of the case
was published by Clive Goodwin in Tribune and Christopher Logue
contributed a poem &quot;For John Hopkins, imprisoned in
Wandsworth Jail&quot;, which appeared in the New Statesman on
July 7th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The next day, June 2nd, Hoppy's friends met at
Indica. I raised my idea of advertising in The Times.* Miles said
he thought he knew where the money might be found. He had been to
school with his partner, Peter Asher, who was half of the pop duo
&quot;Peter and Gordon&quot;, a &quot;one-hit wonder.&quot; Peter
Asher's sister, Jane, was Paul McCartney's girlfriend. McCartney
had several times contributed small sums to keep IT going. By the
end of the day he had offered to guarantee the cost of the
advertisement, which was #1800.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I was not as surprised as I might have been at
this turn of events. I had gone to the meeting thinking about the
plight of the Beatles and their record company, EMI. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; had been officially released the preceding day. I
had purchased a copy from the HMV Shop in Notting Hill on the
27th of May and had been listening to it continuously. Earlier in
the year the single Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane suggested that
the Beatles had become enthusiastic proponents of LSD. &quot;Sgt
Pepper&quot; reinforced this impression. McCartney had also given
an ill-advised interview to Life magazine. The Beatles had
&quot;pissed&quot; on their clean image as explicitly as the
Rolling Stones had &quot;pissed&quot; on a garage forecourt in
June 1965.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The establishment was ready to send the Rolling
Stones to prison. Now it looked as if the Beatles would be next.
Something had to be done to get them off the hook. Nobody wanted
them arrested, but it was difficult to see an alternative. I
proposed, in effect, to change the issue from LSD to pot and to
associate the Beatles with leading figures in the arts and
sciences in a legitimate protest from 'within the system.' It is
not in any way surprising that McCartney was willing to back the
advertisement or that Rees-Mogg was willing to publish it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;I went along with Miles to discuss the
project with McCartney. Unless my memory is playing tricks on me,
McCartney thrust a copy of Sergent Pepper into my hands and said,
&quot;Listen to it through headphones on acid.&quot; The
conversation that followed was, however, sedate. McCartney was
well aware of the power of public statements coming from the
Beatles. He realized that if they spoke out on too many issues,
their influence would be diluted. But pot was going to be an
exception. McCartney said that the Beatles and their manager
Brian Epstein would all put their names to the advertisement and
he agreed that the project would be left entirely in my hands. He
hoped that his participation in the funding could be kept quiet.
It came to the attention of the Evening Standard the next day. I
received a call from the Diary, from Max Hastings or Julian
Norridge translated from Cherwell. &quot;How could you possibly
know?&quot; I asked. The source, I was immediately told, was the
editor, Charles Wintour.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Later I spoke to McCartney on the phone. We
agreed that Phillip Oates could say in his first
&quot;Atticus&quot; in the Sunday Times (eventually published on
July 9th) that all four Beatles would be among those contributing
to the cost of the advertisement. Then, on the eve of
publication, when I attended The Times to inspect the proofs, the
advertising manager, R. Grant Davidson, got cold feet.
Publication had been delayed for a week whilst he checked all the
names. Now he asked for payment in advance. I rang the only
person I had met in the Beatles organization, Peter Brown of the
music publishing company, Northern Music (NEMS). He sent round
his personal cheque for #1800. Someone later told me that he had
been reimbursed from a Beatles advertising account. Probably none
of the Beatles was out of pocket.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As the advertising manager's caution indicates,
the publication of the advertisement was a near thing. The
deciding factor in persuading the Times to publish and the
Beatles to meet the cost was probably the sensational case of the
Rolling Stones, which began on the 27th of June. The verdicts
came on Thursday the 30th. Richards was sentenced to a year in
prison on the premises charge and Jagger was given three months
for possession of four amphetamine tablets known as 'black
bombers.' Both were first offenders. They were released on bail
the following day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That night there was a spontaneous
demonstration outside the News of the World building in Fleet
street. No one had cared enough to demonstrate in Fleet Street
since the first world war, and no one would ever care enough to
do so again. The police turned dogs on the demonstrators and six
people were arrested. The demonstrations continued into the early
hours of the morning. The next day, Richards and Jagger were
released on bail. It being Friday, the members of the underground
club, UFO, over a thousand persons in extravagant dress, marched
at midnight from Tottenham, Court Road to the statue of Eros at
Piccadilly Circus, where they were joined by several hundred
members of other West End clubs. I remember Pat Arrowsmith of CND
wringing her hands in anguish, being quite unable to comprehend
our tactics.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We then formed up and marched to Fleet Street.
Again the police turned dogs against us, and one demonstrator was
bitten. On Saturday the News of the World demonstrations
continued for the third night running. A picture of part of the
crowd, myself among them, appeared on the front page of the News
of the World. Mick Farren, a future editor of IT and lead singer
of the Social Deviants, was beaten by the police and a number of
others were arrested, including Suzie Creamcheese.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Rees-Mogg's celebrated leading article,
&quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot; appeared in The
Times on the same day, Saturday the 1st of July. My admiration
for it is subject to qualification. The editor did not address
the issue squarely. He was moved by the spectacle of Jagger in
handcuffs, but said nothing at all about the twelve months
sentence meted out to Keith Richards, who was convicted of being
in control of premises used for the purpose of cannabis smoking.
The leader did not question the justice of this charge, which was
an &quot;absolute&quot; offence that did not require guilty
knowledge on the part of the offender. Rees-Mogg did not mention
cannabis at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The last &quot;event&quot; preceding
publication of the Times advertisement was the famous
&quot;Legalize Pot Rally&quot; at Speakers Corner in Hyde Park on
Sunday the 16th of July. This was one of a series of
&quot;be-ins&quot; which had been taking place at monthly
intervals at Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath. &quot;Vast
publicity for legalize pot rally. Steve Abrams appears on
television with amazing regularity,&quot; wrote International
Times. In the event, several thousand people turned up, many
wearing flowers and bells and many smoking pot openly. Most of
the national newspapers gave &quot;flower power&quot; a double
paged spread the next day.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I presided at the meeting and introduced Alan
Ginsberg. When a policeman asked him to stop playing his
harmonium, which went against the by-laws, he was filmed giving
the policeman a flower. I decided to break up the meeting into
small groups. I remember Stokely Carmichael, Alexis Korner,
Carolyn Coon, Spike Hawkins, Clive Goodwin and Adrian Mitchell
speaking simultaneously, each mounted on a soap-box and
surrounded by a few hundred people. I was surprised to findmy
remarks used in a schools program on &quot;The Right to
Protest&quot; that seemed to be repeated on television most
afternoons. Everyone had a good time in Hyde Park. No one was
arrested. We had struck another blow against the image of the
unkempt and violent drug addict. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The aim of the advertisement was to influence
the Wootton subcommittee on hallucinogens. They had restricted
themselves to pharmacological and medical studies on both
cannabis and LSD. We wanted them to report on cannabis alone, to
emphasize the social aspect of its use and to make specific
recommendations for law reform.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Crude attempts were made to discredit the
professional competence of the sub-committee. Following
publication of the Report on Cannabis, Quintin Hogg was quoted in
The Times, on January 9th, 1969: &quot;A less suitable committee
is impossible to imagine. Half the subcommittee are doctors and
there is not a judge, or anybody practising at the criminal bar,
among them.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The eleven members of the sub-committee were K.
J. Barraclough, a stipendiary magistrate and Chairman of the
Poisons Board; Dr. Thomas Bewley, a psychiatrist in charge of the
addiction clinic at Tooting Bec Hospital, the Secretary and later
President of the Society for the Study of Addiction; Peter
Brodie, Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard in charge of the
C.I.D., also Vice President of Interpol; Dr. P. H. Connell, a
psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital; Dr. J. D. P. Graham,
professor of pharmacology; Dr. C. R. B. Joyce, Head of the
Department of Pharmacology at London Hospital Medical College,
later Director of Research at Ciba, Switzerland; Sir Aubrey
Lewis, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry at the Maudsley; Dr.
Nicholas Malleson, a psychiatrist, Reader in Student Problems and
Head of Student Health at London University, also the most
experienced LSD therapist in Britain; H. W. Palmer of the Glaxo
Pharmaceuticals Company; Timothy Raison, Editor of New Society,
later Tory MP, Minister of State for Home Affairs; Michael
Schofield, a sociologist who had conducted several studies for
the Home Office; and Baroness Wootton, a distinguished social
scientist, a serving magistrate, Governor of the BBC, veteran of
several Royal Commissions.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I decided that Dr. Malleson was the key member
of the subcommittee. Had it been a jury, he would probably have
been the foreman. I approached him and offered to rewrite the
text of the advertisemnt until it satisfied him. In return, I
asked to use his name privately in soliciting signatures. I had
met Michael Schofield as a fellow member of the committee
preparing a Report on Drugs and Civil Liberties for the National
Council on Civil Liberties (NCCL). I asked him to sign the
advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The sub-committee met 17 times between April
1967 and July 1968. At the first meeting the plan was to report
to the main committee in October. The report was to be restricted
in scope and to treat both cannabis and LSD. Before the
advertisement appeared, the committee limited its enquiries to
pharmacological and medical questions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">According to Michael Schofield, the
sub-committee were not favourably disposed to begin with. At the
first meeting one member said that research was not necessary and
that all the sub-committee had to do was to work out ways to
&quot;stop the spread of this filthy habit.&quot; During the
early meetings, six members wanted to take a hard line, four were
undecided and two felt that the penalties for possession were too
severe.* The two liberals were probably Schofield and Malleson.
It follows that Lady Wootton took some persuading.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there was a consensus of informed medical
opinion on cannabis, the sub-committee would have to recognize
it. The important thing was to do what could be done to persuade
them to report on cannabis alone and to broaden the scope of
their enquiry, to give proper consideration to the social aspects
of cannabis use and to make specific recommendations for law
reform. My endeavour in the text of the advertisement was to
define the issues for a public debate.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The debate began immediately. The advertisement
was mentioned in Parliament on the day of its appearance. Four
days later, the headlines were about the savage sentence of five
years' imprisonment and a 10,000 fine or an extra year which
Judge Argyle passed on a black man charged with
&quot;possession&quot; of cannabis. He did this, he said to
express his disapproval of the Soma advertisement.** He also
claimed that 69 of 70 heroin addicts in Birmingham had
&quot;started on cannabis.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the same day, Friday the 28th, the Soma
advertisement was the subject of an adjournment debate in the
House of Commons proposed by Paul Channon. The Minister of State,
Alice Bacon (Later Baroness Bacon), claimed that 97 per cent of
heroin addicts known to the Home Office had &quot;started on
cannabis.&quot; She seems to have invented this figure. Her
speech was racist in tone and credited cannabis and LSD with the
importation of negro music and Indian spirituality. She compared
McCartney unfavourably with a now forgotten singer called
&quot;Lulu.&quot; However, she said that the issues raised in the
advertisement would be considered by the Wootton sub-committee,
and she committed the Government to taking their Report into
consideration in framing new legislation.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Michael Schofield - The Strange Case of Pot,
Pelican Books, 1971. Schofield has a chapter about
&quot;Reactions to the Wootton Report&quot; but he ignores
Callaghan's assertion that the sub-committee had been
&quot;overinfluenced&quot; by the &quot;lobby&quot; responsible
for the Soma advertisement. He also fails to mention the fact
that he was a signatory to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** The man was regarded by the Court as a major
supplier. Press reports did not specify the quantity of cannabis
found in his possession. The sentence was reduced on
appeal.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this debate William Deedes outdid himself.
He was under the illusion that hashish is far more dangerous than
marijuana.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Does anyone believe that if we were to end
    the black market in cannabis leaf by legalizing it, a black
    market in resin would not begin. That could undermine the
    nation. That is why I believe that those who sign public
    announcements assume very grave responsibilities unless they
    can back what they say with more knowledge than most of
    us,believe we have.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Tom Driberg, who signed the Soma advertisement,
read from his father's evidence to the East Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission in 1892. I briefed Driberg and Channon and got to sit
in the strangers box on the floor of the house during the debate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On Monday the 31st of July, a week following
the publication of the advertisement, the conviction of Keith
Richards was quashed and Jagger's prison sentence (for possession
of amphetamine tablets) was reduced to a conditional discharge.
The Soma advertisement had asked for the abolition of the
premises offence and included a plea for the release of all those
imprisoned for possession of cannabis.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma was an informal organization when the
advertisement appeared. Later, it was incorporated as the Soma
Research Association, Ltd. There was a very distinguished Board
of Directors, including the most eminent living scientist,
Francis Crick, F.R.S., who won a Nobel prize for his discovery
with James Watson of the structure of DNA. The Board included
four psychiatrists: Professor Norman Zinberg of Harvard, whose
experiment published in 1968 was the first authorised by the US
government and became the strongest affirmation of the relatively
harmless character of cannabis smoking; Dr. Anthony Storr, a
leading establishment figure and author; Dr. R. D. Laing, the
leading radical analyst of the day; and his colleague at the
Philadelphia Association, Dr. David Cooper. The other directors
were The Revd. Kenneth Leech, the leading authority on drug abuse
within the Church of England, an early advocate of the
&quot;legalization&quot; of cannabis; Francis Huxley, the Oxford
anthropologist, and myself. Cooper, Crick, Huxley, Laing and
Storr were signatories to the advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Soma had five employees, including Don Aitken,
the Secretary and Archivist; Derek Blackburn, Psychologist; and
Adam Parker-Rhodes, Pharmacologist. Premises were at 438, Fulham
Road, SW6 and 4, Camden High Street, NW1. Soma had active
research and medical programs, the latter in collaboration with
the doctors at an affiliated NHS surgery in Notting Hill. Dr. Ian
Dunbar was Medical Director of Soma and Dr. Sam Hutt was Medical
Correspondent. Aitken and Blackburn prepared a bibliography of
cannabis. We did the first human experiments with the active
principle of cannabis, tetrahydracannabinol (THC), synthesized in
our laboratory. We compared the action of the isomers of THC and
tried to distinguish euphoria from intoxication by measuring the
apparent tridimensionality of visual perception, the extent to
which the world appeared, as it were,
&quot;spaced-out.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We could work with THC because its structure
had not been determined when the Dangerous Drugs Act was last
revised. It had not been placed under UN control. Before we made
THC, we obtained supplies of a purified form of cannabis, the
alcoholic extract, which was made available on prescription.
Extracts and tinctures of cannabis had been removed from the
Pharmacopoeia but were still listed in the
Extrapharmacopoeia.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Dunbar wrote a prescription for me on the
18th of August 1967. I finally encashed it at an obscure branch
of Boots in the East End. The prescription came with a letter
that said: &quot;This is an historical document. I suggest you
frame it.&quot; Later a pop group, the Aynesley Dunbar
Retaliation brought out a famous LP called &quot;Dr. Dunbar's
Prescription.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I put it to the Home Office Drugs Branch that
most of the distinguished signatories to the advertisement and
many of those who commented on it had openly declared their use
of cannabis. For example, the following paragraph ended a letter
to The Guardian published on July 8th and shown on television in
&quot;What the Papers Say&quot; :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... If anyone remains unconvinced by this
    mass of expert advice then I can only offer them the evidence
    of my own experience having smoked marijuana for many years
    without ill effects whatsoever.</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p><font size="3">Yours faithfully</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">Clive Goodwin</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">79 Cromwell Road</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">London SW7</font></p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;The Home Office obtained a legal opinion
that the part of the law which made it an absolute offence to
keep premises for the purposes of cannabis smoking did not apply
to the smoking of purified cannabis; that is to say, smoking
preparations based on &quot;extract of cannabis,&quot; BPC. An
approach was then made to the UN drugs control apparatus, who
increased the nominal UK quota of cannabis imports from 15 kilos
per annum to 254 kilos. (Five hundredweight) Ganja was imported
from India and made up by the botanical firm, Ransoms of Hitchen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the early debates was a seventy minute
television special on September 1st, 1967, a mock trial in the
series &quot;Your Witness&quot; in which Sir John Foster, Q.C.
was to argue the case for cannabis against Leon Brittan. Sir John
dropped out and was replaced by Jonathan Aitken, a signatory to
the advertisement (now a minister in the Government).* Aitken
proposed to call me as a witness. I had in mind smoking pot as I
gave evidence and presented myself for cross examination. The BBC
researcher, Esther Rantzen, agreed that this would be good
television, and so I approached Dr. Dunbar for the first
prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Sir John was at a meeting at the House of
Commons in June at which he, Jonathan Aitken, Humphry Berkeley,
Tom Driberg and Brian Walden all agreed to sign the
advertisement. He later atoned for withdrawing from the
advertisement and the debate by joining Soma. Indeed, he sent
along his friend Princess Feuzy, who was a subject in our
research program.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Leon Brittan was fully aware that
extracts and tinctures were controlled separately from cannabis
and cannabis resin and that the prohibition on the use of
premises for smoking cannabis did not apply to these purified
forms. However, he was also aware that my live appearance would
undermine his case. He therefore fudged the issue and insisted
that if I appeared the BBC would be liable to prosecution. It was
compromise in the end. I was not permitted to appear live, but
the BBC filmed me smoking at home, passing any risk onto my
landlord. The corporation thus obtained some stock film that was
reused a number of times.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 10th of October, 1967 Jonathan Aitken
and I successfully argued a cannabis law reform motion against
Professor Francis Camps and Robert Pitman at the London Hospital
Medical College. The next day The Telegraph reported the warning
that Professor Camps had given about the alleged dangers of
cannabis, without noting the fact that his opinion had been
rejected by a large audience of doctors and medical students.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I came up against Professor Camps again at a
conference on drugs of the Student Humanist Federation at
Nottingham University on January 5th to 7th, 1968. The problem
was to get in the way of the newspapers reporting his remarks. My
solution was to announce at the beginning of my talk that I would
be speaking under the influence of a prescribed form of cannabis.
The Times, The Telegraph and The Guardian reported this event as
if it had been a high wire act.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 21st of November 1967, I had spoken
against Leon Brittan at a Teach In at Guys Hospital. I did not
like his arrogance or his willingness to pontificate on a subject
of which he knew nothing. Fate was kind to me. After the
publication of the Wootton Report in 1969, I had a unique
opportunity to flatten him. We debated the Report at Bristol
University. Leon Brittan recalled the &quot;Your Witness&quot;
television program. He told the Bristol Union I had insisted on
being filmed at home because I knew I could not speak in public
under the influence of cannabis. I rose to my feet, Leon Brittan
gave way. I turned to the president of the Union, and being
advised that smoking was permitted, I resumed my seat, removed an
enormous joint from my pocket and lit up. I went through an
elaborate pantomime to distract the audience during his speech. I
pretended to be &quot;zonked.&quot; Then it was my turn to speak.
I was in my best form, and I think the Union voted unanimously
for the motion. Afterward, Brittan refused to believe I had been
smoking. He said I had pretended to inhale.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Inevitably, the debate that gave me the
greatest satisfaction was at the Oxford Union on October 19th,
1967. In my article in &quot;The Book of Grass&quot; I had said
that the one place in Oxford where cannabis was not smoked was
the Union society. Now, just months later, the Union voted in
favour of changing the law. Dr. Laing and I were opposed by Ann
Mallalieu and the Revd. John McNicoll. William Paton, the
Professor of Pharmacology, spoke against cannabis from the floor,
Earlier in the evening a motion of censure was passed against the
Proctors, who had suspended Cherwell because of its coverage of
drugs. Dr. Yardley spoke from the floor in this debate. He and I
had threshed out this matter on the television program &quot;24
Hours&quot; on the 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the Thatcher period, every attempt was
made to blame the permissive society&quot; of the 1960s on the
political left. In fact, the left was left out, at least in 1967.
Cannabis was a libertarian issue which became very popular with
the Young Conservatives. When I spoke at a teach-in organized by
the Young Communists League, I faced a hostile audience for the
first time. Speaker after speaker rose to say that cannabis was a
capitalist plot. I was &quot;intent on distracting&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">the workers from their revolutionary
duties.&quot; John McNicoll, who also spoke in this debate, had
accused me, in the Evening Standard diary, of being a
crypto-communist. He said I had taken up drugs when lecturing at
Leningrad University. Now, with a delicious political instinct,
he accused me of being an American. In a long interview with
Penthouse magazine, published in December 1968, I said that
though Tariq Ali and Clive Goodman had signed the Soma
advertisement, &quot;We want nothing to do with their
revolution.&quot; I added: &quot;You can't smoke
Marxism.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I think the decisive event in the debate about
cannabis may have been a meeting of the Society for the Study of
Addiction at the premises of the British Medical Association on
November 7th 1967. The press were barred from this meeting, which
was attended by officials from the Home Office, senior police
officers, most of the Advisory Committee and many of the leading
medical authorities. Dr. Storr and I spoke on behalf of Soma. We
were opposed by Dr. Cedric Wilson of Liverpool University, who
made a great fool of himself by including gangrene among the
symptoms of chronic abuse of cannabis. He also repeated the claim
made by William Deedes in the House of Commons on 28 July, that
there were seven million hashish addicts in Egypt and that the
Government there was at its wits end to know what to do about it.
I quoted an article published the preceding year in the U.N.
Bulletin on Narcotics, a study sponsored by the Egyptian
government, which said there were 180,000 &quot;habitues&quot; of
cannabis in Egypt and that a study of matched groups of users and
non-users did not reveal any significant differences between the
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The discussion from the floor was the important
part of the meeting. One expert after another rose to affirm the
innocuous status of cannabis. They seemed to vie with one another
in devising new arguments. It may not have reached the height of
a religious revival, but I was left with the feeling that a
consensus had been realized, that the Djinn was well out of the
bottle.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In November 1967 the reforming Home Secretary,
Roy Jenkins, exchanged places with James Callaghan, the disgraced
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had devalued the pound. In
opposition, Callaghan had been the paid Parliamentary lobbyist
for the police federation. He was &quot;Sunny Jim, the
policeman's friend.&quot; His agenda was not that of the Labour
party; indeed, it is difficult to find a more destructive
influence in the history of that party. Through his opposition to
vital trade union reforms, his failure at the Treasury and his
pointing up what he called the &quot;permissive society&quot; as
the legacy of his predecessor at the Home Office, he probably
cost Labour the 1970 general election. Later his incompetence as
prime minister cost Labour the 1979 election, and in 1983 and
1987 he intervened against his own party because of his
opposition to nuclear disarmament.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Jenkins defended the non-partisan social
reforms of the decade and insisted that Britain was a
&quot;civilized society,&quot; rather than a permissive one.* I
recall taking part in a Third Program discussion of perhaps
unprecedented length (from 8:45 pm until past midnight)
on&nbsp;November 9th, 1969, in which Warden Sparrow of All Souls,
Michael Foot, Professor Alasdair MacIntyre (a signatory to the
advertisement) and I discussed the question, &quot;Is Britain
Civilized.&quot; Bernard Levin was in the Chair. I am now
inclined to the view that Britain has over the past quarter
century become intolerant of dissent and especially of
dissenters, that it has many and various means of denying them
the &quot;oxygen of publicity&quot;, so that the question might
seem to be not whether Britain is a &quot;civilized&quot;
society, but whether, as a prime minister seemed to imply, it
aspires to be a &quot;society&quot; at all.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* Transport House distributed the text of
Jenkins' remarks to the Abingdon Constituency Labour Party on
July 19th, 1969 </font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the Home Office, Callaghan was intent on
salvaging his popular reputation, and happy to take the low road.
He made known his opposition to the Wootton Report. He made a
number of public interventions which could be interpreted as
attempts to sabotage the Report, or to dictate terms to the
Committee. He was not obliged to publish the Report, formally
submitted to him on November 1st, 1968 and he must have realized
that the publication of an expert report which exonerated
cannabis would do everything to undermine the existing
legislation, since it virtually said that the only reason to
refrain from smoking cannabis was the fact that it remained,
&quot;for the time being,&quot; illegal. There were reports in
the papers that some members of the Committee were prepared to
resign if the Report was not published. I was myself
contemplating a pirated edition of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Printed copies of the Wootton Report were
delivered before Christmas and distributed on January 7th, 1969.
The press were advised that Callaghan intended to denounce the
findings and recommendations of the Report.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report went further than the Soma
advertisement in affirming the relative harmlessness of cannabis.
An often quoted summary (paragraph 29) allied the conclusions of
the Wootton Report with those of the great reports of 1893 and
1944:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Having reviewed all the material available
    to us we find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions
    reached by the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the
    Government of India (1893-4) and the New York Mayor's
    Committee on Marihuana (1944) that &quot;the long term
    consumption of cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful
    effects.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Paragraph 67, introducing the Section on
General Conclusion and Recommendations states:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;The evidence before us shows that:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">An increasing number of people, mainly
    young, in all classes of society are experimenting with this
    drug, and substantial numbers use it regularly for social
    pleasure.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There is no evidence that this activity is
    causing violent crime or aggressive anti-social behaviour, or
    is producing in otherwise normal people conditions of
    dependence or psychosis, requiring medical treatment.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The experience of many other countries is
    that once it is established cannabis-smoking tends to spread.
    In some parts of Western society where interest in
    mood-altering drugs is growing, there are indications that it
    may become a functional equivalent of alcohol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;In spite of the threat of severe
    penalties and considerable effort at enforcement the use of
    cannabis in the United Kingdom does not appear to be
    diminishing. There is a body of opinion that criticises the
    present legislative treatment of cannabis on the ground that
    it exaggerates the dangers of the drug and needlessly
    interferes with civil liberty.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The Committee proposed that new legislation be
drafted that would distinguish between hard and soft drugs and
between drug trafficking and drug taking. It proposed that the
penalties for cannabis be reduced to the point where minor
offences would not merit imprisonment. The key recommendation was
to reduce the maximum penalty on summary conviction for
possession to four months imprisonment. The committee also
proposed to abolish absolute offences (i.e., the liability in
respect to the use of premises) and called for a legal framework
for cannabis research and medical treatment using cannabis and
its variants.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Government's expert advisors had confirmed
the apparently surreal assertions of the cannabis lobby. This
completely knocked the pins from under any attempt to enforce or
justify the law. It discharged the burden of proof that the
&quot;cannabis lobby&quot; had assumed. Whatever was said against
us could also be said against the Advisory Council and against
Callaghan, who had not been bound to publish the Report. The
terms of the debate were now changed. If the Government wanted to
send people to prison for smoking cannabis, they had to show that
its use was harmful and socially damaging. But the further step
of legalizing cannabis depended on amassing proof, over a period
of time, that cannabis was not a social menace.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Report went out of its way to credit the
influence of the Times advertisement. I quote from an article in
the Guardian diary which was planted with a view to facilitating
Callaghan's denunciation of the Report. It was a set up,
illustrated by a photograph.&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Soft Sell&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">LOBBYISTS are the great unseen, the great
    unhonoured, not least by Government enquiries. But Steve
    Abrams' pot-boilers have never been that kind of lobby, and
    the Wootton Committee isn't that kind of enquiry. The
    Cannabis report out this morning delivers a rare and specific
    testimonial:&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Our first enquiries were proceeding -
    without publicity - into the pharmacological and medical
    aspects when other developments gave our study new and much
    increased significance. An advertisement in the Times on the
    24th of July 1967 represented that the long asserted dangers
    of cannabis were exaggerated and that the related law was
    socially damaging, if not unworkable. This was followed by a
    wave of debate about these issues in Parliament, the Press
    and elsewhere, and reports of enquiries e.g. by the National
    Council for Civil Liberties. This publicity made more
    explicit the nature of some current &quot;protest&quot; about
    official policy on drugs; defined more clearly some of the
    main issues in our study; and led us to give greater
    attention to the legal aspects of the problem. Government
    spokesmen made it clear that any future development of policy
    on cannabis would have to take account of the Advisory
    Committee's report. Accordingly, we decided to give first
    priority to presenting our views on cannabis.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Publication of the Wootton Report provoked an
organized campaign of vilification in the popular press. A famous
headline in The Daily Express described the Report as a
&quot;junkies charter.&quot; Some people in high places and some
vested interests were getting worried. Until then, the issue of
legalizing cannabis had seemed to be a joke.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the Parliamentary debate on the Wootton
Report on January 29th, 1969, Callaghan gave his reasons for
rejecting, or ostensibly rejecting, the Wootton Report:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;I think it came as a surprise, if not
    a shock, to most people when that notorious advertisement
    appeared in the Times in 1967 to find that there is a lobby
    for legalizing cannabis. The House should recognize that this
    lobby exists, and my reading of the Report is that the
    Wootton sub-committee was overinfluenced by this lobby. I had
    the same impression as the Rt. Hon. and learned gentleman
    (Quintin Hogg) that it was compromise at the end; that those
    who were in favour of legalizing 'pot' were all the time
    pushing the other members back, so that eventually these
    remarkable conclusions emerged, that it would be wrong to
    legalize it but that the penalties should be reduced. The
    existence of this lobby is something that the House and
    public opinion should take into account and be ready to
    combat, as I am. It is another aspect of the so-called
    permissive society, and I am glad that my decision has
    enabled the house to call a halt in the advancing tide of
    so-called permissiveness.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Articles in the Evening Standard
(February 3rd) and other newspapers said that the Chairman of the
Advisory Council, Sir Edward Wayne and Lady Wootton were both
contemplating resignation to mark their protest against the Home
Secretary's insulting remarks in Parliament. On February 5th the
Times published a joint letter from them, which said, in
part:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">We regard this statement as offensive to
    our distinguished colleagues and to ourselves, and
    particularly to the eminent medical men who signed our
    Report, and we particularly deprecate the implication of the
    emotive word 'lobby' in this context. We would also point out
    that after hearing the evidence no member of the
    sub-committee recommended legalization.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">In October I wrote in the Soma Newsletter (np.
3, pp. 4-5) that Callaghan, for all his blustering, had little
option other than to change the law:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">The Government is now drafting
    comprehensive new legislation on psychotropic drugs,
    including cannabis. The legislation aims at introducing more
    flexible control of drugs and consolidating the control
    presently exercised in respect of the Dangerous Drugs Act and
    the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act. Apparently the new
    legislation will distinguish between drugs by introducing a
    two tiered system of penalties for what may, for convenience,
    be termed &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; drugs. Our
    understanding is that the problem of whether to classify
    cannabis as a hard or soft drug has not yet been faced. It is
    felt, however, that because the Home Secretary has asked the
    Wootton Committee to continue in its advisory capacity, it
    will be very difficult to justify the continued
    classification of cannabis as a hard drug in the context of
    new legislation. ...</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">It should be recalled that despite his
    posturing the Home Secretary did not refuse to implement the
    Wootton Report. He merely refused to legislate unilaterally
    and immediately on cannabis at a time when new comprehensive
    legislation was already being planned.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The story of implementing the Wootton Report is
told in a little noticed passage in the Crossman diaries.(pp.
836-7) After the legislation had been through the Home Affairs
Committee, there was an &quot;absolutely outrageous press
leak.&quot; This presumably refers to a page one lead in the
Sunday Mirror on February 1st, 1970 :&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">DRUG LAW SHOCK Jim Changes his Mind.
    Penalties for 'pot' smokers to be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Home Secretary James Callaghan has has had
    a dramatic change of mind on drugs. He has decided that
    people who smoke 'pot' should no longer be punished as
    severely as those using heroin. He has gone further by
    deciding that the penalties for possessing both hard and soft
    drugs should be cut.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">... Mr. Callaghan only a year ago
    championed the cause of holding the line against drug
    permissiveness. ...Last year Mr. Callaghan denounced what he
    called &quot;a notorious advertisement&quot; in the Times -
    signed by many public figures including the Beatles - which
    urged that possessing cannabis should either be legalized, or
    at most punishable by a fine of not more than #25.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Crossman's diary entry for Thursday February
26th says that Callaghan had come back to the cabinet to say that
&quot;he now proposed not to have any reduction at all in any
penalties on cannabis.&quot; Crossman notes that this was
unusual. &quot;One usually only brings things to Cabinet when
there is disagreement at a Cabinet Committee.&quot; As the
discussion continued &quot;it became absolutely clear that the
issue was whether to kowtow to public opinion or not.&quot; The
Cabinet divided. &quot;Every member of the cabinet who had been
to university voted one way and everyone else voted the
other.&quot; Wilson voted with the antis. Having been outvoted by
a clear majority, Callaghan published his Misuse of Drugs Bill on
March 11th.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The myth that Callaghan refused to implement
the proposals of the Wootton Report owes its survival to the fact
that the labour government was defeated in the general election
of 1970. However, the legislation was bipartisan and it was
reintroduced by Reginald Maudling for the tories. It became law
as the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The maximum penalty for
possession of cannabis on summary conviction was reduced by half
to six months. When the Act received the Royal Assent in 1973 the
Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham (formerly Quintin Hogg), advised
the conference of the Magistrates Association on sentencing.
(Times, 12 October 1973) He reasserted the insistence of the
Advisory Council that minor offences did not merit imprisonment.
Lord Hailsham told magistrates to treat cannabis users with
&quot;becoming moderation.&quot; He said: &quot;Set aside your
prejudice, if you have one, and reserve the sentence of
imprisonment for suitably flagrant cases of large scale
trafficking.&quot; It must have been difficult for him to set
aside his own prejudice long enough to say that, but he
did!&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ten years after the Wootton report, Ronald Butt
wrote in The Times, without intended irony, that we should be
grateful to Callaghan who put his foot down and saved us from the
permissive society by rejecting the Wootton Report. (17 March
1979) When he wrote this article Butt should have known that the
Criminal Justice Act of 1977 had reduced the maximum sentence on
summary conviction for possession to three months, less than the
four months proposed in the Wootton Report. He should also have
been aware of the 1978 Report on Sentencing of the Advisory
Council, which proposed a further reduction in penalties, ending
the status of possession of cannabis as an &quot;arrestable
offence&quot; (i.e. one for which a warrant is not required to
make an arrest) and abolishing the residual powers of the courts
to deprive offenders of their liberty. However, the Report noted
that the Courts were already observing this condition in
practice; they no longer imposed prison sentences for simple
possession offences.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Margaret Thatcher was heavily indebted to the
tobacco and alcohol lobbies. She sought to use the drugs issue
for political purposes. The wise counsel of civil servants and
professional advisers was by-passed when a planeload of tame MPs
departed for a Cooks Tour of American lowlife organized by the
U.S. Drugs Enforcement Agency.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thatcher opened the doors to smugglers by
reducing the number of customs staff and she spent several
million pounds of public money on advertisements for the use of
heroin and cocaine, against the advice of the Advisory Council.
But the use of cannabis was so widespread that any attempt to
focus on its dangers would have derailed the entire campaign.
Cannabis was not singled out for attention and soon references to
cannabis became conspicuous by their absence. There was no way to
stress the dangers of narcotics without pointing up the relative
harmlessness of cannabis. On this issue Thatcher was caught in a
trap of her own making. Of course she refused to implement the
further proposals for cannabis law reform made in the 1978 Report
on Sentencing and re-affirmed in the 1982 Report on
Cannabis.&quot; However, she did make a crucial concession,
granting Chief Constables discretion to caution offenders rather
than bring them to trial. This practise has grown and now the
majority of offenders are cautioned and thus escape
conviction.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>* <font size="3">Report on A Review of the Classification of
Controlled Drugs and of Penalties Under Schedules 2 and 4 of the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (15 December 1978)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence was
an ad hoc body. The Misuse of Drugs Act made it a statutory body
akin to the Poisons Board. It was renamed the Advisory Council on
the Misuse of Drugs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">** Home Office Advisory Council on the Misuse
of Drugs - Report of the Expert Group on the Effects of Cannabis
Use (1982).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was implemented twenty years
ago. Since that time we have had a &quot;half-way house&quot;,
and possession of cannabis has been virtually
&quot;decriminalized.&quot; One solicitor, Bernard Simons, who
has dealt with many drugs cases, described the present situation
in The Independent on July 22nd:&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">... For me, twenty-five years ago, it was
    really important in my life - as a libertarian issue. Today
    the police rarely prosecute; they're told to administer
    cautions, and even bringing small amounts into the country
    doesn't lead to court. In my youth, in Notting Hill, people
    were stopped and searched all the time. and they had nothing
    on them. You used to have police raids on parties, where
    they'd find a bit of cannabis and arrest everyone in the
    room. Twelve people would appear in court charged with the
    same bit of cannabis. It doesn't happen any more, certainly
    not in London - though I can't speak for rural Wales. &nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The police arrest users by accident. If they
are looking for a dealer or a thief and they find some 'dope',
they make a charge. The few cases that show up in the statistics
as leading to imprisonment are artefacts; for example, a sentence
served concurrently for possession of cannabis and another more
serious drug or non drug offence. In some other cases the
quantities of cannabis seized are rather large.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A decision to legalize cannabis in the context
of EC drug policy would be bolstered by the results of such
research as has been done in the past twenty years, mainly in
America. However, the decision is likely to depend on the size
and growth of the market. The media have muddied the waters by
exaggerating the extent of cannabis smoking in the 1960s. A
leader and several articles in The Independent have insisted that
cannabis use is currently greater than at any time since the
1960s. In fact, official statistics imply a steady growth in
cannabis use over the past quarter century. The total of cannabis
seized in 1967 was 295 kilos and 457 plants. Currently seizures
are running at about 1,000 kilos per week. In twenty-five years
seizures have increased by two orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis is normally sold in the form of
hashish at a price of about #30 for a quarter of an ounce. That
is a week's supply for a user who smokes all day every day. I
assume that a typical user smokes cannabis two or three times a
week and consumes about a sixteenth of an ounce per week. On this
basis, the current level of seizures alone would be enough to
support a user population of half a million. But the customs use
a notional figure of five or ten per cent for the average level
of seizures.* It is therefore likely that there are several
million regular cannabis smokers in Britain, up to ten per cent
of the population. Probably the market has been saturated.
Cannabis is not everyone's cup of tea, and many people do not
enjoy its effects or are unable to experience any effect at all
from taking it. The experience of decriminalization in Holland is
that further relaxation of control does not produce any long term
increase in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">* In the 'sixties the proportion of seizures
was probably lower than it is today, partially because the
penalties did not distinguish users from suppliers.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The legalization of cannabis may now be on the
cards, but how will it be done? &quot;Legalization&quot; is an
extremely vague expression. My personal view has always been that
the vendor should be the State; that any other solution would
introduce a vested interest in maximizing the use of cannabis,
and, in one way or another, advertising it. In oral evidence to
the Wootton sub-committee on December 5th, 1967 I said that the
recent legalization of gambling had been a disaster because the
crooks who controlled illegal gambling remained in control of
legalized gambling. Yet there is today, in 1993, a strong opinion
in favour of legitimizing the existing trade in drugs, much of
which is in the hands of organized crime and terrorist
groups.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mr. Lucas, a psychiatrist, asked me if I
thought the tobacco companies should sell cannabis to help them
to phase out of the production of tobacco. I said that the
tobacco companies should not be allowed to sell cannabis and that
I doubted they should even be permitted to sell tobacco.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Originally, I hoped that cannabis could be made
available through liberal prescribing of standardized
preparations. Since the 1970s I have supported those who favour a
rationing system loosely tied to the National Health System. I
think that prospective users should be required to purchase a
cannabis licence, which could be obtained from a NHS surgery. The
licence would allow them to purchase up to the equivalent of one
ounce of cannabis per month from a chemists shop. This would make
it a slight nuisance to obtain cannabis. The doctor would not be
asked to prescribe the drug, but would be entitled to know his
patient was a cannabis user. All profits from such a scheme could
go to the NHS. It would be worth a few billions per annum. In
this way the gangsters are cut out, a small overflow is provided,
the forms of cannabis available are standardized and purified,
and the profits go to a good cause. Moreover, such a scheme would
be reversible. A detailed consideration of alternative licensing
systems was provided in a book, Cannabis : Options for Change,
published by the semi-official Institute for the Study of Drug
Dependence in 1979.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Hopefully, the solution of nationalizing
cannabis may be the only one which is compatible with the control
requirements of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, to
which Britain is a signatory. The Convention requires all states
to enact laws prohibiting the &quot;possession&quot; of cannabis
and providing for deprivation of liberty in suitable cases. This
convention was brought in as a result of long pressure from the
U. S. Treasury, which acts on behalf of the alcohol lobby in
America, and controlled or prohibited cannabis in America in the
same way that it prohibited &quot;moonshine&quot;, as tax
evasion. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics controlled by H. J.
Anslinger, a former commissioner of prohibition and a relative of
Hoover's, was part of the U.S. Treasury. It was succeeded by the
Drugs Enforcement Authority, which is part of the Department of
Justice.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Wootton Report was followed by similar
reports in other countries including the </font><a
href="../ledain/NONMED.HTM"><font size="3">Le Dain Report</font></a><font
size="3"> in Canada and the </font><a href="../nc/ncmenu.htm"><font
size="3">Shafer Report</font></a><font size="3"> in America.
Following publication of the latter, by a Presidential
Commission, the government looked into the legal status of
cannabis under the Single Convention. Apparently, they obtained
an opinion based on the French text of the Convention that the
offence of possession&quot; had the meaning of the offence
described in British law as &quot;possession with intent to
sell&quot; as opposed to simple possession. The conclusion seemed
to be that cannabis could be legalized, though only with the
state acting as the seller.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It will, however, be difficult or impossible to
resist a claim from the tobacco industry. For example, one
tobacco company pays Lady Thatcher a fee in excess of #1,000,000
p.a. to act as a &quot;consultant.&quot; Such sums are paid out
to protect the public image of an industry which may have killed
off a hundred million people worldwide in the course of the
twentieth century. To the tobacco industry the Single Convention
is a paper tiger.&nbsp;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Supplement&nbsp;</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the 8th of July 1968, the News of the World
devoted its entire pre-tabloid front page to an attack on me.
There was a marvelous picture, borrowed from the Sunday Times and
retouched, and an arrow pointing at my head. The headline said:
This dangerous man MUST be stopped! The article had no content;
it attacked my plans to manufacture small quantities of THC for
research purposes but admitted that the Home Office was aware of
the project and had no objection to it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Four days later, on the 12th of July, the
Oxford drugs squad searched the digs of a gentleman named Stephen
Abraham, who lived with his landlady, Miss Susan Ratcliffe, in a
house at 88, Sunningwell Road. A roach, a spent cannabis
cigarette, was found in the room he occupied with Miss Ratcliffe.
The police also found an empty bottle of tincture of cannabis and
some tobacco with a green tinge. Stephen Abraham was an American
and a member of Pembroke College. He had just taken first class
honours in maths. He smoked dope like a chimney and he too had a
prescription (arranged by me) from Dr. Dunbar.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I am sorry that Graham Greene (a signatory to
the Soma advertisement) is not alive to read this, to learn about
the &quot;other Steve Abrams&quot; I kept in Oxford to get
arrested on my behalf.*&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Steve Abraham beat a strategic retreat to
America, but on August 1st, his girlfriend, Miss Ratcliffe, was
charged with the absolute offence of allowing him to smoke
cigarettes dipped in cannabis tincture in their room. The Court
and the police accepted that Abraham had a legal
prescription.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The case was heard at Oxford City Magistrates
Court on October 17th, 1968. The Bench of Magistrates, included
Mrs. H. Y. Bullock, wife of Sir Alan Bullock, the Head of my
College, then elevated to the rank of Vice Chancellor. She must
have been aware of the deliberate confusion of identities. Soma
paid half the cost of the defence, who were represented by our
solicitor, Martin Polden. Expert evidence for the defence was
provided by Dr. Ann Robinson, assistant to Professor Francis
Camps at London Hospital. (Dr. Robinson is now Professor of
Ferensic Medicine at London Hospital Medical College.)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have no criminal record and have never been
charged with any drugs offence. I was an Advanced Student of St.
Catherine's College from 1960 to 1967. I have never met Miss
Ratcliffe and have never been to 88, Sunningwell Road, Oxford. In
1968 I lived at 81, Holland Road, London W11 with Jane Firbank,
to whom I was then married.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The forensic scientist from Aldermaston who
gave evidence for the police said that his tests did not
distinguish between cannabis resin and extract of cannabis. He
promptly concluded that they were the same substance. He insisted
that the product of evaporating the alcohol in tincture of
cannabis (made by adding alcohol to extract of cannabis) was in
fact cannabis resin, whereas the extract was made by percolating
cannabis leaf (marijuana) in alcohol. It contained only those
components of cannabis that dissolved in alcohol.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It was argued in evidence that Abraham was
entitled to be in possession of a bottle of tincture of cannabis
but not to open it. If a fraction of the alcohol that the extract
was mixed with evaporated, that would be a step in the direction
of &quot;manufacturing cannabis resin.&quot; By the same token,
opening a bottle of cough syrup might be construed as a step in
the direction of manufacturing morphine. By pouring the contents
of a bottle of tincture of cannabis, cost 30/onto a tin of
tobacco, Abraham was supposed to have, transformed the house into
a &quot;factory&quot; for manufacturing Ireefers', according to a
report in The Times. According to The Telegraph, Abraham
manufactured enough cannabis &quot;to supply five hospitals for
seven years.&quot; That is to say, he used up a bottle of
tincture of cannabis, the same amount used by the five Oxford
hospitals over the past seven years.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case was upheld on appeal by Brian
Gibbens, the Recorder of Oxford on January 11th, 1969, four days
after the Wootton Report was published. The decision was
criticised in legal and medical journals for making a nonsense of
the law and it was ignored outside Oxford. However, the
impression was created that following a campaign in the New of
the World, I had been convicted (in absentia) of
&quot;manufacturing&quot; cannabis resin in Oxford.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This may be a great joke, but it got on my
credit records here and in America, and it left the police with
an open warrant in my name. I was picked up several times in
London, the premises of Soma were raided, and I realized that it
was time to pack it in. Callaghan had just published his Drugs
Bill, so I could claim a victory.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is buried somewhere in the personal
columns of The Times, probably in January or February 1969 a
small announcement advertising the fact that Steve Abrams is not
Steve Abrams &amp;c.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On July 24th 1992, twenty-five years after the
publication of the Soma advertisement, a new full paged
advertisement appeared in The Times, sponsored by the Release
Legal Emergency and Drugs Service Ltd., registered charity no.
801118.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Registered charities are not permitted to
campaign for law reform, but Release, in soliciting contributions
to defray the cost (#17,000) of the advertisement altered their
stationery to remove the designation of their charitable status
and allowed the press, e.g.? the Independent, to describe them as
a &quot;soft drugs campaigning group.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Prospective contributors and signatories to the
Release advertisement were sent a poster reproduction of the Soma
advertisement, together with advice that affirmed or strongly
implied that they had published the original as their calling
card, twenty-five years earlier. None of the signatories to the
Release advertisement got to see the embarrassing document to
which their names were appended.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I told the organizers of the Release
advertisement that they were in breach of copyright in
circulating posters of the Soma advertisement, and that they were
also guilty of the additional offence of &quot;passing off.&quot;
The Director of Release, Michael Goodman, a barrister, and one of
the &quot;founders&quot; of the organization, Mr. Rufus Harris, a
law clerk, ignored my protestations and authorised the use of a
photograph of me, ostensibly smoking a joint, on the invitation
to their 25th anniversary party.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Release did come into existence in 1967, but it
took no significant part in the cannabis law reform movement of
the late sixties. To begin with, Release was a 24 hour referral
service for a group of solicitors who specialised in defending
drugs cases. Release would have cut itself off from reputable
sources of funding had it campaigned for the legalization of
cannabis. The solicitors, who were onto a good thing, would have
been compromised.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The earliest reference to Release in The Times
is in October 1967 and all of the references are to fund raising
stunts arranged by Carolyn Coon or criticisms of the police. More
surprisingly, perhaps, there is no reference to Release in the
&quot;pot people's newspaper&quot; International Times in the
summer of 1967. A complete history of the early work of Release
is given in The Release Report by Caroline Coon and Rufus Harris
(Sphere Books, 1969). This book covers the wider interests of the
authors in the drugs problem but the text contains no reference
to the Wootton Report or to an advertisement in the Times. The
authors seem to think it wrong to, as James Callaghan said,
&quot;look at one drug in isolation.&quot; They content
themselves with a bland and ambiguous injunction, still in use,
to &quot;change the drug laws.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If this seems tame, it is. Release has a
government grant of #3,000 per week, covering sixty per cent of
its operating expenditure. In twenty-five years Release has not
done anything adventurous, nor has it published any worthwhile
research. Now independent action is out of the question. The
orchestrated pre-publicity for the 1992 advertisement, with the
media acting in concert, regurgitating handouts from the Home
Office Press office was an embarassing confirmation of the extent
of news management in the one party state that is Britain
today.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I know that things are hard, and that an
organization like Release must be encouraged to establish its
street credibility and to raise money on its own by tapping a
vein of sympathy among a drug using population of several
millions and preaching to the converted. I am not happy about
Release living on my good will, but I am amused that the Home
Office now want to get in on the act, to claim that they
themselves inspired the 1967 advertisement.&nbsp;</font></p>

<h1>The Wootton Report</h1>

<p><b>Extract from 'The Strange Case of Pot' by Michael Schofield
(Penguin, 1971). </b></p>

<hr>

<p>Schofield was a social psychologist who sat on the Wootton
Committee and, dismayed by its reception, which led to the
introduction of the Misuse of Drugs Act, he subsequently
published this book. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the introduction, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The original title of this book was to have been 'The
    Case For And Against Pot.' It was intended to present both
    sides of the controversy and weight the evidence before
    coming to a conclusion. But once the myths were cleared, it
    became obvious that the case for and against was not evenly
    balanced. By any ordinary standards of objectivity, it is
    clear that cannabis is not a very harmful drug. But the
    simple ranging of issues side by side is to superficial an
    approach for what is a very complex situation - really a
    social problem, much less a legal problem, and still less a
    medical problem.' </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The book is divided into three major parts. In the first
    five chapters I present the basic information about cannabis
    and compare it with the other illegal drugs. In the next six
    chapters I try to explain the public attitudes to cannabis
    and discuss the main controversies. In the last five chapters
    I attempt to describe the legal and sociological aspects, and
    end by suggesting a more sensible plan of action.' </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 7, The Wootton Report</h2>

<p>- In this chapter, Schofield discusses the background to the
establishment of the Wootton Committee and then goes on to
outline the committee's recommendations, elucidating each one. </p>

<h3>Other Reports</h3>

<p>At first Government committees were only concerned with the
opiates, and in particular with heroin addiction. The two reports
of the Interdepartmental Committee under Lord Brain in 1961 and
1965 hardly mentioned cannabis. In the first report the committee
decided that cannabis was not within their terms of reference and
concluded: 'In our view cannabis is not a drug of addiction; it
is an intoxicant.' In the second report they noted briefly that
there is 'a risk that young people may be persuaded to turn to
cannabis' which was something of an understatement even in 1965. </p>

<p>One important recommendation in the second Brain report was to
set up a Standing Advisory Committee to keep under review the
whole problem of drug dependence. As this was not a static but a
changing problem, it would be useful to bring together a group of
experts with authority to advise to advise on the social as well
as the medical aspects. This committee was set up in early 1967
under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Wayne, MD, PhD, DSc, FRCP,
FRCP(G). Twenty-two other members were appointed, nine of whom
were doctors. A small secretariat was formed to help the
committee, but there was no money to pay for research and no
special facilities. Some of the members were doctors treating
addicts, but most of them had only a limited amount of knowledge
of drugs although all of them have learnt over the years. </p>

<p>Without the facilities to initiate or carry out research, this
committee cannot be expected to provide new facts or make
important discoveries. All that the members can do is to discuss
the matter between themselves and listen from time to time to
witnesses called to give evidence because they are experts in
some particular aspect of drug use. But nearly everyone who gives
evidence to this committee does so as the representative of an
organisation which has a special interest in drugs. Conflicting
views will be heard from the representatives of other
organisations. The function of the committee is essentially
judicial and its purpose is to reconcile the conflicting claims
of its witnesses. As there is a wide variety of opinion
represented among the members, the suggested solutions to the
various problems of drug dependence are obtained by compromising
between opposing views. The reports which are issued from time to
time usually consist of an aggregation of existing opinions.
including those of the chairman, the committee members, and the
witnesses. A research team of three or four people working full
time is more likely to produce more penetrating and workable
solutions to the problems of drug use than a committee of
prominent citizens meeting three or four times a year to compile
and select from conflicting expert opinions. </p>

<p>None the less the committee has been able to give useful
advice to the Home Office and Ministry of Social Security on the
best way to implement the earlier recommendations of the Brain
committee. Treatment centres for heroin addicts have been set up
and special arrangements were introduced to control the outbreak
of methedrine injections. Perhaps the most important work has
been done in the sub-committees which have met more regularly
than the main committee. There have been sub-committees on
rehabilitation (published as a report by HMSO in 1969) and health
education (the results were circularised by the Department of
Education), amphetamines, LSD, and the powers of search and
arrest (these reports were published by HMSO in 1970). In April
1967 a special sub-committee was appointed to review the
available evidence on the pharmacological, clinical,
pathological, social and legal aspects of cannabis. After
seventeen meetings under the chairmanship of Baroness Wootton,
the sub-committee's report was published in January 1969. </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Recommendations</h2>

<p><b>(1) We recommend that in the interest of public health, it
is necessary for the time being to maintain restrictions on the
availability of cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- Although it is stated in the report that the consumption of
cannabis in moderate doses has no harmful effects, the committee
felt less sure about the mental effects. This recommendation,
therefore, is intended to be a temporary measure and should be
reviewed from time to time, when more is known about the effects
as a result of medical and social research. Meanwhile the courts
should recognise that there is considerable variation in the
personalities and motives of people who use cannabis. </p>

<p><b>(2) Every encouragement, both academic and financial,
should be given to suitable projects for enquiry into the
cannabis problem.</b> </p>

<p>- It follows that if there is a lack of information on an
important and controversial problem, every effort should be made
to provide research facilities. Although three working parties
have been set up by the medical Research Council and an Institute
for the Study of Drug Dependence has been established, progress
is very slow. It is inevitable that research into drug use will
be a lengthy business, but it is disquieting that even three
years after the formation of the Government's Advisory Committee,
very few large-scale research projects have even been started. </p>

<p>In March 1970, the Home Office issued a list of research on
drug dependence. This list contained ten biochemical and
pharmacological studies, mainly concerned with the developments
of techniques for detecting cannabis in the body. there were no
cannabis studies listed under the clinical and treatment section.
Five studies were listed under the social and psychological
section; three of these (Chapple, 1966; Paton, 1968; Tylden,
1968) who had written papers strongly opposed to the use of
cannabis even before starting the research; only one of the five
has been undertaken by a sociologist. so far the Social Science
Research Council has not supported any researches on the use of
cannabis even though it is in the area of sociology that we most
need information. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee found that it was impossible to estimate
the number of people who used cannabis and the guesses seem to
range between 30,000 and 300,000. It is clearly impossible to
make sense of statements about the social consequences of
widespread use of cannabis until there are some reliable
estimates of the prevalence of regular users. No detailed
information is available about the extent of cannabis use by
immigrants. There is an immediate need for sociological and
psychological studies to define the different social groups and
to describe the personalities of people who smoke cannabis.
People do not hesitate to criticise the young for taking drugs,
but in fact no one knows how many adolescents do take cannabis,
how many use the drug only occasionally at parties and week-ends,
and how many take it regularly. Only a well-planned research
would show if there are differentiating characteristics between
users who take only cannabis and people who used to take cannabis
but have now given up all drug use. </p>

<p><b>(3) The law should progressively be recast to give
Parliament greater flexibility of control over individual drugs.</b>
</p>

<p>- This was one of the few recommendations which the Home
Secretary found acceptable, although it seems likely that he does
not interpret the 'greater flexibility of control' in the same
sense as the Wootton Committee. Mr Callaghan, speaking during the
debate on the Wootton report, said that he would put before the
House proposals which would give him more power to handle the
problem in a much more flexible manner. He then went on to
criticise the restrictions of the 1964 Drugs Act which in fact
does not apply to cannabis. He wanted the power to bring new
synthetic drugs under the Act as they were developed and became
popular with users, and he also mentioned the need to have
stronger legal control over manufacturers, doctors, chemists, and
others who distribute the drugs. he felt that there was 'a clear
risk that each new fashion of drug taking will find new gaps in
the defences, which will only be plugged too late' and the
solution would be 'to have a single comprehensive code which
would rationalise and strengthen the Government's powers.'
(Quoted from Hansard, 27 January, 1969, column 967). There is
much substance in Mr Callaghan's remarks about changing fashions
in the drugs scene but this has nothing to do with the Wootton
report which is about cannabis, a drug that is already
fashionable and is hardly ever prescribed by medical men. It is
difficult to see what the Home Secretary's call for new
legislation has to do with cannabis unless he feels that one drug
is much like another, an attitude of mind that Lady Wootton and
her colleagues were most anxious to alter. </p>

<p>The Wootton committee suggested changes in the law because
there is now a better understanding of the reasons why people use
drugs. Criminological studies have cast doubts on the
effectiveness of deterrents and the general law on the treatment
of offenders has been changed considerable. The committee felt
that 'the penalties for cannabis offences have gone unreviewed
for too long'. Their idea of flexibility was that the law should
be adjusted according to the dangers of the drug and the way it
is misused. </p>

<p><b>(4) The association in legislation of cannabis and heroin
and the other opiates is inappropriate and new legislation to
deal specifically and separately with cannabis and its synthetic
derivatives should be introduced as soon as possible.</b> </p>

<p>- There are two reasons for this. Many people agree that the
confusion between cannabis and heroin leads to misunderstandings
and, in some cases, to injustice. The committee also stated quite
clearly that the present penalties for possession of cannabis
were altogether too high. The Government accepted the third
recommendation for reasons other than those given by the
committee, and after some hesitation, the fourth recommendation
was also incorporated into the new (Misuse of Drugs) Bill,
although the penalties for possession of cannabis are still
severe. </p>

<p><b>(5) Unlawful possession of cannabis without knowledge
should not be an offence. The practicability of distinguishing
between possession intended for use and possession intended for
supply should be examined.</b> </p>

<p>- This brings to notice two of the several difficulties
encountered in a law which is about possession when what we are
really concerned about is the misuse of drugs. Although a recent
test case was taken as far as the House of Lords the resulting
decision was by no means clear because the issues in that
particular case were complex. The law should make it quite
certain that a person cannot be incriminated, for example, by
someone putting cannabis in his coat pocket without his
knowledge. The police maintain that is extremely difficult to
catch someone in the act of dealing in cannabis or any other
drug. The unsatisfactory solution to this problem under the 1965
Act was to retain high maximum penalties for the offence of
possession so that the courts could sentence a man who had been
found guilty of one offence (i.e. possession) as if he has been
found guilty of another (i.e. supply). It is a form of justice
that is open to question, it is a bit like the bench saying to a
motorist: 'You have been caught exceeding the speed limit and we
have been told that you had been drinking rather heavily;
however, we can't prove that you were drunk, so we are going to
give you a very heavy sentence for speeding.' The proposals for
the new legislation allow this practise to continue: although the
new offence of 'possession with intent to supply' is introduced,
a maximum penalty of five years for the possession of cannabis is
proposed. It is difficult to imagine a situation where the simple
possession of cannabis deserves such a severe sentence. The new
Bill distinguishes between possession and trafficking and
increases the penalty for selling cannabis to a maximum of
fourteen years. This reflects the public demand for heavy
penalties for traffickers which is based on a misunderstanding of
the role of the dealer. Nevertheless if a man is making money out
of selling an illegal substance, it is reasonable to expect him
to be dealt with more severely than someone who is merely using
the drug. </p>

<p><b>(6) Possession of a small amount of cannabis should not
normally be regarded as a serious crime to be punished by
imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- This is a very radical recommendation and one which caused a
large amount of adverse comment in the press. But informed
opinion is coming round to the idea that prison is not a sensible
way to treat people who wish to use cannabis. What even informed
opinion found it difficult to take was the explicit statement
that possession in not a serious crime. But the committee went
still further in paragraph 90 of the report, where they state
that prison is the wrong place even for those who supply on a
limited scale. they do not attempt to define what they mean by a
limited scale, but even a fairly strict definition would include
about nine out of ten of the transactions between users and
sellers because the amounts involved are so small. </p>

<p><b>(7) The offence of unlawful possession, sale or supply of
cannabis should be punishable on summary conviction with a fine
not exceeding 100, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding
four months, or both such fine and imprisonment. On conviction or
indictment the penalty should be an unlimited fine, or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both such fine
and imprisonment.</b> </p>

<p>- Thus the committee recommended considerable reductions in
the penalties. The penalties for possession under the 1965 Act in
force when the committee reported, the penalties in the new Bill
and the penalties recommended in the Wootton report are
summarised as follows: </p>

<pre>
<font size="2">Maximum         1965 Act                1970 Bill               Wootton penalties                                                               Report
Summary conviction:
Fine                    250            400            100 Imprisonment    12 months               6 months                4 months
Indictment:
Fine                    1,000          unlimited               unlimited Imprisonment    10 years                5 years         2 years</font>
</pre>

<p>Some members of the committee argued strongly against any kind
of prison sentence for simple possession, but in the end were
persuaded to agree to a maximum penalty of four months
imprisonment because this sentence would allow the defendant the
option of going for trial by jury and also because a prison
sentence gives the judiciary the chance to deal with what the
committee called 'difficult individual cases'. The committee were
aware that a substantial part of the smuggling of cannabis is in
small amounts (paragraph 37) and is not exploited to any
significant extent by professional criminals (paragraph 38).
Therefore they expected that most cases would be dealt with
summarily by imposing a small fine. the reaction to this showed
that it was a most unpopular recommendation. The home secretary
and the opposition spokesman on Home Affairs both said that this
recommendation would make it appear that Parliament was condoning
the smoking of cannabis. ('If we were to adopt what is proposed
or started to take a namby-pampy attitude about it, we should
need our heads examined. I range myself wholeheartedly behind the
Home Secretary on this issue.' Quentin Hogg in Hansard, 27
January 1969, column 957) </p>

<p><b>(8) The existing law which inhibits research requiring the
smoking of cannabis (section 5, Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965) should
be amended to allow qualified workers to study its use both by
observation and by laboratory and social experiments.</b> </p>

<p>- There has been considerable uncertainty about the smoking of
cannabis for research purposes with the result that no serious
study has been made in this country on the effects of smoking on
humans, even in laboratory conditions. As the social factors are
even more important than the pharmacological problems, it is
essential that researchers should be free to study these
phenomena by observations and experiments outside as well as
inside the laboratory without the risk of prosecution. Although
the Home Secretary gave the lack of information as the reason for
rejecting many of the recommendations in the Wootton Report, it
was notable that he never mentioned this in the House of Commons.
In fact this was one of the earliest and most urgent of the
suggestions made by the full Standing Advisory committee, long
before the Wootton report was published. Many members realised
that their work was hindered by the shortage of information that
could only be obtained by fairly elaborate and lengthy research.
It was suggested that a short Bill should be put before
Parliament to make research on cannabis possible without the risk
of prosecution. It was thought that such a bill would not arouse
much opposition, but the Home Office advisors to the committee
felt that this plan was not practical. They maintained that for a
short Bill on the subject of research into cannabis could not be
confined to this subject and far-reaching amendments would be
added during its passage through Parliament. so it was decided to
wait until the Government was ready to introduce comprehensive
legislation into which a special clause would be included to
allow bona fide research workers to investigate the effects of
smoking cannabis. But in fact three years have been lost between
the time when the law on cannabis research might have been
changed and the introduction of this new legislation. It is
possible that much useful information could have been obtained in
that time, information which would have been invaluable during
the preparation of the new Bill and the subsequent discussion of
various proposals. </p>

<p><b>(9) Section 5 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965 (permitting
premises to be used for smoking cannabis, etc.) should be
redefined in scope so as to apply to premises open to the public,
to exclude the reference to dealing in cannabis and cannabis
resin, and to remove the absolute nature of the liability on
managers.</b> </p>

<p>- This recommendation has been partly approved by the Home
Secretary in the proposals for new legislation so that occupiers
and managers commit an offence if they knowingly permit a drug to
be used or sold in their premises. This will obviate the
liability of the landlord of private premises who would have been
convicted under the old law even if he was able to show that he
did not know that pot was being smoked in his house. But the Home
Secretary has rejected the suggestion that this should only be an
offence in public premises. </p>

<p><b>(10) The Advisory Committee should undertake, as a matter
of urgency, a review of police powers of arrest and search in
relation to drug offences generally, with a view to advising the
Secretary of State on any changes that may be appropriate in the
law, particularly as regards cannabis.</b> </p>

<p>- The Wootton committee seemed to think this task was too big
for them because they felt that the question of police powers
could not be realistically considered in relation to cannabis
alone. But there is no doubt that this is a most important issue.
There is a growing public concern about the way the police are
using their powers of search and arrest and many youth workers
see this as one of the main causes of the substantial
deterioration in the relations between young people and the
police. It may be said that this recommendation is a bit timid.
In a large numbers of cases, the police search for drugs in
general, but this is not true of every case. There must be
occasions when the reasonable grounds for suspicion relate only
to the use of cannabis; for example, it is the only drug that has
a pungent smell. the very extensive police powers of search and
arrest, which may be necessary for the more harmful drugs, are
difficult to justify for cannabis, the possession of which,
according to the report, is a relatively minor offence. This
recommendation was thought to be 'a matter of urgency' and a new
sub-committee under the chairmanship of William Deedes was set up
soon after the Wootton report was published. In an early debate
on drugs Mr Deedes said in the House of Commons: 'It makes no
sense for the police to go round raiding and stripping young
people at parties to find drugs, some of which their elders treat
as a staple diet. the posture against the young becomes morally
untenable.' But his report turned out to be rather a
disappointing document, with few positive recommendations. </p>

<p><b>(11) The development of the manufacture of synthetic
cannabinols should be kept under review and, if necessary,
control should be imposed under powers provided by the Pharmacy
and Poisons Act, 1933, and The Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act,
1964.</b> </p>

<p>- Much progress is being made in the pharmacological study of
cannabis and the active ingredient has been synthesised. It is
possible that synthetic pot will be available in large quantities
before long, and this substance is likely to be purer and safer,
and perhaps more potent, than the product obtained from the
plant. Such a substance would not be covered by the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1965, but the proposed legislation would make it
possible to add new products of the pharmacological industry to
the schedule of restricted drugs simply by regulations placed
before the two Houses of Parliament. </p>

<p><b>(12) Preparations of cannabis and its derivatives should
continue to be available on prescription for purposes of medical
treatment and research. Provision should be made in legislation
for records to be maintained so that the position can be kept
under review.</b> </p>

<p>- The committee did not want to hinder the few doctors who are
experimenting with the use of cannabis in the treatment of
disturbed adolescents, amphetamine dependence, alcoholism and
other conditions which are difficult medical problems. Although
there have been few indications of success in this treatment, it
is hoped that the new legislation will not interfere with these
experiments. In summary, the Wootton report found that most of
the fears about cannabis were groundless. Physically it is much
less dangerous than the other illegal drugs; most people can give
it up readily and without withdrawal symptoms. Most cannabis
users are industrious and law-abiding; there is no evidence that
in Britain it provokes the user to crime other than the crime of
possessing it. nor is there any evidence to support the widely
held belief that cannabis is a significant step in the escalation
to heroin. It was agreed that cannabis is a potent drug, like
alcohol, and that is was necessary to maintain restrictions on
its availability for the time being; these restrictions would
have to be more severe than they are for alcohol until more was
known about the long-term effects of the drug. Nevertheless it
was quite inappropriate to make cannabis subject to the same
penalties as heroin under the Dangerous Drugs Act and it was
wrong to send people to prison for the possession of a small
amount. Research has been hampered and the law should be changed
so as to encourage careful long-term investigations into the
effects of smoking cannabis. When these results are available,
the interim recommendations should be reviewed. These main
conclusions were not so very different from the results found in
earlier reports including the very thorough investigations made
in India and the city of New York, and the more recent studies
made in Canada and by the President's Commission in Washington.
But the publication of the Wootton report was greeted with a
chorus of abuse from politicians, press and the public.<br>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE </h2>

<h2>THE COMMISSION'S INTERPRETATION OF ITS TASK </h2>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Background of the Commission's Appointment </h3>

<p>1. The Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs
was appointed by the Government of Canada under Part I of the
Inquiries Act on May 29, 1969, on the recommendation of the
Honourable John Munro, Minister of National Health and Welfare. </p>

<p>The concern that gave rise to the appointment of the
Commission is described in Order-in-Council P.C. 1969-1112, which
authorized the appointment, in the following terms: </p>

<p>The Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a
report from the Minister of National Health and Welfare,
representing: </p>

<p>'That there is growing concern in Canada about the non-medical
use of certain drugs and substances, particularly, those having
sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing or hallucinogenic properties,
and the effect of such use on the individual and the social
implications thereof; </p>

<p>That within recent years, there has developed also the
practice of inhaling the fumes of certain solvents having an
hallucinogenic effect, and resulting in serious physical damage
and a number of deaths, such solvents being found in certain
household substances. Despite warnings and considerable
publicity, this practice has developed among young people and can
be said to be related to the use of drugs for other than medical
purposes; </p>

<p>That certain of these drugs and substances including lysergic
acid diethylamide, LSD, methamphetamines, commonly referred to as
'Speed', and certain others, have been made the subject of
controlling or prohibiting legislation under the Food and Drugs
Act, and cannabis, marijuana, has been a substance, the
possession of or trafficking in which has been prohibited under
the Narcotic Control Act; </p>

<p>That notwithstanding these measures and the competent
enforcement thereof by the R.C.M. Police and other enforcement
bodies, the incidence of possession and use of these substances
for non-medical purposes has increased and the need for an
investigation as to the cause of such increasing use has become
imperative. </p>

<p>During the year or so preceding the appointment of the
Commission, members of parliament had called for an inquiry into
the use of drugs. One member spoke of 'the galloping increase in
the use of marijuana and the increasing number of young people
tragically being paraded daily before the courts' and of 'the
extreme urgency of dealing properly with these cases'. In
announcing the Government's intention to appoint the Commission,
the Minister of National Health and Welfare spoke of 'the grave
concern felt by the Government at the expanding proportions of
the use of drugs and related substances for non-medical
purposes'. </p>

<h3>The Commission's Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>3. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of the
Commission sets out its terms of reference as follows; </p>

<p>That inquiry be made into and concerning the factors
underlying or relating to the non-medical use of the drugs and
substances above described and that for this purpose a Commission
of Inquiry be established, constituted and with authority as
hereinafter provided. </p>

<p>(a) to marshal from available sources, both in Canada and
abroad, data and information comprising the present fund of
knowledge concerning the non-medical use of sedative, stimulant,
tranquillizing, hallucinogenic and other psychotropic drugs or
substances; </p>

<p><i>(b) </i>to report on the current state of medical knowledge
respecting the effect of the drugs and substances referred to in
(a); </p>

<p><i>(c)</i> to inquire into and report on the motivation
underlying the non-medical use referred to in (a); </p>

<p><i>(d)</i> <i>to inquire into and report on the social,
economic, edu</i>cational and philosophical factors relating to
the use for non-medical purposes of the drugs and substances
referred to in (a) and in particular, on the extent of the
phenomenon, the social factors that had led to it, the age groups
involved, and problems of communication; and </p>

<p><i>(e)</i> <i>to inquire into and recommend with respect to
the ways </i>or means by which the Federal Government can act,
alone or in its relations with Government at other levels, in the
reduction of the dimensions of the problems involved in such use.
</p>

<h3>The Implications of the Terms of Reference </h3>

<p>4. While the Commission's terms of reference make specific
mention of the sedative, stimulant, tranquillizing and
hallucinogenic drugs, they also require inquiry concerning other
psychotropic drugs and substances. <i>The Commission understands
drug to mean any substance that by its chemical nature</i><b> </b><i>alters
structure or function in the living organism. The psychotropic
drugs are those drugs which alter sensation, mood, consciousness
or other psychological or behavioural functions. </i>These
concepts are further clarified in Chapter Two<b> </b>of this
report. A number of classifications of psychotropic drugs have
been brought to the Commission's attention. Chapter Two presents
the classification that has been accepted by the Commission. It
also contains a detailed account of the psychotropic properties
and medical and non-medical uses of certain of the drugs causing
the greatest public concern. It is clear to the Commission that
it would not be appropriate to confine its attention to the
so-called 'soft drugs' such as marijuana, hashish and LSD. The
'hard drugs' such as the opiate narcotics, of which heroin is an
example, have marked psychotropic effects. The amphetamines or
'speed' drugs which are popularly considered as hard drugs appear
to be increasing in their non-medical use. Moreover, both the
structure of present Canadian drug laws and the nature of the
drug controversy make it impossible to consider the 'soft drugs'
without reference to the amphetamines and the opiates. Indeed,
the opiate narcotics have been and are an important reference
point in, establishing the public perspective for the non-medical
use of many other drugs. The Commission believes that it has
properly focused its primary attention in the initial phase of
its inquiry on the non-medical use of drugs such as cannabis, LSD
and amphetamines by young people. However, we have had a growing
concern for the facts and implications of the use of drugs such
as alcohol and tobacco by people of all ages. These two drugs,
both of which are psychotropic, remain the most popular drugs in
non-medical use among both young people and adults. Adults
generally seem unwilling to accept the fact that alcohol and
tobacco are drugs, and often find it difficult to view the
non-medical drug use of youth with reference to and in the
context of the socially acceptable use of drugs by adults. </p>

<p>5. Two broad categories in which the use of psychotropic drugs
can be classified are: (a) medical and non-medical use, and (b)
legal and illegal use. While the distinction between legal and
illegal use is simple and derives directly from the law, it is
difficult to find a satisfactory definition of medical and
non-medical drug use. <i>Medical use of drugs is taken</i> <i>by
the Commission to be use which is indicated for generally
accepted medical reasons, whether under medical supervision or
not; all drug use which is not indicated on generally accepted
medical grounds is considered to be non-medical use. </i>Thus,
the occasional use of aspirin to control the pain of an ordinary
headache is considered to be medical use, while the dependent use
of large quantities of barbiturates obtained through one or more
prescriptions is not. Clearly, non-medical use is not to be
equated with illegal use. The use of alcohol by adults is
generally non-medical but it is legal, whereas the use of
marijuana is both non-medical and illegal. </p>

<p>6. The commission is invited to marshal the present fund of
world knowledge concerning the non-medical use of psychotropic
drugs and substances. Taken literally, this task is impossible,
with the time and resources available to the Commission. The
world literature on all the psychotropic drugs and substances is
very extensive. There are over 40,000 items on alcohol alone at
Rutgers University, a major centre of alcohol studies. There are
estimated to be over 2,000 items on cannabis. Experts in the
field have testified to the extreme difficulty of keeping abreast
of the literature, particularly because of its multi-disciplinary
character. There are only a few sources of comprehensive
information on this continent: the Addiction Research Foundation
of Ontario is by far the best equipped in this country; the
National Institute of Mental Health in the United States provides
a computerized data retrieval service. In Geneva, the World
Health Organization of the United Nations possesses extensive
bibliographical resources. </p>

<p>Collecting the available data and information is only one
stage. It is also necessary to establish and apply criteria of
scientific validity to such data and information. In many
instances, the Commission is obliged to rely heavily on the work
of experts who have themselves sifted and critically evaluated
the available literature. It must form its judgements on the
basis of the materials which they have identified as most
relevant and reliable. The Commission cannot carry out a
comprehensive bibliographical work for the whole range of
psychotropic drugs and substances. It must try to seize upon the
essentials in the present fund of knowledge as they bear upon the
areas of concern and the issues in this inquiry. </p>

<p>7. The Commission is required to report on the current state
of medical knowledge concerning the effect of psychotropic drugs
and substances. This it has attempted to do in an interim
fashion, in Chapter Two, entitled 'The Drugs and Their Effects'.
The effects contemplated by paragraph (b) in the terms of
reference are presumably the physiological and psychological
ones, including their behavioural manifestations. The term
'medical' is rather too narrow as a reference to the expertise
which is in the determination of drug effects since these are a
complex result of many factors, including the expectation of the
user and the social setting in which the drug is taken. In its
interim brief to the Commission, the Canadian Medical Association
stressed the multi-disciplinary character of the study required
for a proper understanding of non-medical drug use. We have,
therefore, interpreted the word 'medical' to refer broadly to all
scientific knowledge concerning the effects of drug use. The
language of paragraph (b) of the terms of reference suggests that
it was not intended that the Commission would itself undertake
original research into the effects of non-medical drug use.
Although we do not exclude the possibility of some clinical or
experimental work, particularly with respect to the effect of
certain drugs on psychomotor functions, it is our opinion that
with the time and resources at our disposal, and having regard to
the research currently being conducted by such organizations as
the Addiction Research Foundation and the National Institute of
Mental Health, we should confine ourselves to carrying out a
critical review of the existing knowledge and ongoing research,
as well as attempting to identify research priorities and the
role which the federal government can play in relation to
research. </p>

<p>8. The remaining paragraphs in the terms of reference deal
with the extent and the causes of non-medical drug use. They
reflect a broad concern to understand the reasons for the
increase in such use. They invite the Commission to attempt to
place this phenomenon in a proper social and philosophic context.
We cannot help feeling that this is one of the most important
aspects of our task: one on which there is a compelling need for
an understanding of current Canadian attitudes. This is implied
by the allusion in paragraph (d) of the terms of reference to
'problems of communication'. To understand the factors underlying
non-medical drug use and the problems for which government action
may be indicated, it is necessary to consider not only the
effects, extent, and causes of such use, but the range of social
response and attitude which such use has elicited from
government, other institutions and individuals. For non-medical
drug use and the social response to it are interacting and
mutually conditioning phenomena. </p>

<h3>Methods of Inquiry </h3>

<p>9. The Commission has used a variety of methods of inquiry.
Because of the profound social significance of the non-medical
drug use phenomenon and of the importance of personal and public
attitudes to it, the Commission decided early to conduct public
hearings in all of the provinces. It has attached particular
important to these hearings. They have been used to foster the
widest possible public discussion. In order to encourage the
participation of young people, it was decided to hold some of the
public hearings in more informal settings than may have been
customary for such commissions in the past. In addition to the
public hearings, the Commissioners have collectively and
individually held numerous private hearings, have consulted with
experts in several fields related to non-medical drug use, and
have read extensively in the scientific and legal literature. The
Commission has also received many communications, written and
oral, from Canadians in all walks of life. </p>

<p>10. At the beginning of September, 1969, the Commission wrote
to over 750 individuals and organizations inviting them to submit
briefs or to make oral submissions. In particular, the Commission
solicited briefs from: federal and provincial government
departments; law enforcement authorities, educational
institutions and associations; members of university faculties
and departments; medical and pharmaceutical institutions and
associations, addiction research foundations; street clinics and
other innovative services; correctional and welfare
organizations; bar associations; youth organizations; student
organizations; and a wide variety of other organizations and
individuals having an evident concern or point of contact with
the phenomenon of non-medical drug use in Canada. The Commission
received a gratifying response to this invitation, and despite
the relatively short time available in some cases for the
preparation of briefs, individuals and organizations made a very
commendable effort to prepare submissions for the public hearings
which began in the middle of October. </p>

<p>11. A list of the organizations and individuals who have been
identified with submissions to the Commission in the initial
phase of this inquiry is contained in Appendix A to this report,
Fifty-five organizations have been represented at the public
hearings at which they have submitted written briefs; twenty have
been represented by oral submissions; forty-five have made
written submissions to the Commission without appearing at a
public hearing. Thirty two individuals have submitted written
briefs and 45 others have made oral submissions at public
hearings. In addition, there have been numerous oral submissions
and interventions by members of the public who have attended the
hearings. The Commission has also received several hundred
letters from individuals, and a selection of these letters or
excerpts from them is included in the Report as Appendix B. We
emphasize that this selection is not intended to convey the
weight of opinion in this correspondence, but simply to reflect
something of the range of response. </p>

<p>12. In the initial phase of this inquiry, the Commission has
held public hearings in the following centres: Toronto - October
16, 17 and 18; Vancouver - October 30 and 31; Victoria - November
1; Montreal - November 6, 7 and 8; Winnipeg - November 13 and 14;
Ottawa - December 12 and 13; Halifax - January 29 and 30; St.
John's - January 31; Fredericton - February 19; Moncton -
February 20; Sackville - February 20; and Charlottetown -
February 21; Kingston - March 5. </p>

<p>A special word may be appropriate concerning the nature of the
public hearings. They have been conducted in a rather informal
manner. There has been a considerable degree of audience
participation. People have felt free to comment on formal
submissions, and there has been a great deal of informal exchange
among persons attending the hearings. On the whole, response to
this style of hearing has been favourable, although there has
been some criticism from one or two organizations who have
expressed the opinion that we should not have permitted questions
and critical comments from members of the public. Because of the
nature of the phenomenon which it is required to investigate, the
Commission is convinced that it has been essential to attempt to
establish a true public forum for discussion<i> </i>of the
issues. Most organizations have reacted favourably to this kind
of inquiry. In addition to the more traditional settings of
hotels and public buildings, the Commission has held public
hearings at universities and from time to time in coffee houses
that have become centres of the new youth culture. </p>

<p>Informal hearings have been held in the following
universities: York University; the University of Toronto; the
University of British Columbia; the University of Montreal;
McGill University; Sir George Williams University; the University
of Manitoba; the University of Winnipeg; the University of
Ottawa; Carleton University; Dalhousie University; Memorial
University; the University of New Brunswick; the University of
Moncton; Mount Allison University; the University of Prince
Edward Island; and in the following coffee houses: 'The Penny
Farthing' in Yorkville, Toronto; 'The Bistro' in Vancouver, and
the 'Back Door' in Montreal. </p>

<p>The hearings in these more informal settings have given the
Commission direct and vivid contact with the opinions and
attitudes of young people in Canada. All the Commission hearings
have been recorded on tape, and in addition there has been a
stenographic record. In many ways it is a matter of regret that
an audio-visual record could not have been made, but the nature
of the subject matter is such that the Commission felt obliged to
protect individuals appearing before it from undue publicity. The
media have cooperated with the Commission in respecting its
request that members of the public should not be photographed
while making submissions. In many cases, the submissions have
been of a highly personal nature, and the hearings would have
been much inhibited if they had been photographed. At the same
time, the Commission has been intensely aware of the fact that it
was listening to an unusual social commentary. Opinions and
feelings have poured forth in the hearings with great
spontaneity, particularly in the more informal settings. The
Commission has been deeply impressed, and on several occasions,
moved by the testimony which it has heard. It has been struck by
the depth of feeling which this phenomenon and the social
response to it have aroused. As a result of the initial phase of
its inquiry, the Commission is more than ever convinced that the
proper response to the non-medical use of psychotropic drugs is a
question which must be worked out by the people of Canada,
examining it and talking it over together. It goes to the roots
of our society and touches the values underlying our whole
approach to life. It is not a matter which can be confined to the
discrete consultation of experts, although experts obviously have
their role, and a very important one, to play. </p>

<p>13. A word should be said about the protection of witnesses.
The terms of reference of the Commission empower it to take
testimony in such manner as to safeguard the anonymity of
witnesses. The Order-in-Council authorizing the appointment of
the Commission provides: </p>

<p>That the said Commissioners may, if they deem the same
expedient, cause a record to be made of the evidence which shall
be given or produced before them, or any part of that evidence,
as to the matters to be inquired into and reported upon and may
direct that the oral evidence of witnesses, before them, or any
such witness, shall be taken in shorthand by a shorthand writer,
approved and sworn by the said Commissioners or one of them, and
may direct that the oral evidence of any such witness may be so
given and recorded, whether under oath or otherwise, without a
disclosure of the identity of that witness, and that any evidence
so recorded shall be certified by the person or persons taking
the same in shorthand, as correct. </p>

<p>The notices which the Commission has published of its hearings
have given prominence to this readiness to take evidence given
privately and anonymously, and many witnesses have availed
themselves of this opportunity. The Commission has also received
a number of anonymous submissions through the mail. At the same
time, concern has been expressed from time to time that the
public hearings might be used for law enforcement purposes. As a
result of an understanding at the outset of this inquiry with the
officers of the R.C.M.P., the Commission has been able to assure
the public that its hearings would not be exploited for law
enforcement purposes. It has every reason to believe that this
understanding has been respected. Although there have been
rumours from time to time that law enforcement personnel have
taken advantage of the hearings for purposes of investigation, no
evidence of this has been brought to the attention of the
Commission, despite public statements by the Chairman that any
such instances should be reported to him. </p>

<p>The Commission has been very impressed by the candour with
which people of all ages have come forward and spoken from a
depth of conviction, and feeling about the phenomenon of
non-medical drug usage and its relation to other aspects of
social and cultural change today. </p>

<p>14. Altogether, it is estimated that nearly 12,000 Canadians
have attended the hearings up to the end of February. The
Commissioners have travelled some 17,000 miles, and in the months
ahead they will continue to move back and forth across the
country until every province and major city have been visited, as
well as many of the smaller communities. </p>

<p>15. The Commission has had the benefit of a wide range of
advice from experts in the field of non-medical drug use. It is
only possible here to mention some of those who were particularly
helpful. </p>

<p>The Commission has had several sessions with officers of the
R.C.M.P, and has received the fullest cooperation from the Force
in its attempt to understand the lessons of law enforcement in
this field. In addition to the public submission of the Force,
each Division prepared a brief, and the Commission has had the
advantage of private hearings with officers from each Division.
Moreover, research consultants of the Commission have been
permitted to observe law enforcement by the Force at first hand.
The Commission has also received a number of written
communications from the Force in addition to its formal
submissions. We can not speak too highly of the cooperation that
we have received from the R.C.M.P., who went to particular
trouble, on relatively short notice in the initial stages of the
inquiry, to give the Commission the benefit of their experience.
Whatever view one may take of law enforcement policy in this
controversial field, we feel obliged to record our respect for
the highly professional manner in which the R.C.M.P. have sought
to per-form their duty in relation to this inquiry. We look
forward to their continued cooperation as we deepen our study of
the problems of law enforcement and the administration of justice
in the field of non-medical drug use. </p>

<p>The Commission has also received a great deal of valuable
assistance from addiction foundations, notably the Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario, the Narcotic Addiction Foundation
of British Columbia, and OPTAT (Office de la Prevention et du
Traitement de l'Alcoolisme et des Autres Toxicomanies). From the
outset of its inquiry the Commission has had the benefit of
frequent consultation with members of the Ontario Foundation, and
the Commission's research staff have made extensive use of the
bibliographical and documentary resources of the Foundation. </p>

<p>The Commission has also consulted with many other experts, in
Canada and the United States. It plans to consult with many more,
including experts outside North America, in the ensuing year. For
the present, it would like to make special mention of the
assistance which it has received from Dr J. Robertson Unwin, Dr
Lionel Solursh and Mr Wilfred Clement, whose intimate knowledge
of the Canadian drug scene from a scientific, yet deeply human
perspective, has made their observations and advice invaluable.
The Commission should also record its indebtedness for advice
received in the early stages of the inquiry from Dr Helen Nowlis
of the University of Rochester, Samuel Pearlman of the City
University of New York, Dr Daniel Glaser of the New York State
Narcotic Addiction Control Commission; members of the National
Institute of Mental Health, and Department of Justice in the
United States. </p>

<h3>The Role of the Interim Report </h3>

<p>16. We have had some difficulty in determining what should be
the role of our interim report. In particular, we have been
somewhat perplexed as to how far we are justified in coming to
conclusions and making recommendations at this time. But we are
required by our terms of reference to render an interim report,
and we assume that something more is expected than a simple
report of progress. We believe that what is expected, at the very
least, is a report, which conveys our initial understanding of
the subject matter of the inquiry and makes such recommendations
as we feel are urgent and for which we believe we have a
sufficient basis at this time. We hope it will serve to put the
phenomenon of non-medical drug use in some perspective, to
identify the issues, and to provide the basis for further
consideration and discussion by the people of Canada. Further, by
identifying certain attitudes, hypotheses, and tentative
opinions, the interim report will serve, we hope, as a sounding
board, eliciting further evidence and opinion, and indicating to
us wherein our definition of the issues and our preliminary
opinions may require revision. </p>

<p>17. The function of the final report will be to complete the
picture begun by the interim report and to report upon the system
of social response which we recommend for the phenomenon of
non-medical drug use. The inquiry between the interim report and
the final report will test the definitions of issues and the
hypotheses reflected in the interim report, add necessary
information with respect to the effects, the extent, and the
causes of non-medical drug use, as well as the role played by the
various aspects of social control and response, and lay the
foundation for specific recommendations concerning these various
aspects. The interim report is primarily concerned with a
statement of the issues and applicable principles, and the final
report is to be concerned with the detailed application of these
principles to the development of a satisfactory system of social
response. </p>

<p>We recognize, however, that the urgency of some of the
problems involved in non-medical drug use and the time required
to develop adequate resources to cope with them may indicate the
appropriateness of certain recommendations at this time. This is
particularly true with respect to preparations and organization
for which considerable lead time is required. In such cases it
may be sufficient to indicate the general direction which certain
responses should take, leaving it to further study and
consultation in the ensuing year to settle matters of detail. </p>

<p>18. Chapter Two on the effect of the drugs is offered at this
time for two reasons. First, we have been profoundly impressed by
repeated assertions of the need for more reliable information,
and we hope that this chapter will serve a useful purpose as
material for drug education. Secondly, we feel that it is an
indispensable basis for the development of public understanding
of the issues. In effect, in Chapter Two we disclose our initial
assumptions concerning the effects of the drugs. Our </p>

<p>object is to identify the body of reliable and generally<b> </b>accepted
knowledge, and to determine where the important uncertainties and
gaps exist. We certainly concur in the impression which others
have conveyed of a field of knowledge bedevilled by controversy,
conflicting professional opinion, and uncertainty. Some observers
question whether it is possible, in view of the intense feelings
on this subject, ever to come to agreement on what should be
accepted as scientifically known. Erich Goode in his article,
'Marijuana and the Politics of Reality', observes that 'the
multitude of results from the many marijuana reports forms a sea
of ambiguity into which nearly any message may be read'. He makes
the point that whether a particular drug effect is good or bad
depends on one's subjective point of view - the implications of
the effect in term's of one's own system of values. Goode sees no
possible reconciliation of these <i>'</i>differential evaluations<i>
</i>of the same &quot;objective&quot; consequences', and he
concludes that 'the essential meaning of the marijuana issue is
the meaning which each individual brings to it'. The Addiction
Research Foundation of Ontario makes the same point in its
preliminary submission to the Commission. It puts the matter this
way: </p>

<p>However, after all possible information has been acquired and
verified scientifically, the final steps in the formulation of
legislation or governmental policy will be based upon value
judgements. Even the classification of the effects of drug use as
'beneficial' or 'adverse' is a process of evaluation with respect
to subjective standards. </p>

<p>The response to non-medical drug use is profoundly a matter of
attitudes. At the same time we must make every effort to
ascertain what should be accepted as scientific knowledge of the
'objective' effects. It is intolerable that the process of
subjective evaluation should take place in ignorance of the
objective facts. At the same, we would do well to heed Goode's
caution that there is an inevitable tendency to select and
emphasize those views of 'objective' facts which support our own
subjective evaluation. And as Goode points out, with special
reference to the La Guardia Report on marijuana, the various
findings can be used to support conflicting points of view. Are
we to conclude that the task is hopeless? We think not. We can
certainly make progress by attempting to identify what should be
accepted scientifically concerning the 'objective' effects, by
pointing out the important areas of scientific controversy or<b> </b>lack
of scientific knowledge, and by making explicit the value
judgements underlying the conflicting views as to how the effects
should be subjectively characterized. We believe it is helpful to
clarify the issues of the debate. </p>

<h3>Staff and Research </h3>

<p>19. The members of the Commission and their staff are listed
in Appendix C. The Commission is carrying out its task with a
small nucleus of full-time staff and with research consultants on
a part-time basis for special aspects of its study. The
Commission's Research Associates, Dr Charles Farmilo and Dr Ralph
D. Miller, are concentrating on<b> </b>psychopharmacological
research into the effects of the drugs. Dr Miller is the author,
with the assistance of Dr Farmilo, of Chapter Two on 'The Drugs
and Their Effects'. Research that has been commissioned so far
includes survey research to determine the extent and patterns of
non-medical drug use in Canada, as well as Canadian perceptions
of and attitudes towards this phenomenon, and legal studies, both
doctrinal and empirical, of the various problems involved in the
regulation of non-medical drug use. The section of Chapter Five
dealing with the law is based in part on preliminary work by
Professor Paul Weiler and John Hogarth. </p>

<p>Research is only part of the work that is involved in an
inquiry of this kind. Special mention should be made of the
administrative staff who have had to work under particular
pressure because of the requirement of an interim report,
impinging concurrently with the organization and conduct of the
public hearings. We would like to express our appreciation of the
work of Mr James J. Moore, Executive-Secretary of the Commission,
who has had the general direction of operations and who has also
participated in the writing of the report; Mr Jack Macbeth, who
has been of great assistance in the organization of hearings and
the preparation of the report; Mrs Vivian Luscombe who has
supervised the secretarial staff of the Commission; Mr C. William
Doylend, the Ottawa Office Manager, and other members of the
administrative, secretarial and research staff. <br>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO : THE DRUGS AND THEIR EFFECTS </h2>

<p>INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>20. The primary purpose of this chapter is to review in
preliminary fashion the current scientific knowledge of certain
psychotropic drugs used non-medically in Canada. In addition,
this section will introduce a few basic concepts which may be
helpful to the understanding of some of the potentials and
limitations of the scientific method as applied to the study of
human behaviour and drugs.* Psychopharmacology, the branch of
science specifically concerned with these issues, can be defined
as the study of the interaction of drugs with ongoing
psychological and behavioural activity. </p>

<p>A certain amount of the current controversy and lack of
communication regarding the 'drug problem' has been attributed to
the multitude of meanings that the term 'drug' has to different
people, and to the often arbitrary way in which our society
defines, and endeavours to solve, the problems arising from man's
persistent use of chemical substances to alter his existence. To
some people the word 'drug' means a medicine used in the
prevention, diagnosis, of treatment of an abnormal or
pathological condition. In other situations, it is often used to
refer only to illegal or socially disapproved substances. Some
individuals employ the word in a manner suggesting dependence or
addiction, regardless of whether it refers to some chemical
substance or to other preoccupations such as television, music,
books, or sports and games. Some consider alcohol, tea and coffee
as drugs, while to others these are simply normal beverages not
to be confused with the more foreign and unfamiliar substances
viewed as drugs. Furthermore, the terms 'drug' and 'narcotic' are
given special meanings in legal areas. </p>

<p>* A glossary of technical terms, as used in this report, is
presented at the end of this volume. </p>

<p>Even scientists frequently disagree as to the precise
definition of the term 'drug'. </p>

<p>Modell164 has suggested a comprehensive pharmacological
definition of drugs which the Commission has adopted. As noted in
Chapter One, a <i>drug </i>is considered to be any <i>substance
that by its chemical nature alters structure or function in the
living organism. </i>Modell observed that: </p>

<p>Drug action is therefore a general biological phenomenon ...
pharmacologic effects are exerted by foods, vitamins, hormones,
microbial metabolites, plants, snake venoms, stings, products of
decay, air pollutants, pesticides, minerals, synthetic chemicals,
virtually all foreign materials (very few are completely inert)
and many materials normally in the body. </p>

<p>While this interpretation may be too broad for certain
practical purposes, it provides some perspective into the
ubiquitous nature of our internal and external chemical
environment, and the complexity of the question of human drug
use. The Commission's primary concern is focused on the use and
effects of drugs taken for their <i>psychotropic or psychoactive </i>properties
as defined by their capacity to <i>alter sensation, mood,
consciousness or other psychological or behavioural functions.</i>
</p>

<p>21. The use of psychoactive drugs seems to be an almost
universal phenomenon and has apparently occurred throughout
recorded history, in almost all societies. Some scholars have
suggested that this use of drugs may have been among the earliest
behavioural characteristics distinguishing man from the other
animals. Blum, in the United States <i>Task Force Report </i>(1967),
has stated:27 </p>

<p>Mind-altering drug use is common to mankind. Such drugs have
been employed for millennia in almost all cultures. In our work
we have been able to identify only a few societies in the world
today where no mind-altering drugs are used; these are small and
isolated cultures. Our own society puts great stress on
mind-altering drugs as desirable products which are used in many
acceptable ways (under medical supervision, as part of the family
home remedies, in self-medication, in social use [alcohol, tea
parties, coffee klatches, etc.] and in private use [cigarettes,
etc.] ). In terms of drug use, 'the rarest or most abnormal form
of behaviour is not to take any mind-altering drugs at all.... If
one is to use the term 'drug user', it applies to nearly all of
us. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Role of Science </h3>

<p>22. It has been suggested that the potential role of science
in the solution of the 'drug problem' is to provide information
to better enable individuals and society to make informed and
discriminating decisions regarding the availability and use of
particular drugs. Unfortunately, considerable disparity often
exists between the need for such information and the capacity of
science to acquire and communicate it. </p>

<p>Helen Nowlis has noted: 172 </p>

<p>There are many reasons why the 'facts' invoked in
non-scientific discussions of drugs are often not facts at all.
They may be second or third-hand quotations of statements
attributed to scientists. There is a readiness on the part of
many to accept as 'scientific fact' any statement made by, or
attributed to, someone labelled as scientist, whether it is a
statement based on research, on uncontrolled observation, or
merely on personal opinion. </p>

<p>While science may be able to serve as a useful guideline and
source of information, science itself is not a policy-making
process, but merely a practical system designed to explore and
test notions of a certain abstract nature. Even though the aim of
science is to maximize objectivity, the interpretation and
application of scientific data is usually a subjective venture
regardless of the controls maintained in the formal analyses. The
practical use of such information in the social sphere often
entails economic, legal, philosophical and moral issues which are
not amenable to scientific analysis as we know it today. </p>

<p>Even though considerable progress has been made in advancing
our knowledge of biology, science has provided only a minimal
understanding of the essential nature of psychological and
behavioural functions and their relationship to underlying
physiological processes. Consequently, psychopharmacology today
must be content with exploring the interaction of chemicals
(often with certain identified physical characteristics) with a
largely unknown largely unknown human psychobiological system of
enormous complexity. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Classification of Drugs </h3>

<p>23. Drug classifications, based on a variety of different
considerations have been developed and there appears to be little
general agreement as to the optimal scheme for ordering the
universe of biologically active substances. For example, drugs
might be organized according to chemical structure,
clinical-therapeutic use, potential health hazards, liability to
non-medical use, public availability and legality, effects on
specific neural or other physiological systems, or influence on
certain psychological and behavioural processes. The
classification systems developed from these different approaches
may show considerable overlap, although there are often striking
incongruities. For example, some drugs which appear very similar
in chemical structure may be quite different in pharmacological
activity and vice-versa. The most useful organization depends on
the intended use of the classifications. </p>

<p>Since our major concern here is with the effects of
psychologically active substances, our interim drug
classification system is based primarily on general psychological
and pharmacological considerations. In Table I eight major
classes are presented along with some examples of drugs from each
group. While the categories are not considered to be exhaustive,
the general system is applicable to the majority of drugs used
for their psychological effects. Since the effects of drugs
depend on a vast number of psychological and physiological
components, many of which seem unpredictable, these categories
are to some extent based on a typical reaction by an average
subject to a common dose. Large variations in any of various
factors can greatly alter the effects and may reduce the
reliability of the descriptions. </p>

<p>24. The <i>sedatives</i> and <i>hypnotics</i> (e.g., alcohol,
barbiturates, 'sleeping pills' and minor tranquillizers)
generally decrease central nervous system (CNS) arousal (although
some psychological stimulation may result at low doses). Most of
these drugs are used medically to reduce anxiety and tension, to
produce general sedation and, at higher doses, sleep. The
anticholinergic substances (e.g., belladonna alkaloids) are often
used as sedatives at low doses although larger amounts may
produce excitation and delirium. </p>

<p>25. The <i>stimulants </i>(e.g., amphetamines or 'speed',
'diet' and 'pep pills', caffeine, and cocaine) generally suppress
appetite, increase activity, alertness, tension and general CNS
arousal, and, at higher doses, block sleep. Tobacco (nicotine and
coal tars) is usually considered a physiological stimulant
although a variety of other effects are not uncommon. </p>

<p>26. The third group includes drugs described as <i>psychedelic
</i>(mind-manifesting), <i>hallucinogenic </i>(hallucination-producing),
<i>psychotomimetic </i>(psychosis-imitating), <i>illusinogenic </i>(illusion-producing),
and <i>psychodysleptic </i>(mind-disrupting). While these terms
refer to somewhat overlapping effects alleged to occur with the
drugs in this class, the various labels emphasize different
characteristics which are neither synonymous nor necessarily
mutually exclusive. Probably none are entirely adequate as
descriptive terms. These drugs may produce profound alteration in
sensation, mood and consciousness at doses which result in
comparatively light physiological activity . LSD and marijuana
are examples from this group. The medical value of these drugs is
the subject of considerable current controversy. </p>

<p>27. The drugs in the fourth category have, traditionally been
referred to as narcotics or opiates, and are derivatives of, or
pharmacologically related to, products of the opium plant. The
best known examples are heroin, morphine and codeine. The word
'narcotic' has been used inconsistently in scientific as well as
lay language and has been the subject of considerable
disagreement in legal matters (for example, marijuana, cocaine,
and other non-opiates are frequently controlled under laws
regulating narcotics, in spite of the fact that they are
pharmacologically different from this group). The use of the term
'opiates' is generally more specific, although its application
has not always been limited to these drugs. Consequently, the
specific term <i>opiate narcotics </i>is suggested to reduce
ambiguity. These drugs are used medically mainly for their
pain-relieving effects. </p>

<p>28. The fifth group is an aggregate of chemically diverse
substances perhaps best described on a physical basis as <i>volatile
solvents. </i>They are usually inhaled and include the vapour of
such common materials as glue, gasoline and lacquer thinner. Some
of these drugs have been called <i>deliriants </i>although
delirium is only one of many potential effects and is clearly not
restricted to these substances. Many are quite similar in effect
to the sedative group and might be considered in a sub-class of
that category. Others may have slight psychedelic or
hallucinogenic effects. Most of these substances have no known
medical use although several have been employed as clinical
anaesthetics. </p>

<p>29. The <i>non-narcotic analgesics </i>(e.g., Aspirin* and
Phenacetin*) are primarily used to reduce aching pain and to
lower fever. In some instances they may also serve as mild
sedatives. </p>

<p>30. The <i>clinical anti-depressants </i>(e.g., Tofranil* and
Nardil*) are used medically to improve mood in severely depressed
patients. These drugs are rarely used for non-medical purposes
since they have little effect on normal mood states. </p>

<p>31. The final group, the <i>major tranquillizers, </i>are
primarily used to reduce the symptoms of severe psychosis (e.g.,
schizophrenia). Largactil* and reserpine are examples. While
these have initiated a widespread revolution in chemo-therapy in
psychiatry, they are rarely involved in non-medical use. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Considerations </h3>

<p>32. The general effect of most drugs is greatly influenced by
a variety of psychological and environmental factors. Unique
qualities of an individual's personality, his past history of
drug experience, his attitudes towards the drug, his expectations
of its effects and his motivation for taking it are extremely
important and in some instances may completely obscure the
typical pharmacological response to a drug. These factors are
often referred to collectively as the person's mental 'set'. 'The
'setting' or total environment in which the drug is taken may
also be a factor of major significance. </p>

<p>A few drinks of alcohol may produce drowsiness and fatigue in
some situations, while the same individual under different
circumstances may be psychologically stimulated and aroused by
the same dose. It appears that the set and setting may be of
greater significance with the psychedelic-hallucinogenic
substances than with the other drugs, and it has been suggested
that psychological factors may often be the primary components in
determining the quality or character of the psychedelic drug
experience. </p>

<p>The so-called <i>placebo effect </i>is a striking example of
the importance of set and setting in determining the drug
response. A placebo, in this context, refers to a
pharmacologically inactive substance which elicits a significant
reaction, entirely because of what the individual expects or
desires to happen. In certain individuals in some settings a
placebo substance may have surprisingly powerful consequences.
The placebo effect is specific to the individual and the setting,
and not to any chemical properties of the substance involved.
Therefore, in spite of an apparent 'drug effect', the placebo is
not considered a drug since it does not alter function 'by its
chemical nature'. </p>

<p>Placebos have been reported in therapeutic situations to
significantly relieve such symptoms as headache and a variety of
other pains, hay fever, colds, seasickness, neuroses, and a
number of gastrointestinal complaints.97 Some scientists have
suggested that the bulk of medical history may actually have been
a history of the placebo, since many 'effective cures' of the
past have been shown to be without relevant direct
pharmacological action, and are today of no value as therapeutic
agents. </p>

<p>To control for the influence of such psychological factors in
drug research, testing is usually done under at least two
conditions: an assessment is made using the actual drug of
interest, and a separate measurement is taken after a placebo is
given under identical circumstances. By comparing these two
conditions some of the effects of set and setting can often be
controlled and the actual drug effect uncovered. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Pharmacological
Considerations </h3>

<p>33. In studying how drugs affect the body, pharmacologists
generally divide the analysis into several processes: </p>

<p>1. <i>Administration: </i>how does the drug enter the body? </p>

<p>2. <i>Absorption: </i>how does the drug get from the site of
administration into the physiological system of the body? </p>

<p>3. <i>Distribution: </i>how is the drug distributed to various
areas in the body? </p>

<p>4. <i>Action: </i>how and where does the drug produce what
effects? </p>

<p><i>5.</i> <i>Physiological Fate: </i>how is the drug
inactivated, metabolized, and/or eliminated from the body? </p>

<p>Different routes or modes of administration can have
considerable influence on the latency, duration, intensity and
the general nature of the drug effect. Many drugs are well
absorbed from the stomach and intestines after ingestion while
others are poorly taken up or may be destroyed by the gastric
juices. Certain drugs may be injected, with a hypodermic syringe
for example, just under the skin (subcutaneous or S.C,), into the
muscle (intramuscular or I.M.), or into a blood vein (intravenous
or I.V.). The effects are generally most rapid and intense after
intravenous injection and, consequently, this mode of
administration can be quite dangerous in inexperienced hands. In
addition, certain volatile substances can be rapidly and
efficiently absorbed from the lungs by inhalation. </p>

<p>34. The action of a drug is in many cases terminated by
chemical changes which it undergoes in the body, Certain organs
(often the liver) metabolize or 'break down' the original
substance into other chemicals which are usually (but not always)
less active and more easily eliminated from the body. Some drugs
may be excreted unchanged in the urine, faeces, or breath. Action
is not always terminated by excretion, however, and the effects
of some drugs greatly outlast the actual presence of the chemical
in the body. Numerous physiological factors alter absorption,
distribution, action and fate, and must therefore be taken into
consideration in the study of drug effects. </p>

<p>The details of cellular physiology are largely unknown and
with rare exceptions there is little information as to the
mechanism by which any particular drug changes the activity of
the nervous system. At the simplest level, it appears that a drug
alters the functioning of the living cell by entering into some
sort of chemical combination with substances already present.
Even if this molecular process were well understood, it would not
provide a straightforward basis for predicting the overall
effects of the drug on a group of interacting cells, or, at
higher level, on the total nervous system (comprising billions of
cells) and associated psychological and behavioural processes. </p>

<p><i>35. The importance of dose. </i>One of the basic principles
of pharmacology is that specific statements about drug effects
can not be made without consideration of the quantity or dose of
the drug involved. With all drugs, the response differs both in
the intensity and the character of the reaction, according to the
amount of the drug administered. The relation between the dose
and the intensity of an effect is often referred to by scientists
as the <i>dose-response or dose-effect relationship.</i> </p>

<p>Although the magnitude of the effects of some drugs may
increase in a rather uniform (monotonic) fashion as dose is
increased, other drugs, particularly the sedatives, may show a <i>bi-phasic
response </i>and actually produce behaviourally opposite effects
at some doses compared to others. Low doses of alcohol may, in
certain instances, be somewhat stimulating, while higher doses
generally have a strong sedating effect. Scopolamine (a
belladonna alkaloid) may produce sedation at low doses, and
excitation, delirium and hallucinations with larger quantities.
Very toxic doses of this drug can again produce sedation, coma
and even death. </p>

<p>For every drug there is a dose low enough so as to produce<b> </b>no
noticeable reaction, and at the opposite extreme, some degree of
toxicity or poisoning can be produced by any substance if enough
is taken. The concept of a poison, in fact, really refers to the
quantity of a drug which exceeds the body's capacity to cope with
it without damage. No drug can be designated either safe,
beneficial, or harmful without consideration of the dose likely
to be consumed. Chlorine, for example, which is present in most
urban drinking water in concentration so low as to have little or
no pharmacological effect on humans, is intended to poison
harmful bacteria. The same substance, highly concentrated in
gaseous form, was developed during World War I as an extremely
potent respiratory poison. Even the concept of a psychotropic
drug implies some notion of the range of doses likely to be
consumed, since almost any drug can, in high quantities, affect
psychological function. In many instances, however, considerable
physical toxicity or poisoning develops before significant
psychological effects occur. </p>

<p>It is usually essential to study a drug's effect over a range
of doses in order to obtain an adequate understanding of the
nature of the response. It is also important to consider doses
which have some relevance to existing or potential patterns of
use if social implications are to be inferred from experimental
findings. </p>

<p><i>36. The importance of time. </i>Another important
pharmacological concept is the <i>time-response relationship </i>or
the relation between the time which has elapsed since
administration and the effect produced. Such a temporal analysis
may be restricted to immediate or short-term (acute) effects of a
single dose, or on the other extreme, may involve the long-term
effects of persistently repeated (chronic) use of a drug. </p>

<p>The intensity and often the character or quality of the
overall drug effect may change substantially within a short
period of time. For example, the main intoxicating effects of a
large dose of alcohol generally reach a peak in less than an
hour, then gradually taper off. An initially stimulating effect
may later change to one of sedation. With some drugs, an initial
state of tension or anxiety may later turn into one of relaxation
and sense of well-being, or vice-versa, as a function of time. </p>

<p>It may also be important with some drugs to consider the
long-term consequences of chronic use. Usually such effects can
not be readily predicted from what is known of the immediate
response. For instance, while there is little doubt that the
smoking of a few tobacco cigarettes has no lasting detrimental
effect on lung or cardiac function, there is increasing
scientific evidence that long-term heavy use of this substance
has serious consequences. As another example, the clinical
picture of the chronic alcoholic involves psychological and
physiological disturbances which do not develop with moderate
drinking. In simple terms, it is essential to ask: 'How much?';
'How often?'; and 'For how long?' (as well as 'By whom?') when
discussing the long-term reaction to repeated drug use. </p>

<p>37. <i>Main effects and side effects. </i>It is highly
unlikely that any drug has only a single action on a particular
behavioural or physiological function. Most drugs can produce an
almost unlimited number of effects on the body, each with a
somewhat unique dose-response and time-response relationship. The
relative strength of the different responses to a drug generally
varies with the amount taken, and a particular effect which is
prominent at one dosage level may be quite secondary at another. </p>

<p>In a therapeutic or clinical setting, one is usually
interested in a single or perhaps a small number of the many
possible effects. Those which are desired are generally
considered 'main effects' whilst the other unwanted but
concurrent drug responses are labelled 'side effects'. This
distinction between main and side effects is a relative one and
depends on the purpose or the anticipated use of the drug. A
response which is considered unnecessary or undesirable in one
application may, in fact, be the main or desired effect in
another. For example, in the clinical treatment of severe pain,
the analgesic (pain-reducing) properties of morphine are
considered the main effect, and the psychological euphoria and
the intestinal constipation also produced are undesirable side
effects. To the 'street addict', however, the euphoric properties
are the main effects, and the analgesic and constipating effects
may be irrelevant or undesired. Certain opiate compounds such as
paregoric are used in treatment of diarrhoea and, in this
instance, the constipating effect of the drug is desired and the
other responses are considered side effects. It is universal that
drugs have undesirable and toxic side effects if the dose is
sufficiently increased. </p>

<p><i>38. Drug interaction. </i>Even in cases where the
individual effects of different drugs are well known and
reliable, if several substances are taken at the same time, tile
interaction may produce a response which is quite unpredictable
on the basis of the knowledge of the individual drugs alone. Less
commonly, a particular interaction effect may be anticipated. If
the drugs normally have similar properties, they may often have
an additive effect if taken together, resulting in a general
increase in responses similar to that produced by a larger single
dose of either one. There are also instances in which one drug
may potentiate the action of another, and the two together
produce a greater effect than would be expected by merely adding
the individual reactions. Furthermore, some drugs have
antagonistic effects, and one may counteract or inhibit certain
normal responses to the other. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>38a<i>. Tolerance is said to develop when the response to the
same dose of a drug decreases with repeated use. </i>With most
tolerance-producing drugs, effects of original intensity can be
retained. to a certain extent, if the dose is increased. The
extent of tolerance, and the rate at which it is acquired, depend
on the drug, the individual using it, and the magnitude and
frequency of administration. The body does not lose sensitivity
to all aspects of the reaction to a particular drug with equal
rapidity, or to the same degree. Some of the effects of a drug
may 'drop out' sooner than others with repeated use. Tolerance to
the effects which are reinforcing or rewarding drug use (i.e.,
'main effects') is usually reflected by a tendency for users to
increase dose. Most aspects of tolerance dissipate with
abstinence from the drug. </p>

<p>A moderate degree of tolerance to most effects of alcohol and
barbiturates develops and a heavy drinker may be able to consume
two to three times the alcohol tolerated by a novice. Little
tolerance develops to the lethal toxicity of these drugs,
however, and a heavy user of sedatives is just as susceptible to
death by overdose as is a non-tolerant individual. Opiate
narcotics, such as morphine, are capable of producing profound
tolerance, and heavy users have been known to take up to ten
times the amount which would normally produce death. By contrast,
no noticeable tolerance develops to cocaine (a short-acting
stimulant). </p>

<p>The exact mechanisms by which the body adapts, or becomes
tolerant, to different drug effects are not completely
understood, although several processes have been suggested.
Certain drugs (e.g., barbiturates) stimulate the body's
production of the metabolic enzymes which inactivate them. In
addition, there is evidence that a considerable degree of central
nervous system (CNS) tolerance may develop to certain drugs
independent of changes in the rate of absorption, metabolism or
excretion. An individual tolerant to alcohol, for example, can be
relatively unaffected by a large dose even though the resulting
high level of alcohol in his blood may accurately reflect the
magnitude of his intake. It is uncertain as to whether this
represents some general molecular adaptation to the drug at the
level of the individual nerve cell, or perhaps a specific
response by the central nervous system to counteract the sedating
effects and maintain normal function. Learning factors often
appear to play an important role in changing the individual's
response to a drug after experience with it. Effects which
initially may be strange or frightening may later be accepted
without reaction or concern, or perhaps, even be desired. There
is evidence that people may learn to control some drug effects,
or otherwise come to function normally in the presence of certain
responses which might originally have been distracting, or
otherwise disrupting of behaviour. </p>

<p>A phenomenon often referred to as 'reverse tolerance' has been
noted with some drugs (notably the psychedelics) in which the
desired effects may be achieved with smaller doses after
experience with the drug. Both learning and pharmacological
mechanisms have been suggested to underly this process. </p>

<p>In many instances, after an individual becomes tolerant to the
effects of one drug, he will also show tolerance to others with
similar action. This is called <i>cross-tolerance. </i>For
example, a heavy drinker will normally show a reduced response to
barbiturates, tranquillizers and anaesthetics, as well as to
alcohol. </p>

<p>39.<i> Physical dependence is a physiological state of
adaptation to a</i><b> </b><i>drug, normally following the
development of tolerance, which results in a characteristic set
of withdrawal symptoms (often called the 'abstinence syndrome'),
when administration of the drug is stopped. </i>These symptoms
may be of an intense nature after persistent heavy use, and with
some sedatives and opiate narcotics, may include tremors,
vomiting, delirium, cramps and, in severe cases with some drugs,
convulsions and death. There are generally no overt signs of
physical dependence if the drug level is kept high enough to
avoid the withdrawal syndrome. In a sense, the body comes to
depend on the drug for 'normal' functioning after adapting to its
presence, and when the drug is absent, considerable disruption of
essential physiological processes occurs until readjustment
develops. The withdrawal syndrome may also he elicited without
abstinence, by the administration of a substance which
specifically antagonizes or blocks certain effects of the
original drug. </p>

<p>Withdrawal symptoms can be prevented or promptly relieved by
the administration of a sufficient quantity of the original drug
or one with similar pharmacological activity. The latter case, in
which different drugs can be used interchangeably in preventing
withdrawal symptoms, is called <i>cross-dependence. </i>As an
example, barbiturates and tranquillizers can be used in treating
the abstinence syndrome associated with chronic alcoholism. </p>

<p>Often the recovery phase associated with different drugs is<i>
</i>characterized by a rebound phenomenon dominated by activity
opposite to that produced by the drug. For instance, withdrawal
from the sedatives generally results in symptoms of acute and
toxic hyperactivation and physiological arousal, while the
pattern following intense stimulant (e.g. 'speed') use usually
involves sedation, depression and sleep. </p>

<p>Although physical dependence can develop with such common
drugs as alcohol and barbiturates, it is not a factor in the
drug-taking behaviour of the vast majority of regular users. In
the few individuals who become physically dependent on these
particular drugs, serious social, personal and physiological
consequences of drug use usually precede the physical dependence.
Therefore, although physical dependence is a serious medical
problem in a minority of sedative users, the abstinence syndrome
itself is not the cause of major public health problems. The
potent opiate narcotics, by contrast, tend to produce very
pronounced tolerance and physical dependence early in the history
of regular use. These features then soon become an integral part
of the particular drug problem presented by the opiate narcotics.
However, with these and other drugs, psychological factors in the
dependence are often more significant in the long run. </p>

<p><i>40. Psychological dependence </i>(also often called
behavioural, psychic or emotional dependence, and habituation) is
a much more elusive concept and is difficult to define in a
satisfactory manner. A World Health Organization paper69 defines
psychic dependence thus: 'In this situation there is a feeling of
satisfaction and a psychic drive that require periodic or
continuous administration of the drug to produce a desired effect
or to avoid discomfort.' A major problem with this definition is
the difficulty in operationally defining and objectively
identifying the characteristics of the dependence in a practical
situation. </p>

<p>By contrast, some scientists224 have identified behavioural
dependence as repeated self-administration of a drug. This
approach seems far too broad for most purposes since it only
indicates that the drug is in some way reinforcing or rewarding
to the user, and merely restates the observation that he takes
the drug. </p>

<p>Extreme instances of psychological dependence are easier to
identify and may be characterized by an intense craving for, or
compulsion to continue the use of, a drug with obvious
behavioural manifestations. In many instances, psychological
aspects may be considerably more important than physical
dependence in maintaining chronic drug use. The major problem
with opiate dependence is not the physical aspects, since
withdrawal can be successfully achieved in a few weeks, but the
great likelihood that the individual will later return to chronic
use due to psychological dependence. </p>

<p>In most instances of even regular non-medical use of drugs,
such intense psychological dependence probably does not occur.
However, more subtle psychological and social factors usually
have persisting effects in maintaining the behaviour of drug
consumption. </p>

<p>In talking about dependency in any context, whether dealing
with drugs or not, it would seem useful to specify what it is
that is being depended upon and for what reasons, and to identify
the consequences of its presence or its absence. The significance
of dependency changes considerably if the entity is relied upon,
for example, for the maintenance of life (e.g., insulin for the
diabetic) or for the escape from an unpleasant or intolerable
situation (e.g., privacy), or perhaps for a feeling of well-being
or satisfaction with life. In one sense psychological dependence
may be said to exist with respect to anything which is part of
one's preferred way of life. In our society, this kind of
dependency occurs regularly with respect to such things as
television, music, books, religion, sex, money, favourite foods,
certain drugs, hobbies, sports or games and, often, other
persons. Some degree of psychological dependence is, in this
sense, a general and normal psychological condition. </p>

<p>A statement in the preliminary brief of the Addiction Research
Foundation of Ontario reflects the complexity of interpreting the
question of dependency:4 </p>

<p>It should be recognized, however, that dependence is not
necessarily bad in itself, either for the individual or for
society. The question to he evaluated, therefore, is not whether
dependence can occur, but whether dependence in a given case
results in physical, psychological or social harm. </p>

<p><i>41. The concept of addiction. </i>The term 'addiction' has
had a variety of meanings, and a consensus as to the proper
definition seems unlikely, even in scientific circles. Often it
has been used interchangeably with dependence (psychological
and/or physiological), while at other times it appears to be
synonymous with the term 'drug abuse'. The classical model of the
addiction- producing drug was based on the opiate narcotics, and
has traditionally required the presence of tolerance, and
physical and psychological dependence. However, this approach has
not been generally satisfactory since only a few commonly used
drugs (e.g., alcohol and other sedatives), in addition to the
opiates, seem to fit the model at all. It is clearly
inappropriate for many other drugs which can cause serious
dependency problems. For example, amphetamines can produce
considerable tolerance and strong psychological dependence with
little or no physical dependence, and cocaine can produce
psychological dependence without tolerance or physical
dependence. Furthermore, in certain medical applications,
morphine has been reported to produce tolerance and physical
dependence without a significant psychological component. </p>

<p>Recognizing the problems with the concept of addiction, the
World Health Organization (WHO) proposed the following:69 </p>

<p>It has become impossible in practice, and is scientifically
unsound, to maintain a single definition for all forms of drug
addiction and/or habituation. A feature common to these
conditions as well as to drug abuse in general is dependence,
psychic or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical
agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by
substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type,
according to the agent or class of agents involved.... It must be
emphasized that drug dependence is a general term that has been
selected for its applicability to all types of drug abuse and
thus carries no connotation of the degree of risk to public
health or need for any or a particular type of drug control. </p>

<p>The WHO committee presented short descriptions of various
different types of drug dependence which may occur<b> </b>in some
individuals and situations. The list identifies drug dependence
of the morphine type, the barbiturate - alcohol type, the cocaine
type, the cannabis (marijuana) type, the amphetamine type, the
khat type, and the hallucinogen (LSD) type. Details of<b> </b>these
various kinds of drug dependence are discussed separately later
in this chapter. </p>

<p>For reasons analogous to those presented above, it is further
suggested here that the term dependent rather than the ambiguous
description 'addict' be used to refer to aft individual who has
developed drug dependence of either the physical or psychological
forms. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Scientific
Methods </h3>

<p>42<i>. The role of statistics. </i>Statistics can be helpful
in collecting and handling numerical or quantified information,
interpreting data, and making inferences or generalizations from
it. The simplest use of statistics is to describe or summarize
certain abstract characteristics of a group or sample. For
example, the average height of players on a basketball team
provides a shorthand description of the group. The numerical mean
is a common index of the average. Considerably more information
could be communicated if some idea of the variability of heights
within the team were known. The range of measures, for example,
is a crude index of the variance of 'spread' in the distribution
within a group. </p>

<p>A second function of statistics is to provide a system for
inference about some population on the basis of a smaller group
or sample selected from that population. For example, the mean
I.Q. of a group of 50 students randomly selected from a school
with 500 individuals might provide a reasonable estimate of the
average intelligence of the entire student population of that
school. The success of such generalization or extrapolation
depends on the relative size of the sample and the accuracy or
fidelity with which the group studied represents the overall
population of interest. Any bias in sampling which reduces the
similarity between the selected group and the population to which
the results are to be generalized reduces the validity of such
extrapolation. </p>

<p>Statistics may also assist in distinguishing between the
differences in measurements resulting from random variation and
the variance due to the factor which is being studied. By
obtaining an estimate of the natural variability in a population,
it may be possible to distinguish, with some confidence, between
a 'real effect' associated with a particular condition or
treatment, and the difference which might be expected by chance
alone. The phrase 'statistically significant' is used to indicate
an effect considered significantly greater than that likely due
to chance. </p>

<p>However, statistical techniques alone can only indicate an
association between different variables and can not actually
identify cause and effect. Such causal inferences must be based
on an overall consideration of the research design. In many
laboratory experiments, the stimulus and its response may be
readily identified, but in less tightly controlled social studies
(e.g., surveys) and clinical observations, it is often very
difficult or impossible to positively identify the causal
variable in a complex pattern of associations among different
characteristics of the sample. For example, the demonstration
that persons who are heavy users of tranquillizers also tend to
be regular alcohol drinkers does not necessarily indicate that
one causes the other. It may well be that a third factor (e.g.,
the desire to avoid or<i> </i>escape anxiety and tension) may be
responsible for both behaviours. Interpretation of the data
generally requires considerations beyond that involved in the
statistical analysis. </p>

<p>43. <i>Experimental methods. </i>Details of research design
would not be appropriate here, although some simple notions as to
elementary requirements for adequate experimental techniques in
psychopharmacology may be worthwhile. A major goal of scientific
research is to eliminate or control all factors, other than those
to be studied, which can influence or bias measurement. </p>

<p>As discussed above, the subjects of the study must be
sufficiently similar to the general population of ultimate
interest to allow generalization from the data. Extrapolation
from one animal species to another, from one human society to
another, or from one social group<b> </b>to another is often
quite tenuous and must be viewed with extreme caution. Variables
such as age, sex, and social class often exert considerable
influence on psychological measures, and must be taken into
careful consideration. </p>

<p>Unless there is some reason why a particular dose level is of <i>singular
</i>significance, more than one dose should be studied. If the
purpose of the experiment is to allow inferences of a general
social nature, then the dose, mode of administration and the
general circumstances of the study must be relevant to the
pattern of use in the general population. </p>

<p>In order to determine the effect of a particular treatment, it
is necessary to have a reference or control condition for
comparison, which has been treated identically to the
experimental condition except for the factor under analysis.
These data may be obtained from a separate group of control
subjects, which is sufficiently similar to the experimental
group, or from the same subjects studied at a different time. Due
to the great variation between individuals in response to drugs,
the latter approach is often most efficient, although it is
sometimes inappropriate or impractical. Using subjects as their
own controls requires special statistical techniques for handling
the data, since repeated experience in the situation will affect
the subject's subsequent performance through such mechanisms as
general adaptation, practice and other learning variables, and
often fatigue. </p>

<p>Care must be taken to control or eliminate the possible
effects of the subject's and researcher's expectations and
biases. Since set and setting play an important role in
determining drug effects, an inactive placebo substance should be
tested in a control situation under conditions which are
identical to those present when the drug is studied. Sometimes,
however, if the subject has had previous experience with the
experimental drug, he may soon realize whether he was given the
active drug or an inactive substance despite his initial lack of
information, and consequently the placebo control may not be
complete. An experimental design in which the subject is not
informed as to which treatment is being investigated is called a <i>single-blind
</i>study. </p>

<p>Since the scientist's bias and expectations can also influence
the subject's performance and the interpretation of his behaviour
(as well as the later data analysis), the validity of the
measurements can often be further increased it the researcher is
also unaware of which treatment condition is in effect at the
time of the experiment. A study in which neither the subject nor
the researcher knows which of the experimental treatment
variables are operating is called a <i>double-blind </i>design.
There are certain circumstances where a double-blind is
inappropriate or impossible, although it is often the most
efficient way to acquire specific information about drug effects
in an experimental situation. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">A
Review of Selected Drugs </h3>

<p>44. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a short
critical review of the scientific literature pertaining to the
effects of certain psychoactive drugs. Barbiturates, alcohol,
minor tranquillizers, amphetamines, LSD, cannabis, opiate
narcotics, and volatile solvents are discussed. In these interim
reviews an attempt has been made to concentrate on human
psychopharmacological studies rather than on animal experiments
or general social reports. Although original scientific sources
were sought and used as<b> </b>often as possible, it was
frequently necessary at this interim stage to rely on reviews
prepared by others. </p>

<p>There has been no attempt to be exhaustive in the references
presented in the text. These citations often indicate a typical
example chosen from among numerous sources which would have been
appropriate. The bibliography at the end of this chapter contains
a broader representation of some of the materials used in
preparing the summaries. <br>

<h3>BARBITURATES </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>45. The term 'barbiturate' generally refers to drugs which are
derivatives of barbituric acid. Barbital, the first drug of this
class to be synthesized, was introduced into medicine in Germany
in 1903. Barbiturates rapidly gained a wide usage as
tranquillizers, sedatives and hypnotics (sleep inducers) which
continues to this day. In the past half-century, over 2,000
different barbiturates have been synthesized, although less than
a dozen make up the bulk of current use. Among these are
amobarbital (Amytal*), pentobarbital (Nembutal*), phenobarbital
(Luminal*), and secobarbital (Seconal*). These drugs are
frequently referred to as 'barbs', 'nemmies', 'goof balls',
'yellow jackets', 'red devils', 'downers' or 'sleeping pills'. </p>

<p>The barbiturates are often classified by the duration of their
sedative or hypnotic action at a standard dose. Since the
similarities among these drugs exceed the differences, they will
be discussed in general terms as a group. </p>

<p>46. Barbiturates are among the most widely used psychoactive
drugs (medically and non-medically) in our society, and are the
toxic agents in thousands of accidental or intentional deaths
annually in North America. In addition, the barbiturates have
considerable potential for producing psychological and
physiological dependence, and are probably second only to alcohol
in frequency of drug-induced debilitation in modern society.
While a considerable body of research exists into the many
medical applications of these drugs, there has been relatively
little careful investigation of non-medical use. </p>

<p>Although the medical and non-medical use of barbiturates
appears to be widespread across age groups and social class, the
chronic use of these drugs, as with alcohol, seems to be
primarily an adult practice. Good epidemiological data in this
area are not available. Since prescription control is only
partially effective and possession of these drugs for personal
use without medical authorization is not a criminal offence and,
perhaps, because the users do not appear to form any homogeneous,
cohesive or easily recognized minority, the usual medical and law
enforcement statistics are of little assistance in assessing the
extent of non-medical use. </p>

<p>47. It has been frequently said that in Canada, the supply of
barbiturates lawfully manufactured or imported greatly exceeds
the requirements of legitimate medical use. It appears that many
current non-medical users were initiated into barbiturate use for
medical reasons. Numerous medical users develop dependence and
continue use long after the original medical purpose or
prescription is absent, and there are indications that most
chronic barbiturate users obtain the drugs through legitimate
channels.98 Since many physicians do not adequately maintain or
monitor prescription records, a patient may be able to arrange an
increase in the frequency and/or quantity of drug prescribed. In
addition, many chronic barbiturate<i> </i>(and other prescription
drug) users obtain 'legitimate' prescriptions from a number of
different doctors simultaneously, without the physicians'
awareness.79 Because of these patterns, the distinction between
medical and non-medical use of barbiturates is often particularly
difficult. Essentially all of the medical and non-medical
barbiturate supply in Canada is legitimately and professionally
manufactured; 'home-made' versions have not been identified. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>48. Barbiturates are commonly used in medical practice today
and it would seem likely that many households have had first-hand
experience with them. Most of the medical uses are based on the
sedative, hypnotic, and anti-convulsant effects of the drugs.
Barbiturates are widely prescribed where a general depression of
nervous system activity is desired. In low doses, they are widely
used as day-time sedatives or tranquillizers. The hypnotic effect
of these drugs is familiar to thousands of Canadians who use
barbiturates in higher dose in the form of the common sleeping
pill. Barbiturates are also often administered alone, and in
conjunction with other drugs, as anaesthetics in surgical and
related medical situations; but they are poor analgesics if used
alone. The anti-convulsant effects of certain barbiturates have
been very important in the treatment of acute convulsions
associated with drug dependence withdrawal symptoms, various
neurological disorders (including epilepsy), and poisoning due to
the overdose of such stimulants as strychnine, nicotine and
cocaine. </p>

<p>Other medical applications include diagnosis and attempted
therapy of certain psychiatric disorders. In these instances the
drug is usually administered intravenously in a dose adjusted to
keep the patient in a semi-conscious state in which inhibitions
are reduced and various suppressed and emotionally charged
material may be released. This procedure is essentially that used
in the so-called 'truth serum' application in criminal
investigations. This effect, then, is really just a carefully
monitored dose-response to ordinary short-acting barbiturates
and, while this procedure frequently results in information
different from that communicated normally, there is little
evidence that it really exposes the 'truth' as such. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>49. In crystalline form, barbiturates are odourless, white or
yellow powders, with a slightly bitter taste. They are available
as powders, elixirs, injections, suppositories, capsules or
tablets (both in sustained and delayed release forms). They are
frequently marketed for medical use in mixtures with other drugs,
such as other sedatives or tranquillizers, analgesics, belladonna
alkaloids (e.g., atropine or scopolamine), various stimulants
(e.g., amphetamine or caffeine), vitamins and various
gastrointestinal agents. </p>

<p>Barbiturates are usually administered orally for both medical
and non-medical purposes and are readily and efficiently absorbed
by the stomach, small intestine, and rectum. Absorption is more
rapid on an empty stomach than if the drug is taken immediately
after eating. Both intramuscular and intravenous injections are
also effective, but they are more prone to physiological
complication and are generally avoided except for special
purposes. While most chronic dependent users take barbiturates
orally, those who are experienced with self-injections (e.g.,
opiate narcotic or amphetamine dependents) may use the
intravenous route. </p>

<p>After absorption into the bloodstream, barbiturates are
initially distributed rather uniformly throughout the body, with
the latency of the psychological response being partly a function
of the facility of the particular drug in entering the brain. The
body eliminates barbiturate activity in several ways. Most
barbiturates are broken down or metabolized in the liver into
relatively inactive substances which are excreted by the kidney
in the urine, along with various quantities of the unaltered
drug. Temporary binding of drug molecules by plasma and tissue
protein soon after distribution, plus the affinity of certain
barbiturates for body tissue fats, may further shorten the
initial central nervous system (CNS) effects (and possibly
prolong other more subtle reactions). The preceding factors of
metabolism, excretion, and distribution are largely responsible
for the differences in potency and duration of action among the
different barbiturates. Acute and chronic barbiturate use can be
identified from blood and urine samples. 198 </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Effects </h3>

<p>50. Many of the psychological and behavioural effects of<b> </b>hypnotic
doses of barbiturates are quite similar to the alcohol
inebriation syndrome and consequently do not need much
elaboration. While the drug user may be able to discriminate
between the alcohol and barbiturate states subjectively, it is
extremely difficult to tell the difference from the user's
behaviour. </p>

<p>Although high doses invariably produce behavioural sedation,
drowsiness, and sleep, the effects of mailer quantities may be
quite unpredictable. As with alcohol and other sedatives,
barbiturates may initially produce behavioural excitation,
stimulation and lack of inhibition (especially at low doses),
rather than sedation, depending on the situation and the
individual. In certain persons, sedation is not produced until a
considerable quantity has been administered, whereas other
psychological and behavioural effects may be quite pronounced.
The user may become happy, pleasant, euphoric or 'mellow' on one
extreme, or possibly hostile, suspicious, aggressive and violent
on the other. Emotional depression, self-pity, and withdrawal are
also not uncommon, and barbiturate-related suicides are
frequently reported. Although low-dose effects are often erratic,
moderate to high doses generally slow down reaction time, impair
complicated mental functions, and produce a lessening of
inhibition, a reduction in emotional control, and an impairment
of physical co-ordination as well as a variety of other effects
resembling alcohol inebriation. Acute toxic psychoses are rare.
The extreme variability in response, even within the same
individual over a short period of time, is illustrated by
Wikler's report.243 </p>

<p>After intravenous injection of 0.25 to 1.0gm of amobarbital, a
subject may fall asleep if he lies in bed undisturbed, yet he may
be awake and voluble if interviewed by a psychiatrist, or he may
exhibit ataxia on attempting to walk back to his bed, but he may
'sober up' promptly when instructed to pose for a motion picture
demonstration of ataxia. </p>

<p>51. Frequent mention is made of a phenomenon called 'drug
automatism', associated with toxic barbiturate overdose,
although, many observers have expressed doubts as to its
significance. In this situation, the individual, in a
drug-induced state of confusion or stupor, is said to administer
additional doses of the drug without being fully aware of the
previous administration.148 </p>

<p>52. Although it appears certain that driving skills would be
diminished by barbiturate intoxication, little direct
investigation has been conducted. Related behavioural studies do
suggest such an effect. Low therapeutic doses may not reduce
driving ability, however, if the drug is not taken in conjunction
with other sedatives such as alcohol.72 </p>

<p>53. On the basis of existing evidence it would appear that the
long-term psychological effects of moderate barbiturate use are
negligible for most users. Some of the complications of chronic
high-dose use will be dealt with later. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>54. The short-term effect of moderate to high doses of
barbiturates is a general depression of neural and muscular
activity. As with psychological and behavioural effects, the
response to low dose is much more variable. Initially, the
electroencephalogram (EEG) may suggest cortical activation,
although this pattern is usually soon replaced by signs of
drowsiness or sleep. The sleep induced by hypnotic doses
generally resembles normal sleep with the exception of a marked
reduction in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage, the significance
of which is only beginning to be understood. Drowsiness or
'hangover' symptoms may follow acute intoxication or drug-induced
sleep. Although the sedative action of the barbiturates has
frequently been attributed to their effects on the reticular
activating system of the brain, little is known of the specific
details, and this action might occur through a variety of
different pharmacological mechanisms. </p>

<p>A variety of other transient or temporary physiological
changes may occur with moderate barbiturate use; the majority of
these apparently reflect a general 'slowing down' of
physiological activity (in the respiratory, cardiovascular and
other systems) normally occurring with behavioural sedation, and
are of little clinical significance. After even chronic
non-medical use there is generally a fairly complete recovery of
psychological and physiological capabilities following withdrawal
instances of permanent psychological or neurological disorder, or
of irreversible liver or kidney damage are rarely reported. This
is a rather surprising picture in light of the vast number of
disabilities attributed to chronic alcoholism and the general
pharmacological similarities between alcohol and the
barbiturates. It may be significant to note here that persons
physically dependent on barbiturates seem to be more likely to
maintain a reasonable state of nutrition than do chronic
alcoholics. </p>

<p>The toxic or poisoned state induced by barbiturate over-dose
is characterized by coma, a general shock syndrome (e.g., weak
rapid pulse, low blood pressure and cold sweaty skin) and may
result in death due to respiratory arrest, cardiovascular
collapse or kidney failure. If the over-dose is not fatal, a
temporary jaundice due to impaired liver function is likely to
follow and skin reactions may result. Some of these responses
will also occur to normal doses in individuals allergic to or
abnormally sensitive to the barbiturates. Because of the well
documented additive or potentiating effects (as well as
cross-tolerance) among the sedatives, users of related drugs,
such as alcohol, must be especially attentive to dose levels. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>55. Tolerance to some of the effects of barbiturates can be
demonstrated, although the degree and rate of tolerance
acquisition varies considerably with the dose, frequency of
administration and the individual. The potential for tolerance is
much lower with barbiturates than with the opiate narcotics, and
appears to level off at a maximum of 1.0 - 2.5gm. per day. (A
normal sleep-inducing dose might be around 0.1 - 0.3gm.) While
this loss of drug sensitivity is quite general and applies to
both sedative and mood effects, no tolerance appears to develop
to the lethal toxicity level since chronic users are as
susceptible to fatal over-doses as are initiates. In other words,
the safety margin decreases with increased tolerance. Several
mechanisms operate in producing tolerance. Barbiturates stimulate
the body's production of the metabolic enzymes which inactivate
the drug. Also, some insensitivity to the depressant effects
appears which might reflect a general neurological adaptation.
Certain learning processes are also probably involved in changing
the character of the response upon repeated administrations. Most
aspects of tolerance disappear after a few weeks of abstinence
from the drug. </p>

<p>Although barbiturates were not recognized as 'addictive' drugs
for decades after their general medical acceptance and usage, in
chronic users, physical dependence may develop along with
tolerance. Barbiturate dependence is in some respects similar to
opiate narcotic dependence, although barbiturate (and alcohol)
withdrawal symptoms are frequently more severe and are more
likely to result in death. The abstinence syndrome following
withdrawal of the drug in chronic heavy users may begin with a
reduction in intoxication and an apparent improvement in
condition. Within a few hours, however, general physical
weakness, dizziness, anxiety, tremors, hyperactivity, nausea,
abdominal cramps and vomiting may occur. These may be followed
after one-and-one-half to five days by muscle spasms and grand
mal (epileptic) seizures. Between the third and seventh day,
delusions and hallucinations may appear; this psychosis may last
for days or even months although recovery usually occurs within a
week or two. Death during the convulsive phase occasionally
occurs. 111, 89 </p>

<p>56. The full picture of barbiturate withdrawal only appears
after heavy chronic use, and the effects of abstinence following
more moderate consumption are considerably less severe, and may
manifest only a few of the classic symptoms. Many regular users
of therapeutic doses develop neither significant tolerance nor
physical dependence. As is the case with alcohol and opiate
narcotics, babies born of mothers physically dependent on
barbiturates are also physically dependent on the same drugs. </p>

<p>Psychological dependence also occurs in some users, and
anxious or tense individuals may become dependent on even small
doses in order to function in<b> </b>a manner which they consider
satisfactory. Many persons depend upon the hypnotic effects of
the barbiturates and can not sleep without a pill. In other
individuals, the drug may be depended upon for a variety of
subjective effects which the user considers essential to his
well-being. The problem of psychological and behavioural
dependence on barbiturates has not been adequately explored,
however, and remains in the area of clinical impression and
conjecture. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Barbiturates
and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>57. Because of the many similarities between barbiturates and
other sedatives, they are often used interchangeably. A certain
amount of cross-tolerance exists among these drugs, and chronic
users of barbiturates are generally quite resistant to many of
the effects of alcohol, minor tranquillizers and volatile
anaesthetics, as well. This cross-tolerance, however, does not
appear to affect the lethal dose, and large quantities of alcohol
and barbiturates taken simultaneously (acting in an additive
fashion) may produce a toxic or fatal reaction. In addition, the
sedative drugs have the capacity to be substituted for each other
in diminishing withdrawal symptoms, and barbiturates are
frequently used therapeutically to reduce the severity of
withdrawal in alcoholics. Since the sedatives show this
cross-dependence, individuals dependent on one may turn to other
sedatives if the supply of the preferred drug is restricted.
Consequently, chronic barbiturate dependents are usually heavy
alcohol users as well. Such multiple users often refer to the
barbiturate intoxication as a 'dry drunk'. Barbiturates have the
advantage of producing inebriation without the obvious odour of
alcohol. </p>

<p>The relationship between barbiturates and the opiate narcotics
is more complicated. These drugs may not show significant
cross-tolerance, although barbiturates can be useful in the
treatment of opiate narcotic withdrawal symptoms and<b> </b>may
effectively reduce the unpleasantness of the abstinence syndrome.
The drugs do interact in some sort of complementary way since
barbiturates are frequently, used by opiate narcotic dependents
to strengthen or reinforce a weak heroin dose or as a substitute
in an emergency. Many opiate users, however, avoid barbiturates
and consider the barbiturate-dependent person to be at the bottom
of the 'addict' community, together with the alcoholics. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Barbiturates are often used in conjunction with
        amphetamines. Dexamyl*, for example, is a combination of
        dextroamphetamine and amobarbital which supposedly
        produces stimulation without certain of the irritation or
        tension-producing effects of the amphetamines. More
        important clinically, is the frequently noted alternating
        cycle of sedation and stimulation which many medical and
        non-medical drug users demonstrate. A stimulant may be
        used to overcome the drowsy hangover the day after a
        hypnotic dose of barbiturate. By evening, another
        sedative dose may be necessary to overcome the insomnia
        potentiated by the day's amphetamine. This continuing
        cycle is apparently not at all uncommon among otherwise
        socially respectable drug users. A somewhat related
        pattern has been demonstrated by some amphetamine
        injecting 'speed freaks' who use barbiturates to
        terminate the stimulant effect or produce sleep after a
        'high' of several days' duration. </li>

<h3>ALCOHOL </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>59. Alcohol is one of the most widely used psychoactive drugs
known to man; it has apparently been with us since the dawn of
civilization. Breweries flourished in Egypt almost six thousand
years ago and there is evidence that Stone Age prehistoric man
made alcoholic beverages long before that.223 The use of alcohol
has appeared in varying degrees in most societies throughout
recorded history and has traditionally played an important
symbolic as well as pharmacological role in many social,
religious and medical practices and customs. Just as the use of
alcohol has been almost universal, so, apparently, has its
misuse. Consequently, some degree of opposition to 'drink'
appears to have arisen in all indulging cultures, although
attempts to eradicate its use have met with a uniform lack of
success. </p>

<p>What is this drug which has been hailed as the 'water of life'
and 'nectar of the gods' by some, and damned by others as 'second
only to war' as a source of human problems? Made up of three
common elements, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, ethyl alcohol
(C2H5OH) is a colourless, inflammable and volatile liquid. The
word 'alcohol' by itself is usually taken to mean ethyl alcohol
or <i>ethanol </i>(common beverage alcohol), although there is a
vast number of other substances in the aliphatic alcohol family,
many of which are highly toxic in even low doses. </p>

<p>Although the technique of producing alcoholic beverages by
fermenting fruit, grain, vegetables, and other food-stuffs has
hardly been a secret over the past few thousand years, the exact
process by which the drug is generated was first illuminated by
Louis Pasteur in the middle of the nineteenth century. His
investigations revealed that alcohol was produced by a single
celled microscopic plant, one of the yeast fungi, which by a
metabolic form of combustion breaks down certain sugars,
releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) with ethyl alcohol as a
by-product. This production of CO2 is responsible for the 'head'
on a glass of beer, and the 'popping' of champagne corks, as well
as the leavening effects of yeast in the rising of bread. Since
yeast cannot digest starch, mash from cereal grains such as
barley, rye, corn and rice must be malted (i.e., converted to
maltose sugar) prior to fermentation in the production of beer,
gin and whisky. </p>

<p>60. Fermentation normally continues until the sugar supply is
exhausted. However, as the amount of alcohol in the fermenting
solution increases, the metabolic activity of the yeast is slowed
until it is finally killed when the alcohol level reaches about
14%, thus setting a limit on the maximum strength of natural
(undistilled) beverages. The distillation process of boiling off
and isolating the more volatile alcohol from the other fluids
(mostly water) allows a further increase in ethanol
concentration. Although this technique was used in Middle Eastern
cultures centuries earlier, the production of 'spirits' by
distillation has been known in Europe for less than seven hundred
years. Today, ethanol can be produced synthetically. </p>

<p>In Canada, beer usually contains about 5% alcohol by volume,
natural wine 7% to 14%, fortified wine up to 20% and spirits or
liquor (distilled) approximately 40% alcohol. In other words, a
12 oz. bottle of beer or 3 to 4 oz. of wine contain about as much
alcohol as 11/2 oz. of whisky. </p>

<p>61. The notion of alcohol 'proof' originated centuries ago
from a crude but effective analytic technique designed to assess
the strength of spirits. If gun powder soaked with the beverage
exploded on ignition, this was taken as 'proof' that the liquor
was more than half alcohol. 'Proof spirit' in the United Kingdom
and Canadian system contains about 57% alcohol, while in the
United States proof is calculated as twice the per cent by volume
(e.g., 80% proof whisky is 40% alcohol).80 </p>

<p>Canada has experimented with alcohol prohibition in varying
ways since 1878. Although there are currently some 'dry'
localities, alcohol is generally legally available across the
country. An interesting bit of drug history is connected with
alcohol law: over 300 years ago the prohibition of liquor sales
to Indians was Canada's first alcohol regulation. Some such
discriminatory policies are only now being eliminated. 32 </p>

<p>62. There was a 15-year period of prohibition in the United
States, ending in 1934. The failure of that programme has been
attributed to the unworkable form of the laws, inadequate
enforcement, corruption among public authorities and, perhaps
most importantly, a general lack of public support. During that
period, the elimination of legitimate alcohol outlets resulted in
home breweries and distilleries, 'bootleg' liquor or toxic
substitutes, and smuggling, and created an economic vacuum
rapidly filled by organized crime. Many authorities feel that
this multi-million-dollar illicit market provided the initial
capital for the construction of a network of syndicated criminal
and quasilegal business empires which have considerable economic
and political strength in North America today. </p>

<p>Alcohol is now used by more than three-quarters of the
Canadian population over the age of 15. Although most of it is
undoubtedly consumed primarily for its pharmacological
properties, there is a significant aspect of alcohol usage which
is, in some respects, independent of its immediate drug effects.
There are many long-standing customs, traditions and
superstitions which pervade alcohol use in the Western world.
Because it has become an integral part of our culture, the set
and setting surrounding alcohol use is substantially different
from that associated with other drugs in Canada. </p>

<p>63. Alcohol may have special meanings in various social
contexts. Alcohol use is often symbolically and pharmacologically
associated with the acknowledgment of birth, death, marriage and
other contracts, adulthood, friendship, and, to some, it may
imply virility and masculinity. Although it is employed in some
religious ceremonies, many individuals have moral apprehensions
about alcohol and may approach its use with feelings of
ambivalence and guilt. Some reject it outright on grounds of
principle, while still others feel that moderate use is morally
acceptable. In many social circles abstinence is frowned upon and
'teetotallers' are looked upon with suspicion. On the other hand,
it is obvious that considerable alcohol intoxication is
tolerated, condoned and even encouraged in many situations in
North American society. When one considers the fact that these
various attitudes are ultimately tied to, or interact with, the
diverse pharmacological potentials of alcohol in determining the
overall drug effect, the complexity of the psychopharmacology of
the drug in North America becomes apparent. Because its use is so
ingrained at all levels of society, there is a tendency for many
Canadians not to even consider alcohol a drug. </p>

<p>In a wider context, Jaffe, in <i>The Pharmacological Basis of
Therapeutics </i>observes: 111 </p>

<p>The large role that the production and consumption of
alcoholic beverages plays in the economic and social life in
Western society should not permit us to minimize the fact that
alcoholism is a more significant problem than all other forms of
drug abuse combined. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>64. Alcohol is currently recognized as an official drug in the
British and U.S. Pharmacopeias, although the various alcoholic
beverages, as such, are no longer listed for medical use. Alcohol
has been cited over the past few thousand years as a cure for
nearly every ailment or disease. Most of the medical benefits
were probably more imagined than real, and many of alcohol's
legitimate pharmacological functions have now been filled by more
effective drugs, although it still plays a useful role in
medicine. </p>

<p>Alcohol is often used as a preservative, solvent, and vehicle
for other drugs, and is contained in tinctures, elixirs, spirits
and many medicinal syrups. It is used to cleanse, disinfect and
harden the skin, to cool it during fever, to decrease sweating
(and is included in many antiperspirant deodorant), to reduce bed
sores, to treat fainting, to temporarily or permanently block
nerves by injection, and to stimulate appetite and digestion. In
concentrations around 70%, alcohol is an effective antibacterial
agent, although it is not satisfactory for disinfecting open
wounds since it damages the raw tissue.186 </p>

<p>Alcohol is still sometimes recommended as a tranquillizer,
sedative, or hypnotic and may also serve as a mild mood stimulant
for<i> </i>some individuals. It is no longer considered a safe
surgical anaesthetic, since the dose necessary to produce
unconsciousness is often dangerously close to the fatal level.
However, the drug does produce mild analgesia (pain reduction) at
lower doses. Alcohol is still used in the lay and folk medicine
to 'treat' the common cold, although its benefits, if any, are
probably limited to an improvement in mood and increased
relaxation and rest. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>65. Alcohol is usually taken orally and is rapidly and
completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Some
absorption takes place in the stomach although diffusion into the
blood stream is most rapid from the upper intestine and,
consequently, the quicker the alcohol passes through the stomach
the shorter the latency of its action. Food eaten before or with
alcohol tends to decrease the drug effect by slowing stomach
emptying, and a meal before drinking alcohol may reduce the peak
alcohol level in the blood by almost one-half compared to that
attained by drinking on an empty stomach. Once absorbed, alcohol
is distributed quite uniformly in all bodily fluids, easily
enters the brain, and in pregnant women crosses the placental
barrier into the foetus. Alcohol temporarily diffuses into fat
tissue and consequently, a lean muscular individual will normally
experience a greater pharmacological effect with a given dose
than will a person with much body fat. </p>

<p>Approximately 95% of the alcohol in the body is broken down by
oxidation in the liver and the rest is excreted unchanged,
primarily in the urine and breath. While certain alcoholic
beverages, such as beer, contain some protein and carbohydrates,
alcohol itself provides only calories when metabolized and has
little general food value. Depending on the form of alcoholic
beverage and possible mixers, an ordinary drink may contain 90 to
150 calories or<b> </b>more. The rate of disappearance of alcohol
from the body is quite constant within individuals at a given
time, and the average 150 lb. man can metabolize about 9 ml. (0.3
oz) of alcohol per hour. </p>

<p>A convenient index of the quantity of the drug in the body is
the <i>blood alcohol level, </i>represented in per cent by
weight. Since the amount of alcohol excreted in the breath bears
a fixed relationship to that in the blood, it is possible to
accurately estimate the blood alcohol level from expired air.
This principle is utilized in the <i>Breathalyzer </i>tests now
employed in the enforcement of driving laws. </p>

<h3>Short-Term Effects </h3>

<p>66. Alcohol exerts its more significant effects through the
central nervous system, usually producing a general sedation or
depression of neural activity over a wide dosage range, although
in certain circumstances, considerable behavioural and
psychological arousal may result. Little is known as to the
specific mechanism by which alcohol produces its
psychopharmacological action. As with most drugs, alcohol
effects, especially those resulting from low or moderate amounts,
depend to a large extent on the individual and the situation in
which the drinking occurs. A drink or two may produce drowsiness
and lethargy in some instances, while the same quantity might
lead to increased activity and psychological stimulation in
another individual, or in the same person in different
circumstances. Furthermore, a dose which is initially stimulating
may later produce sedation. </p>

<p>In many social settings, alcohol seems to result in a
lessening of inhibition and a feeling of well being, sociability
and camaraderie in most individuals. For many people alcohol
relieves tension and anxiety - the common notion that one 'needs
a drink' when worried, irritated or upset, reflects a general
acknowledgment of this function. Although alcohol usually
elevates mood at first, a general lack of emotional control,
including anxiety, withdrawal, self-pity and depression may occur
later. Alcohol has been frequently cited as an important
contributing factor in many suicides. </p>

<p>Hostility and aggression are not at all uncommon in some
drinkers, and fights and other forms of violent antisocial
behaviour are often reported to accompany bouts of heavy
drinking. It appears that some criminals fortify their courage by
drinking prior to a sortie and alcohol intoxication reportedly
plays a significant role in a large proportion of the violent
crimes (murder, rape and assault against persons and property) in
North America.18 </p>

<p>67. Alcohol does not have a specific aphrodisiac (sex
stimulating) effect <i>per se, </i>although the emotionality and
general lessening of inhibitions often induced may lead to an
increase in sexual activity and other normally restricted
behaviour. An increase in desire or opportunity may be neglected
by acute sexual impotence, however. </p>

<p>Although delusions, illusions and amnesic 'black outs' may
occur in some individuals, acute alcohol psychosis (pathological
intoxication) in normally moderate drinkers is rare. Even so,
many persons might sympathize with the Roman philosopher Seneca
who, almost 2,000 years ago, observed that, 'Drunkenness is
nothing but a condition of insanity purposely assumed'.197 </p>

<p>In moderate amounts (e.g., a few drinks) alcohol may increase
or decrease heart rate, produce a 'flushing' or dilation of small
blood vessels in the skin (giving a sensation of warmth), lower
body temperature, stimulate appetite and the secretion of saliva
and gastric juices, increase urination, produce a slowing of the
electroencephalogram (EEG), increase reaction time, reduce
muscular co-ordination. In addition, alcohol generally reduces
performance on tests of a wide variety of psychological
functions. Tests requiring a high degree of attention,
concentration or vigilance are particularly sensitive to alcohol
effects, and impairment is usually most pronounced on complex and
recently learned tasks. In a few situations, however, a small
amount of alcohol may actually improve performance. In high
doses, alcohol produces drunkenness, disorientation and
confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, inadequate muscular
control, and often induces nausea and vomiting. As an increasing
quantity is ingested, there occurs a depression of respiration,
general anesthesia and unconsciousness and, rarely, death due to
respiratory arrest and circulatory failure. Acute alcohol
intoxication is often followed by pronounced 'hangover' symptoms
characterized by nausea, weakness, dizziness, poor coordination
and a variety of aches and pains. Some authorities consider this
post-inebriation phase a form of acute withdrawal syndrome. </p>

<p>68. Effects of alcohol on driving ability are well known -
even moderate amounts produce serious impairment in many
individuals. A recent study of alcohol involvement in fatal motor
vehicle accidents in three Canadian provinces presented findings
similar to those reported regularly across North America.37 It
has commonly been observed that alcohol is a factor in a large
proportion of all fatal traffic accidents. Approximately 70% of
drivers killed in single vehicle accidents and 50% of drivers
killed in multi-vehicle collisions had been drinking. Among all
driver fatalities, alcohol was detected in the blood of 60 to 70
per cent of those considered responsible for their own deaths.
Furthermore, more than half of the pedestrians killed in traffic
accidents had recently been drinking, and there are numerous
reports that alcohol is a contributing factor in a great number
of industrial accidents as well. A large proportion of the people
involved in such accidents are chronic alcoholics, although the
majority are apparently 'social' drinkers. </p>

<p>The intensity of the acute effects of alcohol can, to a
certain extent, be predicted from the amount of alcohol in the
blood, although the relationship between the quantity of alcohol
present and the central nervous system (CNS) response may vary
considerably from individual to individual. Recent Federal
legislation prohibits driving with blood alcohol level greater
than 0.08%. Depending on the person, this concentration may be
produced by three or four ordinary drinks, if consumed in a short
time. While certain individuals might be capable of driving
satisfactorily with this much alcohol, most persons are probably
impaired by even lower quantities. Although the <i>Breathalyzer </i>can
be used to assess acute alcohol intoxication, there are no simple
methods of detecting a 'hangover', and there are indications that
this post-inebriation phase also has severe effects on
psychomotor performance. </p>

<h3>Long-Term Effects </h3>

<p>69. Many authorities differentiate between 'low risk'
(moderate) and 'high risk' (heavy) drinking in discussing the
long-term effects of alcohol. For most otherwise normal
individuals, moderate drinking over a prolonged period of time
may produce little significant psychological or physiological
change. High risk or heavy drinking (e.g., five or six or more
drinks a day) may lead to a variety of disorders, however, many
of which are subsumed under the general term 'alcoholism'. </p>

<p>There<b> </b>is considerable disagreement among authorities as
to the proper delineation of the concept of alcoholism -
definitions may be as general as 'a family of disorders
accompanying chronic heavy drinking 'with various social and
economic complications, or may contain more restrictive
specifications of physical dependency or psychological and
physiological harm. Jellinek has described five different types
of alcoholics which differ in degree and kind of psychological,
behavioural and physiological involvement.112 In some areas of
North America, at least two per cent to five per cent of alcohol
users become alcoholics and many more would be considered problem
drinkers. </p>

<p>70. No group of drug-dependent persons presents a sorrier
picture of psychological and physiological pathology than that of
the 'skid row' derelict alcoholics. Frequently observed in these
individuals and many other alcoholics are disorders of the
digestive tract, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidney, pancreas
and the nervous system, with sleep disturbance and various kinds
of irreversible neurological damage and cerebral atrophy.
Considerable attention has been focused on liver disorders in
heavy drinkers, and it is well established that alcohol is a
major contributing or causal factor in liver cirrhosis.
Alcoholics may develop specific psychotic syndromes, permanently
impaired memory, epilepsy, chronic incoordination, sexual
impotence, loss of appetite and a variety of nutritional
disorders which may result in an increased susceptibility to
other diseases and infections.111 </p>

<p>In the past, these and numerous other disorders were thought
to be a direct result of alcohol toxicity, but now many of these
pathologies are considered to be of secondary origin - often a
function of chronic dietary deficiencies, poor personal care and
other aspects of the general life style which may accompany
alcoholism. The diet of certain alcoholics may consist of 40-50%
alcohol, with periods of weeks or even months of nothing else,
and thus may be dangerously low in proteins, vitamins, minerals
and other essential foodstuffs. Proper diet and medical care may
be able to prevent or alleviate many, but not all, of the
problems associated with chronic alcoholism.182 </p>

<p>Only a minority of alcoholics are 'down and out' derelicts,
and there are many alcohol-dependent persons in all levels of
society who function in varying degrees of effectiveness in spite
of the handicap. Psychological and physiological disorders in
these individuals vary considerably as a function of general life
style, drinking patterns and perhaps certain inherited
characteristics. Many heavy drinkers show little functional
impairment. </p>

<h3>Tolerance and Dependence </h3>

<p>71. Tolerance to most of the effects of alcohol develops with
frequent use, although it does not occur as rapidly or to the
same degree as with the opiate narcotics. The rate of acquisition
and extent of tolerance depends on the pattern of use, and
regular heavy drinkers may be able to consume two or three times
as much alcohol as a novice. In Western culture, some symbolic
masculinity frequently accompanies the development of tolerance
and the ability to 'hold one's liquor'. </p>

<p>Most intermittent or moderate drinkers show little tendency to
increase dose, although regular heavy drinkers may, in order to
obtain the desired psychological effects, ingest quantities which
lead to chronic alcohol toxicity symptoms. In addition to the
probable neurophysiological and metabolic mechanisms involved in
tolerance, learning to function under the influence of alcohol
may further reduce some of the acute behavioural effects of
intoxication in regular users. Little or no tolerance develops to
the lethal dose, however, and acute alcohol poisoning is a noted
cause of death in alcoholics, although nausea, vomiting and
unconsciousness usually prevent self-administration of a fatal
overdose. In some alcoholics, tolerance later seems to decline
and a special response or oversensitivity to certain effects of
alcohol develops. In such individuals even a single drink may
produce profound loss of control and initiate unrestricted
further indulgence. </p>

<p>72. Physical dependence on alcohol occurs in some long-term
heavy drinkers after the development of tolerance. Although
alcoholic hallucinosis, delirium tremens ('DT's), and convulsions
('rum fits') were noted and studied in the nineteenth century,
until recently there was a lack of consensus as to whether these
symptoms were essentially the direct result of acute or chronic
alcohol toxicity, secondary nutritional deficiencies, or part of
a physical dependence withdrawal syndrome. </p>

<p>Isbell <i>et al</i>108<i> </i>and Mendelson <i>et al</i>156<i>
</i>have clearly demonstrated that even when diet is controlled,
a characteristic severe abstinence syndrome can occur after only
a few weeks of continual heavy drinking. The quantities of
alcohol ingested in these studies were much greater than those
normally consumed, however, and with the usual drinking patterns,
such physiological dependence does not occur until after 3 to 15
or more years of heavy consumption. Some heavy drinkers never
become physically dependent on alcohol.112 </p>

<p>73. The overall picture of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is
generally similar to that noted earlier for barbiturates. Nausea,
anxiety, severe agitation, confusion, tremors, and sweating are
followed by cramps, vomiting and illusions and hallucinations.
After several days, delirium tremens may develop and convulsions,
exhaustion and cardiovascular collapse may occur. The delirium
tremens stage is fatal in about 10% of cases. Major recovery in
those surviving usually occurs within a week, although certain
psychological symptoms may continue for a longer period.234 </p>

<p>Psychological dependence on alcohol seems to occur<b> </b>in
many individuals, and such dependence appears to be generally
accepted in contemporary North America. A great number of people
regularly turn to alcohol for relief or aid prior to or after
facing a stressful situation, to escape worries, troubles or
boredom, to relax and enjoy a party, or even to sleep, and many
feel they do not function as well in certain situations without a
drink or two. There would appear to be a strong psychological
component in the drinking behaviour of the developing alcoholic,
as<b> </b>is exemplified in the usually compulsive nature of his
drinking and his frequent inability to control his use of alcohol
in spite of obvious consequences. </p>

<h3>Alcohol and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>74. A certain degree of cross-tolerance and cross-dependence
occurs among the sedative drugs. Heavy alcohol users are normally
resistant to the effects of barbiturates, minor tranquillizers,
volatile solvents and anaesthetics, as well as alcohol, although
the cross-tolerance does not significantly affect the lethal
dose. Consequently, many over-dose deaths occur due to the mixing
of these drugs in chronic users. Barbiturates and minor
tranquillizers effectively block alcohol withdrawal symptoms and
are frequently used in treating alcoholics in the acute phase of
abstinence. Alcoholics are often heavy users of other sedative
drugs as well and may switch from one to another, if it<b> </b>is
convenient or necessary. The use of high toxic alcohols, such as
methyl or 'wood' alcohol, and even automobile anti-freeze, has
been reported in derelict alcoholics. In addition, persons
dependent on opiate narcotics generally have a history of heavy
alcohol consumption. </p>

<p>75. Certain drugs, such as disulfiram (Antabuse*) or
Temposil*, which may have little direct pharmacological activity
themselves, have the capacity to inhibit certain stages of
alcohol metabolism in the body and can thereby produce a highly
unpleasant toxic reaction known as the <i>acetaldehyde syndrome </i>when
used in conjunction with alcohol. Such drugs have been used in
the treatment of problem drinkers. </p>

<p>Amphetamines, caffeine and other stimulants may reduce the
drowsiness often associated with inebriation, although they can
not fully compensate for most of the effects of alcohol
intoxication. <br>

<h3>MINOR TRANQUILIZERS </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>76. The term 'minor tranquilizers' was introduced into the
scientific literature in the 1950s to distinguish the medicines
prescribed to reduce anxiety and tension from the <i>major </i>tranquillizers,
like reserpine and chlorpromazine, which are employed (as
antipsychotic drugs) in the treatment of severe mental illness
such as schizophrenia. Another phrase, often used interchangeably
with the words 'minor tranquilizers' is <i>anxiolytic sedatives. </i>This
class of drugs may be defined as substances which reduce anxiety,
tension and agitation without other significant effects on
cognition or perceptual processes. </p>

<p>It seems safe to say that the optimal anxiolytic sedative,
which effectively separates anxiety-reducing properties from
those producing undesired psychological side effects does not yet
exist. There are a variety of drugs of several chemical classes
which approximate these criteria, however: bromides, paraldehyde,
chloral hydrate; the newer minor tranquillizers such as
meprobamate (Miltown*), diazepam (Valium*), and chlordiazepoxide
(Librium*) and assorted other compounds (e.g., ethchlorvynol,
glutethimide) which do not fall into a neat chemical
classification. Alcohol and barbiturates are also<b> </b>often
considered with the anxiolytic sedatives, although we will keep
them separate in the following discussions since they have
already been covered in previous sections of this report. </p>

<p>77. Most minor tranquillizers fall between alcohol and
barbiturates in sedative action at a therapeutic dose. The
disparate classes of chemicals have generally similar
physiological action and will be treated as a group, with
individual differences sometimes characterized. The minor
tranquillizers have tended to replace barbiturates as day-time
sedatives in recent years. These drugs and other sedatives are
commonly referred to as 'downers' in the drug argot. </p>

<p>In Canada and the U.S.A., well over $500 million is spent each
year on sedative drugs, to treat a wide variety of symptoms
falling under the category of anixety.131 Although there are no
statistics available to us at this time on the Canadian imports,
exports, manufacture, production or sale of minor tranquillizers,
many observers feel that the supply greatly exceeds medical
needs. The distribution route which the drugs follow after
production is not known, and a considerable percentage may be
diverted for non-medical use. Clandestine manufacture of minor
tranquillizers does not appear to occur and all such drugs
initially start into the market as lawful materials. As described
in the section on barbiturates, patients may be able to procure
large quantities of these drugs through legitimate prescription
channels. </p>

<p>79. In the U.S., production figures for tranquillizers exceed
those for 'sleeping pills', 'pep pills', and opiate narcotics
combined.77 In additional,178 </p>

<p>In 1965 in the U.S.A., some 58 million new prescriptions and
108 million refills were written for psychotropes (sedatives,
tranquillizers and stimulants) and these 166 million
prescriptions accounted for 14% of the total prescriptions of all
kinds written in the United States. </p>

<p>79. Minor tranquillizers are so widely prescribed that the
American Medical Association warned doctors about
overprescription and outlined ways in which the 'misuse of
sedatives' by 'the prolonged and unsupervised<b> </b>administration
of (tranquillizers) for symptomatic relief often without adequate
diagnosis or knowledge of the patient's past experience with
medications, or attitudes towards drugs' is aggravated.8 Evidence
in these recent U.S. surveys indicates that the minor
tranquillizers and other sedatives are more commonly used than
the stimulants among respondents above age 20. </p>

<p>The minor tranquillizers, along with barbiturates, tobacco,
and alcohol, are among the most widely used drugs in North
American society, and are the toxic agents in a large number of
poisoning cases. Since chronic tranquillizer dependence may be
quite frequent, and may involve considerable impairment, the
public's relative indifference to the hazards of tranquillizer
pill-popping is quite alarming. As in the case of alcohol and
barbiturates, much research on medical use has been done, but
little investigation of non-medical use of tranquillizers has
been carried out. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>80. Minor tranquillizers are widely used in medical practice
today, and are mainly prescribed for patients suffering from
anxiety, tension, behavioural excitement and insomnia. They are
also used in the treatment of lower back pain, convulsive
disorders and withdrawal symptoms of opiate narcotic and alcohol
dependence. </p>

<p>Some clinicians feel that chemotherapy of anxiety is a
secondary approach (although frequently the most expedient) and
that the minor tranquillizers should be used primarily to relieve
immediate distress, and to aid the patient only until other
treatment procedures become effective. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>81. Minor tranquillizers are usually administered orally as
elixirs or<b> </b>tablets, but are also sometimes injected, for
both medical and non-medical purposes. They are generally rapidly
absorbed by the stomach, intestine and rectum, and the absorption
is most rapid with an empty stomach. Once absorbed, the drugs are
distributed quite uniformly throughout the body, with the latency
of response dependent on the particular chemical class. Some are
metabolized, or otherwise chemically altered (usually in the
liver), and excreted into the urine, while others are eliminated
unchanged. The factors of distribution, metabolism, and
excretion, are primarily responsible for differences in potency
and duration of action of the different minor tranquillizers. The
detection of some acute and chronic tranquillizer use is not
easy, and the methods of detection of the metabolites in urine
are highly sophisticated and expensive. </p>

<h3>Psychological Effects </h3>

<p>82. Many of the psychological effects of minor tranquillizers
are similar to those observed with alcohol and barbiturates. As
with these other sedatives, psychological and behavioural
responses to low doses of minor tranquillizers are quite
variable. There may be a sedation in some instances and, in
others, an increase in activity. Studies reveal that complex
interactions between the type of drug and the level of anxiety
occur, even within the same pharmacological group; the drugs may
impair or improve performance, depending on dose and the degree
of anxiety present.131 </p>

<p>Normal doses usually provide relaxation, a feeling of
well-being and perhaps some loss of inhibition. With excessive
use of these drugs the following effects may be observed;
disorientation, confusion, memory impairment, trance-like
episodes, double vision, personality alterations, rage reactions
and other symptoms resembling those of drunkenness. Such
manifestations are difficult to differentiate from the
inebriation caused by barbiturates and alcohol. </p>

<p>83. It appears that driving skills may not be impaired at
clinical doses, so long as the user is not already drowsy or has
not taken other sedatives such as alcohol. At higher doses,
driving skills are more likely to be seriously impaired. One
report states that the accident rate in a group of drivers using
prescribed doses of Librium* was 10 times the general accident
rate for New York State, but it is not clear whether the accident
rate among these drivers who 'needed' a tranquillizer, was so
high because of, or in spite of, the drug they were taking.167 In
Canada it is an offence to drive under the influence of drugs,
and the penalties are similar to those for drunken driving,
although convictions involving tranquillizers are rarely
reported.. </p>

<h3>Physiological Effects </h3>

<p>84. The response to moderate and high doses of minor
tranquillizers is a general depression of nervous and muscular
activity and several other bodily functions. Compared with other
sedatives, the newer minor tranquillizers may have less
inhibitory effect on the parts of the brain which are responsible
for arousal and motor control and may have greater muscle
relaxant effects. The minor tranquillizers affect the levels of
some neurohumors in the brain which may be involved in the
tension-anxiety states. However, the exact mechanism by which
these drugs produce their effects is unknown. </p>

<p>Side effects observed with these drugs include drowsiness,
ataxia, lethargy, skin rashes, nausea, diminished sex interest,
menstrual and ovulatory irregularities, blood abnormalities and
increased sensitivity to alcohol. High doses may depress
respiration, produce unconsciousness and coma and can produce
death. There is no clear evidence of permanent irreversible
damage to neurological or other physiological processes even with
long-term non-medical use. The fact that chronic users of minor
tranquillizers maintain a reasonable diet and are not reported to
suffer from malnutrition, may account for some of the differences
between the chronic effects of tranquillizer use and alcoholism. </p>

<h3>Tolerance and Dependence </h3>

<p>85. Tolerance usually develops to most of the effects of the
minor tranquillizers on repeated use and the dose must often be
increased in order to obtain the desired effects. No tolerance
develops to the lethal toxicity, however, and chronic users must
be especially attentive to the quantities consumed. With one or
two exceptions, these drugs have been reported to produce both
psychological and physiological dependence, resembling that seen
with alcohol and the barbiturates. </p>

<p>The clinical descriptions of the abstinence syndrome, reported
to follow abrupt withdrawal, after excessive dosages of the minor
tranquillizers, indicate a marked similarity to one another and
to alcohol and barbiturates. The syndrome may be characterized by
anxiety, apprehension, tremulousness, muscle twitches, insomnia,
headache, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomit, abdominal
cramps, sweating, tachycardia, fainting, hyperactive reflexes,
convulsions, and uncontrolled urination and defecation. In
addition, delirious states can occur with motor agitation,
hallucinations, delusions, disorientation and confusion. The
abstinence syndrome can be very serious, and deaths have been
attributed to withdrawal of meprobamate (Miltown*) and
methyprylon (Noludar*).72 </p>

<h3>Minor Tranquillizers and Other Drugs </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Cross-tolerance and cross-dependence exist among the
        minor tranquillizers and with other sedative drugs. This
        cross-tolerance does not appear to affect the lethal dose
        and, consequently, alcohol or barbiturates taken
        simultaneously with large quantities of minor
        tranquillizers may act additively and produce toxic or
        fatal reactions. Heavy users of these drugs may switch
        among the sedatives, if necessary or convenient, and
        alcoholics often use barbiturates and tranquillizers to
        sustain inebriation. Individuals dependent on opiate
        narcotics often also use large quantities of minor<b> </b>tranquillizers.

<p>AMPHETAMINES </p>

<p> </p>

<p>87. Amphetamines are synthetic amines which are in many ways
similar to the body's own adrenaline (epinephrine). These drugs
generally evoke an arousal or activating response not unlike
one's normal reaction to emergency or stress. Amphetamines were
first synthesized in the early part of the century and entered
medical use by the 1930s. Although a variety of related drugs and
mixtures currently exist, the most common amphetamine substances
are amphetamine (Benzedrine*), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine*),
and methamphetamine (Methedrine* or Desoxyn*), with Benzedrine*
being the least potent. Generally, if the dose is adjusted, the
psychological effects of these various drugs are similar and,
consequently, they will be discussed as a group. Other drugs with
somewhat similar pharmacological properties are phenmetrazine
(Preludin*), methylphenidate (Ritalin*) and pipradol (Meratran*).
Common slang terms for amphetamines include: 'speed', 'crystal',
'meth', 'bennies', 'dexies', 'A', 'uppers', 'pep pills', 'diet
pills', 'jolly beans', 'truck drivers', 'co-pilots', 'eye
openers', 'wake-ups', 'hearts' and 'footballs'. </p>

<p>The stimulating effects of the amphetamines were widely used
by soldiers during World War II to counteract fatigue. Since
then, they have been commonly used both medically and
non-medically by vehicle drivers on long trips, night-shift
workers, fatigued housewives, students studying for exams and
others who must meet deadlines, athletes for increasing
performance, and others for general stimulation, pleasure or fun.
</p>

<p>88. In the 1940s, much of the wartime stockpile was dumped on
the world market and in many countries amphetamines were
available on a non-prescription 'over the counter' basis.
Widespread use followed in most industrialized areas with
numerous unpleasant consequences. Use reached epidemic
proportions, for example, in Japan in the 1950s - a country which
had never had a previous serious drug problem.34 Since this time,
amphetamines have been quite uniformly put under governmental
control and<b> </b>in some countries (e.g., Sweden) are currently
prohibited from medical and non medical applications. Although
the popularity of both medical and non-medical rise of these
drugs spread rapidly in all age groups and social classes in
North America after the war, heavy use was apparently largely
confined to delinquents and to members of the criminal-addict
population of a few decades ago. The drug was usually taken
orally, sometimes injected by heroin addicts, or sniffed. In many
instances it was used interchangeably with cocaine (a shortacting
but powerful stimulant). Frequent use was made of 'dismantled'
Denzedrine inhalers, which were on the unrestricted legal market
at that time. </p>

<p>More recently, major concern has developed in many circles for
a relatively new amphetamine phenomenon - that of massive doses
used intravenously by persons often referred to as ,speed
freaks'. Although this practice has been most frequently noted
among youthful multi-drug-taking individuals, considerable
opposition to such use of amphetamines has developed within the
'hip' community. The 'speed trip' is in many respects the
antithesis of the experience sought with the psychedelic drugs.
Instead of the orientation towards the 'consciousness expansion',
personal insight, and aesthetic and religious awareness often
attributed to the psychedelic drug experience by users, the speed
phenomenon is usually characterized by action, power, arrogance
and physical pleasure ('kicks'), and regularly leads to
suspicion, paranoia, hostility and often aggression. In addition
to these undesirable personality changes, which render 'speed
freaks' highly unpopular in the community, such individuals
generally present a picture of chronic ill-health unparalleled
among youthful drug users. </p>

<p>89. The message received by the Commission at public and
private hearings, and in written communications with youthful
drug users has been mostly negative towards 'speed'. Many
experienced illicit drug users consider amphetamines extremely
dangerous and undesirable, and have expressed surprisingly
hostile attitudes towards these drugs in no uncertain terms.
Recently, numerous persons well known to youth, who have had
considerable influence on drug attitudes during the past decade
(e.g.,, John Lennon and the Beatles, Frank Zappa and the Mothers
of Invention, Timothy Leary, and Donovan), have made public
statements against the use of 'speed' and related drugs. </p>

<p>Many physicians have suggested that the supply of amphetamines
legitimately imported and manufactured in Canada greatly exceeds
medical need. As with other prescription drugs which are widely
used, such as the barbiturates and tranquillizers, the
distinction between medical and non-medical use is not always
easily made. </p>

<h3>Medical Use </h3>

<p>90. As early as 1935, amphetamines (in doses from 20-200 mg)
were found to be a specific treatment for narcolepsy, an uncommon
illness which is characterized by sudden attacks of sleep and
weakness. Since the 1940s, amphetamines (in doses of 10-50<i> </i>mg)
have been used in the treatment of overactive children who showed
disorders of attention and impairment of learning capacity. In
the last few years, several investigators have again published
results of clinical trials which revealed that amphetamines and
methylphenidate were among the most effective treatments for
these childhood disorders. </p>

<p>Psychiatrists have frequently used intravenous injections of
methedrine (in doses of 15-30mg) for diagnostic purposes.
Administered in this fashion, the drug induces a state of
excitation, elation and increased talkativeness, during which a
previously inhibited patient might reveal information and
symptoms which may be considered important for the understanding
of his disorder. He might also express, more freely, previously
suppressed emotions. It has been observed that some patients with
a borderline psychosis show typical psychotic symptoms more
clearly following an injection of amphetamines. </p>

<p>At one time, these drugs were used in the treatment of
alcoholism and opiate narcotic dependency, but this practice was
abandoned because amphetamines often produce dependency when
taken for longer than two or three weeks. Since alcoholism is a
chronic condition, some alcoholics who took this treatment for
long periods of time became dependent on amphetamines and
alcohol. </p>

<p>91. Early hopes that amphetamines would prove to be an
effective general treatment for severe depression were soon
disappointed. Although these drugs are powerful stimulants and
increase a depressed person's activity, they may also make him
more anxious and agitated, deprive him of sleep, and may fail to
elevate his mood or to reverse the fundamental depressive
process. In some individuals, these drugs have been effective in
relieving mild depression and chronic fatigue, however. </p>

<p>Amphetamines, and some related drugs, have a strong
suppressive effect on appetite. Most so-called 'diet pills'
contain amphetamines or similar preparations. However, the
appetite suppressing action of amphetamines usually disappears
after about two weeks, together with the pleasant stimulating
effects, unless the dose is<b> </b>continuously increased. </p>

<p>Amphetamines have also been occasionally used to treat petit
mal epilepsy, parkinsonism, pregnancy nausea, asthma, nasal
congestion and sedative poisoning. Many observers feel that
because of the risk of dependency and undesirable personality
change with amphetamines, even the medical use of these
substances should be severely restricted. </p>

<h3>Administration, Absorption, Distribution and Physiological
Fate </h3>

<p>92. Amphetamines are available in a variety of tablets,
capsules (both in immediate and delayed release forms), elixirs,
injections and, until recently, inhalers. These drugs also appear
in powder ('crystal') form on the black market. Amphetamines are
available commercially combined with such drugs as barbiturates
(e.g., Dexamyl*) and other sedatives, atropine, caffeine,
vitamins and minerals,<b> </b>thyroid extract, and, on the
illicit market, amphetamines are reportedly sometimes added to
LSD. One of the most esoteric pharmaceutical combinations has
been described as follows:133 'This is a multi-coated tablet of
pentobarbital on the outside to induce sleep rapidly,
phenobarbital under a delayed dissolving coating to extend the
sleep, and under another coating, an amphetamine to awaken the
patient in the morning.' </p>

<p>Amphetamines are usually administered orally and are readily
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally both
intramuscular and intravenous injections are used medically. In
the past, an amphetamine-base inhaler was also available.
Non-medical users may employ any of these administration routes,
including sniffing 'crystal', although chronic 'speed freaks'
prefer intravenous injections. </p>

<p>About half of the amphetamine which enters the body is
excreted unchanged in the urine, the remainder being previously
deactivated or chemically altered in the liver prior to
elimination. Although excretion is generally rather rapid, traces
of the drug can be found in the urine up to a week after
withdrawal. Because of the considerable proportion excreted
unchanged, certain individuals have been known to extract and
reuse crystals obtained from the urine. (This general practice of
'reclaiming' excreted drugs is not new and such procedures have
been recorded for centuries.) </p>

<h3>Effects </h3>

<p>93. Both the psychological and physiological response to
amphetamines vary profoundly with dose, and the effects of
intravenous<b> </b>injections of massive quantities may differ
greatly in character from, and bear little resemblance to,
responses to low doses administered orally. These effects vary
continuously over the full dosage range, but for clarification in
the following discussions, the use of moderate quantities of
amphetamines will be separated from the discussion of the
practice of high-dose intravenous injection. </p>

<p>94.<i> Moderate dose effects. </i>At typical therapeutic doses
(e.g., 5-30 mg), amphetamines produce electrophysiological signs
of central nervous system (CNS) activation along with a variety
of adrenaline-like peripheral (sympathomimetic) effects such as
increased blood pressure, pulse-rate and blood sugar, slight
dilation of some blood vessels and constriction of others,
widening of the pupils, increased respiration rate, depression of
appetite and some relaxation of smooth muscle. Such effects might
last 3-4 hours. </p>

<p>The psychological response varies considerably among
individuals, but might typically include increased wakefulness,
alertness, and vigilance, improvement in concentration and a
feeling of clearer thinking, greater responsiveness to
environmental stimuli, decreased fatigue and boredom, elevation
of mood, mild euphoria, a feeling of sociability, increased
initiative and energy, and increased verbal and other behavioural
activity. There may be an improvement in some simple mental
tasks, and athletic performance may be increased. In general,
improved functioning is most likely to occur when prior
performance was at a subnormal state due to drowsiness, fatigue
or boredom. </p>

<p>On the other hand, a moderate dose of amphetamines in
different individuals (or perhaps even in the same individual at
different times) might produce irritation, restlessness,
insomnia, blurred vision, tremor, nausea, headache, inability to
concentrate, dizziness, heart palpitation, confusion, anxiety,
chest pains, chilliness, diarrhoea or constipation, and other
adverse symptoms. In cases of higher dose or hypersensitivity,
delirium, panic, aggression, psychosis, hallucinations and
cardiovascular abnormalities may occur in some individuals.
Although deaths are rare, some have been reported among
athletes.15 </p>

<p>95. After continued administration of moderate doses, recovery
may be associated with fatigue, drowsiness and, not infrequently,
emotional depression. The increased energy and alertness elicited
by the drug merely postpones the need for rest and clearly
provides no long-term substitute for it. Many regular users of
stimulants rely on the drug for energy when fatigued and often do
not get proper rest for long periods of time. </p>

<p>The amphetamine toxic psychosis may be indistinguishable from
schizophrenia.56 While this syndrome is generally associated with
high-dose use, many of the symptoms have been observed with the
use of more moderate amounts. There does not appear to be any
irreversible physiological damage associated with long-term use
of moderate doses of amphetamines although temporary disorders do
occur. </p>

<p>96.<i> Tolerance and dependence with moderate doses. </i>Tolerance
to the various drug effects develops at different rates and to
different degrees - some responses 'drop out' in chronic use
sooner than others. The tendency to increase dose depends upon
which of the potential drug effects is rewarding or reinforcing
drug use. Many individuals, for instance, who use amphetamines to
control narcolepsy, may reach a stabilized dose and show very
little need for increased quantity over a period of years. On the
other hand, those using the drug to control appetite generally
increase their dose. Many psychological effects, such as the
mood-elevating response, may show a considerable sensitivity to
tolerance, and individuals who either began using the drug to
obtain these effects, or who acquired the taste for them after
initially using amphetamines for other<b> </b>purposes, generally
show a marked tendency to increase dose over time. Tolerance to
some of the toxic properties occurs, and certain chronic users
administer thousands of milligrams intravenously in a day, while
even a fraction of that quantity would be extremely toxic in a
non-tolerant user. As with other drugs, the rate of development
of tolerance to the different pharmacological effects depends on
the doses used, the frequency of administration and various
individual factors. No suggestion of physiological dependence on
amphetamines occurs with moderate doses; but psychological
dependence on even low doses is frequently reported, and is
considered a major hazard in both medical and non-medical
amphetamine use. </p>

<p>97.<i> High-dose effects. </i>The chronic high-dose
intravenous amphetamine syndrome has recently been described by
several authors.124, 71 The cycle or pattern of use usually
begins with several days of repeated injections (usually of
Methedrine*), gradually increasing in magnitude and frequency.
Some users<b> </b>may 'shoot' or 'crank' up to several thousand
milligrams in a single day. Initially the user may feel
energetic, talkative, enthusiastic, happy, confident and
powerful, and may initiate and complete highly ambitious tasks.
He does not sleep and usually<b> </b>eats very little. After the
first few days, however, toxic unpleasant symptoms become
stronger, especially as the dose is increased. These toxic
effects may be similar to those described earlier for lower
doses, but appear in amplified form. Some symptoms commonly
reported at this stage are: confused and disorganized patterns of
thought and behaviour, compulsive repetition of meaningless acts,
irritability, self-consciousness, suspiciousness, fear, and
hallucinations and delusions which may take on the
characteristics of a paranoid psychosis. Aggressive and
anti-social behaviour may occur at this time. Severe chest pains,
abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis and fainting have also been
reported .207 </p>

<p>Towards the end of the 'run' (usually less than a week), the
toxic symptoms<b> </b>dominate; the drug is discontinued, fatigue
sets in, and prolonged sleep follows, sometimes lasting several
days. Upon awakening, the user is usually lethargic, often
emotionally<b> </b>depressed and ravenously hungry. The user may<b>
</b>overcome these effects with another injection - thus
initiating the cycle anew. Runs are often separated by days or
weeks, however, at a<b> </b>time. In certain instances, 'down'
drugs, such as barbiturates or tranquillizers, or even opiate
narcotics may be used to 'crash' or terminate a run which has
become intolerable or otherwise unpleasant. </p>

<p>98. The immediate effects of the intravenous injection of
amphetamines are a sudden, overwhelming pleasurable 'rush' or
'flash' which has been described by users as 'an instant total
body orgasm'. This effect is qualitatively different from the
warm, drifting sensation associated with the opiate narcotics,
but is reported to be initially similar to the 'splash' produced
by intravenous cocaine.124 Some users claim that the immediate
pleasure of the injection is the prime motivation for the drug
use and that other effects are secondary. </p>

<p>Some individuals report that sexual activity is prolonged, and
may continue for hours. When orgasm finally comes it may be more
pleasurable than normal, although, on the other hand, some
describe an inability to reach a climax. While only a minority of
users report increased sexual activity, some people give this
reason as a primary one for taking the drug. 124,23 </p>

<p>Some investigators have reported that many users claim that
they take the drug for euphoria or 'kicks', or because it enables
them to be more confident and active. In addition, there are
reports of 'needle freaks', in whom the use of the hypodermic
syringe has special rewarding connotations. </p>

<p>99. The clinical picture of the chronic 'speed freak', is a
distressing one indeed. Continued use of massive doses of
amphetamines often leads to considerable weight loss, sores and
non-healing ulcers, brittle fingernails, tooth grinding, chronic
chest infections, liver disease, a variety of hypertensive
disorders, and in some cases, cerebral haemorrhage. 124<b> </b>The
extent to which these effects are the direct result of the drug
or the secondary consequences of poor eating habits, over
exertion and improper rest is unclear. Further complications may
be caused by unsterile injections, including hepatitis and a
variety of other infections.47 Although some users feel that
certain of their mental abilities have been impaired by
amphetamine use, no clear picture of permanent brain damage has
been demonstrated. </p>

<p>100. Heavy use of amphetamines frequently precipitates a
psychosis which is indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenia.
In addition, several investigators contend that schizophrenics,
and others with borderline psychotic conditions, are more likely
to use the drug intravenously than are other individuals. In one
study, 41 % of those requiring hospital admission for treatment
of amphetamine disorders were thought to be schizophrenic before
taking the drug.100 However, there is still no reliable
information on what proportion of users develop psychoses and
what the predisposing factors actually are. The majority of acute
psychotic reactions occur towards the end of a run, and such
symptoms are usually dissipated by a few days rest. </p>

<p>'Speed freaks' are generally unpopular within the multi-drug
taking community and are often shunned. Consequently, these
individuals may live together in 'flash houses' totally occupied
by amphetamine users. Frequent 'hassles', aggression and violence
have been reported in such dwellings. Heavy users are generally
unable to hold a steady job because of the drug habit and often
have a parasitic relationship with the rest of the illicit
drug-using community. There are reports that many users support
themselves through petty crime.184, 23 </p>

<p>101<i>. High-dose dependency. </i>The question of physical
dependence on amphetamines depends on the definition of the
withdrawal symptoms necessary to meet the criterion. While it is
clear that withdrawing amphetamine from chronic users does not
produce the dramatic, physically painful and often dangerous
abstinence syndrome associated with alcohol, barbiturates, or
opiate narcotics, many investigators feel that the fatigue,
prolonged sleep, brain wave (EEG) changes, voracious appetite,
cardiovascular abnormalities, occasional gastrointestinal cramps,
lethargy and, often, severe emotional depression following the
'speed binge' constitute a physiological reaction analogous to
the more dramatic withdrawal seen with depressant drugs. 56,207 </p>

<p>The tendency for tolerance-producing drugs to manifest a
'rebound' type of physiological and psychological pattern upon
withdrawal has been given considerable attention; amphetamine
abstinence in chronic users is generally characterized by a
profound sedation, and depression of mood and physiological
function, while drugs such as the sedatives and the opiate
narcotics (all of which produce sleep in high doses) generally
exhibit a withdrawal syndrome of severe and toxic overstimulation
(in some instances to the point of convulsions). </p>

<p>The fact that amphetamines have, it any, a physically rather
benign withdrawal syndrome, clearly indicates that a profound
physical dependence is not a necessary component in an overall
severe drug dependency situation. Subjective psychological
factors seem to have considerably greater motivational importance
in many instances - especially with chronic high-dose amphetamine
use. </p>

<p>102.<i> 'Speed Kills'. </i>In recent years, the slogan 'Speed
Kills' has received much attention, and the idea appears to play
a significant role in the attitude that some users and non-users
have towards the drug. One commonly hears the view that once
you're 'on speed' you<b> </b>have only two to five years left to
live. Some chronic 'speed freaks' incorporate this notion into
the identity they present to others and the image they entertain
of themselves. Many observers contend that the chronic use of
intravenous amphetamines reflects a thinly disguised suicidal
tendency, as well as an attention and sympathy gaining device.
'Hello, I'm Philbert Desanex; I'm a speed freak and I'm going to
be dead by fall', is only a slightly exaggerated caricature of
the image purposefully projected by some of these individuals. </p>

<p>103. What is the evidence, in fact, that 'Speed Kills' in the
literal direct physical sense? Fatalities due to acute overdose
are rarely reported. We have no reliable knowledge of the extent
of intravenous amphetamine use, and although we hear many dire
predictions, there is no good information on the long-term
prognosis or outcome of such use. It would certainly appear,
however, that chronic adherence to this practice is most
detrimental to the individual and, often, to those with whom he
interacts. </p>

<p>Although there is no clear evidence that the life expectancy
of 'speed freaks' is lower than others living under similar
circumstances, many investigators suspect this to be so. While
there are few cases in the literature of death directly
attributed to chronic amphetamine use, Clement, Solursh and Van
Ast47 '... have recently become aware of a number of cases of
death on the streets (of Toronto) apparently related to high-dose
amphetamine abuse. At autopsy, however, pathological evidence of
death directly due to amphetamines is rare in such cases'. After
a thorough review of the literature, Cox and Smart of the
Addiction Research Foundation reported: 'Currently there is no
evidence available on mortality rates among speed users and it is
not certain that speed itself is a lethal drug. There is no
evidence to support or deny that &quot;Speed Kills&quot;.60 </p>

<p>The slogan was originally borrowed from a highway traffic
campaign of the last decade and it has been suggested that,
originally, in adopting this phrase, drug users were referring to
the 'death' of the personality, the 'spirit', or the freedom of
the individual when he becomes dependent on amphetamines, rather
than to physical mortality. </p>

<h3>Amphetamines and Other Drugs </h3>

<ol>
    <li>As noted earlier, amphetamines are frequently used in
        conjunction, or in alternation, with a variety of
        depressant drugs such as barbiturates, alcohol and even
        heroin. The barbiturate and amphetamine up-down cycle has
        been described in both youthful and 'respectable' adult
        users at a variety of doses. Amphetamines intensify,
        prolong or otherwise alter the effects of LSD and it is
        reported that the two drugs are sometimes mixed. In
        addition, it would appear that the majority of youthful
        speed users have also had experience with a variety of
        psychedelic and other illicit drugs. Persons dependent on
        the opiate narcotics also frequently make use of
        stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine - either as
        mixtures of drugs or used separately on different
        occasions. It is interesting to note that STP (DOM) and
        the newer MDA, both extremely potent
        psychedelic-hallucinogenic drugs, are chemically closely
        related to amphetamine. </li>

<h2>LSD </h2>

<p> </p>

<p>105. One of the most remarkable and controversial drugs known
today is d-lysergic acid diethylamide-25, better known as LSD or
simply 'acid'. LSD is capable of producing profound and unusual
psychological changes in almost infinitesimal doses, with
relatively little general physiological effect and, along with
other related drugs, has exerted noticeable influence in a
variety of aesthetic, scientific, philosophic, religious and
social areas over the past two decades. LSD is often considered
the prototype of the drug class we have labelled
Psychedelic-Hallucinogens, although there are a great number of
less potent synthetic and naturally occurring substances with
somewhat similar psychopharmacological properties. To date,
almost 3,000 articles on LSD have been published in scientific
journals, although many of these reports do not meet adequate
scientific standards. </p>

<p>106. LSD was developed in 1938 by Hofmann and Stoll, in
Switzerland, as part of a research programme investigating
potential therapeutic uses of certain ergot compounds. LSD is a
semi-synthetic derivative of lysergic acid, an ergot alkaloid
produced by a parasitic fungus, or 'rust', sometimes found on rye
or other grains. Closely related substances are also produced in
the seeds of certain varieties of morning glory. Most ergot
alkaloids are not particularly psychoactive, although some may
have a variety of powerful, and often toxic, physiological
actions, and have been used for centuries for medical purposes. </p>

<p>107. Since LSD appeared to be relatively uninteresting,
physiologically, in animal studies, it received little attention
until Hofmann unwittingly ingested a minute quantity some years
after its original synthesis. He subsequently described his
experience as follows:102 </p>

<p>In the afternoon of 16 April 1943, when I was working on this
problem, I was seized by a peculiar sensation of vertigo and
restlessness. Objects, as well as the shape of my associates in
the laboratory, appeared to undergo optical change. I was unable
to concentrate on my work. In a dreamlike state I left for home,
where an irresistible urge to lie down overcame me. I drew the
curtains and immediately fell into a peculiar state similar to
drunkenness, characterized by an exaggerated imagination. With my
eyes closed, fantastic pictures of extraordinary plasticity and
intensive colour seemed to surge towards me. After two hours this
state gradually wore off. </p>

<p>To confirm his suspicion that LSD was responsible for this
effect, Hofmann investigated further: </p>

<p>However, I decided to get to the root of the matter by taking
a definite quantity of the compound in question. Being a cautious
man, I started my experiment by taking 0.25 mg of d-lysergic acid
diethylamide tartrate, thinking that such an extremely small dose
would surely be harmless, and bearing in mind that the natural
ergot alkaloids produce toxic symptoms in man only with doses
exceeding several milligrams. After 40 minutes I noted the
following symptoms in my laboratory journal: slight giddiness,
restlessness, difficulty in concentration, visual disturbances,
laughing. </p>

<p>And later: </p>

<p>I lost all count of time. I noticed with dismay that my
environment was undergoing progressive changes. My visual field
wavered and everything appeared deformed as in a faulty mirror.
Space and time became more and more disorganized and I was
overcome by a fear that I was going out of my mind. The worst
part of it being that I was clearly aware of my condition. My
power of observation was unimpaired. . . . Occasionally I felt as
if I were out of my body. I thought I had died. My ego seemed
suspended somewhere in space, from where I saw my dead body lying
on the sofa.... It was particularly striking how acoustic
perceptions, such as the noise of water gushing from a tap or the
spoken word, were transformed into optical illusions. I then fell
asleep and awakened the next morning somewhat tired but otherwise
feeling perfectly well. </p>

<p>108. Since various aspects of the experience were thought to
resemble symptoms of naturally occurring schizophrenia, many
investigators became interested in using LSD as a tool for
producing an artificial or 'model psychosis' in the laboratory.
The possibility of gaining insight into psychiatric disorders by
the study of the LSD-induced state stimulated considerable
activity in medical and scientific communities, and the terms <i>psychotomimetic
</i>(psychosis-mimicking) and <i>psychotogenic </i>(psychosis-producing)
were coined. The subsequent discovery that the LSD experience is,
in fact, generally different from natural psychoses has lessened
interest in this aspect of its use. The descriptive label <i>hallucinogenic
</i>(hallucination-producing) has gained wide acceptance, in
spite of the fact that true hallucinations do not commonly occur
with LSD. The term <i>illusinogenic</i> (illusion-producing) is
probably more appropriate. </p>

<p>In the 1950s the exploration of LSD as an aid to psychotherapy
began. Much of the early work, in Canada, investigating the use
of LSD in the treatment of alcoholics, was conducted under the
direction of Dr A. Hoffer at the University of Saskatchewan, In
1957, after reviewing the various descriptive names given LSD and
related drugs, Dr H. Osmond, then Superintendent of the
Saskatchewan Hospital, suggested the terms <i>psycholytic </i>(mind-releasing)
or <i>psychedelic </i>(mind-manifesting) as more appropriate
general labels.174 For various reasons the latter has gained
world-wide usage, although its common application has strayed
considerably from its original context, and it may now denote
general styles of art, fashion and music which are, in some
sense, felt to reflect, enhance, or substitute for the
psychedelic drug experience. </p>

<p>109. While LSD has had a rather short, and somewhat stormy
history, numerous naturally occurring substances with apparently
similar psychological effects have been used in the Western
Hemisphere for centuries. Perhaps the most widely known are
mescaline, from the peyote cactus (lophophora williamsii),
psilocybin, one of the active principles in 'sacred mushrooms'
(teonanactl), and the Mexican morning-glory 'ololiuqui' (Rivea
Corymbosa). In addition, DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and the related
DET (diethyltryptamine) are found in special snuffs used for
centuries by certain South American Indians. Some of these
botanical substances were considered divine by the ancient Aztecs
and played an important role in religious ceremonies long before
the Spanish invaded the land. In spite of the Conquistadors'
attempts to destroy the culture and its historical and religious
underpinnings, the sacramental use of peyote spread to the
Mexican Indians and, later, in the nineteenth century to certain
North American tribes. Today, peyote is used in religious
ceremonies by the Native American Church which has over 200,000
Indian members in Canada and the United States. </p>

<p>110. Until recently, psychedelic drugs received little general
public attention, even though some had been intensively explored
over the past century by various writers, scientists and
'adventurers'. Based on his mescaline experimentation, Aidous
Huxley106 presented, in his twin volumes <i>The Doors of
Perception</i> and<i> Heaven and Hell, </i>one of the most lucid
and perceptive analyses of some of the possible personal,
philosophical and social implications of the psychedelic
experience. </p>

<p>Non-medical interest in LSD and related drugs began to grow
during the 1950s, although such use was apparently largely
restricted to a few professional, academic, and artistic
experimenters. The drug gained continental notoriety in the early
1960s as a result of experimentation by two Harvard University
psychology professors, Drs Alpert and Leary, who invited other
'explorers' to 'Turn on, tune in, and drop out' of the existing
social institutions. Their unorthodox religious orientation to
the LSD experience is presented in <i>The Psychedelic Experience</i>128<i>
</i>(a manual based on the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead), </i>which
became one of the 'bibles' of the psychedelic drug movement.
Another significant influence, with considerably less religious
orientation was writer Ken Kesey's group, the adventures of which
are well documented in <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>
.247 </p>

<p>111. Since 1963, the Canadian Government has controlled the
medical and scientific use of LSD, and in 1969 the possession of
LSD without governmental authorization was made a criminal
offence. Regulation of the legal supply of LSD has apparently had
little effect on 'street' use, however, since essentially all of
the drug so used has come from clandestine laboratories. Although
the constituent chemicals are not readily available and some
sophisticated apparatus is necessary for its proper synthesis,
LSD can be produced by individuals without extensive training in
chemistry. Since it is odourless, colourless and tasteless in
solution, and active in almost invisible quantities, effective
legal control of its transportation, distribution and use has
been extremely difficult. </p>

<p>In recent years, several new synthetic drugs with effects
similar to LSD have appeared on the black market. These include
MDA (alphamethyl-3,4-methylene - dioxyphenethylamine), STP or DOM
(2,5-ditnethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine), and PCP or Sernyl*
(phencyclidine). </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>112. There is currently no widely accepted medical use of LSD,
although it may be employed experimentally for therapeutic
purposes. There have been numerous impressive reports of LSD
successes in the treatment of alcoholics, opiate narcotic
dependents, criminals and various psychiatric patients.101, 129
LSD has also been used with patients dying of cancer, to
alleviate their anxiety and pain, and to help them adjust to the
prospects of death.176 Many of these leads have not been followed
up with adequate scientific investigation, however, and several
recent controlled studies have not substantiated the claim that
LSD adds to the effectiveness of conventional psychotherapy.205 </p>

<p>113. Two basic forms of psychological treatment with LSD have
developed: <i>psycholytic </i>therapy, which uses small or
moderate doses on repeated occasions, sometimes over a period of
several months; and <i>psychedelic </i>therapy which calls for
higher doses and a more profound acute effect and is, as a rule,
given only once or twice. While some investigators claim that
LSD, itself, is more effective than psychotherapy, others claim
that its usefulness is mainly limited to the removal of
therapeutic 'blocks' which may occur at times in the course of
psychotherapy, and still others feel that LSD has no useful
contribution to make to psychiatric treatment. Most clinicians
who have had experience with this form of therapy, stress the
need for a careful selection of patients and for special
qualities and experience in the therapist. </p>

<p>More sophisticated scientific investigations of possible
therapeutic uses of LSD are now underway and may help clarify
some of these issues. It seems justified to say at this time,
however, that the general medical effectiveness of LSD has not
yet been adequately demonstrated. It may well be another decade
before definitive evidence will be available. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>114. LSD is usually taken orally, and may be sniffed in
powdered form or injected in solution. While it is available in
ordinary capsules or tablets, LSD is often impregnated in such
innocuous substances as sugar cubes, candies, biscuits, and cloth
or blotter sections for oral use. It is well absorbed from the
gastro-intestinal tract, is distributed in the blood and easily
diffuses into the brain, and in pregnant females crosses the
placental barrier into the foetus. Although only a tiny portion
actually reaches the central nervous system, LSD is one of the
most potent biologically active substances known and, in some
individuals, exerts a noticeable psychological effect with
quantities as low as 20 to 30 micrograms (millionths of a gram).
Customary doses are usually around 200 mcg and some individuals
have taken up to several thousand micrograms. </p>

<p>Taken orally, LSD effects usually occur within an hour but may
be much faster; response to intramuscular injection usually
appears within ten minutes; and if the intravenous route is used,
the latency may be only a few minutes or less. The duration of
the action depends to a certain extent on the amount taken, and
with a customary dose, major effects usually last 8-12 hours or
more with gradual recovery over a similar period. Essentially all
of the LSD in the body is metabolized into an inactive substance
in the liver and excreted. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Psychological
Effects </h3>

<p>115. The psychological effects of LSD are not readily
predictable, and are determined to a considerable degree by
various personality factors in the individual, his past history
and experiences, his attitudes, expectations, and motivations,
the general setting in which the drug is taken, persons
accompanying the 'trip' and external events occurring during the
experience. While the psychological response is to some extent
dose-related, certain effects appear to be relatively independent
of dose over a considerable range. Increased quantities often
seem to affect the duration more than the intensity or quality of
the 'trip'. </p>

<p>116. Subjective psychological effects of LSD are extremely
difficult to describe and many scientists are quite pessimistic
about the possibility of presenting an objective list of
responses which in any way communicates the essence of the
experience. The intensely personal nature of the effects further
limits description and generalization. Pahnke and Richards177
have described several major types of psychological experience
which have been reported with psychedelic drugs. The outline
presented below is based on, but is not identical to, that
proposed by these researchers. While the list is certainly not
exhaustive and does not describe necessarily discrete or
non-overlapping categories, it provides a convenient basis for
the discussion of LSD effects. It should be noted that not all of
the experiences listed happen in all sessions or in all
individuals, although several may occur in varying degrees, in
sequence or simultaneously, within a 'trip'. </p>

<p>117. First is the <i>psychotic adverse reaction, </i>or
'freak-out' which may be characterized by an intense negative
experience of fear or nightmarish terror to the point of panic,
complete loss of emotional control, paranoid delusions,
hallucinations, catatonic features, and, perhaps, profound
depression and sense of meaninglessness. Such states are usually
acute, although pro1onged reactions have been noted. </p>

<p>118. Second is the <i>non-psychotic adverse reaction </i>in
which the person may experience varying degrees of tension,
anxiety and fear, unpleasant illusions, depression and despair.
Inappropriate or disordered social behaviour may occur. This kind
of reaction may differ from the first in the intensity of the
experience and in the degree of control and 'reality contact'
expressed by the individual. Such unpleasant experiences are
commonly labelled 'bad trips' or 'bummers'. </p>

<p>119. Third is the <i>psychodynamic psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by a dramatic emergence into consciousness of material which had
previously been unconscious or suppressed. Strong emotional
feelings can accompany what may be experienced subjectively as a
reliving of incidents from the past or a symbolic portrayal of
important conflicts. Such effects are often sought in LSD
psychotherapy. </p>

<p>120. Fourth is the <i>cognitive psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by an impression of astonishingly lucid thought. Problems may be
seen from a novel perspective and the interrelationships of many
levels of meaning and dimensions may be sensed simultaneously.
The relationship between this experience and naturally occurring
insight and creativity has been the subject of considerable
interest and speculation. </p>

<p>121. Fifth is the <i>aesthetic psychedelic experience </i>characterized
by a change and intensification of all sensory impressions, with
vision often most affected. Fascinating alteration in sensation
and perception may occur; <i>synaesthesia </i>or crossing-over of
sensory modalities may be produced (music and other sounds may be
'seen'); objects such as flowers or stones may appear to pulsate
or 'become alive'; ordinary things may seem imbued with great
beauty; music may take on an incredible emotional power; and
visions of beautiful colours, intricate geometric patterns,
architectural forms, landscapes and 'almost anything imaginable'
may occur. </p>

<p>122. The sixth type of psychedelic experience has been called
by such names as <i>psychedelic-peak, cosmic, transcendental, or
mystical. </i>Some of the psychological phenomena which are said
to characterize this experience, are: a sense of unity or 'cosmic
oneness' with the universe; a feeling of transcendence of time
and space; a deeply felt positive mood of joy, blessedness, love,
and peace; a sense of sacredness,<b> </b>awe and, wonder; a
feeling of profound theological or religious awareness; a feeling
of insight into reality at an intuitive, nonrational level; an
awareness of things which seem logically contradictory and
paradoxical; and a belief that the experience is beyond words,
non-verbal and impossible to describe. The full peak experience,
in its entirety, does not occur in the majority of individuals,
is usually transient, and does not last for long in its full
intensity, although it may have persisting effects on attitudes
and behaviour. </p>

<p>123. With few exceptions, little general information can be
given as to the relative frequency of occurrence of these various
types of psychedelic drug reaction, since the response is largely
determined by such variable factors as the particular individual
involved, his set and the setting. As is often the case in
science, techniques designed to measure the effects of LSD may
greatly influence or distort the phenomenon under study.
Savage198 has pointed out that unless the LSD experience takes
place '. . .<b> </b>in a secure setting, with sufficient
emotional support where S (the subject) feels safe to encounter
the bizarre and often powerful manifestations of his own mind
unharassed by tests, interpretations, and the coldly precise
scientific analytic attitudes, the only result can be confusion
and paranoia'. </p>

<p>Reports of 'objective' study of LSD's subjective effects
considerably in content and often appear to be as much a function
of the individual scientist's conceptual orientation and
experimental methods as they are of the subjects and the drug
itself. Some researchers report that LSD experiences in their
subjects, are definitely unpleasant and anxiety-ridden, and that
subsequent sessions are uniformly avoided, while other scientists
claim that anxiety is infrequent and that subjects generally
enjoy the sessions and are eager to participate further.228
Experiences in non-supervised and indiscriminate settings are
undoubtedly even more variable. </p>

<p>124. It is generally reported that LSD has deleterious effects
on performance in tests requiring a high degree of attention,
concentration or motivation. It is often difficult to get
meaningful data from such measurements, since subjects frequently
become engrossed in the subjective aspects of the drug experience
and lose interest in the tasks presented by the investigators.
Psychological tests are often seen as absurd or irrelevant by the
subjects. Performance on standard tests of intelligence,
learning, memory and other cognitive functions, as well as
certain psychomotor tasks generally show impairment and sometimes
lack of change and, rarely, improvement.205 Certain types of
conduct by some persons under the influence of LSD indicate gross
impairment of judgement. Recall of events occurring during the
drug experience is generally good, however. Effects on driving
skills have not been systematically investigated, although
available related data, and reports by users, as well as certain
eye witness accounts, suggest that driving ability is usually
drastically reduced by the acute effects of LSD. There is no
evidence that the drug has been a significant factor in
automobile accidents, however. </p>

<p>True hallucinations, where false sensory signals are believed
to be physically real, are rarely reported, although
pseudohallucinations and other perceptual distortions and
illusions are frequently noted. One of the most uniformly cited
and significant subjective effects is the alteration of ordinary
temporal perception, or time-sense. Moments may seem like hours,
and time may seem to be transcended. Pleasant experiences may
extend indefinitely or, on the other hand, bad trips can become
an interminable horror. </p>

<p>125. Current arguments as to whether LSD is truly
'consciousness-expanding' as its proponents contend or
'consciousness-constricting' as its opponents assert, will
probably not be resolved by science in the near future, since it
seems unlikely that such hypotheses can be put to adequate
empirical test given the current state of technology. </p>

<p>Contentions are often made that LSD can elicit new levels of
spontaneity, insight, problem-solving and creativity.214 These
claims are very difficult to assess, since the effects described
are often highly subjective and personal, and are hardly amenable
to empirical validation. The problems of studying creativity in
the laboratory are considerable, and little is known of the basic
psychology of such cognitive processes. A generally agreed upon
definition of the concept of creativity has eluded investigators
so far, and few meaningful tests are available. Studies of the
effects of psychedelic drugs on allegedly creativity-related
behaviours have produced inconsistent results. Often performance
does not reflect the subjective impressions of the drug
experience. Although sophisticated scientific investigation in
this area is only just beginning, it is already obvious that LSD
will not perform the miracle of turning an uninspired and
untalented individual into a creative genius. The question of
more subtle effects on creative activity in certain individuals
must be answered by future research. </p>

<p>126. Most authorities agree that LSD does not have a specific
aphrodisiac or sex-drive stimulating effect. Some users indicate
an enhanced appreciation of sexual experience, while many others
report a total disinterest in sex while on a 'trip'. Some
increase in sexual behaviour may occur as a result of a lessening
of inhibitions and an increase in emotionality, tactile
appreciation, and interpersonal contact. LSD has been used in the
treatment of sexual disorders of psychological origin (e.g.
frigidity and impotence) although its general usefulness has not
been clearly demonstrated in this area. </p>

<p>127. An LSD-induced 'bad trip' may range from a mildly
negative or ambivalent experience to an episode of intense terror
and nightmarish panic. Such adverse reactions often seem to focus
on the fear of death, fear of permanent insanity, basic sexual
conflicts, and fear of legal repercussions in illicit users, or
may be precipitated by an objective 'hassle' or problem of real
or imagined significance. Under the influence of LSD, it is often
difficult to cope with immediate problems which arise, and
emotional vulnerability may be increased. 'Bad trips' seem to
occur most often when the individual is poorly prepared, alone,
or in an otherwise unprotected or unsupervised setting. While an
experienced 'guide' or therapist can often help prevent or
alleviate negative reactions, this is no guarantee against an
unpleasant experience. Neither are earlier positive experiences -
severe 'bad trips' have been noted in individuals who had
previous long histories of unequivocally pleasant psychedelic
experiences. Certain tranquillizers can be of assistance in
reducing the unpleasantness of the experience, often by
terminating the drug effect<b> </b>non-chemical, personal
supportive guidance is most important in treating negative
reactions. </p>

<p>Although most negative LSD experiences appear to be of short
duration, prolonged psychotic episodes lasting months or even
years have been elicited by LSD.50 Many investigators contend
that such extreme experiences occur only in individuals already
predisposed to psychotic reaction, and are simply precipitated by
the stress of a 'bad trip'. On the other hand, numerous examples
have occurred in persons without obvious prior pathology, and it
would appear that there is no satisfactory method for predicting
who might suffer a serious adverse reaction. </p>

<p>128. Prolonged psychoses are quite rare in clinical or
experimental settings, even when psychiatric patients are used as<b>
</b>subjects. Cohen49 surveyed 44 investigators who had given LSD
or mescaline to approximately 5,000 persons a total of about
25,000 times, and found that psychotic reactions lasting over 48
hours occurred in 0.18 per cent of the psychiatric patients
studied and 0.08 per cent of the experimental subjects. There
were four suicides in the patients, all occurring months after
the LSD experience, and none among the experimental subjects.
Whether these deaths can be attributed to LSD use is not certain.
Similar incidents of adverse reaction under controlled
circumstances have been reported by others and the use of LSD in
medically supervised settings has been considered by many
investigators to be comparatively safe from a psychiatric point
of view.65, 132 </p>

<p>These findings do not provide a<b> </b>satisfactory basis for
estimating the effects of illicit use, however, since set,
setting, purity and quantity of drug, and consequently, the
quality of the trip, are all apt to be quite different in these
situations. The frequency of bad trips among street LSD users is
unknown, although many such cases have come to the attention of
medical authorities and certainly cannot be considered uncommon.
Solursh2l3 reports that in one series of street users studied
retrospectively, 'freak-outs' occurred in 24 of 601 'acid trips',
Furthermore, impressionistic accounts from individuals in close
contact with the 'drug-scene' suggest that the incidence of 'bad
trips' is steadily increasing. Ungerleider229 studied 70
individuals who required hospitalization in a Los Angeles Medical
centre after illicit LSD use. One-third of these admissions were
diagnosed psychotic and two-thirds were hospitalized for more
than a month. </p>

<p>129. Usually neither the therapist nor the patient is certain
as to the identity, purity or quantity of the drug involved in
'street' cases and records are further complicated by the fact
that there is considerable discrepancy among reporters as to what
exactly constitutes an adverse reaction. Furthermore, it would
appear that many 'bad trips' are treated by friends and never
come to the attention of the medical authorities. In addition to
personal support and assistance in these situations,
tranquillizers (and niacinamide) are available legally and on the
black market for such emergencies. Even if some accurate estimate
could be made of the number of negative reactions occurring, it
would not be possible to assess the relative significance of the
figures, since we have little idea as to the overall frequency of
illicit LSD use in the general population. </p>

<p>130. Illicit users of LSD commonly voice the opinion that bad
trips are caused by bad drugs and that 'pure acid' is relatively
free from adverse reactions. These claims are rarely based on
chemical analysis, and although contaminants and other drugs
reported to appear in black market LSD can undoubtedly affect the
experience, it is uncertain what proportion of the negative
reactions can be accounted for by contaminants. It is certain
that well-documented 'freak-outs' have occurred with clinically
pure LSD. </p>

<p>131. Although suicide may be rare among illicit as well as
medically supervised LSD users, a few cases have been documented.
Attempts at self-mutilation have also been reported on rare
occasions. Accidental deaths are somewhat more common and a
number of cases of fatality or serious injury have been noted as
a result of a loss of critical judgement or attentional
processes. For example, some individuals have jumped from
buildings or trees apparently under the delusion that they could
fly<b> </b>or were indestructible. Stories of numerous persons
who had become permanently blind while staring at the sun during
LSD trips were generated by a state official in the United States
and widely circulated in the public media. These reports were
subsequently shown to be a hoax and no such cases are on
record.170'b' </p>

<p>132. Although fear, panic and aggression may result from a
'freak-out', homicides associated with LSD use are rare and only
a few have been documented. Reports of violence occurring while
under the influence of LSD have generally not been supported,78
although there may be some significant exceptions. The majority
of non-drug arrests associated with LSD use seem to be in the
order of 'disturbance of the peace' offences and there is little
evidence that LSD plays a significant role in major crimes. </p>

<p>Recurrence of certain aspects of LSD experiences ('flashbacks'
or 'echoes') of varying duration and intensity have been reported
over periods ranging from a few months to more than a year after
last (or only) LSD use.189 The quality of these experiences,
which usually last only a few minutes or less, may depend on as
many factors as the original trip. They may be triggered or
precipitated by seemingly irrelevant stimuli or events, by other
drugs, or may appear spontaneously. We have no good information
as to frequency of these recurrences, although they appear to
occur most often in heavy users and could clearly be unpleasant
or dangerous in certain circumstances. </p>

<p>133. The possible religious significance of psychedelic drug
experiences has been the subject of heated controversy for
centuries. While many authorities have pointed out basic
similarities between drug-induced feelings of transcendental or
mystical awareness and the <i>satori or kensho </i>of Zen
Buddhism, <i>the samadhi </i>of Hinduism or the <i>beatific
vision </i>of Christianity, others have been outraged<b> </b>by
the suggestion that such 'instant mysticism' could be produced
chemically. It is quite apparent, however, that a considerable
degree of religiosity has pervaded the psychedelic drug movement
of the 1960s and has played a major role in the use of such drugs
in other cultures. </p>

<p>The major theoretical positions and scientific research in
this area have been reviewed by several investigators208, l47 and
these reports provide experimental support for the notion that
drug-evoked experiences may have religious significance for
certain individuals. Perhaps the most rigorous scientific
evidence comes from Pahnke's175 controlled psilocybin experiment
with seminary graduate students conducted in the setting of a
Good Friday religious service. He notes that: 'Those subjects who
received psilocybin experienced phenomena which were
indistinguishable from, if not identical with, the categories
defined by our typology of mysticism.' The religious aspects of
the psychedelic experience apparently depend a great deal on the
individual, his values and expectations, and the setting
involved, and do not normally occur with great intensity in most
persons or in most situations. Masters and Houstonl47 report that
6 out of 206 of their subjects attained a mystical experience,
while other researchers report no such events and still others, a
much higher incidence. Differences in semantic meaning,
definition and criteria may account for part of these
discrepancies. The 'objective validity' of drug-elicited
religious experiences, however, is by nature untestable in the
scientific sense, and the area will doubtless remain in a storm
of controversy. </p>

<p>134. Numerous claims have been made by various LSD users,
psychotherapists and scientists that LSD can produce long-lasting
beneficial effects on personality and behaviour. On the other
hand, many observers feel that chronic use of LSD may result in a
lessening of work output and a deterioration of social behaviour,
a general 'amotivational syndrome' in some individuals. Both
types of allegation are difficult to evaluate, since few
adequately controlled investigations have been done on the
long-term effects of either medically supervised or non-medical
LSD use. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>135. LSD exerts its most significant physiological effects on
and through the central nervous system, although the exact
mechanism by which this occurs is not yet known. As a result of
its potent general arousal or activation capacity. LSD may
produce a variety of autonomic nervous system (sympathomimetic)
actions, considered to be of little clinical significance at
normal doses. Commonly reported are: widened pupils, increased
heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, increased body
temperature, chills, increased blood sugar level, 'goose
pimples', flushing of the facial skin, increased urination,
headache, and rarely nausea and vomiting. It generally increases
the activation of the brain (as indicated by the EEG), produces
alertness, blocks sleep, decreases appetite, may induce tremors
and reduce coordination, changes respiration patterns, and
facilitates certain simple reflexes.138 In a few instances
convulsions have occurred. LSD has remarkably low physiological
toxicity and, to date, no human deaths have been reported due to
overdose. Although the evidence is not clear, psychological
indications of minor brain damage may be present in chronic heavy
users of LSD.152 </p>

<p>l36. In the past few years, considerable controversy and
sensational publicity has arisen around the possibility that LSD
may affect hereditary transmission through chromosomal
alterations, produce changes in white blood cells resembling
leukemia and adversely affect the developing human focus.48
Relevant studies involving test-tube preparations of human live
animal and insect experiments, and examinations of illicit LSD
users, have been contradictory to date and provide no clear
answers to these important questions.105 The relationship between
<i>in vitro </i>(test-tube) and <i>in vivo </i>(living organism)
effects is rarely straightforward, and generalizations from one
species to another are difficult. Furthermore, studying the users
of 'street' drugs gives little information regarding specific
compounds, since such individuals may use a variety of drugs and
neither the investigator nor the subject can be sure of the
purity, quantity or identity of substances obtained from the
illicit market. In the few controlled studies in which
chromosomes were examined in humans before and after clinically
supervised administration of known doses of pure LSD, little
evidence of significant change was noted.125,58 The effects of
prolonged regular use of LSD have not been carefully
investigated, however, and the presence or absence of alterations
under such conditions can not be completely predicted on the
basis of present information. </p>

<p>Research in this area is complicated by the fact that
temporary or permanent chromosome breakage is not an uncommon
response to a variety of non-drug experiences, and can be
produced by nuclear radioactivity, many pollutants, X-rays, fever
and a number of virus infections. Furthermore, there is evidence
that such frequently used drugs as caffeine and aspirin may cause
chromosome breaks in certain cells.122 It should be noted that
chromosome damage <i>per se </i>does not necessarily affect
either the individual or his offspring, although the possibility
must be considered. </p>

<p>137. High doses of LSD administered at certain times early in
pregnancy have been shown to produce deformities in the offspring
of some animal species and not others. No unequivocal evidence of
such teratogenic LSD effects in humans has been reported,
although there have been a few widely publicized instances of
abnormalities in babies born of mothers who had used LSD. Whether
such anomalies occur more frequently in LSD users than in the
normal population is uncertain. Most investigators feel that the
possibility of chromosome or foetal damage in humans forbids the
use of LSD for either medical or non-medical purposes, by women
who are either pregnant or expect to become so in the near
future. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>138. Tolerance to the psychological and physiological effects
of LSD develops on repeated use, although the form of
psychological tolerance is unusual in several respects. Tolerance
to most drugs can be overcome and effects of full intensity
obtained by simply increasing dosage. With LSD, often a period of
three or four days or longer must separate 'trips' if the full
effects are to be obtained, regardless of dose. A second unusual
quality of LSD tolerance is the rapidity with which it develops
and dissipates. A reduction in effects may occur after only one
or two consecutive administrations. Furthermore, when LSD is used
intermittently many users report, a 'reverse' tolerance, or
increased sensitivity to the drug and may, after experience, use
less to achieve the desired effects. These factors suggest that
the pharmacological mechanism underlying LSD tolerance may be
quite different from those seen with most other psychoactive
drugs. </p>

<p>139. Physical dependence does not develop to LSD, even in
cases in which the drug has been used more than two hundred times
in a single year.51 Psychological dependence has been reported to
occur in certain individuals who become preoccupied with the drug
experience and feel emotionally depressed and unsatisfied without
it. Normally, however, LSD use is intermittent and periods of
weeks or months may separate 'trips' in even 'confirmed' users, </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">LSD
and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>140. It appears that many LSD users will also experiment with
other psychedelic drugs. Cross-tolerance occurs among some of
these substances and an individual who has recently taken LSD
will generally show reduced response to mescaline and psilocybin,
but not to cannabis or phencyclidine (PCP). It should be noted
that mescaline and psilocybin are rarely found in Canada and no
such black market samples have been verified by chemical
analysis. </p>

<p>Other drugs, such as atropine or amphetamines, are reported to
be sometimes added to LSD to intensify, prolong or otherwise
alter the experience. Strychnine (a stimulant once commonly used
in medical practice) is rumoured to have also been employed for
such effects. In spite of such stories, black market products
purported to contain mixtures of LSD and other drugs have rarely
been found on analysis to be as represented. Such combinations
appear to be infrequent in Canada. Unsuccessful attempts at LSD
synthesis may produce a variety of other ergot alkaloids with
possibly unpleasant or dangerous pharmacological properties in
high doses. Samples of such concoctions have been obtained from
black market sources.144 </p>

<p>Chlorpromazine (Largactil*), a major tranquillizer, usually
blocks LSD effects, although in rare instances it paradoxically
potentiates the original drug response. In addition certain
sedatives and niacinamide (nicotinamide) may also reduce some of
the effects of LSD. </p>

<h2>CANNABIS </h2>

<p> </p>

<p>141.<i> Cannabis sativa </i>is an herbaceous annual plant
which readily grows untended in temperate climates in many areas
of the world, including Canada. Although there are several
varieties (i.e. indica, americana, and africana) most botanists
consider these to be members of the same species. Indian hemp, as
this plant is sometimes known, has separate male and female forms
and may grow to 10 to 12 feet under favourable conditions. </p>

<p>The first detailed description of cannabis available today
appeared in a medicinal book prepared by the Chinese Emperor Shen
Nung around 2737 B.C. Since then, cannabis has been known in the
East by such descriptions as 'the heavenly guide', 'Poor man's
heaven', 'soother of grief' and, in a more moralistic tone, 'the
liberator of sin'.223 A United Nations' report 20 years ago
estimated that 200 million people in the world used the drug for
medical, religious or recreational purposes. </p>

<p>142. What is commonly referred to as marijuana ('grass',
'pot', 'weed', 'tea', 'boo' or 'Mary Jane') in North America is
usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often
twigs, and may vary considerably in potency from one sample to
another. Similar preparations are known as <i>bhang </i>and the
more potent <i>ganja </i>in India, <i>kif </i>in Morocco and <i>dagga
</i>in Africa, while the relatively pure resin is called <i>hashish
</i>('hash') in the West and much of the Middle East, and <i>charas
</i>in India. Hashish is usually prepared by pressing or scraping
the sticky amber resin from the plant, and may be more than five
times as potent on a weight basis as high quality marijuana. In
addition to these common forms, concentrated cannabis extract is
available in some countries in an alcohol solution (tincture of
Cannabis) designed for medical purposes (e.g., British
Pharmacopoeia). </p>

<p>The various forms of the drug are frequently listed under the
general term cannabis since they differ primarily in the degree
of potency. It must be stressed, however; that differences in the
preparation, quantities involved, mode of administration and
patterns of use are also important determinants of effect, and it
is often essential that these factors be identified in the
examination of individual reports. </p>

<p>143. In many societies, <i>cannabis sativa </i>has been a
highly valued crop. The trunk fibres of the woody plant are used
in the reduction of hemp rope and twine; the seeds are a source
of a product similar to linseed oil and, until recently, were
also commonly used as bird food; the pharmacological properties
of the leaves, flowers and resin have been used for thousands of
years, for both medical and non-medical purposes. </p>

<p>Cannabis was apparently brought to the Western hemisphere in
the sixteenth century by the Spaniards and was an important fibre
and seed crop centuries later in the British colonies of North
America. A portion of George Washington's Mount Vernon plantation
was dedicated to the cultivation of hemp and it was reported
that, 'Virginia awarded bounties for hemp culture and
manufacture, and imposed penalties on those who did not produce
it.'31 Although there are conflicting opinions, it would appear
that the psychotropic properties of cannabis may have been little
known to the colonial farmers at that time.12,120 Hemp was again
cultivated in North America during World War II after the major
supply lines from the East were cut off. These plants were
apparently selected for high fibre content and low
pharmacological activity. </p>

<p>144. When grown under optimal conditions almost all parts of
both male and females plants, may be potentially psychoactive.
The female has traditionally been considered the more efficient
producer of the resin responsible for the pharmacological
effects, although recent studies question this conclusion.235
Female flowers, prior to pollination, contain the greatest
concentration of resin and, consequently, the flowering tops are
highly valued and are frequently prepared separately from the
remainder of the plant. The potency is further affected by the
climate and soil conditions, certain genetic factors, and the
time and method of harvesting and preparation. </p>

<p>145. In recent years, the chemistry of cannabis has come under
careful investigation. Although numerous cannabinols were
considered potential candidates in the search for the active
principles of cannabis, it appears that certain forms of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most potent psychoactive
constituents. Several of these have recently been isolated and
synthesized.155 It would be incorrect to say, however, that the
active ingredient in cannabis has been established, since much
basic psychopharmacological work remains to be done in this area.
Several related synthetics (Synhexyl* or Pyrahexyl*) have also
been investigated. Although there are continual reports of THC
being sold on the illicit market, samples alleged to be THC have
invariably been found to be some other drug. </p>

<p>146. Frequent cases of cannabis use first came to the regular
attention of government and public health officials in North
America after World War I, although earlier references to such
use exist. This increase was correlated with an influx of Mexican
workers into the Southern United States, and subsequent use was
apparently largely confined to ethnic minority groups, with a
high proportion of urban-dwelling Afro- and Spanish-Americans
among the known users. In addition, cannabis use was often noted
among musicians and others in the fields of entertainment and
creative arts. In the last decade, however, the use of cannabis
has spread to quite a different segment of the population and
appears to be most prevalent among, although by no means
restricted to, middle-class youth of high school and college age.
In spite of the risk of severe penalties, estimates based on a
variety of sources suggest that eight to 20 million North
Americans have at least tried cannabis.260 These figures must be
considered tenuous however, since there is no satisfactory way to
assess their validity. </p>

<p>147. Recently the controversy surrounding this drug has
reached epidemic proportions. Usually reliable authorities have
publicly taken diametrically opposed positions regarding
cannabis, not only on moral and social policy issues, but on the
supposedly 'hard' scientific facts as well. Although the current
world literature on cannabis numbers some 2,000 publications, few
of these papers meet modern standards of scientific
investigation. They are often ill-documented and ambiguous,
emotion-laden and incredibly biased, and can, in general, be
relied upon for very little valid information. Scientific
expertise in the area of cannabis is limited by the simple fact
that there is little clearly-established scientific information
available, and preconceived notions often dominate the
interpretation of ambiguous data. The resulting confusion is
exemplified by current legislation in many parts of the world,
including Canada and the United States, which classifies cannabis
with the opiate narcotics, even though these drugs are
pharmacologically different. </p>

<p>This rather sorry state of affairs can be attributed to
several factors. To begin with, governmental restrictions on the
medical and scientific use of cannabis in North America have been
so strict over the past few decades that the majority of would-be
researchers have found it more attractive to work in other areas.
Secondly, since the widespread use of cannabis in North America
is a relatively new phenomenon, it has not, in the past, been
considered a particularly high priority research area from a
public health standpoint. In addition, until recently, there was
little possibility of standardizing the cannabis substances being
studied, since little was known about the relevant aspects of
cannabis chemistry. Consequently, there was little basis for
comparing reports, and generalizations were limited. To date, no
authorized experimental research of cannabis effects on humans is
being conducted in Canada. </p>

<p>The observations collected during centuries of relatively
unrestricted cannabis use in regions of the East have rarely been
scientifically documented because most of what we consider modern
science has been, until recently, basically a Western phenomenon.
Furthermore, profound cultural, moral and legal differences
complicate the problem of extrapolating from reports of Eastern
usage to the North American scene. </p>

<p>While there has been a concerted effort, in the following
discussions of cannabis effects, to concentrate attention on
fairly well documented topics and to avoid areas where the
evidence is especially weak, the scanty nature of our current
scientific knowledge of cannabis necessitates a cautious and
tentative approach to this interim review. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>148. There is no currently accepted medical use of cannabis in
North America outside of an experimental context. Although
cannabis has been reported to produce an array of possibly useful
medical effects, these have either not been adequately
investigated, or can be replaced by using other more readily
available and convenient drugs. The natural product's variability
in potency and instability over time are among the factors which
have led to its disfavour in Western 20th century medicine.
However, recent advances in isolation and synthesis of certain
active principles of cannabis have prompted a second look at some
of the potentially therapeutic aspects of the drug.159 </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used in the past, is presently used in some
cultures, or is currently under clinical investigation, for its
alleged anxiety-reducing, tranquillizing, mood-elevating,
appetite stimulating, analgesic (pain reducing) and
anti-bacterial effects. It has also been used to reduce fatigue
or insomnia (sleeplessness), to ease opiate narcotic withdrawal,
and as an aid to psychotherapy in applications analogous to <i>psycholytic</i>
LSD therapy or as a clinical antidepressant. In addition,
cannabis has often been employed in the past, and is currently
used illicitly in North America, to reduce the secondary symptoms
and suffering caused by the flu and the common cold. These
various alleged therapeutic properties of cannabis have not been
adequately studied in a scientific context, and their general
medical potential remains a matter of conjecture. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>149. Marijuana is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes
known as 'joints', 'J's', 'sticks' or 'reefers', the butt of
which is often called a 'roach'. Normally one or two joints is
sufficient to produce a mild 'high', although this varies
considerably according to individual factors and the potency of
the sample. Hashish may vary in colour from very light to
dark-brown and ranges from a hard waxy substance to a crumbly,
powdery consistency. Small pieces of hashish may be placed on the
tip of a burning tobacco cigarette and the smoke inhaled off the
top. Ordinary pipes, water pipes (hookahs) and a variety of
specially made instruments are also employed in the smoking of
hashish and marijuana. </p>

<p>In the Middle East and Far East cannabis is often mixed with
such substances as <i>datura stramonium </i>(Jimson weed),
tobacco, <i>nux vomica, </i>and opium, which further complicates
the interpretation of reports from these areas.107 Samples of
cannabis obtained in Canada generally do not contain other drugs,
although they may be 'cut' with relatively inert substances.143
There have been no analytical reports to support rumours that
heroin or other opiate narcotics have been found in cannabis in
this country. </p>

<p>150. Cannabis smoke is usually inhaled deep into the lungs and
held there for an extended time, in order to increase absorption.
The onset of psychological effects is almost immediate with the
smoking of more potent forms of cannabis, and the peak effects
usually occur within the first quarter-hour following
inhalations. Major effects usually last several hours while
milder ones may endure for half a day longer. </p>

<p>Absorption by the gastro-intestinal tract is effective,
although relatively slow. Since the resin is fairly soluble in
hot water, cannabis is often used in making tea or other
beverages - mild <i>bhang </i>drinks, for example, are common in
India. In some countries hashish is incorporated into buttered
candies called <i>majoon, </i>or other foods. The effects of
cannabis taken orally usually begin after an hour or so, and
gradually reach a peak within several hours, then slowly decline.
Very high doses may produce some effects lasting more than a day,
although the drug is not ordinarily used in such large quantities
in North America. The effects of oral administration are often
noticeably different from those of inhalation. It is uncertain
whether this is due to chemical changes from the heat in the
smoked material, effects of the digestive juices or other
metabolic enzymes after oral administration, or differences in
rapidity and efficiency of absorption and distribution in the two
methods. On a weight basis, however, smoking seems to be the most
effective mode of administration. The speed of acquisition, the
duration of effects, and the recovery from the cannabis 'high'
depends on the rate, quantity, and mode of administration, in
addition to various psychological and physiological
characteristics of the user. </p>

<p>151. While considerable progress is being made in this area,
little is known at the present time regarding the metabolism,
excretion, and mechanism of action of cannabis. There is evidence
that some metabolites of THC are psychoactive. Techniques are
being developed which are designed to measure cannabis products
in the urine, blood and saliva, and substantial breakthroughs are
expected in these areas in the near future. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Effects
of Cannabis </h3>

<p>152. Although the literature is brimming with impressionistic
reports of the effects of cannabis, only a small number of these
meet even the most rudimentary scientific standards. A review of
those effects which have been unequivocally established and
scientifically documented would be a scant summary indeed. In
spite of strong disagreement among extremists on many points in
the cannabis controversy, major governmental reports by
independent- commissions of various backgrounds over
three-quarters of a century have come to some surprisingly
similar conclusions regarding the use of cannabis. Such reports
include the British <i>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report
(1893-4),</i>107 Mayor La Guardia's Report on <i>The Marijuana
Problem in The City of New York </i>(1944),149 the United States
President's Commission on <i>Law Enforcement</i> <i>and
Administration of Justice: Task Force on Narcotics and Drug Abuse
</i>(1967),220 and the <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968), by the
British Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence, prepared under the
chairmanship of the Baroness Wootton of Abinger.5 </p>

<p>In many areas in which formal scientific data are not
available, we shall have to rely on expert opinion, and in such
instances reference will be made to some of the observations
presented in these aforementioned governmental reports. A general
overview of the effects of cannabis will be followed by a more
detailed examination of certain selected scientific studies.
Primary concern will be given to recent publications. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Overview
of Effects </h3>

<p>153.<i> Physiological</i> <i>Effects. </i>The short-term
physiological effects of cannabis are usually slight and
apparently have little clinical significance. The following
effects have been established in adequately controlled studies:
increase in heart rate, swelling of the minor conjunctival blood
vessels in the membranes around the eye, and minor unspecific
changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Also commonly noted,
but less well documented, are: a slight drying of the eyes and
nasal passages, initially stimulated salivation followed by
dryness of the mouth, throat irritation and coughing during
smoking, and increased urination. Less commonly, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation are reported. These
gastro-intestinal disturbances rarely occur with smoked cannabis,
although nausea is not uncommon when large quantities are taken
orally. Changes in blood sugar level and blood pressure have been
inconsistently reported. Appetite is usually stimulated. Contrary
to popular belief, there is little evidence of pupil dilation. In
some individuals, incoordination, ataxia and tremors have been
observed and chest pains, dizziness and fainting have
occasionally been noted, usually at high doses. Physiological
hangover effects have been described but are rare, even after
considerable intoxication. </p>

<p>154. Cannabis has little acute physiological toxicity - sleep
is the usual somatic consequence of over-dose. No deaths due
directly to smoking or eating of cannabis have been documented
and no reliable information exists regarding the lethal dose in
humans. One fatality, however, was reportedly caused by
distention of the bowel during a prolonged bout of gross
over-eating under the acute influence of cannabis.134 </p>

<p>155. There is little reliable information on the long-term
effects of cannabis use. There are numerous reports from Eastern
countries of chronic ill-health among very heavy long-term users
of hashish. Most commonly reported are minor respiratory and
gastro-intestinal ailments. These studies rarely provide a
control group of comparable non-users for a reference standard,
and clinical findings are usually confounded with a variety, of
social, economic and cultural factors which are not easily
untangled. Consequently, much important work remains to be done
in this area. The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states: 5
</p>

<p>Having reviewed all the material available to us, we find
ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the Government of India
(1893-1894) and the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana
(1944), that the long-term consumption of cannabis in <i>moderate
</i>doses has no harmful effects. </p>

<p>156. Some observers have suggested that chronic smoking of
cannabis might produce carcinogenic effects similar to those now
attributed to the smoking of tobacco, although no evidence exists
to support this view at this time. A meaningful comparison is
difficult to make since the quantity of leaf consumed by the
average cigarette smoker in North America is many times the
amount of cannabis smoked by even heavy users. The present
pattern of use by regular cannabis smokers in North America is
more analogous to intermittent alcohol use (e.g., once or twice a
week), than to the picture of chronic daily use presented by
ordinary tobacco dependence. However, the deep inhalation
technique usually used with cannabis might add respiratory
complications. </p>

<p>157. Recently, there have been conflicting reports that large
quantities of cannabis extract, injected into pregnant females of
certain strains of rodents, may cause abnormalities in the
offspring.85 These disparate results can not be simply
extrapolated to humans and at this time there is no scientific
evidence that cannabis adversely affects human chromosomes or
causes deformed children. </p>

<p>158.<i> Psychological Effects</i>.<i> </i>The psychological
effects of cannabis vary greatly with a number of factors and are
often difficult to predict. The dose, type of preparation, and
rate and mode of administration can greatly influence the
response, even if the effective doses and peak responses are made
comparable. Furthermore, the psychological effects depend to a
considerable degree on the personality of the user, his past
experience with cannabis or other drugs, his attitudes, and the
setting in which the drug is used. </p>

<p>Although 'hash' may be many times more potent than marijuana,
the effects of these two forms of cannabis, as usually used in
North America, are often indistinguishable. It has been reported
that most experienced individuals smoke to attain a certain
effect or level of 'high', and adjust the dose according to the
potency of the substance used. 'Grass' and 'hash' are generally
used interchangeably and great variations in potency of different
samples are accommodated by the experienced user through a
'titration' of dose - i.e., intake is stopped when the smoker
reaches a personally comfortable level of intoxication. Such
precision is generally not possible with oral use, however, due
to the long delay in action, and a 'non-optimal' effect is
therefore much more likely to occur with this practice. In some
Eastern countries, different social norms have evolved around the
different forms of cannabis, and the pattern of drug use
associated with bhang drinks may be quite different from that
seen in regular hashish users. Long-term heavy cannabis users
invariably prefer the more potent ganja or hashish.45, 107 </p>

<p>It is often difficult to find descriptions of the
psychological affects of marijuana that are free from value
judgements. Many effects seem to take on good or bad connotations
depending on the circumstances in which they occur, the personal
attitudes of the individual undergoing the experience, and the
orientation of the observer who is recording them. Moreover,
since many of the significant psychological effects are intensely
personal, the laboratory scientist often has little opportunity
to make objective measurements, and must rely on subjective,
introspective reports, communicated verbally through a language
system which is frequently inadequate. </p>

<p>159. Cannabis is one of the least potent of the psychedelic
drugs, and some might object to its being classified with LSD and
similar substances. It is often suggested that marijuana is a
mild intoxicant, more like alcohol.132 There is evidence,
however, that high doses of cannabis in some individuals may
produce effects similar, in some respects, to an attenuated LSD
experience. While such effects are rarely reported, many milder
aspects of the psychedelic experience regularly occur with a
cannabis 'high'. The outline of potential reactions to
psychedelic drugs presented in the section on LSD include: <i>psychotic
and non-psychotic adverse reactions, psychodynamic, cognitive,
aesthetic, and psychedelic-peak (transcendental) or religious
experiences. </i>While analogous experiences may occur in varying
degrees with cannabis, the quality of the effects is reportedly
different, the intensity considerably lower, and the overall
response more controllable than with the more powerful
psychedelic drugs. It would be incorrect to say that cannabis in
moderate dose actually produces a mild LSD experience; the
effects of these two drugs are physiologically, behaviourally and
subjectively quite distinct. Furthermore, since no
cross-tolerance occurs between LSD and THC the mechanism of
action of these two drugs is thought to be different.109 </p>

<p>160. A cannabis 'high' typically involves several phases. The
initial effects are often somewhat stimulating and, in some
individuals, may elicit mild tension or anxiety which usually is
replaced by a pleasant feeling of well-being. The later effects
usually tend to make the user introspective and tranquil. Rapid
mood changes often occur. A period of enormous hilarity may be
followed by a contemplative silence. </p>

<p>Psychological, effects which are typically reported by users
include: happiness, increased conviviality, a feeling of enhanced
interpersonal rapport and communication, heightened sensitivity
to humour, free play of the imagination, unusual cognitive and
ideational associations, a sense of extra-ordinary reality, a
tendency to notice aspects of the environment of which one is
normally unaware, enhanced visual imagery, an altered sense of
time in which minutes may seem like hours, changes in visually
perceived spatial relations, enrichment of sensory experiences
(subjective aspects of sound and taste perception are often
particularly enhanced), increased personal understanding and
religious insight, mild excitement and energy, (or just the
opposite), increased or decreased behavioural activity, increased
or decreased verbal fluency and talkativeness, lessening of
inhibitions, and at higher doses, a tendency to lose or digress
from one's train of thought. Feelings of enhanced spontaneity and
creativity are, often described, although an actual increase in
creativity is difficult to establish scientifically. While most
experts agree that cannabis has little specific aphrodisiac (sex
stimulating) effect, many users report increased enjoyment of sex
and other intimate human contact while under the influence of the
drug.93,161 </p>

<p>Less pleasant, experiences may occur in different individuals,
or possibly in the same individuals at different times. Some of
these reactions may include: fear and anxiety, depression,
irritability, nausea, headache, backache, dizziness, a dulling of
attention, confusion, lethargy, and a sensation of heaviness,
weakness and drowsiness. Disorientation, delusions,
suspiciousness and paranoia, and in some cases, panic, loss of
control, and acute psychotic states have been reported.
Schwarz196 has compiled an extensive catalogue of reports of
adverse symptoms which have been attributed to cannabis in the
world literature. </p>

<p>161. The possibility of psychiatric disorders associated with
cannabis use has received considerable attention. Although there
are some well documented examples of very intense and nightmarish
short-term reactions (usually among inexperienced users in
unpleasant situations and with high doses), these cases seem to
be relatively rare and generally show a rapid recovery. Although
many regular users have had an experience with cannabis which was
in some way unpleasant, 'freak-outs' are apparently rare.
Ungerleider230 has reported 1,887 'adverse reactions' to
marijuana in the Los Angeles area. These data are difficult to
interpret since no clear definition of adverse reaction is
provided and no follow-ups were made. By contrast, Unwin in
Montreal reports:233 </p>

<p>I have seen only three adverse reactions in the past two
years; all following the smoking of large amounts of hashish and
all occurring in individuals with a previous history of
psychiatric treatment for psychiatric or borderline conditions. </p>

<p>The few cases of prolonged psychosis which have been reported
have usually been attributed to an earlier personality
predisposition, although this hypothesis is not always easy to
substantiate. Earlier notions of a specific 'cannabis psychosis'
have generally been abandoned since there is little evidence of
such a distinct psychiatric entity. Smith206 in San Francisco,
reports that he has never observed 'cannabis psychosis' in over
35,000 marijuana users seen at the Haight-Ashbury clinic. But a
recent psychiatric report described several psychotic reactions
occurring in American soldiers in Vietnam, who had used
cannabis.218 The psychiatrist believed that the psychotic
episodes may have been related to cannabis use. This emphasizes
the need for caution before any generalizations about the
evidence of psychiatric complication with cannabis use are made -
particularly in individuals who have consumed large doses of
potent material under conditions of increased physical and
psychological stress. Such general conditions are, of course, by
no means restricted to military operations. </p>

<p>162. There have been a few reports of 'flash-backs' or
spontaneous recurrences of certain cannabis effects some time
after the last use of the drug, although such events are
apparently quite rare. In addition, cannabis has also been
reported to have precipitated LSD recurrences in some heavy users
of LSD.123 </p>

<p>Only a few adequate laboratory investigations have been made
of the effects of cannabis on normal psychological functioning.
Most of the data indicate little change under the conditions
tested, although reports of both impaired and improved
performance have been made. Because of the perceptual, cognitive
and psycho-motor effects often attributed to cannabis, it seems
reasonable to expect that in high doses the drug would impair
automobile driving. Many regular users feel this is so and avoid
driving, while others content that they are more careful and are
probably better drivers when slightly 'high'.93 There is no
available evidence that cannabis has been a significant factor in
traffic accidents. The one study testing cannabis effects on
driving skills found little impairment to be caused by a 'mild
social high'.61 Some of the studies pertinent to these topics
will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section. </p>

<p>163. A study by Suchman217 suggests a close association
between the use of marijuana in some young people and adherence
to what is termed the 'hang-loose' ethic. Central to this notion
is the questioning of such traditional patterns of behaviour and
belief as, conventional religion, marriage, pre-marital chastity
and the accumulation of wealth. Subscribers to this ethic
apparently do not necessarily reject the <i>mores </i>of the
established order, but are strongly critical of them. In this
study, the stronger the student embraced the ethic the more
favourable he was towards marijuana use. Smoking marijuana was
highly associated with 'nonconformist' behaviour such as
participating in mass protests and was more likely to be reported
by those students who were dissatisfied with the education they
were receiving. The 'hang-loose' ethic, while it may represent
antagonism to the conventional world, does not appear to create
apathy and withdrawal. The investigator suggests that the smoking
of marijuana is part of the behaviour associated with this ethic
rather than the cause of it. </p>

<p>A somewhat different view is suggested by McGlothlin and
West154 on the basis of clinical observation. They have described
an 'amotivational syndrome' in some heavy marijuana users in
North America. It is suggested that such use of marijuana may
contribute to some characteristic personality changes including
apathy, loss of effectiveness, diminished capacity or willingness
to carry out complex long-term plans, endure frustration, follow
routines or successfully master new material. The interpretation
of these observations is complicated by the fact that such
individuals are usually involved with other drugs as well as
cannabis. </p>

<p>Several Eastern studies have suggested that chronic high-dose
use of the more potent preparations of cannabis may have
detrimental effects on the individual. One of the most
comprehensive reports was that of the Chopras in 1939.45 An
eight-year study was carried out on a sample of 1,238 cannabis
users. With regard to moderate doses, users of relatively mild
bhang reported a general feeling of well-being, relief from worry
and sharpened appetite. Heavy users were often found to suffer
from several adverse symptoms. In some instances, cannabis use
was seen as an attempt at self-medication in response to theme
disorders rather than as the cause. </p>

<p>The researchers report that among the ganja and charas users,
a small percentage suffered from serious psychiatric disorder,
and minor emotional problems, including impairment of judgement
and memory, were observed in the majority of these subjects.
According to the authors, a significant proportion of the group
had pre-existing neurotic tendencies which may have contributed
to their problem of drug use. Heavy users were often observed to
show marked inactivity, apathy and self-neglect. The majority of
those who took small doses of any of the cannabis preparations
felt that the overall consequences of their drug habit were nil
or beneficial, while the majority of those who chronically took
heavy doses, thought the practice harmful. These subjective
judgements were generally consistent with the clinical
observations reported. </p>

<p>165. This and other reports from Eastern countries are
difficult to interpret and apply to the Western situation. To
begin with, no equivalent data are presented from a comparable
control group of non-users of similar social and economic
background (although some comparisons among users are possible)
and there is no means of estimating the representativeness of the
sample studied. In addition, there are many social and economic
factors which complicate cross-cultural comparisons. The use of
cannabis has a different meaning in Eastern cultures where a long
history and tradition surrounds its use - than it does in the
West, where it is a relatively recent phenomenon. Often, concepts
of normalcy and deviancy differ considerably from one culture to
another. In addition, the Eastern cannabis user generally
consumes larger quantities of more potent forms with greater
frequency than does the Western user. </p>

<p>166. Although the possession of cannabis is a crime, and in
obtaining it an individual must normally come in contact with
other individuals committing drug offences, there is no
scientific evidence that cannabis itself is responsible for the
commission of other forms of criminal behaviour. Chopra and
Chopra45 suggest that cannabis use may, in fact, actually reduce
the occurrence of crime and aggression by decreasing general
activity. While criminals may be more likely to use cannabis than
other individuals, few crimes committed under the influence of
marijuana have been documented, and a casual relationship between
the drug use and other illegal behaviour has not been
established. It may well be that an individual who is inclined to
commit one illegal act (e.g., a drug offence), may also be more
likely than average to transgress in other areas as well. Some
observers feel that the lessening of inhibitions often reported
with cannabis use might, in certain delinquent individuals,
increase the likelihood of asocial behaviour. In a 1967
judgement, rendered by Judge G. Joseph Tauro, Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in the Boston trial of two
men (Leis and Weiss) accused of trafficking cannabis, the
following statement appears:54 </p>

<p>In my opinion, a proper inference may be drawn from the
evidence, that there is a relationship between the use of
marijuana and the incidence of crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>

<p>The brief presented to the Commission by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police dealt at considerable length with the alleged
association of illegal drug use and criminal behaviour in Canada.
This evidence is discussed later in the report. </p>

<p>The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states that:5 </p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the taking of cannabis has not so far
been regarded, even by the severest critics, as a direct cause of
serious crime.... The evidence of a link with violent crime is
far stronger with alcohol than with the smoking of cannabis. </p>

<p>167. <i>Tolerance and Dependence. </i>While gross tolerance to
the major effects of cannabis does not seem to occur in humans,
there are many more subtle aspects of this situation which have
yet to be clarified. Although there is little tendency for
intermittent users to increase dose, certain cannabis effects may
be modified by repeated experiences with the drug. Many
investigators have pointed out that in some individuals there
appears to be a 'reverse' tolerance - i.e., smaller doses may
produce the <i>desired </i>effects after the user has become
familiar with the drug. Many individuals experienced little or no
effect the first time they smoked cannabis. Whether this is due
to initially poor smoking technique, some learning or
psychological adaptation process, or perhaps some more molecular
pharmacological sensitization, is uncertain. On the other hand, a
few individuals appear to be extremely sensitive to the effects
of cannabis at the beginning and may initially report intense,
ornate, and perhaps frightening experiences which are rarely, if
ever, equalled in subsequent administrations. </p>

<p>168. Investigators have reported that regular users learn to
direct or control some of the psychological and behavioural
effects while subjectively 'high' and may be able to perform
certain functions better than non-users given the same dose. This
would suggest that some sort of differential selective adaptation
or tolerance may develop to some of the initially
'uncontrollable' effects.User4 remain sensitive to the rewarding
effects of the drug since there is generally no marked
inclination for them to increase dosage. Some users report that
if they stay 'high' for several days in a row the drug experience
loses much of its freshness and clarity and, consequently, they
prefer intermittent use. </p>

<p>There are reports of chronic, heavy users from the East who
consume what would seem to be rather large quantities by Western
standards.24,30 Whether this reflects some degree of tolerance
with heavy use in these users or differences in desired effects
or general drug-using norms, is not known. </p>

<p>169. Physical dependence to cannabis has not been demonstrated
and it would appear that there are normally no adverse<i> </i>physiological
effects or withdrawal symptoms occurring with abstinence from the
drug, even in regular users. On the other hand, there have been
several reports from the Far East and Middle East, of
irritability, mild discomfort, and certain behavioural symptoms
occurring after withdrawal of the drug in chronic heavy users.24
It must be kept in mind that these cases are not clearly
documented and that the purity of the substances involved is not
certain. Since hashish is smoked with large quantities of tobacco
and other drugs in many Eastern countries, these mixtures could
be responsible for the minor withdrawal symptoms reported. </p>

<p>170. No controlled research has been done into the effects of
discontinued cannabis administration after unusually high doses
of the unadulterated substance have been given over a prolonged
length of time. While such an extreme situation may appear to be
of little social significance, it should be noted that physical
dependence on the sedatives (alcohol, barbiturates and
tranquillizers) usually occurs in only a small minority of users
who take abnormally large quantities of the drug for extended
periods of time. </p>

<p>171. The presence or absence of psychological dependence in a
given situation, of course, depends on one's definition of the
term. While many cannabis users in North America seem to take the
drug once or twice a week, in a social context similar to that in
which alcohol is normally consumed, and readily abstain for weeks
or months with no ill effects, there is a small minority of users
who smoke it daily and whose regular routine and sense of
well-being is disrupted if they are unable to obtain the drug.
Most users apparently find the drug pleasant and desirable, and
often will go out of their way to acquire it - even at the risk
of criminal penalty. However, the craving and urgency associated
with opiate narcotic of sedative (or tobacco) dependence do not
seem to occur. There are reports from the East that considerable
psychological dependence has occurred in a minority of
individuals in whom the use of the drug has become a major
component of their existence.107 </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Cannabis
and other Drugs </h3>

<p>172. The minority of cannabis users studied in North America
have had experience with a variety of other psychoactive drugs,
alcohol and tobacco being the most frequently mentioned. As might
be expected, most of those who smoke cannabis first acquired a
regular tobacco habit. </p>

<p>A link between tobacco smoking and marijuana use has been
suggested by Rowell, who worked closely with the United States
Bureau of Narcotics in the 1930s:191 </p>

<p>Slowly, insidiously, for over three hundred years, Lady
Nicotine was setting the stage for a grand climax. The long years
of tobacco using were but an introduction and training for
marijuana use. Tobacco, which was first smoked in a pipe, then as
a cigar, and at last as a cigarette, demanded more and more of
itself until its supposed pleasures palled, and some of the
tobacco victims looked about for something stronger. Tobacco was
no longer potent enough. </p>

<p>173. The relationship between cannabis and alcohol use has
been the subject of much controversy. Many marijuana users claim
that they have drastically reduced their consumption of alcohol,
or quit it, since using cannabis. They often suggest that
cannabis may be a cure for society's alcohol ills. The
considerable hostility towards and rejection of alcohol expressed
by many cannabis-using youth, however, is clearly not reflected
in the majority of cannabis users. In general, survey studies
find that those who use alcohol are more likely than
'teetotallers' to use cannabis, and most cannabis users still use
alcohol. We have no information as to what effects, cannabis has
on an individual's drinking behaviour and overall alcohol intake.
It is not clear whether cannabis tends to replace alcohol as an
intoxicant in the user population or whether the use of these
drugs is addictive without significant interaction, or if the use
of one of these drugs potentiates the use of the other. It
appears that, if used simultaneously, the alcohol effects
dominate and many of the psychedelic aspects of cannabis are
suppressed. For this reason, many cannabis users refuse to mix
the drugs even if they may enjoy one separately. </p>

<p>The question of comparing benefits and ills of alcohol and
cannabis has become a popular and engaging endeavour. Due to the
profoundly different social connotations and patterns of use, as
well as scientific knowledge of these drugs, such a comparison
must be made on limited and tenuous grounds. </p>

<p>174. In the United States, the majority of persons studied who
had been dependent on opiate narcotics, had previous experience
with cannabis (and were usually heavy users of alcohol). In
Canada this has less often been the pattern, and it appears that
heavy use of sedatives (alcohol and barbiturates) rather than
cannabis has most frequently preceded heroin use.246,215 </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Canadian pattern is becoming
more similar to the United States experience. </p>

<p>On this topic, the <i>United States Task Force Report </i>(1967)
concludes:220 </p>

<p>The charge that marijuana 'leads to the use of addicting
drugs' need to be critically examined. There is evidence that a
majority of the heroin users who come to the attention of public
authorities have, in fact, had some prior experience with
marijuana. But this does not mean that one leads to the other in
the sense that marijuana has an intrinsic quality that creates a
heroin liability. There are too many marijuana users who do not
graduate to heroin, and too many heroin addicts with no known
prior marijuana use, to support such a theory. Moreover there is
no scientific basis for such a theory. </p>

<p>The most reasonable hypothesis here is that some people who
are predisposed to marijuana are also predisposed to heroin use
it may also be the case, that through the use of marijuana a
person forms the personal associations that later expose him to
heroin. </p>

<p>With a similar orientation, the British <i>Cannabis </i>report
(1968) states:5 '. . . we have concluded that a risk of
progression to heroin from cannabis is not a reason for retaining
the control over this drug (cannabis).' </p>

<p>175. Many heavy users of cannabis reportedly also experiment
with a variety of other drugs, including amphetamines as well as
psychedelic substances. Again, marijuana is often the first drug
(other than alcohol and tobacco) taken by youthful multi-drug
users. The role of cannabis in the 'progression' to other drugs
has not been adequately studied and it is unclear whether it
plays a predisposing role, or is often used earlier simply
because of its wider availability and social acceptance. </p>

<p>176. While no cross-tolerance occurs between cannabis and the
other psychedelic drugs or the stimulants, considerable mention
has been made of 'multi-drug' psychological dependence in which
individuals may seem to depend on a variety of drugs in general,
rather than on any particular chemical substance. </p>

<p>177. Initiation of Cannabis Use. Cannabis users are usually
'turned on' for the first time by friends and associates who have
had previous experience with the drug. There is little evidence
of aggressive 'pushers' being responsible for the initiation of
cannabis smoking, although many individuals have reported
considerable peer-group pressure to try it. The distribution or
trafficking of cannabis is largely carried out in the same social
manners and is usually handed from friend to friend, although
there are some individuals whose motivation for trafficking is
primarily commercial. Some of the marijuana in Canada is
'home-grown' but most apparently comes from Mexico and the
southern United States. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Some
Cannabis Studies of Current Significance </h3>

<p>178. I. In 1939, after consulting with the New York Academy of
Medicine, Mayor La Guardia of New York appointed a special
scientific committee to investigate the effects of marijuana,
both in the community and under laboratory conditions. The final
report entitled <i>The Marijuana Problem in the City New York:
Sociological, Medical, Psychological and Pharmacological Studies</i>149
was published in 1944, and is still one of the most widely quoted
and comprehensive studies of cannabis. </p>

<p>The report provoked considerable controversy, and although it
has been generally well received by the scientific community,
certain other individual were quite vociferous in expressing
their dismay at the committee's conclusions. O.J. Kalant120 of
the Addiction Research Foundation, has prepared a careful
critical analysis of the Mayor's report. She observed that:
'Judged from a purely scientific standpoint this study deserves
neither the extravagant praise nor the vicious attacks to which
it has been submitted.' </p>

<p>179. The field work for the sociological study was undertaken
by six specially trained police officers. The squad 'lived' in
the environment in which marijuana smoking or peddling was
suspected. They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dance
halls, subways, public toilets, parks and docks. On the basis of
their observations, the following conclusions were drawn: The
distribution and use was centred in Harlem. While the cost of
marijuana was low and therefore within range of most persons, the
sale and distribution was not under the control of any single
organized group. The consensus among users was that the drug
created a definite feeling of adequacy. The practice of smoking
marijuana did not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the
word, did not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction,
and no effort was made to create a market for opiate narcotics by
stimulating the practice of marijuana smoking. Marijuana was not
the determining factor in the commission of major crimes, nor was
it the cause of juvenile delinquency. Finally, 'the publicity
concerning the catastrophic effects of marijuana smoking in New
York City is unfounded.' </p>

<p>180. The clinical studies were conducted with an experimental
group of 77 persons - 72 of whom were inmates of various New York
Prisons. Forty-eight of these subjects had used marijuana
previously and some had been heavy users of opiate narcotics.
Both orally ingested cannabis concentrate and ordinary marijuana
cigarettes were administered in various quantities. </p>

<p>A feeling of euphoria, occasionally interrupted by unpleasant
sensations, was the usual response to cannabis. Also noted were
other common aspects of a marijuana 'high', such as laughter and
relaxation. No signs of aggression occurred, although some
indications of anti-social feelings were expressed. Dizziness, a
light floating sensation, dryness of the throat, thirst, an
increase in appetite (particularly for sweets), unsteadiness and
a feeling of heaviness of the extremities, were among the common
somatic symptoms noted. Nausea and vomiting occasionally occurred
with oral ingestion. Most effects seemed to increase with dose
and were often more pronounced on those who had not previously
used cannabis. </p>

<p>181. There were 9 cases of psychotic reaction in the prisoners
studied. In 6 instances, acute or short-term adverse reactions
characterized by '... mental confusion and excitement of
delirious nature with periods of laughter and anxiety' occurred.
Three cases of 'true' psychosis appeared to be associated with
the experiment. 'The precise role marijuana in the psychotic
states of the three unstable persons is not clear.' In the first
subject 'the psychotic episode was probably related to epilepsy.'
In the case of the second and third subjects, the fact that they
were sent back to prison to complete their sentences must be
considered an important, if not the main factor in bringing on
the psychosis.' None of the nine individuals had been a regular
user of cannabis. The researchers pointed out, however, that
marijuana can bring on a true psychotic state under certain
circumstances in predisposed individuals. </p>

<p>182. The most consistent physiological effects reported were:
a temporary increase in heart rate, an inconsistent increase in
blood pressure, and increase in frequency of urination, dilated
pupils, and a moderate increase in blood sugar level and basal
metabolism. Other organic and systematic functions were
unchanged. It should be pointed out that the tests reported were
not conducted under controlled double-blind conditions, and some
of these findings have not been confirmed in later controlled
studies. </p>

<p>183. Simple psychomotor functions were only affected slightly
by large doses, and negligibly or not at all by small doses of
marijuana. More complex functions, hand steadiness, static
equilibrium, and complex reaction time were impaired by both dose
levels. Generally, non-users were more affected by the marijuana
than those with previous marijuana experience. Strength of grip,
speed of tapping, auditory acuity, 'musical ability' and
estimation of short time intervals and linear distances were
unchanged. Placebos were not generally used in this section and
the details of the statistical analysis were not presented. </p>

<p>184. In the section on Intellectual Functioning, a variety of
psychological tests designed to measure aspects of intelligence,
learning, memory and performance were administered. Two doses of
oral concentrate were used in most instances. The author
concludes that marijuana ingestion ... has a transitory ,adverse
effect on mental functioning', with the greatest impairment at
high dose on tasks involving complex functions. No statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from random
variation, however, and again, no controlled double-blind design
was used. Furthermore, the author's conclusions are not always
consistent with the evidence which, for example, suggests some
improvement in verbal abilities and certain other functions after
marijuana ingestion. These data are not discussed. The author
notes that 'indulgence in marijuana does not appear to result in
mental deterioration'. </p>

<p>Kalant has noted with respect to this section: 120 </p>

<p>In summary, the results seem to bear out the conclusion that
big enough doses of marijuana impair variety of mental functions,
while small doses may improve some of them. These conclusions are
only tentative, because the author presents no statistical
treatment of the data. </p>

<p>185. The 'Emotional and General Personality Structure' of
varying numbers of users and non-users were studied before and
after several doses of cannabis. The effects of low dose were
generally pleasant and favourably received by the subjects, while
the high dose seemed more likely to produce anxiety, distress,
and a sense of insecurity. The committee concluded: </p>

<p>Under the influence of marijuana the basic personality
structure of the individual does not change, but some of the more
superficial aspects of his behaviour show alteration. The new
feeling of self confidence induced by the drug expresses itself
primarily through oral rather than through physical activity.
There is some indication of a diminution in physical activity.
The disinhibition which results from the use of marijuana
releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
emotions, but does not evoke responses which would be totally
alien to him in his undrugged state. </p>

<p>186. A comparison between users and non-users as regards the
possibility of physical and mental deterioration as a consequence
of marijuana use was made on 48 users, some of whom had been
smoking regularly for two to seventeen years. The investigators
concluded that: </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marijuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. </p>

<p>187. The therapeutic use of cannabis in the treatment of
opiate narcotic addicts was explored in 56 patients. Tentative
conclusions suggest improved appetite and mood, less severe
symptoms and a generally improved clinical picture during
withdrawal. Again no control group was studied. </p>

<p>The Committee reported: </p>

<p>From the study as a whole, it is concluded that marijuana is
not a drug of addiction, comparable to morphine, and that if
tolerance is acquired, this is of a very limited degree.... The
habit depends on the pleasurable effects that the drug produces. </p>

<p>These views were based largely on interviews with hundreds of
users, the sociological studies and the laboratory
investigations. Some observers have pointed out that these
conclusions may not apply to the conditions of heavy chronic use
sometimes reported in Eastern countries. </p>

<p>188. Some individuals have criticized the research for often
using high doses of little social relevance - the authors admit
that users, if left to their own devices, tend to approximate the
lower doses used in the experiment. Other investigators feel that
more chronic users of higher doses should have been studied for
the investigation of long-term effects including tolerance and
dependence. </p>

<p>189. In summary, although the La Guardia report remains one of
the more significant contributions to the cannabis literature,
the conclusions must be qualified in accordance with the numerous
weaknesses in the experimental methodology: blind and placebo
controls were absent and statistical analyses often lacking,
reporting was occasionally biased when the data were ambiguous,
sample selection may not have been adequate for certain
conclusions in the sociological study, and the almost complete
use of prison inmates as subjects in the clinical studies and
hospital ward setting may further restrict generalizations. </p>

<p>190. II. Isbell et al109 investigated the effects of various
doses of smoked and orally ingested tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)in
a group of former opiate narcotic addicts who had also had
experience with marijuana. The drug was compared to an inactive
placebo control in a single-blind design (i.e., the researchers,
but not the subjects, knew which samples were being tested). </p>

<p>191. Regardless of dose and route of administration, THC
caused no significant change in pupillary size, respiration rate,
blood pressure, or knee-jerk reflex threshold. Heart pulse rate
was consistently elevated, and swelling of the conjunctival blood
vessels in the membrane around the eyes occurred after the higher
doses. In both physiological and psychological measures, THC (at
a standard dose) was found to be two to three times as potent
when smoked as when taken orally. </p>

<p>192. Patients identified the drug as being similar to
marijuana and some suggested that it was something like LSD or
cocaine as well. Euphoria was consistently noted and no mention
was made in the report of unpleasant adverse reactions.
Psychological changes included '. . - alterations in sense of
time and in visual and auditory perception (usually described as
keener).' With higher doses, both smoked and orally ingested, '.
. .marked distortion in visual and auditory perception,
depersonalization, derealization and hallucinations, both
auditory and optical, occurred in most patients. THC, therefore
is a psychotomimetic drug and its psychotomimetic effects are
dependent on dose.' Such occurrences may also appear in some
individuals as 'idiosyncratic' reactions at lower doses. It had
been noted that the symptoms which Isbell has labelled
'psychotomimetic' might be called 'psychedelic' by scientists
with a different orientation. </p>

<p>193. The application of these findings to marijuana use as it
occurs in North America is unclear. Some observers, in both lay
and scientific circles, have interpreted this report as an
indication of the dangers of marijuana, while other scientists
question the relevance of these findings in relation to the 'real
world' of marijuana usage.251 </p>

<p>194. III. In 1968, Weil, Zinberg and Nelsen 239,240 reported
the first adequately controlled experiment on cannabis effects in
humans. The primary section of the study is concerned with
effects on nine subjects who were inexperienced with cannabis.
The researchers gave two different doses of marijuana (0.5 and
1.0gm of 0.9% THC) and an inactive placebo substance in a
controlled 'double-blind' situation - i.e., neither the subjects
nor the researchers knew at the time of the experiment which dose
of cannabis or placebo was administered. This procedure greatly
reduces the influence of expectations and bias on the part of
both subjects and researchers. In addition to the naive subjects,
eight chronic marijuana users (who normally smoked daily or every
other day) were tested with the high dose only. No placebo was
used with these subjects since the authors felt that experienced
marijuana smokers could readily distinguish the placebo from the
'real thing', and consequently a true placebo control was not
possible. Subjects took either the drug or placebo by a standard
and uniform inhalation method designed to minimize practice
effects and individual differences in smoking technique.
Subsequently, they were tested on a battery of standard
psychological and psychomotor tasks, and certain physiological
measurements were taken in a neutral laboratory setting. </p>

<p>195. The physiological findings were quite straightforward:
heart rate was increased moderately, no significant change in
respiration rate occurred, blood sugar level was unchanged
(although the timing of the samples may not have been optimal),
no change in pupil size was seen and a slight swelling of the
conjunctival blood vessels (producing a reddening of the
membranes around the eye) occurred. The researchers suggest that
the near absence of significant physiological effects '... makes
it unlikely that marijuana has any seriously detrimental physical
effects in either a short-term or long-term usage.' </p>

<p>196. The capacity for sustained attention (Continuous
Performance Test) was unaffected by cannabis in both the nave
and chronic user groups, even when a flickering strobe light was
presented to provide distraction. Muscular coordination and
attention performance (Pursuit Rotor Test) declined as dose was
increased in nave subjects, but improved slightly after
marijuana use in the chronic users. (This improvement was
considered a result of practice rather than a drug effect but can
not be properly evaluated due to the lack of a placebo
measurement in the experienced users.) Performance on the Digit
Symbol Substitution Test, (a simple test of cognitive function
often used in I.Q. tests) was impaired in the nave groups,
while the experienced smokers started off at a reasonable base
line and actually improved slightly when they were 'high' - a
trend which can not be accounted for solely by practice. A
tendency to overestimate time was also noted in these subjects.
The researchers caution that the differences between users and
nonusers in this study must only be considered a trend since the
testing situations were not strictly comparable for the two
groups. </p>

<p>197. Subjects were given five minutes to talk on 'an
interesting or dramatic experience' and the content of the verbal
report was analysed. Marijuana did not impair the
understandability of the material as measured by the Cloze
method, although judges could consistently distinguish the
transcripts of pre- and post-drug samples in both the naive and
experienced groups. A 'strange' quality in the post-drug samples
was noted but not easily quantified. The investigators suggested
that marijuana may temporarily interfere with short-term memory -
i.e., the ability to retrieve or remember events occurring in the
past few seconds. They feel that this may explain why many
marijuana smokers, when very 'high', may have trouble
remembering, from moment to moment, the logical thread of what is
being said. Controlled investigation of this hypothesis is
currently under way. </p>

<p>198. The experienced subjects were asked to rate themselves on
a scale from one to ten, with ten representing the 'highest' they
had ever been. Ratings given were between seven and ten, with
most subjects at eight or nine. This would suggest that the
sample was of reasonable potency and the smoking technique
effective. On the other hand, with the same dose and smoking
technique, only one of the naive subjects had, a definite
marijuana 'high'. (Interestingly, he was the one subject who had
earlier expressed an eagerness to 'turn on'.) The researchers
point out that the introspective report of an individual is the
only way to determine if he is 'high' on marijuana or not. There
are, as of yet, no known objective signs which allow one to
identify this state. </p>

<p>199. There was no change in mood in the neutral laboratory
setting in either naive or chronic user subjects, as measured by
self-rating scales and a content analysis of the verbal sample.
There were no adverse marijuana reactions of any kind in any of
the subjects, although tobacco cigarettes smoked during a
practice session, using the standard technique produced acute
nicotine reactions in five subjects which 'were far more
spectacular than any effects produced by marijuana'. The authors
conclude: </p>

<p>In a neutral setting persons who are naive to marijuana do not
have strong subjective experiences after smoking low or high
doses of the drug, and the effects they do report are not the
same as those described by regular users of marijuana who take
the drug in the same neutral setting. Marijuana naive persons do
demonstrate impaired performance on simple intellectual and
psychomotor tests after smoking marijuana; the impairment is
dose-related in some cases. Regular users of marijuana do get
high after smoking marijuana in a neutral setting but do not show
the same degree of impairment of performance on the test as do
naive subjects. In some cases, their performance even appears to
improve slightly after smoking marijuana. </p>

<p>200.<i> The New Republic, </i>in an editorial responding to
this report, wrote: 'While pot heads may legitimately ask,
&quot;So what else is new?&quot; the study may have a pacifying
influence on parents and officials who fear the drug on the basis
of unsubstantiated horror stories.'251 While numerous scientists
have expressed similar views, the study does provide a long
overdue empirically adequate beginning to the scientific study of
marijuana effects on humans. While this study has implications
extending beyond the laboratory, there has been a tendency in the
popular press to overgeneralize from the results. It would be
imprudent to extrapolate the findings into social and legal areas
for which the study was not designed and is not appropriate. </p>

<p>201. IV. Jones and Stone116 in 1969 reported that smoked
marijuana (equivalent to Weil's low dose) compared to a placebo
in ten 'heavy users' resulted in: moderately increased heart
rate, altered electroencephalogram (EEG), over-estimation of time
(but no change in time interval production), no effect on the
ability to attend to relevant internal cues to the exclusion of
irrelevant external cues (Rod and Frame test), and no effect on
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (the same measure of cognitive
functioning employed in the Weil study). A double dose of
marijuana (comparable to Weil's high dose) produced a deficit in
visual information processing - the only test studied with this
quantity of drug. </p>

<p>202. The subjects were asked to rate the low dose and placebo
on a scale from 0-100 as to marijuana quality. The mean rating
were 66 for the low dose and 57 for the placebo, which was not a
significant difference. While this suggests that the dose of
marijuana used was probably too low to be very effective and may
reduce the significance of the report, it is interesting that the
supposedly inactive 'placebo' (with only a &quot;trace&quot; of
THC) was given a rating suggesting moderate potency by ten heavy
marijuana users in San Francisco. However, it appears that the
subjective effects of the placebo and low dose marijuana, as
measured by a self-rating subjective symptom check-list, may have
been different, although no statistics are presented, and the
figure containing this information does not clearly identify the
placebo. At any rate, these findings suggest that at low doses a
simple 'highness' dimension may not be easy to quantify reliably.
Unfortunately, Weil did not get ratings on his low dose or
placebo, and Jones did not assess the high dose, so a
reconciliation is not possible with the present data. </p>

<p>203. The researchers also studied a larger dose of marijuana
extract (equivalent to 20 cigarettes) given orally, compared with
a placebo and one dose of alcohol (producing blood alcohol levels
of 0.06 to 0.12%). Several tasks were used with the same
subjects. Certain comparisons among the conditions and drugs are
possible, although the use of a single dose and slight variations
in procedure limits the applicability of the findings. </p>

<p>204. The marijuana smoked in low doses produced an
'unimpressive' high with a maximum effect at about 15 minutes and
lasting about three hours, while the oral administration had a
latency of almost two hours, a peak at three to four hours and
mild subjective effects lasting eight to ten hours. The oral dose
of marijuana occasionally produced nausea and in one case
vomiting, and differed from the smoked material on several
subjective dimensions. The results of the comparisons between the
oral marijuana and the placebo were essentially the same as those
discussed earlier for the smoked material. As a point of<i> </i>reference,
the single alcohol dose did not affect performance on the Rod and
Frame Test, produced an underestimation of time intervals,
decreased rate of information processing, did not affect heart
rate, and produced a slowing of the EEG. Little meaningful
comparison can be made between alcohol and the other treatments
at a single dosage level, however. </p>

<p>205. The report is ambiguous and many important details of
methodology and results are excluded in what appears to be a
preliminary investigation. It should be noted that this study has
only single-blind controls and the investigators knew which drugs
were administered at the time of the experiment. </p>

<p>206. V. A third recent experimental study of marijuana effects
on humans was published by Clark and Nakashima46 in 1968 and is
mentioned here since it is now frequently quoted and, also, to
demonstrate some of the problems of interpreting inadequately
controlled experiments. Several different doses of marijuana
extract (of unknown THC content) were given to 12 marijuana naive
subjects, and the effects recorded on eight psychological tests
in 'one control and two or three subsequent sessions'. </p>

<p>207. The study is unintepretable for a variety of reasons,
some of which follow: since the control session and the various
drug doses were given only once, and on separate days, drug and
dose effects are indistinguishably confounded with various
factors of treatment order (including practice and other learning
effects), and natural variations in performance occurring from
one day to the next; the researchers describe no basis,
statistical or otherwise, for distinguishing the 'effects' from
random variation; they report only trends in the data in one or
two subjects selected on an unspecified basis, and give no
indication of overall group effects; the numerical basis for the
figures presented is unspecified; apparently no placebos were
given on the 'control' day which was invariably the first
session, yet the drug is frequently compared with the 'control'
in individual subjects; apparently no 'blind' controls were
provided in either the experiment or later data analysis; and the
report is presented with a strong negative bias in the
introduction and remainder of the article, which is not supported
empirically. The authors infer marijuana-induced impairment only
on the reaction time and 'digit code memory' tasks, although they
provide no reliable evidence for the presence or absence of
positive or negative marijuana effects on these or the other
tests studied. </p>

<p>Clark concludes that great individual variation exists among
individuals in response to the drug. While this would seem a
reasonable observation, effects have not been identified, much
less the variance of their distribution assessed. The great
variability in the data cannot be attributed solely to the drug
for reasons outlined above. In summary, this study, conducted,
financially supported and published by highly accredited
individuals and institutions, adds nothing but confusion to the
existing knowledge and should encourage scepticism regarding even
modern 'scientific' information on marijuana. </p>

<p>208. VI. Last year Crancer and associates,61 from the
Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles, published the
first experimental study of marijuana effects on automobile
driving skills. A laboratory driving simulator was employed which
had been shown previously to validly predict road accidents and
traffic violations on the basis of speedometer, steering,
braking, accelerator and signal errors measured during a
programmed series of 'emergency' situations. This study has
provoked considerable controversy, some of which may be
dissipated if the different sections of the study are examined
separately. </p>

<p>209. Using a sophisticated methodological and statistical
design, the effects of the single dose of marijuana (2
cigarettes) were assessed in 36 experienced marijuana smokers who
used cannabis at least twice a month. In terms of total THC
administered, the dose was about 22% greater than Weil's high
dose and almost 2  times the standard dose used by Jones.
Crancer reports the effects as a 'normal social marijuana high',
although this is not quantified in any way and it is not certain
how this relates to the overall pattern of marijuana use in the
population. Simulator scores were obtained at three intervals
over a 4  hour period. Control (no treatment) sessions were
run, although no placebo substance was used since the
investigators felt that a placebo would not be effective with
experienced marijuana users. </p>

<p>210. Overall performance under the single dose of marijuana
was not different from the control. The main study was followed
by two 'cursory' investigations. Four subjects were retested with
three times the original drug dose and none showed a significant
change in performance. Furthermore, four marijuana naive subjects
were tested after smoking enough marijuana to become 'high' (all
consumed at least the amount used in the main experiment and
demonstrated an increase in heart rate in addition to subjective
effects). No significant change in scores occurred with the drug
in these subjects either. </p>

<p>The investigators caution that the study does not necessarily
indicate that marijuana will not impair driving. </p>

<p>However, we feel that, because the simulator task is a less
complex but related task, deterioration in simulator performance
implies deterioration in actual driving performance. We are less
willing to assume that non-deterioration in simulator performance
implies non-deterioration in actual driving. </p>

<p>211. One weakness of this part of the study is that apparently
no standard and uniform smoking technique was employed and it is
not certain how much of the active principle was actually
absorbed. Although a biochemical method for detecting THC in the
body has recently been developed, quantitative measurements have
not been employed in any experimental marijuana studies. Although
higher doses were tested in some subjects, this was not done with
the same thoroughness as the main experiment and little can be
asserted regarding a dose-response effect of marijuana on
driving. It seems likely that if the dose were pushed high enough
some impairment would occur, although this has not been
empirically demonstrated. </p>

<p>212. In order to obtain some standard reference point for this
study, the subjects were also tested under a single dose of
alcohol, designed to produce a blood alcohol level corresponding
to the legal standard of presumed driving impairment in
Washington (i.e., 0.10% blood alcohol level). The average number
of errors under alcohol (97.4) was significantly greater than
that acquired under either the normal or marijuana condition
(each averaging 84.5 errors). While it is clear that a meaningful
comparison of the two drugs cannot be based on a single dose of
each, the alcohol data were obtained merely to provide a
'recognized standard' of impairment. </p>

<p>Kalant118 has pointed out that the blood alcohol level of
these subjects may have been considerably higher than the desired
0.10%, and that comparisons between the drugs must be made with
caution due to the single doses used. He also suggests that
although it would not have been easy for the subjects to 'fake'
good driving performance under marijuana, an anti-alcohol bias,
as often seen in marijuana users, could have resulted in poorer
performance in the alcohol condition. </p>

<p>If the limitations of the alcohol-marijuana comparison and the
weakness of the marijuana dose-effect generalizations are
realized, the over-all study provides interesting tentative
information on the effects of a moderate quantity of marijuana on
driving skills. </p>

<p>213. VII. In general, studies of the long-term history of
marijuana users have been based either on medical or criminal
samples or on subjects selected because of current use. Each of
these sources of subjects has considerable intrinsic sampling
bias - which greatly complicates the interpretation of results.
Recently, however, Robins and associates,187 reported the first
study of the long-term outcome of marijuana use in a group not
selected for deviant behaviour. The subjects were 235 Negro men
who had gone to public elementary school in the black district of
St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 1940s. While the
characteristics of such a population may have questionable
applicability to present marijuana use in Canada, this generally
thorough study should be carefully considered. The data are
largely based on recent retrospective personal interviews and
official records. Subjects were classified according to
adolescent drug use. </p>

<p>214. Persons in this sample who had used marijuana (and no
other drug except alcohol) differed significantly from
non-marijuana users, in that the users had more often: drunk
heavily enough to create social or medical problems, failed to
graduate from high school, reported their own infidelity or
fathering of illegitimate children, received financial aid, had
adult police records for non-drug offences, and reported violent
behaviour. While these findings indicate an association between
marijuana use and these other behavioural characteristics in this
population, causal variables have not been identified. </p>

<p>215. The heavy use of alcohol in these subjects complicates
the interpretation considerably. Every marijuana user also used
alcohol, and drinking usually preceded marijuana use. Among the
subjects who used only marijuana and alcohol, 47% had medical or
social problems attributable to drinking ('the
&quot;shakes&quot;, liver trouble, family complaints, arrests,
etc.') after the age of 25, and 38% of the users met the criteria
for alcoholism. When those subjects who were classified as
alcoholics were eliminated from the data (and the remainder of
the problem drinkers left in) the only statistically significant
difference between the marijuana users and the non-users was with
respect to financial aid received in the past five years.
Non-significant trends remained, however, which were generally
similar to the earlier differences. Subjects who used 'harder'
drugs (e.g., heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates) in addition
to marijuana were significantly more deviant than the non-users,
even after the alcoholics had been eliminated from the sample.
Almost one-half of the subjects who had used marijuana also had
used other drugs illegally. </p>

<p>The alcoholics, in addition to having a history of early
drinking, were also more likely to have used marijuana as
adolescents. Unfortunately, no record of intensity of early
drinking or marijuana use was obtained. A possible causal
relationship between marijuana use and problem drinking, or
vice-versa, or a possible third set of factors predisposing
certain individuals to both alcoholism and marijuana use cannot
be established or denied on the basis of the present data. The
relationship between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs is
also troublesome. </p>

<p>The authors conclude: </p>

<p>One small study of the effects of drug use in 76 Negro
adolescents can hardly serve to determine the laws of the land.
But it may at least make us cautious in too readily supporting
the view that marijuana is harmless, until some better evidence
is available. </p>

<p>216. VIII. The Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario has
recently conducted a study of 232 confirmed marijuana users in
Toronto.173 Prisons and court referrals provided about half of
the subjects and the remainder were volunteers not contacted
through criminal-legal channels. The majority came from
middle-class or upper middle-class homes and 16% were students.
The average age was 22 (range: 15-42) and males outnumbered
females 4 to 1. The average duration of marijuana use was 2.7
years (range: 1-20). </p>

<p>217. Preliminary observations suggest the following
characteristics in this sample: the subjects tended to be
multiple drug users (tobacco and alcohol were used by almost all
of the subjects, more than half had tried LSD and speed, and
one-third had tried opiate narcotics); most had 'trafficked' in
marijuana, but usually just to friends; cannabis was generally
used about twice a week in the company of friends, accompanied by
passive rather than active behaviour; purported reasons for use
were increased perception and awareness, other psychedelic
effects, improved mood, and conviviality. Almost all subjects
found the usual effects favourable although about a third had had
at least one unpleasant experience (physiological or
psychological) with the drug; about half had driven a car while
under the influence of cannabis, and of these subjects, more than
half felt that their driving ability was unimpaired by the drug;
about half felt that cannabis had improved their lives, while
some thought it had worsened things; the subjects 'tended to be
underactive physically, engaging in passive pursuits'; about
one-third subscribed to the belief in the 'protestant work
ethic', while almost as many rejected it; almost one-third had
committed non-drug criminal offences; one-half showed a swelling
of the fine conjunctival blood vessels around the eye;
nonspecific deviant EEGs were frequently seen; more than half
were thought by a psychiatrist to be psychologically unstable or
disturbed; and the group as a whole tended to be more imaginative
and creative than what would be expected in the general
population. </p>

<p>218. The researchers stress that their findings demonstrate an
association, and not necessarily a causal relationship, between
the regular use of cannabis and other characteristics in this
sample. While some of these results may be attributable to the
selection or bias of the sample (e.g., half were contacted
through criminal correction channels), much of the information
may have general application. On-going analysis of the data
should further clarify the results, although the lack of a
comparable matched control group will undoubtedly preclude
certain generalizations since we have little information
regarding the incidence of many of the aforementioned
characteristics in non-marijuana using individuals of similar
social, economic and educational backgrounds. Furthermore, the
frequent use of other drugs by these subjects may limit
conclusions specific to cannabis use. </p>

<p>219. IX. In response to questions raised in the British House
of Commons, the Government of India, in 1893, appointed a
commission to investigate and report on the cannabis ('hemp
drugs') situation in India. The commission was instructed to
inquire into the extent to which the hemp plant was cultivated,
the preparation of drugs from it, the trade in those drugs, the
extent of their use, and the effects of their consumption upon
the social, physical, mental, and moral conditions of the people.
The different forms of the drug, especially bhang, ganja, and
charas (hashish), were to be studied separately. The Commission
'&#133;should ascertain whether, and in what form, the
consumption of the drugs is either harmless or even beneficial as
has occasionally been maintained'. In addition, they were asked
to investigate certain economic aspects of the use of hemp (e.g.,
tax arrangements and import and export patterns), and also the
potential political, social or religious results of prohibition. <i>The
Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission </i>(1894),107
including appendices, comprised seven volumes and totalled 3,281
pages. </p>

<p>220. In 1968, Mikuriya,158 in the first thorough discussion of
this report to appear in the Western scientific literature,
suggested that this investigation </p>

<p>. . . is by far the most complete, and systematic study of
marijuana undertaken to date.... It is both surprising and
gratifying to note the timeless and lucid quality of the writings
of these British colonial bureaucrats. It would be fortunate if
studies undertaken by contemporary commissions, task force
committees, and study groups could measure up to the standard of
thoroughness and general objectivity embodied in this report ...
many of the issues concerning marijuana being argued in the
United States today were dealt with in the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission Report. </p>

<p>Until recently only about a half dozen copies of this report
were available in North America. In the introduction to a new
printing of the primary volume in 1969, Kaplan121 observed: </p>

<p>That this report, which remains today by far the most complete
collection of information on marijuana in existence, should have
been so completely forgotten in an era when controversy over the
effects of the drug and, the wisdom of its criminalization has
increased to such fervor is almost inexplicable. </p>

<p>221. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission received testimony from
1,193 witnesses of a total of 80 meeting in 30 cities. Over 300
medical practitioners were consulted and inquiries were made of
Commanding Officers of all regiments of the Army, The
commissioners investigated the records of every mental hospital
in British India and evaluated separately each of the 222 cases
admitted during the year 1892, in which some connection between
hemp drugs and insanity had been suggested (these made up about
10 per cent of all admissions) Furthermore, all 81 cases of
crimes of violence in India purported to have been caused by
cannabis over the previous 20 years were investigated and
re-examined. In addition, three laboratory experiments were
conducted with monkeys to study the effects of cannabis on the
nervous system. </p>

<p>222. In the short time during which the full report has been
available to us, we have not been able to prepare, at this
interim stage, a thorough critical analysis of the document.
However, the following quotations, taken from the summary of
conclusions regarding the effects of hemp drugs, provide an
overview of the findings: </p>

<p>It has been clearly established that the occasional use of
hemp in moderate doses may be beneficial. In regard to the
physical effects, the Commission have come to the conclusion that
the moderate use of hemp drugs, is practically attended by no
evil results at all. There may be exceptional cases in which,
owing to idiosyncrasies of constitution, the drugs in even
moderate use of hemp drugs in even moderate use may be injurious,
excessive use does cause injury. As in the case of other
intoxicants, excessive use tends to weaken the constitution and
to render the consumer more susceptible to disease &#133; the
excessive use of these drugs does not cause asthma. . . it may
indirectly cause dysentery ... (and) it may cause bronchitis. </p>

<p>In respect to the alleged mental effects of the drugs, the
Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of
hemp drugs produces no injurious effects on the mind.... It is
otherwise with the excessive use. Excessive use indicates and
intensifies mental instability... It appears that the excessive
use of hemp drugs may, especially in cases where there is any
weakness or hereditary predisposition, induce insanity. It has
been shown that the effect of hemp drugs in this respect has
hitherto been greatly exaggerated, but that they do sometimes
produce insanity seems beyond question. </p>

<p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the Commission
are of opinion that their moderate use produces no moral injury
whatever. There is no adequate ground for believing that it
injuriously affects the character of the consumer. Excessive
consumption, on the other hand, both indicates and intensifies
moral weakness or depravity. . . . In respect to his relations
with society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him to
degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest practices; and
occasionally, but apparently very rarely indeed, excessive
indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to violent crime. But for all
practical purposes it may be laid down that there is little or no
connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime. </p>

<p>Viewing the subject generally, it may be added that the
moderate use of these drugs is the rule, and that the excessive
use is comparatively exceptional. The moderate use practically
produces no ill effects. In all but the most exceptional cases,
the injury from habitual moderate use is not appreciable. The
excessive use may certainly be accepted as very injurious, though
it must be admitted that in many excessive consumers the injury
is not clearly marked. The injury done by the excessive use is,
however, confined almost exclusively to the consumer himself; the
effect on society is rarely appreciable. It has been the most
striking feature in this inquiry to find how little the effects
of hemp drugs have obtruded themselves on observation. </p>

<p>As noted earlier in this chapter, any generalizations from one
culture to another must be made with great caution. In this
instance, extrapolation to the present Canadian situation would
have to span three-quarters of a century as well. In spite of
these clear limitations, the thoroughness of this critical
inquiry commands respect and the report deserves careful
consideration. <br>

<h3>OPIATE NARCOTICS </h3>

<p> </p>

<p>223. The term narcotic has had wide and inconsistent usage in
lay, legal and scientific circles. Some use the word to
characterize any drug which produces stupor, insensibility or
sleep; many apply it only to derivatives of the opium plant
('opiates'); others consider the term equivalent to
addiction-producing; and in legal matters, 'narcotics' may refer
to almost any allegedly dangerous drugs (for example marijuana
and cocaine are often considered with opiate compounds in
narcotics regulations in spite of the fact that they have little
in common with them). To reduce some of this ambiguity, the
specific phrase opiate narcotic will be used in this report, and
will be restricted to drugs which are derivatives of, or are
pharmacologically similar to products of the opium plant <i>papaver
somniferum</i>. </p>

<p>224. The earliest unambiguous description of opium to which we
have access was written in the third century B.C., although some
scholars have cited references to opiate-like drugs dated more
than 5,000 years ago.29 Many believe that Homer's 'Nepenthe' was
opium. These drugs are obtained from the juice of the unripened
seed pod of the opium poppy plant soon after the flower petals
begin to fall - no other part of the plant produces psychoactive
substances. </p>

<p>Although 'opium eating' has been known in Asia for thousands
of years, widespread use of the drug did not occur until the
development of the British East India Company's wholesale opium
empire in the eighteenth century. The practice of smoking opium
developed in China soon after American tobacco was introduced to
the Orient. Chinese prohibition of the British opium precipitated
the 'opium war' in which the world's greatest naval power forced
China to open its door to the British (opium) trade. 223 </p>

<p>225. In 1805, the major active constituent in opium was
isolated - an alkaloid given the name morphine, after the Greek
God of Dreams, Morpheus. In the next half century, various other
alkaloids were discovered, such as codeine and papaverine, both
if which are in general use today. Since then, a variety of
semisynthetic (e.g., heroin, in 1874) and synthetic (e.g.,
methadone, Demerol* and Alvodine*), opiate-like drugs have been
developed. These compounds have the potential of producing
qualitatively similar actions (at different doses), although
there is considerable variability among them in the potency of
the different opiate effects. Heroin, more potent on a weight
basis than morphine, is usually the choice of the chronic opiate
narcotic user. This drug was originally considered
'non-addictive' when put on the market. Those members of the
medical and related profession who use these drugs non-medically,
as well as others who have become dependent as a result of
medical use, tend, to use morphine or the synthetics. Because of
the similarities among these drugs, they will, with a few
exceptions be dealt with as a group. Heroin (and sometimes other
opiate narcotics) is often referred to as 'H', 'horse', 'junk',
'scrag' or 'smack'. </p>

<p>226. Until the nineteenth century, 'raw' opium was either
smoked or taken orally. There is a decidedly lower dependence
liability -with these techniques than: with 'practices' which
followed and it was not until the isolation of morphine and the
invention of the hypodermic needle that the opiate narcotics
became a serious problem in the Western World. Morphine was
widely acclaimed among medical practitioners and was used freely,
to treat pain during the American Civil War, sometimes producing
a dependency called 'soldiers' disease'. General use of tincture
of opium in many patent medicines (e.g. Paregoric) made the quasi
-medical use of opiates a common practice in North America at
that time. On the West Coast, the influx of Chinese labourers,
some of whom smoked opium, apparently stimulated non-medical use
to some degree. The extent of opiate narcotic problems in the
nineteenth century is difficult to ascertain, however, it would
appear that the use of these drugs was not a major moral issue.
In the early part of the twentieth century, some of the problems
of morphine and heroin dependence became apparent, and most
opiate products were removed from the open market in North
America and non-medical possession was prohibited. </p>

<p>227. Because characteristics fluctuate with social change, a
description of drug users is necessarily tied to a given
population at a given point and time and may have little general
application. There is little information on opiate narcotic users
in North America prior to this century, but many researchers
contend that far more women than men made use of these drugs at
that time. Since the general opiate prohibition in the early part
of this century, men have become the predominant users. While
Chinese opium smokers were not uncommon a half century ago, there
appear to be very few Orientals in North America using opiate
narcotics today. In recent decades, the use of these drugs in
Canada has tended to centre on a few urban areas. Medical and
related professions represent a frequently noted high-risk group
with respect to the development of drug dependency. For various
reasons, statistics on the incidence of dependency in this group
are quite inadequate. Many researchers contend that health
profession dependents constitute a significant proportion of the
total chronic opiate narcotic using population.28 For many years,
the known opiate narcotic users have made up about 0.02 per cent
of the overall Canadian population. </p>

<p>228. Although many observers do not feel that the non-medical
use of opiate narcotics is currently a major public health
problem in Canada, there are numerous reasons for directing
attention to this group of drugs. Historically, the popular
conception of the 'narcotics addict dope fiend' has established
an image of the non-medical drug user which persists and intrudes
into almost every examination or investigation of drug use today.
Furthermore, the opiate narcotics have played an important role
as a model in much of the past and present drug legislation, and
in general crimino-legal approach to the control of socially
censured drug use. Although many important questions about the
opiate narcotics are still unanswered, it is clear that much of
what has commonly passed for fact, is fiction, and often bears
little resemblance to scientific information. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>229. Most of the current medical uses for the opiate narcotics
were fairly well understood and established in Europe by the
middle of the sixteenth century, and were probably well known in
certain areas long before that time. These drugs are primarily
used in the relief of suffering from pain, in the treatment of
diarrhoea and dysentery, and to reduce cough. Hundreds of related
compounds have been synthesized in attempts to retain the
clinical benefits but reduce the dependence liabilities of the
opiate narcotics. These efforts have not been very successful,
and thus morphine and related drugs are still considered by
physicians to be among the most valuable drugs available to the
practitioner today. Heroin is no longer used medically in North
America. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>230. Opiate narcotics are produced in a variety of tablets and
capsules, elixirs, cough syrups (with codeine), injections,
rectal suppositories and, on the illegal market, are also
available in a gummy solid or powdered form. Codeine is often
mixed with other non-opiate analgesics (e.g. APC &amp; C*;
222's*). While the opiate narcotics are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract, this route is often erratic and
unpredictable compared to injections. Among non-medical users,
subcutaneous ('skin popping') and intravenous ('mainlining')
injections are commonly used with heroin and morphine. Raw opium
is usually eaten or smoked and the powder is sometimes sniffed
('snorted'). Only a minute fraction of the drug absorbed actually
enters the central nervous system. The duration and intensity of
the effects vary considerably with the different drugs in this
class (and as a function of dose), although the major action
might typically last from three to six hours. These drugs are
usually inactivated in the liver and excreted in the urine, often
along with small quantities of free morphine. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom"><img
src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Physiological
Effects </h3>

<p>231. Pure opiate narcotics produce few significant
non-psychological effects in therapeutic doses. The immediate or
short-term physiological response usually includes a general
reduction in respiratory and cardiovascular activity, a
depression of the cough reflex, a constriction of the pupil of
the eye, and minor reduction in visual acuity, slight itching,
dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, warming of the skin, a
decrease in intestinal activity (often causing constipation),
and, in some individuals, nausea and vomiting. In higher doses,
however, insensibility and unconsciousness result. The primary
toxic overdose symptoms are coma, shock and, ultimately,
respiratory arrest and death. </p>

<p>232. There appears to be little direct permanent physiological
damage from chronic use of pure opiate narcotics. Numerous
complications are observed, however, if the overall drug use
pattern involves adulterated street samples, unsterile
administrations, unhygienic living standards, poor eating habits
and inadequate general medical care - all of which are commonly
part of the criminal-addict behaviour syndrome. Commonly reported
disorders in street users are hepatitis, tetanus, heart and lung
abnormalities, scarred veins ('track marks'), local skin
infections and abscesses, and obstetrical problems in pregnant
females. At one time, malaria was also commonly seen in this
population. </p>

<p>233. The general mortality rate among heroin dependents is
considerably higher than normally expected for their age group.
Sudden collapse and death following intravenous injection has
been reported in a number of these individuals. Such fatalities
have often been attributed to overdose resulting from erratic and
unexpected variations in the purity of drugs obtained from the
black market. However, there is considerable evidence that many
of these deaths are not merely due to overdose but are a
consequence of partly soluble contaminant substances in the
sample and, perhaps, some drug hypersensitivity phenomenon.43 </p>

<p>234. The subjective effects of narcotics may vary considerably
among different individuals and situations. Most persons
reportedly do not enjoy the experience and may actively avoid its
repetition in a controlled or experimental situation, while
others describe feelings of warmth, well-being, peacefulness and
contentment. Euphoria or dysphoria, nausea, drowsiness,
dizziness, inability to concentrate, apathy and lethargy are
commonly noted. Certain individuals, especially when fatigued may
be stimulated into feelings of energy and strength. Higher doses
produce a turning inward and sleep. Often a pleasant dreamlike
state occurs. Some regular users describe their drug experiences
in near ecstatic, and, often sexual terms (especially the 'rush'
of intravenous injection). </p>

<p>The potential of the opiate narcotics to relieve suffering
from pain depends upon several mechanisms. The major effect is
not on the sensation directly, but on the psychological reaction
to it. Often individuals can still feel the pain sensation, and
rate its intensity reliably, in spite of the fact that much or
all of the negative or unpleasant aspects are absent. In other
words, they may still feel the pain, but it does not bother them
to the same extent. Morphine has little effect on the other
senses and unlike non-narcotic analgesics and sedatives, it can
often control pain at doses which do not necessarily produce
marked sedation, gross intoxication or major impairment of motor
coordination, intellectual functions, emotional control or
judgement.110 In addition to reducing the anxiety of pain and
therefore the motivation to avoid it, the opiate narcotics also
tend to decrease other primary motivation associated with sex,
food, and aggression. </p>

<p>235. The psychological effects of chronic opiate narcotic use
are often rather straightforward extensions of the short-term
response. In regular users, much of the variability and
unpredictability of the immediate response is lessened, partly
because individuals who find the experience unpleasant tend to
avoid additional exposure, and also because many who were
initially upset by the unusual physiological and psychological
sensations caused by the drugs learn to tolerate and even seek
them and may no longer be distressed in the situation. While some
individuals who become dependent on the opiate narcotics withdraw
from regular social activities, and live what might appear to be
an immoral, criminal and slovenly existence, others are able to
lead an otherwise normal life with little change in work habits
or responsibilities. Possible factors underlying these
differences will be discussed later. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Tolerance
and Dependence </h3>

<p>236. Tolerance to the different actions of opiate narcotics
varies with the magnitude and frequency of administration, and
the response being measured. In chronic use, a considerable
degree of tolerance occurs to the sedative, analgesic, euphoric
and respiratory depressant (and, therefore; potentially lethal)
effects; less tolerance develops to the constipating and
pupil-constricting activity. Consequently, persons who are
motivated by the chronic avoidance of pain or other unpleasant
subjective conditions, or perhaps simply by the positive euphoric
effects of the drug, are likely to increase dose and may
eventually tolerate several times the quantity which would be
lethal to a normal individual. Occasional use does not produce
tolerance, however. </p>

<p>237. The degree of physical dependence acquired to these drugs
is closely related to the tolerance developed. With low dose or
infrequent use, little dependency occurs and withdrawal symptoms
may be nonexistent, or merely resemble the symptoms of a mild
flu. Withdrawal of the drug after chronic high-dose use results
in a severe and painful pattern of responses which are similar to
those associated with alcohol and barbiturate dependence
(although it is not as physically dangerous). Usually less than
half a day after the last administration, the dependent begins to
feel irritable, anxious and weak; he sweats and, shivers and his
eyes and nose become watery. A few hours of uneasy sleep may
intervene before he begins the 'cold turkey' phase. The skin
becomes clammy, the pupils dilate, chills, nausea, vomiting, and
severe abdominal cramps occur with uncontrollable defecation;
tremors and, rarely, convulsions may develop. While death has
been reported, fatalities are much rarer than with sedative
withdrawal. The major symptoms of the abstinence syndrome
generally last several days, and gross recovery usually occurs
within about a week, although complete recuperation may take up
to six months .145 Tolerance is eliminated or greatly reduced
with withdrawal. Babies born of dependent mothers are also
physically dependent on the drug, and may die if withdrawal
symptoms are not recognized and treated soon after birth. It
should be noted that the different opiate narcotic drugs have
varying dependence-producing potentials, and physical dependence
is rarely seen in opium smokers or users of codeine (although
strong psychological dependence may occur). </p>

<p>238. Considerable cross-tolerance and cross-dependence exists
among the opiate narcotics. An intravenous injection of any of
these drugs, in sufficient dose, can completely eliminate the
withdrawal syndrome in a matter of minutes. Methadone can prevent
withdrawal symptoms at doses which provide little psychological
effect, and is frequently used in chronic 'maintenance'
programmes designed to rehabilitate dependents. Although the
sedatives and opiate narcotics do not usually show significant
cross-tolerance and dependence, barbiturates can ease the pain of
opiate withdrawal. Nalorphine (Nalline*) antagonizes the effects
of the other opiate narcotics and precipitates the withdrawal
syndrome in dependent individuals. This drug has been used to
'test' for dependence in suspected users. </p>

<p>219. ' The role of physical dependence in the overall picture
of chronic opiate narcotic use has been the subject of much
controversy and many observers feel that the psychological
components are the most important. Some investigators argue that
the fear of withdrawal is often the primary motivating factor
behind continued use, while others emphasize the profound craving
seen in some individuals, or the drug's positive reinforcing or
reward potential. Many dependent persons return to the drug at
some time after withdrawal, and some have occasionally been known
to voluntarily undergo withdrawal in order to lose tolerance (for
economic reasons), and immediately initiate chronic use again, at
a less expensive level. This practice suggests that, with some
individuals, psychological factors other than mere avoidance of
the abstinence syndrome can be dominant in the drug dependence.
Whether this motivation is related to the desire to escape or
avoid a life that is unpleasant, or emotionally painful or
depressing, or perhaps a more directly hedonistic demand for
pleasure or 'kicks', or even a disguised attempt at
self-destruction is not clear - no simple answer could be
expected to have much generality or validity. It has frequently
been observed that some individuals become dependent on the
hypodermic syringe (or 'point') in a way which is, in some
respects, independent of the pharmacological properties of the
drug. Persons showing such conditioning are often called 'needle
freaks'. </p>

<p>240. It is interesting to note that there are only a few
middle-aged persons who are dependent on opiate narcotics. Most
individuals spontaneously lose interest in the drugs before they
turn 45 years of age (barbiturate and alcohol dependents show no
such decline in use). Whether this is due to psychological or
physiological factors is uncertain. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Opiate
Narcotics and Crime </h3>

<p>241. A consensus exists among medical, law enforcement and
research authorities, as well as drug users themselves, that few
crimes of violence are directly produced by the use of the opiate
narcotics. On the other hand, there is a considerable
relationship between crime and opiate narcotic dependence in
North America and many drug dependent persons have non-drug
criminal records. This apparent paradox can be explained by two
important factors. To begin with, both in Canada and in the
United States, many individuals who become dependent on opiate
narcotics have a prior history of behavioural problems and
delinquency and have continued these practices. The second factor
is economical, and is associated with the high cost of heroin on
the black market and the demands made by extended tolerance. </p>

<p>Because of the illegal nature of the drug, the cost of a heavy
heroin habit may run anywhere from $15.00 to $50.00 a day and
higher, in spite of the fact that the medical-cost of the drugs
involved would just be a few cents. There are very few legitimate
ways in which most individuals can afford to meet that kind of an
expense. Consequently, when tolerance pushes the cost of drug use
above what the user can afford legitimately, he is forced into a
decision - either quit the drug and go through withdrawal, or
turn to easier, criminal, methods of acquiring the necessary
money. While many users refuse to become involved in such
activities and stop using the drug, at least temporarily, many
turn to petty crime, small robberies, shoplifting and
prostitution. These are the individuals who regularly come to the
attention of the law enforcement officials. More affluent persons
may be able to support the habit and continue indefinitely
without running afoul of the law. Medical profession dependents,
for example, apparently have less tendency to commit non-drug
offences - perhaps (in addition to predisposing psychological and
sociological factors) because they can often steal with little
risk or purchase the necessary drugs at low cost. </p>

<p>As Jaffe has stated:111 </p>

<p>The popular notions that the morphine addict is necessarily a
cunning, cringing, malicious and degenerate criminal who is
shabbily dressed, physically ill and devoid of the social
amenities, could not be farther from the truth. The addict who is
able to obtain an adequate supply of drugs through legitimate
channels and has adequate funds, usually dresses properly,
maintains his nutrition and is able to discharge his social and
occupational obligations with reasonable efficiency. He usually
remains in good health, suffers little inconvenience and is, in
general, difficult to distinguish from other persons. Good health
and productive work are thus not incompatible with addiction to
opiates. However. ... such continued productivity is the
exception rather than the rule. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">The
Development of Dependence </h3>

<p>242. There have been a number of popular misconceptions about
the pattern of development of opiate narcotic dependence. Rumours
have frequently been heard that marijuana and hashish had been
spiked with heroin to produce opiate addiction in the
unsuspecting user. Similar rumours have been heard about 'spiked'
LSD. In fact, there are no known documented cases in Canada of
opiate narcotic adulteration of other drugs alleged to be pure.
The high price of illicit heroin renders such a hypothesis
extremely improbable. Furthermore, it would be highly unlikely,
if not impossible, for tolerance and dependence to develop
without the user knowing it. The majority of users, both here and
in the United States, were apparently first 'turned-on' by their
friends and peers. Blum (in the United States Task Force Report)
points out:28 </p>

<p>There is no evidence from any study, of initiation as a
consequence of aggressive peddling to innocents who are 'hooked'
against their will or knowledge. . . The popular image of the
fiendish pedlar seducing the innocent child is wholly false. </p>

<p>243. The once popular notion that the opiate narcotic
experience is intrinsically so pleasurable, or that physiological
dependence develops so rapidly, that most who are subjected to it
are promptly addicted is without support. In one experiment,
injections of morphine were given to 150 healthy male volunteers.
Only three were willing to allow repeated administration and none
indicated that he would have actively sought more. The
investigators42 conclude: </p>

<p>. . .opiates are not inherently attractive, euphoric or
stimulant. The danger of addiction to opiates resides in the
person and not the drug. </p>

<p>Lasagna et al 126 also report that the majority of normal
pain-free individuals found effects of opiates quite unpleasant.
Beecher22 reports that only ten per cent of a normal population
liked the morphine experience. Furthermore, many individuals who
developed tolerance and physical dependence in a medical
situation show little interest in the drug experience itself and
tend not to resume use after withdrawal. Even in non-medical
cases, there is evidence that only a small proportion of drug
users who have experimented with opiate narcotics in the streets
become physically dependent on them.42 </p>

<p>244. Many observers contend that certain, social and
personality factors predispose some individuals to drug
dependence and that otherwise normal individuals rarely, if ever,
become chronically dependent. There is considerable evidence that
both the ready availability of the drug and a social milieu
tolerating or encouraging drug use (either medical or
non-medical) are also important factors. Although there are
numerous individuals who have gradually worked up from occasional
'skin popping' to chronic 'mainline' dependence, there is at
present, little evidence that a large proportion of the Canadian
population is running this particular risk. However, there is
cause for apprehension because of the rapidly growing incidence
of heroin use among the young in the United States. Although
there are no known methods of predicting the likelihood of
dependence for any individual at this time, the use of opiate
narcotics involves a risk of considerable proportions for anyone.
</p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Opiate
Narcotics and Other Drugs </h3>

<p>245. In the United States, the opiate narcotic offender coming
to the attention of the law enforcement officials was often
reported to have previously and concurrently been a heavy user of
alcohol, barbiturates, tobacco, and marijuana. In Canada, the
pattern appears to be much more variable and heterogeneous.
Alcohol and barbiturates (and probably tobacco) have apparently
been the drugs most often associated with opiate narcotic use
here246, 215, although recent indications suggest that many new
heroin users may have experience with marijuana and other
psychedelic drugs as well. 170a There are reports that LSD is
generally not popular with regular heroin users, however.41 Some
opiate narcotic users also make use of stimulants such as
amphetamine and cocaine. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Much attention has been and is now being given to the
        'stepping-stone' or 'progression' theory of opiate
        narcotic dependence. Although there is no pharmacological
        basis for the hypothesis that one drug creates a 'need'
        for, or necessarily leads to another, there are numerous
        social factors which might link together the use of
        various drugs. It may well be that the questions of
        'progression' or predisposing experiences can never be
        definitively answered. Like other characteristics
        associated with deviant behaviour, they must be
        continually evaluated anew as the social context changes.
        Some observations on the possible relationship between
        marijuana and opiate narcotic use were presented in the
        previous section on cannabis. </li>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR </h2>

<h2>SOME CAUSES OF NON-MEDICAL DRUG USE</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>316. The recommendations of the Minister of National Health
and Welfare which gave rise to the appointment of the Commission,
and the Commission's terms of reference, place particular stress
on the desire to understand the causes of the non-medical use of
drugs. We regard our inquiry into these aspects of the phenomenon
to be one of our most important functions. The terms of reference
speak of motivation, and they speak of the social, economic,
educational and philosophical factors that have led to such use. </p>

<p>317. By cause we understand not merely the immediate, direct
motivation for a particular drug experience, but the larger
social significance of the phenomenon - how it relates to various
aspects of life today - family relations, education, work,
institutions, and conditions of life generally. In what way is it
a response to the problems of modern living? What are its
philosophical or spiritual implications? What does it say about
our value structure? How does it reflect the way people think
about the future? </p>

<p>At this time it is clearly impossible to provide a full and
comprehensive statement of cause in these terms. At best we can
hope to convey some of the interpretive themes and to describe
some of the characteristics that have struck us as significant
that seem to have the merit of illuminating from one perspective
or another this complex phenomenon. We seek to do this for a
variety of reasons: to report in general some of our reactions
and impressions; to assist in a preliminary way to add to the
common understanding of a phenomenon that has aroused great
interest, but that has also caused concern and anxiety, and has
brought anguish to many parents; to suggest to citizens,
especially parents and guardians; avenues of approach that may be
helpful to them in understanding with sympathy and perhaps
empathy a social fact that is to them strange and bewildering. </p>

<p>But we must emphasize the to tentative nature of these
comments. They are not to be taken as a conceptual framework for
an understanding of the changes or responses about which we are
concerned. They do not constitute such a framework for the
Commission. They are impressions. We intend to test them as
rigorously as possible by intensive investigation. We invite
critical comment from all quarters. In this way the interim
report may serve a useful dialectical function, assisting us in
consultation with our fellow citizens, to arrive at a full and
sound understanding of this phenomenon. </p>

<p>318. The first problem we face is how to get at the facts of
motivation and other related factors. What are we to accept as
evidence of these facts? These are very subjective matters. Can
we ever be sure that we know the truth? Whether we can or not, it
seems to us that we must rely primarily on what drug users
themselves say about their personal motivation and other factors
predisposing them to use drugs. These statements must be weighed
for credibility and carefully considered for proper
interpretation but they are the primary and best source of an
understanding of motivation. This was the approach followed by
William James in his <i>Varieties of Religious Experience,</i> a
phenomenon which has certain affinities with the subject-matter
of our inquiry. The best evidence of the experience, the
subjective effects of which may be presumed to be the primary
motivation of cause, comes from the words of those who have
undergone it. This is not to say that insight cannot be gained
from the observations and interpretations of psychologists,
social philosophers, sociologists and other informed and
qualified students of our society. Thus we shall have recourse,
in trying to explain this phenomenon, to both the words of drug
users and the interpretations of observers. Finally, we shall
offer our own interpretation, although this can only be a
tentative one at this time - one that is offered as a basis for
further consideration and discussion by the people of Canada. </p>

<p>319. Our inquiry has taken several forms: the public hearing
of the traditional kind in which briefs have been submitted but
in which there has been a full opportunity for questioning and
discussion by everyone present; private hearings with groups and
individuals; numerous discussions with drug users and various
experts having not only theoretical insight into the problem but
active points of contact with it through some professional
involvement; presentation of evidence regarding law enforcement
and correction; and we have heard from experts in the areas of
education; medical services; family life and social welfare.
Although we intend to inquire further into motivation (as well as
extent of use, perception of the problem, and general attitudes)
in the surveys to be carried out this year, we do not necessarily
rely on the answers to survey questionnaires as the most reliable
evidence of motivation. Motivation is too subtle, complex, and
full of nuance to be adequately elicited through questionnaires.
We place as much or more reliance on the impressions derived from
hearing individual drug users speak at length in public and
private meetings about their experience and what they think to be
the causes. In many ways we are closer here to the art of the
novelist than that of the social scientist. We can only offer
hypotheses - the validity and acceptance of which will depend on
their ability to make sense of this phenomenon - to provide a
meaning which is satisfactory to Canadians. It is like the
ultimate test of any philosophy or religion. But it is important
to emphasize once again that what is recorded here is merely our
first impression gleaned from initial contacts during the first
six months or so of our inquiry. </p>

<p>320. The explanations of motivation and the other related
factors vary considerably. They vary between the different
drug-using populations and they vary within a particular
population. It is idle to seek a single, unifying explanation or
theory. This whole area is characterized by bewildering diversity
and conflicting impressions, but certain dominant themes do seem
to emerge. </p>

<p>321. The motivational patterns underlying drug use also vary
to some extent from drug to drug. In the case of cannabis, a
major factor appears to be the simple pleasure of the experience.
Time after time witnesses have said to us in effect: 'We do it
for fun. Do not try to find a complicated explanation for it. We
do it for pleasure.' This is the explanation frequently offered
for the use of cannabis, particularly by college students and
adults in the working world. A mother of four and a teacher said:
'When I smoke grass I do it in the same social way that I take a
glass of wine at dinner or have a drink at a party. I do not feel
that it is one of the great and beautiful experiences of my life,
I simply feel that it is pleasant and I think it ought to be
legalized.' </p>

<p>A person involved in work with drug users expressed it this
way: 'I think maybe it is time we stopped all the sociological
nonsense about social milieux, and how your daddy fell off a
horse, and how your mommy burnt the pablum or whatever it is - or
what kind of sociological trip you want to blast off on, and just
say in front what you mean which is &quot;I get loaded because I
love to do it&quot;.' </p>

<p>322. Many of us think of human behaviour in general as a
consequence of needs that are either inherited or learned. There
is some tendency to think of behaviour such as drug use as a
consequence of pathological need patterns. However, we feel it
would be a serious error, at least as far as cannabis use is
concerned, to think of use as symbolic of or manifesting a
pathological, psychological or even sociological state. Simple
pleasure, similar to that claimed for the moderate use of
alcohol, or food, or sex, is frequently offered as the general
explanation for most current drug use. This is particularly true
of the growing number of adult users (who share perhaps little
else but their taste for cannabis with the members of the 'hip'
culture). It is no doubt true that for some the use of drugs is a
reflection of personal and social problem. But the desire for
certain kinds of psychological gratification or release is not
peculiar to the drug user or to our generations. It is an old and
universal theme of human history. Man has always sought
gratifications of the kind afforded by the psychotropic drugs. </p>

<p>323. They will vary with the particular drug used and, to some
extent, with the personality of the user. In the case of <i>cannabis,
</i>the positive points which are claimed for it include the
following: it is a relaxant, it is disinhibiting; it increases
self-confidence and the feeling of creativity (whether justified
by objective results or not); it increases sensual awareness and
appreciation; it facilities concentration and gives one a greater
sense of control over time; it facilitates this way makes it
easier to accept others; it serves a sacramental function in
promoting a sense of spiritual community among users; it is a
shared pleasure; because it is illicit and the object of strong
disapproval from those who are, by and large, opposed<i> </i>to
social change, it is a symbol of protest and a means of
strengthening the sense of identity among those who are strongly
critical of certain aspects of our society and value structure
today. </p>

<p>324. Those who have used cannabis are not unanimous in its
praise, although clearly the vast majority am to regard it as
either a harmless pastime or the source of real advantages and
gain. Those who have used the drug and then criticize it tend
most often to say it can dominate a weak personality; it can take
too much time; it can become an excuse for procrastination; it
lessens the ability to persevere with unpleasant, boring or
routine tasks. </p>

<p>325. Often a cannabis user has said, 'We can't explain it to
you. Why don't you try it?' It has been implied that there is
something ineffable about the experience, although this is more
often the case when speaking of the effects of LSD. Sometimes one
wonders if what is being conveyed is not a certain sense of
exclusiveness, a smugness of the initiated. But we prefer to
believe that it is the subtle and multifaceted aspect of its
psychological and social significance for the average user that
makes words seem inadequate to convey the whole of its meaning.
Indeed, many users have insisted that the makers of cannabis are
able to communicate without the use of words; that they recognize
and understand one another and share important assumptions and
attitudes. Whether this silent communication is more than the
knowledge of a common experience is not clear. But users speak of
a sense of affinity, a larger consciousness, of which they are
made to feel a party by the drug experience. </p>

<p>326. Thus there is unquestionably a strong suggestion of
community, of cultural solidarity, among cannabis users. And
there is a definite tendency to proselytize, to encourage others
to take up the practice. It may be partly due to the illicit
status of the practice which makes users want to increase the
numbers involved and thus the concern of society about its
present policy. But there is also a definite impression that the
cannabis user seeks to convert others to what he sincerely
believes to be a superior outlook and life style. The smoking of
cannabis becomes a rite of initiation to a new society and value
system. These are aspects of cannabis use, particularly among the
younger, more idealistic members of our society, which merit
serious consideration in any attempt to measure its potential for
growth. </p>

<p>327. We gather from the statements of cannabis users that the
drug is predominantly used in groups to enhance, enrich and ease
social intercourse. However, the statements of LSD users imply
that their experience is much more. LSD is spoken of as a very
profound experience, not to be lightly entered into. With some it
is never to be repeated; with others, its profound character, the
sense of venture into the unknown, the very real risks of adverse
effect, make it a practice which seems likely to remain fairly
restricted. It is cheaper than psychoanalysis but appears to
carry with it some of the same implications- the promise of
greater, self-knowledge and self-acceptance but at the same time
uncertainty as to the personality that will emerge. Except for a
relatively few devotees, LSD is not a regular experience having
social or communal significance. It is rather a venture into
self-discovery which sometimes takes on turning point
significance for the subject. The self-revelation experienced may
or may not become a basis for attitudinal change. It is thus a
foundational experience rather than a casual one, as is the case
of cannabis. </p>

<p>328. It is with reference to LSD that the most serious claims
for spiritual significance are made, Timothy Leary has spoken in
terms of a new quest for religious truth and experience. 'It's
the same old pursuit. The aims of our religion are those of every
religion of the past: we work to find the God within, the
divinity which lies within each person's body.'1 Users frequently
speak of the LSD experience in mystical terms. There is repeated
testimony to a feeling of oneness with others - of a loss of the
sense of personal identity in a sense of being a part of
everything that is around one. There is a pantheistic sense of
affinity and identification. </p>

<p>329. While pleasure, curiosity, the desire to experiment, and
even the sense of adventure, are dominant motivations in drug
use, there is no doubt that a search for self-knowledge and
self-integration and for spiritual meanings are strong
motivations with many. We have been profoundly impressed by the
natural and unaffected manner in which drug users have responded
to the question of religious significance. They are not
embarrassed by the mention of God. Indeed, as Paul Goodman has
observed, their reactions are in interesting contrast to those of
the 'God is dead' theologian. It may be an exaggeration to say
that we are witnessing the manifestations of a genuine religious
revival, but there does appear to be a definite revival of
interest in the religious or spiritual attitude towards life. As
one drug user put it: 'The whole culture is saying, &quot;Where
is God?&quot; I don't believe in your institutions, but now I
know it's there someplace.' Another witness said, 'I just find
that a lot of people are becoming a lot more aware of what's
happening and joining in on a universal cause, a cosmic sort of
joyousness and people are getting interested in spiritual things
as well, because this is what our generation and the previous
generations have lacked&#133;.' </p>

<p>330. Drug use is by no means indispensable to the new outlook.
Some people are fortunate enough to be what users call a natural
'turn on'. It is conceded that you can be 'turned on' without
drugs - vital, human, and aware of all your senses, enjoying
authentic, non-exploitative human relations, and alive to beauty
and the possibilities of the moment. Indeed, there is an active
doctrine of transcendence which sees drug use as a catalytic or
transitional thing to be abandoned as soon as it has enabled you
to glimpse another way of looking at things and of relating to
life and people. The doctrine of transcendence carries much hope
for the future. One witness said.- 'I don't do too many drugs
anymore because I have gone beyond them. They have taught me the
lesson and there isn't so much need for them any more. I mean
it's still fun to get stoned but there's a lot more to it. There
is more to it than just fun. After you have learned the lesson,
you have fun in virtually anything.' </p>

<p>331. Many users have stated that the insights gained through
drug use have carried over and remained with them, continuing to
shape their attitudes and outlook and style of relating when they
were not using drugs. In other words the drug has been a means of
discovering a new way to be more relaxed and self-accepting, more
accepting and indeed loving, more appreciative of the intensity
and value of being human in the moment, less anxious about time
and specific goals. In listening to these statements one can not
help feeling that this discovery was often made in other ways in
the past - through traditional religious experience, for
instance. </p>

<p>Modern drug use would definitely seem to be related in some
measure to the collapse of religious values - the ability to find
a religious meaning of fife. The positive values that young
people claim to find in the drug experience bear a striking
similarity to traditional religious values, including the concern
with the soul, or inner self. The spirit of renunciation, the
emphasis on openness and the closely knit community, are part of
it, but there is definitely the sense of identification with
something larger, something to which one belongs as part of the
human race. </p>

<p>332. Young drug users are highly critical of many aspects of
our modern life. In this they are perhaps not much different,
than the critical minority that one finds in each generation. But
one has its own unique history and has lived through a formative
period unlike any other. What are the distinguishing features of
that background? In what way is it truly different from the one
which shaped the outlook of previous generations of young people?
The distinguishing marks would seem to be: a generalized
middle-class affluence, a very rapid rate of technological
change; the oppressive, almost foreboding character of certain
problems or menaces which cast a serious doubt about man's
ability to survive - nuclear power, overpopulation, environmental
pollution, racial hostility and the widening gap between wealth
and poverty. All these and other aspects of the human predicament
today impart a distinctive character to the outlook and response
of our youth. An example of the criticism of the economic system
is the following statement by a university student: </p>

<p>I think it is essential that there should be some manner by
which we could break down the economic system. We still need
productivity. But you can get away from the economic basis, from
the competitive basis on which people, once they have gone into
something, have to beat you down. You have this aspect of wanting
to share which we should develop. You should be willing to share
together. But you can still have productivity without
competition. </p>

<p>333. To this point we have been concerned largely with the
statements and interpretations of drug users themselves. We turn
now to interpretation - our own and that of other commentators.
Present-day affluence plays a curious role. Without it there
could not be the freedom for speculation and experiment - the
luxury of cultivating the inner self. At the same time it repels.
It is both taken for granted and repudiated. There is a love-hate
relationship. The drug-taking minority of this generation cannot
be inspired by the goals of their fathers. They do not feel the
same urgency to achieve material success and do not seek
self-fulfilment that way. It may be that they see no way of
achieving their own sense of personal identity in attempting to
repeat, probably with less success, what their fathers have
already done. There is reason to believe that young people from
less comfortable circumstances are more strongly motivated
towards traditional career patterns and material success. But
there would seem to be more than merely trying to find a role
different from that of one's father. The materially more
sophisticated young people, those more familiar with material
well-being and less anxious about their ability to maintain it,
think they see a future in which it will be impossible to avoid.
They envisage a society which will be obliged to assure a
sufficient amount of material security to everyone in order to
maintain itself politically and economically. They therefore
conclude that it is a goal for which it is now unnecessary to
plan or to which it is futile to devote a significant amount of
ones time and energy. </p>

<p>334. There is also a strong impression that young people are,
as it were, unconsciously adapting time when there will be much
less work to go around. The rapid rate of technological change
and the pervading threat of work obsolescence makes them very
uncertain about their own occupational future. They seem to
suspect that a high proportion of them may have to learn to live
happily with relatively little work. Those of us who are
well-established in work tend to talk glibly of a future in which
there will be increasing leisure. Little thought or practical
effort has been devoted to the problem of how to fill that
leisure in constructive and satisfying ways. The exploration of
the inner self, the expansion of consciousness, the development
of spiritual potential, may well be purposes to which young
people are turning in anticipation of a life in which they will
have to find sustaining interest in the absence of external
demands and challenges. </p>

<p>335. Young people speak often of a desire to overcome the
division of life into work and play, to achieve a way of life
that is less divided, less seemingly schizophrenic, and more
unified, They seem to be talking about the increasingly rare
privilege of work that one can fully enjoy - of work that is like
one's play. They claim to he prepared to make considerable
renunciations or sacrifice of traditional satisfactions like
status and material success for work in which they can take
pleasure. Indeed, one of their frequent commentaries on the older
generation is that it does not seem to enjoy its work, that it
does not seem to be happy. This is said sadly, even
sympathetically. It is not said contemptuously. The young say, in
effect, 'Why should we repeat this pattern?' The use of drugs for
many is part of a largely hedonistic life style in which
happiness and pleasure are taken as self-evidently valid goals of
human life. </p>

<p>336. Role rejection is an important theme of the cultural
reaction that is associated with much of contemporary drug use.
One young person suggested that letting one's hair grow was in
part at least a rejection of the manhood role. Young people do
not deny the historic validity or necessity of these roles for
the older generation nor the positive achievements which must be
credited to them; they simply say that they are no longer
relevant or desirable. The role which many reject is that of the
achievement-oriented male, committed, body and soul to the big
corporation, and feeling increasingly the need to give proofs of
his masculinity. Some have spoken of drugs as dehabituating,
desophisticating, and deconceptualizing - as helping the
personality to break out of old moulds. They speak of a release
or recovery of child-like innocence - the essential perspective
of the artist. </p>

<p>337. There can be no doubt that there is a search for
authenticity in thought, in stance, in personal relations. The
drug becomes a means of dissolving the mask, of escaping from
pretence, affectation and stereotyped reaction and attitude,
although their place may be taken by other stereotypes - a
cultist enthusiasm which expresses itself in knowing smiles and a
private language. What happens under LSD is far from clear, but
users speak of blowing holes in the conscious mind through which
bits of the subconscious emerge, to be always accessible in the
future. It is the language of self-discovery - the eternal search
for the main-springs of one's personality - the attempt to find
liberation from psychological burdens, from 'hang ups', as they
are popularly called. </p>

<p>These human desires, these goals, are not new: they may be
summed up as the attempt to become a 'real person'. This has been
a goal of religious or spiritual concern down through the
centuries; the attempt to pull together the dispersed or
fragmented pieces of the self. It is often expressed as the
search for an identity. </p>

<p>338. There is in man a powerful and long-term tendency to
attempt to weave the experience and perceptions of the individual
into a logically consistent whole, centred when possible on a
single cosmological principle or theme. In such a whole, man
seeks for a meaning to life in the broad sense, for goals towards
which to direct himself and the means by which he can reasonably
hope to attain these goals. Through such a structure man hopes to
find the nature of his own relationship to existence in general
and to his fellows. When such a synthesis of experience is
available, not only to an individual but in a form that can be
shared and accepted by some large numbers of people, it can
become the ideological basis for social life and, as such, serve
as a unifying principle for a society. Such syntheses of
experiences were achieved by minds such as those of Saint Thomas
Aquinas, John Calvin and Karl Marx. In the absence of such
syntheses, man and society suffer. The responses that are made by
man in periods of ideological vacuum often appear strikingly
similar. For instance, there seem to be striking parallels
between the orientation of the stoics and cynics at the time of
the collapse of the Greek world, and the response of the 'Beat
Generation' and the 'Hippies'. In both instances the individual
seems to withdraw from his society and to seek reality within
himself. </p>

<p>339. Are there special elements in the present human situation
that impose particular stresses and burdens that would account
for the increasing dependence of old and young on drugs? In this
context we repeatedly encounter the term 'alienation'. The use of
this term has been discussed by Kenneth Keniston in these words:2
</p>

<p>Although formal discussions of alienation itself are largely
limited to the last 150 years, the theme of alienation - of
estrangement, outcastness and loss - is an archetypal theme in
human life and history.... The ambiguous concept of alienation
has in recent years become increasingly fashionable and, partly
as result, increasingly devoid of any specific meaning. More and
more the term is used to characterize whatever the author
considers the dominant maladies of the twentieth century; and
since views differ as to what these maladies are, the meaning of
alienation fluctuates with each writer. . . . Writers like Fromm,
Kahler and Pappenheim use 'alienation' to describe a variety of
conditions ranging from separation of man from nature to the loss
of pre-capitalist work relationships, from man's defensive use of
language to his estrangement from his own creative potential, and
from the worker's loss of control over the productive process to
the individual's feeling of social or political powerlessness. Of
course, the purpose of such writers is to suggest that all of
these different phenomena are connected, that all result from
some characteristic of modern society. </p>

<p>In the testimony we have heard, the term 'alienation' is most
often used to refer to the estrangement of many young people and
adults from the institutions, processes and dominant economic,
social and political values of our society; to this inability to
think of a good and meaningful life being available to them in
the society; to their sense of inability to affect or influence
the course that society will follow or the great issues of peace
and war, poverty, pollution and others. </p>

<p>340. Many of our modern youth are undoubtedly suffering from
too great self-expectation. This is partly the result of
exaggerated paternal expectation - parents confusing their own
affluence (which may be as often the product of an aggressive
acquisitiveness as innate intelligence) with the inherited
characteristics which they are capable of passing on. It is also
partly the result of a sense of wider opportunity reflected in
universal education. More is possible; more is expected. There
develops a disquieting gap between expectation and ability. Dr
Vivian Rakoff said: 'We use drugs to find out how far we can go,
rather than as a device for passivity. Drugs can be a spurious
way to fill the gap between aspiration and capacity.' </p>

<p>341. Witnesses appearing before the Commission have sometimes
referred to the word <i>'anomie' </i>to express one of the
possible 'causes' of the non-medical use of drugs. Whether these
speakers referred to the literal 'Anomie' or to some other state
of confusion or estrangement closer to 'alienation' is not easy
to determine. But, in fact, and in any case, the Commission was
told that a certain anomie in which the Canadian society lives
does call for a response, a reaction: self-search, integration,
new values, evasion, etc. Literally, anomie means 'normlessness'.
This state, well described by the French sociologist, Emile
Durkheim (especially in relation to suicide), does not often
result from the total absence of norms but emerges from the
co-existence of conflicting norms, rendering the aiming towards
precise goals very difficult; contradicting values are expressing
themselves through co-existing norms. </p>

<p>The Commission thinks that the concept of anomie and the
existence of anomie situations may be part of the explanation
that it will be trying to discern, in the course of its mandate.
However, anomie and alienation are used all encompassingly as two
of the 'causes' of nearly all social problems,<b> </b>these
concepts will have to be treated carefully, and critically. The
term 'anomie' is neither specific nor very useful operationally
(it cannot account for a specific problem. e.g., How is it that
all people living under anomic conditions do not resort to
drugs?) </p>

<p>342. Contemporary drug use is also associated with a loss of
faith in reason and a new emphasis on emotion. As one young high
school student put it, 'Young people today want to learn feelings
more than facts.' Paul Goodman has described the loss of faith
thus:3 </p>

<p>There is a lapse of faith in science. Science has not produced
the general happiness that people expected, and now it has come
under the sway of greed and power; whatever its beneficent past,
people fear that its further progress will do more harm than
good. And rationality itself is discredited. Probably it is more
significant than we like to think that intelligent young people
dabble in astrology, witchcraft, psychedelic dreams, and whatever
else is despised by science; in some sense they are not kidding.
They need to control their fate, but they hate scientific
explanations. </p>

<p>Keniston has spoken of a 'cult of experience' and declares:4 </p>

<p>Central to this cult is a focus on the present - on today, on
the here-and-now. Thus, rather than to defer gratification and
enjoyment for a distant future, immediate pleasure and
satisfaction are emphasized. Rather than reverence for the
traditions of the past, experience in the present is stressed.
Psychologically, then, such human qualities as control, planning,
waiting, saving, and postponing on the one hand, and revering,
recalling, remembering and respecting on the other, are equally
de-emphasized. In contrast, activity, adventure, responsiveness,
genuineness, spontaneity and sentience are the new experimental
values. Since neither the future nor the past can be assumed to
hold life's meaning, the meaning of life must be sought within
present experience, within the self, within its activity and
responsiveness in the here-and-now. </p>

<p>343. This emphasis on feeling, and immediate experience
reflects itself in an interest in the arts and in nature. Many
young people speak of a heightened appreciation of the beauties
of nature. This is related to the aesthetic repugnance they feel
towards many of the physical aspects of modern urban life. One<b>
</b>student said that he did not feel any desire for drugs for
two weeks when he was on a canoe trip in the Canadian north. The
drugs may often be an attempt to escape from a pervading urban
ugliness into a world of interior beauty. </p>

<p>344. We suspect that much contemporary drug use simply serves
the purpose of relieving the stress and tension which most
people, young and old, experience in modern living. Certainly
this is a dominant function of alcohol and nicotine which are
still the most prevalent drugs in all age groups, (see Chapter
Three). It is also true of the large quantities of barbiturates
consumed by adults. In the vast majority of cases it is idle to
look beyond the relief of tension for an explanation. This is the
pleasure or gratification most generally sought by the drug
user.5 </p>

<p>Chemical comforts are extremely varied in their chemical
nature, but what they do have in common is their ability to
produce pleasure. In this it can be noted that people only become
dependent on substances which they report produce pleasure and
the dependency potential of any substance, drug or food, may be
predicted by seeing how much pleasure it gives to the patient.
The pleasure they produce is reduction of tension, in addition to
any other social or physical effects they might have. </p>

<p>345. Some commentators have identified a degree of strain that
is peculiar to the impact of communications in our age. Keniston
has referred to it as 'stimulus flooding and psychological
numbing'. Dr Paul Christie, the superintendent of the Queen
Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto has spoken of 'chronic
confusion'. As Keniston puts it: 6 </p>

<p>One of the conditions of life in any modern technological
society is continual sensory, intellectual, and emotional
stimulation which produces or requires a<b> </b>high tendency
towards psychological numbing&#133; the quantity, intensity and
variety of inputs to which the average American is subjected in
an average day probably has no precedent in any other historical
society.... The problem arises, however, because the shells we
erect to protect ourselves from the clamours of the inner and
outer world often prove harder and less permeable than we had
originally wanted.... Thus, in at least a minority of Americans,
the normal capacity to defend oneself against undue stimulation
and inner excitation is exaggerated and automatized, so that it
not only protects but walls off the individual from inner and
outer experience ... the feeling and fear of psychological
numbing leads to a pursuit, even a cult, of experiences for its
own sake. </p>

<p>346. Many observers tend to characterize the psychological
predisposition to the use of <i>methamphetamines </i>('speed') as
one of deep depression. Wilfrid Clement, who has had extensive
clinical experience with 'speed freaks', has expressed the
opinion that 'we are faced with major generalized social
depression as a reaction to our technological society'. Both Mr
Herb Tookey and Mr Barry Luger, who have had a great deal of
contact with the 'speed' community through their work with <i>The
Trailer </i>in Toronto (see Chapter Six), have emphasized this
depression. Tookey says, 'The methedrine user is usually
chronically depressed with a passive-dependent personality.'7 The
depression seems to come from the feeling of powerlessness and
inability to cope with various environmental problems and the
demands of modern life. Luger puts it this way: 'Most potential
speed freaks are depressed because of their past environmental
and institutional problems and see no positive experiences in the
foreseeable future. They were not able to cope with the problems
at home, at school or with their middle-class group.'8 The
depression, Tookey says, is 'often manifested behaviourally by a
lack of goal orientated behaviour. The methedrine user has
considerable difficulty in constructing and carrying out long
range plans (i.e. getting and maintaining a job, going to school,
etc.)' The feeling of being able to cope is very important.
'Coupled with chronic depression', says Tookey, 'is episodic
angry agitation which appears to result from, feelings of
impotency, rejection, inferiority, and lack of control over the
environment.'9 </p>

<p>The 'speed freak' can be seen as a casualty of the increasing
complexity of the demands for adaptation and survival in a
technological society. Says Tookey, 'The &quot;speed freak&quot;
usually hits poor interpersonal skills and invariably is unable
to make the discriminations necessary to deal with a complex
technological society.'10 Clement sees the problem as one of
adaptation in a time of rapid change and contrasts the 'speed
freak' with what he calls the 'super-adaptive' youth. Clement
expresses the view that the 'speed freak's' depression relates to
his perception of his peers and their relative ability to cope
with the demands on them - not only the demands of the
educational system but also the demands of social adaptation.
They experience anxiety about their function and identity in the
future. They can see peers able to tolerate the speed and
bewildering demands of modern life. The sight of the
'super-adaptive' peer fills the average young person with a sense
of inadequacy. The contrast in abilities is shown most clearly in
after-school activity - in response to the demands of
sociability. </p>

<p>The desire for a supportive, reinforcing community is a strong
motivation for the use of speed. 'For the vast majority', says
Tookey, 'the speed community provides a very strong, though
anonymous identity. Paradoxically, identity is found by losing
personal identity to the group. &quot;I'm a speed freak&quot;.'11
The speed freak community has few moral standards but it shows a
rough loyalty to its members. John Bradford, President of
Rochdale College, said, 'One reason why kids use speed is that
they are trying to imitate a life style they're not part of and
don't understand.' He was referring to the life style of the
'heads' - the users of psychedelics. </p>

<p>347. Many young people profess to have little belief in the
future - to find it difficult to visualize a future for
themselves. In one small group we met with during our hearings
one of the women said, 'Very few in our generation believe we are
going to live to be forty.' There was general agreement in the
group, with this statement. Paul Goodman in his article, <i>'The
New Reformation', </i>has emphasized this point: 'Again and again
students have told me that they take it for granted they will not
survive the next ten years. '12 </p>

<p>348. There is also a suggestion that this emphasis on
experience in the present reflects a reaction against the
constraints on the personality produced by the habit-forming,
role-imposing, conformity of modern society. It is a reaction
against role and rule - an attempt to find spontaneity, variety,
and unstructured expression in personality and experience. This
reflects again the importance of the dehabituating effect of the
drugs - their capacity to break down moulds into which behaviour
and personality are threatened with confinement by the various
pressures towards conformity. Benjamin DeMott has written very
perceptively of this reaction in an article entitled <i>'The
Sixties: A Cultural Revolution'. </i>He emphasizes that it is
common to all age groups. DeMott sums up this new longing and
reaching out which cuts across all age groups as: 13 </p>

<p>The will to possess one's experience rather than be possessed
by it, the longing to live one's own life rather than be lived by
it, the drive for a more various selfhood than men have known
before. ... Young, old, black, white, rich and poor are pursuing
the dream of a more vital experience ... at the root of our
yearning stand the twin convictions: that we can be more, as men,
than we're permitted to be by the rule of role and profession,
and that the life of dailiness and habit, the life that lives us,
precedes us, directs us to the point of suppressing moral
conscience and imagination, is in truth no life at all. </p>

<p>One witness reflected something of the same emphasis in his
explanation of the effects of drugs: </p>

<p>Marijuana makes a person child-like. LSD and mescaline are a
ticket to childhood. They are desophisticators, they break down
the conceptual structure through which the person interprets or
views the world. Categories which were always perfectly
acceptable are now of questionable value, things which were never
noticed or were always taken for granted now jump out to the
person presenting unsolvable metaphysical problems. Every event
has deep meaning, every thought is profound. </p>

<p>349. This phenomenon can also be viewed from the perspectives
of psychiatry and abnormal psychology. There are many in the
public who tend to view the non-medical use of drugs as
symptomatic of a pathological psychological state. There is no
doubt but that some of those who use drugs such as cannabis or
LSD are mentally ill; this is also true of some proportion of
those who use alcohol and the mental illness is causative to some
degree of their use. However, it is the view of the Commission
that the majority of drug users do not take drugs as a result of
pathological motivation. Nevertheless it is desirable to draw
attention to some of the psychological and psychiatric problems
that are suggested to be contributing factors underlying
non-medical drug use. </p>

<p>350. From the psychological point of view, overstimulation and
exposure to an overwhelming stressful and complex environment,
which requires the individual to perform too many and too
difficult differentiations and to solve problems which surpass
his coping ability, are likely to lead to a disturbance ('a
jamming') of his capacity to deal effectively with the excessive
in-put to his central nervous system. In animals, such situations
produce pathological states of maladaptive behaviour which are
often referred to as 'experimental neuroses'. In man, it is
likely that similar mechanisms prevail, and pathological states
of neurosis or personality disorder, even psychosis, may develop
under these conditions. </p>

<p>Looking once more at the experimental animal model, it is
interesting that animals whose behaviour has become severely
disturbed through environmentally-produced stress can be
temporarily 'normalized' by the administration of tranquillizing
drugs. Animals under these conditions prefer, in fact, water with
added alcohol or tranquillizing drugs to plain water. </p>

<p>This suggests that severely disturbed humans, too, may often
resort to drugs which produce relaxation of 'instant rest'<b> </b>as
a temporary escape from intolerable tensions in a world which
offers less and less natural opportunities to do so. It is
noteworthy and apparently paradoxical, that amphetamines - the
stimulating 'speed' drugs - are among the most effective medical
means of alleviating states of pathological nervous over-activity
in children, and that these drugs can often help such children to
regain increased self-confidence and greater powers of
concentration. Claims for similar effects of 'speed' are often
made by the teenager who is plagued by the awareness of his own
inadequacy. This may be interpreted as the choice of a different
'chemical defence' against the threat of an overwhelming
environment - instead of 'instant rest', the young person chooses
'instant efficiency'. Thus, the non-medical use of psychotropic
drugs may frequently be an abortive and poorly directed attempt
by an emotionally sick person to treat his own condition. But
because he does not know precisely how, when and in what dosage
to apply these drugs, he not only usually fails in his attempts
but more often than not makes things worse. </p>

<p>351. In the language of ego psychology, a person's ability to
cope with external demands depends on his ego structure; that is,
that part of the personality which mediates between inner needs
and outer reality. Ego strength, in turn, depends on undisturbed
processes of growth, development and maturation throughout
childhood. Since a child is an extremely vulnerable organism,
disruptive early experiences may lead to imbalanced development
and result in a poorly adjusted personality structure. Such a
maladjusted person would then be inadequately equipped to deal
with the complex demands of today's world. </p>

<p>352. The Commission has very often been told by young people
that they reject all that is traditional conventional and
stereotyped, because they consider it to be hypocritical, phony,
dehumanizing, threatening, and ugly. As a result, they may,
become alienated and some may be plunged into a frantic search
for an identity which may be acceptable to them by their own
standards. This search for identity may go in two directions, one
leading to a pathological adjustment - the other simply to a
non-pathological parting from conformity. </p>

<p>In the pathological outcome, the individual may substitute a
spurious identity for an authentic one, for instance, by
accepting his belonging to a drug community as his new identity.
Also, by displacing his inner needs, projecting his aspirations
and denying his limitations, the person might settle for a
drug-induced illusion of false power, rather than real
achievement, and for chemically induced comfort rather than true
resolution of conflicts and tensions. </p>

<p>By contrast, in the non-pathological choice, the drug user may
opt exclusively for the inner world of personal experience and
genuine emotional awareness instead of the despised external
hall-marks of success in the world of our present-day society, as
we have often been told by young people. In making this choice,
the young individual apparently replaces the prevailing social,
technological and scientific values which require consensual
verification, with the immanent and immutable values of
emotional, interpersonal, spiritual, creative - but not
necessarily productive - achievement. It might well be reassuring
to him that personal experience, emotional awareness,
spirituality and creativeness are forever free from the danger of
being usurped by dehumanizing automation (the one power the
neo-nonconformist hates and fears perhaps more than anything
else, as we have repeatedly been told). However, this choice of
deliberate withdrawal and restructuring of his value system is
probably only open to a highly differentiated, sensitive and
introspective person. </p>

<p>353. Many others who reject today's society probably do so for
more personal and less philosophical reasons - for instance,
because of unresolved conflicts with their parents and with
authority in general. Many also adopt more pathological defences,
rather than an orderly withdrawal, as their way of rejecting the
'establishment'. Such defences - when induced and sustained by
psychotropic drugs - may consist in the vicarious building of an
illusionary world with LSD or in frenzied and aggressive
overstimulation with the help of 'speed', or in a passive walling
off and isolation of the self from all contacts, with cannabis. </p>

<p>354. Even more pathological responses may occur as disguised
self-destructive behaviour. For instance, some 'speed' users who
inject almost suicidal doses of methamphetamine into their veins
without any regard for their safety and health, may actually be
trying to test the truth of the youth slogan 'Speed Kills'. The
role of the doomed person who is at once a martyr sacrificing
himself, a hero braving the confrontation with certain
destruction and a gambler playing dice with death, is a role
which seems to have a strong seductive pull for some young people
who are morbidly hungry for compassion, admiration and
excitement. For these individuals the slogan 'Speed Kills', may,
paradoxically, carry more attractive than deterrent power - and
thus may not serve the purpose for which it is being promoted. </p>

<p>355. The sick individual who relies on cannabis, speed or
other psychotropic drugs, almost as his only means of escape, who
uses them always as a crutch, and structures his whole existence
around them as the only providers of pleasure (the 'pothead', the
'speed-freak, and the 'acidhead'), is in need of medical and
psychiatric, or psychological treatment. Prolonged counselling,
psychotherapy and comprehensive social follow-up care are usually
required. Medically prescribed and supervised drug treatment may
also be indicated in many cases. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the neo-noncomformist who is using drugs
but is not sick in the medical or psychiatric sense, may not need
treatment. If it seems desirable to bring about a change in his
behaviour, only a philosophical and spiritual reorientation,
which would have to touch the cultural roots of his values and
existential attitudes, could achieve this goal. </p>

<h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>

<hr>

<p>Law may be rooted in fiction as well as fact. Indeed, a public
policy conceived in ignorance may be continuously reaffirmed,
ever more vehemently, so long as its origins remain obscure or
its fallacy unexposed. Yet once a spark of truth ignites the
public opinion process, the authority of time will not stay the
flames of controversy. In stable times the policy may soon be
reversed or modified to comport with reality. In volatile times,
however, a single controversy may lose its urgency. Fueled by
flames generated by related public issues, the fire may spread;
truth may again be consumed in the explosive collision of
competing cultural ideologies. </p>

<p>So it has been with marijuana.' Suppressed for forty years
without significant public attention, the &quot;killer weed&quot;
has suddenly surfaced as the preferred euphoriant of millions of
Americans. Hardly a day passes without public exposure to
propaganda from one side or the other. Hardly a day passes
without arrests of newsworthy figures for violations of marijuana
laws. Before legislatures and courts, the law is attacked and
defended with equal fervor. Sociological, medical and police
testimony regarding the drug's effects is delivered feverishly to
an attentive public. </p>

<p>Yet, apart from some expedient peripheral actions, little has
been done. Detailed studies have been commissioned, but there has
been no significant reconsideration of basic assumptions. Because
the marijuana issue has become ensnared in broader social
polemics, it has been stalemated. Stability and change, defiance
and repression, hippieism and middle-Americanism, &quot;law and
order&quot; and protest politics define the cultural milieu of
which the marijuana issue is viewed as but a symptom. </p>

<p>This Article is motivated by twin concerns: that the flagrant
disregard of marijuana laws bespeaks a growing disenchantment
with the capacity of our legal system rationally to order
society, and that the assimilation of the marijuana issue into
larger social conflicts has consigned the debate to the public
viscera instead of the public mind. Through a historical analysis
of the marijuana laws we hope to refocus the debate. An
understanding of the origins of the laws might modulate the
challengers' hostile accusations and at the same time promote in
legislators an awareness of their own responsibility. </p>

<p>For the purposes both of description and evaluation, law is
inseparable from the process by which it is adopted and the
values it manifests. Accordingly, our history focuses both on the
public policy formation process and on evolving patterns of our
culture. With respect to policy, formation, marijuana's legal
history is a significant illustration of the interaction of the
public opinion, legislative and judicial processes, and, in a
broader sense, the relation between folkways and gateways. With
respect to its value-content, the evolution of marijuana policy
reflects quite precisely emerging cultural attitudes toward
pluralism, privacy and individual pursuit of pleasure in an
increasingly mechanized and depersonalized technological society.
</p>

<hr>

<p>1Throughout its tumultuous history, the common name of the
cannabis drug has been spelled in numerous ways-marihuana,
meriguana, marijuana, marijuana. We will use the last spelling
because it appears most often in modern publications and conforms
more nearly to the Spanish. <br>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H. Whitebread, II<br>
</i></p>

<p><b>II. THE ANTECEDENTS: CRIMINALIZATION OF NARCOTICS And
ALCOHOL </b></p>

<hr>

<p>The restrictive public policy with respect to marijuana,
initiated in the late twenties and thirties and perpetuated to
the present day, has never been an isolated phenomenon. At each
stage of its development marijuana policy has been heavily
influenced by other social issues because the drug has generally
been linked with broader cultural patterns. Particularly at its
inception, nationwide anti-marijuana legislation and its fate in
the courts were inseparably linked with the earlier
anti-narcotics and prohibition experiences. In fact, the facility
with which marijuana policy was initiated directly related to the
astoundingly sudden and extreme alteration of public narcotics
and alcohol policy between 1900 and 1920. </p>

<p>In 1906 there were only three dry states, and judicial
precedent abounded for the proposition that the right to possess
alcohol for private consumption was an inalienable right. Yet, by
1917, twenty states had enacted prohibitionary legislation and
most others were contemplating it. Two years later the eighteenth
amendment and the Volstead Act had been enacted, and it was a
federal crime to possess alcohol even for the purpose of drinking
it within the home. Similarly, in 1900 only a handful of states
in any way regulated traffic in narcotic drugs-opium, cocaine,
morphine and heroin-even though all but heroin had been available
for a decade or more. Yet, by 1914, all states had enacted some
type of prohibitionary legislation, and the national government
had enacted the Harrison Narcotic Act. </p>

<p>There were many major differences between the temperance and
anti-narcotics movements. The temperance movement was a matter of
vigorous public debate; the anti-narcotics movement was not.
Temperance legislation was the product of a highly organized
nationwide lobby; narcotics legislation was largely ad hoc.
Temperance legislation was designed to eradicate known evils
resulting from alcohol abuse; narcotics legislation was largely
anticipatory. </p>

<p>On the other hand, there were striking similarities between
the two movements. Both were first directed against the evils of
large scale use and only later against all use. Most of the
rhetoric was the same: These euphoriants produced crime,
pauperism and insanity. Both began on the state level and later
secured significant congressional action. Both ultimately found
favor with the courts, provoking interchangeable dissenting
opinions. </p>

<p>We do not propose to unearth new truths about the events of
this period. However, we do believe that a familiarity with the
political and judicial response to the alcohol and narcotics
problems is essential to an understanding of the eventual
suppression of marijuana. We believe further that an
understanding of the relation between public opinion and any
sumptuary law is germane to a discussion of the predicament of
current marijuana legislation. Finally, since much of the current
debate about marijuana is focused on its harmful effects as
compared with those of narcotics and alcohol, the evolution of
public policy in those areas is particularly material.<br>
</p>

<p><i>A. A Review of the Temperance Movement</i> </p>

<p>Although aggressive prohibition campaigns had been mounted in
every state in 1851-69,1 and again in 1880-90, in 1903 only Maine
(1884), Kansas (1880) and North Dakota (1889) were completely dry
states.2 Ernest Cherrington, the chronicler par excellence of the
Prohibition movement, blamed the failure of the first thrust in
part on the intervention of the slavery question, which siphoned
the moral fervor of the people from the temperance movement .4
The failure of the second campaign he attributed to the inability
of the prohibition activists to compete politically with growing
liquor interests that dominated state and local governments.5 </p>

<p>By 1906, however, the progress of the anti-saloon arm of the
temperance movement in local option contests&quot; and the
adoption of alcohol prohibition by the people of Oklahoma in a
provision of their constitution ratified upon admission to
statehood 7 signalled a new crusade for state prohibitionary
legislation. The Oklahoma vote so &quot;electrified the moral
forces of other states&quot; 8 that by 1913 six additional states
had enacted statewide prohibition, and half of the remaining
states were contemplating action.9 </p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant development during this period
occurred on the national level. The Supreme Court had earlier
declared the police powers of the states, under which state
prohibition laws were enacted, impotent to prevent importation of
liquor from a wet state, of which there were still many, into a
dry state and to stay the sale and delivery of such liquor to the
buyer while in the original package.&quot; </p>

<p>After a congressional attempt to deal with the decision in
1890 aborted in the courts,&quot; the buyer of liquor shipped in
interstate commerce still had the right to receive and therefore
to use such liquor. But in 1913 Congress, by the Webb-Kenyon Act,
12 filled the gap by prohibiting the shipment of liquor from one
state to another to be used in violation of the laws of the
latter; dry states could thus enforce their prohibition laws The
mere passage of this law, according to against imported liquor.13
</p>

<p>Cherrington, committed Congress to a policy that recognized
the liquor traffic as an outlaw trade and indicated congressional
desire to assist the dry states. 14 </p>

<p>By November 1913, the tide had decidedly turned. More than
half the population and 71 percent of the area of the United
States were under prohibitionary laws.&quot;, Accordingly, the
Fifteenth National Convention of the Anti-Saloon League of
America unanimously endorsed immediate passage of National
Constitutional Prohibition, whereupon the National Temperance
Council was formed to combine the forces of the various
temperance organizations toward this end. 16 </p>

<p>By April 4, 1917, when a joint resolution was introduced in
the Senate proposing an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting
the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors
within the United States for beverage purposes, 17 eighty percent
of the territory of the United States was dry.&quot; Adopted by
the constitutional majorities of both houses on December 18,
1917, the eighteenth amendment was ratified by the thirty-sixth
state on January 16, 1919, and became effective on January 16,
1920.19 The Volstead Act,&quot; passed on October 28, 1919,
pursuant to section 2 of the eighteenth amendment, outlawed
possession of intoxicating liquor and therefore went
significantly beyond the amendment itself. </p>

<p>The National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (the
Wickersham Commission) attributed the passage of the eighteenth
amendment not to public opposition to use of intoxicating
beverages,&quot; although this was indeed the view of many of the
leaders of the movement, but rather to antipathy to three major
related evils: excessive consumption, political corruption and
licensed saloons .22 </p>

<p>Excessive use increased with the commercialization of
production and distribution, and the expansion of saloons. Public
resentment against the corrupting influence of the large liquor
dealers in local politics, especially in the larger cities,
tended to focus public attention on removing a cancer from the
body politic. Finally, the institution that most strongly aroused
public sentiment against liquor traffic was the licensed saloon,
itself the symbol of intemperance and corruption. Owned or
controlled by the large brewers or wholesalers, centers of
political activity, homes of commercialized vice, the saloons
were the betes noires of middle-American public opinion. </p>

<p>Because public opinion was largely opposed only to the
socio-political consequences of massive liquor traffic, the
enforcement of total abstinence under the eighteenth amendment
became increasingly difficult. By 1931 it was an accepted fact
that the upper and middle classes were &quot;drinking in large
numbers in quite frank disregard of the declared policy&quot; of
the Volstead Act.&quot; </p>

<p>The difficulties of securing compliance in such circumstances
were aggravated by an inadequately designed enforcement strategy,
24, public resentment of the lawless tactics of prohibition
agents, 25 and the lack of any sustained attempt at public
education.26 For twelve years, however, millions of dollars were
spent by federal and state governments in a fruitless effort to
secure compliance with the law. Contemporary legal observers were
particularly incensed by the dilution of constitutional
protections, especially those provided by the fourth amendment,
which was sanctioned by the courts in response to the &quot;felt
needs&quot; of securing compliance through enforcement alone.27 </p>

<p>Although many plans were advanced for changing the prohibition
laws to mitigate the lawlessness rampant during this period, as
late as 1931 even its most vigorous opponents felt that repeal of
the eighteenth amendment was politically unfeasible.28 By 1932,
however, public opinion had become so inflamed that the
Democratic National Convention included repeal in the party
platform.&quot;' Proposed by Congress on February 20, 1933, the
twenty-first amendment was ratified by the thirty sixth state on
December 5, 1933.<br>
</p>

<p><i>B. Anti-Narcotics Legislation to 1914</i> </p>

<p>For our purposes, the major feature of temperance history is
the responsiveness of the political process to public opinion.
Whether or not a majority of Americans ever favored prohibition
and whether or not the thrust of public opinion was ever
accurately assessed, the public opinion process was attuned to
the question for half a century. The alleged evils of alcohol
abuse were matters of public knowledge; the proper governmental
response was a subject of endless public debate; enactment and
repeal of Prohibition were attended by widespread public
participation. </p>

<p>In contrast, the early narcotics legislation was promulgated
largely in a vacuum. Public and even professional ignorance of
the effects of narcotic drugs contributed both to the dimensions
of the problem and the nature of the legislated cure. The initial
legislation was attended by no operation of the public opinion
process, and instead generated a new public image of narcotics
use. Only after this creation of a public perception occurred did
the legislative approach comport with what we shall call latent
public opinion. <br>
</p>

<p><i>1. Narcotics Use at the Turn of the Century: A Growing
Problem <br>
</i></p>

<p>Although estimates have varied widely regarding the number of
persons regularly using cocaine, opium, morphine and heroin
during the pre-criminalization period, a sufficiently accurate
figure can be drawn from a composite of contemporary surveys30
conducted between 1878 and 1924 .31 Estimates range from 182,215
(1884) to 782,118 (1913). We can safely estimate that there were
between one-quarter and one-half million Americans addicted to
narcotics around the turn of the century, comprising at least one
percent of the population.&quot; </p>

<p>This rather large addict population included more females than
males,33 more whites than blacks,&quot; and was confined neither
to particular geographical regions nor to areas of high
population concentrations Its most significant characteristic was
its predominantly middle-class composition. Such attributes
contrast starkly with the overwhelmingly black, lower-class male
addict population that today inhabits our major urban centers. </p>

<p>Nineteenth century narcotics addiction was generally
accidental. It is widely believed that medical addicts far
outnumbered &quot;kicks&quot; or pleasure&quot; addicts.37
Medical addiction stemmed from many sources. The first was
overmedication. Civil War hospitals used opium and morphine
freely and many veterans returned addicted to the drugs.&quot;
Overmedication continued long after peace had been restored, due
to the ready availability of these drugs with and sometimes
without prescription. Since physicians were free to dispense
these drugs as painkillers, persons given morphine first for
legitimate therapeutic purposes often found themselves addicted.
39 This problem was exacerbated by the absence of restrictions
upon druggists in refilling prescriptions containing extensive
amounts of morphine and other opiates40 and by the introduction
of the hypodermic syringe.&quot; The danger of overmedication
increased in 1884 when cocaine was first introduced into the
practice of medicine, and again in 1898 when an advance in German
chemistry produced heroin, a partially synthetic morphine
derivative. 42 For a time recommended as a treatment for morphine
addiction ,43 heroin was also widely used for medicinal purposes.
</p>

<p>A second source of accidental addiction was the use and
popularity of patent medicines. Exotically labeled elixirs were
advertised as general cures for- ills ranging from snake bite to
melancholia. By containing up to thirty or forty percent morphine
or opiates by volume, most patent medicines fulfilled their
cure-all promises. However, a heavy price was exacted for such
cures. In the absence of a requirement that contents be printed
on the label, many an unsuspecting person became addicted without
ever knowing the medicine that worked so well contained dangerous
narcotics.44 </p>

<p>Thus, careless prescription, incessant dispensation and hidden
distribution of harmful drugs, the addictive effects of which
were unknown until too late, fostered a large addict population
which continued to increase in the early twentieth century. The
increase in narcotics consumption, and therefore addiction, is
well illustrated by the fact that 628,177 pounds of opiates were
brought into this country in 1900, three times the amount
imported thirty years earlier.&quot; Governmental and medical
default explains the innocent nature of nineteenth century
narcotics addiction and therefore its predominantly middle-class,
nationwide character. </p>

<p>Not all addiction was accidental and private. It has been
suggested that both medical knowledge and governmental regulation
occurred only when each narcotic drug achieved a significant
degree of &quot;street&quot; use. Our research supports this
thesis, especially when &quot;street&quot; use is identified with
the poor and with racial minorities. For example, opium, the drug
first determined addictive and first identified with &quot;
pleasure&quot; use, was the earliest prohibited. Legislation was
first passed in the west coast states with newly immigrated
Chinese populations among whom its use was prevalent. Heroin
early achieved a widespread nonmedical or &quot;street&quot; use,
especially in large urban centers among lower-class males.&quot;'
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, addiction, even to opium, was predominantly
involuntary until 1900. Professional attention was not focused
directly on! Street&quot; use until after two developments had
significantly reduced the: possibility of medical addiction.
First, the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act48 in 1906 led to
the demise of the patent medicine industry,: one of the primary
causes of medical addiction. The labeling requirements of the
Act, coupled with the later regulation of the production and
distribution of the opiates, protected the public from the
dangers of ignorance and virtually put the patent medicine
industry out of business.49 Second, the discovery of new
nonaddictive pain killers and anesthetics reduced the likelihood
of post-operative addiction since physicians no longer needed to
rely so heavily on morphine and opium. preparations to reduce and
control pain.<br>
</p>

<p>2. State Legislative Response Before 1914 </p>

<p>Although many states regulated narcotics indirectly through
their general &quot;poison laws&quot; before 1870,50 the first
anti-narcotics legislation did not appear until the last quarter
of the nineteenth century. Most of the early legislation focused
primarily on crime prevention&quot; and public education
regarding the dangers of drug use.&quot; The spread of opium
smoking, especially in the western states with high oriental
populations,53 provoked legislation in eighteen states between
1877 and 1911 designed to eradicate the practice either by
preventing the operation of opium dens or by punishing the
smoking of opium altogether. 54 As the addictive qualities of
opium, cocaine, morphine and later heroin became known, primarily
through observation of &quot;street&quot; use, concerned
physicians finally began to agitate for stricter regulation than
that provided by the &quot;poison laws,&quot; even though such
laws included opium and cocaine. Nevada enacted the first law
prohibiting the retail sale of opiates for nonmedical purposes in
1877.55 In 1887, Oregon prohibited sale of cocaine without a
prescription,&quot;&quot; and seven states followed suit by the
turn of the century57 as did thirty-nine more by 1914.58 However,
only twenty-nine states had included opiates in their
prohibitionary legislation by 1914.59 </p>

<p>With the exception of the Oregon schemes nineteenth century
narcotic laws did not attempt to restrict or prohibit possession
of narcotics, and were directed solely at distribution and sale.
By 1913, only six states had prohibited the mere possession of
restricted drugs by unauthorized persons .61 Three additional
states prohibited possession with intent illegally to dispense
such drugs .62 <br>
</p>

<p>3. Watershed: The Passage of the Harrison Act </p>

<p>The first national legislation designed to regulate narcotics
distribution, the 1909 &quot;Act to Prohibit Importation and Use
Of Opium&quot;' 63 barred the importation of opium at other than
specified ports and for other than medicinal use. The law further
required the keeping of import records. The main force behind the
passage of this statute was a desire to bring the United States
into line with other nations that had signed international
conventions against the use of the drug. 64 However, as state
anti-narcotics legislation began to take on crusade proportions,
pressure was generated for federal regulation of the importation
of opium for medicinal purposes and of the interstate trade in
cocaine, morphine and heroin. Consequently, the Harrison Act,
until this year the foundation of federal law controlling
narcotic drugs, was passed in 1914.65 </p>

<p>The Harrison Act, a taxing measure, required registration and
payment of an occupational tax by all persons who imported,
produced, dealt in, sold or gave away opium, cocaine or their
derivatives. The Act required all legitimate handlers of these
narcotics to file returns setting forth in detail their use of
the drugs. Each legitimate handler was required to use a special
order form in making any transfer of narcotics. Since the Act
also provided that only legitimate users could register and no
one but a registered user could obtain the specified form, any
transfer by an illegitimate user was a violation of the Act. For
those failing to comply with its registration requirements, the
original Harrison Act provided penalties of not more than $2,000
in fines or more than five years imprisonment, or both. </p>

<p>The passage of the Harrison Act was the culmination of
increasing concern in the medical profession66 about the freedom
with which physicians prescribed and druggists dispensed
addictive drugs, primarily morphine and heroin. During the period
of little or no regulation, the innocent addicts were regarded as
victims of an unfortunate sickness in need of treatment; usually
they could find a friendly physician or druggist willing to
sustain their habits. The passage of the Harrison Act, however,
by imposing a stamp of illegitimacy on most narcotics use,
fostered an image previously associated primarily with opium that
of the degenerate dope fiend with immoral proclivities. As the
regulation of physicians and druggists became more stringent,
especially after the Supreme Court held that prevention of
withdrawal was not a legitimate medical use that a prescription
to an unregistered person,67 this image fulfilled itself. All
addicts, whether accidental or pleasure-seeking, were shut off
from their supply and had to turn underground to purchase the
drugs. Inflated underground prices often provoked criminal
activity and this activity in turn evoked in the public a moral
response,, cementing the link between iniquity and. drug
addiction.68 </p>

<p>The early clinical experiments dealing with narcotics
addiction were inevitable victims of enforcement of the
Act.&quot; The concept that underlay the clinical effort-that
addiction was a medical problem to be dealt with by sustaining
the addict cheaply while trying to induce gentle withdrawal-was
antithetical to the attitude provoking the criminal
classification of unlawful possessors of narcotic drugs.&quot;
Clinics were run .in such cities as New York, Shreveport and
Jacksonville,&quot; but by 1923 all were closed, thus removing
still another legitimate source of supply for the addict. Again,
the crimes committed to enable these people to tap I the illicit
sources increased public hysteria and misunderstanding 72 about
the link between the opiates and crime. </p>

<p>Another result of the physicians' resignation to pressure was
that addicts to the opiates began to commit petty crimes in order
to secure the drugs which could prevent their suffering. These
inevitable law-induced crimes greatly accentuated the general
public belief that opiates had some inherent sinister property
which could change normal people into moral perverts and
criminals. </p>

<p>In addition to redefining the public conception of narcotic
addiction in a way that would not be seriously challenged for
half a century, the Harrison Act also provided a strange model
for the administration of narcotics laws which would
significantly affect future developments' Drafted as a tax law
rather than an outright criminal statute, the Act was intended to
do indirectly what Congress believed it could not do
directly-regulate possession and sale of the opiates. Indeed,
congressional caution was justified. A five-to-four decision by
the Supreme Court in the 1903 Lottery Case73 suggested what later
became fact-the Court, as self-appointed arbiter of the federal
system, would plant the tenth amendment in the path of
congressional regulation of &quot;local&quot; affairs. That
direct regulation of medical practice was indeed considered
beyond congressional power under the commerce clause is clearly
indicated in contemporary opinions. First, in its 1918 decision
in Hammer V. Dagenhart,74 the Court held the Child Labor Act
unconstitutional. Second, the Court ultimately upheld the
Harrison Act as a valid exercise of the taxing power 75 only by a
five-to-four margin. Finally, there is some fairly explicit
language about congressional regulation of medical practice in
subsequent Harrison Act opinions.76 </p>

<p>This indirect regulation of narcotics traffic under the
pretext of raising revenue had a number of significant
consequences. First, since the Act could not penalize users or
addiction directly, there was an immediate need for complementary
residual state legislation in order to deal effectively with the
drug problem. Second, the enforcement of the Act was necessarily
assigned to the Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury
Department. </p>

<p>The first enforcement agency for the Harrison Act was the
Narcotics Division of the Prohibition Unit of the Internal
Revenue Service created in 1920.77 This division was incorporated
in the Prohibition Bureau which was created in 1927 .78 In 1930,
the enforcement of the narcotics laws was severed from the Bureau
of Prohibition and established as the separate Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department .79 The existence of this
separate agency anxious to fulfill its role as crusader against
the evils of narcotics has done as much as any single factor to
influence the course of drug regulation from 1930 to 1970.&quot;
Although the impact of the Bureau on the passage of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act and the Marihuana Tax Act will be explained in
detail in subsequent sections, it is important here to note that
the existence of a separate bureau having responsibility only for
narcotics enforcement and for educating the public on drug
problems inevitably led to a particularly prosecutorial view of
the narcotics addict. Moreover, this creation of the Bureau
separate from the newly created FBI in the justice Department
unnecessarily bifurcated federal law enforcement operations in
this area. </p>

<p>C. The Judicial Role and the Constitutional Framework: </p>

<p>The Police Power and Intoxicant Prohibition to 1920 </p>

<p>It is not novel to suggest that the fate of contemporary
constitutional challenges to marijuana prohibition depends in
part on a judicial reading of public opinion as well as on the
availability of a constitutional peg on which to hang an
&quot;activist&quot; judicial inquiry. Since contextual pressure
and analytical conflict were also central elements of the
'Judicial response to alcohol and narcotics prohibition between
1850 and 1920, it is worthwhile to trace that response. </p>

<p>As in today's court battles over marijuana laws, the clash
then was between two polar constitutional concepts-the police
powers of the state and allegedly &quot;fundamental&quot;
personal constitutional rights. The conflict opened on state
constitutional grounds and was continued in the realm of the
fourteenth amendment. On the issues of alcohol and
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics, the police power was triumphant. In
the light of the comparisons drawn in current constitutional
arguments among marijuana , alcohol and narcotics, an inquiry
into the long struggle is informative. </p>

<p>1. Phase One: Prohibition of Sale and Manufacture of Alcohol </p>

<p>During the first wave of prohibitionist legislation in the
1850's, thirteen en states outlawed manufacture&quot; and sale of
intoxicating beverages.&quot; The constitutionality of such laws
under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution had been
presaged in the License Case83 in 1847, where in six separate
opinions the Supreme Court upheld Massachusetts, New Hampshire
and Rhode Island laws regulating wholesale and retail sales of
liquor. Chief Justice Taney's famous dictum stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>And if any State deems the retail and internal traffic in
    ardent spirits injurious to its citizens, and calculated to
    produce idleness, vice, or debauchery, I see nothing, in the
    constitution of the United States to prevent it from
    regulating and restraining the traffic, or from prohibiting,
    it altogether, if it thinks proper.84 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armed with this pronouncement, the courts of eight states
rebuffed challenges under their own constitutions.&quot; Some of
these decisions gave scant attention to the constitutional
argument but simply defined the police power broad terms86 and
perhaps cited the Taney dictum. </p>

<p>However, the rationale and rhetoric of those decisions
squarely rejecting the constitutional objections merit a detailed
comparison with that of two decisions, in New York88 and
Indiana89, declaring the statutes void. </p>

<p>Even the opponents of the laws acknowledged the potential
public evils of intemperance90crime, pauperism and vice-the
eradication of which was the objective of prohibitionary
legislation. Yet they argued that the means employed to
accomplish this end-prevention of sale was beyond the police
power. Alcohol had admittedly beneficial use91 and was harmful
only when abused.92 In order to eliminate it from channels of
commerce, thereby depriving its owners of a -fundamental incident
of ownership-the right to sell93 -a more pernicious character had
to be shown. 94 Accordingly, the public benefit did not justify
the restriction of private rights. The criminalization of sale of
alcohol beverages constituted a deprivation of
&quot;property&quot; without due process;95 or, failing that, it
constituted an infringement of the inalienable right of 1ife,
liberty And the pursuit of happiness rooted in the precepts of
natural justice that the people reserved to themselves when they
entered into the social compact.96 New York, in Wynehamer v.
People,97 accepted .the due process argument, at least with
respect to alcohol lawfully acquired, and Indiana endorsed the
inalienable rights argument in Beebe v. State.98 </p>

<p>The virtues of judicial restraint were vehemently defended in
the decisions rejecting these arguments: The courts uniformly
refused to interfere with the discretionary exercise of the
police power in the absence of a specific constitutional
prohibition. The Vermont Supreme Court view was typical: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The legislature in passing the law in question doubtless
    supposed that the traffic and drinking of intoxicating
    liquors went hand in hand ... and that, by cutting off the
    one, the other would also fall with it. Whether the drinking
    of intoxicating liquors tends to produce intemperance and
    whether the intemperance is a gangrene, tending to corrupt
    the moral health of the body politic, and to produce misery
    and lamentation; and whether the law in question is well
    calculated to cut off or mitigate the evils supposed to flow
    directly from intemperance and indirectly from the traffic in
    intoxicating liquors, were questions to be settled by the
    lawmaking power; and their decision in this respect is final
    and not to be reviewed by us.99 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this view, societal self-protection, the essence of the
police power, is broadly defined.100 So long as the legislature
determines that the use of alcoholic beverages exerts an adverse
effect on public, health, safety or morals, the courts may
question neither the factual determination nor the means employed
to restrict that use. In answer to the argument that the courts
have a special obligation to review the relation between means
and ends where personal liberties are curtailed, these courts
disavowed any power &quot;to annul a legislative Act upon higher
grounds than those of express constitutional restriction,&quot;
101 or, after assuming for sake of argument the existence of such
power, they declined to exercise It.102 In response to the
argument accepted by Judge Comstock in Wynehamer v. New York-that
prohibition of sale of legally acquired alcohol was a deprivation
of property without due process of law-most courts distinguished
Wynehamer on its facts,103 held that no essential
&quot;property&quot; right had been violated,&quot;&quot; or
construed &quot;due process&quot; to refer only to due procedure
and not to the &quot;power ... to create and define an
offense.&quot; 105 </p>

<p>Two polar conceptions of the scope of 'Judicial review clashed
over a subject of intense public interest. The immediate question
was settled in favor of the constitutionality of prohibiting
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages; in fact, the Indiana
court itself disavowed its contrary decision in Beebe three years
after rendering it.106 However, the jurisprudential dialogue107
had merely begun. Today, Wynehamer is regarded as the initial
step, on the road to the vested rights conception of due process.
Similarly, Beebe is the philosophical ancestor of all challenges
to prohibition of intoxicants alcohol, narcotics, and
marijuana.108 </p>

<p>With the passage of the fourteenth amendment, the Supreme
Court was called upon to determine whether prohibitionary
exercises of the state police powers were now limited by federal
law. The battle fought in the 1850's on state constitutional
grounds was refought in the 1870's and 80's on federal
territory-with the same outcome. In a series of cases culminating
in Mugler v. Kansas,109 it slowly became settled that the
manufacturer or seller of intoxicating liquors had no
constitutional rights under either the privileges and immunities
or due process clauses that could prevent the operation of the
police power of the state, regardless whether the liquor was
bought or manufactured before passage of the law or even whether
it was manufactured solely for personal use.110 </p>

<p>Thus, as a matter of both state and federal constitutional
law, the courts required no more, and probably less, than that
legislation be designed to retard a public evil-here pauperism
and crime-and be rationally related to that end.&quot;' Absent a
specific constitutional limitation, it did not concern the courts
that such regulations affronted personal liberty and property
rights. The theoretical Justification of incidental curtailment
of private liberties in the public interest was that the
legislature must conduct the balancing; if the balance is
unsound, the law will be repealed. Indeed, the courts were
probably willing to indulge that presumption as a practical
matter since the passage of the prohibition laws was preceded by
vigorous public debate. In fact, the public opinion process did
work in reaction to these curtailments of private liberty, and
most such laws were subsequently repealed&quot;' in the ensuing
decade. </p>

<p>2. Phase Two: Probibition of Sale of Opium </p>

<p>As noted above, the first prohibitionary narcotics legislation
was enacted on the west coast in the 1880's in order to prohibit
sale and distribution of opium for nonmedical purposes. The
racial overtonesof this legislation were self-consciously
acknowledged by the initial Oregon and Nevada decisions.
Sustaining the conviction of an alien for selling opium in Ex
parte Yung Jon,&quot;' the Oregon district court noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Smoking opium is not our vice, and therefore it may be
    that this legislation proceeds more from a desire to vex and
    annoy the &quot;Heathen Chinee&quot; in this respect, than to
    protect the people from the evil habit. But the motives of
    legislators cannot be the subject of judicial investigation
    for the purpose of affecting the validity of their acts. 114 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The opium laws were attacked on precisely the same grounds as
had been the alcohol prohibition legislation. The Nevada court
had no trouble in State v. Ah Chew;115 it simply cited the
License Cases, the Delaware decision sustaining prohibition of
alcohol sale, and distinguished Wynebamer as holding only that
the sale of lawfully acquired property could not be prohibited.
Within this framework, the result was obvious: </p>

<p>It is not denied that the indiscriminate use of opium . . .
tends in a much greater degree to demoralize the persons using
it, to dull the moral senses, to foster vice and produce crime,
than the sale of intoxicating drinks. If such is its tendency, it
should not have unrestrained license to produce such disastrous
results.... Under the police power . . . in the interest of good
morals, the good order and peace of society, for the prevention
of crime, misery and want, the legislature has authority to place
such restrictions upon sale or disposal of opium a,, will
mitigate, if not suppress, its evils to society.116 </p>

<p>The Oregon court, in the Yung Jon decision five years later,
did not take the easy way out. The court was apparently not
disposed to imply that sale of previously owned alcohol and
cigarettes could be prohibited, and thus reject outright the
Wynebamer conception of due process;117 instead it chose to hold
that sale of opium for nonmedical purposes was not an incident of
ownership and, since the law did not prohibit sale for medical
purposes, no property right was deprived. Not as cautious as his
brethren, Judge Deady inquired more actively into the nature of
opium before upholding the legislation. Whether a legislative act
is &quot;prohibitory&quot; (and by implication whether it
violates the due process clause) &quot;must depend on
circumstances, and particularly the character of the article, and
the uses and purposes to which it has generally been applied in
the community.&quot; 118 He then noted that opium was primarily a
medicinal drug; that although used in the East for centuries as
an intoxicant, that use was new in the United States and confined
primarily to the Chinese; that it was classed as a poison and was
less easily detected than alcoholic intoxication, &quot;which it
is said to replace where law and custom have made the latter
disreputable;&quot; and that its &quot;evil effects&quot; were
manifest upon the nervous and digestive systems, resembling
delirium tremens. Thus, there was no longstanding regard of opium
as a legitimate article of property except for medical use.
Accordingly, the act does not in effect prohibit the disposition
of the drug, but allows it under such circumstances, and on such
conditions, as will, according to the general practice and
opinions of the country, prevent its improper and harmful use.119
</p>

<p>Thus, whatever the judicial propensity to limit the police
power in the interest of property rights, prohibition of traffic
in opium-worse than alcohol and confined to aliens-violated no
implied or express constitutional limitations.<br>
</p>

<p>3. Phase Three: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol to 1915 </p>

<p>At this stage of constitutional jurisprudence, criminalization
of possession or consumption of alcohol or narcotics was arguably
a deprivation of property without due process of law. The first
wave of prohibition cases had held only that the right to sell
even previously acquired liquor was not an essential element of
ownership. They had not held that the state could forbid the
essential attribute of ownership-the right to use. In fact, many
courts had expressly noted that alcohol was still a legitimate
article of property.120 </p>

<p>Until 1915 the weight of authority was that it was beyond the
police power to prohibit mere possession of alcoholic beverages
unless the quantity Justified an inference that they were held
for sale. A few cases so held ;121 many courts so stated in
dictum, while holding the laws either in conflict with particular
constitutional provisions regarding the &quot;sale&quot; of
liquor&quot;122 or in excess of the power of municipal
corporations;&quot; and many contemporary commentators so stated
.124 </p>

<p>Although the due process rationale was sometimes employed, 125
the preferred approach was &quot;inherent&quot; limitation. In
his 1904 treatise, Police Power, Ernst Freund premised the
&quot;inherent&quot; limitation of noninterference with purely
private conduct not on any inalienable natural right but on the
requirement that interference be justified on grounds of the
public welfare.&quot;' This and the &quot;practical difficulties
of enforcement, coupled with the constitutional prohibition of
unreasonable searches,&quot; 127 would sufficiently deter
legislative abuse. </p>

<p>Absent the addition of a natural rights notion, however, this
decisional frame becomes ambivalent on the dispositive question
in an adjudication questioning such legislative
&quot;abuse&quot;: Can the mere &quot;policy&quot; of
nonintervention with private conduct a more rigorous judicial
inquiry into the relation between the prohibited private acts and
the alleged public evil? If it cannot, the constitutional attack
on prohibition of possession is no stronger than that on
prohibition of sale. If it can, is not the judicial role subject
to the same charge of usurpation as it would be if the courts
employed a pure natural rights approach? </p>

<p>In any event, when the courts first confronted possession
prohibition, the rhetoric was varied-due process, 128 natural
rights&quot;' and private liberty&quot;&quot;-but the approach
was the same-a refusal to accept the legislative findings as to
the relation between private act and public harm and a refusal to
defer to the legislative balance of private liberty and public
need. For example, in one of the leading cases, Commonwealth v.
Campbell,&quot;' the Court of Appeals of Kentucky cited Cooley,
Mill, and Blackstone for the proposition that </p>

<p>[i]t is not within the competency of government to invade the
privacy of the citizen's life and to regulate his conduct in
matters in which he alone is concerned, or to prohibit him any
liberty the exercise of which will not directly injure
society.132 </p>

<p>Noting next that defendant was &quot;not charged with having
the liquor in his possession for the purpose of selling it, or
even giving it to another&quot; and that &quot;ownership and
possession cannot be denied when that ownership and possession is
not in itself injurious to the public,&quot; 133 the court
concluded that </p>

<p>the right to use liquor for one's own comfort, if the use is
without direct injury to the public, is one of the citizen's
natural and inalienable rights .... We hold that the police
power-vague and wide and undefined as it is-has limits . . . 134 </p>

<p>The key to this reasoning, of course, is the court's
insistence that the injury be direct as measured according to a
Judicial yardstick. Although the court devoted little attention
to the question, it implicitly rejected arguments that the only
way to exorcize the public evils attending excessive use and
adequately to enforce prohibitions against sale was to prevent
any private use at all. The court impliedly held that the posited
connection, albeit rational, was &quot;remote&quot; or
&quot;indirect&quot; or &quot;unreasonable&quot; and therefore
entitled to no deference. 135<br>
</p>

<p>4. Phase Four: Prohibition of Possession of Narcotics </p>

<p>This active 'Judicial role in alcohol cases should be compared
with the courts' simultaneous refusals to second-guess
legislative &quot;findings&quot; with regard to the
criminalization of possession of opium. In a series of cases
decided in Washington, Oregon and California136 in 1890, 1896 and
1911 respectively, courts held that the relation between
narcotics use and public harm was to be drawn by the legislature.
</p>

<p>In answer to the argument, accepted in the alcohol cases, that
despite the absence of explicit constitutional limitations the
police power of prohibition was inherently limited to acts which
&quot;involve direct and immediate injury to another,&quot; 137
the courts replied in predictable fashion: The state may prevent
a weak man from doing injury to himself if it determines that
such injury may cause the individual to become a &quot;burden on
society;&quot; &quot;' the state could find that excessive use of
opium, an active poison, would debase the moral and economic
welfare of' the society by causing ill health, pauperism and
insanity;... the state could find that the potential for and
evils attending excessive use demand a prohibition also of
nondeleterious moderate use.&quot;' Accordingly, in the words of
the Supreme Court of Washington, </p>

<p>[i]t is for the legislature to place on foot the inquiry as to
just in what degree the use is injurious; to collate all the
information and to make all the needful and necessary
calculations. These are questions of fact with which the court
cannot deal. The constitutionality of laws is not thus to be
determined .141 </p>

<p>The California court had more difficulty with the argument
that punishment of possession of alcohol had been held beyond the
police power. Despite its rhetoric regarding the wide bounds of
legislative fact-finding, the court actually made its own
determination that public injury from private abuse was more
likely with narcotics than alcohol. The lower court had said so
overtly: </p>

<p>But liquor is used daily in this and other countries as a
beverage, moderately and without harm, by countless thousands ...
; whereas it appears there is no such thing as moderation in the
use of opium. Once the habit is formed the desire for it is
insatiable, and its use is invariably disastrous. 142 </p>

<p>The California Supreme Court shied away: </p>

<p>We do not understand this to have been intended to declare an
established or conceded fact. So interpreted, the expression
would be, perhaps unduly sweeping. But the validity of
legislation which would be necessary or proper under a given
state of facts does not depend upon the actual existence of the
supposed facts. It is enough if the law-making body may
rationally believe such facts to be established. If the belief
that the use of opium, once begun, almost ]Inevitably leads to
excess may be entertained by reasonable men-and we do not doubt
that it may-such belief affords a sufficient 'Justification for
applying to opium restrictions which might be unduly burdensome
in the case of other substances, as, for example, intoxicating
liquors, the use of which may fairly be regarded as less
dangerous to their users or to the public. 143 </p>

<p>What the court said is unobjectionable. What it did not say,
however, is significant. This reasoning implies that if the
legislature should determine that the potential for excessive use
of alcohol-and consequently for the public evils of pauperism,
crime and insanity-is great enough to prohibit all use, that
judgment would have to stand. Probably not intending so to
suggest, the court really held that it thought that opium use was
more likely adversely to affect the public welfare than alcohol
use; accordingly, paternal criminal legislation was
&quot;reasonable&quot; in the former case and not in the latter,
even though they were identically &quot;Indirect.&quot; It
helped, perhaps, that the legislature was not telling the and his
white, middle-class colleagues that they shouldn't smoke opium,
and that the objective was merely to prevent a few &quot;Heathen
Chinee&quot; from hurting themselves through their stupidity and
from spreading their nasty habit to the whites.&quot;' </p>

<p>The only astounding thing about the opium possession cases is
that there was at least one dissenting opinion. In the Washington
case, Ah Lim v. Territory,145 judge Scott, for himself and
another judge, insisted on either a more conclusive demonstration
that the private act of smoking opium &quot;directly and clearly
affected the public in some manner&quot; or a more narrowly drawn
statute. He catalogued the alleged public justifications: </p>

<p>That smoking or inhaling opium injures the health of the
individual, and in this way weakens the state; that it tends to
the increase of pauperism. That it destroys the moral sentiment
and leads to the commission of crime. In other words, that it has
an injurious effect upon the individual, and, consequently,
results indirectly in an injury to the community. 146 </p>

<p>After noting the insufficiency of all of the 'Justifications
including the argument that the moderate desires of some must be
sacrificed to prevent abuse by others, 147 then concluded: </p>

<p>[The Act] is altogether too sweeping in its terms. I make no
question but that the habit of smoking opium may be repulsive and
degrading. That its effect would be to shatter the nerves and
destroy the intellect; and that it may tend to the increase of
pauperism and crime. But there is a vast difference between the
commission of a single act, and a confirmed habit. There is a
distinction to be recognized between the use and abuse of any
article or substance.... If this act must be held valid it is
hard to conceive of any legislative action affecting the personal
conduct, or privileges of the individual citizen. that must not
be upheld. . . . The prohibited act cannot affect the public in
any way except through the primary personal injury to the
individual, if it occasions him any injury. It looks like a new
and extreme step under our government in the field of
legislation, if it really was passed for any of the purposes upon
which that character of legislation can be sustained, if at all.
148 </p>

<p>The sanctity of &quot;the personal conduct or privileges of
the individual &quot; had suffered first blow. The knockout was
only a few citizen rounds away.<br>
</p>

<p>5. Phase Five: Prohibition of Possession of Alcohol After 1915
</p>

<p>The year 1915 was the watershed year for prohibitionists in
the courts. </p>

<p>By 1913, the tide had finally turned in the state
legislatures, many of which prohibited possession of more than a
certain quantity of alcoholic beverages. The first of these
statutes to reach the courts was that of Alabama in Southern
Express Co. v. Whittle.149 </p>

<p>Overruling its earlier decision in Eidge v. City of
Bessemer,150 one of the leading cases during the earlier phase,
the Alabama court swept away all restraints on the police power.
So long as the legislation was directed at some legitimate
purpose and was not arbitrary, the court should not interfere.151
Whether or not the Supreme Court had so intended, the Alabama
court, like other state courts, relied heavily on justice
Harlan's opinion in Mugler v. Kansas,152 and gave its legislature
a blank check when exercising police powers: </p>

<p>If the right of common law to manufacture an intoxicating
liquor for one's own personal use, out of one's own materials by
the application of one's own personal effort, may be forbidden by
appropriate legislation under the police power, as was expressly
ruled in Mugler v. Kansas . . . . it cannot be logically or
soundly asserted that the receipt or possession of more than a
specified quantity at one time may not be forbidden by a statute
. . . . 153 </p>

<p>The alleged sanctity of private conduct gave the court little
pause; this was just I one of a number of instances </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>where ancillary prohibitions of acts and conduct, innocent
    in themselves, have been sustained and confirmed as an
    exercise of the police power of the state; and so upon the
    theory that some valid legislative purpose might be more
    certainly made effective, or that evasions of the laws might
    be prevented or hindered of accomplishment.154 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though the Alabama court did not do so, it could have cited
the opium possession cases as authority. Most courts did. </p>

<p>The Alabama decision was quickly followed in Idaho155 and in
nine other states.156 When the Idaho case, Crane v. Campbell,157
came before the Supreme Court, Justice McReynolds dealt the
knockout blow: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As the state has the power . . . to prohibit [sale and
    manufacture], it may adopt such measures as are reasonably
    appropriate or needful to render exercise of that power
    effective. And, considering the notorious difficulties always
    attendant upon efforts to suppress traffic in liquors, we are
    unable to say that the challenged inhibition of their
    possession was 'arbitrary and unreasonable or without proper
    relation to the legitimate legislative purposes 158 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle noted by Freund,159 that the police power did
not easily extend to matters of private conduct, was ignored: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I] t clearly follows from our numerous decisions
    upholding prohibition legislation that the right to hold
    intoxicating liquors for personal use is not one of those
    fundamental privileges of a citizen of the United States
    which no State may abridge. A contrary view would be
    incompatible with the undoubted power to prevent manufacture,
    gift, sale, purchase or transportation of such articles-the
    only feasible ways of getting them. An assured right of
    possession would necessarily imply some adequate method to
    obtain not subject to destruction at the will of the State.
    160 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the restrictive interpretation of the privileges and
immunities clause161 and the refusal to extend substantive due
process outside the economic area, 162 there was no existing
federal constitutional pigeonhole for &quot;private conduct&quot;
as a principle of constitutional limitation. And on the state
level the courts ignored the &quot;'intrinsic limitation&quot;
argument and discarded the direct-indirect yardstick in the wake
of the temperance movement. </p>

<p>The commentators were outraged. Again and again the courts
were indicted for interpreting constitutional precepts to
correspond with public opinion.163 The retreat on the temperance
question coincided perfectly with the final success of the
Prohibition movement. And the commentators were quite justified
in so noting. </p>

<p>It was merely icing on the cake when the Supreme Court upheld
the provision of the Volstead Act164 outlawing possession of
intoxicating liquor. The Court predictably rebuffed165 an
argument that it was beyond congressional power under section 2
of the eighteenth amendment to prohibit possession for personal
consumption of liquor owned before the passage of the Act.166 </p>

<p>6. A Postscript on the Police Power: The Cigarette Cases </p>

<p>Interestingly, the legislative solicitude for the health of
the citizenry during the period under discussion also extended to
the prohibition of cigarette smoking in several jurisdictions. In
1897, the General Assembly of Tennessee made it a misdemeanor to
sell, give away or otherwise dispose of cigarettes or cigarette
paper.167 The Supreme Court of Tennessee upheld the statute under
the police power on the grounds that cigarettes were not
legitimate articles of commerce, being &quot;inherently bad and
bad only.&quot; 168 The United States Supreme Court affirmed in
Austin v. Tennessee,169 primarily on the authority of the alcohol
and opium cases, noting that there need be only a rational basis
for the legislative determination that the commodity is harmful
to 'justify its prohibition.170 The Court did not even mention
any objection based on deprivation of property rights or personal
liberty. </p>

<p>The issue was posed more directly in Kentucky and Illinois
cases171 regarding the validity of local ordinances prohibiting
smoking of cigarettes &quot;within the corporate limits&quot; in
one case and &quot;in any street, alley, avenue ... park ... or
[other] public place&quot; in the other. Both courts held the
ordinances unreasonable interferences with personal liberty.172 </p>

<p>The argument that the ordinances were calculated to insure the
public safety by preventing fire hazards was held to be too
remote and the argument accepted in Austin regarding potential
injury to the smoker's health apparently was not made or at least
went unacknowledged by both courts. </p>

<p>These decisions, rendered in. 1911 and 1914, were probably
consistent, under a direct-indirect injury to society theory,
with Austin and with the alcohol and narcotics cases up to that
time. The post-1915 alcohol possession cases, however, undermined
any such distinction. insofar as it authorized a more active
judicial inquiry into the relationship between the private
conduct and the public need. At least at this stage of its
development it may be fruitless to seek out a &quot;neutral
principle&quot; beyond common sense regarding the undefined
constitutional limitations on the police power. Professor Brooks
Adams noted in 1913 that the scope of the police power could not
be determined in advance by abstract reasoning. Hence. as, each
litigation arose, the judges could follow no rule but the rule of
common sense, and the Police Power, translated into plain English
presently came to signify whatever, at the moment, the judges
happened to think reasonable. Consequently, they began guessing
at the drift of public opinion, as it percolated to them through
the medium of their education and prejudices. Sometimes they
guessed right and sometimes wrong, and when they guessed wrong
they were cast aside, as appeared dramatically enough in the
temperance agitation .173 </p>

<p>And justice Holmes noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It may be said in a general way that the police power
    extends to all the great public needs. It may be put forth in
    aid of what is sanctioned by usage, or held by the prevailing
    morality or strong and preponderant opinion to be greatly and
    immediately necessary to the public welfare.174 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the development of the Judicial response to exercises
of the police power at the time was the result of the changing
public opinion or a changing analytical framework, trends in that
response were evident. It remains to be seen whether any trends
are evident today to indicate how marijuana users will fare in
the future.<br>

<p>31 The earliest attempt at a compilation of addiction figures
was undertaken by O. Marshall in 1878. Marshall, The <i>Opium
Habit in Michigan, </i>1878 MICH. STATE BD. OF<br>
HEALTH ANN. REP. 61-73. From questionnaires sent to doctors,
Marshall found 1,313 users of opium or morphine and concluded
therefrom that there were 7,763 addicts in the state. Dr. Charles
Terry later concluded that, if Marshall's figures were
representative, total incidence of addiction in the United States
in 1878 was 251,936. C. TERRY &amp; M. PELLENS, THE OPIUM PROBLEM
15 (1928) [hereinafter cited as TERRY &amp; PELLENS]. Marshall
was unable fully to take into account the fact that the incidence
of drug abuse in the cities was much higher than that in the
rural areas he studied; accordingly, his figures probably
underestimate the extent of addiction in the state. </p>

<p>In a similar study of Iowa in 1884, J. M. Hull found 5,732
addicts which, if representative, would reflect a national addict
population of 182,215. Hull, <i>The Opium Habit, </i>1885 IOWA

<p>In 1900 the author of a Vermont study sent 130 questionnaires
to various druggists in an attempt to determine the monthly sales
of various drugs. His 116 replies indicate that 3,300,000 doses
of opium were sold every month, or enough for every person in
Vermont over the age of 21 to receive 11/2 doses per day.

1913. Nationwide, this incidence would be 782,118. 1913

<p>72 The closing of the New York Clinic in 1919 was an
especially potent factor in promoting hysteria about heroin. More
than 7,400 addicts, about 90 percent Of whom were users of
heroin, were thrown on the streets of the city. Driven to commit
crimes, including those of narcotic violations, many of these
addicts were arrested. The increased number of arrests was widely
interpreted as an indication of moral deterioration due to
narcotics instead of evidence of maladministration of what could
have been a useful law. There were, of course, physicians who
dissented both as to the wisdom of closing the clinics and as to
the harmful effect of the drugs. Many of those who persisted in
helping their patients were arrested. Kolb, supra note 68, at 27.

police power of the States.&quot; Id. at 95. It is interesting to

regulate child labor through the taxing power was also

<p>76 justice McReynolds stated for the Court in Linder v. United

medical practice in the States is beyond the power of the Federal
Government. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress
through a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly
inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a
revenue measure. </p>

<p>The Court also held that the Harrison Act did not apply to
mere possession of opium. In reaching this conclusion the Court
pointed out that any congressional attempt to punish as a crime
possession of any article produced in a state would raise the
'gravest questions of power. United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241

<p>81 The primary objective of prohibitionary legislation was to
suppress all traffic in intoxicating beverages. Accordingly, most
states prohibited both manufacture and sale. However, New
Hampshire's law, in effect from 1855 through 1903, forbade only,
sale. </p>

<p>82 Sixteen states passed prohibitionary legislation for the
whole territory of the state. However, twelve of them had
repealed this legislation by 1903, and a thirteenth, Maine, had
repealed its statute before 1884 when prohibition was embodied in

<p>90 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856),
justice Pratt noted' &quot;That intemperance is a great evil, no
sane man can doubt.&quot; Id. at 284. The Iowa court asserted: </p>

<p>There is no statistical or economical proposition better
established, nor one to which a more general assent is given by
reading and intelligent minds, than this, that the use of
intoxicating liquors as a drink, is the cause. of more want,
pauperism, suffering, crime and public expense, than any other
cause-and perhaps it should be said, than all other causes
combined. </p>

<p>Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165, 190 (1855). </p>

<p>91 Dissenting in People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856) ,
justice Pratt stated: &quot;Spiritous liquors are necessary in
the prosecution of many of the most valuable arts,' as well as
for mechanical, manufacturing and medicinal purposes.&quot; Id.
at 260. </p>

<p>92 The Indiana Court noted &quot;as a matter of general
knowledge . . . that the use of beer &amp;c. as a beverage, is
not necessarily hurtful, any more than the use of lemonade or ice
cream.... It is the abuse, and not the use, of all these
beverages that is hurtful.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501,
519-20 (1855). </p>

<p>93 Justice Pratt reasoned: </p>

<p>Liquors, then, whether produced by fermentation or
distillation, do legally constitute property of use and value;
and the owner of this species of personal property, when lawfully
acquired, is, upon every principle, . . . entitled to the
possession and use of it. This legally includes the right of
keeping, selling or giving it away, as the owner may deem proper.
This is a natural primary right incident to ownership . . . . </p>

<p>People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244, 263 (1856); accord,
Wynehamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 396-98 (1856) (Comstock, J.). </p>

<p>94 Said the Indiana Court: </p>

<p>[T]he legislature enacted the law in question upon the
assumption that the manufacture and sale of beer . . . were
necessarily destructive to the community, and in acting upon that
assumption, in our judgment, has unwarrantably invaded the right
to private property, and its use as a beverage and article of
traffic. </p>

<p>. . . We repeat, the manufacture and sale and use of liquors
are not necessarily hurtful, and this the Court has a right to
judicially inquire into and act upon in deciding upon the
validity of the law in question-in deciding . . . whether it is
an indirect invasion of a right secured to the citizen by the
Constitution. Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 520-21 (1855) (emphasis
added). </p>

<p>95 In an opinion often cited as the first to invoke the
substantive construction of &quot;due process of law,&quot; judge
Comstock in Wynchamer v. People, 13 N.Y. 378, 392-93, 398 (1856),
stated: </p>

<p>To say that &quot;the law of the land&quot; or &quot;due
process of law&quot;, may mean the very act of legislation which
deprives the citizen of his rights, privileges or property, leads
to a simple absurdity. The Constitution would then mean, that no
person shall be deprived of his property or rights unless the
legislature shall pass a law to effectuate the wrong, and this
would be throwing the restraint entirely away. The true
interpretation of these constitutional phrases is, that where
rights are acquired by the citizen under existing law, there is
no power in any branch of the government to take them away. </p>

<p>When a law annihilates the value of property, and strips it of
its attributes, by which alone it is distinguished as property,
the owner is deprived of it according to the plainest
interpretation, and certainly within the spirit of a
constitutional provision intended expressly to shield private
rights from the exercise of arbitrary power. </p>

<p>96 The Indiana court held the prohibitionary legislation in
contravention of a provision in the state constitution declaring
that &quot;all men are endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.&quot; Beebe v. State, 6 Ind. 501, 510
(1855). Dissenting in People v. Gall2gher, 4 Mich. 244, 258
(1856), Justice Pratt conducted an identical natural rights
inquiry without the benefit of Thomas Jefferson's penmanship. </p>

<p>107 In People v. Gallagher, 4 Mich. 244 (1856), the majority
stated: </p>

<p>The legislature has said that . . . no man shall sell liquors
to be used as a beverage, because by so doing, he inflicts injury
on the public; but, says the defendant, irrespective of the evil,
this right to sell liquors is a natural right, and you have no
power to pass a law infringing that right. How does he prove it?
Not by any adjudged cases; there are none, nor by anything in the
constitution preserving to him this right; but it is to be
determined by the nature and character of the right. . . . [The
manner in which the determination is to be made is] a question
very suitable and proper for the discussion and deliberation of a
legislative body, but one which cannot be entertained by this
court. </p>

<p>Id. at 257. judge Pratt replied: </p>

<p>If the doctrine is true that the legislature can, by the
exercise of an implied discretionary power, pass any law not
expressly inhibited by the constitution, then it is certain that
a hundred laws may be enacted by that body, invading directly
legitimate business pursuits, impairing and rendering worthless
trades and occupations, and destroying the substantial value of
private property, to the amount of millions of dollars. . . . But
who, I ask, believes that the legislature possesses the power, or
that the people, in their sovereignty, ever intended to confer on
that body such unlimited omnipotence? As appears to me, no man of
reason and reflection can believe it. </p>

<p>Id. at 277-79 (dissenting opinion). </p>

<p>108 Mere possession or consumption of alcohol was not
prohibited during this phase of temperance legislation. Many of
the courts were careful to allude to this feature and to note
that forfeiture could result only from illegal
possession-possession with intent to sell in violation of the
law. See, e.g., Santo v. State, 2 Iowa 165 (1855); Commonwealth
v. Kendall, 66 Mass. (12 Cush.) 414 (1853). </p>

<p>109 123 U.S. 623 (1887). </p>

<p>110 In Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 129 (1873), the
Supreme Court held that the prohibition of traffic in
intoxicating drinks violates no privilege and immunity of United
States citizenship; the Court avoided the question whether a law
prohibiting sale of liquor owned before the law was passed was a
deprivation of property without due process. Four years later, in
Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25 (1877), the Court sustained
a prohibition law against a challenge under the obligation of
contracts clauses but still deferred consideration of the
Wynehamer question. In upholding the seizure and forfeiture of
liquors belonging to the petitioner, justice Bradley stated: If
the public safety or the public morals require the discontinuance
of any manufacture or traffic, the hand of the legislature cannot
be stayed from providing for its discontinuance, by any
incidental inconvenience which individuals or corporations may
suffer. All rights are held subject to the police power of the
State. 97 U.S. at 32. </p>

<p>Finally, in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), Wynebamer
was slain. The Court sustained a conviction for selling beer
manufactured before the passage of the law. The Court even held
that, in order to make effective its regulations against sale,
the State might forbid manufacture for personal use. Id. at 662.
The only constitutional inhibitions remaining after Mugler
emanated from the commerce power. For a discussion of the gradual
elimination of these restrictions by congressional action, see
Safely, Growth of State Power Under Federal Constitution to
Regulate Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, 3 IOWA L. BuLL. 221,
229-34 (1917). </p>

<p>111 In Mugler, justice Harlan stated: </p>

<p>There is no justification for holding that the State, under
the guise merely of police regulations, is here aiming to deprive
the citizen of his constitutional rights. . . . If, therefore, a
state deems the absolute prohibition of the manufacture and sale,
within her limits, of intoxicating liquors for other than
medical, scientific, and manufacturing purposes, to be necessary
to the peace and security of society, the courts cannot, without
usurping legislative functions, override the will of the people
as thus expressed by their chosen representatives. They have
nothing to do with the mere policy of legislation. 123 U.S. at
662. </p>

<p>119 Id. In defining property essentially in terms of habits of
the community, judge Deady was leaving room for the
&quot;natural&quot; rights argument with regard to alcohol and
tobacco: </p>

<p>True, we permit the indiscriminate use of alcohol and tobacco,
both of which are classed by science as poisons, and doubtless
destroy many lives annually. But the people of this country have
been accustomed to the manufacture and use of these for many
generations, and they are produced and possessed under the common
and long-standing impression that they are legitimate articles of
property, which the owner is entitled to dispose of without any
unusual restraint. . . . On the other hand, the use of opium,
otherwise than as this act allows, as a medicine, has but little,
if any, place in the experience or habits of the people of this
country, save among a few aliens. </p>

<p>135 Similarly, in State v. Gilman, 33 W. Va. 146, 10 S.E. 283
(1889), the court stated: </p>

<p>It can hardly be questioned that the right to possess property
is [an inalienable] right, and that that right embraces the
privilege of a citizen to keep in his possession property for
another. It is not denied that the keeping of property which is
injurious to the lives, health, or comfort of all persons may be
prohibited under the police power. . . . [I]t must, of course, be
within the range of legislative action to define the mode and
manner in which every one may so use his own as not to injure
others. But it does not follow that every statute enacted
ostensibly for the promotion of these ends is to be accepted as a
legitimate exercise of the police Power of the State . . . . </p>

<p>The keeping of liquors in his possession by a person, whether
for himself or for another, unless he does so for the illegal
sale of it, or for some other improper purpose , can by no
possibility injure or affect the health, morals, or safety of the
public; and, therefore, the statute prohibiting such keeping in
possession is not a legitimate exertion of the police power. </p>

<p>Id. at 148-49, 10 S.E. it 284 (emphasis added); accord, Ex
parte Brown, 38 Tex. Crim. 795, 42 S.W. 554 (1897). </p>

<p>In Ex parte Wilson, 6 Okla. Crim. 451, 119 P. 596 (1911), the
Court, after quoting extensively from Commonwealth v. Campbell,
noted, &quot;The only conclusion that we can legitimately arrive
at is that the act in question is not within a reasonable
exercise of the police powers of the state-is unconstitutional
and void.&quot; 6 Okla. Crim. at 475, 119 P. at 606 (emphasis
added). Finally, the Alabama Supreme Court stated, in striking
down a local ordinance prohibiting possession by beverage dealers
of alcoholic beverages: </p>

<p>[The ordinance] can be justified only, if at all, on the
ground that it sustains some reasonable relation to the
prohibition law in the way of preventing evasions of that law by
trick, artifice, or subterfuge under guise of which that 12W is
violated. But it has no such relation. It undertakes to prohibit
the keeping if) any quantity and for any purpose, however
innocent, of intoxicating liquors and beverages in places which
are innocent in themselves. Eidge v. City of Bessemer, 164 Ala.

to either the moral, mental or physical well being of one of its
citizens to such an extent that it is liable to become a burthen
upon society, it has an undoubted right to restrain the citizen
from the commission of that act; and fair and equitable

its right, but its duty, to restrain him. Id. at 164, 24 P. at

conclude that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police
power, for only then could an indirect interference with
interstate commerce be sustained. Id. at 349. The Court noted on
this point: </p>

<p>Cigarettes do not seem until recently to have attracted the
attention of the public as more injurious than other forms of
tobacco; nor are we now prepared to take judicial notice of any
special injury resulting from their use or to indorse the opinion
of the Supreme Court of Tennessee that &quot;they are inherently
bad and bad only.&quot; At the same time we should be shutting
our eyes to what is constantly passing before them were we to
affect an ignorance of the fact that a belief in their
deleterious effects, particularly upon young people, has become
very general and that communications are constantly finding their
way into the public press denouncing their use as fraught with
great danger to the youth of both sexes. Without undertaking to
affirm or deny their evil effects, we think it within the
province of the legislature to say how far they may be sold, or
to prohibit their sale entirely . . . provided . . . there be no
reason to doubt that the act in question is designed for the
protection of the public health. </p>

</p>

<p>172 In the broad language in which the ordinance is enacted it
is apparently an attempt on the part of the municipality to
regulate and control the habits and practices of the citizen
without any reasonable basis for so doing. The ordinance is an
unreasonable interference with the private rights of the citizen

<p>The ordinance is so broad as to prohibit one from smoking a
cigarette in his own home or on any private premises in the city.
To prohibit the smoking of cigarettes in [such circumstances] is
an invasion of his right to control his own personal indulgences.

ordinance applied in the home, the Kentucky court avoided the

to compel the same result, however. </p>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H. Whitebread, II</i></p>

<p><font size="5"><b>III. THE GENESIS OF MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b></font>
</p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until the inclusion of marijuana in the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act in 1932 and the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937,
there was no &quot;national&quot; public policy regarding the
drug. However, as early as 1914 the New York City Sanitary Laws
included cannabis in a prohibited drug list and in 1915 Utah
passed the first state statute prohibiting sale or possession of
the drug. By 1931 twenty-two states had enacted such legislation.
In the succeeding section, we shall delve into the circumstances
surrounding the passage of several of these early laws and the
ensuing judicial acquiescence in the legislative value judgments
concerning marijuana. We conclude that the legislative action and
approval were essentially kneejerk responses uninformed by
scientific study or public debate and colored instead by racial
bias and sensationalistic myths. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Initial State Legislation 1914-1931</b> </p>

<p>As indicated above, the Harrison Act, a regulatory measure in
the garb of a taxing statute, left many gaps unfilled in the
effort to prohibit illegal or nonmedical use of opiates and
cocaine. Although Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics stated in 1932 that few states had responded to the
Harrison Act,1 most states had in fact enacted or reenacted
narcotics laws in the period from 1914 to 1931.2 In so doing,
twenty-one states had also restricted the sale of marijuana as
part of their general narcotics articles, one state had
prohibited its use for any purpose, and four states had outlawed
its cultivation.3 Our objective in this section is to determine
why these states chose to include cannabis in their lists of
prohibited drugs. </p>

<p>The first consideration was the increasing public awareness of
the narcotics problem. As noted above, the Harrison Act
engendered a shift in public perception of the narcotics addict.
With ever-increasing frequency and venom, he was portrayed in the
public media as the criminal &quot;dope fiend.&quot; This
hysteria, coupled with the actual increases in drug-related
criminal conduct due to the closing of the clinics,4 was the
basis for a good many of the post-Harrison Act narcotic
statutes.5 Other forces such as lurid accounts in the media,6
publications of private narcotics associations 7 and the
effective separation of the addict and his problems from the
medical profession8 all pressed legislatures into action to deal
more effectively with what was perceived as a growing narcotics
problem. </p>

<p>Despite the increasing public interest in the narcotics
problem during this period, we can find no evidence of public
concern for, or understanding of, marijuana, even in those states
that banned it along with the opiates and cocaine. Observers in
the middle and late 1930's agreed that marijuana was at that time
a very new phenomenon on the national scene.9 The perplexing
question remains-why did some states include marijuana in their
prohibitive legislation a decade before it achieved any notice
whatsoever from the general public and the overwhelming majority
of legislators? </p>

<p>From a survey of contemporary newspaper and periodical
commentary we have concluded that there were three major
influences. The most prominent was racial prejudice. During this
period, marijuana legislation was generally a regional phenomenon
present in the southern and western states. Use of the drug was
primarily limited to Mexican-Americans who were immigrating in
increased numbers to those states. These movements were well
noted in the press accounts of passage of marijuana legislation.
A second factor was the assumption that marijuana, which was
presumed to be an addictive drug, would be utilized as a
substitute for narcotics and alcohol then prohibited by national
policy. This factor was particularly significant in the New York
law, the forerunner of nationwide anti-marijuana legislation.
Finally, there is some evidence that coverage of the drug by the
Geneva Conventions in 1925 was publicized in this country and may
have had some influence. </p>

<p><b>1. Rationale in the West: Class Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Geometric increases in Mexican immigration after the turn of
the century naturally resulted in the formation of sizeable
Mexican-American minorities in each western state.10 It was
thought then11 and is generally assumed now12 that use of
marijuana west of the Mississippi was limited primarily to the
Mexican segment of the population. We do not find it surprising,
therefore, that sixteen of these states prohibited sale or
possession of marijuana before 1930.13 Whether motivated by
outright prejudice or simple discriminatory disinterest, the
result was the same in each legislature-little if any public
attention, no debate, pointed references to the drug's Mexican
origins, and sometimes vociferous allusion to the criminal
conduct inevitably generated when Mexicans ate &quot;the killer
weed.&quot; </p>

<p>In Utah, for example, the nation's first statewide prohibition
of marijuana 14 in 1915 was attended by little publicity. The
combination of increasing Mexican immigration15 and the
traditional aversion of the Mormons to euphoriants of any kind16
led inevitably to the inclusion of marijuana in the state's
omnibus narcotics and pharmacy bill. Similarly, when the New
Mexico and Texas legislatures passed marijuana legislation in
1923, the former by separate statute17 and the latter by
inclusion,18 newspaper reference was minimal despite coverage in
both states of legislative action.19 The longest of the Santa Fe
New Mexican references noted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Santa Fe representative, however, had better luck with
    his bill to prevent sale of marihuana, cannabis indica,
    Indian hemp or hashish as it is variously known. This bill
    was passed without any opposition. Marihuana was brought into
    local prominence at the penitentiary board's investigation
    last summer when a convict testified he could get marihuana
    cigarets anytime he had a dollar. The drug produces
    intoxication when chewed or smoked. Marihuana is the name
    commonly used in the Southwest and Mexico.20 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In its only direct reference to marijuana, the Austin Texas
Statesman stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The McMillan Senate Bill amended the anti-narcotic law so
    as to make unlawful the possession for the purpose of sale of
    any marihuana or other drugs. Marihuana is a Mexican herb and
    is said to be sold on the Texas-Mexican border .21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discriminatory aspects of this early marijuana
legislation, suggested only obliquely by origin and apparent
disinterest in Utah, New Mexico and Texas, are directly confirmed
in Montana and Colorado. Montana newspapers gave relatively
&quot;full&quot; coverage to a proposal to exclude marijuana from
the general narcotics law and to create a separate marijuana
statute.22 On seven different days from January 14 to February
10, 1929 (the date of the bill's passage), the Montana Standard
succinctly noted the progress of the bill through the
legislature. The giveaway appeared on January 27 when the paper
recorded the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There was fun in the House Health Committee during the
    week when the Marihuana bill came up for consideration.
    Marihuana is Mexican opium, a plant used by Mexicans and
    cultivated for sale by Indians. &quot;When some beet field
    peon takes a few rares of this stuff,&quot; explained Dr.
    Fred Fulsher of Mineral County, &quot;He thinks he has just
    been elected president of Mexico so he starts out to execute
    all his political enemies. I understand that over in Butte
    where the Mexicans often go for the winter they stage
    imaginary bullfights in the 'Bower of Roses' or put on
    tournaments for the favor of 'Spanish Rose' after a couple of
    whiffs of Marijuana. The Silver Bow and Yellowstone
    delegations both deplore these international
    complications&quot; Everybody laughed and the bill was
    recommended for passage.23 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same year, a change in Colorado's marijuana law was
precipitated by less comic apprehensions of the drug's evil
effects. On April 7, 1929, a girl was murdered by her Mexican
step-father. The story was lead news in the Denver Post every day
until April 16, probably because the girl's mother was white. On
the 16th it was first mentioned that this man might have been a
marijuana user. Headlined &quot;Fiend Slayer Caught in Nebraska
[;] Mexican Confesses Torture of American Baby,&quot; and
subheaded &quot;Prisoner Admits to Officer He is Marihuana
Addict,&quot; the story, relates in full the underlying events: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;You smoke marihuana?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Yes &quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Mexican said he had been without the weed for two days
    before the killing of his step-daughter .24 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On April 17, the story on the Mexican included the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>He repeated the story he had told the Sidney Chief of
    Police regarding his addiction to marihuana saying that his
    supply of the weed had become exhausted several days before
    the killing and his nerves were unstrung.25 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to the legislative news there is no mention at any
time of a bill to regulate marijuana; however, on April 21, the
Denver Post noted the Governor had signed a bill increasing
penalties for sale, possession or production of marijuana.26 </p>

<p>The reader should note that public perception of marijuana's
ethnic origins and crime-producing tendencies often went hand in
hand, especially in the more volatile areas of the western
states. Stories such as the one appearing in the Denver Post,
where defendants charged with violent crimes attempted to blame
their actions on the effects of marijuana were primarily
responsible for the drug's characterization as a &quot;killer
weed.&quot; In any event, from this brief survey of marijuana
prohibition in the western states, we have concluded that its
Mexican use pattern was ordinarily enough to warrant its
prohibition, and that whatever attention such legislative action
received was attended by sensationalist descriptions of crimes
allegedly committed by Mexican marijuana users. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Rationale in the East: Substitution</b> </p>

<p>The first significant27 instance of marijuana regulation
appeared in the 1914 amendments to the New York City Sanitary
Laws. The inclusion by the New York legislature of marijuana in
Its general narcotics statute in 1927 was the precursor of
nationwide legislation .28 For these reasons, we have chosen New
York as the most likely source of information regarding the.
rationale for marijuana prohibition in Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont, all of which had acted
before 1931.29 </p>

<p>In January 1914 the New York legislature passed its first
comprehensive statute-The Boylan Bill-regulating the sale and use
of habit forming drugs&quot;' and did not include marijuana among
its list of prohibited narcotics. It appears that the Board of
Health of New York City then amended its Sanitary Code adding
&quot;Cannabis indica, which is the Indian hemp from which the
East Indian drug called hashish is manufactured,&quot;31 to the
City's list of prohibited drugs. Violation of this provision of
the City Sanitary Code was a misdemeanor punishable by a small
fine and/or a jail term of up to six months. On July 29, 1914, an
article reporting the amendment appeared in the New York Times
wherein the drug was described: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This narcotic has practically the same effect as morphine
    and cocaine, but it was not used in this country to any
    extent while it was easy to get the more refined narcotics.32
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day the editors of the Times commented: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[T]he inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be
    sold only on prescription is only common sense. Devotees of
    hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count, but
    they are likely to increase as other narcotics become harder
    to obtain.33 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From these observations, it would appear (1) that there were
few marijuana users at the time; and (2) that use of the drug was
expected to increase as a direct result of the restriction of
opiates and cocaine. </p>

<p>Despite New York City's early classification of cannabis with
known narcotics, New York State did not prohibit sale and
possession of the drug for other than medicinal purposes until
1927.34 And this was true despite a great deal of activity on the
narcotics front from 1914 to 1927, when the legislature acted
four different times.35 Throughout all this tumult and in the
variety of narcotics proposals suggested or enacted,36 marijuana
or cannabis was not classified among the restricted drugs until
the drafting of the 1927 Act. This act37 defined cannabis as a
&quot;habit-forming drug,&quot; 38 and accordingly punished as
misdemeanors39 the control, sale, distribution, administration
and dispensing40 of cannabis except for medical purposes. The
penalty provision of the statute did not discriminate among types
of offenses, first or subsequent violations, or the prohibited
narcotic drugs.41 </p>

<p>There is no apparent indication in the contemporary commentary
of the reasons for inclusion of marijuana in the New York laws.
When the 1927 law was passed, public concern was focused on the
general need to reduce narcotic addiction; none of the
commentators were concerned about marijuana.42 While there were
numerous articles in the media dealing with the problems of the
opiates, morphine, cocaine and heroin, only four articles about
marijuana appeared in the major New York newspaper during the
entire period from 1914 until 1927. In 1923 the New York Times
noted that the &quot;latest habit forming drug ... marihuana,
which is smoked in a cigarette&quot; was exhibited at a women's
club meeting.43 In 1925 the same paper reported that the drug had
been banned in Mexico.44 One year later, the paper reported the
results of testing in Panama on the effects of marijuana. The
article noted that as a result of these tests the study group
concluded marijuana smoking was relatively safe; thus, it was
&quot;recommended that no steps be taken by the authorities of
the Canal Zone to prevent the sale or use of marijuana and that
no special legislation on that subject was needed.&quot; 45
Finally, in July 1927, the Times reported that a Mexican family
was said to have gone insane from eating marijuana.46 Perhaps the
clearest indication of the absence of notice given the marijuana
section of the 1927 Act is that none of the articles discussing
the Act after its passage refer to marijuana .47 </p>

<p>It is likely, then, that the inclusion of cannabis in the
state law was motivated primarily by the same fear that had
provoked the Sanitary Law Amendment in 1914. Use, though still
slight, was expected to increase. Throughout the entire New York
experience the main argument was preventive: Marijuana use must
be prohibited to keep addicts from switching to it as a
substitute for the drugs which had become much more difficult to
obtain after the enactment of the Harrison Act, and for alcohol
after Prohibition.48 Accordingly, the passage of the Harrison and
Volstead Acts were direct causes of the preventive inclusion of
marijuana among prohibited drugs. In fact, it has been observed
that marijuana use did increase during this period .49 </p>

<p>Another factor that may have influenced the passage of the
1927 Act was the Second Opium Conference at Geneva in 1925,50
which included Indian hemp within the Convention against Opium
and other Dangerous Drugs, even though the United States had
withdrawn in 1925 from the League of Nations deliberations on
controlling and regulating the international traffic in dangerous
drugs.51 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. The International Scene</b> </p>

<p>The first mention of marijuana on the international front came
with the preliminary negotiations for the Hague Conference of
1912. In preparing for this Conference, which represented an
attempt to deal with the international opium traffic, the
government of Italy proposed that the production and traffic in
Indian hemp drugs be included as part of the agenda of the
Conference.52 During the Conference itself, there was no mention
of the drug, and the Convention did not include cannabis in its
provisions. In addition to the Convention, however, the delegates
signed a closing protocol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. The Conference considers it desirable to study the
    question of Indian hemp from the statistical and scientific
    point of view, with the object of regulating its abuses,
    should the necessity thereof be felt, by internal legislation
    or by an international agreement .53 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was not until just before the Geneva Conference of 1925
that the proposal was mentioned again. In 1923 the following
resolution was passed by the Advisory Committee on Traffic in
Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>IV. With reference to the proposal of the Government of
    the Union of South Africa that Indian hemp should be treated
    as one of the habit-forming drugs, the Advisory Committee
    recommends the Council that, in the first instance, the
    Governments should be invited to furnish to the League
    information as to the production and use of, and traffic in,
    this substance in their territories, together with their
    observations on the proposal of the Government of the Union
    of South Africa .54 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the 1925 meeting in Geneva, the Egyptians led the way in
proposing that hashish be included within the Convention.55 An
Egyptian delegate presented a paper on the effects and use of
hashish in Egypt. Mr. El Guindy's study is so typical of the
so-called scientific or empirical evidence that has been
presented to justify the drug's prohibition that the following
excerpt must be included. In stating that the real danger of
hashish is that it will produce insanity, the Egyptian delegate
presented the following: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The illicit use of hashish is the principal cause of most
    of the cases of insanity occurring in Egypt. In support of
    this contention, it may be observed that there are three
    times as many cases of mental alienation among men as among
    women, and it is an established fact that men are much more
    addicted to hashish than women.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Egyptian proposal was referred to a subcommittee for study
and later in the Conference this group reported that the use of
Indian hemp drugs should be limited to medical and scientific
purposes. The proceedings contain no record of what medical or
scientific evidence might have been brought forward to support
the inclusion of the Indian hemp drugs in the Convention.57
Nevertheless, they were the subject of Chapters IV and V of the
Convention.58 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>The early laws against the cannabis drugs were passed with
little public attention. Concern about marijuana was related
primarily to the fear that marijuana use would spread, even among
whites, as a substitute for the opiates and alcohol made more
difficult to obtain by federal legislation. Especially in the
western states, this concern was identifiable with the growth of
the Mexican-American minority. It is clear that no state
undertook any empirical or scientific study of the effects of the
drug. Instead they relied on lurid and often unfounded accounts
of marijuana's dangers as presented in what little newspaper
coverage the drug received. It was simply assumed that cannabis
was addictive and would have engendered the same evil effects as
opium and cocaine. Apparently, legislators in these states found
it easy and uncontroversial to prohibit use of a drug they had
never seen or used and which was associated with ethnic
minorities and the lower class. </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>B. Judicial Corroboration</b> </p>

<p>Two significant conclusions appear from a study of the few
cases59 involving convictions for marijuana offenses under the
initial wave of state laws. First, the argument regarding a
private conduct limitation on the police power had been so
discredited it was not even made. Second, the courts, like the
legislatures, relied on nonscientific materials to support the
proposition that marijuana was an addictive, mind-destroying drug
productive of crime and insanity. </p>

<p>In only one case was there a serious constitutional challenge
to the validity of the legislation. Appealing a Louisiana
conviction for possession of five hundred plants of marijuana,
the defendant in State v. Bonoa60 argued not that the state could
not punish mere possession but rather that the statute was
overbroad, since aside from its use as an intoxicant the
marijuana plant was employed in the manufacture of hemp line, in
the preparation of useful drugs and for the production of bird
seed for canaries. Defendant's contention was that only
possession, sale or use for deleterious purposes could be
prohibited. </p>

<p>The court's reply was that the drug's deleterious properties
outweighed its uses, especially since &quot; [t]he Marijuana
plant is not one of the crops of this state.&quot; 61 Defendant
also offered the reductio ad absurdum argument that if possession
of the marijuana plant may be prohibited simply because
intoxicating resin may be extracted from the flowering tops, then
the possession of corn or grapes may be prohibited because
whiskey and wine may be made from them, or possession of poppies
because opium may be extracted from them. To this the court
replied that alcohol was less injurious than marijuana and that
both alcohol and opium were difficult to prepare from these
sources while the marijuana plant was easily converted into
tobacco and cigarettes. </p>

<p>The court's reasoning is admirable if we accept the basic
premise that the marijuana drug is deleterious. To support this
conclusion the court quoted from Solis Cohen Githens'
Pharmacotheraupeutics: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first symptom is usually an exaltation of the mind . .
    . . The ideas are joyous Sleep follows . . . . When aroused
    from sleep . . . the mind passes into the same somnolent
    condition, which lasts for several hours and is followed by a
    sense of weakness and extreme mental depression. In certain
    eastern people . . . perhaps because of continued use, the
    somnolent action is replaced by complete loss of judgment and
    restraint such as is seen more often from alcohol. An Arab
    leader, fighting against the crusaders, had a bodyguard who
    partook of haschisch, and used to rush madly on their
    enemies, slaying everyone they met. The name of
    &quot;haschischin&quot; applied to them has survived as
    &quot;assassin.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The habitual use of cannabis does not lead to much
    tolerance, nor do abstinence symptoms follow its withdrawal.
    It causes, however, a loss of mentality, resembling dementia,
    which can be recognized even in dogs.62 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The court also quotes Rusby, Bliss &amp; Ballard, The
Properties and Uses of Drugs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The particular narcosis of cannabis consists in the
    liberation of the imagination from all restraint . . . . Not
    rarely, in [the depression] state, an irresistible impulse to
    the commission of criminal acts will be experienced.
    Occasionally an entire group of men under the influence of
    this drug will rush out to engage in violent or bloody
    deeds.63 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On these two sources, the entire opinion stands. The allegedly
deleterious consequences-criminal activity and insanity-are
supported only by the mythical etymology of the word
&quot;assassin.&quot; The marijuana user's purported propensity
toward crime, based on similar and often weaker authority, was
the primary rationale underlying passage of the Marihuana Tax
Act.64 So preposterous is this assertion that even the proponents
of criminalization-including the Cormmissioner of the Bureau of
Narcotics-later implicitly rejected it.65 </p>

<p>In any event, the courts were as willing to accept such
evidence as the legislatures. In a Utah case, State v. Navaro,66
where the court cited the acknowledged evils of marijuana to
repel a vagueness attack,67 it relied on another set of dubious
authorities. First, the court referred to the case of State v.
Diaz68 wherein a defendant in a first degree murder prosecution
tried to disprove the requisite mens rea by showing that he was
under the influence of marijuana at the time of the offense. Diaz
had claimed that &quot;his mind was an entire blank as to all
that happened to him and stated that after smoking the marijuana
he became 'very crazy.' To corroborate his assertion, defendant
summoned a physician whose testimony was summarized in Diaz in a
passage quoted in full in Navaro: </p>

<p>He stated that [marijuana] is a narcotic and acts upon the
central nervous system affecting the brain, producing
exhilarating effects and causing one to do things which he
otherwise would not do and especially induces acts of violence;
that violence is one of the symptoms of an excessive use of
marijuana. That the marihuana produces an &quot;I don't
care&quot; effect. A man having used liquor and marihuana might
deliberately plan a robbery and killing and carry it out and
escape, and then later fail to remember anything that had
occurred. 70 </p>

<p>Thus an attempt in an adversary setting by an accused to
escape criminal responsibility by blaming his offense on
marijuana intoxication became medical authority for the
scientific hypothesis that marijuana use causes crime. </p>

<p>The second source of support in Navaro for the allegedly
deleterious effects of marijuana was a 1932 article by Hayes and
Bowery (the latter a member of the Wichita, Kansas, Police
Department) entitled Marihuana .71 Calling for stricter penalties
for marijuana use, the authors stated that during the
exhilaration phase, the user is likely to have increased sexual
desires72 and to commit &quot;actions of uncontrollable violence,
or even murder.&quot; 73 For these propositions, they cited
newspaper accounts of crimes the causes of which the reporter
attributed to marijuana74 and police testimony to the same
effect.75 For example, the Chief Detective of the Los Angeles
Police Department was quoted as saying: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the past we have had officers of this department shot
    and killed by Marihuana addicts and <i>have traced the act of
    murder directly to the influence of Marihuana, with no other
    motive</i>. Numerous assaults have been made upon officers
    and citizens with intent to kill by Marihuana addicts which
    were directly traceable to the influence of Marihuana.76 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be noted that Hayes and Bowery attributed the
violent impulse to the absence of restraint engendered during the
so-called exhilaration phase, while each of the authorities cited
by the Louisiana court in Bonoa attributed the same impulse to
the sufferings experienced during the &quot;depression&quot;
phase.77 </p>

<p>The authors also asserted that habitual use leads to a
&quot;loss of mental activity, accompanied by a general dullness
and indolence, like that of chronic alcoholics or opium
caters,&quot; to &quot;destruction of brain tissues&quot; and
inevitably to insanity. For this proposition, the authors merely
said that &quot;seventeen to twenty per cent of all males
admitted to mental hospitals and asylums in India have become
insane through the use of this drug.&quot;78 </p>

<p>Finally the court cited an article by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, entitled Marihuana as a
Developer of Crimiinals.79 The title conveys the message. We will
return to Mr. Stanley in the succeeding section.80 </p>

<p>The nonchalance with which Utah and Louisiana courts cited
sensationalistic, nonscientific sources to support the
proposition that marijuana produced crime and insanity suggests
how widely accepted this hypothesis was among decision-makers,
both judicial and legislative, prior to 1931. Given the
prevalence of this attitude, the noninvolvement of the middle
class, and the precedent established in the earlier alcohol and
narcotics cases, it is not surprising that constitutional
challenges were either not made or easily rebuffed. Nor is it
surprising that challenges regarding the ambiguity of the word
&quot;marijuana&quot; were unsuccessful.81 The courts, like the
legislatures, assumed marijuana caused crime and insanity, and
assumed that had public opinion crystallized on the question, it
would have favored the suppression of a drug with such evil
effects.<br>

drugs. Ch. 66,  7, 8, [1915] Utah Laws 77. The law forbade
sale and possession of the named drugs, and provided for medical
use under a system of prescriptions and order blanks.
Interestingly, clinical treatment of addicts was allowed. Id. at

offenders faced prison terms from one to five years. The statute
made no distinction between sale and possession, nor among the

<p>19 The Santa Fe New Mexican, hometown paper of the bill's
sponsor, made only one mention of marijuana at the time of
passage, and that was to note that the drug was being smuggled
into the state prisons. Santa Fe New Mexican, Feb. 1, 1923. </p>

<p>The Austin Texas Statesman gave heavy coverage to legislative
news at this time because the legislature was in special session
called by the Governor to deal with a budgetary problem. </p>

<p>20 Santa Fe New Mexican, Jan. 31, 1923. The statute was passed
on February 27, 1923; during the period from January 20 to
February 28, there were only three other references to marijuana.
The newspaper first noted the bill in a one sentence report that
a ban on sale of marijuana was to be discussed. Id., Jan. 20,
1923. Finally, in articles entitled &quot;A Day In The
Legislature,&quot; the progress of the bill (H.B. 56) was noted
on February 21 and 27 in simple lists of bills enacted. Id., Feb.
21, 27, 1923. So inconsequential was the bill that it was not
even mentioned in two stories describing the activities of the
legislature for that session. Id., Feb. 27, 1923, at 1, col. 1. </p>

<p>21 Austin Texas Statesman, June 19, 1923. Despite heavy
coverage of legislative news and of narcotics generally, the El
Paso Times made no reference to marijuana between June 10 and
June 25. The Texas Statesman mentioned the &quot;McMillan
Bill&quot; only two other times, each time without direct
reference to marijuana. </p>

<p>22 Unlike most states that passed laws early in the 1920's
against marijuana use, Montana in 1927 passed a statute which

Rev. Code of Mont. ch. 227, S 3186 (1921), to include marijuana.
Ch. 91,  1, [ 1927] Mont. Laws 324. The new law, ch. 6, [1929]
Mont. Laws 5, made use, sale or possession without a prescription
a misdemeanor. </p>

penalized possession, sale, gift, or cultivation of any of the
cannabis drugs as a misdemeanor. Offenses carried a fine and/or
imprisonment in the county jail for not less than one or more
than six months. The new law, ch. 93, [1929] Colo. Laws 331,
increased the penalties for second offenders to one to five year
terms in the penitentiary. </p>

<p>27 Although Commissioner Anslinger stated in the 1937 Tax Act
Hearings that the District of Columbia had no law regulating
marijuana, Dr. Woodward of the AMA refuted the Commissioner's
statement by citing a 1906 provision which limited the sale of
cannabis to pharmacists and regulated sale of the drug by such
pharmacists to the public. Tax Act Hearings 92-93. The D.C.
provision, Act of May 7, 1906, ch. 2084,  13, 34 Star. 175, is
typical of early attempts to deal with the drug under the general
poison laws, but it is noteworthy in its treatment of marijuana
separately from opiates. </p>

<p>28 See pp. 10 30-3 3 infra. </p>

<p>29 In 1913, Maine prohibited the sale of cannabis indica
without a prescription. STATE LAWS 137. Massachusetts passed a
similar law in 1917, id. at 150, and Michigan forbade possession
in 1929, id. at 161. A 1923 Ohio law prohibited sale or
possession with intent to sell, id. at 242; Rhode Island

legislation in New York was enacted in 1893. Ch. 661, art. XII,

prescription containing opium, morphine, cocaine or chloral could
be filled more than once. Two years later, the legislature
enacted a provision requiring that the effect of narcotics on the
human system be taught in the public schools. Ch. 1041, 1,
[18951 N.Y. Laws 972. In 1897, a law was passed making it a
felony to possess any narcotic &quot;with intent to administer
the same or cause the same to be administered to another&quot;
without his consent. Ch. 42,  1, [1897] N.Y. Laws 21. The first
provision aimed at the sale of narcotics was passed in 1907 and
provided that the sale or distribution of cocaine without a
prescription was unlawful. Ch. 424, @ 1, [ 1907] N.Y. Laws 879.

all the legislation relating to the narcotics problem. Ch. 708,
[1921] N.Y. Laws 2496. The measure made no provision for other
laws on the subject. This surprising move was made in the
interests of economy, N.Y. Times, Jan. 6, 1921, at 1, col. 8, and
with the belief that the drug problem could be better handled by
local authorities working in concert with federal agencies. See

<p>36 As late as 1918, a legislative committee that had
exhaustively studied the narcotics problem in New York did not
mention the use of marijuana and concluded: &quot;The drugs which
are the sources of the difficulty are cocaine and eucaine with
their salts and derivatives and opium and its derivatives,
codeine, morphine and heroin.&quot; JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMM. TO

provisions relating to the control and use of narcotic drugs and
treatment of addicts; it also exempted certain preparations from
its coverage. The act furnished the model for the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act. See pp. 1030-31 infra. </p>

<p>Subsequently, in 1929, unlawful sale of narcotics was made a

eight cases dealing with marijuana under laws enacted prior to
the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. In chronological order: Gonzales

<p>67 Appellant, convicted on an information charging
&quot;possession of marijuana,&quot; contended that the statue
prohibited only possession of the flowering tops and leaves of
the marijuana plant. The court held that marijuana was the
popular name for the drug, not just the plant, and that the
information accordingly charged an offense. For this proposition,
it cited dictionaries, other state statutes, articles, cases and
texts. It is the court's familiarity with the articles describing
the allegedly evil effects of the drug with which we are
concerned. </p>

The Texas court was somewhat stricter in a series of cases
charging simply sale or possession of &quot;narcotic drugs&quot;
without specifying marijuana. On the same day, the court reversed
convictions in Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 209. 58 S.W.2d 534
(1933) (possession); Baker v. State, 123 Tex. Crim. 212, 58

Tex. Crim. 237, 58 S.W.2d 833, (1933) (possession). On the other
hand the Court held that an indictment charging &quot;possession
of marijuana&quot; is sufficient even though it does not allege
that marijuana is a narcotic drug. Santos v. State 122 Tex. Crim.
69, 53 S.W.2d 609 (1932).<br>

<p><b>IV. PASSAGE OF THE UNIFORM NARCOTIC DRUG ACT: </b></p>

<p><b>1927-1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Our conclusions to this point bear summarization. During the
first two decades of the twentieth century, state as well as
national policy was steadfastly opposed to manufacture, sale and
consumption of narcotics and alcohol except for medical purposes.
Constitutional objections ions were uniformly ignored, in the
narcotics cases primarily because the nexus between the private
conduct and public harm was in fact a close one, and in the
alcohol cases primarily because the legislation was in response
to full operation of the public opinion process, to which the
courts were willing to defer. </p>

<p>We have also found that public opinion had not crystallized
against intoxicants generally, although public policy was moving
rapidly in that direction. Ultimately, the mere existence of that
public policy even in the form of criminal law-was not sufficient
to convert a public antipathy toward the evils of commercial
alcohol traffic into opposition to moderate use of alcohol. On
the question of private use, the public policy was unenforceable
and eventually abandoned. However, with respect to narcotics, the
public policy, also expressed through the criminal law,
effectively converted narcotics use, in the public view, from a
medical problem to a legal-moral problem. Sympathy for
unfortunate victims turned into moral indictment. Because other
laws and medical advances had reduced the number of accidental
addicts, the number of addicts decreased; in this sense the
public policy was successful. However, to the extent that this
police, effectively ostracized a group of users from the rest of
society, drove them to criminal activity to sustain their habit,
and engendered a moralistic public image, the stage was set for
many ensuing problems the consequences of which have only
recently become matters of public debate. </p>

<p>Ancillary to these developments during this period was the
classification of marijuana in some half the states as an
addictive drug that produced the same evils as the opiates and
cocaine--crime, pauperism and insanity. The users, few in number,
were primarily Mexicans. But as Mexican immigration increased and
the legitimate supply of narcotics and alcohol disappeared, a
fear developed, particularly in the western states, that
marijuana use would increase, particularly among the white youth.
As a result, some twenty-two states restricted marijuana use to
medical channels. The private conduct objection having
evaporated, the courts uncritically affirmed the legislative
classification, accepting on faith nonscientific opinion that
marijuana was a &quot;killer weed.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though the public opinion process did not operate on the
issue during this period, the decision-makers in all probability
thought that their actions comported with latent public
attitudes. If indeed marijuana caused crime and insanity, of
course the public would oppose its use, as it presumably did use
of opium and cocaine. Because the users were few in number and
confined primarily to a suppressed social and economic minority,
there was no voice which could be beard to challenge these
assumptions. To put it another way, the middle class had
successfully frustrated alcohol prohibition because the public
opinion process came to reflect its view that the law should not
condemn intoxication. Yet because marijuana use was primarily a
lower class phenomenon, the middle class was generally unaware of
the proposed legislation. </p>

<p>The public opinion process did not operate and decision-makers
remained uninformed about the drug. Quickly and with neither
consideration nor dissent, the laws were enacted, thus
establishing a deliberative format followed often in the
succeeding debates. </p>

<p>Although the groundwork had been laid, denigration of the
&quot;loco-weed&quot; was primarily a regional phenomenon until
1932. Nationalization ensued in two fell swoops in the 1930's.
First, cannabis was included in an optional provision of the
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act proposed in 1932. Second, Congress
enacted the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. In the following sections
we shall scrutinize these two watershed developments. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. Origins of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>As we have suggested, the Harrison Act's masquerade as a
revenue measure required residual state legislation in order to
effectuate full prohibition of the narcotics trade in America.1
After its passage most states obediently marched to the tune
played in Washington. By 1931 every state had restricted the sale
of cocaine and, with the exception of two, the opiates.2
Thirty-six states had enacted legislation prohibiting
unauthorized possession of cocaine3 and thirty-five prohibited
unauthorized possession of the opiates and other restricted
drugs.4 Eight states also prohibited possession of hypodermic
syringes.5 Perhaps the most significant feature of the state
response to the Harrison Act was the sharp increase in penalties
between 1914 and 1931.6 Even those penalties, however, seem light
in comparison with the current penalties.7 </p>

<p>On the other hand, some influential legislators thought that
the Federal Act was sufficient to deal with the problem.8 And
there was a considerable lack of uniformity regarding the
offenses prohibited and the penalties imposed by the several
states. Finally, there was little attention devoted to
development of enforcement patterns within and among the states.9
</p>

<p>With such a variety of state legislation, it is not surprising
that little data is available on the enforcement of these laws.
Since the Uniform Crime Statistics, currently the most reliable
source for enforcement data, were first compiled in 1932, there
are no figures on the number of drug arrests by state authorities
in the 1920's. One commentator asserts: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>As of June 30, 1928, of the 7738 prisoners in federal
    penitentiaries, 2529 were sentenced for narcotics offenses,
    1156 for prohibition law violations, and 1148 for
    stolen-vehicle transactions. Data are not available for
    approximately the same number in state institutions at this
    time.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the significant degree of federal enforcement activity
evidenced by the above data, state law enforcement agencies
seldom involved themselves with narcotics.11 Perhaps the best
evidence of the lax enforcement of state narcotic laws from 1914
to 1927 is the 1921 call for more effective enforcement of the
1917 Massachusetts anti-narcotic law by the Medical Director of
the Boston Municipal Court: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our laws aiming at the suppression of morphinism could
    perhaps be better, but, no matter whether they be improved or
    not, they will not have their maximal efficiency without
    adequate appropriations for their enforcement. Even with the
    insufficient funds now available, more could be reached. I
    understand, for instance, that there is no special police
    force (white squads) entrusted with the detection and arrest
    of cases of V.D.L. [Violation of the Drug Law.] and that
    officers are very much hankered by not being allowed to
    follow suspected persons outside their particular
    districts.12 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general lack of uniformity in anti-narcotic legislation,13
the weakness of state enforcement procedures, 14 and the growing
hysteria about dope fiends and criminality15 converged in several
requests beginning as early as 1927 for a uniform state narcotic
law.16 </p>

<p>The drafting process of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act must
also be viewed against the backdrop of two larger movements: </p>

<p>(1) the trend toward the creation and dissemination of uniform
state laws by the National Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, a
group to which each state sent two representatives appointed by
the governor; and </p>

<p>(2) the general concern in the late 20's and early 30's about
controlling interstate crime, manifested, for example, in the
creation of the nearly autonomous Federal Bureau of Investigation
in 1930. </p>

<p>Because the concepts of states rights and narrowly construed
federal power held shelf sway in this period, appeal to the
National Commissioners was the inevitable recourse for those
pressing for uniform and-narcotic regulations. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Drafting the Law</b> </p>

<p>A committee of Commissioners in conjunction with Dr. William
C. Woodward, Executive Secretary of the Bureau of Legal Medicine
and Legislation of the American Medical Association, prepared and
submitted at the 1925 meeting of the Commissioners the First
Tentative Draft.17 The Committee report stated: &quot;It occurs
to your committee that the New York Act should be taken as a
basis for framing a Uniform Act, and the draft submitted herewith
is largely a copy of the New York Act.&quot; 18 It appears that
the First Draft was drawn up by the Chairman of the Committee
alone.19 It was never presented on the floor of the full meeting
but was recommitted for further study. 20 The First Draft
included the following definitions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(12) &quot;Cannabis indica&quot; or &quot;cannabis
    sativa&quot; shall include any compound, manufacture, salt,
    derivative or preparation thereof and any synthetic
    substitute for any of them identical in chemical composition.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>(13) &quot;Habit forming drugs&quot; shall mean coca
    leaves, opium, cannabis indica or cannabis sativa.21 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere in the Committee report or in the Proceedings does
there appear an explanation of the inclusion of cannabis under
the prohibited or regulated drugs. </p>

<p>The Second Tentative Draft was presented in 1928,22 and again
the draft was not discussed at the Conference but recommitted for
further study.23 The Second Draft was an exact copy of the 1927
New York statute.24 It retained cannabis in the class of
&quot;habit forming drugs .&quot; 25 The lack of concern on the
part of the Commissioners themselves for the whole narcotics
matter is reflected in the remarks of the President of the
Conference in introducing a brief statement to the Conference by
Dr. Woodward: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>President Miller: In view of the importance of the act I
    think it would not be amiss to listen to the Doctor for a few
    minutes, that he may point out to us why it is important. In
    some of the states we do not recognize the importance because
    it has not been called to our attention.26 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the statements of Dr. Woodward point out that one of
the major forces supporting the drafting of the Uniform Act was
the AMA. The doctors not only wanted to protect the public from
drug addiction but also sought uniformity among state laws
&quot;in order that the profession may have a better
understanding of its obligations and duties and of its rights in
the use of narcotic drugs. &quot; 27 </p>

<p>Two Third Drafts were submitted. The initial one closely
resembled the first two Tentative Drafts and was presented in
1929.28 Again, it was recommitted for further study.29 The second
Third Tentative Draft30 was the first to remove cannabis from the
definition of &quot;habit forming drugs&quot; and to include only
a supplemental provision for dealing with the drug.31 The
explanation for this change from the first two drafts is
contained in this note following the supplemental section: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note: Because of the many objections raised to the
    inclusion of cannabis indica, cannabis americana and cannabis
    sativa in the general list of habit-forming drugs, no mention
    is made of them in other sections of this act. The foregoing
    section is presented in order to meet an apparent demand for
    some method of preventing the use of such drugs for the
    production and maintenance of undesirable drug addiction. It
    may be adopted or rejected, as each state sees fit, without
    affecting the rest of the act.32 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judge Deering, the Chairman of the Committee on the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act, recommended recommission for further study
because the committee had not yet had a chance to consult with
the newly created Bureau of Narcotics. At the time of this
conference (August 14, 1930) no one had yet been appointed to
fill the office of Commissioner of the Bureau.33 </p>

<p>After receiving suggestions from the newly appointed
Commissioner Anslinger, the Committee presented a Fourth
Tentative Draft to the national conference in September 1931.34
The section dealing with marijuana was identical to that included
in the 1930 revised version of the Third Tentative Draft.35 The
national conference directed the Committee to return the next
year with a Fifth Tentative or Final Draft:36 </p>

<p>The Fifth-and final-Tentative Draft was adopted by the
National Conference of Commissioners on October 8, 1932.37 There
were some major changes in the Uniform Act between the Fourth and
the Fifth Tentative Drafts with regard to the regulation of
marijuana. Although the marijuana provisions remained
supplemental to the main body of the Act, any state wishing to
regulate sale and possession of marijuana was instructed to
simply add cannabis to the definition of &quot;narcotic
drugs,&quot; in which case all the other provisions of the Act
would apply to marijuana as well as the opiates and cocaine.38 It
appears that the change from a supplemental section to a series
of amendments to the relevant sections of the Act was preferred
by the Narcotics Bureau.39 The only opposition to adoption of the
Final Draft came from some Commissioners who objected to tying
the uniform state law to the terms of the Federal Harrison Act.40
This last obstacle to adoption of the Act was overcome by the
argument that a number of states had already passed such
legislation so that the federalism problem should not stand in
the way; the Act was adopted 26-3.41 These floor arguments at the
national conference are a most important indication that no one
challenged or even brought up the issue of the designations of
the drugs to be prohibited. Moreover, this brief debate confirms
the notion that the Act received very little attention of any of
the Commissioners other than those sitting on the committee that
drafted it.42 </p>

<p>Examination of the annual proceedings of the Commissioners
immediately suggests several conclusions about the drafting and
proposal of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. (1) It was drafted in
conjunction with the American Medical Association and, after
1930, Commissioner Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
(2) It was not one of the more controversial uniform laws and it
was given little consideration during the full meetings of the
Commissioners. (3) Impetus for the legislation, especially the
optional marijuana provisions, came from the Bureau of Narcotics
itself. (4) No scientific study of any kind was undertaken before
the optional marijuana section was proposed. (5)The first three
tentative drafts included marijuana within the general part of
the Act while the last two (including the one finally adopted by
the Commissioners) made marijuana the subject of a separate,
optional provision. (6) The model for all the drafts of the
Uniform Act was the 1927 New York State statute. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. Passage of the State Laws</b> </p>

<p>By 1937 every state had enacted some form of legislation
relating to marijuana, and thirty-five had enacted the Uniform
Act.43 The process by which a previously regional phenomenon
became nationwide closely parallels that which characterized the
earlier state-by-state developments. The major difference is that
the Bureau of Narcotics sought to insure passage of the Act in
each state through lobbying and testifying before the
legislatures and by propagandizing in channels of public opinion.
The Bureau's role has been overstated, however. The same factors
that combined to produce the earlier legislation were exacerbated
during the nationalization period, 1932-1937, and the legislation
probably would have passed just as easily without the efforts of
the Bureau. </p>

<p>Use of the drug was still slight and confined to
underprivileged or fringe groups who had no access either to
public opinion or to the legislators. The middle class had little
knowledge and even less interest in the drug and the legislation.
Passage of the Act in each state was attended by little
publicity, no scientific study and even more blatant ethnic
aspersions than the earlier laws. In short, the laws went
unnoticed by legal commentators, the press and the public at
large, despite the propagandizing efforts of the Bureau of
Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. Use Patterns and Public Knowledge: 1931-1937</b> </p>

<p>As we noted earlier, marijuana use began in this country in
states near the Mexican border,44 &quot;marijuana&quot; in fact
being a Mexican label for the cannabis drug. Throughout the
1920's marijuana use was confined primarily to the
Mexican-American community; however, by the late 20's use of this
drug had spread to many of the larger cities and had become quite
popular among some elements in the Black ghettoes .45 jazz
musicians, dancers and others found the drug a cheap and readily
available euphoriant.46 </p>

<p>Nevertheless, use still remained slight even in 1934.
Commissioner Anslinger himself asserted in 1937: &quot;Ten years
ago we only heard about it [marijuana] throughout the Southwest .
. . . [I]t has only become a national menace in the last 3
years.&quot; 47 Still another commentator has written: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Only in the 1920's was there any significant usage even by
    the Mexican-American communities in border cities, and only
    in the mid and late 1920's did Negro, jazz musicians and
    &quot;degenerate&quot; bohemian sub-cultures start smoking
    marijuana. Even the most lurid Journalists did not claim
    marijuana &quot;seeped&quot; into society at large until the
    1930's and usually the mid-30's.48 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As late as 1928, the arrest of one Harlem youth for possession
of a small amount of marijuana was news.&quot; Thus, we conclude
that the number of users was still small, although it may have
begun to grow around 1935, and that these users were still
concentrated regionally in the West and Southwest and
socioeconomically within the lower class Mexican-American and
Black communities. </p>

<p>At the same time, the overwhelming majority of middle-class
Americans in the 1930's knew nothing of marijuana use-they had
never seen marijuana and knew no one who used the drug. Prior to
1935 there was little, if any, attention given marijuana in major
national magazines50 and the leading national newspapers.51 That
few middle class Americans in this period knew anything of
marijuana or its effects is best illustrated by the fact that the
Bureau of Narcotics conducted a campaign to alert people to the
dangers of marijuana. The Bureau as early as 1932 began arousing
public opinion against marijuana by &quot;an educational campaign
describing the drug, its identification and its evil
effects.&quot; 52 In July 1936, the New York City police were
shown marijuana so that they would recognize it growing or in
dried, smokeable form .53 Thus, even policemen had to be shown
the plant as late as 1936 to permit effective enforcement of the
New York state law. We may accordingly infer that the level of
public familiarity with the drug was quite low indeed.54 </p>

<p>What little information filtered to the middle class was
generated by sporadic campaigns by local newspapers detailing the
potential evils of marijuana; the accounts, as before, were
sensationalistic and tended to exacerbate latent ethnic
prejudices. For example, a 1934 newspaper account linked crime in
the Southwest with marijuana smoking Mexican-Americans in the
region.55 In a 1935 letter to the editor of the New York Times, a
Sacramento, California, reader asserted: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana, perhaps now the most iinsidious of our
    narcotics, is a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican
    immigration . . . . Mexican peddlers have been caught
    distributing sample marijuana cigarettes to school
    children.56 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer went on to demand a quota on Mexicans permitted to
enter the country. In testifying in favor of the Marihuana Tax
Act, Commissioner Anslinger submitted a letter he had received
from the editor of a Colorado newspaper asking the Bureau to help
stamp out the marijuana menace. After describing an attack by a
Mexican-American, allegedly under the influence of marijuana, on
a girl of his region the writer stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I wish I could show you what a small marijuana cigaret can
    do to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents.
    That's why our problem is so great; the greatest percentage
    of our population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons,
    most of whom are low mentally, because of social and racial
    conditions.57 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, in the testimony at the hearings on the Marihuana Tax
Act the following is excerpted from an article included in the
record: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We find then that Colorado reports that the Mexican
    population there cultivates on an average of 2 to 3 tons of
    the weed annually. This the Mexicans make Into cigarettes,
    which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white school
    students.58 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, not only did few middle-class Americans know about
marijuana and its use, but also what little
&quot;information&quot; was available provoked an automatic
adverse association of the drug with Mexican immigration, crime
and the deviant life style in the Black ghettos. Naturally, the
impending drug legislation, as had the earlier state legislation,
became entangled with society's views of these minority groups. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Role of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</b> </p>

<p>It has become quite fashionable among critics of existing
marijuana legislation to assert that the sole cause of the
illegal status of marijuana has been the crusading zeal of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and especially of its long-time head,
Harry J. Anslinger. Some observers have suggested that the
Bureau's activity was produced by bureaucratic exigencies and the
need to expand;59 others have said the Bureau was on a moral
crusade;60 still others have asserted that the Bureau believed
its own propaganda about the link between criminality and dope
fiends.61 While much of this may be true, it is clear that the
Bureau did not single-handedly conjure up the idea of banning
marijuana use. Since many states had already undertaken the
regulation of marijuana before the creation of the Bureau in
1930, we cannot credit the Bureau alone with the pressure to
outlaw the drug. </p>

<p>At the same time, it is certain that the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics' actions quickened the pace of the passage by state
legislators of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. The Bureau saw the
passage of state narcotics laws as one of its primary objectives.
To this end we have detailed how directly the Bureau was involved
in the creation of the Final Draft of the Uniform Act. After
approval of the Final Draft, the Bureau began a significant
campaign in the newspapers and legal journals to boost public
support for the Uniform Act.62 By detailing the inability of
federal enforcement agencies to deal with the burgeoning
narcotics traffic, the Bureau continued to press for passage of
the Uniform Act by creating a felt need in the public for such
legislation.63 Despite the efforts of the Bureau, the Uniform Act
went virtually unnoticed by legal commentators and periodicals,
and by the public media. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Legislative Scrutiny and Media Coverage</b> </p>

<p>The Uniform Act was passed by the legislatures of most states
with out scientific study or debate and without attracting public
attention. </p>

<p>In examining in detail the passage of the Uniform Act in
Virginia and some other selected states, it will be clear that
public concern over marijuana succeeded the outlawing of the drug
and did not precede it. Our methodology to determine the extent
of public attention in a given state at the time of the passage
of the act was to review the newspapers of larger cities for the
two weeks before and after passage.64 </p>

<p>In Virginia the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act passed the House
88-0 on February 16, 1934,65 and was approved 34-0 by the Senate
on February 22.66 Although the Act as passed in Virginia
contained no marijuana provisions, the same legislature the next
month passed a bill (H.B. 236), prohibiting &quot;use of opium,
marijuana [and] loco weed ... in the manufacture of cigarettes,
cigars&quot; and other tobacco products.67 This law, which
amended a 1910 Virginia statute prohibiting the use of opium in
the manufacture of cigarettes,68 was the first mention of
marijuana, or any of its derivatives in the Virginia Code. </p>

<p>An examination of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the newspaper
of the state capital and perhaps the most influential newspaper
in the state at that time, for the period surrounding the
enactment of these two provisions (February 1 to March 15, 1934)
shows clearly that little, if any, public attention attended
their passage. There is no mention at any time of H.B. 236.69 As
for H.B. 94 (the Uniform Act), the Times Dispatch reported on
February 7 that the bill had been introduced. This announcement
was buried among the list of all bills introduced and referred on
February 6.70 In a February 12 article dealing with
&quot;controversial&quot; bills before the House and Senate that
week no mention was made of H.B. 94. On March 6, the newspaper
recorded: &quot;Among the important bills passed were. . . . [far
down the list] the Scott bill, making the State narcotic law
conform to the Federal statute.&quot; 71 That is the sum of the
publicity received by the Uniform Act and the statute that first
regulated marijuana in any way in Virginia. </p>

<p>In 1936, the legislature passed a separate statute prohibiting
the sale and use of marijuana. This bill-S.B. 289-passed the
House and Senate unanimously.72 The Act prohibited, except for a
narrow medical exception, sale, possession, use and cultivation
of marijuana .73 The penalties for violation, interestingly, were
more severe than those for violation of the 1934 Uniform Act.
Looking again at the Times-Dispatch for the period from February
15 to March 19, 1936, we find only one brief article on the new
marijuana legislation. After the Senate passed the measure on
February 29, the following appeared: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Among the bills passed by the Senate was the Apperson
    measure prohibiting the cultivation, sale or distribution of
    derivatives of the plant cannabis sativa, introduced as an
    outgrowth of alleged traffic in marihuana cigarettes in
    Roanoke. It fixes punishment for violation of its provisions
    at from one to 10 years in the penitentiary, or by
    confinement in jail for 12 months and a fine of not more than
    $1,000 or both. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Charges that school children were being induced to become
    addicts of marihuana cigarettes and that the weed was being
    cultivated in and near the city on a wide scale were laid
    before the Roanoke City Council last year. A youth who said
    he was a former addict of the drug testified before the
    Council that inhalation of one of the cigarettes would
    produce a 'cheap drunk' of several days' duration.74 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No further mention of this statute was made after the House
passed it or after the Governor signed it into law. </p>

<p>In order to determine whether the lack of public attention in
Virginia was common to other states when the first prohibition of
marijuana took place, we have surveyed the leading newspapers of
several other states at the times encompassing passage of the
law. We tried to select states that had not previously regulated
use of the drug under the assumption that more publicity would
attend initial legislation than an amendment of existing law. </p>

<p>In New Jersey, Rhode Island, Oregon and West Virginia, for
example, the major newspapers of Newark, Providence, Salem and
Charleston 78 respectively, referred to the Uniform Act only once
and to marijuana not at all. In Kentucky, the Louisville Herald
Post printed only two short references to the Uniform Act,79 one
of which referred to marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[Congressman] Kramer added that boys and girls of school
    age are being led into the use of habit forming drugs by
    underworld leaders.......... Muggles&quot; or cigarettes made
    from marijuana, commonly called loco weed or hemp, are also
    tabooed under the new state law, it was learned.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typical of both legislative and newspaper concern about the
new law is the following Charleston Daily Mail comment: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Narcotic Bill </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inconspicuously upon the special calendar of the house of
    delegates rather far down upon it-is Engrossed S.B. No. 230,
    lodging specific powers in the hands of state authorities for
    the control of the traffic in narcotics. It has passed the
    Senate unanimously. It should pass the House, and its only
    danger of defeat there is the very real one that it will
    become lost in the shuffle of adjournment now but a few hours
    away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The bill goes under the name of the uniform narcotic drug
    act and it is just that. Identical measures for the control
    by the states of illicit traffic on drugs have been passed by
    other states, notably the Southern group. Its passage here
    would result in a broad territory in which there are
    corresponding laws .... 81 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The editorial nowhere mentions marijuana. The bill itself
passed in the waning hours of the special session with no
subsequent attention given it. 82 </p>

<p>From our survey of these and other states, we have concluded
that with but one exception83 the Virginia experience was the
norm. (1) The laws prohibiting use, sale, possession, and
distribution of marijuana passed unnoticed by the media. There
was no public outcry for such legislation. (2) Quite often the
bill was buried beneath more controversial bills in a busy
legislative session. (3) In many states the Act was passed late
in the session along with myriad other
&quot;uncontroversial&quot; laws. (4) Finally, no state undertook
independent study to determine the medical facts about
marijuana-they relied on information supplied by the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics84 or a few lurid newspaper stories.85 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Available Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>In conjunction with the fourth conclusion from our state case
histories of the passage of this Act, we should examine the
extent of medical knowledge that might have been available to
legislators had they wanted to conduct an independent evaluation
of the dangers of the hemp drugs. </p>

<p>There were five influential sources for information about the
effects of marijuana and hemp on humans. None of these were
conducted with the scientific precision characterizing modern
studies of drug effects. However, they each deserve mention here
either because they deserved attention then or because they
heavily influenced later commentators. </p>

<p>The first exhaustive study of the effects of cannabis and the
other hemp drugs was done by the British in India. Their Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission studied cannabis use among the native
population in India in 1893 and 1894,86 and submitted its
conclusions in a 500-page report. The Commission received
evidence from 1,193 witnesses, including 335 doctors, and studied
the relevant drug-related judicial proceedings and the intake
records of every mental hospital in British India. As a result
they concluded: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the
    Commission are of opinion that their moderate use produces no
    moral injury whatever. There is no adequate ground for
    believing that it injuriously affects the character of the
    consumer. Excessive consumption, on the other hand, both
    indicates and intensifies moral weakness or depravity.
    Manifest excess leads directly to loss of self-respect, and
    thus to moral degradation. In respect to his relations with
    society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
    is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him
    to degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest
    practices; and occasionally, but apparently very rarely
    indeed, excessive indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to
    violent crime. But for all practical purposes it may be laid
    down that there is little or no connection between the use of
    hemp drugs and crime.87 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is quite clear, however, that the Indian Hemp Drug
Commission88 Report was not disseminated in the United States
until 1969 . </p>

<p>On the other hand, periodic reports of the Panama Canal Zone
Governor's Committee to study the physical and moral effects of
the use of marijuana were available to legislators before the
passage of the Uniform Act. After an investigation extending from
April to December 1925, the Committee reached the following
conclusions: </p>

<p>There is no evidence that marijuana as grown here is a
&quot;habit-forming&quot; drug in the sense in which the term is
applied to alcohol, opium, cocaine etc. or that it has any
appreciable deleterious in influence on the individual using
it.89 </p>

<p>In 1933, a similar Panama Canal Zone committee reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Delinquencies due to marijuana smoking which result in
    trial by military court are negligible in number when
    compared with delinquencies resulting from the use of
    alcoholic drinks which also may be classed as stimulants and
    intoxicants.90 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>About the time that the final Governor's Committee Report from
the Canal Zone was completed, a New Orleans physician, Dr.
Fossier, completed a study from which he concluded that marijuana
was a highly dangerous drug with habit-forming properties.91 This
piece would have remained relatively unnoticed due to the
obscurity of the journal in which it was published had it not
been picked up by the New Orleans District Attorney, Eugene
Stanley, and made the basis for his own article-Marihuana as a
Developer of Criminals92 which appeared in a law enforcement
journal. Mr. Stanley stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is an ideal drug to cut off inhibitions quickly. . . . </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At the present time the underworld has been quick to
    realize the value of this drug in subjugating the will of
    human derelicts to that of a master mind. Its use sweeps away
    all restraint, and to its influence may be attributed many of
    our present day crimes. It has been the experience of the
    Police and Prosecuting Officials in the South that
    immediately before the commission of many crimes the use of
    marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in by criminals so as
    to relieve themselves from the natural restraint which might
    deter them from the commission of criminal acts, and to give
    them the false courage necessary to commit the contemplated
    crime.93 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Stanley's article, based on no empirical data whatsoever,
was widely used by courts to corroborate early legislation and by
lobbyists to justify the later prohibitive legislation against
the hemp drugs.94 </p>

<p>In 1933 the following colloquy appeared in the Journal of the
American Medical Association: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Effects of Cannabis </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To the Editor:-I have been hearing about the smoking of
    cigarets dipped into or medicated with fluid extract of
    Cannabis americana. I can find nothing about the use of the
    drug by addicts. What is its immediate effect? What are its
    late effects? What is the minimum lethal dose? In what way
    does it differ from or resemble &quot;muggles&quot; in its
    action? While in Louisiana I was told that the use of
    marihuana causes dementia. Is this true' Please omit name. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>M.D., Illinois. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>ANSWER.-The effect of Cannabis americana is the same as
    that of Cannabis indica- and, of the effect of the latter,
    the books are so full that it is hardly necessary to detail
    them here. It must suffice here to say that cannabis, at the
    height of its action, usually produces hallucinations, with
    or without euphoria, and that these are followed by a deep
    sleep. Its most marked after-effect is the liability to the
    establishment of a craving for the drug, the habitual use of
    which undermines the intellectual qualities and the social
    value of the victim and leads to general physical
    deterioration. It is stated that smokers nearly always become
    imbecile in time. The minimum lethal dose is unknown, no
    fatalities having been reported in man. In view of the fact
    that one dose may kill one dog that has no marked effect on
    another, one must admit the possibility of a lethal effect on
    man. In view of what has been said, it must be admitted that
    &quot;marihuana,&quot; which is merely another name for
    Cannabis indica, may cause dementia.95 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reply contains no indication how or where the persons who
answered the question got their data. It seems clear from the
nature of the response that the medical community was quite
uncertain as to the effects of the drug in 1933. </p>

<p>In 1934, Dr. Walter Bromberg, senior psychiatrist at Bellevue
Hospital, reported that marijuana was not a habit-forming drug
and was far less responsible for crime than other drugs such as
alcohol. In this study, Bromberg drew his data from examination
of 2,216 inmates convicted of felonies.96 Dr. Bromberg pointed
out that marijuana users tend to be passive in comparison to
users of alcohol and that the hemp drugs should lead to crime
only in cases of use by already psychopathic types. 97 </p>

<p>This then was the extent of medical evidence available to
laymen and legislators alike at the time the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act and the fast prohibitions of marijuana were enacted in
most states. We can conclude the following from our brief review
of the medical literature. (1) Little was really known about the
effects of marijuana use-there were few studies and what studies
there were had serious methodological flaws. (2) Even if the
studies we record had been adequate methodologically, they
appeared generally in obscure medical not widely read by laymen.
(3) Of these studies, most found marijuana relatively harmless
especially in contrast to use of alcohol. (4) None of these
studies were considered in either the formulation or the passage
of the Uniform Act in the states examined. And what is more
astounding is that instead of consulting medical opinion,
legislators relied on lurid newspaper accounts of marijuana,
often provided by defendants in criminal prosecutions whose
motivation was to use marijuana to escape criminal
responsibility. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>5. Provisions of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
Supplemental Virginia Marijuana Statute</b> </p>

<p>Having studied the circumstances surrounding passage of the
Uniform Act and similar legislation in several states between
1932 and 1937, we shall briefly summarize the provisions of those
laws. </p>

<p>(a) Classification and Offenses.-The Virginia legislature made
no changes in the Uniform Act as drafted by the Commissioners and
did not include the supplementary marijuana provisions in passing
that Act.98 In 1936, Virginia passed special marijuana
legislation99. which defined cannabis exactly as did the
definitional provision of the Uniform Act. Both the special
marijuana statute in Virginia and the Uniform Act prohibited
possession, transfer and cultivation of the drug100 but did not
refer to the more specific acts that later came to be separated
and punished more heavily, such as sale to a minor and possession
of more than a certain amount. </p>

<p>(b) Penalties.-The Uniform Act contained no specific penalties
for its violations; the matter of supplying the appropriate
penalties was left to each state. Virginia punished first
violations of its Uniform Act by a fine not exceeding $100 and/or
imprisonment in jail not exceeding one year, and second and
subsequent offenses by a fine not exceeding $1,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years in the penitentiary.101
The penalties for violation of Virginia's 1936 marijuana statute
were stiffer than for violation of its Uniform Act. Each offense
was punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary for from one
to ten years or by confinement in jail for not more than twelve
months and/or by a fine up to $1,000, in the discretion of the
court or jury.102 </p>

<p>An analysis of penalties for violation of the marijuana
statutes enacted in other states at about the same time indicates
Virginia's penalties were atypically harsh. In New Jersey, for
instance, the penalty for unlawful possession and sale of
marijuana was that attaching to a high misdemeanor.103 In Rhode
Island the penalty for unlawful possession was a fine of not more
than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than threeyears or
both.104 For unlawful selling, Rhode Island provided a fine of
not more than $2,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years
or both.105 In Kentucky the penalty for a first offense violation
was a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 or jail
for not less than thirty days nor more than one year or both. For
second and subsequent offenses the statute required imprisonment
in the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than five
years.106 Finally, West Virginia penalized a first offender by a
fine not exceeding $100 or jail for not exceeding one year or
both, and subsequent offenders by fine not exceeding $1,000 or
imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding five years or
both.107 </p>

<p>This comparison indicates that Virginia penalties could be
more severe than the average. Moreover, Virginia did not
distinguish in penalty between possession and sale of the drug,
and violation of Virginia's separate marijuana law could be more
heavily penalized than violation of the Uniform Act. </p>

<p>97 Id. at 309; see Facts and Fancies About Marijuana, LITERARY
DIGEST, Oct. 24, 1936, at 7-8. This presentation begins by
digesting Dr. Bromberg's article for laymen: </p>

<p>It is clear from this study [of 2,216 criminals convicted of
felonies] that in this region the drug is a breeder of crime only
when used by psychopathic types in whom the drug allows the
emergence of aggressive, sexual or antisocial tendencies. . . .
It is quite probable that alcohol is more responsible as an agent
for crime than is marihuana. </p>

<p>The article continues: </p>

<p>The following facts stand out in social and medical reports: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug, as is heroin or
opium. </p>

<p>2. It prolongs sensations; it is in high favor as an
aphrodisiac. </p>

<p>3. It is the most inexpensive of drugs; marihuana cigarettes
usually selling at from three to twenty-five cents each. </p>

<p>The article then describes the effects of marijuana: </p>

<p>After smoking from one to three &quot;reefers,&quot; if one
has not been told what to expect, the first effects of the drug
pass almost unnoticed-nothing, perhaps, but a slight twitching of
muscles of the neck, back or legs. The mind remains calm and
clear. Suddenly, without apparent cause, a chance remark . . .
sends the subject into a spasm of violent laughter. </p>

<p>Becoming calm again, while the drug continues to exert its
weird effects, the smoker finds ideas crowding through his brain
with bewildering rapidity; those around him become slow-dull. Nor
is the language of his own tongue swift enough to keep pace with
his lightning thoughts. </p>

<p>Soon the self-esteem of the smoker begins to grow in like
proportion. . . . </p>

<p>Paradoxically, trifling discomforts become unbearable evils;
the flare of a match near-by brings a resentment that is
immediately transformed into an overwhelming desire for revenge.
But before the &quot;reefer man&quot; could possibly climb to his
feet, or even reach a hand for a gun or knife, new thoughts have
come crowding in.... </p>

<p>Above all other distinguishing effects of marihuana
intoxication is the fact that all normal conceptions of time and
space are lost. </p>

<p>As in the split-second dream that seems to last the night
through, time seems of interminable length; the clock stands
still for days. </p>

<p>Vision, too, takes on new concepts. Inconsiderable distances
become tremendous.... </p>

<p>Yet, throughout the intoxication, there is constant awareness
that the strange fancies rushing through the mind are not
natural, but purely the effects of the drug; unlike the
opium-cater, he is acutely conscious of those about him. He has
many of the sensations of the gay &quot;drunk&quot; at the ball. </p>

<p>Describing a pot-party: </p>

<p>There is little noise; windows are shut, keeping the smell of
smoking weeds away from what might be curious nostrils. </p>

<p>Nor is there any of the yelling, dashing about, playing of
crude jokes or physical violence that often accompany alcoholic
parties; under the effects of marihuana, one has a dread of all
these things. </p>

<p><b>THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE: AN INQUIRY
INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie* &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II**</i></font> </p>

<p><b>V. PASSAGE OF THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>The first assertion of federal authority over marijuana use
was the Marihuana Tax Act, passed in 1937. The obvious question,
from a historical point of view, is why such legislation was
thought to be necessary, especially after the brushfire passage
of the Uniform Act and related legislation in every state in the
previous few years. Enforcement difficulty and public hysteria
are two reasons which have been propounded for the federal
action. We subscribe to a third, one which we rejected with
respect to the uniform acts-Congress was hoodwinked by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. State Enforcement of the Uniform Law</b> </p>

<p>One of the primary arguments in support of the Marihuana Tax
Act was that the legislation was required to permit and
facilitate adequate enforcement of the Uniform Narcotic Drug
Act.1 Initial examination of enforcement statistics after passage
of the Uniform Act suggests that marijuana seizures and arrests
in most states rose dramatically. </p>

<p>However, we should be careful to note at the outset the
inadequacies of most drug statistics, which, especially during
this period, do not permit conclusive analysis regarding the
extent of enforcement. </p>

<p>Reporting officials frequently do not differentiate among the
drugs. Different jurisdictions employ different measures of
enforcement-number of arrests, convictions, kilograms of the drug
seized, or number of seizures; even where the same measures are
used, statistics are often compiled for different time frames. In
addition, changes in the definitions in the laws-such as a change
from considering cannabis as only the flowering top of the plant
to considering it the whole plant-can wildly distort the
statistics from year to year. To add to the confusion,
enforcement agencies can manipulate the data for their own uses;
if they must appear to be attacking the drug problem or to need
more resources, they can change radically the statistical
appearance of the enforcement problem by using, for example,
arrests as their enforcement measure. Finally, the mere passage
of prohibitive legislation will in itself be reflected in the
enforcement data. This is especially important for our study of
enforcement patterns in the states before passage of the
Marihuana Tax Act. As one commentator has explained: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A point that should be obvious but that is sometimes
    overlooked is that there are no official statistics relating
    to violations of a drug, law until the drug law is enacted.
    To compare official preenactment and postenactment data is to
    compare nothing to something, and naturally drug use will
    appear to rise.2 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all these reasons, the drug statistics from the period of
the 1930's must be used somewhat hesitantly to support any
contention about the extent of state enforcement before the
enactment of Marihuana Tax Act. With this caveat in mind, we
shall proceed, nevertheless, to do so. </p>

<p>Although Commissioner Anslinger testified at the hearings on
the Tax Act that state officials frequently asked for federal
assistance 3 it appears from the Federal Bureau's own statistics
that state and municipal agencies were proceeding with vigor to
stamp out marijuana use.4 We do not have fully accurate data, but
there are indications that both New York and Louisiana were
moving against marijuana use. In 1934, the New York police
discovered a large field of marijuana growing near the Brooklyn
Bridge. In making a related raid, the police also seized 1,000
marijuana cigarettes.5 In 1935, the police burned a marijuana
crop found growing on the grounds of the Welfare Island
penitentiary.6 Throughout 1936, the narcotics division of the New
York police found and destroyed several marijuana crops growing
in and around the city.7 Fragmentary figures are available on law
enforcement in Louisiana which indicate there were 219 arrests on
marijuana charges in New Orleans alone from 1930 until April of
1936.8 In Louisiana as a whole for 1936 over 1,195 pounds of bulk
marijuana were seized.9 </p>

<p>This evidence suggests that state authorities in areas where
marijuana use had become common at all were dealing fairly
effectively with the trade in the drug. Although some states may
have hoped that passage of a federal law dealing with marijuana
would reduce the enforcement burden on state and local police and
bring additional federal services and money,10 the law cannot
really be justified as filling an enforcement void. Nevertheless,
this was one of the most effective arguments advanced by
Commissioner Anslinger in the halls of Congress. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. Public Hysteria or Continued Public Ignorance?</b> </p>

<p>Some observers have attributed passage of the Tax Act to
public hysteria.11 In support of this contention they show that
there was a marked increase in the number of titles dealing with
marijuana in the Readers' Guide to Periodical Literature from
1936 until 1939, compared with the total absence of articles on
this subject in preceding years.12 It should be noted, however,
that only seven articles treating marijuana or hashish appeared
from 1920 to August 1937, when the Tax Act was passed.13 With
respect to medical opinion, the AMA Journal presented an article
opposing the enactment of the Tax Act and arguing, as did their
representative at the Tax Act hearings, 14 that existing state
laws were sufficient if properly enforced.15 </p>

<p>It seems the national media and medical opinion were far from
hysterical at the time the Tax Act passed. There were a few local
newspaper campaigns against the drug, but they tended to peak
about two years before the passage of the Act and were isolated
instances of public support for the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act.16
Moreover, these atypical state scares did not draw national
attention. </p>

<p>In fact, whatever publicity the &quot;marijuana problem&quot;
received during this period was attributable to Commissioner
Anslinger and his office, who conducted an active educational
campaign for federal legislation. They prepared press stories on
the dangers of the drug and traveled around the country
disseminating propaganda.17 Despite these efforts, however,
public knowledge of the marijuana proposals was minimal at best.
The New York Times contained nine references to marijuana from
January 1936 until it reported on August 3, 1937,18
&quot;President Roosevelt signed today a bill to curb traffic in
the narcotic, marihuana, through heavy taxes on
transactions.&quot; </p>

<p>As in prior years, marijuana was still not a matter of public
attention, and the so-called &quot;problem&quot; and the federal
proposal to cure it went virtually unnoticed by most of the
American public. At the same time, however, the
&quot;educational&quot; campaign conducted by the Bureau to
inform the Congress of the dimensions of the &quot;problem&quot;
was highly successful. In this sense, the Bureau itself created
the &quot;felt need&quot; for federal legislation; the Bureau-and
not public hysteria which it was unable to arouse-was the major
force behind the Tax Act. We assign to the Bureau the
instrumental role with respect to passage of the Tax Act even
though we did not do so with respect to the Uniform Act. So
successful were the Commissioner's efforts in the Congress that
the hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and the
floor debate on the bill are near comic examples of dereliction
of legislative responsibility. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>C. The Tax Act Hearings</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Note from Cliff Schaffer:</b> Interested readers may refer
to the full text of the hearings for the <a
href="../../../hemp/taxact/taxact.htm">Marihuana Tax Act</a>, and
related documents, also on this site. </p>

<hr>

<p>Although the Marihuana Tax Act was modeled after the Harrison
Act, marijuana was not simply included in the earlier act
primarily for three reasons. First, the importation focus of the
Harrison Act was inappropriate for marijuana because there were
domestic producers.20 </p>

<p>Second, since cannabis had been removed from the United States
Pharmacopoeia and had no recognized medicinal uses, the variety
of medical exceptions in the Harrison Act were inapplicable.21
Third, even though the Supreme Court had upheld the Harrison
Act's prohibition against purchase by unregistered persons of the
designated drugs, there was some uncertainty whether the earlier
5-4 decision22 would be followed. Accordingly, the Marihuana Tax
Act imposed a prohibitive tax of $100 an ounce on the designated
transactions, rather than prohibit the purchases directly.23 </p>

<p>The brief three days of hearings on the Act24 present a case
study in legislative carelessness. At no time was any primary
empirical evidence presented about the effects of the drug, and
the participating congressmen seem never to have questioned the
assumed evils. Furthermore, the only real concerns seem to have
been that farmers would be inconvenienced by having to kill a
plant which grew wild in many parts of the country, and that the
birdseed, paint and varnish, and domestic hemp industries would
be damaged by passage of the law.25 Finally, the one witness
appearing in opposition to the bill, Dr. William C. Woodward,
legislative counsel of the American Medical Association and an
early and respected participant in the drafting of the Uniform
Narcotic Drug Act,26 was roundly insulted for his audacity in
daring to question the wisdom of the Act. </p>

<p>We reproduce in the following few pages some of the dialogue
from the hearings, to give the reader the flavor of these
ramshackle proceedings, and to allow him to understand more fully
the pyramiding of absurdity represented by the amendments of the
1950's. From the hearings we extract contemporary perception of
use patterns and harmful effects of marijuana, the quality of
medical and other evidence presented, and a short glimpse at how
the witnesses were treated by the committee. </p>

<p><b>1. Who Were Users?</b> </p>

<p>The record of the hearings indicates quite clearly that the
Federal Narcotics Bureau was anxious for the committeemen to
believe marijuana use was a relatively new phenomenon that was on
the increase in America.27 Once again, marijuana use and the
Mexican minority were closely linked: &quot;The Mexican laborers
have brought seeds of this plant into Montana and it is fast
becoming a terrible menace, particularly in the counties where
sugarbeets are grown.&quot;28 Again, also, marijuana was
presented as the agent by which the underworld class hoped to
enslave American youth.29 The youth of the marijuana users was
contrasted with the increasing age of the usual opiate addict.
Perhaps most interestingly for later developments, Commissioner
Anslinger succinctly noted that heroin addicts and marijuana
users came from totally different classes and that the use of one
drug was unrelated to use of the other: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> This drug is not being used by those
    who have been using heroin and morphine. It is being used by
    a different class, by a much younger group of people. The age
    of the morphine and heroin addict is increasing all the time,
    whereas the marihuana smoker is quite young. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Dingell. </b>I am just wondering whether the
    marihuana addict graduates into a heroin, an opium or cocaine
    user. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. Anslinger.</b> No sir; I have not heard of a case
    of that kind. I think it is an entirely different class. The
    marihuana addict does not go in that direction30 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hearings shed no more light on who was using the drug and
in what numbers. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. What's Wrong with Marijuana?</b> </p>

<p>If the proceedings did not shed light on the patterns of
usage, this in no way was an obstacle to unanimity on the evils
of the drug-insanity, criminality and death. Three major sources
were relied on to support this consensus (1) a variety of horror
stories from newspapers cited by Mr. Anslinger and others about
atrocious criminal acts committed by individuals under the
influence of the drug;31 (2) studies by Eugene Stanley, the
District Attorney of New Orleans, linking the drug and the
population of the Louisiana jails;32 and (3) some inconclusive
experimentation on dogs.33 As we noted earlier, the newspaper
stories about crimes committed under the influence of marijuana
have two things in common: The reports are unsubstantiated, and
many of the accused invoked their use of marijuana as a defense
to the charge .34 </p>

<p>The New Orleans report concluded: &quot;After an exhaustive
research on marijuana from its earliest history to the present
time, this drug is in our judgment the one that must be
eliminated entirely.&quot; 35 What was this exhaustive research?
It appears to have been nothing but quotations from the most
hysterical series of newspaper articles to appear at that time36
and reports of the number of marijuana addicts to be found in the
prison population.37 The relation of these figures to the
conclusion that the drug must be regulated was never established.
</p>

<p>The Stanley study38 was even less well documented and even
more outrageous in its description of the effects of marijuana
use. &quot;It is an ideal drug to quickly cut off
inhibitions.&quot; 39 For this proposition Stanley relied on the
story of the Persian &quot;Assassins&quot; who allegedly
committed acts of terror while under the influence of hashish.
Although Stanley included in his list of references the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission Report, it is clear he made little effort
to catalogue the then available data but contented himself with a
number of bold and undocumented assertions. In reading the
hearings, one continues to expect some report of a medical or
scientific survey, and instead one finds these two reports by New
Orleans law enforcers. The contrary conclusions of the Canal Zone
studies were not even mentioned. </p>

<p>Finally, a scientific study of the effects of marijuana was
presented, but, in keeping with the overall tone of the hearings,
this was the most preposterous evidence of all. The Treasury
Department presented a pharmacologist who had tested the effects
of the cannabis drugs on dogs. 40 He concluded that
&quot;[c]ontinuous use will tend to cause the degeneration of one
part of the brain.&quot; 41. </p>

<p>One paragraph later, however, this scientist stated:
&quot;Only about 1 dog in 300 is very sensitive to the
test.&quot;42 Later in the doctor's testimony, after he had
stated over and over the potential evils found from the testing
on dogs, he was unable to make the crucial link between a dog's
response to the drug and the human response. More incredibly, as
the following exchange points out, the doctor really had no
knowledge of what effect the drug had on the dogs, since he was
not familiar with the psychology of dogs: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack</b>. Have you experimented upon any
    animals whose reaction to this drug would be similar to that
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> The reason we use dogs is because the
    reaction of dogs to this drug, closely resembles the reaction
    of human beings. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. McCormack. </b>And the continued use of it, as you
    have observed the reaction on dogs, has resulted in the
    disintegration of the personality? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Munch.</b> Yes. So far as I can tell, not being a
    dog psychologist .... 43 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward, the sole witness representing the American
Medical Association, noted the inadequacy of these medical
statistics. We include his statement on that point in full: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That there is a certain amount of narcotic addiction of an
    objectionable character no one will deny. The newspapers have
    called attention to it so prominently that there must be some
    grounds for their statements. It has surprised me, however,
    that the facts on which these statements have been based have
    not been brought before this committee by competent primary
    evidence. We arc referred to newspaper publications
    concerning the prevalence of marihuana addiction. We are told
    that the use of marihuana causes crime. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of
    Prisons to show the number of prisoners who have been found
    addicted to the marihuana habit. An informal inquiry shows
    that the Bureau of Prisons has no evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You have been told that school children are great users of
    marihuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned from the
    Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the habit,
    among children. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Children's Bureau shows that they have had
    no occasion to investigate it and know nothing particularly
    of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Inquiry of the Office of Education-and they certainly
    should know something of the prevalence of the habit among
    the school children of the country, if there is a prevalent
    habit-indicates that they have had no occasion to investigate
    and know nothing of it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, there is in the Treasury Department itself, the
    Public Health Service, with its Division of Mental Hygiene.
    The Division of Mental Hygiene was, in the first place, the
    Division of Narcotics. It was converted into the Division of
    Mental Hygiene, I think, about 1930. That particular Bureau
    has control at the present time of the narcotics farms that
    were created about 1929 or 1930 and came into operation a few
    years later. No one his been summoned from that Bureau to
    give evidence on that point. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Informal inquiry by me indicates that they have had no
    record of any marihuana or Cannabis addicts who have even
    been committed to those farms. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Bureau of the Public Health Service has also a
    division of pharmacology. If you desire evidence as to the
    pharmacology, of Cannabis, that obviously is the place where
    you can get direct and primary evidence, rather than the
    indirect hearsay evidence. 44 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Woodward's testimony clearly manifests the deficiencies of
the hearings, for at no time did the congressional committee hear
primary sources of competent medical evidence before labeling
cannabis the producer of crime and insanity. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. How Dare You Dissent!</b> </p>

<p>Following the testimony of the Treasury Department and its
witnesses, the only witnesses who came forward were
representatives of legitimate industries that feared the Tax Act
would damage their businesses, because manufacture of their
products required some part or parts of the cannabis plant.45
These witnesses were assured that the Tax Act would have little
if any impact on their operations .46 </p>

<p>The one witness who opposed the adoption of the Act was
roundly accused of obstructionism and bad faith. Dr. Woodward,
one of the chief drafters of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act,
appeared on behalf of the AMA to suggest that, if there was to be
any regulation of the cannabis drugs at all, it should be added
to the Harrison Act and not be the subject of this separate, and
he felt inadequately considered, legislative proposal.47 We have
already examined Dr. Woodward's skepticism on the dangers of the
drug. He added to this a thinly veiled attack on the lack of
cooperation the AMA had received from the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics.48 Finally, he advocated either assisting state
enforcement of their existing laws dealing with the drug or at
most including marijuana as a regulated and taxed drug under the
Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Either because of antipathy to the AMA or because of the
audacity of these suggestions, the Committee members savagely
attacked both Dr. Woodward and the AMA. Witness the following
exchange, starting with the doctor's answer to questions why, he
had not proposed marijuana legislation </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>In the first place, it is not a
    medical addiction that is involved and the data do not come
    before the medical society. You may absolutely forbid the use
    of Cannabis by any physician, or the disposition of Cannabis
    by any pharmacist in the country, and you would not have
    touched your Cannabis addiction as it stands today, because
    there is no relation between it and the practice of medicine
    or pharmacy. It is entirely outside of the those two
    branches. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman.</b> If the statement that you have made
    has any relation to the question that I asked, I just do not
    have the mind to understand it; I am sorry. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward.</b> I say that we do not ordinarily come
    directly to Congress if a department can take care of the
    matter. I have talked with the Commissioner, with
    Commissioner Anslinger. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>The Chairman. </b>If you want to advise us on
    legislation, you ought to come here with some constructive
    proposals, rather than criticism, rather than trying to throw
    obstacles in the way of something that the Federal Government
    is trying to do. It has not only an unselfish motive in this,
    but the), have a serious responsibility. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Dr. Woodward. </b>We cannot understand yet, Mr.
    Chairman, why this bill should have been prepared in secret
    for 2 years without any intimation, even, to the profession,
    that it was being prepared .49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After accusing Dr. Woodward of obstruction, evasion and bad
faith, the Committee did not even thank him for his testimony.50 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>D. Congressional &quot;Deliberation&quot; and Action</b> </p>

<p>We noted earlier that the marijuana &quot;problem&quot; and
the proposed federal cure were virtually unnoticed by the general
public. Unable to arouse public opinion through its educational
campaign, the Bureau of Narcotics nevertheless pushed the
proposed legislation through congressional committees. The
Committee members were convinced by meaningless evidence that
federal action was urgently needed to suppress a problem that was
no greater and probably less severe than it had been in the
preceding six years when every state had passed legislation to
suppress it. The Committee was also convinced, incorrectly, that
the public was aware of the evil and demanded federal action. </p>

<p>The debate on the floor of Congress shows both the low public
visibility of the legislation and the nonchalance of the
legislators. The bill passed the House of Representatives in the
very late afternoon of a long session; many of the members were
acquainted neither with marijuana nor with the purpose of the
Act. When the bill first came to the House floor late on June 10,
1937, one congressman objected to considering the bill at such a
late hour, whereupon the following colloquy occurred: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. DOUGHTON. </b>I ask unanimous consent for the
    present consideration of the bill (H.R. 6906) to impose an
    occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in marihuana, to
    impose a transfer tax upon certain dealings in marihuana, and
    to safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and recording.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Clerk read the title of the bill. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to
    object, and notwithstanding the fact that my friend, Reed, is
    in favor of it, is this a matter we should bring up at this
    late hour of the afternoon? I do not know anything about the
    bill. It may be all right and it may be that everyone is for
    it, but as a general principle, I am against bringing up any
    important legislation, and I suppose this is important, since
    it comes from the Ways and Means Committee, at this late hour
    of the day.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN.</b> Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will
    yield, I may say that the gentleman from North Carolina has
    stated to me that this bill has a unanimous report from the
    committee and that there is no controversy about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL. </b>What is the bill? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. RAYBURN</b>. It has something to do with something
    that is called marihuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some
    kind. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. FRED M. VINSON. </b>Marihuana is the same as
    hashish. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Mr. SNELL.</b> Mr. Speaker, I am not going to object
    but I think, it is wrong to consider legislation of this
    character at this time of night.51 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On June 14 when the bill finally emerged on the House floor,
four representatives in one way or another asked that the
proponents explain the provisions of the Act. Instead of a
detailed analysis, they received a statement of one of the
members of the Ways and Means Committee repeating uncritically
the lurid criminal acts Anslinger had attributed to marijuana
users at the hearings. After less than two pages of debate. the
Act passed without a roll call.52 When the bill returned as
amended from the Senate, the House considered it once again, and
adopted as quickly as possible the Senate suggestions, which were
all minor.53 The only question was whether the AMA agreed with
the bill. Mr. Fred Vinson not only said they did not object when
in fact their committee witness had dissented strenuously, but he
also claimed that the bill had AMA support. After turning Dr.
Woodward's testimony on its head, he also called him by another
name, Wharton.54 </p>

<p>In summary, the Act passed the Congress with little debate and
even less public attention. Provoked almost entirely by the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics and by a few hysterical state law
enforcement agents hoping to get federal support for their
activities, the law was tied neither to scientific study nor to
enforcement need. The Marihuana Tax Act was hastily drawn, heard,
debated and passed; it was the paradigm of the uncontroversial
law. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>E. Provisions of the Act</b> </p>

<p>Except for the three differences noted above, the Marihuana
Tax Act is modeled directly after the earlier federal tax act
regulating the opiates -the Harrison Act. As with that Act, the
enforcement of the new marijuana tax was left to the Bureau of
Narcotics in the Treasury Department. Thus, as a result of the
1937 statute, the jurisdiction of the Bureau was increased
substantially.55 </p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act deals specifically with the seeds, resin
and most other parts and derivatives of the plant Cannabis Sativa
L. The Act requires persons importing, producing,56 selling or in
any other way dealing with the drug to pay an occupational tax
and to register with the Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
all transferees of marijuana are required to file a written order
form and to pay a transfer tax, $1 per ounce if registered and a
prohibitive $100 per ounce if not registered . 57 Possession of
the drug without a written order form constitutes presumptive
evidence of noncompliance with the Act. It is also unlawful for a
transferor to transfer the drug to a person who has not secured
the order form and paid the tax. As originally enacted, section
12 of the Act assessed a fine of not more than $2,000 and/or
imprisonment for not more than five years for violation of each
provision of the Act.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Footnotes and References </h2>

<p>1 The best example of this argument is contained in
Commissioner Anslinger's statement to the congressional committee
hearings on the Marihuana Tax Act: </p>

<p align="center"><b>STATE LAWS</b> </p>

<p>All of the States now have some type of legislation directed
against the traffic in marijuana for improper purposes. There is
no legislation in effect with respect to the District of Columbia
dealing with marijuana traffic. There is unfortunately a loophole
in much of this State legislation because of a too narrow
definition of this term. Few of the States have a special
narcotic law enforcement agency and, speaking generally,
considerable training of the regular peace officers will be
required together with increased enforcement facilities before a
reasonable measure of effectiveness under the State laws can be
achieved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>NEED FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION</b> </p>

<p>Even in States which have legislation controlling in some
degree the marijuana traffic, public officials, private citizens,
and the press have urged or suggested the need for national
legislation dealing with this important problem. A partial list
of States wherein officials or the press have urged the need for
Federal legislation on the subject are Colorado, Kansas, New
Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>The uniform State narcotic law has now been adopted by some 35
States, many of these including cannabis or marijuana within the
scope of control by that law. However, it has recently been
learned that the legislative definition of cannabis in most of
these laws is too narrow, and it will be necessary to have the
definition amplified in amendatory legislation in most of the
States, to accord with the definition in the pending Federal
bill. As is the case at present with respect to opium, coca
leaves, and their respective alkaloids, the uniform State law
does not completely solve the enforcement problem with respect to
marijuana but it will provide the necessary supplement to the
Federal act and permit cooperation of State and Federal forces,
each acting within its respective sphere, toward suppression of
traffic for abusive use, no matter in what form the traffic is
conducted. The Bureau of Narcotics, under the Marijuana Taxing
Act, would continue to act as an informal coordinating agency in
the enforcement of the Uniform State law, exchanging information
as between the respective State authorities in the methods of
procedure and attempting to secure true uniformity in the
enforcement of the act in the various States which have adopted
it. </p>

asked whether the information at congressional disposal changed
so drastically between 1937 and 1956 as to justify the statutory
presumption enacted at that time, 21 U.S.C. 5 176a (1964),
providing that possession of marijuana was presumptive evidence

<p>Young men between the ages of 16 and 25 are frequent smokers
of marihuana; even boys of 10 to 14 are initiated (frequently in
school groups); to them as to others, marihuana holds out the
thrill. Since the economic depression the number of marihuana
smokers was increased by vagrant youths coming into intimate
contact with older psychopaths. </p>

particularly lurid stores were the product of desperate
defendants, who, upon being caught red-handed in the commission
of crime, sought mitigation of their penalties by claiming to be
under the influence of the drug. See Bromberg, Marijuana: A
Psychiatric Study, 113 J.A.M.A. 4 (1939). Bromberg cautions,

that crime is caused by addiction to marihuana demands [sic]

<p><b>VI. THE 1950's: HARSHER PENALTIES AND A NEW RATIONALE-THE
&quot;STEPPING STONE&quot; THEORY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1950's witnessed the advent of an extremist legislative
policy with respect to drugs generally and marijuana in
particular. For the first time in our national history, there was
public interest in narcotic drugs. Apparently there had been an
increase in narcotic drug abuse in the late 40's, and the public
mind was ripe for the FBN propaganda. In the paranoid atmosphere
of the times, the call for harsher penalties was soothing.
Unfortunately, marijuana was caught in the turbulence of this
era. Although the pharmacological facts about the drug were
beginning to emerge, congressional furor was aroused by the novel
assertion, rejected by Commissioner Anslinger in 1937, that use
of marijuana led to use of harder drugs. This new plateau of
misinformation was to provide the base for continual escalation
of penalties and proliferation of offenses throughout the decade.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>A. The Boggs Act and Its Progeny: The First Escalation</b> </p>

<p>In 1951 Congress passed the next major piece of federal
narcotics legislation-the Boggs Act .2 The importance of this
legislation is that provided much harsher penalties for all drug
violators. Also, for the first time on the federal level,
marijuana and other narcotics were lumped together as a result of
the Act's provision for uniform penalties for violators of either
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act3 or the Marihuana Tax
Act.4 This indiscriminate treatment of marijuana as just another
narcotic drug flew in the face of contemporary testimony
challenging the assumption that the hemp drugs were addictive,
crime-producing, and likely to lead to insanity and death. New
testimony that marijuana was unlikely to be addictive was buried
under the new rationale for harsh penalties against offenders of
the marijuana laws-that the drug inevitably is the stepping stone
to heroin addiction. Eventually, the states followed the federal
lead in striking out against drug violators with the same
mindless fervor that characterized their anti-communist
campaigns. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. The Problem: Increased Narcotics Use</b> </p>

<p>The hearings before the Subcommittee of the House Ways and
Means Committee and the floor debate show that the primary reason
for passage of the Boggs Act was the increase in narcotic use in
the period 1948-1951. Testimony and evidence from a wide variety
of sources indicated an abrupt and substantial increase in
addiction, especially among teenagers, between 1947 and 1951.5
Young people under 21 who had rarely been addicts suddenly became
a predominant group involved in addiction and narcotics crimes.6
Representative Boggs, speaking during the congressional debates
on his bill, enunciated a concern which was reflected in many
other quarters. After noting that there had been a 24 percent
increase in arrests for narcotics violations between 1949 and
1950 and a 77 percent increase between 1948 and 1950,
Representative Boggs stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most shocking part about these figures is the fact
    that there has been an alarming increase in drug addiction
    among younger persons. In the first- 6 months of 1946, the
    average age of addicted persons committed . . . at Lexington,
    Ky. was 37.5 years. Only 3 patients were under the age of 21.
    During the first 6 months of 1950, only 4 years later, the
    average had dropped to 26.7 years, and 766 patients were
    under the age of 21.... [I]n New York City alone it has been
    estimated that 1 out of every 200 teenagers is now addicted
    to some type of narcotics.7 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later he said, &quot;We need only to recall what we have read
in the papers in the past week to realize that more and more
younger people are falling into the clutches of unscrupulous dope
peddlers . . . .&quot; 8 </p>

<p>Representative Boggs then proceeded to insert in the record
eleven newspaper and magazine articles dated between May 2 and
July 16, 1951.9 The Washington Evening Star of July 16 (the day
of the debate) carried a story on the results of a mayor's
committee report on drug addiction in New York City. According to
the newspaper, &quot;between 45,000 and 90,000 persons in New
York City are using illicit dope.... Based on the city's
population of 7,835,099, that would be 1 out of every 87 or 1 out
of 174 persons.&quot; The paper indicated that the report showed
an increase in addiction among teenagers, and it called for
&quot;more severe penalties for dope sellers, and for wholesale
revisions of Federal and State penal statutes relating to
sale.&quot; </p>

<p>An article in Time magazine of June 25, 1951, inserted by Mr.
Boggs, related New York City School Superintendent William
Jansen's statement that one out of every 200 high school students
in the city was a user of habit forming drugs. The article went
on to describe the alarming increases in dope consumption&quot;
in other major cities and the ease with which school children
obtained narcotics. Another article, in the Washington Evening
Star of June 12, 1951, contained statements by a member of the
staff of the Attorney General of New York to the effect that
between 5,000 and 15,000 of New York City's 300,000 high school
students were drug addicts. To supplement the stock figures,
these articles included the testimony of witnesses who described
their own acts of prostitution and thievery, the loss of
educational opportunities, the death of addicts from &quot;hot
shots,&quot; the horrors of withdrawal, and a wide variety of
other aspects of drug abuse. </p>

<p>This evidence of increasing use of narcotics, especially among
the young, and the fear that narcotics use would continue to
spread, presented a problem that Congress felt needed a quick and
effective solution. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. The Solution: Harsher Penalties</b> </p>

<p>In the same way that the congressional hearings,
investigations and debates reflect the impetus for enactment of
the Boggs Act, they also reveal the official and public consensus
as to the solution-harsher penalties. Perhaps Commissioner
Anslinger best described the prevailing climate when he stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Short sentences do not deter. In districts where we get
    good sentences the traffic does not flourish.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There should be a minimum sentence for the second offense.
    The commercialized transaction, the peddler, the smuggler,
    those who traffic in narcotics, on the second offense if
    there were a minimum sentence of 5 years without probation or
    parole, I think it would just about dry up the traffic.10 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement before the Committee was quoted by
Representative Boggs during the congressional debate on his bill,
along with the Kefauver Committee's recommendation that
&quot;mandatory penalties of imprisonment of at least 5 years
should be provided for second offenders.&quot; 11 Representative
Boggs indicated that his bill was to incorporate the Kefauver
Committee recommendations of mandatory minimum sentences for drug
peddlers and had as its principal purpose ... to remove the power
of suspension of sentence and probation in the cases of second
and subsequent offenders against the narcotics and marijuana
laws, and to provide minimum sentences .... 12 </p>

<p>Moreover, Representative Boggs and others supported the
mandatory minimum sentences because they felt some federal had
been lax in enforcing the narcotic laws 13 and because they
believed harsher penalties had reduced crimes, particularly
kidnapping and the white slave trade, in other areas.14
Representative Edwin Arthur Hall of New York urged substitution
of his bill, which provided for minimum sentences of 100 years
for dope peddlers.15 Although there was some opposition to the
Boggs Act, notably by Representative Celler, who thought that the
mandatory minimum sentence provision would be unjust for
addicts,16 the majority opinion was clearly that mandatory
minimum sentences were necessary to insure punishment of
peddlers.17 In response to Mr. Celler's contention that young
addicts could be subjected to long prison terms because of the
loss of judicial discretion in sentencing, Representative Jenkins
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The enforcing officers will always have sympathy for the
    unfortunate consumer, especially if he is harmless. These
    enforcing officers are going to protect the little boys and
    little girls. They are not going to drag the high school boys
    and girls before the criminal courts until they know that
    they are collaborating with the peddlers18 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Boggs presented a more reasonable justification for
mandatory minimums: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[I]t is not the intention of this legislation to affect a
    teen-ager or any such person who has possession of narcotics.
    But the gentleman also knows that if we try to make a
    distinction between possession and peddling that we
    immediately open the law to all types of abuses.19 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Act as passed provided uniform penalties for violations of
the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act and the Marihuana Tax
Act. The penalties prescribed were: </p>

<p>First offense 2 - 5 years </p>

<p>Second offense 5 - 10 years </p>

<p>Third and subsequent offenses 10 - 20 years </p>

<p>Fine for all offenses $2,000.00 </p>

<p>The relatively low fines reflected a congressional belief that
monetary penalties were an insignificant deterrent.20 An
essential provision of the Act removed judicial discretion in
sentencing by providing that upon conviction for a second or
subsequent offense the imposition or execution of the sentence
could not be suspended nor probation granted. As in the nontax
predecessors of the Boggs Act since 1909 and the Marihuana Tax
Act, possession of a narcotic drug was sufficient for conviction
unless the defendant could explain the possession to the
satisfaction of the jury.21 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Marijuana and the Boggs Act</b> </p>

<p>Congressional and public attention was clearly focused on hard
narcotics use, primarily the opiates. Judging from the recorded
proceedings, especially the floor debate in the House, marijuana
seems to have been along for the ride, much as it had been during
enactment of the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. However, here there
was a conscious decision to include marijuana violations in the
new penalty provisions. Underlying this decision were
determinations that marijuana use had also increased during the
later 1940's, that it too was spreading to white teenagers, and
that the drug's dangers, warranted the harsh treatment
contemplated by the Act. </p>

<p>(a) Increased Use.-To test the allegation of an increase in
marijuana use during this period, we have used the seizure and
enforcement figures used by the proponents of the legislation.
These figures tend to sustain the hypothesis that marijuana
traffic increased from 1948 to 1951, following a decline
throughout the early 40's. However, the figures are also
consistent with other hypotheses, for example that improved
enforcement techniques and increased state-federal cooperation
had increased arrests. </p>

<p>Federal agents of the Narcotics Bureau began vigorously
enforcing the Marihuana Tax Act almost as soon as President
Roosevelt signed it into law. From October 1 to December 31,
1937, alone, the FBN made 369 seizures totaling 229 kilograms of
the drug.22 </p>

<p>Moreover, state officials made extensive seizures either in
conjunction with FBN agents or in pursuance of their newly-passed
state controls over marijuana's Marijuana seizures by federal
authorities hit their low point in 1945 when only 257 kilograms
were taken, 128 of which were seized by the FBN and the rest by
United States Customs agents .24 At this time the FBN had
approximately 180 agents.25 This low seizure figure suggests a
decrease in marijuana use throughout the early 1940 's.26 </p>

<p>Beginning in about 1948, however, the arrest and seizure 27
figures rose dramatically, the arrest figures rising 33 percent
from 1947 to 1948. These figures tend to corroborate the
Commissioner's assertion that there was a drastic increase in
narcotics use between 1948 and 1951 28 and to justify the
simultaneous calls for amendment of the narcotics and marijuana
laws.29 On the other hand, these figures could reflect increased
or I improved enforcement. For example, in 1949 the FBN had begun
to encourage the largest cities to form special narcotics squads
to deal especially with the drug problem.30 By 1951, however,
only New York and Los Angeles had formed the separate police
detail the FBN had requested .31 Thus even if one were tempted to
try to correct for improvements in the law enforcement machinery,
the seizure figures for the late 40's and 50's do sustain the
notion that the traffic in marijuana increased from 1948 to 1951.
</p>

<p>(b) Youthful Users.-As with the hard narcotics, Congress was
especially alarmed by the alleged spread of marijuana to white
teenagers and school children. Militating against this
proposition is evidence that marijuana use was not widespread
among the young as late as 1944. In that year, the famous La
Guardia Report reached the following conclusions among others:
Marijuana use was widespread in the Borough of Manhattan but
tended to be limited to certain areas, notably Harlem; the
majority of marijuana smokers were Negroes and Latin-Americans,
and marijuana smoking was not widespread among school children
.32 </p>

<p>The La Guardia study portrays marijuana use in this period as
a rather casual adjunct to ghetto life. Since it was not costly,
this euphoriant was well within the reach of ghetto residents. It
appears that throughout the early 40's marihuana use in the West
as well as in the East continued to be associated with the ethnic
minorities, especially in the inner city.33 </p>

<p>The fear that marihuana use would spread to white teenagers is
one that has recurred since the earliest legislative cognizance.
In fact, it was probably a factor in the early opium laws .34 We
have been unable to confirm whether the fear was justified at
this time, but in light of the documentation of increased
narcotics use among the young, we shall presume the same use
patterns to be true of marihuana. </p>

<p>(c) The Danger: A New Rationale.-The FBN had begun its
educational campaign for harsher marihuana penalties immediately
after passage of the Tax Act.&quot; In the early years, the
campaign was particularly effective with judges. For example, in
one of the first cases under the Tax Act, a Colorado judge
stated: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I consider marihuana the worst of all narcotics-far worse
    than the use of morphine or cocaine. Under its influence men
    become beasts, just as was the case with [the defendant].
    Marihuana destroys life itself. I have no sympathy With those
    who sell this weed. In the future I will impose the heaviest
    penalties. The Government is going to enforce this new law to
    the letter.36 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crime, pauperism and insanity rationale was accepted
unquestioningly as late as 1951.37 Under this rationale, harsher
penalties were certainly as imperative for marijuana offenders as
they were for opiate offenders. However, in a paper filed as an
exhibit to the hearings38 on the Boggs Act, Dr. Harris Isbell,
Director of Research at the Public Health Service hospital in
Lexington, Kentucky, exploded the traditional rationale. He
stated that marijuana was not physically addictive.39 Although he
postulated a definition of addiction which amounts to nothing
more than chronic intoxication 40 and noted the possibility of
&quot;temporary psychoses&quot; in &quot;predisposed
individuals,&quot; Isbell's description of marijuana was
extraordinarily favorable. Before the Kefauver Committee he
testified: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana smokers generally are mildly intoxicated,
    giggle, laugh, bother no one, and have a good time. They do
    not stagger or fall, and ordinarily will not attempt to harm
    anyone. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It has not been proved that smoking marijuana leads to
    crimes of violence or to crimes of a sexual nature. Smoking
    marijuana has no unpleasant after-effects, no dependence is
    developed on the drug, and the practice can easily be stopped
    at any time. In fact, it is probably easier to stop smoking
    marijuana cigarettes than tobacco cigarettes. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In predisposed individuals, marijuana may precipitate
    temporary psychoses and is, therefore, not an innocuous
    practice with them.41 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Isbell's statements that marijuana does not cause a
physical dependence were supported by other doctors, 42 prison
officials,43 and perhaps most significantly by the statement of a
number of narcotics addicts .44 </p>

<p>Despite this testimony the legislators approved greatly
increased penalties for marijuana users. The crucial reason for
this severe treatment can be seen in the following colloquy
during the House subcommittee hearings: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Boggs. From just what little I saw in that
    demonstration, I have forgotten the figure Dr. Isbell gave,
    but my recollection is that only a small percentage of those
    marijuana cases was anything more than a temporary degree of
    exhilaration .... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mr. Anslinger. The danger is this: Over 50 percent of
    those young addicts started on marijuana smoking. They
    started there and graduated to heroin; they took the needle
    when the thrill of marijuana was gone.45 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many others -doctors ,46 crime prevention experts,47 police
and narcotics bureau officials48 -testified to the link between
marijuana use and ultimate heroin addiction. Representative Boggs
himself summed up this novel danger of marijuana in one of the
few statements even to mention marijuana in House floor debate: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our younger people usually start on the road which leads
    to drug addiction by smoking marijuana. They then graduate
    into narcotic drugs-cocaine, morphine, and heroin. When these
    younger persons become addicted to the drugs, heroin, for
    example, which costs from $8 to $15 per day, they very often
    must embark on careers of crime . . . and prostitution . . .
    in order to buy the supply which they need.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The passage of this new Federal Act marked a significant shift
in rationale for the illegal status of marijuana; that status
became more entrenched by the indiscriminate lumping of marijuana
with the other narcotic drugs. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. The State Response: Mindless Escalation</b> </p>

<p>While the Boggs Act was still pending in Congress, the Bureau
of Narcotics encouraged the states to modify their existing
narcotic and marijuana legislation to enact &quot;penalties
similar to those provided for in the Boggs bill [which] would be
of material assistance in the fight against the narcotic
traffic.&quot; 50 Seventeen states (including Virginia) and the
Territory of Alaska responded by passing &quot;little Boggs
Acts&quot; by 1953, and eleven other states increased their
penalties by 1956. </p>

<p>In 1951, seven states and the Territory of Alaska passed
penalty provisions similar to those contained in the Boggs
Act.,51 In addition, nine other states amended their drug laws to
provide for more severe penalties, but the provisions were
neither uniform nor identical to those provided for under the
federal measure. 52 In 1952, four more states, including
Virginia, amended the penalty provisions of their drug laws to
bring them in line with the Boggs Act.53 Six more states followed
suit in 1953.54 Finally, in 1955 and 1956 two states, Ohio and
Louisiana respectively, enacted penalty provisions which were
substantially more severe than those passed previously in any
Jurisdiction.55 </p>

<p>The Virginia &quot;little Boggs Act&quot; was signed into law
on April 1, 1952 ,56 after having passed both houses
unanimously.57 The measure was regarded as routine, and as one of
the &quot;less controversial&quot; proposals to come before the
legislature during the 1952 session.58 It cleared the House on a
day when bills were being passed &quot;at the rate of about one a
minute during some periods&quot; 59 and won Senate approval
during the final rush to complete business in the waning hours of
the 1952 General Assembly. </p>

<p>The Act produced three basic changes in Virginia's scheme of
narcotics control. It added marijuana to those drugs whose sale
was forbidden under the state's version of the Uniform Narcotic
Drug Act; it created the new substantive crime of sale to a
minor; and it provided for harsher penalties for violations of
the drug laws.60 </p>

<p>Prior to 1952, the Virginia anti-marijuana provision was
separate from those provisions governing the sale of
&quot;hard&quot; drugs. But the 1952 Act repealed this provision
and included marijuana under the state's general narcotic control
law. As a result, a person illegally selling marijuana became
subject to the same penalties imposed upon a person legally
vending such drugs as heroin, morphine and cocaine .61 </p>

<p>The heart of the 1952 Act was the provision for stiffer
penalties for the violation of Virginia's general narcotic laws
prohibiting the sale of drugs without a prescription. For the
first offense, the penalty was imprisonment in the penitentiary
for not less than three nor more than five years plus a fine of
not more than $1,000. For the second offense, the penalty was
imprisonment for not less than five nor more than ten years and a
fine of not more than $2,000. For the third and succeeding
offenses, the penalties were fines of not more than $3,000 and
imprisonment for not less than ten nor more than twenty years. </p>

<p>The 1952 Act also made it a felony to sell, barter, peddle,
exchange or otherwise dispense marijuana or any other narcotic
drug to a minor. Any person found guilty of such offense was
subject to imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years nor
more than thirty years, no part of which could be suspended, and
a fine of not more than $ 1,000 for the first offense, $2,000 for
the second offense and $3,000 for the third and subsequent
offenses. Such a provision exemplifies the increased
sophistication of anti-narcotic legislation during the 1950's.
Thus, the continued escalation of penalties for drug law
violators was followed in Virginia. Moreover, despite the public
concern and attention in the national media, in Virginia it is
plain that the 1952 amendments to the narcotic laws passed
virtually unnoticed in the press .62 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>B. The Late 1950's: Another Escalation of the Penalties</b>
</p>

<p>Whether because use had decreased or because the propagandists
had accomplished their main mission, the narcotics problem
dropped almost entirely from public view after the Boggs Act was
passed. Nevertheless, state and federal police authorities, armed
with data suggesting that the strengthening of the drug laws had
at least halted the increase in drug use, pressed for further
increases in penalties in order entirely to root out the drug
menace. 63 Without significant debate or public interest,
Congress responded by passing the Narcotic Control Act of 1956
.64 </p>

<p>Although the legislators paid even less attention to marijuana
than they had in 1951, the precedent there established of
classifying marijuana with hard narcotics resulted in a
proliferation of marijuana offenses and a further increase in
penalties. In some ways, this legislation represents the
high-water mark of uninformed public policy regarding marijuana.
In almost every respect, the provisions of the Act and the
legislative motivation bear absolutely no rational relation to
marijuana's pharmacology and to the drug's actual use and traffic

<p><b>I. Provisions of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956</b> </p>

<p>Public Law 728, an act intended to make more effective control
of the narcotic drugs and marijuana, was approved on July 18,
1956. It amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the
Narcotic Drugs Import and Export ACt65 primarily in the direction
of increasing still further the penalties for violation of those
acts and proliferating the scope of federal control over the use,
possession and sale of narcotic drugs and marijuana. </p>

<p>The new law raised the potential fine for all narcotics and
marijuana offenses to $20,000 66 and increased the mandatory
minimum sentences for offenses in the prescription, registration
and possession categories to two, five and ten years for
successive offenses.67 No distinction was made between addicts
and traffickers with regard to these types of violations.
Violations of the sale, transfer and smuggling provisions of the
Act carry a minimum sentence of five years for first offenses and
ten years for all subsequent offenses. 68 In this connection the
Act created a new offense by prohibiting illegal importation of
marijuana and forbidding knowing receipt, concealment, purchase,
sale, and facilitation of transportation or concealment of such
illegally, imported marijuana .69 Simple possession was by
statute sufficient evidence of guilt to convict.70 This
provision, now 21 U.S.C.  176a, paralleled a similar
importation provision for narcotics originally passed in 1909. </p>

<p>In addition, any sale or transfer of any drug by an adult to a
was made punishable by a minimum ten-year sentence.71 Finally,
the Act made suspension, probation and parole unavailable to all
offenders except those convicted of a first offense for
possession, prescription or registration.72 </p>

<p>In addition to the increases in offenses and penalties, the
law contained wide variety of provisions relating to enforcement.
Customs and Narcotics Bureau agents were authorized to carry
weapons and to make arrests without a warrant on belief that a
drug violation had been committed .73 The Government was allowed
to appeal unfavorable decisions suppressing evidence74 and to
compel testimony from witnesses by a grant of immunity.75 In a
concession to those legislators who favored a wiretapping
provision, the new law created a category of offense based on the
use of communications instrumentalities in violation of the drug
laws.76 This provision carried penalties of a minimum two-year
sentence and up to a $5,000 fine. The Act required that citizens
who are drug users and drug law violators must register with the
immigration authorities upon entering or leaving the United
States .77 The Act also amended the Immigration and Nationality
Act to provide for deportation of alien drug users and drug law
violators .78 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>2. Marijuana-Along for the Ride</b> </p>

<p>The Narcotic Control Act of 1956 was premised on the same
beliefs as was the Boggs Act. Few if any of the legislators
recognized that marijuana was in any way different from the
physically addictive narcotics.79 The stepping stone concept was
now so widely accepted that only once during the extensive
congressional debates on the House and Senate versions of the
bill was the subject of marijuana as a separate substance even
raised. In a statement reflecting both ignorance of the basic
characteristics of marijuana and naive acceptance of the stepping
stone concept, Senator Daniel, Chairman of the Senate
subcommittee that investigated the drug problem, described
marijuana: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That is a drug which starts most addicts in the use of
    drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can lead to
    some of the worst crimes committed by those who are addicted
    to the habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin habit
    and then to the final destruction of the persons addicted.80 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Congress bought the FBN's propaganda lock, stock and
barrel, it is not surprising that there was no dissent from the
proposition that harsher penalties were the means to eliminate
illicit use and sale of all drugs.81 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>3. Trafficking Patterns</b> </p>

<p>The 1956 Act reflected an unsupported conception of the nature
of the marijuana traffic. Under the assumption that
&quot;peddlers&quot; of all drugs, marijuana included, are
controlled by organized crime, the Act assessed extremely heavy
penalties for sale, especially to minors. For example, the House
Ways and Means Committee report noted that &quot;narcotic
traffickers ... are in most cases well organized professional
racketeers.&quot; 82 Similarly, in recommending prohibition of
probation or suspension of sentence for first-offender peddlers,
the House subcommittee had asserted that if the first offender
peddler problem was not solved, there would eventually be
&quot;large scale recruiting of our youth by the upper echelon of
traffickers.&quot; 83 </p>

<p>While the reference to organized crime was undoubtedly valid
with respect to hard drugs, the assumption that marijuana traffic
was controlled by large-scale racketeers was completely
unsupported. The marijuana distribution pattern today is far
different than the distribution pattern for &quot;hard&quot;
drugs. On college campuses today, the marijuana seller is likely
to be a smoker who has a small amount he wants to sell. Unless
one is to believe that organized crime has abdicated a
distribution role to &quot;amateurs,&quot; it is difficult to
imagine that it controlled the distribution of marijuana in 1956.
Accordingly, the 1956 Act's widely divergent treatment of sale
and use of marijuana may not have been justified at the time of
enactment, and it certainly makes little sense today. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>4. Origin and Use</b> </p>

<p>A related misconception about the marijuana trade concerns the
new importation offenses. Underlying the presumption of knowing
concealment of smuggled marijuana arising from possession are two
findings that the mainstay of marijuana traffic is imported from
Mexico and that possessors are likely to be aware of that fact.
Even in 1956, such findings were dubious.84 As to the presumption
of importation, Commissioner Anslinger's estimate that 90 percent
of all marijuana seized by federal authorities had been smuggled
from Mexico85 was grossly misleading. The Federal Bureau of
Narcotics had practically abandoned the responsibility for
marijuana control to increasingly effective state narcotics
squads and to the Customs agents.86 Of course, federal figures
taken alone would suggest a high percentage of importation.
Furthermore, the Commissioner's conclusion was inconsistent with
an essential premise of the Tax Act87 and with other materials
before the Congress,88 all of which emphasized the large degree
of domestic cultivation. </p>

<p>As to the possessor's knowledge, the underlying assumption
again was that there was an organized trade pattern so that each
user knew where his drug came from. As we know, marijuana was
then a casual adjunct to ghetto life. It was a social, rather
than an economic, phenomenon limited almost exclusively to
unemployed or menially employed members of racial minorities in
the center cities.89 As applied to such a class of people, the
presumption is farcical.90 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>5. Enforcement Patterns</b> </p>

<p>Although the proliferation of federal offenses suggests on its
face that state enforcement was inadequate to cope with marijuana
trade or that increased use of the drug presaged increased
narcotics addiction, nothing could be farther from the truth.
Considering marijuana alone, the 1956 legislation was passed in
response to no need at all. The enforcement statistics confirm
our hypothesis that marijuana was simply &quot;along for the
ride.&quot; </p>

<p>First, as we noted above, federal arrests declined continually
after 1952.91 Although attributable in part to increased state
enforcement92 and to a conscious FBN decision to concentrate on
narcotics, the figures do suggest a decline in or at least a
stabilization of marijuana use by the middle fifties, even in
areas in which narcotics use continued unabated. Second, the
class of users does not seem to have changed at all during this
period. Arrest statistics still indicate that use was centered in
the ghetto areas of major cities93 in California, Texas,
Louisiana, Michigan, New York, and Illinois.94 However, because
statistics were not refined according to race, age, sex and often
even the drug used,95 we cannot state categorically that there
was no change in use patterns. 96 </p>

<hr>

<p><b>6. The Epitome of Irrationality: Virginia's 1958 Amendment</b>
</p>

<p>In 1958, Virginia's Uniform Drug Act was further amended to
make the &quot;possession of illegally acquired narcotic drugs
[which included marijuana] in any quantity greater than
twenty-five grains, if in solid form, or eight ounces, if in
liquid form,&quot; a crime punishable by a fine of not more than
$5,000 and imprisonment for not less than twenty nor more than
forty years .97 The effect of this enactment was to provide a
penalty for illegal possession that was more than twice as severe
as the penalty for unlawful sale and one and one-half times more
stringent than that for sale to a minor. It is incredible that
despite the extreme <a name="last">harshness of this penalty, the
measure passed both houses of the General Assembly with but one
dissenting vote, and no mention was made of it in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch during the period of February 14 to April 7, 1958.</a>
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Federal Narcotic Control Act of 1956 and
subsequent state legislation reflect the same basic congressional
and public misconceptions about the nature and dangers of
marijuana that characterized the early fifties. Even more
unchanged, and in fact strengthened by results under the Boggs
Act, was the assumption that the key to the solution of the
narcotic drug problem was the imposition of harsher penalties on
both users and traffickers in illicit drugs. Classification of
marijuana with narcotic drugs was now a foregone conclusion. In
fact, legislators seemed less aware that marijuana was a distinct
substance than they had been in 1951. </p>

<p>32 The conclusions of the <a href="../lag/lagmenu.htm">La
Guardia Report</a> are discussed in THE MARIHUANA PAPERS 277-410
(D. Solomon ed. 1966). The thirteen conclusions on the sociology
of marijuana use are so significant we include them in full: </p>

<p>From the foregoing study the following conclusions are drawn: </p>

<p>1. Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of Manhattan
but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be in other
sections of the United States. </p>

<p>2. The introduction of marihuana into this area is recent as
compared to other localities. </p>

<p>3. The cost of marihuana is low and therefore within the
purchasing power of most persons. </p>

<p>4. The distribution and use of marihuana is centered in
Harlem. </p>

<p>5. The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes and
Latin-Americans. </p>

<p>6. The consensus among marihuana smokers is that the use of
the drug creates a definite feeling of adequacy. </p>

<p>7. The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
addiction in the medical sense of the word. </p>

<p>8. The sale and distribution of marihuana is not under the
control of any single organized group. </p>

<p>9. The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine or heroin or
cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a market for
these narcotics by stimulating the practice of marihuana smoking.
</p>

<p>10. Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission
of major crimes. </p>

<p>11. Marihuana smoking is not widespread among school children.
</p>

<p>12. Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the practice
of smoking marihuana. </p>

<p>13. The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of
marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. Id. at 307. </p>

<p>33 The New York trend was also typical of Los Angeles.

Narcotics, 1 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 445, 453 (1954) (reporting a
breakdown by race of narcotics arrests by the Oakland police
department). </p>

<p>34 For example, in 1895 New York had passed a statute, ch.
1041, 5 1, [1895 ] N.Y. Laws 972, requiring instruction in public
schools on the effect of narcotics. </p>

(1951) [hereinafter cited as Boggs Act Hearings). </p>

<p>39 Dr. Isbell's paper stated: </p>

<p>Any definition [of addiction] which makes dependence an
essential feature will also not include intoxications with such
substances as cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamine. because
dependence on these substances is no more marked than is
dependence on tobacco and coffee and yet, in some ways,
intoxication with cocaine or marijuana is more harmful than is
addiction to morphine. Furthermore, definitions which exclude
cocaine and marijuana from the list of addicting drugs would
cause endless confusion because, in common parlance and legally,
both drugs arc regarded as addicting. </p>

to heroin was also supplied by sonic of the testimony by addicts
themselves. Of 27 addicts interviewed in part 14 of the Kefauver
Committee Hearings, 15 testified that they had started their drug
use with marijuana. This figure is misleading because a
substantial majority of the 12 who had not used marijuana were
addicts because of illness or were older addicts who had begun
using drugs before marijuana was readily available. See Kefauver

witnesses indicated that marijuana did in fact lead to the use of
the harder drugs but only one gave definite reasons why he
thought this transition inevitably took place. One male addict,
after stating that the average age of marijuana smokers was 13 or
14, stated: </p>

<p>You would very seldom find a person smoking marijuana who does
just that, he keeps on, and he gets to the point where he does
not have the same drive or feeling that he first had, and it is
like a stepping stone, he graduates to heroin. Kefauver Committee
Hearings, pt. 14, at 199-200. </p>

<p>Note that among many of these addicts curiosity and peer group
pressure was the primary factor in starting them into the use of
hard drugs. Id. at 12, 32, 94, 109, 254. Moreover, Representative
Boggs introduced some mystery into his statements during the
House debates by stating: </p>

<p>A study in February of 1950 of 602 case reports indicates that
53 percent . . . started their addiction to drugs by reason of
association with other addicts, and 7 percent of them started on
marijuana. </p>

page with Representative Boggs' statement that our young people
usually start on the road to drug addiction by smoking marijuana.

<p>79 The House Subcommittee on Narcotics, which produced what
became the essentials of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956,
revealed its knowledge of the distinction between marijuana and
narcotics solely by a footnote to the major heading
&quot;Narcotics&quot; which stated in fine print that the term
narcotics included marijuana. See U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; Am News
3294 (1956). </p>

<p>80 102 GONG. REC. 9015 (1956). </p>

<p>81 Representative Boggs, father of the Boggs Act and Chairman
of the Subcommittee on Narcotics of the House Ways and Means
Committee, stated that '[e]ffective steps to eliminate the
unlawful drug traffic requires ... the imposition of severe
punishment by the courts.&quot; Id. at 10689. The subcommittee,
which had set out to determine the effect of the Boggs Act on
narcotics traffic, U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. News 3291 (1956),
began its recommendations with calls for further increases in the
penalties for narcotics law violations. Id. at 3309. In fact, the
subcommittee felt that this was the only way to eliminate the
drug menace, and recommended that educational programs on the
evils of narcotics not be instituted in the schools for fear of
exciting the curiosity of young people. Id. at 3305. Both the
House Ways and Means Committee report and the subcommittee report
are filled with statements to the effect that harsher penalties
are the most effective weapons in the war against illicit
narcotics. Id. at 3281-3303 passim. The Ways and Means Committee
conclusion was succinct: &quot;Experience with the Boggs law . .
. has clearly demonstrated the efficacy of severe punishment in
reducing the illicit commerce in drugs.&quot; Id. at 3286. </p>

<p>Finally, Senator Daniel, speaking for the Senate subcommittee
investigating the drug situation in the United States, found
&quot;it absolutely necessary for the Congress of the United
States to strengthen the hands of our law enforcement officers
and provide higher penalties if we are to stop the narcotics
traffic in this country.&quot; 102 CONG. Rec. 9014 (1956). His
subcommittee also recommended the kind of across-the-board
increases in penalties that the Act eventually contained. </p>

<p>84 In holding unconstitutional the presumption of knowledge
that marijuana was smuggled, the Supreme Court in Leary v. United
States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), relied on the change in use patterns
from 1959 to 1967. We think the presumption was unconstitutional
when passed in 1956, both as to importation and knowledge. </p>

<p>86 The decline in the number of FBN arrests and seizures is
directly related to the increase in local and state enforcement
personnel. This thesis is supported by data from California where
statewide arrests soared while federal arrests remained stable.
Bureau of Criminal Statistics, California Dep't of Justice, Crime
in California (1956). See also A. LiNDESMITH, THE ADDICT AND THE
LAW 238 (1963). One commentator has suggested that except for the
years immediately after the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,
when the Bureau wanted to concentrate on its newly acquired
enforcement field, the FBN arrest data show clearly its emphasis
on the hard narcotics. Mandel, Problems with Official Drug
Statistics, 21 STAN. L. REV. 991, 1019-20 (1969). </p>

hearings included the testimony of an experienced federal Customs
official that high quality marijuana was being grown near the
Texas cities of Laredo and Brownsville. Daniel Committee Hearings
3488-89. In addition, the Attorney General of Ohio noted that
marijuana may grow unnoticed along roadsides and vacant lots in
many parts of the country.&quot; Id. at 4814. Also, a bulletin
issued by the Philadelphia Police Academy recited that
&quot;[plenty of marijuana is found growing in this city.&quot;

<p>90 This is especially true with respect to the young and black
minorities. The presumption has validity only as applied to
recently immigrated Mexicans. Cf. Chein, The Status of
Sociological and Social Psychological Knowledge Concerning
Narcotics, in NARCOTIC DRUG ADDICTION PROBLEMS 146, 155 (R.
Livingston ed. 1963). Mr. Chein reports a shift in drug use from
1930-1960 from old to young and a continued increase in the
percentage of drug users who are Black or Spanish-speaking. </p>

<p>91 The number of federal arrests for marijuana violations fell
from 1288 in 1952 to 169 in 1960. TRAFFIC IN Opium 26 (1952); id.
at 69 (1960). </p>

<p>92 By 1954, many major states and cities had special narcotics
squads. See Daniel Committee Hearings 13 -14, 1 10. </p>

<p>93 Cf. TRAFFIC IN Opium 66 (1956); id. at 41 (1959). The FBN
charts show clearly the extraordinary incidence of drug abuse
among Blacks, Mexican-Americans and other minority communities. </p>

<p>94 Daniel Committee Hearings, exhibit 7, at 267-71. Local
arrests in those six states accounted for 2,822 of the 3,205
marijuana arrests made by local law enforcers in 1954. </p>

<p>95 For example, the statistics in TRAFFIC IN Opium seldom even
distinguish among the drugs involved, and the FBI Uniform Crime
Statistics frequently report all drug related arrests together,
with no delineation of the type of drug used or the nature of the
offender. </p>

<p>96 Chein, supra note 90, at 152, suggests that whatever
patterns of drug use existed in the fifties were merely
continuations of patterns observed in the thirties. </p>

INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><font size="2"><i>Richard J. Bonnie &amp; Charles H.
Whitebread, II</i></font> </p>

<h2>VII. MARIJUANA USERS IN THE COURTS: 1930-1965</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having studied the evolution of legislative hostility to
marijuana from a regional phenomenon with racial overtones to a
nationwide paranoia, it is worthwhile to consider the fate of
marijuana users in the courts during this evolutionary period.
After the courts had summarily rejected the substantive
constitutional arguments, appeals in marijuana cases tended to
focus on three contentions particularly germane to drug
violations: procedural objections arising from interrelated
statutory schemes on the state and federal levels punishing
essentially the same conduct; objections to police conduct
intrinsic to victimless crimes; and objections to sufficiency of
evidence at trial. Like their legislative colleagues, state and
federal translated what they knew of the drug's mythical effects
into overt hostility. Coupled with the traditionally conservative
treatment afforded the rights of criminal defendants, especially
in state prosecutions, this judicial hostility produced
ever-lengthening sentences and few reversals. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>A. Statutory Fantasies: The Complications of
Federal Legislation</b></font> </p>

<p><b>1. Quadruple &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and the &quot;Killer
Weed&quot;</b> </p>

<p>When Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937, marijuana
had already been included in the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act and
every state had enacted some form of marijuana prohibition.1 In
addition to its ostensible revenue-raising function, the Act was
obviously designed both to deter further use of the drug 2 and to
facilitate enforcement of the state laws.3 The statute assured
the availability to state prosecutors of the order forms filed
with the IRS at the time of payment of the tax. 4 Congress had
thought that the order forms and registration requirements would
develop an &quot;adequate means of publicizing dealings in
marihuana in order to tax and control the traffic
effectively.&quot;5 </p>

<p>Thus, after 1937, possession of marijuana without filing the
transfer form and paying the federal tax constituted a violation
of both state and federal law;- yet filing the form and paying
the tax would probably not have eliminated the buyer's exposure
to prosecution under state law. Indeed, compliance would probably
have readily identified the buyer to state officials. To this
unfairness the courts paid no heed, noting that exposure to state
and federal prosecution for the same act did not constitute
double jeopardy7 and that the fifth amendment did not protect
defendants from prosecution for violation of state law.8 </p>

<p>After passage of the 1956 federal narcotic drug legislation9
possession of marijuana constituted at least one, and often two,
additional crimes. First, the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export
Act was amended10 in 1956 to punish directly illegal
importation11 of marijuana or other dealings in the drug with
knowledge that it had been illegally imported. Since mere
possession was sufficient evidence to convict under the Act, 12
possession without registration and order form now constituted
three crimes, and compliance with the filing and tax provisions
would have exposed the defendant to liability under state law and
under the importation provision if the original importation was
illegal. Again the courts saw no fifth amendment violation.13
Second, another provision of the 1956 package required every
person addicted to or using narcotics or convicted of a violation
of the narcotics or marijuana laws punishable by over one year's
imprisonment to register upon leaving the country. 14 Designed to
aid the Government in identifying potential smugglers. the
statute was upheld, as a strict liability offense, 15 against a
multitude of constitutional challenges. 16 Since penalties for
marijuana possession almost uniformly exceeded one year's
imprisonment during this period, a first offense possession
conviction by either sovereign triggered the registration
provision. </p>

<p><b>2. Statutory Presumptions</b> </p>

<p>Because the federal statutes punished sale and possession of
marijuana only indirectly, each had to bridge the gap between
those acts and the technical crimes-tax violations and
importation-related acts. As a bootstrap from the federal taxing
power to a federal police power, Congress chose presumptions.
Thus, under the Marihuana Tax Act, possession plus failure to
produce the required forms was presumptive evidence of the
criminal act-failure to pay the tax17 -and the courts had no
trouble upholding this provision. 18 In addition, under the
Import and Export Act possession of marijuana constituted
presumptive evidence of illegal importation and of defendant's
knowledge of such importation.19 </p>

<p>Against a rash of attacks on the rationality of this
presumption, the lower federal courts20 noted that the Supreme
Court had upheld the same statutory language in the original
Federal Import and Export Act with respect to opium 21 and that
there was sufficient general knowledge that most marijuana was
imported from Mexico to make the presumption rational. Although
the Ninth Circuit at one time indicated that a defendant could
rebut the presumption by showing that the marijuana in his
possession was manicured and therefore more likely to have been
domestically grown,22 that court later held that such proof was
insufficient and that the defendant must also show actual
domestic production. 23 </p>

<p><b>B. Attacks on State Legislation</b> </p>

<p>Most attacks on the state statutes focused on the vagueness of
statutory terms-marijuana, however spelled, or cannabis or Indian
Hemp24 -both as a scientific matter and in terms of common
experience.25 Predictably, however, few state courts were of a
mind to inhibit legislative proscription of the &quot;killer
weed.&quot; Due in part to greatly exaggerated conceptions about
the effects of the drug26 and in part to the ease with which the
mature plant is processed for the outlawed purposes,27 the courts
construed these statutory definitions as broadly as possible 28
despite the traditional rule of strict construction of criminal
statutes. </p>

<p>With the progressive increase in the severity of penalties
which accompanied adoption of the Uniform Act in the 1930's and
1940's and the surge of amendments in the 1950's in the wake of
the Boggs Act.29 Some problems of application arose.
Interestingly enough. some courts, applied the lesser penalty
where one of two penalties could be imposed.30 Similarly many
courts tended to impose minimum sentences until the late 1950's
when they , too, lost all sense of proportion.31 </p>

<p><b>C. Procedural Defenses and Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>Statutory attacks during this period tended to reflect the
complicated interrelation of state and federal law and the
scientific imprecision of legislative drafting. These attacks
were usually rebuffed, and defendants, caught in a squeeze of
judicial and legislative hostility, had few, if any, viable
defenses based on whether or not they had violated the regulatory
scheme. Both state and federal statutes merely required the
prosecution to prove that the particular defendant was found in
possession of a substance which when chemically tested was found
to be marijuana. There were few tricky problems of proof, and the
prosecution usually had a clear case. If these offenders were
caught dead to rights on the merits, the energetic attorney had
to look elsewhere for his defense. </p>

<p>Fortunately, the exigencies of police practice in the field of
narcotics law enforcement provided a defendant's attorney with a
new area of attack-procedural irregularities in the arrest and
apprehension of his client. The possession and sale of marijuana
epitomize the crime without a victim; neither seller nor buyer is
apt to complain of the transaction. In order to promote vigorous
law enforcement in this area, the police have had to use a series
of undercover agents, surprise raids and often questionable
search and arrest techniques. Because of the nature of the
conduct they are trying to stifle, the police must intrude into a
private social relationship where none of the parties wants it-
thus, the police have found it essential to employ highly
secretive and often patently deceitful practices. It is no
coincidence that the vast developments in the law of criminal
procedure-especially in the fourth amendment area-have been
outgrowths primarily of narcotics and marijuana cases. </p>

<p><b>1. Search and Seizure</b> </p>

<p>Today the major remedy for an illegal search is exclusion of
the seized items as evidence. Some states and the federal courts
have used this exclusionary rule since early in the twentieth
century. However, before the 1961 decision in Mapp v. 0hio32
required all states to adopt this remedy, many state courts did
not exclude illegally seized evidence. In jurisdictions without
the rule, it scarcely helped the victim of an illegal search to
raise the point. So, for example, in a 1945 Louisiana case, the
court permitted introduction of marijuana seized without a
warrant from defendant's room while he was out of town .33 </p>

<p>Because of the scope permitted the searching officer, things
were not much better in jurisdictions adhering to the
exclusionary rule. In states using the rule before Mapp, the
crucial issue when the lawfulness of a search was questioned was
whether or not the search was reasonable under the
circumstances.34 One might expect, in view of the judicial
hostility toward marijuana defendants, that the reasonableness
standard provided sufficient leeway for circumvention of the
exclusionary rule in more than a few cases.35 Other end runs
around the rule were developed in the federal system and in the
states purporting to apply the rule to evidence seized in an
illegal search. First, courts upheld searches if there was
arguably an untainted source for seizure of the evidence. For
example, a court might admit marijuana seized in a concededly
illegal search where a police officer saw the marijuana before
beginning the illegal search .36 Second, in order to have
standing to assert the inadmissibility of seized items, one had
to admit the narcotics in question belonged to hirn.37 Third,
courts often permitted searches pursuant to a warrant to extend
far beyond the items named in the warrant 38 under what came to
be known as the contraband theory. This theory reasoned that
certain items could never lawfully be possessed and belonged only
to the government; thus any seizure of these items was
permissible.39 </p>

<p><b>2. Entrapment</b> </p>

<p>In order for federal and state agents to detect narcotics
traffic and use, it is essential that they infiltrate the drug
culture. Obtaining this inside information may often involve
police use of special employees - informers-or may require that
the police become directly involved in the commission of the
criminal act .40 Many defendants in narcotics cases have claimed
that they were forced into sales or purchases of narcotics by the
police or their agents. These charges led to the affirmative
defense of entrapment, first recognized in federal courts by the
Supreme Court in Sorrels v. United States.41 Since that time, the
principles of the defense, as stated in that decision, were
reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Sherman v. United States .42
In Sherman, a government informer induced the defendant, who was
trying to quit his use of narcotics and was undergoing treatment
at a narcotics rehabilitation center, to resume his use and
supply the informer. The Court held that the conduct of the
police informer constituted entrapment. </p>

<p>The entrapment defense would seem the ideal defense tactic in
marijuana cases, because so often the defendant has been
apprehended due to some police informer or police trick .43
However, the theoretical and practical outlines of the defense
narrowly restrict its scope and make it rarely successful.
Moreover, because it may entail an admission that defendant
committed the act charged 44 it is usually the last resort. </p>

<p>From the beginning there have been two conflicting views of
the entrapment defense. The majority view has considered
entrapment an exception to the given criminal statute on the
ground that the legislature could not have intended entrapment to
fall within the statutory definitions of the crime. With this as
the theoretical justification of the defense, the inquiry focuses
on the innocence of the defendant but for the police conduct. The
practical question is whether the police merely supplied an
opportunity for a person with a preexisting prediliction to the
criminal act. In the majority view this question of fact is to be
resolved by the jury. 45 </p>

<p>Throughout the years a substantial minority position has
contended that the entrapment defense should be considered a
police control mechanism. Under this view, the focus is on the
police and their conduct rather than on the character of the
defendant. This rationale is premised on the court's supervisory
powers over tile administration of justice, and the question of
entrapment is one of law to be decided by the not by the jury.46 </p>

<p>The focus of the defense on the character of the defendant and
the use of usually unsympathetic juries to decide the issue have
greatly hindered the successfulness of the entrapment defense.
Since the defense must be raised affirmatively, the defendant
bears a heavy burden in proving that he would not have committed
the crime but for the police inducement. Thus, in Gilmore v.
United States47 the defendant was unable to carry the burden of
proving that he would not have otherwise committed the marijuana
offense. A government agent approached the defendant and
requested marijuana, but the jury found no entrapment and the
court could not declare that there was entrapment as a matter of
law. </p>

<p>With the entrapment defense, as with illegal searches, the
court has a known lawbreaker before it and for this reason is
reluctant to free him unless there is an overwhelming reason to
dismiss the charges, As a California court stated, It is not the
entrapment of a criminal upon which the law frowns . . . . &quot;
48 The focus upon the defendant and his mental state, rather than
a focus on the government enforcement practices and their
possible effect of creating a particular crime, places an
incredible burden on the defendant to try to convince the jury
that he is otherwise blameless. The use of informers and special
agents who become friendly with those suspected of dealing in
marijuana, and the use of this friendship to try to purchase
marijuana, often by supplying the cash,49 are bound to have a
detrimental effect on the lay enforcement officers as well as to
assure a slight increase in the supply of marijuana which would
otherwise not have entered the trade. Nevertheless, the defense
as presently structured remains virtually impossible for the
defendant to raise with any real hope of success.<br>
</p>

<p><b>D. The Pro Forma Trial<br>
</b></p>

<p>When the marijuana defendant had exhausted his motions for
dismissal or suppression of the evidence and was brought to
trial, he was usually in deep trouble, faced with judicial
hostility, lax methods of identification, and loose standards of
proof. Convictions were rarely reversed for any reason and
especially not for insufficient evidence. And penalties, no
matter how harsh, were never set aside. </p>

<p>The first line of defense in the marijuana trial often
involved the defendant's claim that the substance seized from him
was not really marijuana. In general, the state had no difficulty
proving the substance to be marijuana. In the important case,
expert evidence of chemical tests may have been introduced,50 but
more commonly courts permitted the testimony of police
officers,51 undercover agents and other lay witnesses52 to be
sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury to decide.
53 Thus, when chemical evidence was not introduced, juries were
strongly inclined to believe the policeman or a disinterested
prosecution witness as against the defendant.54 </p>

<p>This ease of identification combined with the uncritical
acceptance of uncorroborated testiniony,55 produced what amounted
in fact to a very low standard of proof. Thus, in a California
case, People v. Janisse,56 the conviction was upheld on the
testimony of teenage boys, though the defendant's co-workers
testified for an alibi. The evidence of rookie police officers
who later failed their civil service exams57 has been accepted
over the word of the defendant. Finally, even the testimony of
witnesses who stand to benefit only from the conviction of the
defendant has been accepted without corroboration, whether the
benefit was indirect58 or direct.59 The wisdom of allowing such
testimony by itself to be legally sufficient for a conviction is
doubtful. </p>

<p>Although in theory the state must prove the defendant's
possession was knowing,60 through the use of circumstantial
evidence the state usually encountered few problems in meeting
its burden of proof. The state was permitted to use
circumstantial evidence to link the defendant to a quantity of
marijuana, but where only circumstantial evidence existed there
must have been an instruction to the that all other reasonable
inferences of innocence had been overcome.61 For example,
behavior such as running away from police, if marijuana was found
along the path run, was sufficient to link the defendant to
possession 62 though mere proximity without other guilty behavior
was not enough to prove possession. 63 </p>

<p>Finally, judicial hostility to the &quot;morally
depraved&quot; marijuana user was so strong that often judges
condoned inflammatory statements by the prosecution to the jury
about the nature of the drug and its users. Indeed, some judges
themselves often participated in these highly emotional
statements. For example, one judge in instructing a jury
announced: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Marijuana is a vicious, demoralizing substance that robs a
    person of morality honor, integrity, decency, and all the
    virtues that are the foundation of good character and good
    citizenship. The Government is constantly engaged in an
    effort to stamp out traffic in this and in narcotic drugs.
    Officers of the Government are employed in this effort
    usually and are entitled to credit for their loyalty and
    integrity.64<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same way, direct aspersions toward a defendant's
character were tolerated .65 For instance, courts overlooked
prosecution comments that the defendant sold his drugs near a
'junior high school&quot; or that drug use among teenagers must
be stopped .66 </p>

<p>In sum, then, defendants in marijuana cases had great
difficulties at trial during this period. Easy identification
methods, jury acceptance of uncorroborated testimony, use of
circumstantial evidence to prove defendant's possession was
knowing, and the 'judicial participation in inflammatory
statements to the jury made defense success at trial a virtual
impossibility.<br>

<p>5 With minor exceptions, the Marihuana Tax Act requires all
transactions in marijuana to be carried out by written order
form. 26 U.S.C.  4741-44 (1964). It is unlawful for a
transferor to transfer except by such form obtained by the
transferee, 26 U.S.C. S 4742 (1964), and for the transferee to
acquire, transport or conceal marijuana without filing the
transfer form, registering with the IRS and paying the applicable
transfer tax. 26 U.S.C.  4744 (a) (1964). For heretofore
unregistered persons, that tax is $100 an ounce. 26 U.S.C. 
4741 (1964). Since marijuana was excised from the United States
Pharmacopoeia, there have been few legitimate transactions by
registered persons. THE PRESIDENTS COMMISSION ON LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, REPORT: THE CHALLENGE OF CRIME IN
A FREE SOCIETY 214 (1967). Since .the tax is otherwise
prohibitive, the Act is in effect almost entirely a criminal law;
the crime is having anything to do with marijuana-possession,
sale, acquisition or importation-since proof of possession
coupled with failure, after reasonable notice and demand by the
Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, to produce the
transfer form is &quot;presumptive evidence&quot; of guilt. 26

<p>15 Application of the statute was particularly harsh. Even
though defendant, found guilty of a drug offense and sent to the
California Youth Authority for several months, had been told upon
release that his record was clean, the court held that he had
violated the statute by failing to register. Adams v. United

courts struggled mightily with arbitrariness, vagueness, right to

upheld the statute. But cf. Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d

importation was a rule of evidence, not of substantive law, the
court noted that imported marijuana was ordinarily composed of
mixed twigs and stems since the growers waited until maturity
before harvesting. In the United States, on the other hand,
growers avoided police detection by picking individual leaves
before the plant matured, Since appellant possessed mixed twigs
and stems, the court upheld application of the presumption; the
clear suggestion, however, was that the presumption would not be
applied to manicured marijuana. </p>

<p>24 Use of the Latin word &quot;cannabis&quot; was challenged
as an unconstitutionally vague definition of the prohibited
substance in People v. Oliver, 66 Cal. App. 2d 431, 152 P.2d 329
(Dist. Ct. App. 1944), on the basis of an early holding that the
use of Latin to define a sex crime was unconstitutionally vague,
Ex parte Lockett, 179 Cal. 581, 178 P. 134 (1919) (fellatio and
cunnilingus). -In rejecting the vagueness argument, the court
held that &quot;cannabis&quot; was later explained in the statute
by the use of the word &quot;marijuana&quot; and that the two
words were synonymous. See People v. Martinez, 117 Cal. App. 2d
701, 256 P.2d 1028 (Dist. Ct. App. 1953) (&quot;Indian Hemp&quot;
not unconstitutionally vague); cf. People v. Johnson, 147 Cal.
App. 2d 417, 305 P.2d 82 (Dist. Ct. App. 1957)
(&quot;lophophora&quot; not unconstitutionally vague reference to
peyote). </p>

<p>25A related issue was whether the charge of possession of
&quot;marijuana&quot; was specific enough where there were
statutory exceptions to protect the bird seed and hemp
industries. The general rule was that the state need not allege
that the parts possessed were not within the statutory
exceptions. E.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 1279 176 So. 515
(1937). Contra, People v. Sowrd, 370 111. 140, 18 N.E.2d 176
(1938'). </p>

<p>26See, e.g., Simpson v. State, 129 Fla. 127, 131, 176 So. 515,
517 (1937) (marijuana causes erotic hallucinations, loss of
sense, false conviction, loss of values, a general weakening of
powers, making it dangerous to mind and body). In Commonwealth v.
LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34, 36-37 (Fayette County Dist. Ct.
1941), the court stated: </p>

<p>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the plant which
render it highly dangerous to the mind and body, upon which it
operates to destroy the will, to produce imaginary delectable
situations, and gradually to weaken the physical powers, reside
in a sticky resin of great narcotic power that pervades the
entire plant .... 27 State v. Bonoa, 172 La. 955, 136 So. 15
(1931). </p>

<p>28 See State v. Hall, 41 Wash. 2d 446, 249 P.2d 769 (1952);
Commonwealth v. LaRosa, 42 Pa. D. &amp; C. 34 (Fayette County
Dist. Ct. 1941). LaRosa held that the statute, passed two years
earlier, created a duty to cut down marijuana plants before they
could seed and that defendant had no right to plant marijuana
even if he meant to cut the plants before maturity. Defendant's
conviction for possession of two thousand mature plants and one
hundred fifty thousand immature plants was accordingly affirmed. </p>

<p>29 See pp. 1074-75 supra. </p>

<p>30 E.g., State v. Economy, 61 Nev. 394, 130 P.2d 264 (1942). </p>

<p>31 This was particularly true in the Southwest, where use
cases were more numerous and appeals more frequent. Indicative of
this trend are the following Texas cases in chronological order:

<p>34 See, e.g., United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56 (1950).
The Court here upheld the search of a one-room office on the
grounds that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, and said
that the scope of such searches must turn on the reasonableness
of the search considering all the underlying circumstances. </p>

<p>35 Cf. Anderson v. State, 137 Tex. Crim. 461, 131 S.W.2d 961
(1939). See also Lea) v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 222, 332 S.W.2d
729 (1959), holding it reasonable for a policeman to search
defendant's shorts where he suspected from an informer's tip that
the &quot;out of the ordinary bulge&quot; in defendant's pants
concealed marijuana. </p>

<p>36 Ramirez v. State, 135 Tex. Crim. 442, 125 SW.2d 597 (1938).
Eventually, courts began to allow the admission of illegally
seized evidence if there was any untainted source whatsoever.
Thus, where defendant testified that the police had found
marijuana in a dresser drawer in his house, the court permitted
the state to introduce the marijuana based on the untainted
source of defendant's own statements in court. Rao v. State, 160
Tex. Crim, 416, 271 S.W_2d 426 (1954). </p>

<p>37 See Connolly v. Medalie, 58 F.2d 629 (2d Cir. 1932). In
that case judge Learned Hand wrote: </p>

<p>Men just wince at admitting that they were the owners, or in
possession, of contraband property; may wish at once to secure
the remedies of a possessor, and avoid the perils of the part;
but equivocation will not serve. If they come as victims, they
must take on that role, with enough detail to cast them without
question. The petitioners at bar shrank from that predicament;
but they were obliged to choose one horn of the dilemma. </p>

<p>Id. at 630 </p>

<p>38 See King v. State, 169 Tex. Crim. 34, 335 SAV.2d 378
(1959). Here the Texas court held, with one dissent, that a
search warrant for the premises of the husband authorized a
search of the wife's bag in the house; her conviction for the
materials found in the bag was affirmed, </p>

<p>In the field of search incident to an arrest, courts went even
farther. Thus, a Texas court affirmed a conviction based upon the
arrest and search of a defendant, even though the police officer
admitted he had arrested the defendant solely for the purpose of
searching him. The officer ostensibly arrested the defendant for
a knife fight, but later admitted that he had arrested him
because he suspected him of possession of marijuana. The court
noted that the defendant was unable to give any authority for his
contention that the state should be bound by the officer's
statement as to the purpose of the arrest. Gonzales v. State, 160
Tex. Crim. 548, 272 S.W.2d 524 (1954). </p>

<p>39 It had been held that contraband may be seized in a search
incident to arrest although the items taken had no relationship
to the crime for which the arrest was made. Harris v. United

defendant argued that the agents' activities were illegal, and
for that reason, the government was estopped from prosecuting him
and that the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court found
that the defendant had arranged for the deal and instructed the
jury to acquit if the agents had illegally caused the
importation. As in Gilmore, the jury was not willing to condemn

INTO THE LEGAL HISTORY OF AMERICAN MARIJUANA PROHIBITION</b> </p>

<p><b>VIII. THE PUBLIC DISCOVERS THE TRUTH ABOUT MARIJUANA</b></p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;We need not belabor the point, but sometime after 1965
the wisdom of the marijuana laws suddenly became dinner-table
conversation in most American middle-class homes along with the
Indochina war and campus dissent. Many sons and daughters, and
even mothers and fathers, of the middle class had tried the drug,
and those who had not were certainly familiar with
&quot;pot&quot; and the law. The medical profession finally
commenced a research effort to determine who was right-the user
who said the drug was a harmless pleasant euphoriant or the
lawmakers, who by their actions had condemned it as a noxious
cause of crime, addiction and insanity. <br>
</p>

<p>A. Marijuana and the Masses </p>

<p>Although marijuana arrests arid seizures hit their all-time
low point in 1960,1 the middle and late sixties witnessed a
revolution in marijuana use. Vast numbers of people have recently
adopted the drug as their principal euphoriant; however, by all
estimates, the new users are the sons and daughters of the middle
class, not the ethnic minorities and ghetto residents formerly
associated with marijuana.2 Student marijuana use is now so
common that it has been associated in the public eye with the
overall campus life style.3 Accompanying the growth of widespread
marijuana use on campus has been an increasing experimentation
with the drug by intellectuals, professors, young professionals
and members of several other social groups who would never have
considered using the drug ten years ago.4 </p>

<p>Dr. Stanley F. Yolles, former Director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, testifying before a Senate
subcommittee, said, &quot;A conservative estimate of persons in
the United States, both Juvenile and adult, who have used
marihuana, at least once, is about 8 million and may be as high
as 12 million people.&quot;5 Other estimates have run as high as
twenty to twenty-five million users.6 This vast increase in the
number of people using marijuana seems to have begun in the early
and middle sixties. It is likely that this new use pattern was
initially precipitated by the publicity surrounding the LSD
experimentation of Doctors Alpert and Leary at Harvard in 1963.7
As a growing segment of the academic fringe began to preach
consciousness-expansion, students began to find marijuana
available on campus. From that point the phenomenon snowballed.
As more novice marijuana users reported no ill effects from its
use, more students tried it, and in turn those who used and
enjoyed the drug began to &quot;turn on&quot; those who had not.
By 1970, some campuses reported that over seventy percent of the
student body were users.8 More recently, marijuana use spread
beyond the student subculture; reportedly its use has become
common even among young professionals on Wall Street.9 Moreover,
since it is readily available and widely used in Vietnam,
marijuana has become popular with many soldiers.10 </p>

<p>10 D. LOURIA, THE DRUG SCENE 10 (1968). </p>

<p>The general public is clearly aware that there has been both a
vast increase in the number of users and a shift from lower- to
middle-class use of the drug. These great changes in the nature
of marijuana use have had important social consequences. First,
with the sharp rise in the number of users and the tendency of
marijuana users to share common life styles and often political
opinions, the drug has become associated ill the past few years
with a major counter-culture, Many proponents of that
counter-culture have contended that the illegal status of
marijuana -which puts large numbers of people oil the wrong side
of the criminal law-is the most significant unifying and
recruiting agent for the New Left and the other political and
social causes of the late sixties.&quot; Some New Left leaders
have gone so far as to oppose reduction in the penalties for
marijuana possession because they feel severe penalties aid their
recruiting ends by making marijuana users outraged against a
society that overacts so strongly to a nonexistent danger.&quot;
We feel the general disrespect for marijuana laws may be causing
a dangerous disrespect for all laws in a sizeable segment of the
population. The credibility of government suffers on all issues
when its handling of the use of this drug seems to so many so far
removed from reality. This opinion is supported by the increasing
medical evidence that the dangers of tile drug are de minimus. </p>

<p>Secondly, the new middle-class use of marijuana has induced
the first significant medical inquiry into the nature of the
drug; has spawned increasing numbers of challenges to the
constitutionality of marijuana laws and penalties, and has
spurred the passage of more lenient legislation. </p>

<p>One commentator has stated: </p>

<p>Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem. Marijuana -well, it
was used by jazz musicians or the lower class, so you didn't care
if they got 2-to-20 years. But when a nice, middle-class girl or
boy in college gets busted for the same thing, then the whole
community sits up and takes notice. And that's the name of the
game today. The problem has begun to come home to roost-in all
strata of society, in suburbs, in middle-class homes, in the
colleges, suddenly, the punitive, vindictive approach was
touching- all classes of society. And now the most exciting thing
that's really happening is the change in attitude by the people.
Now we have a willingness to examine the problem, as to whether
it's an experimentation, or an illness rather than &quot;an
evil.&quot; With this change I think we can come to a more
rational approach to methods of drug control.13 </p>

<p>Without doubt, the new class of users has successfully
demanded more favorable attention from the legislatures and the
courts than the lower class could have attracted. In fact, even
the slightest circumscription of the reach of a state marijuana
law is now national news.14 </p>

<p>A third result of the widespread use of marijuana has been a
substantial challenge to the traditional picture of the national
marijuana trade. Over the past three decades, law enforcement
officials continued to convince legislators that the traffic in
marijuana was controlled by professional criminals.15 Confronted
with this portrait of the marijuana trade, legislators naturally
stereotyped the &quot;seller&quot; as the vicious criminal
pushing his wares for high profit and felt that extraordinarily
harsh penalties were justified for sellers.16 From several recent
studies it appears that the structure of marijuana traffic bears
little or no relation to the traditional stereotype. In a recent
survey of 204 users it was found that 44 percent had sold to
friends at least once. Many casual users sell to leave themselves
enough profit to cover the amount of their own use. 17 The study
further finds that even at the very top, profits are too small
and the product too bulky to interest the criminal class that
probably underwrites sales of heroin and other &quot;hard
drugs.&quot; 18 Thus even at the top, amateurs-composed generally
of the students, young professionals and soldiers who constitute
the users-are the main source of the drug.19 It is also important
to note that marijuana is typically sold by the ounce20 rather
than by the cigarette as was traditionally assumed. Thus, even
the relatively casual experimenter was likely to have at least an
ounce of the drug in his possession. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>B. Enforcement of the Marijuana Laws:
1960-1970</b></font> </p>

<p>As a result of the rapid spread of marijuana use, full
enforcement of the marijuana laws has become impossible.21 By
1967 the Federal Bureau of Narcotics had 299 agents, roughly 50
more than in 1956.22 In the same period the use of marijuana
probably increased 1,000 fold. It seems obvious from both FBN
statistics and the best available state and local statistics that
two enforcement patterns emerged in the sixties: concentration on
&quot;sellers&quot; and selective enforcement. </p>

<p>Since 1960 the FBN and major state and municipal narcotic
squads have concentrated on the larger sellers. In the early
sixties this trend was less pronounced,23 but by 1968 the
Commissioner of the FBN said that 75 percent of federal marijuana
arrests were of dealers and that even the remaining 25 percent
were sellers but were charged with possession as a result of plea
bargains. Statistics from California show the same concentration
on sellers nevertheless the California bureau found that most of
these sellers were young and first offenders.26 Thus, at least by
1968 it became clear that sellers were quite often neophytes. </p>

<p>At the same time that the police have abandoned full
enforcement for concentration on dealers, enforcement of the laws
has remained necessarily haphazard and somewhat selective. Since
marijuana use has become so common, there are certain student and
hippy communities in which the police could arrest nearly
everyone. Here the problem of selective enforcement necessarily
arises-the police arrest those they dislike for other reasons,
either political disagreement or suspicion of use of other drugs.
This inevitable practice, although perhaps not consciously
planned, has brought outcry from some victimized communities.27
This policy-if not a policy by the police at least a perception
by the hippies-of selective enforcement has provided them
increased impetus toward the anti-establishment life style they
have adopted. Their attitude is aggravated when the police engage
in particularly aggressive tactics, such as use of informers, to
trap the offenders. 28 </p>

<p>By 1970, the unenforceability of the marijuana laws was most
clearly evidenced by the failure of President Nixon's Operation
Intercept which was designed to seal off the Mexican border and
the supply of marijuana coming into the United States from
Mexico.29 Both national and international tensions led to the
failure of the &quot;Noble Experiment.&quot; By now, the
marijuana trade is so scattered and at the same time so
fragmented (with no real hierarchy in the trade) that the
unenforceability of these laws has reached Prohibition
proportions.<br>
</p>

<p><b>C. Emergence of Medical Opinion</b> </p>

<p>One of the most significant causes of widespread middle-class
use of marijuana was the lack of any medical proof of the
allegedly evil effects of its use. In fact, what authoritative
studies had been conducted up to this time were inconsistent with
the assumptions underlying anti-marijuana legislation. In this
situation, users viewed themselves as experimenters with a mild
euphoriant, not criminals endangering themselves or society at
large. The inevitable consequence was increased medical inquiry
into the effects of the drug, beginning in about 1967.31 </p>

<p>Concurrently, the National Institute of Mental Health
significantly Increased its funding for grants and contracts for
marijuana research.32 </p>

<p>Despite this intensified inquiry, uncertainty about the
effects of the drug persists. There are several major research
obstacles responsible for continued absence of reliable research.
After outlining the impediments to conclusive findings, we shall
extract from the existing studies the present state of medical
knowledge. </p>

<p><b>1. Research Obstacles</b> </p>

<p>The major obstacle is the nature of the marijuana plant
itself. Marijana is a derivative of the plant Cannabis Sativa,
commonly denoted the hemp plant. It is classified as a dioecious
plant, that is, the male reproductive parts are on one individual
plant and the female parts are on another. The differentiation of
the male and female plants is exceedingly significant because the
chemical compounds responsible for the euphoric effect of
marijuana are found primarily in the sticky resin that covers the
unfertilized female flowers and adjacent leaves. The male plant
may contain a small amount of this active resin, but it is grown
mainly for hemp fiber.33 </p>

<p>The hemp plant yields three rough grades of intoxicating
substances, the least potent of which is &quot;marijuana.&quot;
34 Yet, because the classifications are imprecise, confusion is
engendered by attributing to &quot;marijuana&quot; the effects
produced by the excessive use of the more potent forms of
cannabis.35 In addition, the psychic potency of the plant differs
depending upon where the marijuana is grown, 36 and upon
cultivation variables such as occurrence of fertilization and
time of harvesting: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If the male plants are not removed and fertilization
    occurs, the female plants which carry the main intoxicating
    properties are considerably weakened in that respect. In
    addition, unless harvesting is carried out immediately before
    the blossoming of the flowers there is further weakening and
    variation in the potency of the produce.37 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that the
marijuana used in the United States is among the weakest in the
world.38 These factors frustrate the creation of a standardized
dosage in any given experiment and preclude the comparison of the
results of independent studies.39 </p>

<p>In addition to the problems engendered by the great variance
in potency and dosage, meaningful marijuana research also
inhibited by differences in means of consumption. Since
standardized doses are generally considered impossible if the
drug is smoked,40 most studies, including the La Guardia Report,
are based upon oral administration of marijuana to the subjects.
Yet smoking is the method of consumption among nearly all
American users. Furthermore, standardized dosage is not even
assured by the oral method since &quot;little is known about the
gastrointestinal absorption of the highly water-soluble
cannabinals in man.&quot; 41 Finally, &quot;there is considerable
indirect evidence from users that the quality of the intoxication
is different when marijuana or its preparations are ingested
rather than smoked. In particular, ingestion seems to cause more
powerful effects . . . . &quot; 42 </p>

<p>2. Current Medical Knowledge </p>

<p>It is perhaps best to begin with the medical data concerning
the traditional allegations about marijuana. </p>

<p>(a) The Myths.-First, it is universally accepted among medical
authorities that marijuana is not physically habit-forming.43
Although some researchers have asserted that a psychological
dependence may result from continued use of the drug, this
hypothesis has not been established and its relevance has been
questioned. One authority has noted that &quot;habituation to
marihuana is not as strong as to tobacco or to alcohol.&quot; 44
Another has commented that &quot;[a] psychological dependence and
desire for the drug may occur, but this is inconsistent and is
not uncontrollable.... Perhaps the dependence is even less than
the dependence on cigarettes.&quot; 45 </p>

<p>Second, there is no evidence whatsoever that the use of
marijuana has a direct relationship to the commission of crime.
One commentator has noted that &quot; during the high the
marihuana user may say things he would not ordinarily say, but he
generally will not do things that are foreign to his nature. If
he is not normally a criminal, he will not commit a crime under
the influence of the drug.&quot; 46 In fact, it is entirely
likely that the characteristic passive reaction to the use of
marijuana tends to inhibit criminality. A recent study has shown
that juvenile &quot;potheads&quot; tend to be nonaggressive and
to stay away from trouble.47 Similarly, there is no scientific
evidence for the proposition that marijuana is an aphrodisiac. It
has been suggested to the contrary that the most potent form of
cannabis, pure ganja, has the reverse effect, being taken by
Indian priests to quell the libido.48 </p>

<p>Finally, the evidence is at best inconclusive regarding the
contention that use of marijuana leads to the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics. Some of the early studies claiming to
have established a valid connection were scientifically
unreliable. One authority has observed in this regard: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Supposedly scientific studies of this problem have been
    conducted in the past, such as the one done in a deprived
    area of a large city where the use of heroin was widespread,
    and indicating that many users of marijuana went on to the
    use of more hazardous drugs. I am sure that without previous
    marijuana, the use of such drugs in that environment would be
    just as high, and that if such a study were done on a college
    population, it would be found that the subsequent use of
    &quot;hard&quot; drugs would be negligible.49 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to a presidential task force investigation, another
authoritv has commented: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It is true that the Federal study showed that among heroin
    users about 50% had had experience with marijuana- the study
    also found, however, that most of the heroin addicts had been
    users of alcohol and tobacco. There is no evidence that
    marijuana is more likely than alcohol or tobacco to lead to
    the use of narcotics.50 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the basis of the available information, most authorities
have concluded that there is no scientific basis for the theory
that the use of marijuana is a causal factor in the use of
&quot;hard&quot; narcotics.51 In any event, as a matter of common
sense, it would appear that the phenomenon in dispute is very
complex, including both individual personality features and
environmental factors. As one commentator put it &quot;Several of
the studies indicate that the precious statistics have been
misleading and exaggerated.&quot; Whether or not the proposition
can be scientifically established, there is probably a slightly
greater chance that an individual who has used marijuana could go
on to opiates, but statistically this is not . . . an important
social consideration.&quot;52 </p>

<p>Thus, it appears that none of the traditional allegations
about marijuana has been scientifically established, that its
alleged addictive qualities have been disproved, and that the
overwhelming weight of authority disputes its allegedly crime
producing and stepping stone tendencies. We will now briefly
survey the medically recognized effects of the drug, physical,
psychomotor and psychological. </p>

<p>(b) Physical Effects.-The acute physical effects of marijuana
are the subject of much debate. Various studies have reached
different conclusions. Nearly all authorities, however, are in
agreement that the bodily symptoms accompanying the
&quot;high&quot; are very slight. The most commonly noted effects
are a slight rise in blood pressure, conjunctival vascular
congestion, slight elevation in blood sugar, urinary frequency
and an increase in pulse rate.53 In general, these acute symptoms
are relatively short-lived, and there are no known lasting
physical effects.54 On the other hand, there is evidence that
prolonged smoking could lead to &quot;marijuana bronchitis,&quot;
and that communal smoking has the tendency to encourage the
spread of communicable diseases. </p>

<p>(c) Psychomotor Effects.-Varying results have also been
reported in studies of the acute effects of marijuana upon
psychomotor functions. Although the researchers have sometimes
found some slight impairment in performance tests,55 there is
apparently no general depressing or stimulating effect on the
nervous system and no influence on speech and coordination.56 In
the most recent study, Doctors Well, Zinberg and Nelson of the
Boston University School of Medicine found that marijuana users
are able to compensate nearly 100 percent for whatever adverse
effects may result on ordinary psychomotor performance. 57 </p>

<p>Such findings suggest that marijuana is not likely to be a
causal factor in driving accidents, a hypothesis that is
supported by a recent simulated driving test comparing the
performance of subjects under the influence of marijuana and
alcohol.58 There seems to be no contention in the medical field
that there are any lasting effects from marijuana in the
psychomotor area. The Well study reported that noticeable effects
&quot;were diminished between 30 minutes and I hour, and they
were largely dissipated 3 hours after the end of smoking. No
delayed or persistent effects beyond 3 hours were observed or
reported.&quot; 59 </p>

<p>(d) Psychological Effects.-The acute psychological effects of
the use of marijuana are more complex. At the outset, it can be
stated with certainty that &quot;marijuana is definitely
distinguishable from other hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD, MIT,
mescaline, peyote, and psilocybin. Although it produces some of
the same effects, it is far less potent than these other drugs.
It does not alter consciousness to nearly so great an extent as
they do nor does It lead to increasing tolerance to the drug
dosage.&quot; 60 Furthermore, the subjective effects of cannabis
are dependent upon the personality of the user, his expectations,
and the circumstances under which the drug is taken, as well as
learning to smoke marijuana properly.61 </p>

<p>There is general agreement about the pleasurable psychological
effects. Users uniformly experience greatly enhanced
perception-whether real or delusory-of visual, auditory, taste
and touch effects, increased sense of humor or hilarity, feelings
of well-being or wonderment, and distorted time and space
perceptions.62 In this connection, it is interesting to note that
even the pleasurable phenomena are dependent on individual
circumstances, particularly ivlicii the drug is taken for the
first time. Many, if not most, people do not become
&quot;high&quot; on their first exposure to marijuana, even if it
is smoked correctly.63 The probable explanation for this curious
phenomenon is that repeated exposure to marijuana reduces
psychological inhibition, as part of, or as a result of, a
learning process.64 </p>

<p>Medical knowledge is most tentative with reference to adverse
psychological effects. Recent studies, however, have vehemently
disputed an earlier tendency to attribute psychoses and severe
panic reactions to marijuana use.65 As Dr. Well has noted: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Because reliable information about the acute effects of
    marijuana has been as scarce within the medical profession as
    without, many of these reactions have been misinterpreted and
    incorrectly treated. For example, simple panic states, which
    doubtless would be properly diagnosed in other circumstances,
    are often called &quot;toxic psychoses&quot; when doctors
    elicit immediate histories of marijuana use.66 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Medical experts now generally agree that the possibility of
depression, panic and psychoses depends entirely on the
circumstances of use and the personality of the user.67 In his
most recent study, Dr. Weil concluded that &quot;serious adverse
reactions are uncommon in the 'normal' population,&quot;68 but
noted three exceptions. First, simple depressive reactions which
rarely occur in regular users may occur in novices who approach
their initial use ambivalently.69 Second, the most frequent
adverse reaction is apprehension, more often described as
anxiety, and sometimes reaching a degree of panic. Again, such
reactions are closely related to the attitude of the user and to
the social setting.70 The social setting also influences the
frequency of panic reactions, suggesting again that this
phenomenon correlates with the degree of reluctance with which
people approach initial use of the drug: </p>

<p><br>
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In a community where marijuana has been accepted as a
    recreational intoxicant, they may be extremely rare (for
    example, one per cent of all responses to the drug). On the
    other hand, at a rural Southern college, where
    experimentation with the drug may represent a much greater
    degree of social deviance, 25 per cent of persons trying it
    for the first time may become panicked.71 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The panicked person normally believes that he is either dying
or losing his mind, and simple reassurance will end most such
reactions.72 The reaction normally is short-lived, but it may be
prolonged by an attitude encouraging the underlying fears.73 In
short, &quot;panic reactions . . . seem more nonpharmacologic
than pharmacologic.&quot;74 </p>

<p>Third, psychotic reactions occur rarely, if at all, in normal
users,75 and occur mainly in persons with a low psychosis
threshold or a history of psychosis76 or hallucinogenic drug
experimentation.77 Even in such cases, marijuana is a precipitant
rather than a primary cause of this type of reaction 78 which
lasts at most a day or two.79 <br>

<p>31 At the end of 1968 there existed only four known studies on
human subjects conducted by Americans. See Weil, Zinberg &amp;
Nelson, Clinical and Psychological Effects of Marihuana in Man,
162 SCIENCE 1234, 1235 (1968) [hereinafater cited as Weil Study].
The previous lack of concern with marijuana call also be observed
by 211 examination of the number of articles appearing in medical
periodicals. During the decade between 1942 and 1951, only six
articles dealing with the subject are listed in the index for
medical journals. Eleven reports were noted as being published in
the next ten years. From 1962 to 1966, an average of three
materials per year were available. It was not until 1967 that the
subject became of sufficient interest to occupy the time of a
reasonable number of medical authors. In that year, eleven
articles appeared in medical periodicals. By 1968, this number
had increased to 30, and in 1969 more than 60 articles dealing
with the topic of human marijuana consumption have appeared. In
other words, more than three times the number of articles
appeared in the last three years than in the 25 preceding years. </p>

<p>32 In Fiscal year 1967, NIMH obligated $786,000 for marihuana
research grants and contracts. Comparable figures for 1968 and
1969 respectively were S1,239,000 and $1,330,000. In Fiscal year
1970, if funds are available, the institute proposes to obligate
$2,550,000 to support grant and contract studies of marihuana,
which means that there will have been a more than three-fold
increase for support of these studies in the last four
years.&quot; Statement by Dr. Roger 0. Egcberg, Assistant

<p>33 Weil Study 1234. </p>

<p>34 The three substances are charas-pure unadulterated resin
that has been scraped from the leaves and flowering tops of the
female plant; hashish or ganja-an agglomeration of female
flowering tops and stems with whatever resin is attached to their
surfaces, thought to contain about 40% resin; and marijuana-a low
potency preparation consisting of dried mature leaves and
flowering tops of both male and female plants, thought to contain
between 5 and 8% resin. Schwarz, Toward a Medical Understanding
of Marihuana, 14 CAN. PSYCHIATRIC ASS'N J. 591, 592 (1969). </p>

<p>35 As long as the term marihuana is used indiscriminately to
refer to cannabis of all kinds and potencies, confusion will
continue. . . . In this country some of the vigorous opponents of
marihuana seem to foster this confusion by attributing to any use
of marihuana the effects produced primarily by the excessive use
of the more potent forms of cannabis in an attempt to preserve a
strongly negative public image of marihuana. </p>

<p>H. NOWLIS, DRUGS ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS 93 (1969). </p>

<p>36 &quot;The major botanical feature of the plant is the
extreme variability in its appearance, characteristics and
properties when grown in different geographical and climatic
condition.&quot; Schwarz, supra note 34, at 591. In the United
States and Mexico, for example, the production of the more potent
forms is relatively uncommon, and there appears to be no demand
for them. J. ROSEVEAR, POT: A HANDBOOK OF MARIHUANA 31-33 (1967).
</p>

<p>37 Schwarz, supra note 34, at 592. </p>

<p>38 Zunin, Marijuana: The Drug and the Problem, 134 MILITARY
MED. 104, M. 7 (1969). According to the author, several factors
contribute to this phenomenal: (1) The amount of resin found in
the flowering tops markedly decreases as the plants are grown in
more temperate areas. It is estimated that the resin content of
Indian cannabis is 20%; Mexican 15% or less; that grown in
Kentucky 8%; and that found in Wisconsin 6% or less. </p>

<p>(2) The activity of the resin in the female is greatly reduced
if fertilized by the male. In this country, because of an
inability to distinguish between the two plants, inattention to
cultivation and lack of knowledge, the female plants are
fertilized. (3) The resinous content is highest prior to
&quot;going to seed&quot; of the female plant. The marijuana in
this country has gone to seed prior to harvesting. </p>

<p>(4) The male plant contains little or no resin content. In
this country, the male plant is indiscriminately mixed with the
female plant in the final preparation. </p>

<p>(5) The most active portion of the plant is the flowering top.
In this country, preparations of marijuana are composed primarily
of leaves, twigs, and seeds which are crushed. </p>

<p>(6) The potency of marijuana decreases with time. It is
reduced at the end of one year, markedly reduced at the end of
two years, and nonexistent at the end of three years. In
addition, it keeps better in cold, dry climates. Most of the
marijuana in the United States is several months to several years
old by the time it has been harvested and has passed through the
smuggling operation. </p>

<p>39 Given the above variations in the plant and in its products
and extracts, together with the continuing ignorance of its
chemistry it is not surprising that it is virtually impossible to
make direct comparisons between the various studies on the
effects on human beings who are even more individually variable. </p>

<p>Schwarz, supra note 34, at 593. </p>

<p>Recently. what is believed to be the active ingredient in
marijuana has been isolated and synthesized. However, this
substance denominated (THC), is only available for research in
very limited quantities. Weil Study Furthermore, it has not been
proven that THC is the sole ingredient contributing to the
effects caused by marijuana. </p>

giving marihuana by smoking because, they sav, the dose cannot he

<p>43 &quot;-There is now an abundance of evidence that marihuana
is not an addictive drug. Cessation of its use produces no

stimuli. Grinspoon, supra note 43, at 20. &quot;The drug did
affect steadiness of the hand and body and the reaction time for
complex stimuli.&quot; Id. The most recent study in this area was
done by Andrew Weil, Norman Zinberg and Judith Nelson of the

regular users of marijuana may show some slight degree of
impairment in performance tests, but that the aptitude of the
subjects may even improve slightly after smoking marijuana. Weil

</p>

<p>IX. MARIJUANA LEGISLATION CLASHES WITH JUDICIAL SKEPTICISM AND
EMERGING VALUES - PIECEMEAL JUDICIAL RESPONSE: 1965-1970<br>
</p>

<p>The dramatic increase in marijuana use during the latter
1960's and the consequent increase in prosecution1 were matters
of high public visibility. Judicial response at both the trial
and appellate levels was influenced by a combination of powerful
forces, none of which had been present in the preceding years.
The 1960's saw a revolution in the law of criminal procedure, and
in few areas were police practices more suspect than in the
enforcement of the drug laws. The latter part of the decade
witnessed widespread dissent against the political and legal
systems; this protest milieu gave an added dimension to marijuana
use as more and more people smoked, oftentimes overtly, in order
to defy a seemingly ignorant law. Faced with this unusual
conjunction of widespread political and social eccentricity, the
courts-institutional protectors of political deviants-were
inevitably pressed into institutional sympathy for social
deviants. A third force was the revitalized judicial interest in
the value of privacy in a highly automated, technological
society; more and more people went to the courts to question
longstanding governmental prohibitions against essentially
private decisions and acts-homosexuality, abortion, contraception
and drugs. Together with the well-publicized medical skepticism
about the soundness of the nation's drug laws, particularly those
regulating marijuana, these forces moved the courts to scrutinize
enforcement practices and consider a new wave of constitutional
objections to state and federal marijuana legislation.<br>
</p>

<h2>A. Multiple Offenses: Untying the Statutory Knots</h2>

<h3>1. Federal Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>In the major decision during this period, the United States
Supreme Court voided the federal provisions most often employed
to prosecute the possessor (buyer) of marijuana. In the first arm
of Leary v. United States,2 the Court held that the Fifth
Amendment relieves unregistered buyers of any duty to pay the
transfer tax and to file the written order form as required by
the Marihuana Tax Act.3 The Court reasoned that, since filing
such a form would expose a buyer to liability under state law,
under the occupational tax provisions of the Tax Act, and perhaps
under the marijuana provision of the Import and Export Act,4 the
filing provisions violated the fifth amendment guarantees against
self-incrimination. On the other hand, the Court held in a later
case that the fifth amendment does not relieve the marijuana
seller of the duty to confine his sales to transferees who are
willing to comply with the order form requirements.5 Similarly,
the Eighth Circuit recently held6 that Leary does not compel
invalidation of Tax Act section 4755(b), which prohibits the
interstate transportation of marijuana, because a conviction
under that section is not really a conviction for falling to
register and pay the occupational tax and, even if it were,
registration under section 4753 is not necessarily incriminating
as was the written order form requirement struck down in Leary .7
</p>

<p>The second arm of Leary reversed the long line of decisions8
upholding the presumption of knowing concealment of illegal
importation arising from possession under section 176a of the
Import and Export Act.9 The Court held that, in light of the case
with which marijuana was domestically cultivated and the number
of users, the presumption of know1edge could not rationally be
drawn from possession.10 it could not be said &quot;with
substantial assurance that the presumed fact [knowing concealment
of illegally imported marijuana] is more likely than not to flow
from the proved fact [possession] on which it is made to
depend.&quot;11 Although there is authority to the contrary,12
the Ninth Circuit has held this part of Leary retroactive,
thereby invalidating all prior Section 176a convictions in which
the defendant did not admit knowledge and the was instructed as
to the applicability of the statutory presumption .13 </p>

<p>A serious dispute remains as to what the Government will have
to prove in subsequent prosecutions under section 176a. Assuming
that the entire provision does not violate the privilege against
self-incrimination,14 it is likely that the prosecution will have
to prove actual knowledge of illegal importation in the future.15
Since it is highly improbable that such proof will be
forthcoming, section 176a has probably been rendered useless as
applied to possessors. It should be clear that the entire series
of decisions under the Tax Act and section 176a has an air of
unreality about them because Congress probably has Article I
power directly to prohibit possession and sale of marijuana and
has now exercised that power in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970.16 This new legislation,
although stopping short in some respects, discards many of the
fictions perpetuated by earlier legislation. The Leary decision
was at least partially responsible for forcing Congress to
rationalize the federal role in the drug field, particularly with
respect to marijuana. </p>

<p>Another manifestation of judicial dissatisfaction with the
extreme nature of existing drug legislation is the apparent
reversal of the trend of decisions upholding the strict liability
of one-time drug offenders, users and addicts for failure to
register when leaving the country.17 The Ninth Circuit held the
phrase &quot;uses narcotic drugs&quot; unconstitutionally
vague.18 Taking a more direct approach, the Second Circuit found
knowledge of the registration requirement to be an element of the
crime.19 Thus construed, the statute precludes any due process
challenge to the sufficiency of the notice.20 Although a
self-incrimination issue remains, 21 the Second Circuit's
decision removed the most serious defect in the statute, one that
had become intolerable as the number of marijuana convictions
escalated in the late 1960's.<br>
</p>

<h3>2. State Developments<br>
</h3>

<p>The erosion of the archaic federal criminal statutes for
marijuana-related offenses has been accompanied by a similar,
albeit limited, development on the state level. The major issue
in state litigation concerns so-called &quot;drug-proximity&quot;
offenses which are generally employed as plea-bargaining tools or
to prevent the release of a suspect when evidence was 1 illegally
seized or when the evidence is insufficient to secure a
conviction under the substantive drug offense. Typical ancillary
offenses are loitering in the common areas of a building for the
purpose of unlawfully using or possessing any narcotic drug;22
loitering in public by a user, addict or convicted drug offender
without lawful employment;23 presence in an establishment where
narcotic drugs are dispensed;24 and presence of a user or drug
offender in a private place where drugs are kept.25 </p>

<p>The decisional trend seems to point to the unconstitutional
vagueness of simple loitering and vagrancy statutes.26 Because of
the nexus between narcotics and crime, however, the courts are
struggling to redefine narcotics-proximity statutes to avoid the
vagueness objection.27 It might appear that where &quot;good
account&quot; provisions give the arresting police officer too
much discretion the statute will fal1.28 On the other hand,
courts generally avoid vagueness objections based on lack of
notice by reading in knowledge elements wherever neccssary.29
Because of the tenuous relation between marijuana and crime, the
courts should construe &quot;narcotics&quot; in such statutes not
to include marijuana. </p>

<p>Similar restriction of marijuana-related offenses has been
accomplished by holding that charges of possession and sale will
not both lie where the only possession is incident to sale,30 and
by tightening the requirements of specificity in the indictment
regarding the proscribed parts of the plant.31 </p>

<h2>B. Procedural Objections to Enforcement Practices<br>
</h2>

<p>The law of criminal procedure underwent a major revolution in
the 1960's. The Bill of Rights was applied piece by piece to the
states through the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court
focused its concern on protecting the rights of the criminal
defendant. The earlier philosophy had been that, so long as the
defendant's rights at trial were guaranteed, the Court should
not, and did not need to, intrude into the pretrial stages of the
criminal process. For a variety of reasons it became clear in the
1960's that in a system where between 75 and 90 percent of all
defendants bargain and enter guilty pleas, rights must be assured
well before trial if they are to have any real meaning to the
average person caught in the net of the criminal process. Thus,
step by step the Court began to regulate police practices-search,
arrest and interrogation techniques-and the conduct of the early
stages of the criminal process. This substantial change in
attitude meant that more marijuana defendants could successfully
raise procedural objections.<br>
</p>

<h3>1. Search and Seizure<br>
</h3>

<p>The most important development for the marijuana offender has
been the close judicial scrutiny of police searches as a result
of Supreme Court rulings under the fourth amendment. More
stringent standards have been established for the police to
obtain search warrants32 and the proper scope of searches
incident to a lawful arrest has been narrowed substantially. 33 </p>

<p>Although courts have refused to exclude any evidence that was
in plain sight when seized, such as a bag of marijuana in a
school satchel voluntarily opened by a student,34 or marijuana
thrown out of window by a defendant trying to dispose of it,35
they have narrowed the permissible time and area in which a car
may be searched .36 </p>

<p>Moreover, the difficult standing problem posed by the
requirement that one had to admit possession or ownership of the
seized property in order successfully to challenge the search was
alleviated in cases involving group arrests by permitting all
those on the premises to challenge a given search.37 </p>

<p>The new requirements for procuring search warrants led to a
number of technical defense victories. For example, searches of
defendants' residences were successfully challenged in two
Montana marijuana cases38 because the warrants were issued by a
justice of the peace, rather than by a district judge, as
required by the state law. These holdings were premised on the
sanctity of private residences, and they suggest a growing
reluctance to countenance &quot;reasonable&quot; warrantless
searches, especially of the home. Similarly, Maryland struck down
the fruits of a search of defendant's guests and their
automobiles on the ground that the permissible search was limited
to the areas described in the warrant.39 An Illinois court has
held that property not included in the warrant must be returned
to the defendant.40 This return to a more stringent view of
particularity requirements of warrants stands in stark contrast
to the willingness of courts to overlook these requirements in
the late fifties.41 </p>

<p>Likewise, courts now scrutinize more closely police claims of
probable cause for expanding the area of the search. A California
court held that even though defendant was lawfully arrested,
search of his luggage in a friend's apartment was justified
neither by the friend's consent nor by the officer's having seen
the defendant swallow something.42 The search was especially
unjustifiable since the defendant had been arrested in his
automobile. In another California case, the presence of peculiar
odors did not constitute probable cause for the search of a
footlocker.43 </p>

<p>An airline had detained the footlocker since it corresponded
to a police description. The officers had smelled the marijuana
and then searched the footlocker before sending it on its way and
tracing it. The California Supreme Court held that the smell
alone was not sufficient cause to search without a warrant. </p>

<p>Despite judicial narrowing of the scope of searches with or
without a warrant, the easing of the standing requirements, and
the closer scrutiny on the probable cause issue, courts continue
to permit police to enter dwellings without knocking or by force
where circumstances indicate such action is reasonable and
necessary. For example, a California court upheld a marijuana
search, even though the police entered without knocking, because
the police heard people running around inside yelling, &quot;It's
the police,&quot; and thought they heard a shot fired.44 The
court held that the statutory knocking requirement was subject to
exception when there was danger of destruction of evidence and
danger to the police. Closely related to no-knock entry is
forcible entry, upheld in an Illinois case45 where the police
broke into the defendant's residence when he did not immediately
respond to their knocks. The necessity for forced entry is
essentially the same as for unannounced entry, but forced entry
adds the danger of causing fright and damage. </p>

<p>Another search area that has not been substantially
liberalized is that of the border search. Customs officials have
a much more extensive right to search than their police
colleagues. Mere suspicion is sufficient to justify a border
search.46 Even though the jurisdiction of customs agents ends
once entry into the country is completed,, the courts have
allowed border guards great discretion in determining what
constitutes completed entry. In Thomas v. United States.47 the
Fifth Circuit held admissible evidence seized an hour and a half
after the appellant had entered the United States because he was
only six blocks from the border. Although there is an inevitable
problem of how far the jurisdiction of the customs agent extends,
Thomas suggests c1early that it is not limited to border
crossings. <br>
</p>

<h3>2. Entrapment</h3>

<p>Although the majority opinions in Sorrells v. United States48
and Sherman v. United States,49 remain the leading statements on
entrapment, some courts have recently permitted expansion of the
defense. In California a defendant may plead not guilty and still
raise the entrapment defense in some cases. The court in People
v. Perez stated: </p>

<p>To compel a defendant to admit his guilt as a condition of
invoking the defense of entrapment would compel him to relieve
the prosecution of its burden of proving his guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt at the risk of not being able to meet his burden
of proving entrapment.50 </p>

<p>The defendant must, however, still raise the defense at trial
to be determined as a matter of fact by the jury.51 There is no
right to raise the defense in a pretrial motion to suppress the
evidence.52 Most courts continue to focus on the moral
culpability of the accused53 in determining whether or not
entrapment has been successfully shown. Recent Arkansas,54 and
Nevada55 cases, however, suggest that the courts are increasingly
concerned about the conduct of law enforcement agents, especially
in marijuana cases.<br>
</p>

<h3>3. Other Prosecution Practices</h3>

<p>Several major abuses, although judicially recognized, remain
largely uncorrected. Long delay between offense and arrest is
common in narcotics offenses because the police desire to expose
the full extent of distribution and to maintain a cover for the
undercover agent as long as possible. Yet any substantial delay
prejudices the defendant since the prosecution continues to
gather evidence while the defendant may forget exact
circumstances and possibly exculpating facts. Judicial response
has been inconsistent, focusing primarily on the purposefulness
of the delay.56 In light of the recent rejuvenation of the speedy
trial requirement by the Supreme Court,57 there is some hope that
this abuse may be corrected. </p>

<p>A more serious abuse with which state and federal prosecutors
have been charged is politically-motivated discretionary
enforcement.58 Although the courts can do little to remedy this
state of affairs, it forms the basis for one of our basic
contentions: The political-social overtones of the marijuana
problem may inhibit a rational political and prosecutorial
response and at the same time may provoke a protective judicial
response. One judge, particularly expert with regard to
contemporary drug problems acknowledged the partial truth of the
charges of political prosecution against Hippies, long-hairs and
draft-card burning college students.59 To the extent that other
trial and appellate Judges recognize these prosecutorial
tendencies, we can expect some judicial compensation either in
fact-finding, in sentencing, or in response to substantive
challenges to the law. It is our contention, of course, that such
judicial reaction has already begun.<br>
</p>

<h3>C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</h3>

<p>The ease of identifying marijuana in conjunction with the use
of uncorroborated testimony and circumstantial evidence continues
to require of the prosecution only a very low burden of proof.
Nevertheless, appellate decisions are gradually beginning to
tighten these requirements, and active judicial hostility at
trial has all but disappeared. </p>

<p>Although the use of uncorroborated testimony to convict
continues to be upheld by the courts,60 an Illinois appellate
court has reversed a conviction because of the behavior of the
testifying officer.61 Noting that the officer had repeatedly
pressured the defendant to become an informer, the court held
that the uncorroborated testimony of this officer was not
sufficient to support a conviction. The court did not make clear
whether it exercised a weight of the evidence review of the trial
judge's fact-finding, or whether it applied an exclusionary
evidence rule pursuant to its inherent powers over the
administration of criminal justice. Whatever the case, judicial
perspective in the clash between marijuana defendant and police
officer has clearly shifted. </p>

<p>The amount of marijuana required to uphold a conviction is
undergoing substantial change. The California Supreme Court held
in People, v. Leal62 that to be sufficient for conviction, the
amount of narcotics must be enough for sale or consumption, the
rule generally applied where the statute does not specify a
minimum quantity.63 In Eckroth v. State64 a Florida court ruled
that the taking of a drug from a passing pipe is not sufficient
to constitute possession where the defendant did not own the
pipe, the drug or the premises. Similarly, in a case that
received national publicity,65 the Minnesota Supreme Court field
that if the state defines marijuana as a narcotic, it cannot
punish possession of what could be native cannabis in amounts too
scanty to produce a &quot;narcotic&quot; effect. Accordingly,
exiguous traces of the drug found in the crevices of defendant's
brief case left in his mistress' car did not constitute an amount
sufficient for conviction .66 </p>

<p>Other problems remain unsolved. Circumstantial evidence
continues to link defendants to seized marijuana. Constructive
possession was found where the defendant's daughter was the
actual possessor67 and the fact that marijuana was found where an
informer said she had seen defendant smoking it the previous day
was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction.68 There is
a split as to whether a conviction can be upheld where the
defendant gratuitously brings the buyer and seller together.
Massachusetts upheld the conviction for possession where the
defendant's only contact with the marijuana was passing it to the
state's agent,69 ruling that the facilitation of the sale added
enough to the act of passing to allow the court to find
possession. In a similar case, however, a New York court held
that there was not present the required involvement or concert of
action to uphold a conviction for sale.70 Nevertheless, courts
have refused conviction on numerous occasions in which the
defendant was not linked exclusively with the marijuana that was
found71 and have generally required an outside linking factor
before upholding the possession.72 However, the element that can
tip the scales in favor of conviction is often unrelated to the
possible possession of the marijuana. For example, a California
court73 upheld the finding of possession of marijuana discovered
along with a purse the defendants had stolen. The defendants
contended that the marijuana was not theirs and must have been in
the purse when stolen. That the defendants were thieves probably
played more heavily in the conviction than any evidence of their
connection with marijuana. </p>

<p>Where marijuana is found on the premises of the individual,
possession is presumed, although the courts have read in a
defense of ignorance of the presence of the marijuana.74
Nevertheless, in a New Hampshire case75 the court upheld a
possession conviction premised on the defendant's knowledge of
presence of the drug on the premises even though the court
apparently believed the defendant's story that it belonged to a
third party. Ordinarily there is direct corroborating evidence to
indicate the defendant's knowledge.76 </p>

<p>Along with the gradual thaw on these points in state courts,
the late sixties witnessed a total absence of the outrageous
judicial participation in inflammatory statements about the
dangers of the drug and its users which we saw was typical of the
late fifties. To the contrary, the appellate opinions, at least,
are replete with skeptical references to the inclusion of
marijuana in the narcotics classification .77<br>
</p>

<h3>D. Sanction</h3>

<p>Nowhere has judicial disenchantment with the drug laws,
especially marijuana, been greater than in the area of
punishment. Preference for civil treatment of drug abuse,78
disgust with severe mandatory sentencing that deprives the
Judiciary of its traditional function of weighing the culpability
of the individual offender, 79 and skepticism about a statutory
scheme which catches the user or small scale distributor and
misses the major trafficker80 have all found their way into
judicial opinions. </p>

<p>This dissatisfaction with legislative inaction in the area of
de-escalating punishment has already begun to provoke remedial81
judicial action. In a landmark decision82 receiving national
attention,83 the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently held that
any prison sentence imposed for first-offense possession of
marijuana for personal use &quot;should be suspended,&quot;84
While the court based its holding on the judiciary's statutory
authority to suspend sentences in &quot;the best interests of the
public as well as of the defendant,&quot;85 and on the appellate
court's power to review for abuse of discretion trial court
sentencing decisions, it appears that the true locus of the
opinion is the Eighth Amendment. That is, the court really
determined that any prison sentence for first-offense possession
of marijuana for personal use is unreasonably excessive.
Accordingly, the decision will be discussed in more detail in the
following section.86<br>

the &quot;illegal importation&quot; presumption. Id at 38. The

irrational as applied to cocaine. It has been held that Turner is

<p>13 United States v. Scott, 425 F.2d 55 (9th Cit. 1970). We
think the Ninth Circuit is right, at least with respect to
convictions secured after marijuana achieved high public
visibility in the 1960's. Since the number of people still
incarcerated for earlier convictions is minimal, complete
retroactive effect is in order. Essential to the Leary decision
was a determination that the presumption was factually
unsupportable; it therefore constituted a material flaw in the
fact-finding process and seriously impaired the right to jury
trial. </p>

<p>14 Absent the written order form requirement of the Marihuana
Tax Act, we do not see how prosecution under  176a involves the
fifth amendment at all. Neither did the Ninth Circuit. Id. at 61.

mere inference of importation is clearly not enough to sustain a
conviction since it would nullify Leary. Cf. United States v.
Ramos, 282 F. Supp. 354 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (where Government failed
to prove possession beyond reasonable doubt, court could not
infer knowledge of importation). It is difficult to see how the
Government could raise an inference of knowledge without proving
actual knowledge. If, however, such can be done, it is clear that
the defendant has a right to prove that the marijuana was not
imported. United States v. Espinoza, 406 F.2d 733 (2d Cir.),

possessing any narcotic drug.&quot; The court distinguished the
ordinary vagrancy and loitering cases on the ground that the
conduct punished in the narcotics vagrancy statute is directly
related to the commission of crime against others: </p>

<p>[P] rotection of innocent citizens from drug users is a very
crucial problem. As has recently been pointed out by several
newspaper articles, in some of our poorer urban areas where drug
use is high, innocent citizens are often beaten, robbed and even
murdered by drug addicts .... It is completely reasonable and
proper for the Legislature to protect these citizens from
accidentally stumbling into the midst of such miscreants in the
common areas of buildings. </p>

<p>47 372 F.2d 252 (5th Cir. 1967). The customs agents had
searched the defendants belongings at the time he had entered the
country arid had not discovered the marihuana and heroin he
possessed. They came into town and searched the defendant when
they were notified by an informer that he was carrying the
contraband. </p>

<p>6062 Cal. 2d 769, 776, 401 P.2d 934, 938, 44 Cal. Rptr. 326,
330 (1965). The decision overturned a long series of precedents.
That all justices concurred is indicative of the sentiment for
change. The court required the prosecution to disclose the
identity of the informant because he was essential to the
defenses of entrapment and lack of knowledge. The decision was
immediately implemented in People v. Marsden, 234 Cal. App. 2d
796, 44 Cal. Rptr. 728 (Dist. Ct. App. 1965). There, defendant
was repeatedly requested to furnish marijuana to a government
agent and finally purchased and gave the agent one marijuana
cigarette. The court noted that the case was close to entrapment
as a matter of law. </p>

defendant gave some marijuana free of charge to the agent after
repeated requests. The marijuana had been left in the defendant's
shop by others. In remanding the case for consideration by the
jury whether entrapment existed the court stated: </p>

<p>Perhaps, neither the persistent solicitation, the use of an
alias, the misrepresentation of the purposes for which [the
agent] wanted to acquire the marijuana nor the use of friends of
appellant for an entree, standing alone, would have been
sufficient to raise a fact question as to entrapment, but when
taken together along with the total lack of evidence that [the
defendant] had possessed or sold marijuana before, there was such
an issue. Id. at 278. </p>

Franklin v. State, 8 Ind. App. 134, 258 A.2d 767 (1969) (heroin),
in which the court upheld a conviction for possession where the
defendant went to the hospital with an overdose. Although
recognizing that once the drug is inside the body there is no
possession because there is no control, the court felt that prior
possession and self-administration could be inferred. The
decision should do much to discourage addicts from receiving any
medical treatment that might expose them to criminal penalties. </p>

(E.D.N.Y. 1969) (Weinstein, J.); Oliver, supra note 59, at 230: </p>

<p>In most other areas of the law, however, legislatures have
freely granted judges the power and discretion within quite
flexible limitations, to determine appropriate sentences for all
particular defendants before them that may or may not, dependent
upon the particular case, include commitment to a penal
institution. . . . </p>

<p>In the field of drug abuse, quite contrary to that experience,
mandatory prison sentences apparently reflect a legislative
conviction that all drug offenders are so alike that sending all
to prison is, in fact, a real solution to what must have been
viewed as a relatively simple problem. They also seem to reflect
a certainty and righteousness that can hardly be said to be
justified by our present scientific knowledge. </p>

<p>80 For example, in Aguilar v. United States, 363 F. 2d 379 (9<sup>th</sup>
Cir. 1966), the court affirming the smuggling conviction of a
Mexican mechanic driving a car containing marijuana back to the
United States, noted: </p>

<p>Here was a young man with a previous clean record, and there
was no indication he was a user of narcotics or inside a
narcotics ring. Apparently he was a victim of his personal
economics. When the law gets no closer than this to the real
rascal, one must wonder about the policy of it, although it be
beyond our function. </p>

<p>Id. at 381. See also Oliver, supra note 59, at 233 </p>

<p>81 What Justice Jackson said about adjudicative mood when the
death penalty hangs in the balance is equally appropriate with
regard to harsh marijuana penalties: </p>

<p>When the penalty is death, we, like state judges, are tempted
to strain the evidence and even, in close cases, the law in order
to give a doubtfully condemned man another chance. </p>

Illicit Drugs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Opium smoking is outlawed</strong></font></p>

<p>To summarize the data reviewed so far, opiates taken daily in
large doses by addicts were not a social menace under
nineteenth-century conditions, and were not perceived as a
menace. Opium, morphine, and heroin could be legally purchased
without a prescription, and there was little demand for opiate
prohibition. But there was one exception to this general
tolerance of the opiates. In 1875, the City of San Francisco
adopted an ordinance prohibiting the smoking of opium in
smoldng-houses or &quot;dens.&quot; 1</p>

<p>The roots of this ordinance were racist rather than
health-oriented, and were concerned with what today is known as
'1ife-style.&quot; Opium smoking was introduced into the United
States by tens of thousands of Chinese men and boys imported
during the l850s and 1880s to build the great Western railroads.*
The Chinese laborers then drifted into San Francisco and other
cities, and accepted employment of various kinds at low wages
-giving rise to waves of anti-Chinese hostility. Soon white men
and even women were smoking opium side by side with the Chinese,
a life-style which was widely disapproved. The San Francisco
authorities, we are told learned upon investigation that
&quot;many women and young girls, as well as young men of
respectable family, were being induced to visit the [Chinese]
opium-smoking dens, where they were ruined morally and otherwise
* The 1875 ordinance followed, &quot;forbidding the practice
under penalty of a heavy fine or imprisonment or both. Many
arrests were made, and the punishment was prompt and thorough.- 6</p>

<hr>

<p>* Professor Jonathan Spence of the Department of History, Yale
University, presented a fascinating account of opium smoking in
nineteenth-contury China at the Conforence on Local Control and
Social Protest during the Ch'ing Period, hold at Honolulu,
Hawaii, from June 27 to July a, 1971. He reported, for example,
that &quot;opium was highly regarded in China, both as a
medicinal drug (that checked diarrhea and sorved as a febrifuge),
and as an aphrodisiac. Therefore people might become addicted
eithor becawe they took opium intensively during an illness hr
instanco in the great cholera epidemic of 1821-or bocause they
had vigor, leisure and money and wanted to make the best of it.</p>

<p>'Those who who ate regularly and well did not suffer
physiologically from their addiction, but for the poor, addiction
was a serious health hazard (even though, ironically, it was
often first taken for health reasons), since scarce cash
resources were put to opium rather than food purchases. The
rewards for the poor were a blurring of the pains of prolonged
labor, and an increase in work capacity over short periods of
time. Then there was heavy addiction among coolies and
chair-bearers, and among such groups as boatmen who had to work
their boats upstream, and stone-cutters working out-of-doors in
cold weather. The last Chinese to become addicted seem to have
been the peasants, though as they grew moro opium crops the
incidenceof heavy opium anoking rose, and by 1902 one could find
entire rural communities that were in desperate straits because
addiction had become almost total. By the late Ch'ing, it scans
that no major occupational group was without its addicts.&quot;5 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>~* One white girl of good family and education began opium
smoking at sixteen in San Francisco in 1880, later became a
prostitute, moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and was found in
an opium den in 1884 by a Royal Comnmission. The transcript of
her answers to questions reads, in part:</p>

<p>Q. Why did you commence to smoke opium?</p>

<p>A. Why do people commence to drink? Trouble, I suppose led me
to smoke. I think it is better than drink. People who smoke opium
do not kick up rows; they injure no one but themselves, and I do
not thinlc they injure themselves very much.</p>

<p>Q.... Why do you smoke now?</p>

<p>A. Bocause I must; I oould not live without it. I smoke partly
because of the quiet enjoyment it gives, but mainly to escape
from the horrors which would ensue if I not smoke. To be
twenty-four hours without smoking is to suffer worse tortures
than the lost.</p>

<p>Q. But does not the smoking make you wretched, past as
drinking would?</p>

<p>A. No; I require about twelve pipes, then I fall into a state
of somnolence and complete rest. When I awake I feel all right,
and can attend to fixing-up the house. I am brisk, and can work
as well as anybody else. I do not feel sick or nervous, neither
have I the inclination to smoke more opium.</p>

<p>O. Then why do you return to the use of the drug?</p>

<p>A. Ah! that's it; there is a time when my hands fail me; tears
fall from my eyes, I am ready to sink; then I come here and for a
few bits have a smoke which sets me right. There is too much
nonsense talked about opium-smoking. Life without it would be
unendurable, I am in excellent health; but, I suppose, every one
has their own troubles, and I have mine.</p>

<p>Q. I do not want to be offensive, but are you what is called a
fast woman?</p>

<p>A. I am. But you would be greatly mistaken if you inagined
that all the women wbo oome here to smoke are of that character.
In San Francisco I have known some of the first people visit
opium houses, and many respectable people do the same here.</p>

<p>Q. Are women of your class generaIly addicted to
opium-smoking? </p>

<p>A. No; they are more addicted to drink, and drink does them
far more harm. Drink excites passions, whereas this allays it;
and when a fast woman drinks she goes to min pretty quick....</p>

<p>Q. Have you anything else to add . . . ?</p>

<p>A. No; I would say this, though: that if opium houses were
licensed as drinking saloons are one need not have to come into
such holes as this to smoke. There would be nice rooms with nice
couches, and the degradation would be mitigated. At all events I
think the government that will not license an opium saloon should
shut up public houses and hotels where they sell vitriol for
wbiskey and brandy, and where men idle themselves with a
certainty and a rapidity beyond the power of opium.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>This first law, however, like so many subsequent antinarcotics
laws, failed to worlc despite the promptness and thoroughness of
the punishment. When opium dens became illegal, &quot;The vice
was indulged in much less openly, but none the less extensively,
for although the larger smoking-houses were closed, the small
dens in Cbinatown were well patronized, and the vice grew surely
and steadily.&quot;. Indeed, the new law &quot;seemed to add zest
to their enjoyment.&quot; 7 A similar ordinance was passed in
Virginia City, Nevada, the following year.8 This also failed to
accomplish its purpose; hence the State of Nevada passed a more
stringent act a year or two later.6 Other states and cities voted
similar statutes soon after.</p>

<p>==================================================================
</p>

<p>When these laws failed as well, Congress took a hand. Before
opium can be smoked, it must be specially prepared; and weak
opium containing less than the usual amount of morphine is used
in its preparation. In 1883, Congress raised the tariff on opium
prepared for smoking from $6 to $10 a pound; ' and in 1887 it
prohibited altogether the importation of the kind of weak
opium-that containing less than 9 percent morphine- used for
preparing smoking opium. The 1887 law also prohibited the
importation of opium by Chinese, and a law three years later
limited the manufacture of smoking opium to American citizens.11</p>

<p>The results of these steps were set forth in a letter dated
January 12, 1888, from the Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The
effect, he wrote, had been &quot;to stimulate smuggling,
extensively practiced by systematic organizations [presumably the
Chinese &quot;tongs&quot; or mutual benefit societies on the
Pacific coast. Recently completed facilities for transcontinental
transportation have enabled the opium smugglers to extend their
illicit traffic to our Northern border. Although all possible
efforts have been made by this Department to suppress the
traffic, it is found practically impossible to do so.&quot; 12</p>

<p>The law was not changed, however; indeed, the tariff on
smoking opium was further increased, from $10 to $12 per pound in
1890. Then, in 1897, it was reduced to $6 a pound
&quot;experience having at last taught that it could not bear a
higher rate without begetting an extensive surreptitious
manufacture or serious smuggling operations.&quot; Following the
reduction in the tariff, &quot;the amount that passed through the
customs houses . . . progressively increased.&quot; 13</p>

<p>Throughout this period, states and cities continued to pass
laws against opium smoking;* by 1914 there were twenty-seven such
laws in effect.. Yet the amount of smoking opium legally imported
continued to rise steadily, as shown in Table 2. 14 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>*Several of these laws also made it a crime to possess a pipe
for the smoking of opium precedent for later laws prohibiting the
possession of hypodermic needles and syringes without a
prescription. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>There was a lesson implicit in these import figures. During
more than thirty years of city, state, and federal efforts to
suppress opium smoking, the amount smoked per year increased
sevenfold-without taking account of smuggled supplies.</p>

<p>In 1909, the importation of smoking opium was prohibited
altogether.l5 This law was successful in the sense that smoking
opium imported through the customhouses fell to zero, but it did
not solve the opium-smoking problem. Congress in January 1914
found it necessary to amend the 1909 law 16 and to pass an
additional statute imposing a prohibitive tax ($300 per pound) on
opium prepared for smoking within the United States.7 In December
1914 Congress passed the Harrison Narcotic Act, with far broader
provisional~ </p>

<p>(see Chapter 8). Yet as late as 1930, according to Federal
Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger and United States
Attorney William F. Tompkins, &quot;opium dens could be found in
almost any American city.&quot; 19<br>

<p>One reason for the failure of these anti-opium-smoking laws,
and of subsequent anti narcotics laws, appears obvious. They were
aimed at private transactions between willing sellers and
willing, usually eager, buyers Thus there were no complainants.
Other such laws include the Volstead Act, since repealed, which
prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages; the laws against
fornication, homosexual acts, and other sexual acts between
consenting individuals in private; the laws against gambling; and
the drug laws generally. The phrase &quot;crimes without
victims&quot; has been applied to such acts; they can more
accurately be called &quot;crimes without complainants.&quot; It
is hard to cite a law aimed at crimes of this class which has had
much effect in curbing the behavior aimed at..* </p>

<hr>

<p>* -all laws which can be violated without doing any one an
injury are laughed at. Nay, so far are they from doing anything
to control the desires and passions o men that, on the
contrary, they direct and incite men's thoughts the rnore toward
those wry objects; for we always strive toward what is forbidden
and desire the things we are not allowed to have. And men of
leisure are never deficient in the ingenuity needed to enable
them to outwit laws framed to regulate things which cannot be
entirely forbidden.... He who tries to detennine everything by
law will foment clime rather than lessen it.&quot;-Baruch Spinoza
(1632-1677).20</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mere fact that a law fails to achieve its goal fully is of
course not a sufficient reason for repealing it; witness the laws
against murder. The basic argument against laws creating crimes
without complainants must rest on evidence that they not only
fail but also, in the process of failing, do more harm than good.
Such evidence exists with respect to the laws against opium
smoking. For one effect of these laws was to convert opium
smokers to more hazardous forms of opiate use.</p>

<p>&quot;Opium smoking is vastly less vicious than
morphine-taking,&quot; wrote an American authority on opiates,
Dr. Charles B. Towns, in 1912.21 </p>

<p>Dr. Marie Nyswander also commented on opium smoking, in 1956: </p>

<p>There is a pattern of self-limitation or restraint in opium
smoking as practiced in countries where it is socially
acceptable. It is common for natives of these countries to
indulge in opium smoking one night a week, much as Americans may
indulge in alcoholic beverages at a Saturday night party....
families who accept opium smoking as part of their culture are
mindful of its dangers much as we are mindful of the dangers of
overindulgence in alcohol.22</p>

<p>The reasons for the lesser harmfulness of opium smoking in
moderation are not hard to find. The opium used, as noted above,
is of a specially weak type containing less than 9 percent
morphine. Only about 10 percent of the morphine in this weak
opium enters the vapor, and only a portion of the morphine in the
vapor enters the human bloodstream when inhaled. Since the opium
is heated rather than burned, only smoke-free vapor is inhaled;
there are no &quot;tars&quot; or other carcinogens to cause
cancer. The so-called &quot;opium smoker&quot; is actually a
vapor inhaler. At a very rough estimate, a smoker would have to
smoke 300 or 400 grains of opium to get a dose equivalent to the
intravenous injection (&quot;mainlining-) of one grain of heroin.
Even heavy opium smokers actually smoke less than this daily..
And the opium-smoking dose is necessarily spread over a
considerable span of time rather than being absorbed into the
bloodstream almost instantaneously, as in mainlining. Surely the
nineteenth-century enemies of opium smoking did not and could not
foresee that the new laws were starting this country down the
dismal road from that relatively innocent &quot;vice&quot; to the
intravenous injection of heroin-the dominant form of illegal
opiate use today; yet that was in fact the sequel.</p>

<p>~ Dr. Charles B. Towns wrote (1912) &quot;The average
opium-smoker consuming twenty-five pills a day gets only the
equivalent of about a quarter grain [15 milligrams] of morphine
taken hypodermically or of a half grain taken by the mouth. A
beginner could not smoke a quarter of that quantity.... 22</p>

<p>Dr. Lawrence Kolb wrote (1925): &quot;Case 35, now
thirty-eight years of age, started smoking opium twenty years ago
[in 1905]. After the importation of smoking opium was prevented
by law, he used morphine, and when this could no longer be
secured, he changed to heroin.&quot; This was the common pattern.</p>

Illicit Drugs</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Chapter 7 </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><strong>The Pure -Food and Drug Act of 1906</strong></font><br>
</p>

<p>A major step forward in the control of opiate addiction was
taken in 1906 </p>

<p>when Congress passed the first Pure Food and Drug Act despite
opposition </p>

<p>from the patent-medicine interests. The pressures to pass the
act were </p>

<p>intense-generated by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley and his crusading
journalistic </p>

<p>followers, notably Samuel Hopkins Adams,' who were known as
&quot;muckrakers.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>The 1906 act required that medicines containing opiates and
certain other </p>

<p>drugs must say so on their labels.2 Later amendments to the
act also </p>

<p>required that the quantity of each drug be truly stated on the
label, and </p>

<p>that the drugs meet official standards of identity and purity.
Thus, for a </p>

<p>time the act actually served to safeguard addicts.<br>
</p>

<p>The efforts leading to the 1906 act, the act itself and
subsequent </p>

<p>amendments, and educational campaigns urging families not to
use patent </p>

<p>medicines containing opiates, no doubt helped curb the making
of new </p>

<p>addicts. Indeed, there is evidence of a modest decline in
opiate addiction </p>

<p>from the peak in the 1890s until 1914.3<br>
</p>

<p>For those already addicted, however, the protection afforded
by the 1906 </p>

<p>act and by subsequent amendments was short-lived, for in 1914
Congress </p>

<p>passed the Harrison Narcotic Act, which cut off altogether the
supply of </p>

<p>legal opiates to addicts. As a result, the door was opened
wide to </p>

<p>adulterated, contaminated, and misbranded black-market
narcotics of all </p>

<p>kinds. The heroin available on the street in the United States
today, for </p>

<p>example, is a highly dangerous mixture of small amounts of
heroin with </p>

<p>large and varying amounts of adulterants. The black market
similarly </p>

<p>distributes today large quantities of adulterated,
contaminated, and </p>

<p>misbranded LSD and other drugs. The withdrawal of the
protection of the </p>

<p>food-and-drug laws from the users of illicit drugs, as we
shall show, has </p>

<p>been one of the sign)ficant factors in reducing addicts to
their present </p>

<p>miserable status, and in making drug use so damaging today. </p>

other occupational hazards of addiction</b></font> </p>

</p>

<p>Chapter 4 of this Report reviewed in detail the effects of
heroin and other opiates on addicts, including deleterious
physiological effects traceable to the drugs themselves.
Narcotics addicts today face other physiological hazards that are
traceable to the narcotics laws, to the adulteration,
contamination, and exorbitant black-market prices that those laws
foster, and to other legal and social (as distinct from
pharmacological) factors. Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe has described some
of these risks in Goodman and Gilman's textbook (1970):
&quot;Undoubtedly, the high cost and impurities of illicit drugs
in the United States exact their toll. The high incidence of
venereal disease reflects the occupational hazard of the many
females who earn their drug money through prostitution. The
average annual death rate among young, adult heroin addicts is
several times higher than that for nonaddicts of similar age and
ethnic backgrounds. . . . The suicide rate among adult addicts is
likewise considerably higher than that of the general
population.&quot; 1 </p>

<p>Because &quot;the preferred route of administration is
intravenous,&quot; Dr. Jaffe continues, &quot;there is sharing of
implements of injection and a failure to employ hygienic
technics, with a resultant high incidence of endocarditis, and
hepatitis, and other infections.&quot; 2 </p>

<p>The exorbitant price of black-market heroin, Dr. Jaffe might
have added, is one of the factors that makes intravenous
injection &quot;the preferred route of administration,&quot; for
&quot;mainlining&quot; is the cheapest way to forestall
withdrawal symptoms. And the laws restricting possession of
injection equipment, under penalty of imprisonment, increase the
risk of needleborne infections by encouraging the sharing of
implements. </p>

<p>There remains to be considered yet another risk of heroin
addiction, the most publicized hazard of all-death from
&quot;heroin overdose.&quot; Because these deaths are a source of
such widespread concern, and also because they are so widely
misunderstood, even by authorities on heroin addiction and by
addicts themselves, we shall examine the data in detail. Much of
the discussion that follows is focused on New York City, since
the deaths attributed to heroin overdose are most numerous there
and since the New York City data are published in convenient
form. </p>

<p>&quot;Prior to 1943, there were relatively few deaths among
addicts from overdosage. &quot; 3 By the 1950s, however, nearly
half of all deaths among New York City addicts were being
attributed to &quot;acute reaction to dosage or overdosage
.&quot; 4 In 1969, about 70 percent of all New York addict deaths
were assigned the &quot;overdose&quot; labels and in 1970, the
proportion was about 80 percent.- The number of deaths so
designated by New York City's Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner increased from very few or none at all before 1943 to
about 800 in 1969 and 1970 .7 </p>

<p>During this same twenty-eight-year span, addict deaths from
all other causes-infections, violence, suicide, and so
on-increased very little. The enormous increase in number of
deaths among addicts shown in Figure 2 was attributed almost
entirely to &quot;overdose&quot; deaths. </p>

<p>The number of deaths throughout the United States attributed
to heroin overdose from 1943 to date must total many thousands.
In New York City it was reported that narcotics, chiefly heroin,
were the leading cause of death in 1969 and 1970 in all males
aged fifteen to tbirty-five,8 including nonaddicts. This can
properly be characterized as an epidemic; the general alarm over
these deaths is thoroughly warranted. </p>

<p>There are two relatively simple ways, however, to prevent
deaths from heroin overdose. </p>

<p>First, addicts can be warned to take only their usual dose of
heroin rather than risking death by taking too much. </p>

<p>Second, even in cases where an addict takes a vastly excessive
dose despite the warning, death usually can be readily prevented,
for death from an overdose of opiates is ordinarily a slow
process. &quot;in cases of fatal poisoning with morphine, the
time of death may vary roughly from one to twelve hours.&quot; 9
The first signs are lethargy and stupor, followed by prolonged
coma. If, after a period of hours, death does ensue, it is
usually from respiratory failure. During the minutes or hours
following the injection of a potentially fatal overdose, death
can be readily forestalled by administering an effective
antidote: a narcotic antagonist known as nalorpbine (Nalline).10
Nalorphine brings a victim of opiate overdose out of his stupor
or coma within a few minutes. Since there is plenty of time and
since nalorphine is stocked in pharmacies and hospital emergency
rooms throughout the country, the death of anyone due to heroin
overdose is very rarely excusable. </p>

<p>But alas, the two standard precautions against
overdose-warnings against taking too much and administration of
an antidote-are in fact wholly ineffective in the current crisis,
for the thousands of deaths attributed to heroin overdose are not
in fact due to heroin overdose at all. The evidence falls under
three major rubrics. </p>

<p>(1) The deaths cannot be due to overdose. </p>

<p>(2) There has never been any evidence that they are due to
overdose. </p>

<p>(3) There has long been a plethora of evidence demonstrating
that they are not due to overdose. </p>

<p>Let us review these three bodies of data in detail. </p>

<p>(1) Why these deaths cannot be due to overdose. The amount of
morphine or heroin required to kill a human being who is not
addicted to opiates remains in doubt but it is certainly many
times the usual dose (10 milligrams) contained in a New York City
bag. &quot;There is little accurate information,&quot; Drs. A. J.
Reynolds and Lowell 0. Randall report in Morphine and Allied
Drugs (1967). &quot;The figures that have been reported show wide
variation.&quot; 12 This ignorance no doubt stems from the rarity
of morphine or heroin overdose deaths. The amounts of morphine or
heroin needed to kill a nonaddict have been variously estimated
at 120 milligrams (oral),13 200 milligrams, 14 250
milligrams,&quot; and 350 milligrams16-though it has also been
noted that nonaddicts have survived much larger doses .17 The
best experimental evidence comes from Drs. Lawrence Kolb and A.
G. Du Mez of the United States Public Health Service; in 1931
they demonstrated that it takes seven or eight milligrams of
heroin per kilogram of body weight, injected directly into a
vein, to kill unaddicted monkeys.&quot; On this basis, it would
take 500 milligrams or more (50 New York City bags full,
administered in a single injection) to kill an unaddicted human
adult. </p>

<p>Virtually all of the victims whose deaths are falsely labeled
as due to heroin overdose, moreover, are addicts who have already
developed a tolerance for opiates-and even enormous amounts of
morphine or heroin do not kill addicts. In the Philadelphia study
of the 1920s, for example, sonic addicts reported using 28 grains
(1,680 milligrams) of morphine or heroin per day.&quot;' This is
forty times the usual New York City daily dose. In one
Philadelphia experiment, 1,800 milligrams of morphine were
injected into an addict over a two-and-a-half-hour period. This
vast dose didn't even make him sick.20 </p>

<p>Nor does a sudden increase in dosage produce significant side
effects, much less death, among addicts. In the Philadelphia
study, three addicts were given six, seven, and nine times their
customary doses-&quot;mainlined.&quot; Far from causing death,
the drug &quot;resulted in insignificant changes in the pulse and
respiration rates, electrocardiogram, chemical studies of the
blood, and the behavior of the addict.&quot; 21 The addicts
didn't even become drowsy.22 </p>

<p>Recent studies at the Rockefeller Hospital in New York City,
under the direction of Dr. Vincent P. Dole, have confirmed the
remarkable resistance of addicts to overdose. Addicts receiving
daily maintenance doses of 40 milligrams to 80 milligrams of
methadone, a synthetic narcotic (see Chapter 14), were given as
much as 200 milligrams of unadulterated heroin in a single
intravenous injection. They &quot;bad no change in respiratory
center or any other vital organs .&quot; 23 </p>

<p>(2) There is no evidence to show that deaths attributed to
overdose are in fact so caused. Whenever someone takes a
drug-whether strychnine, a barbiturate, heroin, or some other
substance-and then dies without other apparent cause, the
suspicion naturally arises that he may have taken too much of the
drug and and died of poisoning an overdose. To confirm or refute
this suspicion, an autopsy is performed, following a
well-established series of procedures. </p>

<p>If the drug was taken by mouth, for example, the stomach
contents and feces are analyzed in order to identify the drug and
to determine whether an excessive amount is present. If the drug
was injected, the tissues surrounding the injection site are
similarly analyzed. The blood, urine, and other body fluids and
tissues can also be analyzed and the quantity of drug present
determined. </p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence, too, can in some cases establish with
reasonable certainly that someone has died of overdose. If a
Patient fills a prescription for a hundred barbiturate tablets,
for example, and is found dead the next morning with only a few
tablets left in the bottle, death from barbiturate poisoning is a
reasonable hypothesis to be explored. Similarly, if an addict
dies after &quot;shooting up,&quot; and friends who were present
report that he injected many times his usual dose, the
possibility of death from heroin overdose deserves serious
consideration. </p>

<p>Further, in cases where an addict has died following an
injection of heroin, and the syringe he used is found nearby or
still sticking in his vein, the contents of the syringe can be
examined to determine whether it contained heroin of exceptional
strength. And there are other ways of establishing at least a
prima facie case for an overdose diagnosis. </p>

<p>A conscientious search of the United States medical literature
throughout recent decades has failed to turn up a single
scientific paper reporting that heroin overdose, as established
by these or any other reasonable methods of determining overdose,
is in fact a cause of death among American heroin addicts. The
evidence that addicts have been dying by the hundreds of heroin
overdose is simply nonexistent. </p>

<p>At this point the mystery deepens. If even enormous doses of
heroin will not kill an addict, and if there exists no shred of
evidence to indicate that addicts or nonaddicts are in fact dying
of heroin overdose, why is the overdose myth almost universally
accepted? The answer lies in the customs of the United States
coroner-medical examiner system. </p>

<p>Whenever anyone dies without a physician in attendance to
certify the cause of death, it is the duty of the local coroner
or medical examiner to investigate, to have an autopsy performed
if indicated, and then formally to determine and record the cause
of death. The parents, spouse, or children of the dead person can
then ask the coroner for his findings. Newspaper reporters
similarly rely on the coroner or medical examiner to explain a
newsworthy death. No coroner, of course, wants to be in a
position of having to answer &quot;I don't know&quot; to such
queries. A coroner is supposed to know-and if he doesn't know, he
is supposed to find out. </p>

<p>At some point in the history of heroin addiction, probably in
the early 1940s, the custom arose among coroners and medical
examiners of labeling as &quot;heroin overdose&quot; all deaths
among heroin addicts the true cause of which could not be
determined. These &quot;overdose&quot; determinations rested on
only two findings: (1) that the victim was a heroin addict who
&quot;shot up&quot; prior to his death; and (2) that there was no
evidence of suicide, violence, infection, or other natural
cause.24 No evidence that the victim had taken a large dose was
required to warrant a finding of death from overdose. This
curious custom continues today. Thus, in common coroner and
medical examiner parlance, &quot;death from heroin overdose&quot;
is synonymous with &quot;death from unknown causes after
injecting heroin.&quot; </p>

<p>During the 1940s, this custom of convenience did little
apparent harm. Most deaths among heroin addicts were due to
tetanus, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, and other
infections, to violence, or to suicide, and they were properly
labeled as such by coroners and medical examiners. It was only an
occasional death which baffled the medical examiner, and which
was therefore signed out as due to &quot;overdose.&quot; But,
beginning about 1943, a strange new kind of death began to make
its appearance among heroin addicts .25 The cause of this new
kind of death was not known, and remains unknown today-though it
is now quite common. </p>

<p>A striking feature of this mysterious new mode of death is its
suddenness. Instead of occurring after one or more hours of
lethargy, stupor, and coma, as in true overdose cases, death
occurs within a few minutes or less-perhaps only a few seconds
after the drug is injected. Indeed, </p>

<p>11 collapse and death are so rapid,&quot; one authority
reports, &quot;that the syringe was found in the vein of the
victim or on the floor after having dropped out of the vein, and
the tourniquet was still in place on the arm .&quot; 26 This
explains in part why nalorphine and other narcotic antagonists,
highly effective antidotes in true opiate overdose cases, are
useless in the cases falsely labeled overdose. </p>

<p>An even more striking feature of these mysterious deaths is a
sudden and massive flooding of the lungs with fluid: pulmonary
edema. In many cases it is not even necessary to open the lungs
or X-ray them to find the edema; &quot;an abundance of partly
dried frothy white edema fluid [is seen] oozing from the nostrils
or mouth &quot; 27 when the body is first found. Neither of these
features suggests overdose-but since &quot;overdose&quot; has
come to be a synonym for &quot;cause unknown,&quot; and since the
cause of these sudden deaths characterized by lung edema is
unknown, they are lumped under the &quot;overdose&quot; rubric. </p>

<p>Not all of the deaths attributed to heroin overdose are
necessarily characterized by suddenness and by massive pulmonary
edema, but several studies have shown that a high proportion of
all &quot;overdose&quot; deaths share these two
characteristics.28 </p>

<p>(3) Evidence demonstrating that these deaths are not due to
overdose is plentiful. This evidence has been summarized in a
series of scientific papers, beginning in 1966, by New York
City's Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Milton Helpern, and his
associate, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Michael M. Baden.
At a meeting of the Society for the Study of Addiction held in
London in 1966, Dr. Helpern explained that the most conspicuous
feature of so-called &quot;overdose&quot; deaths is the massive
pulmonary edema. When asked the cause of the edema, he cautiously
responded: </p>

<p>This is a very interesting question. To my knowledge it is not
known why the pulmonary edema develops in these cases.... This
reaction sometimes occurs with the intravenous injections of
mixtures, which as far as is known, do not contain any heroin,
but possibly some other substance. The reaction does not appear
to be specific. It does not seem to be peculiar to one substance,
but it is most commonly seen with mixtures in which heroin is the
smallest component. </p>

<p>In a paper published in the New York State Journal of Medicine
for September 15, 1966, Dr. Helpern again cast doubt on the myth
that these deaths are due to overdose. &quot;Formerly such acute
deaths were attributed to overdose of the heroin contained in the
sample injected,&quot; Dr. Helpern reported-but he went on to
cite several lines of evidence arguing against the overdose
theory: </p>

<p>... Unexpected acute deaths may occur in some addicts who
inject themselves with heroin mixtures even though others who
take the same usual . . . dose from the same sample at the same
time may suffer no dangerous effect. In some fatal acute cases,
the rapidity and type of reaction do not suggest overdose alone
but rather an overwhelming shocklike process due to sensitivity
to the injected material. The toxicologic examination of the
tissues in such fatalities, where the reaction was so rapid that
the syringe and needle were still in the vein of the victim when
the body was found, demonstrated only the presence of alkaloid,
not overdosage. In other acute deaths, in which the circumstances
and autopsy findings were positive, the toxicologist could not
even find any evidence of alkaloid in the tissues or body fluids.
Thus, there does not appear to be any quantitative correlation
between the acute fulminating lethal effect and the amount of
heroin taken. . . .30 </p>

<p>Dr. Helpern's associate, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Baden,
went on to further discredit the already implausible overdose
theory at a joint meeting of two American Medical Association
drug-dependency committees held in Palo Alto, California, in
February 1969. </p>

<p>&quot;The majority of deaths,&quot; Dr. Baden told the AMA
physicians, &quot;are due to an acute reaction to the intravenous
injection of the heroin-quinine-sugar mixture. This type of death
is often referred to as an 'overdose,' which is a misnomer. Death
is not due to a pharmacological overdose in the vast majority of
cases.&quot; 31 </p>

<p>At the same AMA committee meeting and at a meeting of the
Medical Society of the County of New York, Dr. Baden cited six
separate lines of evidence overturning the &quot;heroin
overdose&quot; theory. </p>

<p>First, when the packets of heroin found near the bodies of
dead addicts are examined, they do not differ from ordinary
packets. &quot;No qualitative or quantitative differences&quot;
are found.32 This rules out the possibility that some incredibly
stupid processor may have filled a bag with pure heroin instead
of the usual adulterated mix. </p>

<p>Second, when the syringes used by addicts immediately before
dying are examined, the mixture found in them does not contain
more heroin than usual. </p>

<p>Third, when the urine of addicts allegedly dead of overdose is
analyzed, there is no evidence of overdose. </p>

<p>Fourth, the tissues surrounding the site of the fatal
injection show no signs of high heroin concentration. </p>

<p>Fifth, neophytes unaccustomed to heroin rather than addicts
tolerant to opiates would be expected to be susceptible to death
from overdose. But &quot;almost all of those dying&quot; of
alleged overdose, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Baden reported,
&quot;are long-term users.&quot; </p>

<p>Sixth, again according to Dr. Baden, &quot;addicts often
'shoot' in a group, all using the same heroin supply, and rarely
does more than one addict die at such a time.&quot; 33 </p>

<p>These definitive refutations of the heroin overdose theory
should, of course, have led to two prompt steps: a warning to
addicts that something other than overdose is causing these
hundreds of addict deaths annually -and an intensive search for
the true cause of the deaths. But neither of these steps has been
taken. Hence the news media go right on talking about
&quot;heroin overdose&quot; deaths. &quot;Death from acute
reaction to heroin overdose&quot; and other complicated phrases
are also used; these phrases similarly conceal the fact that
these deaths are not due to overdose. </p>

<p>How can the &quot;heroin overdose&quot; myth not only survive
but flourish even after these repeated scientific debunkings? Two
stenographic transcripts provide an answer. </p>

<p>The first is the transcript of a press conference held at the
Rockefeller University on October 27, 1969, in connection with
the Second National Conference on Methadone Treatment. In the
course of his remarks to the assembled reporters, Deputy Chief
Medical Examiner Baden there discussed at some length a case of
what he described as an &quot;addict who died of an overdose of
heroin.&quot; 34 The reporters present naturally referred
thereafter to this death as a &quot;heroin overdose&quot; case. </p>

<p>At the scientific meeting held in the same room on the same
day, however, Dr. Baden described the same death in quite
different terms. To the scientists he stated that the addict in
question &quot;died of acute reaction to injection of heroin, a
so-called overdose.&quot; When even this description was
challenged by a fellow physician, who pointed out that addicts
don't die following even enormous doses,35 Dr. Baden went on to
explain that whenever I say 'overdose,' it is in quotation
marks.&quot; 36 </p>

<p>The reporters, of course, could not see those invisible
quotation marks when they listened to Dr. Baden at his press
conferences and interviews. They quite naturally took him
literally-and continued to inform the public that addicts were
dying of overdose.* </p>

<p>Even Chief Medical Examiner Helpern eventually became
convinced that the &quot;heroin overdose&quot; publicity
emanating from his office was &quot;dangerously wrong.&quot; In
testimony before the Select Committee on Crime of the United
States House of Representatives on June 27, 1970, Dr. Helpern
stated: </p>

<p>A difficulty has been that people have considered these fatal
reactions the result of overdose. Now, to some people the
designation overdose means [taking] more than usual with the
implication that if you are careful of how much is taken there is
no danger of anything other than the usual effect. This
impression which many addicts have is dangerously wrong. 38 </p>

<p>Yet a full year after Dr. Helpern testified, neither he nor
Dr. Baden nor anyone else had yet ventured to correct the
&quot;dangerously wrong&quot; view that was being foisted on the
New York and national news media. Almost everyone who did not
read Dr. Helpern's and Dr. Baden's papers in the medical journals
still believed that heroin addicts by the hundreds were dying of
overdose. Worse yet, nobody had as yet even begun to investigate
seriously the crucial question: If these hundreds of addicts a
year aren't dying of overdose, what are they dying of? </p>

<p>Fortunately, enough is already known to suggest some promising
directions for immediate research. </p>

<p>Most deaths from so-called overdose, as noted above, are
characterized by suddenness and by pulmonary edema. No other
cause of death-such as tetanus, bacterial endocarditis,
hepatitis, or a knife or gunshot wound -is found. In
approximately 60 percent of autopsies, a 1970 study indicates,
there is also cerebral edema (accumulation of fluid in the brain)
along with widespread fragmentation of the astrocytes
(star-shaped cells) in the brain.39 A death with these
characteristics, occurring in a heroin addict, constitutes a
dramatic and readily identifiable syndrome which Dr. Helpern has
called &quot;acute fatal reaction to the intravenous injection of
crude mixtures of heroin and other substances.&quot; We shall
here apply a less cumbersome label: &quot;Syndrome X.&quot; </p>

<p>1 Thus in the New York Times for December 16, 1969, a reporter
was led to state without qualification: &quot;About 800 addicts
of all ages died this year from overdoses, according to Dr.
Baden.&quot; 37<br>
</p>

<p>One clue to the true cause of Syndrome X is its initial
appearance about 1943, its relative rarity for the next few
years, and its recent rapid increase in frequency. The time
sequence obviously suggests that the cause of Syndrome X must be
some factor introduced about 1943 and affecting a vastly
increased number of addicts during 1969 and 1970. Heroin clearly
does not qualify; it was widely used long before 1943. Indeed, a
highly significant fact about Syndrome X is that it has become
more and more frequent as the amount of heroin in the New York
City bag has gone down and down. These deaths are, if anything,
associated with &quot;underdose&quot; rather than overdose. </p>

<p>One theory sometimes advanced is that Syndrome X deaths are
caused by the quinine in the bag. Quinine was introduced as an
adulterant of heroin sometime after 1939, when an epidemic of
malaria spread by contaminated injection needles hit New York
City addicts 40 thus the time of introduction fits the Syndrome X
timetable. Some addicts discovered that the quinine contributed
to the sensation known as a &quot;rush&quot; immediately after
injection. Heroin traffickers also discovered that the bitter
taste of the quinine makes it impossible for addicts to gauge the
concentration of heroin in the bag by tasting the mixture. For
these and possibly other reasons, quinine has remained a standard
adulterant of New York City heroin ever since. </p>

<p>Perhaps the first suggestion that quinine might be causing New
York City's Syndrome X deaths came from Dr. F. E. Camps, the
United Kingdom Home Office pathologist in charge of investigating
opiate deaths in England. At a conference of the Society for the
Study of Addiction held in London in September 1966 (which Chief
Medical Examiner Helpern attended), Dr. Camps stated: &quot;The
only comparable drug to heroin which causes rapid death with
pulmonary oedema is quinine. In this case patients start off with
discomfort in their chest, and then rapidly die. It is
conceivable that this could have some relation to [New York City]
heroin deaths .&quot; 41 </p>

<p>At the same conference an American pathologist, the late Dr.
Rudolph J. Muelling of the University of Kentucky Medical School,
added that a type of lung lesion similar to that found in
Syndrome X deaths &quot;is found to occur when one studies pure
quinine cases. In the United States this kind of lesion has been
found in several nurses attempting to induce abortions on
themselves. They take the quinine orally and the condition comes
on quite rapidly. The patients die of quinine alone.&quot; 42 </p>

<p>A second possible cause of Syndrome X deaths can best be
illustrated by two examples. </p>

<p>One is the case of &quot;C. G.,&quot; a heroin addict long
accustomed to mainlining his drug, who one day got drunk, took
his &quot;customary injection of heroin and collapsed shortly
thereafter.&quot; Subsequent X-rays showed lung edema.43 </p>

<p>Another is the case of a heroin addict whose death was
recently reported by Dr. George R. Gay and his associates at the
Haight-Ashbury Medical Clinic, San Francisco. This addict first
&quot;shot some reds&quot; (that is, barbiturates) and then
&quot;fixed&quot; with heroin following the barbiturates. He died
of what was diagnosed as &quot;overdose of heroin .&quot; 44 </p>

<p>Cases such as these have given rise to the question whether
Syndrome X deaths may result from injecting heroin (with or
without quinine) into a body already laden with a
central-nervous-system depressant such as alcohol or a
barbiturate. </p>

<p>Addicts themselves would seem to deserve credit for first
suspecting that so-called &quot;heroin overdose&quot; deaths
might in fact result from the combined action of alcohol and
heroin. Back in 1958, a team headed by Dr. Ray E. Trussell and
Mr. Harold Alksne interviewed more than 200 New York City
addicts-alumni of the Riverside Hospital addiction treatment
program (see Chapter 10). In this as in other pre-1960 studies,
few addicts drank alcohol while on heroin, and they did not drink
much. When asked why, the addicts commonly gave two reasons. </p>

<p>One was that the effect of alcohol is &quot;offensive&quot; to
a man on heroin. &quot;The narcotic alone has an analgesic effect
which tends to quiet the individual. Alcohol, on the other hand
... has the capacity to agitate the individual in his
relationships with other people. This generally is offensive to
the addict.&quot; 45 </p>

<p>The other reason given by addicts in 1958 for not drinking
while on heroin is the first extant clue to the possible
relationship between alcohol and death from &quot;heroin
overdose.&quot; Addicts, the Trussell-Alksne team noted,
&quot;believe that the use of narcotics and alcohol in
combination is dangerous and might possibly lead to the death of
an individual.&quot; 46 By the 1960s, this awareness of the
hazard of shooting heroin while drunk had disappeared from the
addict scene. Addicts, like others, were evidently convinced by
the official announcements that those deaths were indeed due to
heroin overdose. </p>

<p>If the theory is sound that even an ordinary dose of an opiate
injected while drunk can produce death, then death could occur
when an ordinary drunk who is not addicted is brought into a
hospital emergency room with a painful injury and is given a
routine (10 milligram) injection of morphine to ease his pain.
Drs. William B. Deichmann and Horace W. Gerarde report in their
Toxicology of Drugs and Chemicals (1969 edition) that death may
in fact occur under such conditions. </p>

<p>&quot;The ordinary safe therapeutic dose of morphine,&quot;
they warn, in italics, in their textbook, &quot;may be fatal to
persons who have been drinking alcoholic beverages. Morphine in
therapeutic doses [similar to the doses commonly injected by
addicts] resulted in fatalities in individuals whose blood
alcohol levels ranged from 0.22 to 0.27%. Morphine is also
synergistic with barbiturates and related drugs.&quot; 47 Thus
the hazard of death from shooting an opiate while drunk on
alcohol or a barbiturate is familiar to some toxicologists even
though it has been ignored by authorities on drug addiction-and
by coroners and medical examiners-through the years. </p>

<p>If this alcohol-heroin and barbiturate-heroin explanation is
correct, the fact is of the utmost practical importance-for
hundreds of deaths a year might be prevented by warning addicts
not to shoot heroin while drunk on alcohol or barbiturates. </p>

<p>The alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis fits the Syndrome X time
schedule. Throughout the nineteenth century and well into the
twentieth, opiate addicts were known for their dislike of alcohol
while on opiates. As noted earlier, they turned to alcohol only
when deprived of their opiate supply or when trying to &quot;kick
the habit.&quot; This remains generally true today; an addict
rarely drinks while on heroin. He often drinks, however, when his
heroin supply runs out and withdrawal symptoms set in. During
World War 11, many heroin addicts were abruptly deprived of their
heroin supply for longer or shorter periods. If some of them
turned to alcohol, then connected with a fresh heroin supply and
&quot;shot up&quot; while still drunk, the first few identified
Syndrome X deaths might have occurred. The recent sharp increase
in Syndrome X deaths might similarly be explained by an increased
tendency to alternate alcohol or barbiturates with heroin as a
result of high heroin prices. As the amount of heroin in the New
York City bag went down and down, according to this theory, more
and more addicts got drunk-and died of Syndrome X following their
next &quot;fix.&quot; </p>

<p>Evidence in recent years for the use of alcohol by addicts
shortly before their death has been assembled from the New York
City files by Drs. Jane McCusker and Charles E. Cherubin. They
reviewed 588 city toxicology reports found in the files on
addicts who died in 1967. In 549 of these cases, tests for
alcohol had been run-and in 43 percent of the cases tested,
alcohol was in fact found .48 (Barbiturates were not reported
on.) Their findings led Drs. McCusker and Cherubin to suggest
that further research be promptly launched into the possible role
of alcohol and the barbiturates in so-called &quot;heroin
overdose&quot; cases. </p>

<p>The same suggestion has been tentatively made by Dr. Gay of
the Haight-Ashbury Medical Clinic. Thirty-seven percent of the
addicts attending the clinic, Dr. Gay states, report using
barbiturates &quot;for sedation and sleep&quot; when heroin
withdrawal symptoms set in; and 24 percent report using alcohol
similarly.49 Thus the stage is set for shooting heroin while
drunk on one or the other-and, perhaps, for sudden death from
overdose.&quot; </p>

<p>Two of the most publicized &quot;overdose deaths&quot; of
1970, Dr. Gay informed the National Heroin Conference in June
1971, fit precisely this pattern. These were the deaths of the
rock musician Jimi Hendrix and the singer Janis Joplin. Hendrix
was known to use both alcohol and barbiturates-and possibly also
heroin. Janis Joplin &quot;drank [alcohol] like an F. Scott
Fitzgerald legend,&quot; Dr. Gay adds-and also used narcotics.50
The magazine Time reported on October 19, 1970, shortly after
Janis Joplin's death: </p>

<p>The quart bottle of Southern Comfort [whiskey] that she held
aloft onstage was at once a symbol of her load and a way of
lightening it. As she emptied the bottle, she grew happier, more
radiant, and more freaked out.... </p>

<p>Last week, on a day that superficially at least seemed to be
less lonely than most, Janis Joplin died on the lowest and
saddest of notes. Returning to her Hollywood motel room after a
late-night recording session and some hard drinking with friends
at a nearby bar, she apparently filled a hypodermic needle with
heroin and shot it into her left arm. The injection killed her.51
</p>

<p>Janis Joplin's death, of course, was popularly attributed to
&quot;heroin overdose.&quot; If the alcohol-barbiturate-heroin
theory is correct, her fatal injection of heroin while drunk on
alcohol was the prototype of many other deaths similarly
mislabeled &quot;overdose.&quot; </p>

<p>The British experience with deaths attributed to heroin
overdose is consistent with the alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis.
Dr. Ramon Gardner of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and Maudsley
Hospital in London studied the records of 170 deaths known to
have occurred among addicts in Britain during the five-year
period 1965 through 1969. Twenty of these deaths were deemed
suicides, 24 were traceable to infections, 12 were from natural
causes, 11 were drownings, falls, murders, or other accidents,
and 6 occurred during treatment (of which two followed abrupt
withdrawal of narcotics when the addicts were imprisoned). Eight
more were due to overdose of barbiturates or other nonopiate
drugs. This left a maximum of 89 mysterious deaths out of 170
which might have been caused by accidental opiate overdose-or by
something else.52 </p>

<p>Dr. Gardner then went on to study in more detail 47 of these
deaths possibly due to heroin overdose. In a number of cases, he
found that the addicts bad been confined in a hospital, prison,
or detention center or had for other reasons been abstinent from
opiates for a week or longer, and had thus lost at least a
portion of their tolerance for opiates. They had then injected an
opiate-some of them on the day of discharge, others within the
next day or two. Thus these deaths might have been due to
overdose-though evidence was lacking that the victims had in fact
taken fatally large doses. (Merely doubling or quadrupling the
dose, it will be recalled, will not kill even nonaddicts.) </p>

<p>But in at least 21 of the 47 cases, there had been no
withdrawal from opiates prior to death, so that tolerance had not
been lost. And in some cases, the dose preceding death was so
small-as little as 20 or 30 milligrams of heroin, for example-as
to establish beyond question that overdose was not the cause .53 </p>

<p>These British deaths, accordingly, remain mysterious, like
deaths from Syndrome X in the United States. Among several likely
explanations, Dr. Gardner himself noted, is the possibility that
these addicts may have taken some other drug, perhaps a
central-nervous-system depressant, at the same time. Since there
is no quinine in British opiates, that drug must be exonerated in
the British deaths. </p>

<p>Another British drug authority adds that in Britain as in the
United States, &quot;many of those who die, in fact, have taken
barbiturates as well [as opiates] at the same time.&quot; 54 </p>

<p>It might prove absurdly easy to confirm the
alcohol-barbiturate hypothesis. All that might be necessary would
be to addict a few monkeys or other primates to heroin,
intoxicate them on alcohol or barbiturates, and then inject
modest doses of heroin. If the monkeys drop dead of Syndrome X, a
warning against shooting heroin while drunk on alcohol or
barbiturates might save many hundreds of lives a year throughout
the world. </p>

<p>Several other possible explanations of Syndrome X deaths have
been offered. No theory has yet been proved. Worse yet, no theory
has ever been experimentally tested. The time has surely come to
determine the cause (or causes) of Syndrome X and bring to a
close this tragic series of deaths. If 800 respectable citizens
instead of heroin addicts had dropped dead in New York City of a
mysterious syndrome in 1970, a gargantuan research program would
no doubt have been promptly launched. </p>

<p>If the Syndrome X deaths are due to quinine or to any other
adulterant or contaminant in the bag, the responsibility clearly
rests with the American heroin black market for selling unsafe
mixes. If the cause of these deaths is the shooting of heroin
while drunk on alcohol or barbiturates, the black-market
distribution system remains at least indirectly responsible, for
it is largely the high cost of black-market heroin that makes
heroin users turn to alcohol and barbiturates on occasion-and
thus, perhaps, to risk death from Syndrome X. </p>

<p>The two steps which must now be taken are (1) to stop sweeping
these mysterious deaths under the carpet by falsely labeling them
&quot;overdose&quot; and (2) to launch an intensive clinical and
experimental search for what is in fact killing these addicts. <br>

<hr>

<p>During the 1960s, Dr. Ralph M. Susman of the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and his associate
Lenore R. Kupperstein, prepared a &quot;Bibliography on the
Inhalation of Glue Fumes and Other Toxic Vapors,&quot; which they
published in the Spring 1968 issue of the International Journal
of the Addictions. Despite diligent search, the earliest
references to glue-sniffing in either the medical or the popular
literature that they were able to find dated from 1959.1 A
similarly thorough search in the course of preparing this
Consumers Union Report has turned up no earlier mention of
glue-sniffing. Other documented studies of glue-sniffing are
similarly void of references earlier than 1959. Thus, while it is
likely that children (and adults as well) sniffed glue on
occasion before 1959, the practice either went unobserved or,
more probably, was not deemed worthy of recording. The first
known mentions of glue-sniffing in print date from 1959 and
concern the arrest for sniffing glue of children in Tucson,
Arizona, Pueblo, Colorado, and perhaps other Western cities. Laws
against sniffing glue or sniffing anything else, of course, did
not yet exist. Accounts of these remarkable arrests reached
Denver, where two reporters investigated. Their account of
glue-sniffing-the first full description in the mass media that
has yet turned up-appeared in Empire, the Sunday magazine
supplement of the Denver Post, on August 2, 1959. The article
reported: &quot;Police in Pueblo, Colo. and several other cities
in the West and Midwest report that juveniles seeking a quick
bang and a mild jag spread liquid glue on the palms of their
hands, then cup their hands over their mouth and nose and inhale
deeply.&quot; 2 Alerted by these police actions in other cities,
the two reporters interviewed Denver police officers concerned
with juvenile problems, and other authorities, to learn about
glue-sniffing in Denver. Apparently Denver bad no cases to
report, for the story led off with an account of a child
accidentally affected by glue fumes in a poorly-ventilated
basement room; and an expert the two reporters interviewed-Dr.
Samuel Johnson, director of Denver's Poison Control
Center-similarly warned against using quick-drying glue in a room
with the windows closed, lest intoxication accidentally result.
Dr. Johnson was on the whole reassuring about the glue
&quot;menace.&quot; If a person is affected by the fumes, he
said, he need only go out and breathe fresh air to recover.
Permanent injury is possible only if the exposure is prolonged
and heavy-as when a worker in a glue factory breathes the stuff
all day long every day. Yet the pioneer Denver story, setting a
pattern soon to be followed by newspapers and magazines
throughout the country, carried a scare headline: </p>

<p>SOME GLUES ARE DANGEROUS Heavy Inhalation Can Cause Anemia or
Brain Damage This and subsequent warnings in the mass media were
all based on the results of earlier industrial studies that, as
noted above, could not be justifiably applied to the
glue-sniffing fad. The newspaper story also explained that one
way to inhale glue is to soak a handkerchief with glue and hold
it over the mouth and nose.&quot; A photograph accompanying the
article showed a young man demonstrating how the glue-soaked
handkerchief should be held. Interesting results were promised if
the glue were sniffed as directed: &quot;The first effect of
breathing the undiluted fumes is dizziness, followed by
drowsiness. There is a feeling of suspension of reality. Later
there is lack of coordination of muscle and mind.&quot; In a
word, it was like getting drunk. The effects of this newspaper
article, published August 2, 1959-and no doubt of other similar
articles and broadcasts in other Denver mass media
thereafter-were visible by June 1960, when Denver police reported
that during the past six or eight months they had investigated
some 50 cases of glue-sniffing. In addition to these 50 cases, of
course, there were no doubt many hundreds of others which had not
come to the attention of the police. Denver was thus experiencing
what-so far as the available literature reveals-was the earliest
of many similar local glue-sniffing epidemics throughout the
country. Denver police met the new peril in the usual way-by
escalating the warnings. In August 1959, Denver glue-sniffers had
been threatened merely with anemia and brain damage. In June 1960
a spokesman for Denver's juvenile Police Bureau was quoted as
saying: &quot;This practice is extremely dangerous, and a kid can
die from it if he gets too much.&quot; A second police spokesman
added that &quot;inhaling large quantities of the cement fumes
can lead to permanent injury of the respiratory system and could
cause death.&quot; And the head of the Police Crime Laboratory
warned: &quot;I'm afraid some kid will get hold of too much of
the stuff and we'll have a fatal case on our hands.&quot; 3 In
October 1961 a Denver police lieutenant was quoted as explaining
that glue fumes &quot;diminish the oxygen supply to the
blood&quot; and &quot;cause severe brain damage and death .&quot;
4 A representative in the state legislature warned that
glue-sniffing &quot;can </p>

<p>result in permanent damage to the brain.&quot; 5 In April 1962
Denver youngsters were warned that glue-sniffing causes
&quot;stimulation of the central nervous system, followed by
depression and often convulsions,&quot; and that &quot;it can
affect the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, skin, liver,
kidneys, heart and blood-depending on what type of glue is
used.&quot; 6 The headline over the June 1960 story presented the
two central themes which were later to characterize
anti-glue-sniffing propaganda in other cities as well: </p>

<p>COULD BE FATAL Plane Glue Gives Kids a Kick </p>

<p>Far from ending Denver's glue-sniffing epidemic, however,
these warnings were followed by a further spread of the epidemic.
The warnings seemed to function as lures. By October 23, 1961,
the chief probation officer of the Denver juvenile Court was able
to announce: &quot;We are averaging about 30 boys a month now on
this glue-sniffing problem.&quot; Worse yet, he added, the custom
was spreading from the high schools into the junior highs and
&quot;even into the grade schools.&quot; I A police spokesman
similarly announced that glue-sniffing, unknown 26 months
earlier, was now &quot;a major problem among juveniles in
Denver.&quot; He noted that 278 arrests were made for
glue-sniffing in 1961, as compared with only 95 in 1960.8 Nor was
the problem limited to Denver. Tom Adams, director of the state
reform school in Golden, Colorado, was quoted in October 1961:
&quot;Right now I have about 50 boys here because of this
glue-sniffing.&quot; 9 Since no city or state law against
glue-sniffing had yet been passed, the reporter who covered the
story felt called upon to explain how 278 arrests could be made
in 1961 for glue-sniffing and how 50 children could be
incarcerated in a reform school for the same offense. His
explanation, however, did not entirely clarify the mystery. All
he could say was that &quot;the youths are charged under juvenile
delinquency procedures when they are found sniffing glue.&quot; A
police spokesman added a detail: the 278 Denver arrests for
glue-sniffing were classed for statistical purposes as
&quot;drunkenness arrests.&quot;' Throughout 1960 and 1961,
Denver police made further headlines by periodic raids on
glue-sniffers. A typical 1961 example was headed: </p>

<p>* Readers should not be surprised at this development, for a
substantial proportion of arrests and incarcerations of juveniles
throughout the country are for actions which are not prohibited
by any law and which would not be crimes if indulged in by
adults. (See Ruth and Edward Brecher, The Delinquent and the Law,
Public Affairs Pamphlet No. 337 [New York: Public Affairs
Pamphlets, 1962]; also, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society,
A Report by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice [New York: Avon Books 1968], . 227-228.
</p>

<p>7 DENVER YOUTHS ARRESTED FOR DEADLY &quot;GLUE-SNIFFING&quot;
The story began: </p>

<p>Seven Denver teenagers were arrested over the weekend for
&quot;glue-sniffing,&quot; a new thrill-seeking activity that
juvenile authorities label &quot;extremely dangerous.&quot; Five
of the boys, four of them 16 and the other 17, are in City jail.
Two others, 13 and 14, were lodged in juvenile Hall. All seven
were arrested Sunday near the Curtis Park Recreation Center, 50th
and Curtis Sts., by Patrolmen Dale Nelson and Donald Smith.10 </p>

<p>Thus the broad pattern was established-the dramatic police
raids and the imprisonment of children and teenagers, accompanied
by dire warnings of physical and psychological damage. The next
element in the pattern was soon added: proposals for specific
antiglue legislation. On December 8, 1961, just six weeks after
the sensational Curtis Park police raid, the Denver papers
reported that State Representative Ben Klein, a former probation
officer, would &quot;propose to the January [1962] session of the
Colorado Legislature three new laws to deter youngsters from
sniffing airplane glue. . . .&quot; 11 Denver youngsters no doubt
noted the order of events: arrests and jailings first,
legislation later-a sequence unlikely to encourage respect for
law. In support of his three new laws, Representative Klein
quoted Denver's juvenile Court judge Philip Gilliam as saying
that he considered gluesniffing to be now &quot;the Number I
juvenile problem in the metropolitan area.&quot; Glue-sniffing
had achieved this preeminence within two and a half years after
the two writers in Empire had found no evidence of gluesniffing
in Denver. Representative Klein's three laws would make it an
offense (1) to sell glue to minors without parental consent, (2)
to drive a car while under the influence of glue, or (3) to sniff
glue. This last proposed offense was remarkable-for, as noted in
Part 1, it is not an offense to use even such drugs as heroin, in
Denver or elsewhere in the United States. Representative Klein
said his legislation would also require retailers &quot;to keep a
registry of sales . . . similar to the registry of sales of
narcotics drugs.&quot; Thus glue-sniffing was more or less subtly
linked with heroin. just as arrests for glue-sniffing were
followed by laws against gluesniffing, so medical warnings were
followed by medical studies designed to justify the warnings. A
study undertaken by Dr. Oliver Massengale, director of the
Adolescent Clinic at the University of Colorado Medical Center,
and Dr. Helen Glaser, assistant professor of pediatrics at the
university, was no doubt the first scientific research on the
recreational aspects of glue-sniffing in the history of the
medical sciences. </p>

<p>Dr. Massengale explained that he became interested in
glue-sniffing way back in 1960, when early newspaper reports of
glue-sniffing hazards had appeared. A mother almost in tears, he
recalled, had brought her son to his office. &quot;He's sniffing
glue,&quot; the mother declared. &quot;You've got to stop him
before he dies.&quot; A reporter for a Denver paper, in an
interview with Drs. Massengale and Glaser published April 29,
1962, cited these researchers as authority for the statement that
some types of plastic cement &quot;may cause damage to the liver,
kidneys and brain.&quot; 12 When the full text of the
Glaser-Massengale study was published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association for July 28, 1962, however, certain
details were added that the newspaper interview had neglected.
Cases of damage from glue all involved either the swallowing of
substantial amounts or else the continuous dayafter-day exposure
to high concentrations among workers in industrial plants.
&quot;Although a great deal of concern about the ill effects of
this practice is expressed by parents, school personnel, juvenile
authorities, and the children themselves,&quot; the medical
experts noted in the medical publication, &quot;very little is
actually known about possible damage to organ systems resulting
from deliberate inhalation of cement vapors. Many children share
the so far unsubstantiated belief that glue-sniffing produces
insanity and death, and we know of one case in which glue was
first used by an adolescent boy in an attempt to commit
suicide.&quot; 13 Drs. Glaser and Massengale then presented six
cases of juvenile Denver glue-sniffers. In none of them was any
physical damage attributable to glue-sniffing; and in none of
them was glue-sniffing the source of the child's psychological
problems. Case Number 1, for example, concerned an
eleven-year-old boy; &quot;his mother worked at night; his
parents were separated; and he had not seen his father for six
years.&quot; The mother of Case Number 2 &quot;was an alcoholic
and was possibly also psychotic. The parents were separated, and
the patient lived in a foster home, where he was unhappy.... He
was ... depressed, anxious, and fearful, and longing for
affectional security. Seeing the world as hostile and
pain-inflicting, he tended to withdraw into passive, immature
forms of behavior.&quot; Patient Number 3 was a fourteen-year-old
whose father had died when he was five, &quot;and he had been
taken out of the custody of his alcoholic mother but subsequently
had been returned to her. A few months before being seen in the
clinic the boy bad spent eight months in a reformatory because of
stealing.&quot; Case Number 5 was the boy who tried to commit
suicide by sniffing glue. &quot;This boy's father, possibly
acting out of a cultural pattern of insecurity and fear, was very
strict and rigid and was looked upon by the patient as a tyrant.
His mother was a weak, inadequate </p>

<p>person who sided with her son but was unable to rebel against
her husband in his behalf.&quot; Case Number 6 was a
fifteen-year-old; &quot;the patient's father, who had been very
strict and punitive, had died about six months before, and the
mother was finding her son increasingly unmanageable and
destructive. This boy had been in trouble even before his
father's death because of writing obscenities in school books,
running away, and joy-riding.&quot; 14 In all cases, the child's
problems and disturbances had antedated the glue-sniffing. just
what good was accomplished by arresting and incarcerating these
troubled youngsters for sniffing glue did not appear in the
study. It should be noted, moreover, that these were not typical
glue-sniffers. Rather they were typical of the small subsample of
glue-sniffers who were caught at it-arrested by the police and
referred to the university's adolescent clinic. The
Glaser-Massengale paper in the Journal of the American Medical
Association confirmed the incredible speed with which
glue-sniffing had spread following the first accounts in the mass
media: &quot;Glue sniffing, almost unheard of two years ago, has
become a serious threat in some communities. In the Denver area
it is considered by responsible juvenile authorities to be the
most serious problem they face currently in working with known
delinquents and other youngsters brought to the attention of the
court because of violations of the law.&quot;' The 130 Denver
children arrested in the two-year period for glue-sniffing
&quot;ranged in age from 7 through 17, with a mean age of 13
years, and all but 6 were boys.&quot;&quot; Eighty percent bad
Spanish surnames; this high incidence was perhaps due as much to
the arresting practices of the police as to the frequency of
glue-sniffing among those children. Glue-sniffing children in
middle-class white neighborhoods are customarily seen by
pediatricians in private practice. The remainder of the Denver
story need here be only briefly summarized through selected
newspaper items: </p>

<p>While Denver was in all probability the first city in the
world to suffer a major glue-sniffing epidemic, other cities soon
followed Denver's example. In New York City, for example, the New
York Times ran a story about glue-sniffing on October 6, 1961:
&quot;L.I. Youths Inhale Glue in Model Kits For Narcotic
Effect.&quot; 26 Other New York area newspapersand no doubt radio
and television stations as well-ran similar stories. As in
Denver, the New York stories stressed the hazards of
glue-sniffing. The initial New York Times story, after stating
that youngsters sniff glue to &quot;obtain a feeling of elation
similar to that of narcotics,&quot; and that youngsters who sniff
glue are &quot;found in seemingly drunken stupors,&quot; went on
to cite the Nassau County Health Department as authority for the
warning that toluene, the organic solvent most commonly used in
model airplane glue, &quot;dulls the brain when it is inhaled and
could kill a person. It can cause damage to the liver and bone
marrow if it is taken in small repeated doses. The chemical has
an irritating effect on the lungs and can cause pain, vomiting,
headaches, confusion, and ultimately coma. It can also cause the
heart to beat irregularly and can result in transient euphoria.
The lethal dose is unknown. No fatalities have been
recorded.&quot; These warnings, like the earlier Denver warnings,
seemed to be highly effective lures. Within fifteen months, New
York City police had made 778 arrests for glue-sniffing 27 and
the city authorities were seriously considering proposals to make
glue-sniffing illegal. In 1963, New York City arrests totaled
2,003.28 Many tens of thousands of others, of course, were no
doubt sniffing glue by then without coming to the attention of
the police. Salt Lake City was another city where local news
media publicized glue-sniffing early, and where the glue-sniffing
epidemic had an early start. Twelve boys, aged fourteen to
eighteen, were apprehended there for glue-sniffing and
interviewed in 1962; the interviews were of particular
significance in revealing the way in which glue-sniffing, which a
few years earlier was only one of a number of forms of sniffing,
had become the prime form of sniffing. &quot;Seven of the boys
bad previously inhaled the fumes of other substances, notably the
fumes of gasoline (6 boys), ether, </p>

<p>and nasal inhalers (one each), and one of these boys had been
smoking marijuana.&quot; Glue-sniffing had recently, however, far
outstripped the other sniffings, &quot;to the extent that in one
small town the practice was considered virtually universal among
boys. Girls, as yet, have not been widely involved.&quot; 29
Marijuana smoking did not catch up with glue-sniffing among
children until a major antimarijuana campaign was launched a
little later. The glue interests contributed notably to expanding
the anti-gluesniffing campaign from a local to a nationwide
phenomenon. As early as 1962 the Hobby Industry Association of
America, representing 1,100 industry members, announced that it
was spending $250,000 a year to combat glue-sniffing. &quot;To
help inform communities about the sniffing problem,&quot; the
Wall Street Journal announced on its front page on December 7,
1962, &quot;the Hobby Industry Association has produced a
15-minute color film 'The Scent of Danger,' which it soon will
release to local civic groups. The film describes the harm done
by glue sniffing and mentions other products, such as cleaning
fluid and nail polish, which also contain solvents that can cause
intoxication. It recommends that communities make it illegal to
sniff any substance with an intoxicating effect.&quot; 30 For
this the hobby industry won rewards of two kinds-public approval
for its dedication to the anti-glue-sniffing campaign, and a
marked rise in glue sales during the subsequent years. The early
anti-glue-sniffing laws were remarkable in several respects. One
of the first of them-perhaps the very first-was Ordinance Number
1722, passed by the City of Anaheim, California, on June 6, 1962.
This ordinance made it illegal for any person to &quot;inhale,
breathe, or drink any compound, liquid, chemical, or any
substance known as glue, adhesive cement, mucilage, dope, or
other material or substance or combination thereof, with the
intention of becoming intoxicated, elated, dazed, paralyzed,
irrational or in any manner changing, distorting or disturbing
the eyesight, thinking process, balance, or coordination of such
person .&quot; 31 Whiskey drinking was no doubt illegal under
this ordinance. A Maryland law enacted a little later was not
quite so broad; this statute made it &quot;unlawful for any
person under twenty-one years of age to deliberately smell or
inhale such excessive quantities of any narcotics, drugs, or any
other noxious substances or chemicals containing any ketones,
aldehydes, organic acetates, ether, chlorinated hydrocarbons or
any other substances containing solvents releasing toxic vapors,
as cause conditions of intoxication, inebriation, excitement,
stupefaction, or dulling of the brain and nervous system. . . .
Any person violating this section will be guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction thereof shall be fined . . . . 32 Why
glue-sniffing by adults aged twenty-one or older was exempted
from the Maryland law is not apparent. </p>

<p>Other cities and states passed laws restricting the sale of
glue in various ways-though this approach was opposed by the
Hobby Industry Association. At the beginning of 1968 the
Kupperstein-Susman bibliography listed 13 states and 29 counties
and municipalities that had already passed glue-sniffing laws;
additional states, counties, and municipalities had such laws
under consideration. The national news media contributed notably
to the glue-sniffing campaign. In its issue of February 16, 1962,
for example, the weekly news magazine Time carried an item headed
&quot;The New Kick,&quot; which declared: &quot;The newest kick
is glue-sniffing. A 14-year-old sniffer explains: 'You take a
tube of plastic glue, the kind squares use to make model
airplanes, and you squeeze it all out in a handkerchief, see.
Then you roll up the handkerchief into a sort of tube, put the
end in your mouth and breathe through it. It's simple and it's
cheap. It's quick, too. Man! , &quot; 33 As is customary, the
information about how to get high on glue was accompanied in Time
by ritual warnings-much as crime movies of the era, after
glorifying the heroic criminals, ended with their tragic deaths.
Time quoted Dr. Alan K. Done, director of Salt Lake City's Poison
Control Center, as saying: &quot;I have found definite evidence
of effects on the kidneys from glue sniffing. It is too soon to
know whether this effect is temporary or permanent damage .&quot;
34 Neither Time nor the other media, however, publicized the
findings of Dr. Massengale and his Denver associates indicating
that glue-sniffing did not produce kidney damage in Denver.
Newsweek followed on August 13, 1962, with a story entitled
&quot;The New Addicts.&quot; It began: </p>

<p>You're in outer space. You're Superman. You're floating in
air, seeing double, riding next to God. It's Kicksville. Are
these the fantasies of narcotics addicts on a pop? No. More
disturbingly, these hopped-up reactions are those of teenagers
hooked on goofballs, model airplane glue, and cough medicine.
Across the nation, police last week reported case after case of
this alarming trend.35 </p>

<p>In Miami, Newsweek noted, &quot;a 12-year-old boy, discovered
sniffing airplane glue by his father, snatched up a knife and
threatened to kill him.&quot; A police officer with the Miami
juvenile Bureau was then quoted as commenting: &quot;It's common
for the boys who sniff glue to become belligerent. They are
willing to take on a policeman twice their size.&quot; And
Newsweek added: &quot;Glue sniffers-while not physiologically
addictedcan do equal damage to their systems. Some of the
long-term effects [include] burned-out nose membranes, liver
damage, perforations of the gall bladder, destruction of bone
marrow, blindness, and possible death. But,&quot; Newsweek
cogently went on, &quot;this threat doesn't deter youngsters from
squeezing up to five tubes of glue daily into a paper bag and
breathing the fumes .&quot; 36 Consumer Reports, the magazine of
Consumers Union, also ran a warning against glue-sniffing-a bit
more restrained than the othersin January 1963. &quot;Although
there is as yet no documented evidence . . . &quot; the Consumer
Reports article cautiously noted, &quot;CU's medical consultants
are convinced that the inhalation of sufficient solvent vapors to
produce the mental effects the sniffers seek probably will also
produce damage to the liver, kidneys, respiratory organs, and
possibly other organs as well.&quot; 37 Even the Federal Bureau
of Investigation took a hand in the anti-gluesniffing campaign.
Its FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin for October 1965 carried an
article by Dr. Jacob Sokol, chief physician for the Los Angeles
County Probation Department, entitled &quot;A Sniff of
Death.&quot; The tenor of the article was summarized in the
subhead: &quot;Glue-sniffing-in all its horrifying and alarming
ramifications, mentally, physically, and medically -is discussed
by Dr. Sokol in plain, lay language. His report should be of the
utmost interest to law enforcement officers, parents, teachers,
civic leaders, and all persons concerned with the welfare and
health of young people .&quot; 38 The FBI Bulletin article,
moreover, cited a new argument by Dr. Sokol against
glue-sniffing: </p>

<p>Glue sniffers have described to me bow a number of children,
boys and girls, meet in unoccupied houses where they sniff glue
together and later have sexual relations-both homosexual and
heterosexual. To my knowledge this practice has not, however,
come to the attention of law enforcement agencies. Recently,
while conversing with deputy probation officers, I have been
informed that several episodes of homosexual relations have
occurred between adults and children under the influence of glue.
Some of these sexual perverts are encouraging the children to
sniff glue with the intensions of having homosexual relations
with them.&quot; </p>

<p>just where the &quot;sexual perverts&quot; got this idea of
giving children glue was not discussed; perhaps it was from
reading the anti-glue-sniffing campaigns in the mass media. To
end the glue menace, the FBI Bulletin article recommended seven
measures, including the following: &quot;I. We should arouse
public opinion as to the dangers of this practice.... &quot;7.
Legislation should be passed which would prohibit the sale of
glue containing certain toxic chemicals to persons under 21 years
of age.&quot; 40 One side effect of the anti-glue-sniffing
campaign, which continued throughout the 1960s, calls for special
mention. The campaign produced subtle changes in the relations of
parents and teachers to children. A child was now a suspect to be
spied upon lest he secretly be sniffing glue. Health departments
and other authoritative agencies encouraged this </p>

<p>espionage, and listed the symptoms adults should be on the
alert for: &quot;Parents suspecting or told that their children
have deliberately sniffed glue should take them to a doctor
without delay. &quot;Schoolteachers should note irritability,
inattentiveness, sleeping or loss of consciousness as symptoms of
glue sniffing.&quot; 41 The one voice of reason and common sense
amid the near-hysterical concern with glue-sniffing was found in
the Verhulst-Crotty bulletin issued by the National Clearinghouse
for Poison Control Centers, cited earlier. Summing up the
evidence from the studies of glue-sniffers reviewed by the
authors, the bulletin noted: </p>

<p>By speculation, projection, and imagination, one can ... build
up quite a case for the potential hazards of the repeated
inhalation of organic solvents such as those used in plastic
cements. It behooves us, however, to ascertain facts in this
regard. [One expert] inferred from his contact with a number of
boys who practice glue-sniffing that the boys could and would
give up the practice readily if they were convinced it was
dangerous. At the same time, however, it became evident that the
transparent misinformation or contradictory statements by
authorities concerning the dangers of these practices would be
completely disregarded by these boys and taken as evidence that
none of the information was true. It also became apparent that,
if the boys gave up glue-sniffing, they would take up other
habits which would provide a comparable effect. [One expert]
points out that, in our present state of knowledge, toluene (one
of the more commonly used solvents in plastic cements) is
considerably safer than many other organic solvents.42 </p>

<p>The mass media of the early 1960s were filled with reports of
deaths due to glue-sniffing. The Verhulst-Crotty bulletin tracked
down these reports and found a total of nine alleged
glue-sniffing deaths-each one reported many times. Six of the
nine were not due to glue fumes but to asphyxiation, which
occurred when the victim's head was covered by an airtight
plastic bag. A seventh death was probably also a plastic-bag
case. In an eighth case there was no evidence whatever that the
victim had been sniffing glue before his death, and no toluene
was found at autopsy. The last case was probably not due to
glue-sniffing; the victim had been ill and bad sniffed gasoline.
Thus among tens of thousands of glue-sniffers prior to 1964, no
death due unequivocally to glue vapor had as yet been reported.
The lifesaving advice children needed was not to sniff glue with
their heads in plastic bags. The Verbulst-Crotty bulletin also
reviewed behavioral effects of gluesniffing; children
unquestionably did all sorts of silly and potentially dangerous
things when high on glue much the same things they would have
done if drunk on alcohol. Those bulletins, unfortunately, were
distributed in mimeographed form to only a short list of
recipients. They had no visible effect on the nationwide
anti-glue-sniffing campaign. </p>

<p>The toxicology of recreational solvent-sniffing at this
writing remains very much where it was at the time of the 1964
Verhulst-Crotty summary. No one is prepared to say that
occasional solvent sniffing is safe, and some studies suggest
that frequent sniffing may be moderately harmful. Later in the
decade, it was widely observed that young people paid little or
no attention to dire warnings against the hazards of marijuana
smoking, LSD-using, and other forms of drug use. It seems highly
likely, in retrospect, that the exaggerated warnings against
glue-sniffing were among the factors desensitizing some young
people to drug warnings in general. Most teenagers knew of others
in their own neighborhoods who had sniffed glue repeatedly, and
who did not drop dead or go to the hospital with brain damage,
kidney damage, or liver damage. Children may be ignorant, but
they are not stupid. When the evidence of their own experience
contradicts adult propaganda, they (like sensible adults) rely on
their own experience-and tend to distrust in the future a source
of information which they had found unreliable in the past. The
nationwide anti-glue-sniffing campaign, it should be noted,
preceded the anti-LSD campaign, to be described later, and in
part set the model for it. The anti-LSD campaign, like the
antiglue campaign, featured solemn warnings of dire damage, laws
against LSD, sensational police raids, scientific studies
demonstrating hazards-and an endless bombardment of publicity
concerning all of these other factors. Both campaigns were
followed by increased use of the drugs attacked. There was also
one difference. In the case of LSD (see Chapter 50), the drug was
popularized through the simultaneous efforts of LSD enthusiasts
and LSD enemies. But glue-sniffing had no Timothy Leary to
advertise and praise it. The enemies of glue-sniffing popularized
the custom all by themselves. At the beginning of the decade,
gasoline sniffing was the most common form of organic solvent
inhalation. Paint-thinner sniffing, varnish-remover sniffing,
cigarette-lighter-fluid sniffing, glue-sniffing, and the others
were not-very-common phenomena to which no one paid much
attention. So far as can be determined, gasoline sniffing at the
end of the 1960s was neither more nor less popular than at the
beginning. The same was true of the sniffing of other readily
available organic solvents. Only glue-sniffing was the target of
a nationwide campaign-and only gluesniffing became a popular
youth pastime. It seems clear that the damage done by the arrests
and imprisonments of children for glue-sniffing during the 1960s
far exceeded the damage done by glue-sniffing during that sorry
decade-and served to popularize rather than to discourage the
practice. Just how popular it became, many recent surveys reveal.
</p>

<p>In 1969, 1,348 high-school seniors in Montgomery County,
Maryland, filled out a drug-use questionnaire. Of these, 7.4
percent stated that they had sniffed glue, and 1.0 percent
described themselves as current gluesniffers. Similarly, among
1,429 Montgomery County junior-high-school students, 6.6 percent
reported that they had sniffed glue.43 Among 781 sophomores,
juniors, and seniors in five high schools in Madison, Wisconsin,
filling out a questionnaire in 1969, 5.1 percent stated that they
had sniffed glue. The replies indicated that 0.8 percent sniffed
glue frequently, 1.0 percent sniffed glue infrequently, and the
remaining 3.3 percent had sniffed glue only once or twice .44
Among 47,182 students in Utah high schools and junior highs
answering a questionnaire in 1969, 7.1 percent reported that they
had at some time sniffed glue; 9.5 percent of the boys and 4.8
percent of the girls had sniffed. Among the boys, 3.5 percent had
sniffed only once, 3.8 percent had sniffed several times, and 2.2
percent had sniffed more than 10 times. The returns indicated
that 1.8 percent of the boys and 0.9 percent of the girls had
sniffed glue within the past few weeks.45 Among 1,379 high-school
seniors in 11 selected Michigan high schools in 1968, 8.1 percent
in one school reported glue-sniffing, as compared with 7.0
percent in another, 4.7 percent in a third, and none at all in
two small high schools.46 Among 1,225 students at Mamaroneck (New
York) Senior High School answering a questionnaire in 1967, 6.1
percent reported having sniffed glue and 2.0 percent had sniffed
glue more than once. Among 1,294 Mamaroneck junior High School
students, 8.3 percent reported having sniffed glue, and 1.4
percent had sniffed glue more than once .47 These and other
similar surveys suggest that at a rough estimate, at least 5
percent of all young Americans graduating from high school
perhaps 150,000 in each annual cohort-have sniffed glue at least
once. This level of use can be contrasted with the level before
1959, when glue sniffing was essentially unknown and
unpublicized. </p>

<p>On July 20, 1971, the New York Times heralded yet another
nationwide campaign against yet another inhalant menace with a
front-page headline: </p>

<p>AEROSOL SNIFFING: NEW AND DEADLY CRAZE </p>

<p>The story, by Grace Lichtenstein, echoed closely the kickoff
of the antiglue-sniffing campaign a decade earlier:
&quot;Physicians, government officials, drug experts and chemical
manufacturers are growing increasingly worried about a deadly and
relatively new drug-abuse problem among the nation's children:
the inhalation of aerosol sprays.&quot; As in the earlier stories
about glue-sniffing, precise details were sup- </p>

<p>plied on how to get high on aerosols: &quot;The aerosol
product-hair spray, deodorant, household cleaners or some
other-is sprayed into a paper bag or balloon and then inhaled
because the propellant produces a strange, floating kind of
high.&quot; There followed the usual warnings of disastrous
effects: </p>

<p>According to the Food and Drug Administration, more than 100
youths have died from deliberate aerosol sniffing since 1967,
with an average of four deaths a month currently being recorded.
. . . It appears that death occurs after a youngster deeply
inhales an aerosol spray for a prolonged period, either on a
single occasion or on several occasions. The fluorocarbon
propellant Freon, the best-known brand of fluorocarbon, can make
the heart beat irregularly and then stop. </p>

<p>An expert was quoted as adding: &quot;Once the final event
begins, it's quick, sudden, and irreversible.&quot; 48 </p>

<p>An earlier round of aerosol inhaling by children, the story
noted, had centered around a spray-on product used to chill
cocktail glasses. This product had therefore been removed from
the market. Little was accomplished, however, for &quot;experts
stress that any of the 300 kinds of aerosol products now on the
market can be equally abused because all use similar
propellants.&quot; Like the glue industry in the earlier
glue-sniffing campaign, the aerosol industry entered the
aerosol-sniffing campaign through an &quot;Inter-Industry
Committee on Aerosol Use.&quot; &quot;The campaign includes a
filmstrip, 'Rap On,' that has been distributed to 3,000 school
districts. The industry has also put out a booklet, 'Will Death
Come Without Warning?' which declares that aerosol products are
safe when used as directed.&quot; &quot;They're really trying
awfully hard,&quot; said B. J. Burkett, spokesman for the
Inter-Industry Committee and public relations manager of the
Freon Products Division of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
There was as yet no suggestion that aerosol sniffing be made a
criminal offense; but laws were being proposed to require a
warning-perhaps even a skull-and-crossbones-on the label of all
aerosol products. Such measures, however, had been decided
against as of this writing. But, one might wonder: Here we go
again?' </p>

<p>* The first effort to repress the recreational use of nitrous
oxide (laughing gas) was also instituted in 1971. Psychiatric
News reported: &quot;Strict regulations have been placed on the
distribution and sale of nitrous oxide in Maryland by Dr. Neil
Solomon, state following reports that the gas is being used by
some young people as an inhalant to produce an exhilarating
effect. This is the first regulatory action in the nation
concerning improper use of nitrous oxide, according to
information from the Food and Drug Administration. . . .&quot; 49

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p><b>by McGeorge Bundy</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This report grew out of an effort by the Ford Foundation to
understand the massive and complex problem of drug abuse in the
United States and to determine the most effective ways in which
the Foundation might contribute to efforts to deal with the
problem. </p>

<p>Like many institutions working in such fields as education and
poverty, we encountered the growing blight of drug abuse
increasingly in the 1960's. The Foundation made a number of
grants to projects that dealt with drug abuse as an aspect of a
larger problem, as in work with high school students, faculty,
and parents to understand and overcome the alienation of youth.
As drug abuse increased, however, the Foundation considered
whether it might undertake a larger program. The study that led
to this report, undertaken in mid-1970, was the first step in
that consideration. </p>

<p>The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council. The four foundations
have now committed substantial funds for the first several years
of the Council's work. </p>

<p>The functions of the Drug Abuse Council will include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Analysis of the development and results of public
        policies in the drug-abuse field </li>
    <li>Dissemination to the public of accurate data on the
        causes, extent, and treatment of drug abuse </li>
    <li>Promotion of needed research </li>
    <li>Synthesis and distribution of available information in
        research and treatment </li>
    <li>Evaluation of treatment and education programs </li>
</ul>

<p>Details of the Council's composition and plans are expected to
be announced shortly after this manuscript goes to press. </p>

<p>The report leading to the establishment of the Council-the
work of an outstanding independent task force of lawyers,
scientists, and other investigators-identified four major problem
areas in the drug-abuse field: heroin addiction in urban
ghettoes; drug experimentation by the young; overuse of legal
stimulants and tranquilizers; and the use of drugs to control
deviant behavior, especially among children. </p>

<p>The task-force report was intended principally for the Ford
Foundation's guidance. Yet, the scope and quality of the work
were such that the Foundation shared the first draft, in
December, 1970, with legal, scientific, and governmental
authorities active in efforts to control and prevent drug abuse.
The reaction to the report was strongly affirmative. The report
was praised for its thorough, clear, and sober analysis, and a
number of authorities urged the Foundation to make it available
to a wider audience. Accordingly, the Foundation asked the staff
of the developing Drug Abuse Council. to bring up to date those
sections dealing with aspects of the problem in which there had
been substantial change since the first draft was prepared. We
believe that this revised, expanded, and updated report is both a
forerunner and the first product of the Drug Abuse Council. As
such, we believe it is a promising harbinger of other
contributions the Council may make, both in understanding this
spreading danger to American society and in helping to curb it. </p>

<p>We hope that the report will be useful to the public at large
as well as to specialists, for the drug-abuse problem is so broad
and complex that effective efforts to overcome it will demand the
understanding and support of as many Americans as possible. <br>

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse</h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April, 1970, the Ford Foundation asked us to undertake a
broad survey of the drug-abuse problem in this country and to
report back by the end of the year on what activities private
foundations might usefully undertake in this field. During May to
December, 1970, we had the opportunity to review the drug-abuse
field, both through a study of the literature and through
extensive interviews. The report was completed by December 1,
1970, and submitted to several foundations for their
consideration. </p>

<p>We did not anticipate making any startling new discoveries in
this field, and, in fact, we have made none. We cannot say that
there is a magic solution to the problem of drug abuse. Rapid or
remarkable results in this area cannot be promised. Alleviation
of local and national drug-abuse problems will come, in our
judgment, through a slow and painful process of social change and
accommodation. Insofar as our report can help to establish the
mechanisms by which such change and accommodation may begin, and
even be accelerated, it will have more than served its intended
purpose. </p>

<p>The report is reproduced here without change. Although we have
added occasional footnotes to indicate significant developments
since December, 1970, we have concluded that any attempt to take
note of every factual change would be both futile and
unnecessary. Suffice it to say that developments during the past
year have only underscored the thrust of the original report. </p>

<p>Appendixes to the main report were developed largely by the
project staff both during 1970 and after the report itself was
completed and submitted to the foundations, in order to record
some of the more detailed information gathered in the course of
the survey. These staff papers may be considered current as of
about September, 1971. Although they do not always represent a
consensus of the project participants, they do make a useful
contribution to knowledge and discussion in the field. </p>

<p>It is not possible to name all of those to whom we are
indebted for assistance with the survey and the report. We spoke
to hundreds of people throughout the country, all of whom
generously provided time and material. The trustees, officers,
and staff of the Ford Foundation provided complete freedom for
this inquiry, together with ample financial support. We are
especially indebted to Mitchell Sviridoff and Thomas Wright for
their personal involvement. The Carnegie Corporation, the
Commonwealth Fund, and the Kaiser Foundation have been most
encouraging in their consideration of the report, as have
numerous other foundations and organizations. </p>

<p>We could not have undertaken the work involved in this survey
or completed the report without the strong support of James V.
DeLong, the only professional staff member who worked on the
project from beginning to end. His tenacity in ferreting out the
types of elusive facts on which any useful report must inevitably
rely, and his detailed and repeated review of the work product
have won him the respect of the entire drug-abuse field. We would
also like to give special thanks to Peter Wilson, who was with
the project during the first hectic period. </p>

<p>Substantial support in the form of time and resources was
freely donated by the Washington law firm of Covington &amp;
Burling. We also wish to thank the support staff-Meg Gleason,
Jacqueline Volpe, Angela Corley, Joan Henderson, Janine Yunker,
and Lilly Smith-for their skill and patience in finding and
keeping track of material and in preparing and revising endless
drafts. </p>

<p>Finally, we are gratified by the announcement that the Drug
Abuse Council proposed in the report has been established and is
beginning operations. We wish its new President, Thomas E.
Bryant, M.D., and the Chairman of its Board, Bethuel M. Webster,
success in bringing this new venture to fruition.<br>

<h1>Dealing with Drug Abuse </h1>

<p><b>A Report to the Ford Foundation</b> </p>

<p>THE DRUG ABUSE SURVEY PROJECT </p>

<h2>Summary of Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations </h2>

<p>by Patricia M. Wald and Peter Barton Hutt </p>

<hr>

<p><b>The Present Problem and Efforts to Control It </b></p>

<p><b>A More Promising Approach to Drug Abuse </b></p>

<p><b>The Drug Abuse Council</b> </p>

<p>This report, which summarizes the results of the Drug Abuse
Survey Project, is based upon extensive reading and numerous
interviews with workers in the field throughout the country. </p>

<p>Part I describes the present drug-abuse problem in this
country and what is currently being done to control it. Part 11
summarizes the project's views on a more promising approach to
drug-abuse problems. Part III sets forth the project's
recommendations for private foundation activity in this field. </p>

<p>Two preliminary observations are essential to this discussion.
First, in many aspects of this field, important basic facts have
not yet been determined and perhaps cannot be determined in the
near future; conclusions, therefore, depend on fragmentary
information and primarily on judgment. Because of the emotional
and moral attitudes involved in drug issues, conclusions differ
widely among individuals and are strongly and deeply held.
Secondly, even where facts exist, experts in the field often
disagree on their meaning and significance. We have found few
areas in which there is not widespread disagreement. </p>

<p>As a result, in arriving at the project's conclusions and
recommendations, we have relied strongly on the judgment of the
Cochairmen and the Executive Director. It should be understood
that at least one recognized expert could readily be found to
challenge, perhaps vehemently, virtually any statement we make or
might make. It appears that there can be no such thing as
consensus or a noncontroversial report on drug abuse. </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>THE PRESENT PROBLEM AND EFFORTS TO CONTROL
IT</b></font> </p>

<p><b>THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>Staff Report I describes the characteristics of the most
common drugs of abuse. For purposes of this report, such socially
accepted and legal drugs as alcohol and nicotine have been
excluded, and &quot;drug abuse&quot; has been limited primarily
to heroin, marijuana, stimulant and depressant drugs, and
hallucinogens. </p>

<p>The effects of a drug, the pattern of drug use, the prognosis
for the user, and the bases of social concern all vary widely
depending on the drug used, the age and class of the user, and
the circumstances. No categorization, therefore, is totally
satisfactory. The four core problems, however, have been broadly
delineated by many commentators as: (1) the use of heroin in
urban poverty areas, (2) experimentation with a wide variety of
drugs by the young, (3) the use of drugs by middle-aged and older
persons as a form of quasi-self-medication, and (4) the use of
drugs as a behavior-control device. </p>

<p>Heroin in Urban Poverty Areas. According to our best
estimates, there were, as of November, 1970, approximately
150,000 to 250,000 active heroin addicts in the United States.'
(Some estimates run as high as 300,000 heroin addicts in New York
City and 600,000 nationally, but these figures have little
support.) The addicts are heavily concentrated in the poorest
areas of large metropolitan areas. Probably half live in New
York, and 60 to 70 per cent of them are black, Puerto Rican, or
Mexican-American. Almost 85 per cent are male. </p>

<p>These figures represent people who use heroin on a daily
basis, injecting a dose every six to eight hours as the effect of
the previous dose wears off. They may spend anywhere from $10 to
$100 per day on heroin, depending on their dosage and tolerance,
their economic ability to sustain the habit, the purity of the
drug bought, and the price level of the city in which they live. </p>

<p>There is an additional, though unknown, population that uses
heroin only occasionally, either alone or as part of a pattern of
multiple drug use. The size of this group is a matter of
conjecture and debate. Some experts believe that repetitive use
of heroin leads inexorably to addiction, whereas others believe
that there is a substantial number of intermittent users who do
not become addicted. </p>

<p>It is not possible to resolve this issue definitively. It
seems probable, however, that a large number of persons have
experimented with heroin a few times without becoming addicted.
Heroin is easily available in the slum areas of most major
cities. Although a large habit is expensive, a single dose is
cheap ($1 or less for a capsule containing about I mg. of heroin
in Washington, D.C.), and the unit of sale in many places is so
small that a neophyte can take it without much fear of an
overdose. It seems likely that a large percentage of the young
black males in any large urban lower-class area have tried
heroin. The majority who have experimented with it have not
become addicted. And, although the potency of heroin makes it
difficult to believe that large numbers of intermittent users
never become addicted, this possibility cannot be ruled out on
the basis of present information. </p>

<p>Although heroin is a primary drug for the addict, multiple
drug use is exceedingly common. According to some studies,
between 40 and 60 per cent of the addicts use one of the
amphetamines or barbiturates as a secondary drug on a regular
basis. Cocaine, a strong nonaddictive stimulant, is also used
widely. </p>

<p>The tremendous wave of concern about heroin that has swept the
country appears to be caused primarily by the fear of crime
associated with addiction. Heroin itself does not cause criminal
behavior in any physiological or psychological sense, but the
need to maintain an expensive habit often does. A heroin addict
will do almost anything to obtain money to buy the drug. There is
virtually no way in which a poor, black, unskilled youth can earn
legally the $30 per day that is required for the average habit.
To maintain his addiction, he can deal in drugs, engage in
consensual crime, or steal. It is reasonable to estimate that
addicts steal between $1 billion and $2 billion in merchandise
per year. Estimates of thefts in New York City alone range from a
low of $.25 billion to a high of $1.9 billion. There is some
evidence that up to 50 per cent of property crimes in the major
metropolitan areas with a serious heroin addiction problem are
committed by addicts. On the other hand, there is evidence that
most addicts engaged in crime before they became addicted.
Addiction, therefore, cannot necessarily be regarded as the cause
of a criminal life-style, although it unquestionably intensifies
criminal activity. </p>

<p>A secondary cause of the current concern about heroin is the
fear that it has, or will, spread throughout society. While
heroin is undoubtedly now available in the suburbs, there is
little evidence that it represents a substantial problem there.
It remains largely a lower-class drug. </p>

<p>A third cause commonly cited for the concern about heroin is
fear of the effects of the drug on the user. Actually, there is
no proof that heroin itself causes any organic damage to the body
or brain similar, for example, to the extensive damage caused by
alcohol. Death through overdose has been attributed by medical
experts to the fact that heroin is a powerful nervous-system
suppressant that may cause respiration to cease when the dosage
exceeds the individual's tolerance, or to the fact that some
individuals may experience a severe allergic reaction to heroin. </p>

<p>It seems possible that many addicts would function normally if
given a steady supply of good-quality drugs. The real harm to
users is that they presently tend to become social dropouts, in
that the illegal status of the drug causes them to spend all
their time obtaining and using it. There seems little doubt that,
if it were not for the fear of crime and the spread of heroin to
the suburbs, most of society would not be seriously worried about
heroin addiction. </p>

<p>Youthful Drug Experimentation. Within the last five years
there has been a substantial increase in the use of illicit
nonopiate drugs by the young, particularly among middle-class
college and high school students and young military personnel.
The prevalent drugs of abuse for this group are marijuana (and,
to some extent, the more potent cannabis product, hashish), oral
amphetamines and barbiturates, LSD, and other hallucinogens.
During 1971 the use of heroin by GI's in Vietnam became, for the
first time, a matter of grave public concern. </p>

<p>As of November, 1971, the best estimates are that 15 million
people in this country have experimented with marijuana. Possibly
30 per cent of these go on to become occasional users, and 5 per
cent become frequent users. While these estimates are very
uncertain, survey research supports the conclusion that marijuana
use has spread fantastically in the last few years. One survey of
200 colleges found that 47 per cent of those interviewed had
smoked it 34 per cent occasionally and 13 per cent frequently.
There are major differences among colleges, of course. Other
surveys found that 70 per cent of the student body at one medical
school were current users of marijuana, as compared with 44 per
cent and 5 per cent at two other medical schools. Extrapolating
from available statistics, it is likely that 20 per cent of all
Americans between the ages of. 15 and 35 have used marijuana at
least once -a crime for which they could have been imprisoned by
the federal government for up to ten years.' </p>

<p>There is currently little evidence that marijuana causes
physical harm. The federal government is now engaged in a crash
research program to find out the short- and long-term effects of
marijuana. Critics of this research program argue that it is
intended simply to justify current federal policy and is not a
sound independent scientific investigation. Even persons who are
sympathetic to marijuana use will be surprised, however, if it is
discovered that marijuana use in large amounts over a long period
of time is totally harmless. The real issue over marijuana
appears to be not whether it causes mild physical damage but
whether its use has already spread so widely that, as is true of
alcohol, the social costs of efforts to prohibit it exceed the
physical costs that would be incurred by eliminating criminal
penalties for, or even legalizing, its use.' </p>

<p>Experimentation with oral amphetamines and barbiturate drugs,
all of which have recognized medical uses and are therefore often
easily obtainable, is probably second only to the use of
marijuana. Some 18 per cent of the students in the 200-campus
survey had tried amphetamines, and 15 per cent had tried
barbiturates, but only 2 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively,
had used them frequently. There are no more reliable estimates
available. </p>

<p>A quite dangerous pattern of middle-class youthful amphetamine
drug use is the injectable methamphetamine (&quot;speed&quot;)
Culture. Intravenous injections of methamphetamine usually take
the form of continuous use of massive doses for several days.
Users may become psychotic while under its influence, and it is
probably the drug most likely to lead directly to violence. There
is some evidence that it causes serious organic damage. Speed
also tends to make the user lose interest in food, sleep, and
hygiene. Because of these extreme effects, a speed
&quot;run&quot; is hard to sustain over any length of time, and
the end of a period of heavy speed use-the
&quot;crash&quot;-produces serious depression. Users have learned
over time that they can make the crash smoother by taking
barbiturates or heroin. Reports from San Francisco, the first
city to have a sizable speed culture, are that heroin is becoming
the drug of choice for a large proportion of former speed users
because it is a more pleasant &quot;down&quot; than the
barbiturates. </p>

<p>The use of LSD originally peaked in about 1967, declined
briefly, and then started to increase again as the early reports
about genetic damage caused by the drug were discredited and as
use spread downward into the high schools. The survey that found
marijuana use among 47 per cent of college students on 200
campuses found that 11 per cent had used LSD, but only I per cent
used it frequently. The National Institute of Mental Health had
earlier reported surveys showing a 2 to 9 per cent range of LSD
use among college students, with an over-all average of 5 per
cent. While a ratio of one LSD experimenter to every five triers
of marijuana seems too high for the population at large, or even
for most colleges and high schools, it does illustrate a higher
rate of current usage than has been suspected. </p>

<p>There is general agreement that LSD is a powerful drug that
should be used with care. In clinical use, severe reactions are
rare. One study found that 25,000 administrations of LSD or
mescaline to 5,000 people resulted in serious complications in
only 0.08 per cent of experimental subjects and 0.34 per cent of
subjects who were undergoing therapy. There is no scientific
certainty concerning other types of reaction that have been
alleged, but not proved, to result from LSD use, such as
flashbacks and birth defects. The long-term effects are not
known. </p>

<p>Youthful . experimentation may also involve heroin, especially
in the ghetto. A recent survey of juvenile addicts in Washington,
D.C., showed that over half started directly by mainlining heroin
rather than first using other drugs. Among middle-class youth,
however, experimentation with marijuana predominates, and heroin
is probably the least used drug. </p>

<p>Youthful middle-class experimentation with heroin as part of a
pattern of multidrug use does appear to be increasing. This
phenomenon is too new, and information is too fragmentary, to
judge whether it represents the beginnings of significant growth
in middle-class addiction. Preliminary reports indicate that
people who become involved with heroin in this non-ghetto context
have less tendency toward heavy involvement. </p>

<p>The extent of penetration of drugs other than marijuana is
difficult to assess. Considerably fewer young people seem to have
tried oral doses of amphetamines and barbiturates than have tried
marijuana, but more appear to have tried them than have tried
LSD. The number of young people who become heavily involved with
amphetamines (especially injectable methamphetamine) and
barbiturates is unknown but is probably of about the same
magnitude as those heavily involved with LSD. </p>

<p>Society's current concern about youthful drug experimentation
is often attributed to the possible detrimental effect on the
health of drug users. Certainly, concern about the potential harm
from heroin experimentation in the ghetto is far more justified
than concern about marijuana experimentation in the suburbs. It
is our judgment, however, that physical harm is actually only a
partial cause of this public concern. There are, after all, up to
9 million alcoholics, whose alcohol abuse affects a total of well
over 30 million people in this country, a far larger number than
are affected by drug abuse; yet, this enormous health problem has
created relatively little public concern. </p>

<p>Rather, the principal force behind the present public concern
about youthful middle-class experimentation seems to relate to
differences in perceptions and life-styles between older and
younger generations. Older persons tend to accept the use of
drugs only for therapeutic purposes. They do not regard alcohol
and nicotine as &quot;drugs&quot; and believe that the substances
can be properly used for social and personal pleasure. But the
older generation regards the use of drugs, such as marijuana and
LSD, for social and personal pleasure as symptomatic of
disrespect for law and authority and as an attempt to escape
responsibility. In contrast, many in the younger generation tend
to regard the use of drugs for social and personal pleasure as
entirely proper. Use of such drugs as marijuana and LSD is
therefore viewed by them as an opportunity for enhancement of
personal experience, an act of social custom within a peer group,
or a mark of youthful rebellion and independence similar to
smoking weeds or sipping beer behind the barn fifty years ago. </p>

<p>Drug Use among the Middle-aged and Elderly. Millions of people
use psychoactive drugs as a way of coping with the tensions and
problems of everyday living. Current estimates are vague, but in
a 1967 survey 25 per cent of all persons over 18 reported use of
a psychoactive drug during the preceding year. The number of
persons reporting use of a tranquilizer at some time in their
lives rose from 7 per cent in 1957 to 27 per cent in 1967.
American industry apparently produces about 4 billion dosage
units of barbiturates (not including other major and minor
tranquilizers) and 8 billion dosage units of amphetamines each
year. It is charged that half of these are diverted to the
illegal market at some point, and an unknown proportion of the
rest are prescribed carelessly. Some of these drugs are used by
heroin addicts and youthful experimenters. Most are not so used,
however, and the problem of self-prescribed use of these drugs is
one that pervades all strata of society. (In addition, about 10
per cent of the 80 million people who use alcohol have a serious
problem of dependence.) </p>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is now
conducting a series of comprehensive drug-use surveys, which
should provide an accurate picture of the extent of middle-age
and elderly drug abuse with legal as well as illegal drugs. The
project includes research into the frequency and situational
aspects of this problem. </p>

<p>Why certain persons become dependent on these drugs is not
clear. As in the case of heroin addiction, there is considerable
debate as to what physiological and psychological factors are
involved. </p>

<p>The personal costs of this type of drug abuse can be very
high. Of all the potential drugs of abuse, alcohol is one of the
most damaging, since even relatively light consumption clearly
causes some damage to such organs as the brain and liver, and
heavy consumption causes serious damage and sometimes death.
Barbiturates cause damage very similar to that caused by alcohol,
and, in the formal literature, these two drugs are regarded as
essentially additive and interchangeable in chronic intoxication.
With barbiturates, as well as alcohol, there is a serious risk of
lethal overdose. The personal costs of steady amphetamine use are
not clear. Experts believe that large doses entail a high risk of
organic damage. There appears to be no clear evidence concerning
smaller doses. </p>

<p>The social costs of alcoholism are now fairly well known and
need not be detailed here, but the social costs of the abuse of
barbiturates and amphetamines are still largely unknown. The
social benefits attributable to these drugs are equally
uncertain. There is clearly a widely felt need for the particular
effects of the various drugs. It is far from clear that
elimination of this form of drug abuse would result in net
benefits to the society, because one cannot be sure that other
possible responses to life situations would be less harmful. It
is possible that reducing the use of tranquilizers would result
in a rise of the violent crime rate, or in the divorce rate, or
in child beating. It almost certainly would require greater
institutionalization of persons with borderline emotional
problems. </p>

<p>Drugs in Behavior Control. A fourth emerging problem is the
overprescription of drugs to control the behavior of captive
populations, such as overactive school children and nursing-home
residents, where other, nondrug methods of control should
properly be used instead. Recent information has revealed
significant use of amphetamines to calm down behavior in the
classrooms of urban public schools. At the other end of the age
spectrum, tranquilizers are reportedly being used far too
extensively on elderly patients in nursing homes to keep them
from clamoring for the attention of overworked attendants. </p>

<p>These drugs are properly used, within limits of sound medical
practice approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for
hyper-kinetic children and elderly patients with emotional
problems. There is a serious danger, however, that they may be
used as a simple method of managing school children,
institutionalized patients, and correctional inmates as a
substitute for a competent staff and the other resources needed
in dealing with those not able to care for themselves. And, as
the range of behavior-controlling drugs becomes wider, we can
anticipate even greater problems in their use in unwarranted
situations. </p>

<p><b>BASIC RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>Existing Research. Most of the basic research now being done
on drugs of abuse is conducted by the NIMH Addiction Research
Center (ARC) at Lexington, Kentucky, or conducted or financed by
grant or contract through the NIMH Division of Narcotic Addiction
and Drug Abuse and the NIMH Division of Psycbopharmacology. </p>

<p>ARC is an interdisciplinary group doing basic research on the
physiological effects of a number of drugs of abuse, and one of
the very few to our knowledge that has recently conducted any
research with heroin. Its 1970 budget is about $.8 million. Its
principal functions are research on the abuse potential of drugs
and on opiate antagonists. ARC would need far more personnel,
ranging from senior research scientists to technicians and
paraprofessionals, and far more funds if it were to expand its
activities broadly to include basic research on the cause and
nature of all drug abuse and drug dependence. </p>

<p>NIMH funds for intramural and extramural research relating to
drug abuse have increased threefold in five years.' The figures
below include research in pharmacology, sociology, psychology, <br>
</p>

<p>Year Budget Authority </p>

<p>(1,000,000) </p>

<p>1966 6.4 </p>

<p>1967 10.6 </p>

<p>1968 13.3 </p>

<p>1969 14.1 </p>

<p>1970 16.3 </p>

<p>1971 18.3 </p>

<p>TOTAL: $79.0<br>
</p>

<p>and many other areas. They also apparently include at least
some of the research on psychoactive drugs sponsored by the NIMH
Division of Psychopharmacology, which is interested primarily in
the use of drugs in the treatment of mental disorders. </p>

<p>The research funds are dispersed among the various drugs of
abuse, not concentrated on one or two. For 1970, the only year
for which we now have information, the division by drugs was as
follows: </p>

<p>Drugs Allocation </p>

<p>000,000) </p>

<p>Opiates 3.8 </p>

<p>Marijuana 2.3 </p>

<p>Hallucinogens 1.8 </p>

<p>Barbiturates 5.3 </p>

<p>Amphetamines 2.8 </p>

<p>Other .3 </p>

<p>TOTAL: $16.3 </p>

<p>NIMH is unable to provide either a dollar breakdown on the
types of research represented (pharmacology, sociology, etc.) or
a breakdown by drug for previous years. In 1970, $1.3 million of
the money spent on marijuana research was dispersed through
special contracts. ARC received $.8 million of the money
designated for opiate research to operate its program. An
undeterminable amount is spent by the Division of
Psychopharmacology and other parts of NIMH.' The balance of
research expenditures represents about 50 grants to specific
individuals and institutions given on application. </p>

<p>The allocation of grant resources is determined primarily by
an advisory committee of physical and social scientists that
reviews all applications for funding and assigns them a priority
ranking on the basis of scientific merit. While NIMH
administrators have some authority to overrule the committee
(they can fund a low priority project instead of a high-priority
one, but they cannot fund a project if the committee refuses to
assign it any priority at all), we have been informed that this
happens rarely. </p>

<p>We have also been informed that little or no effort is made to
create a program of research. Applications are reviewed in a
vacuum. Consideration is not given to the importance or relevance
of the research to policy issues or to major scientific and
medical questions, or to alternative uses of the research budget.
The results of prior projects are reportedly not made available
to the committee for its consideration in reviewing current grant
applications. No significant effort is made to encourage grant
applications in areas of particular interest to scientists,
physicians, and the government. </p>

<p>The Justice Department's Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs (BNDD) has engaged in some research in the past and still
has some ongoing efforts on the abuse potential of drugs, the
sociology of drug use, the characteristics of dealers, and the
market structure of the drug traffic. The decision has recently
been made, however, that BNDD's research role is to be limited to
subjects related to law enforcement. </p>

<p>A major problem with basic research conducted or funded by the
federal government is that it is necessarily limited by
governmental policy. Thus, as might be expected, there are large
gaps in our basic knowledge about drugs of abuse. In particular,
basic experimentation with the effects of heroin on chronic
heroin addicts has been virtually ignored in view of the strong
federal policy against any such research. Until very recently,
federal policy also virtually precluded marijuana research in
humans. Federal regulations single out LSD and a handful of other
hallucinogens, from among all known drugs, as requiring specific
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an Investigational
New Drug Plan (rather than just filing the plan, as is true for
all other drugs) before clinical investigation may begin. Under
the 1970 federal drug-abuse law, research with heroin, marijuana,
and LSD may be conducted only after the Secretary of HEW has
approved the researcher and the protocol. In short, current
governmental policy is a critical factor in determining the type
of research that may be done under federal auspices or approval. </p>

<p>Other possible sources of funding for basic research on drugs
of abuse are the states, the universities, and the pharmaceutical
industry. Thus far, the states have concentrated on applied
research, primarily in the area of treatment. The universities
appear to have no significant source of funds for basic research
other than the federal government. And the pharmaceutical
industry concentrates primarily on product-oriented applied
research. As a practical matter, therefore, most basic research
depends on federal funds. </p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry's research efforts are not only
product-oriented but, indeed, have the goals of increasing the
number of psychoactive drugs, enhancing their effect, or
improving their activity in some other fashion. From the
standpoint of drug abuse, the pharmaceutical industry is working
night and day to create products that will intensify the problem.
Many of these drugs, of course, have enormous medical value that
far outweighs their abuse potential. </p>

<p>The Need for Additional Basic Research. It is apparent that
there is a serious lack of basic information about how drugs of
abuse work and their long-term effects on the body. Many examples
could be given, but a few will make the point: </p>

<p>Since World War 11, there have been over 3,000 technical
papers on LSD. But scientists still do not know why LSD causes a
psychoactive effect, or whether it is toxic, or whether it causes
birth defects, or whether the widely reported
&quot;flashback&quot; effect is real or imagined and, if real,
has an organic basis. In short, many of the most important
questions remain unanswered. </p>

<p>Morphine was first isolated in the early 1800's, and heroin
was synthesized in the late 1800's. Among the things we still do
not know about these drugs are the mechanisms by which tolerance
develops, or whether an addict can be stabilized on a given dose,
or whether the drugs cause any organic damage, or the mechanism
by which they alleviate pain, or even whether withdrawal can be
psychologically as well as physically induced. </p>

<p>While it is common knowledge that many drug users, including
those on methadone, use combinations of drugs, little is known
about the effects of these combinations. For example, mixtures of
heroin and cocaine, or of amphetamines and barbiturates, are
often taken, but we do not know how they interact. </p>

<p>We have been unable to discern agreement among researchers on
what is and is not known, or on the priority needs for research,
with respect to the drugs of abuse. </p>

<p>Basic research questions concerning psychoactive drugs can be
divided roughly into two groups: (1) toxicological and
pharmacological effects, and (2) psychological and perceptual
effects. </p>

<p>Scientists probably know most about the toxicology (organic
damage done to the human body) of drugs of abuse, yet even here
there are many unanswered questions. It is known, for example,
that excessive use of alcohol and barbiturates causes extreme
damage to the brain and liver. It is suspected that amphetamines
in massive doses also cause organic damage, but scientists are
not yet sure. There is insufficient toxicological information on
the opiates (e.g., heroin, morphine), the cannabinols (e.g.,
marijuana, hashish), and the hallucinogens (e.g., LSD,
mescaline), the three categories of drugs with which the country
is most concerned. </p>

<p>The organic damage caused by drugs is, of course, only one
aspect of the more general study of pharmacological effects that
is, on what cells does a drug operate, how does it operate, what
metabolites are triggered, and so forth. Nor are such questions
unique to drugs of abuse. There appears to be no general theory
of drug action based on the chemical structure of drugs into
which discrete studies of the pharmacology of the drugs of abuse
can be fitted. And there is a question whether psychoactive drugs
do or do not represent a separate class of pharmacological
compounds that can be studied at a theoretical level, independent
of the study of pharmacology generally. </p>

<p>Basic pharmacological research would undoubtedly provide
useful knowledge for basic researchers, from which they may some
day construct a general theory of psychoactive drug action. The
central-nervous-system effect of drugs is, however, a
particularly difficult area of study. Many of the drugs with
which we are concerned have effects that are apparently quite
subtle and difficult to delineate. Some of the major
tranquilizers, which exert immensely potent effects on the brain,
have been studied intensively by NIMH for almost twenty years,
and we still do not really know how they work. It is uncertain
whether more could be learned faster by studying LSD, marijuana,
or even heroin. In short, the road to a general understanding of
the pharmacological effects of psychoactive drugs is difficult,
and basic research in this area is not guaranteed to be
productive. </p>

<p>Brain functioning is, of course, one of the current frontiers
of science, and the complexities of studying the central nervous
system make it likely that this area will remain a frontier for
years, if not decades. Although drugs are simply one type of
instrument for the study of the broader questions, the drugs of
abuse may be a particularly interesting input because they
clearly have large effects on the brain. </p>

<p>There is a great deal of work to be done here, and much of it
will be important. As the pharmacologists study the physiological
correlates of drugs and the psychopharmacologists and
experimental psychologists study the psychic correlates, at some
point in time linkages will be made leading to a unified view of
the entire process. </p>

<p>The second category of potential research concerns the general
interaction between drug taking and psychological and perceptual
awareness. Such psychological variables as anxiety levels,
attitudes toward self, perceptions, attention span, and mental
ability are all affected by drug taking. Conversely, pre-existing
states of mind and attitude have a significant impact on whether
an individual will seek drugs in the first place and on the
actual effects of a drug once it is taken. </p>

<p>Historically, because drug abuse has been looked at primarily
from the standpoint of deviant behavior, the study of its
psychological and perceptual effects has been placed largely
under the heading of psychopathology. Interest in the role of
external stimuli, of which drugs are but one example, in altering
the individual's perception and awareness of his surroundings has
increased in recent years. There is, for example, greater
scientific interest in the subjective experiences and
descriptions, rather than simply objective phenomena, connected
with drug taking. As with basic pharmacology, there is much
important information yet to be obtained in this developing area,
all of which is fundamental to a better understanding of human
functioning; but the progress of such research will likely be
slow and uncertain. </p>

<p>This area of interest, also, is not discrete. There are
clearly physical correlates for different states of perception
and awareness, although the links have yet to be forged. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION</b> </p>

<p>There is substantial uncertainty and confusion in the area of
drug education and prevention. Although nearly all workers in the
field believe strongly that sensitive and accurate drug education
programs can play an important role in preventing harmful drug
experiences among youth, there is no real evidence that such
educational efforts are successful. Educators are cautious about
new programs because of concern in some quarters that too much
discussion about drugs of abuse could glamorize them and lead to
experimentation. There is also increasing concern about the use
of ex-addicts in schools. Although they are popular with students
for &quot;telling it like it is,&quot; there is justifiable fear
that providing them with an aura of prestige may lead significant
numbers of students to believe that they can and should try drugs
themselves. </p>

<p>Past efforts have generally been of the &quot;scare&quot;
type, emphasizing the moral and physical degradation of drug
abuse and generously sprinkled with blatant misinformation,
especially about marijuana. In schools, such lectures are usually
delivered by gym teachers or visiting law-enforcement officials.
Their aim has been one-dimensional-to stop young people from
trying any illegal drugs. </p>

<p>It is now widely recognized that drug education, to succeed
with increasingly sophisticated young audiences, must be
accurate, factual, and consistent with the listener's own
experiences or observations. Although a truly candid educational
program may reduce involvement with the more dangerous drugs,
such as heroin, it may also increase experimentation with the
less dangerous drugs, such as marijuana, and many educators are
reluctant to be drawn into an approach with such potentially
controversial consequences. The federal government spent $3.5
million during the summer of 1970 in an attempt to train 350
schoolteachers, administrators, and student leaders to conduct
workshops in their home communities dispensing information about
drugs. The ability to withstand attitudinal confrontations of
skeptical students was stressed. We have no indication whether
this program was successful. </p>

<p>Virtually none of the myriad drug-education programs swamping
the market from private companies, civic organizations, and even
the government itself has been evaluated. The only detailed
evaluation we have seen, involving a model-education program in a
high school, showed that students improved not only in their
factual knowledge but in their cautionary attitude toward drug
use. That evaluation showed that the students liked the personal
accounts of ex-addicts best but chose doctors to tell the facts.
The students wanted more emphasis on the particular drugs in
common use in their school and an approach that took the drugs up
one by one rather than all grouped together. </p>

<p>The current emphasis among educators is on a continuous
spectrum of education about drugs generally (legal and illegal),
from kindergarten through high school, and on the integration of
drug education into other social-problems curricula, which would
include alcohol, smoking, sex, family living, and so forth. Dr.
Norman Zinberg of Harvard has been evaluating such an
experimental course for senior and junior high schools outside of
Boston and expects to produce an effective and exportable
curriculum. Dr. William Soskin in California has a different kind
of program, for which school credit is given, that creates a
third force besides family and school in the youth's life-a
primary group with which he shares experiences all week,
including a heavy emphasis on inner exploration. </p>

<p>One intrinsic problem with any kind of school-based education
is that a large portion of serious student drug users have
already rejected school. The motivational exploration that
educators stress can be carried on only in a spirit of trust, and
too many schools still require teachers and counselors to report
all known or suspected users to the police. Only a few schools
have had the courage to experiment with the designation of one or
more teachers or counselors as official confidants to whom
students can turn for help without fear of exposure. Few schools
have close working alliances with treatment resources to which
they can refer students. Parental permission for such treatment
poses another legal obstacle to such desirable arrangements. It
is doubtful that the federal government's crash summer
teacher-training program can surmount these basic problems
without a more fundamental change in community attitudes. </p>

<p>The National Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and
Information, composed of nearly one hundred government and
private agency members, has recently entered the drug education
field.' It conducts evaluations of the explosion of anti drug
films and literature and stresses rational, coordinated efforts
by city leaders to explore the basis and true extent of a
community's drug problems and how the community can best utilize
its resources for dealing with them. NCC's approach is that drug
education should not aim at suppression of all illicit drug use
but should teach children to make rational decisions based on
reliable information about which drugs they will use and how much
they will use them. </p>

<p>It can reasonably be expected that more federal money will be
channeled to the states and cities for drug education, with
little direction on how it should be spent. There are only the
most primitive notions of how to determine whether a
drug-education program has been successful. Even the goals of
such programs are hotly contested. And there is little emphasis
on evaluation techniques by the federal government. </p>

<p>At least in the immediate future, most schools will probably
be unable to alter their basic authoritarian structure to the
kind of open-minded approach to drug education that will help
early experimenters or drug-prone students. The mere presentation
of basic facts,, even if honestly set forth, can be expected to
have limited value in stopping the spread of youthful
experimentation, and a law-enforcement orientation that requires
school personnel to report all users will totally undermine
education efforts. </p>

<p>It is probably also true that adults, more than school
children, need accurate drug information to counter long-held
myths. An appalling number of well-educated parents, as well as
their children, still fail to understand the real differences
among drugs of abuse. This misunderstanding is perpetuated in the
1970 federal drug-abuse law, which provides a one-year maximum
prison sentence for possession of any illegal drug, regardless of
whether it is quite dangerous (like heroin) or less harmful (like
marijuana). </p>

<hr>

<p><b>TREATMENT</b> </p>

<p>With respect to treatment, two basic problems exist. First,
relatively few drug-dependent persons are currently in treatment
programs, largely because the programs do not have sufficient
facilities or staff. Second, existing treatment for drug abuse
and drug dependence has not produced impressive results (except
for some methadone programs), and, even if all drug abusers and
drug-dependent persons had treatment available to them, the
outcome would be uncertain. </p>

<p>There are three general types of treatment modalities for
users of drugs other than heroin. In many urban centers where
drug use flourishes, crisis clinics have been set up to offer
immediate emergency services to drug users and other troubled
youths. They are typically staffed by youths under volunteer
professional direction. They give out drug information, analyze
street samples, &quot;talk down&quot; people with bad reactions,
and see that those in genuine medical danger get to hospitals.
Some also refer persons to long term treatment programs or
themselves offer individual or group therapy to drug users. San
Francisco's Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic is the best-known
example of such clinics now found in many cities. </p>

<p>Therapeutic communities, which operate on the basic assumption
that a character defect causes drug use, treat all drug users
with encounter-group therapy or a more gentle form of &quot;rap
session&quot; therapy. </p>

<p>Users of speed and LSD, and even heavy marijuana users, may
well have underlying psychiatric problems. The only treatment
available for them thus far is the kind of individual or group
therapy used with other mental-health patients. Its success
remains largely unevaluated. </p>

<p>Because heroin is regarded as the most serious drug threat to
society, there has been a much more concentrated effort at
treatment for heroin addicts. In New York City, where probably 50
to 60 per cent of the nation's heroin addicts reside, an
estimated 10 per cent are in some form of treatment. Washington,
D.C., has perhaps 15 per cent of its estimated 15,000 addicts
under treatment. As of October, 1970, there were about fifty
methadone projects throughout the United States serving a total
of about 9,00010,000 persons.' Nationally, it is safe to say that
well over 90 per cent of all heroin addicts are not in any
treatment program at all. </p>

<p>The two main treatment modalities for heroin addicts are (1)
abstinence, bolstered by outpatient or inpatient group therapy,
and (2) methadone maintenance, with or without supportive
services. (A possible third approach is longer-term
&quot;detoxification&quot; with methadone, which is given in
decreasing dosages until the subject is entirely drug-free.) In
New York City, nearly 4,000 heroin users are currently in fifty
residential therapeutic communities, and 5,000-7,000 are
reportedly on methadone. In Washington and Chicago, about half of
all persons in treatment programs are on methadone and half on
abstinence programs. There were, until recently, only a handful
of addicts on methadone in California because of a legal
restriction on its use outside institutions. Some legal
restrictions still exist today. Many other large cities still
have no methadone program at all. </p>

<p>Most methadone programs have long waiting lists. Almost all
treatment programs have selective admission criteria and thus are
probably skimming off the cream of the addict population. They do
not appear to handle the most criminally active and hard-core
addicts. </p>

<p>As compared to abstinence, methadone is clearly showing better
results. Depending upon the degree of prescreening and the amount
of supportive services built into the program, between 45 and 80
per cent of those admitted to methadone programs are successfully
treated, as measured by continuation in the program, decreased
arrests, job stability, and other social indicators.
Experimentation is being tried in a few places with
&quot;barebones&quot; methadone (without supportive services) to
see what portion of the addict population can make it on the
substitute drug alone, without concomitant social-adjustment
help. The most promising approach we have seen is putting both
methadone and nondrug treatment programs under the same
administrative roof. From a research standpoint, this permits
accumulation of a body of data from which a typology may be
developed to show which kind of addict succeeds in which kind of
program. There is some concern, however, that a multimodality
program, combining maintenance and abstinence alternatives, may
confuse patients and reduce the effectiveness of both approaches.
</p>

<p>The more comprehensive the methadone program, and the more
complete the data collection and evaluation, the more costly the
program will be and the fewer patients it will be able to serve.
Costs per patient per year may vary from a high of over $2,000
for a full service program to a low of $500 for a
&quot;barebones&quot; program. </p>

<p>Methadone has thus far been used primarily with older addicts
who have volunteered for treatment. Except in Washington, the
average age of persons in methadone programs has been over
thirty, close to the age when statistics indicate that a sizable
portion of both addicts and criminals tend to &quot;mature
out&quot; of their deviance. Whether methadone will do as well
with an involuntary population of younger age remains to be seen.
</p>

<p>There is a sizable problem of methadone acceptance, especially
in the black community, because of opposition from groups who
view it as a crutch indistinguishable from heroin and a source of
white enslavement of blacks. Detoxification from methadone
maintenance is being tried with a small number of patients. If
this proves successful, the cloud of lifelong dependence now
hanging over methadone will be removed and methadone should prove
more acceptable among blacks. </p>

<p>Another problem is the possibility of &quot;leakage&quot; in
the control system. Diversion of methadone poses a danger, as is
indicated by the death of several non-opiate users who had not
built up a tolerance and who ingested large doses. On the other
hand, methadone appears to be safe for use by addicts in
controlled maintenance programs. </p>

<p>Although all available evidence indicates that methadone is a
safe and effective method of treatment, the federal government
has nevertheless concluded, apparently for policy reasons, to
inhibit its use by giving it only investigational status. This
raises costs and staff requirements and limits the number of
addicts who can be treated. It is unclear what additional
information, if any, would persuade the Food and Drug
Administration to alter this decision.' </p>

<p>Until methadone leaves the research context in which it now
legally resides, its potential parameters will remain unclear.
And just how much federal money will be available in the future
to encourage methadone or multimodality programs in all major
cities is unknown. </p>

<p>Some work is also being done on the nonnarcotic antagonists,
primarily cyclazocine and naloxone, which block the euphoric
effect of heroin. Several hundred people have now used these
antagonist drugs. The chief problems in their use have been the
short duration of action of both drugs-four to eight hours for
naloxone, about the same as heroin, and 22 to 26 hours for
cyclazocine, about the same as methadone-and, until recently,
unpleasant side effects from cyclazocine. Work has been
undertaken on longer-acting antagonists and on an implant that
could discharge the drugs over a period of weeks. The
antagonists, however, apparently do not satisfy the drug craving
as methadone is said to do and have not proved as popular with
addicts. </p>

<p>Other, more conventional methods of treating heroin addiction
appear to have a substantially lower success rate than methadone,
although comparison is difficult because of the differences in
the types of drug users treated, the criteria for success, the
statistics kept, and so forth. </p>

<p>Therapeutic communities like Daytop Village, Odyssey House,
and Phoenix House purport to have up to a 75 per cent success
rate with those who stay in the program, but they do not include
in their figures the large number of addicts (estimated as high
as 50 per cent) who drop out within the first month or two. Dr.
Jerome Jaffee's work in Chicago, which to our knowledge
constitutes one of the few attempts to compare the effectiveness
of methadone and therapeutic communities with the same
population, shows a startlingly greater success with methadone
than with the therapeutic community. Of the 2,500 addicts who
have been treated in the New York City Addiction Services
Agency's Phoenix Houses since 1967, only 130 have graduated back
into community life (and 90 per cent of these work in addiction
programs). An inpatient in such a facility costs $3,000 to $5,000
per year compared to a cost of $500 to $2,000 for a methadone
patient, but methadone may require a longer, or even a permanent,
period of treatment. It seems highly unlikely, in any event, that
there could ever be a sufficient number of residential
therapeutic communities to have a major impact on the problem. </p>

<p>Black community organizations, such as Colonel Hassan's
Blackman's Development Fund and the Bonabond Agency in
Washington, also claim a special ability to keep black addicts
off heroin by abstinence therapy following detoxification with
methadone and appeal to racial pride. But thus far their claims
of success have received no objective evaluation. </p>

<p>NIMH is still committed to comprehensive community mental
health centers as the answer to the drug-treatment problem, but
recent federal legislation for the first time permits support of
drug-treatment programs unaffiliated with these centers. We have
been able to find only a few examples of success with the
community-mental-health-center approach and an equal number of
outright failures. The successful community-mental-health-center,
drug-treatment programs would appear to be just as successful if
they were not affiliated with the centers, and even in theory
there is reason to question the inclusion of drug treatment under
the umbrella of the centers. In any event, we are unable to find
statistics on the effectiveness of this approach. </p>

<p>Virtually everyone agrees that individual psychiatric therapy
not only is impractical because of the large number of addicts
but generally produces poor results with addicts. </p>

<p>There is one method of treatment that has not been attempted
in this country since the Bureau of Narcotics, with the support
of the American Medical Association, stamped it out in the early
1920's-heroin maintenance. At one time, there were some forty
heroin-maintenance clinics in several areas of the country,
unfortunately under rather loose procedures. The Bureau succeeded
in banning them by 1923 and has since done everything possible to
discredit this method of treatment. The suggestion by a
prestigious joint American Bar Association-American Medical
Association Committee in the late 1950's that experimentation
with a heroin clinic program again be undertaken was met with a
vicious attack by the Bureau of Narcotics. During the past five
years, the Bureau of Narcotics (now the Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs) and NIMH have argued that the British system of
narcotics maintenance has utterly failed and could not reasonably
be considered for use in this country. (Staff Paper 7 of this
report, prepared for the Project after an extensive on-site
inspection and investigation, concludes that the British system
of narcotics maintenance appears to have succeeded in containing
the narcotics problem there.) </p>

<p>One outstanding deficiency in the treatment field involves
evaluation. Several treatment programs, mostly
methadone-maintenance programs, have data-collection and
evaluation components. The Dole-Nyswander program in New York has
been intensively evaluated by a prestigious medical committee,
and indeed the evaluation of methadone in various programs
throughout the country has now reached the point where there can
no longer be serious question about the general usefulness of
this treatment approach. The vast majority of the treatment
programs, however, and particularly the non-methadone programs,
have relatively narrow or quite inadequate data-collection and
evaluation components, or no such components whatever. Moreover,
data collection and evaluation are not standardized, with the
result that comparison of programs or techniques for different
patients, taking into account the many possible variables, is
simply not possible at this time. </p>

<p>The Illinois Drug Abuse Rehabilitation Program, under Dr.
Jerome Jaffe, has an unusually sophisticated system of data
collection and analysis combined with a multimodality treatment
program, thus permitting direct comparison of the effectiveness
of different techniques. Similar programs with useful research
components include the Washington, D.C., Narcotics Treatment
Agency, under Dr. Robert Dupont, and the Connecticut Mental
Health Center in New Haven, under Dr. Herbert Kleber. But no such
program has the funds or time to standardize data collection for
all other programs or to persuade others to adopt a uniform
system, much less to attempt to standardize and persuade others
to adopt uniform evaluation criteria. </p>

<p>Without sufficient detailed data collected on a standardized
basis by a substantial number of different projects, there can be
no satisfactory comparative evaluation of various treatment
approaches for different types of drug users. Largely
unsubstantiated and disputed claims of success and failure will
continue to dominate the field until adequate evaluation is
accomplished. </p>

<p>A second deficiency apparent throughout the country is the
lack of enough trained administrators to run treatment programs.
The few outstanding treatment projects emphasize the need for
scholar-administrators with a medical and drug-abuse background
but also with management skills. The most able project directors
do not fall into the typical civil-servant mold but, rather, are
men willing to take gambles and basically to let themselves be
&quot;burned out&quot; in a few years. How to create a reserve of
people equipped with this unique combination of talents and bow
to provide incentives for them to enter the field are critical
questions in the future of treatment. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LAW ENFORCEMENT</b> </p>

<p>Law enforcement has, of course, been the primary means by
which society has attempted to control drug abuse in the past and
at present appears to represent the principal effort for the
future also. Arrests for drug offenses have increased
dramatically during the past few years, from 31,752 in 1960 to
134,006 in 1968 and over 230,000 in 1969. Such arrests of persons
under eighteen rose from 1,688 in 1960 to 33,091 in 1968 and over
57,000 in 1969. </p>

<p>There is, however, an acknowledged lack of direction and of
trained manpower in state and city efforts, which results in
scant disruption of illicit traffic above the street level. Most
arrests are of users. The principal sellers arrested are
amateurish young softdrug peddlers and addict street dealers.
Studies show that almost all heroin addicts get arrested at least
once every two years of active addiction and spend an average of
15 per cent of their addicted life in jail. In New York City in
June, 1970, there were 4,000 drug arrests compared with 1,800 in
June, 1969. About 60 to 70 per cent of those arrests involved
heroin. In Washington, D.C., arrests doubled in the first six
months of 1970 and now run about four hundred per month; over 50
per cent involved heroin. California reportedly made 150,000 drug
arrests for use and possession in 1969, a 300-per-cent increase
over 1967, and it is unclear whether all of these are reflected
in the national statistics. </p>

<p>BNDD has recently announced that it will provide no more than
consultative services to local police in use, possession or small
trafficking cases, and it is increasingly shifting its resources
to the apprehension of large traffickers. In 1969, its agents
made or instigated 4,000 arrests; for 1971, this figure is
expected to fall to about 1,875. Basically, however, the
criminal-law approach appears to have had little impact on the
growth of the problem, as is demonstrated by the fact that
illegal drug use, by everyone's calculation, is increasing and
shows no signs of leveling off. </p>

<p>The federal government formerly took the position that illegal
drugs that are imported, such as heroin and marijuana, could be
stopped at the border if sufficient resources were allocated to
this effort. In spite of recent large increases in budget and
manpower, however, no significant impact has been made. Border
seizures of heroin amounted to less than 5 per cent of the
estimated imports in 1970. Indeed, the price of heroin has been
falling steadily and the quality increasing, which indicates a
failure to stem the supply. There is strong evidence that
Operation Intercept, the attempt to impede the flow of marijuana
from Mexico into the United States, has resulted in significant
substitution of other drugs for marijuana. </p>

<p>The illegality of heroin is, of course, the sole reason for
its high cost in this country. In England, the pharmacy cost of
heroin is $.04 per grain (60 mg.), or $.00067 per mg. In the
United States, the recent street price is $30-$90 per grain, or
$.50-$1.50 per mg., depending on the time and place of sale and
the quantity and quality of the drug. </p>

<p>As a result of the failure to stop heroin at the border,
recent federal government 'policy has concentrated on cooperation
with foreign governments, primarily Turkey, to reduce their opium
production. Since it is estimated that the United States requires
only 50,000 to 60,000 pounds of opium each year for illicit
heroin use, since this amount is about 1.5 per cent of the total
world production of opium, and since the entire U.S. demand could
probably be met by cultivation of about five square miles of
opium,' and since opium could readily be grown in other parts of
the world, a program based upon suppression of opium production
seems no more likely to succeed than the program based upon
prevention of importation. </p>

<p>Finally, the initial hypothesis that drugs were not
interchangeable-that, for example, a heroin addict would not be
likely to switch to a different drug (e.g., the barbiturates or
amphetamines) if heroin were unavailable-does not appear to be
true. There is evidence that users will freely substitute even
less potent drugs if their drug of choice is not immediately
available. There is a far greater pattern of multiple drug use
than was previously thought to exist. Suppression of one drug for
a period of time, whether long or short, appears, therefore, to
have a limited effect on drug abuse generally. </p>

<p>The law-enforcement approach to drug-abuse problems has been
ameliorated by legislation permitting civil commitment in lieu of
criminal punishment. Under present legislation, however, such
treatment is largely illusory, since it is almost wholly
institutionalized and often results in greater punishment than
would be imposed by a criminal sentence. It is doubtful that
institutionalization under these programs has been markedly more
successful in rehabilitation than criminal sentencing. </p>

<p>New York, California, and the federal government have civil
commitment treatment programs that take a relatively restricted
class of criminal defendants in lieu of prosecution or sentencing
(as well as persons committed voluntarily or by relatives and
others). The New York and California civil-commitment programs
have proved very expensive-$4,000 to $5,000 per patient per year
for care and treatment in New York, and a total of $12,000 for
all costs. About $250 million was spent by New York State in
1967-70, the major share for capital construction and custodial
salaries. Only one out of five patients successfully survives the
parole period in the California program, and less than 25 per
cent the New York program. The federal Narcotic Addict
Rehabilitation Act (NARA) program currently has under 1,000
persons in an outpatient status and 800 in an inpatient status.
Many addicts are ineligible for treatment because of the
restrictive admission criteria contained in the Act, and almost
half of the cases referred for evaluation are rejected because
they are found &quot;not likely to be rehabilitated.&quot; In
general, civil commitment programs have suffered from cumbersome
legal machinery, restrictive admission requirements, inflexible
terms of inpatient residence, expensive security consciousness,
lack of dynamic programs, and active resentment among inmates
because of the prison like climate and poor treatment efforts. </p>

<p>juvenile courts appear to offer one of the most flexible ways
of channeling youthful users into early treatment, yet they are
rarely used for this purpose. Almost all addicts are arrested
first while in their teens. Most juvenile courts already have the
power to divert drug users rapidly to a treatment agency, even
without a formal finding of law violation, and they can keep all
records confidential. Speedy urinalysis and a closer working
relationship between juvenile courts and community treatment
programs might have an impact on the problem. Ordinary juvenile
institutions are less useful. They are experiencing an increasing
problem with contraband drugs (we have been told that many youths
get their first drug experiences there), and few, if any, have
drug education or therapy programs, or indeed any urinalysis
surveillance, after inmates leave the institution. </p>

<p>The federal government (as well as local and state police
agencies) has been severely criticized for devoting its
law-enforcement efforts to drug users and addict pushers and
failing to prosecute large drug wholesalers. In New York and
Washington, and probably elsewhere as well, grassroots
organizations claim to know the identity of the larger
wholesalers and in some instances state that they have turned
information over to law-enforcement officials without results. </p>

<p>The short working life of undercover agents, the large amounts
of cash necessary to make substantial &quot;buys,&quot; and the
structure of the heroin market, which is designed to insulate
higher figures from contact with the drug, are the reasons most
commonly cited by law-enforcement and community officials for the
paucity of results in disrupting the heroin traffic. But the
factor more commonly cited by ghetto groups, and increasingly
also by such respected citizens as former Chief justice Earl
Warren, is corruption of narcotics agents. More than thirty
federal agents were reportedly indicted on bribery and
narcotics-sale charges during 1969 and 1970. The view is endemic
in ghetto areas-and apparently it is justified at least in
part-that the federal, state, and local police are not doing
their job, and that they should be able to arrest more dealers
and distributors than they do. Although it may be partly a
question of better training, direction at the top, and placement
of a higher priority in the area, there may also be widespread
corruption involving pay-offs at the lower levels between police
and pushers. </p>

<p>Both previous and present federal drug statutes make
possession of an illegal drug of abuse a crime. When the Drug
Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 were enacted to cover nonopiate
drugs, possession for personal use was not made a crime, but this
was changed in 1968 because of the LSD scare. The legislation
enacted by Congress in 1970 to recodify and modernize all the
federal drug-abuse laws continues the policy of making possession
a criminal offense, with a one-year maximum sentence for
possession of any illegal drug and twice this term for second and
subsequent offenses. Neither prior law nor new legislation
provides that an addict is not criminally liable for possession
of a drug to support his habit. Test cases are being litigated to
develop this defense as a matter of constitutional or common law,
and the staff of the National Commission on Reform of Federal
Criminal Laws has proposed that this should in any event be a
statutory defense. Congressional support for such a defense
would, however, appear difficult to obtain. </p>

<p>Regardless of judicial or legislative reform, it appears that
the law-enforcement process will remain a significant, and
probably by far the most important, intake unit for
drug-dependent people for many years to come. At present only a
few, crude attempts are being made to utilize this intake path to
channeling addicts into useful treatment programs outside the
civil commitment procedures. </p>

<p>Drug users are generally processed as ordinary criminals, and,
conversely, a large percentage of ordinary criminals, when tested
by urinalysis, are found to be drug users. Urinalysis tests in
the criminal courts and detention facilities of major urban
centers show that one-third to one-half of all criminal
defendants, including juveniles, are currently using drugs, and
some estimate that 80 per cent of the serious property crime in
Washington, D.C., is committed by drug users. The likelihood that
a criminally processed drug user will be given any specific
treatment during his incarceration is slight. But even more
basic, attempts at treatment programs in the prison setting have
been markedly unsuccessful. Indeed, there is evidence that many
nonusers or experimenters are first introduced to drug use or
have their habits reinforced while in prison. One survey showed
that 90 to 95 per cent of the heroin addicts who leave prison
without treatment follow-up lapse almost immediately into drug
use. Many of the major urban areas now have parole programs that
test for drug use through urinalysis, and a few offer parolees
methadone, group-therapy, and/or halfway-house programs.
Nonmethadone programs with probationers and parolees, however,
have not proved very successful. The majority of such
probationers and parolees have had to be returned to prisons or
court for drug violations. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LEADERSHIP</b> </p>

<p>It is our belief that a major reason for the confusion and
division within the drug-abuse field and the country in general
is the lack of effective leadership, on both a governmental and a
nongovernmental level. Effective leadership, by our definition,
includes such functions as keeping the country informed about
drug abuse and the latest drug research and arranging an open
climate for medical and social research and for reasonable
experimentation with different models of control. Effective
leadership should, further, avoid eliciting emotional public
reaction to isolated incidents and attempt to remove the drug
problem from national politics. </p>

<p>Within the federal government, there are three organizations
substantially concerned with drug abuse: BNDD, NIMH, and the
Department of Defense.&quot; </p>

<p>BNDD has for years pursued a national approach to drug abuse
characterized by suppression of illegal drugs and the enforcement
of criminal penalties for drug abusers. Although Bureau officials
now emphasize the need for rehabilitation, the basic policy
position of BNDD has not been significantly altered. The
legislation recodifying federal drug-abuse laws, drafted by BNDD
and passed by Congress in October, 1970, represents little change
in fundamental narcotics policy and only reinforces and codifies
existing law (except for some modification of penalties). The
reason for the recodification, indeed, was not a desire for
reform but a need to repair legislative provisions voided by the
Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. </p>

<p>The new law still includes marijuana and heroin in the same
classification, provides a uniform penalty for possession of any
illegal drug, and contains such harsh sanctions as a thirty-year
maximum prison sentence for an eighteen-year-old with a prior
offense who sells marijuana to a twenty-year-old friend if there
is any profit involved in the transaction. Any change in the
basic BNDD approach of penalizing drug abuse seems highly
unlikely in the near future. </p>

<p>During the past two crucial years of public-policy
development, NIMH has been singularly impotent as an independent
voice in policy decisions and has seemingly been forced to accede
to the BNDD approach of relying almost exclusively upon law
enforcement. There is no reason to believe that NIMH will be
given substantially more leeway in putting forward policy
alternatives in the immediate future. Although there are a number
of NIMH personnel working on drug abuse who do favor a more
flexible and health-oriented approach toward drug users and who
would promote such an approach if allowed and encouraged to do
so, a significant change in federal policy is required before
they can be expected to speak out publicly on these matters. </p>

<p>Until mid-1970, the Department of Defense denied that there
was any drug-abuse problem at all in the military. It has now
admitted that drug abuse does indeed exist in the armed services
and is initiating a program for treating users as an alternative
to punishment and dishonorable discharge. </p>

<p>Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate to
liberalize treatment under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation
Act, to revitalize the narcotics work of NIMH, and to authorize a
far more comprehensive health, welfare, and rehabilitation
approach to the problems of drug abuse by the federal government.
But even if such legislation is enacted, the present
administration's emphasis on the law-enforcement approach could
undermine its effective implementation. </p>

<p>The state government picture varies, of course, from state to
state. Suffice it to say that, thus far, few states have refused
to follow the lead of BNDD with respect to narcotics policy and
that of the U.S. Congress with respect to narcotics legislation.
As an example of the current climate, the August, 1970,
Conference of Uniform State Law Commissioners approved a draft of
a uniform state drug-abuse law, prepared by a BNDD attorney, with
the understanding that it could be revised before final
publication to reflect any appropriate changes in light of
federal legislation then pending in Congress. An earlier draft,
based upon what BNDD had hoped to have passed by Congress, was
enacted by two states before the final version was available. </p>

<p>The nongovernmental organizations interested in the field of
drug abuse have not exerted significant leadership during the
past two years. During this critical time of public-policy
determination, professional, medical, and scientific
organizations such as the American Bar Association, the American
Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, and
the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council have
spoken out only on specific issues of interest to them and only
on isolated occasions. Because all these organizations deal only
tangentially with drug abuse and must rely for their efforts
primarily on busy professionals who have full-time jobs outside
the organization, none of them could be expected to exert the
effective leadership that is needed in this field. </p>

<p>There is no national voluntary citizens' organization in the
field of drug abuse comparable to the National Council of
Alcoholism (NCA), and NCA has recently decided that it will enter
this field only to consider problems in which drug abuse and
alcoholism interact. Both the North American Association of
Alcoholism Programs and the National Association of State Mental
Health Program Directors, which are organizations representing
state tax-supported agencies, also deal only tangentially with
drug abuse and have made no serious effort to become concerned
with the field in detail. </p>

<p>Largely because of this void, a paper organization, the
Committee for Effective Drug Abuse Legislation, was created to
represent the medical-scientific viewpoint before Congress during
the hearings on the new drug-abuse legislation. Since this
organization has been concerned almost exclusively with the
freedom to conduct research and is poorly funded, it has had to
ignore many other important public-policy issues. </p>

<p>Another new organization is the previously mentioned National
Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and Information,
created in 1969 to bring together virtually all national
organizations, from the drug industry to consumer groups, and
from the PTA to the National Student Association, for the purpose
of developing an effective drug-abuse education program. Although
the Coordinating Council is financed to a significant extent by
the federal government and has governmental representatives on
its board of directors, it has shown independence and a reasoned
approach to education and community planning in the drug field.
The Coordinating Council's achievements are largely the work of a
very few people, however, and, because of its precarious
financial underpinnings, it is uncertain how long and how
vigorously it can continue its efforts. </p>

<p><b>A MORE PROMISING APPROACH TO DRUG ABUSE</b> </p>

<p>The foregoing summary discloses a lack of leadership in the
field of drug abuse, a law-enforcement approach that is often
ineffective and even harmful, and a country deeply and even
bitterly divided over the proper approach to drug abuse. We
believe that an effective attack on drug abuse can be launched
only in a climate of reason and tolerance, allowing us to discern
the real evils of drug abuse while rejecting policies based on
confusion, misinformation, and emotion. </p>

<p>Before we can begin to cope adequately with drug-abuse
problems, therefore, we must begin to refine and clarify our
thinking about them. The world is full of drugs, large numbers of
which are psychoactive. The majority of adult Americans take
alcohol as a tension reliever or to facilitate social
intercourse, and the use of nonprescription and prescription
drugs for similar purposes is endemic. The availability and
variety of these drugs will probably not only continue but
increase. </p>

<p>Many of the drugs used have profound therapeutic benefits that
allow people to offset physical or mental pathology and function
more normally. Few of us would be willing to forego these
therapeutic benefits, and no one perceives the use of drugs to
achieve normal functioning as abuse. An increasingly large number
of people, however, are not willing to limit their drug taking to
medically supervised attempts to offset pathology. Some engage in
self-medication with drugs they have become acquainted with
through legitimate medical use. This pattern often occurs in the
case of tranquilizers. Some wish to escape an unwelcome reality
with heroin or barbiturates. Others desire the very acute
functioning associated with the amphetamines. Still others,
especially the young, seek the pleasurable effects of
hallucinogens or marijuana. </p>

<p>The basic philosophy underlying our present drug-control laws
is that all of these self-induced effects are to be shunned, or
at least are not to be sought through drugs other than alcohol.
This is a decision based partly on the fear of actual physical
damage caused by the drugs, but primarily on the belief that
drugs damage society because they contribute to crime and
alienation. </p>

<p>It seems inevitable to us that all segments of society will
continue to be exposed to a myriad of drugs in the future, and
that society must learn to cope with these chemicals as part of
everyday life. It is not possible at present to foresee exactly
how the necessary adjustments in social attitudes and policies
will be made. </p>

<p>We do feel, however, that current national policy-which
singles out particular drugs and makes their possession or use a
crime-should be changed for very important empirical reasons. We
believe that the individual and social harm caused by imposing
criminal sanctions on drug users far outstrips the benefits of
this approach. Handling drug users as criminals has created
widespread disrespect for the drug laws, has resulted in
selective enforcement, has possibly done more to encourage than
to discourage illegal drug use, has undercut bona fide efforts to
explain the important differences among various drugs in the
physical and mental damage they cause, and has deterred drug
abusers from seeking necessary help. We feel that, as a first
step in bringing the problem back into perspective, criminal
penalties for possession of illegal drugs for personal use only
should be abandoned in many jurisdictions. If this were done,
drug users but not drug traffickers-could then be handled on a
public health and social-welfare basis. Like the Canadian LeDain
Commission on Non-Medical Use of Drugs, which in its April, 1970,
Interim Report recommended retention of only a perfunctory $100
fine for illegal possession of drugs as an interim measure
pending issuance of its final report, we have seen no evidence
that eliminating the criminal penalties for possession of illegal
drugs for personal use would materially impede the effectiveness
of law-enforcement efforts against trafficking or remove an
incentive for drug users to seek treatment or have other
unfortunate consequences. </p>

<p>This conclusion in no way depends on a belief that chemicals
should be freely used to induce pleasure. Nor do we believe that
it is necessary to await final resolution of the currently
popular debate about whether alcohol or marijuana is the more
dangerous drug, a debate that has succeeded only in provoking
further generational confrontation about hypocrisy,
permissiveness, and life styles. Most of those who advocate a
public-health approach disapprove strongly of the unsupervised
use of dangerous drugs, especially by young people. Our
conclusion is based, rather, on a recognition that our present
methods of handling the drug abuser are at best ineffective and
at worst counterproductive, and that other approaches must be
tried. Eliminating criminal penalties for possession for personal
use would neither legalize a particular drug nor permit its use.
Law-enforcement efforts would, and in our opinion should,
continue, but they would be directed at illegal distribution. And
illegal drugs would remain subject to confiscation wherever
found. </p>

<p>If the confrontation over the role of the criminal law in
enforcing private moral judgments or choices of drugs were
eliminated, the country might be able to unite behind an
intensified approach to research, prevention, treatment, and law
enforcement directed against the upper echelons of the illegal
drug traffic. Restrictions on scientific research inquiries into
particular drugs might then be lifted and substantial public and
private funds more easily directed toward the understanding of
how drugs work on the mind and body and what effects, both short
and long term, they produce. Education of young people against
the reckless use of powerful substances that affect the mind
could proceed in a free and open climate more calculated to
influence their behavior. </p>

<p>As research discloses more about specific drugs, some might
eventually become candidates for limited legalization, in the
pattern now used for alcohol. In other cases, disclosure of
severe or permanent damage to the mind or body would require that
distribution controls remain under criminal penalty. With such
potentially harmful drugs, the user who refuses to accept
treatment, and who can be shown to constitute a danger to others,
might be committed civilly for appropriate treatment. </p>

<p>Voluntary treatment for harmful effects of drugs could
similarly be made more flexible and accessible under such a
system. Restrictions against any experimentation with heroin
maintenance and unjustified limitations on the use of methadone
maintenance could be reviewed and possibly removed. More public
funds would be devoted to current treatment efforts and to
searching out new treatment methods, to permit adequate handling
of all voluntary and involuntary patients. </p>

<p>Finally, law enforcement could continue to act as an intake
unit for treatment programs for those drug abusers accused of
minor trafficking or other crimes. Where the drug taking results
in dangerous antisocial acts, it is not unjust to require the
offender to undergo treatment as a condition of liberty or even
to offer it to him within the confines of the institution. But
law enforcement's main focus would be directed at illegal drug
wholesalers. In this endeavor, it would have the wholehearted
backing of vast numbers of Americans, young and old alike. </p>

<p><font size="5"><b>THE DRUG ABUSE COUNCIL</b></font> </p>

<p>In the previous section, we outlined an alternative approach
to drug abuse that we believe is more promising than the present
national approach. Private foundations do not have the means
fully to implement such an alternative approach, nor could they
legally do all that would be required to bring it about. A
foundation cannot, for example, properly engage in efforts to
change legislation. On the other hand, pursuit of the public
welfare is a well-recognized task of all private foundations, and
an important aspect of the approach described above involves
education, research, and related activities that have long
concerned private foundations. The basic goal might be summarized
as one intended to make national drug-abuse policy responsive to
facts rather than emotion. This is clearly an area where
foundations could properly play a very large role. </p>

<p>Our primary recommendation is that an independent, nonprofit
Drug Abuse Council be established to fill the leadership void
that now exists in all areas of the drug-abuse field. This would
preferably be undertaken as a joint project by a number of
private foundations and organizations. The Council would strive
to become a vitally needed center of excellence for drug-abuse
information, basic research, education, and prevention,
evaluation of treatment and education programs, and related
activities. </p>

<p>The federal government is not equipped to perform this
function. Its activities in the drug-abuse field are fairly
narrowly circumscribed by political necessities, it relies
largely on recruitment of civil-service personnel even at the top
leadership levels, and its financial commitments are short term
and subject to the vagaries of Congressional and administration
decisions. Federal activities in the drug-abuse field tend to be
ad hoc reactions to current crises, such as the 1970 crash
drug-education program in response to the well-publicized death
of a twelve-year-old heroin addict, rather than well-considered,
long-term programs. </p>

<p>Assuming that drug abuse will exist for years to come, and
that the country's policies should be grounded on fact and reason
rather than on emotion and politics, a long-range investment in
education, research, and treatment is necessary. The Drug Abuse
Council would be a long-term (ten years at a minimum) effort to
obtain the factual information needed to provide a basis for
sound policy and to disseminate to the public and to persons in
key policy positions the best knowledge available in the field
and the best analysis of this knowledge as it pertains to current
programs. </p>

<p>The Council would have a board of 10 to 15 trustees. Working
under the board's direction would be an interdisciplinary staff
responsible for performing the Council's daily work, headed by a
full-time president. The president would be a member of the Board
of Trustees, but not its chairman. </p>

<p>The majority of the Board of Trustees should be professionals
knowledgeable in the field of drug abuse. A few might be
prestigious figures in the national scene, but persons who would
commit themselves to a heavy working schedule consisting at a
minimum of one formal meeting a month and substantial contact
with the staff between meetings. </p>

<p>The Board of Trustees should include representatives of
medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, education, community
leadership, law, and sociology. Board members would be
appropriately compensated for their time and efforts. The
chairman of the board should probably be located in, or
accessible to, the city where the Council's headquarters are
located-preferably Washington, D.C.-and he should be
appropriately compensated for his additional work. </p>

<p>The president would initially work out with the board the
direction for the Council's first efforts. He would then recruit
his staff and proceed to implement those directives by drawing up
a detailed set of proposals for Council action. </p>

<p>The initial core of the Council staff might consist of a
medically trained person (probably a psychiatrist), a basic
researcher in the biochemical field, a social scientist, a
lawyer, and an editor writer schooled in simplifying technical
writing. This small nucleus could, of course, be expanded as the
Council's president and board define priorities and activities. </p>

<p>It is obvious that the President must be a key personality,
with proved administrative ability, and soundly grounded in the
drug abuse field, its politics, personalities, and peculiar
history. He would be responsible for proposing projects to the
board, arranging for their financing or administration, preparing
draft reports for board consideration, and so forth. Successful
implementation of the Council's objectives would depend to a
degree on the president's capabilities. </p>

<p>The relationship of the staff to the Board of Trustees also
deserves comment. Basically, there seem to be three types of
staff-board working relationships. First, a board of trustees may
operate as a figurehead, exercising minimal influence over the
activities of the staff. Secondly, it may have broad policy- and
priority-setting powers but leave most operating decisions to the
working group. This requires a far greater commitment of time by
the members of the board than the first relationship. Finally,
the board may directly run the organization through a staff
having little or no independent decision-making capabilities. In
essence, this third type of relationship would require the
melding of the board of trustees with the working group. </p>

<p>In the case of the Council, it appears that the most
productive staff-board relationship would be the second type-a
Board of Trustees with policy authority over the working group
but not actively involved in the actual day-to-day operations of
the group. Such a board would have an important role. Because of
the controversial nature of the drug field, board members must be
prepared personally to back Council projects and policy
statements and to withstand the inevitable attacks almost from
the day they convene. If the Council's pronouncements and work
are to carry weight in professional and governmental circles and
among the general public, the board must stand solidly behind
them. </p>

<p>Once under way, the Council should explore the potential for
action in many different areas. The following representative
list, which reflects areas of current immediate concern, is not
intended to exhaust the possibilities. Additional matters will be
uncovered, and priorities will change, as developments occur in
the field that cannot be predicted at this time. </p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Council may carry out its
objectives either by persuading others to undertake and finance
the work or by underwriting the work itself. Whenever possible,
the Council should encourage federal, state, and local
governments to increase their roles in drug-abuse programs. In
this respect, the Council should act as a watchdog, to make
certain that public agencies fulfill their intended
responsibilities. In many instances, however, private action,
either funded or undertaken directly by the Council, will also be
necessary and appropriate. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>SPONSORSHIP OF BASIC RESEARCH</b> </p>

<p>Although not nearly enough is known about the effects of drugs
on the mind and body, the investment of new research funds must
be carefully directed toward specific objectives, rather than
merely toward supplementing federal funds. Some knowledgeable
people are dubious about what could be accomplished by the
contribution of a few million dollars in private research funds.
Nevertheless, we believe that there are finite areas of basic
research that the Council could profitably explore. </p>

<p>Encouragement of Interdisciplinary Research. Universities,
where most basic research is done, tend to be structured along
departmental lines. The incentive structures for researchers and,
even more important, for graduate students tend to force the
researcher to stay within his area and not become part of an
interdisciplinary group. The Council might usefully promote
centers of interdisciplinarianism in this field. </p>

<p>There are cogent reasons for encouraging interdisciplinary
research. The question of why the same amount of drug ingested by
the same person produces dramatically different effects in
different settings puzzles scientists and must be studied outside
the laboratory as well as within, by psychologists and social
scientists as well as by pharmacologists. Many of the basic
pharmacological studies on the effects of heroin or methadone
should be attached to treatment programs, so that the subjects
could be studied and tested in the environment and under the
conditions in which they become and remain drug-dependent. Some
of the most creative hypotheses for basic research come from the
cross-fertilization of different disciplines thinking about the
same problem from different approaches. This is the kind of
innovative exposure that the federal government's research
program, based on the funding of finite projects to explore
already articulated hypotheses, does not at present have the
capacity to encourage. </p>

<p>One way of supporting this type of work would be to establish
a new in-house center for the scientific study of drug abuse on
an interdisciplinary basis. Another would be to put money into
the best existing university centers, on the condition that they
make some effort to study drugs of abuse in the context of their
over-all work. </p>

<p>Of these two courses, the second seems preferable. A number of
first-class researchers in a relevant field may not regard drug
abuse as their primary area of interest or as an area on which
they would wish to concentrate their full time, and in any event
they might not wish to move. The best researchers in the field
might be more willing to study drug abuse, either separately or
along with other matters of interest to them scientifically, if
permitted to remain at their present location. To a large extent,
this means funding interdisciplinary efforts in universities,
because that is where the best researchers are currently found. </p>

<p>In addition to multidisciplinary research in universities, it
might also be productive to fund a narcotics-research section in
an existing institution or simply to fund individual projects
wherever the best researchers exist. Finally, the Council might
wish to participate in an ongoing treatment program for the
unique information that the program might provide with a
reasonable additional investment in a research component. Such
questions as why heroin addicts stabilize at different levels of
methadone dosage and whether long-term tissue changes are caused
by a variety of drugs are often researched best with a large
treatment population at hand. Each of these possibilities must be
explored in greater detail by the Council staff before final
recommendations can be made. </p>

<p>Detection of Drugs in the Body. Pharmacologists have informed
us that the basic problem of drug detection in the body where
drugs go, how long they stay, what metabolites they produce, and
what happens to them-is not being studied in the way present
methodology would permit if research funds were available to
perfect it. The technology of drug detection is an area that is
very important to research but is not a high-priority item for
any single researcher or university because the benefits are
largely external to any particular project. This type of
technological development would be of value to all researchers
working in basic pharmacology. It would also enable the accurate
identification of drugs in cases of acute toxic reaction and thus
the development of better methods of treating or preventing such
toxic reaction. </p>

<p>Research in this area could also be directed toward
development of more accurate, rapid, and inexpensive equipment
for a variety of purposes. Of particular importance for both
law-enforcement and treatment programs is the chemical analysis
of urine specimens to detect heroin and other illegal drugs.
Urinalysis is used in broad surveillance programs in determining
whether bail should be set for criminals, in probation and parole
surveillance, in methadone-maintenance programs, and indeed in
virtually all types of drug-treatment programs. It is essential
to any evaluation of the success of these programs. Yet, in many
burgeoning methadone programs, such as that in Minneapolis, no
prompt and cheap urine testing is available, and samples must be
mailed hundreds of miles for analysis. </p>

<p>There is substantial doubt whether surveillance programs are
in all instances lawful, and even whether their use is productive
or counterproductive with respect to treatment results. It will
be some time before final answers can be obtained to these
questions. Meanwhile, it is clear that urinalysis surveillance is
increasing and will continue to increase (particularly if it is
made mandatory for all methadone programs, as has been proposed).
The problem is that urinalysis detection techniques can be
costly, inaccurate, and very time-consuming. They may therefore
limit the number of patients who can be admitted to treatment
programs because of the cost involved in continuous urinalysis
surveillance, wrong decisions may be made because of the
erroneous results obtained, and persons may be deprived of
liberty, placed under suspicion, or not given adequate treatment
for long periods of time while awaiting results. </p>

<p>BNDD and a few private companies reportedly are interested in
improving technology and methodology in this area, and there are
some indications of progress. One company has apparently produced
a marketable electronic device that would improve the speed and
reliability of urinalysis but not reduce the cost. We have been
assured that the technology for cheaper, reliable urinalysis is
available but requires an initial investment to produce the
models. Reducing the cost per unit from $1 to $2 to $.50 or less
could mean a savings of $.25 million for large-scale projects and
more for a city offering centralized urinalysis for all its
programs. Hopefully, the Council could persuade the federal
government to make the initial investment of a few hundred
thousand dollars to conduct this work, if the need is not
otherwise met in the near future. </p>

<p>Interaction of Different Drugs Taken in Combination. Large
numbers of drug abusers use several drugs, some legal and some
illegal, together or in substitution for another. The net effect
of their interaction may be quite different from that of either
one used alone. (There is some indication, for example, that
heavy barbiturate use may neutralize the effect of birth-control
pills used simultaneously.) Research on drug interaction could
lead to knowledge that might prevent toxic fatalities. </p>

<p>Research with Heroin and Heroin Maintenance. We are unaware of
any significant experimentation with heroin in this country,
either in animals or in humans. Such research would be
potentially very valuable in determining such questions as how an
addict stabilizes on any given dose of heroin, how well he
functions in society when consistently maintained on his drug,
how wide a range of variation in dosage can be given without
withdrawal, whether some people can use heroin indefinitely
without becoming addicted, and how long a person must use a given
dosage of heroin in order to become addicted. The usage patterns
of different types of heroin addict also remain a mystery and
have important research implications for treatment and education.
Research on such issues as these might well have to combine field
investigation and medical diagnosis. </p>

<p>One of the first problems the Council would face if it decided
such research was desirable would be obtaining the necessary
federal and state government permission, setting up the research
in a way that would satisfy medical ethics, and justifying the
need for the work to the public. </p>

<p>Miscellaneous. Another vital area not now being adequately
researched is the effect of drugs, including marijuana and
methadone, taken by pregnant women on the behavior and physical
characteristics of the child. </p>

<p>A high-priority question is whether there is either an inborn
physiological predilection to opiate addiction (as Dr. Dole
suggests) or a drug-induced physiological readdiction
vulnerability (as Dr. Martin suggests) or a learned response to
external stimuli (as Dr. Wickler suggests) or none of these.
Although we are not certain how this can be made the subject of a
directed research project, it is a question of the greatest
importance to the direction of treatment efforts, drug education,
and even legal responsibility for addictive behavior. An attempt
should be made to devise a series of experiments to advance this
kind of research. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>FUNDING PROGRAMS RELATING TO TREATMENT AND RESEARCH WITH
RESPECT TO TREATMENT</b> </p>

<p>We recommend that the Council should not, as a general rule,
fund ongoing treatment programs, except insofar as they make
possible unique research efforts not otherwise available. The
Council's efforts in this area should instead be directed
primarily toward providing the public climate necessary to assure
appropriate public financing of any drug-abuse or drug-dependence
treatment programs that are found worthy of support. As a
practical matter, Council funds could not begin to match the
amount of funding available from federal and state sources, if
those sources could be persuaded to allocate appropriate amounts
for treatment. </p>

<p>The failure of the Council to support ongoing treatment
programs will undoubtedly subject it to criticism from community
action leaders. We feel, however, that the Council should have
the more fundamental role of generating public support for drug
abuse programs and supporting and conducting research and
evaluation that will begin to establish criteria by which the
effectiveness of these programs can be measured. The Council
should, further, disseminate information throughout the country
with respect to programs that have proved to be worthwhile and
that, therefore, will have a broad and long-range national
impact. </p>

<p>The Council should, however, be on the lookout for truly
experimental and research-oriented treatment programs that,
absent nongovernmental support, will not be undertaken. Areas
that deserve careful consideration include the following: </p>

<p>Basic Field Work in Programs for juveniles and Hard-Core
Addicts. The populations least successfully treated are juvenile
drug abusers and hard-core addicts for whom all known treatment
methods have repeatedly failed. In our present state of almost
total ignorance as to what kind of prevention or treatment
programs will work with these populations, it may be necessary to
send people out into the field to study the problem for six
months to a year and then to come back and design operational
program models. There is to our knowledge no present source of
funding for any such basic field approach in new prevention or
treatment techniques. Prototype projects designed to test
specific hypotheses resulting from such field investigations
might then be recommended for operation by federal, state, or
local governments. </p>

<p>Heroin Maintenance. A related area that definitely seems worth
exploring would be an experiment with heroin maintenance. A
detailed study of heroin maintenance in the United States before
it was stamped out by the Bureau of Narcotics and of the
heroin-maintenance techniques that have been utilized in England
should undoubtedly precede initiation of such experimentation in
this country. </p>

<p>Research with respect to heroin maintenance-its possible use
as a bait to get young addicts into other forms of treatment, its
possible use as long-term maintenance for addicts who have
repeatedly failed with other treatment methods, and other
potential uses-might be a high-priority item for the Council. </p>

<p>As already noted, a substantial driving force behind the
present public concern about heroin addiction is the fear of
drug-related crime. Assuming that not all addicts can be
rehabilitated, and indeed that the addiction problem will remain
at least as great for some years to come, the hypothesis that
drug addiction leads to crime and that a major portion of our
crime wave is attributable to the high price of heroin must be
put to the test. Such a controlled experiment could determine
whether, using a heroin maintenance system, crime is indeed
reduced. The superiority of methadone over heroin, or vice versa,
in maintenance programs could also be explored for the first
time. </p>

<p>Management Assistance to Ongoing Programs. The Council might
also consider providing ongoing or nascent treatment programs
with desperately needed managerial assistance. A team of
management consultants who could look at local programs and
persuade their administrators to adopt proven techniques and
perhaps to create a data-acquisition and digestion system where
appropriate would be a major contribution to good treatment. The
few successful project administrators we have seen are working
full time in their own projects and cannot spend the necessary
months advising other projects. Many methadone programs are
subject to justified criticism, and a resultant loss of money,
because of sloppy or uninformed management practices or failure
to keep and record their data accurately. The kind of service we
propose could reduce such needless problems. </p>

<p>Regional Networks. Finally, the Council might work with states
and cities to help treatment centers from regional networks to
share knowledge and experience, and even to cross-refer patients
for specialized attention. This kind of regional network could
also make cross-comparisons of variable techniques easier and
allow interchange of personnel and pooling of funds for
urinalysis, data collection, and training programs for personnel.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>EVALUATION OF TREATMENT APPROACHES</b> </p>

<p>Several different treatment approaches are in use today. There
is also massive distrust among these programs, misinformation as
to what is and is not being done, and a lack of any reliable
means to separate truth from fiction. Evaluation approaches and
criteria for the various programs are not standardized, and basic
data often are not kept. Even when it exists, useful material is
often not organized or published. It is therefore virtually
impossible at this time to compare the effectiveness of any one
approach with any other, or to study the effectiveness of a given
approach for different types of patients. Because of lack of
evaluative data, we do not know, for example, whether and to what
degree the concurrent use of social services increases the
effectiveness of methadone, or the per them cost of patient
treatment under different programs correlated with the rate of
rehabilitation, or the dropout rate under various treatment
programs, or the type of person (age, pattern of drug use, race,
economic background) who volunteers for and is best handled under
various treatment programs. There is a great need for an
impartial body to attempt standardization of evaluation criteria
and techniques nationally and to disseminate the results of
objective evaluation of ongoing programs in order to promote the
most useful components of these approaches and discourage
ineffective and unproductive efforts. </p>

<p>One approach that the Council might consider in attacking the
information gap is to develop a uniform data-processing system
for drug-abuse projects and to provide several of the programs
with the necessary software and consultative services to install
such a system. Local treatment programs must participate actively
in working out a good data-evaluation system if they are to be
persuaded to cooperate. The results of the data collection might
be fed to a central receiving station where Council experts could
analyze it and interpret its meaning to the individual programs
as well as to other interested parties. </p>

<p>The decision as to what criteria should be used to evaluate
any treatment program, however, involves not merely data analysis
but basic value judgments based on experience. The Council should
be involved in setting these criteria. Major methadone programs,
for example, have been attacked because some of the participants
continue to use drugs intermittently. This raises the question of
whether eschewing all illegal drugs should be the sole or even
the primary goal for a treatment program, or whether enhanced
social functioning and cessation of antisocial acts, such as
stealing, are sufficient criteria for success. If the Council
could contribute toward formulating uniform criteria that reflect
a realistic and flexible perspective on what treatment programs
can be expected to accomplish and in what period of time, and on
the immediate and long-term nature of some of the goals of
treatment, it would be doing a tremendously worthwhile job. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>INFORMATION DISSEMINATION</b> </p>

<p>Technical Information. Technical personnel in the field,
researchers, treatment project personnel, and educators need a
comprehensive and accessible service that they can tap for
complete, accurate, and up-to-date information on specific
aspects of drug abuse, such as treatment proj ects, ongoing or
past research, model school curricula, or film listings. There
are at present several fragmented attempts to provide this kind
of informational coverage. On request, NIMH will supply, through
its National Clearinghouse for Drug Abuse Information, selected
material on drug-abuse problems. Within about six months, it is
hoped that the Clearinghouse will be able to provide a computer
printout of abstracts of all publications on any subject
requested, concentrating on publications appearing within the
last decade, and without evaluation of content. Because the NIMH
Clearinghouse is a government service, it feels that it cannot
exercise any discrimination in the articles it abstracts, and
hence it often abstracts worthless material or several virtually
identical publications of the same author in different
periodicals. NIMH also sends periodically, to certain persons,
the protocols of research grants in progress. The National
Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse Education and Information is
planning a looseleaf service to include information on treatment
projects, legislation, films, and what is known about the nature
and effect of individual drugs of abuse, but is not sure how
complete it can be because of budget problems. </p>

<p>Ideally, there should be one comprehensive index and digest of
all this material, perhaps in several looseleaf volumes, and
preferably one that is not prepared by the federal government. It
should encompass virtually all information pertinent to the
field, including a reasonably selective cross-indexed review or
abstract of past and present books, articles, reports, and
scientific papers, reprints from nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century literature on experiences with drug abuse that
are otherwise not generally available, descriptions of current
treatment and research projects, public-opinion polls and drug
surveys, evaluated lists of educational materials, digests of
laws, court decisions, and legislative proposals, and other
material. The compilation of such a digest and its periodic
updating would be an enormous undertaking, and one that might be
best accomplished by subsidizing another organization to do the
actual work. The relationship between the Council and the
editorial board of such a publication would have to be resolved. </p>

<p>Another important way of disseminating and highlighting the
best of current research findings is through a technical journal,
circulated largely to physicians, scientists, and other
specialists in the field. The Institute for the Study of Drug
Addiction, in New York, currently publishes the International
journal of the Addictions, which covers both alcoholism and drug
abuse. We have found this journal a very useful source of basic
information. The publishers state that the very limited number of
papers and abstracts, and the very small circulation, are due to
a lack of funds. </p>

<p>There seems to be no reason to set up a second journal of this
type. Subject to further exploration of this matter, we believe
that the Council should give serious consideration to working
with the Institute for the Study of Drug Addiction to expand the
articles and abstracts in their journal in order to cover the
field adequately (excluding alcoholism, which is covered well
enough in a separate journal), to make the journal a monthly
publication, and to increase its circulation. This would provide
the field with the detailed results of all significant research
on a current basis. </p>

<p>School Drug-Education Programs. The role of the Council in the
race to the schoolhouse must be approached with care. The
consensus is that private and public organizations are now
generating too many drug-education programs without sufficient
knowledge of basic educational techniques, pretesting, or
evaluation of results. </p>

<p>There are not enough professional educators sufficiently
schooled in drug abuse to teach teachers about drugs. Very often
we have found that those who teach counselors and others
responsible for drug education in the schools have themselves had
no training except for a few lectures. It may be that the Council
can affect this vacuum through support of university
interdisciplinary research that can train a cadre of experts to
teach the teachers in the universities and surrounding
communities. </p>

<p>Another contribution of the Council might be to help subsidize
the evaluation of drug films, literature, and curricula offered
to the schools. It might also design or commission methods of
evaluation by which school programs would be able to assess their
own results. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most critical problem of most school
drug-education programs is their passivity. The Council might
support and disseminate information about some less traditional
approaches, such as active engagement using drugs in behavior
experiments with animals, discussion of nondrug inducement of
altered states of consciousness, or extended discussions of
values and what youngsters hope to get out of drugs. These
represent a few of the more promising (but scarce) approaches we
have encountered. </p>

<p>The attraction of television for the young child makes it a
logical educational device on drugs. Consideration should be
given to working with a group skilled in educational motivational
techniques, such as Children's Television Workshop, on films for
use in elementary school or over national television. </p>

<p>General Public Information. Perhaps the single most important
service of the Council would be to act as an independent source
of relevant information for the public about drug-abuse problems.
There is a need for a new and wholly independent perspective on
such fundamental issues as the nature and scope of the drug
problem, the effects of present law-enforcement policies at all
levels, the real dangers of youthful marijuana use, the treatment
or recovery potential of different kinds of drug abusers, how
much crime can really be accounted for by drug abusers, how the
English system of heroin maintenance works and with what results,
the federal government's activity in terms of dollars, and the
allocation of those dollars among enforcement, treatment,
research, and education, the foreign experience with marijuana
users, and how a school-or a parent-should best react to the
presence of drugs. </p>

<p>These are the issues that are troubling Americans. Two New
York State public-opinion surveys showed that drug use was
considered a major neighborhood problem by 23 per cent of those
interviewed, surpassed only by burglary, vandalism, and unsafe
streets. A New York Times survey of 463 New York voters, reported
on October 4, 1970, placed drugs as the fourth most prominent
problem facing the nation and the foremost problem facing the
voter's immediate community. At present, the public receives its
information on these matters primarily from government sources. </p>

<p>Many methods must be used to inform the public of key
developments in the field and explore key policy issues in drug
abuse control. The Council could commission its own public
opinion surveys on key issues to guide the direction of its
information efforts. State-of-the-art papers might be published,
containing accurate but readable technical material on the nature
and effects of drugs. Accounts of comparative experiences of
different jurisdictions with varying law-enforcement, treatment,
and education approaches could be prepared and disseminated. </p>

<p>Whether such material is widely read will depend in large part
on its readability and press coverage. The Council will need a
good editor, with a sound basic understanding of the sciences and
able to write simply but accurately. It will also need a library
capacity to collect and analyze information of all kinds; it may
in time want to become a national information center, publishing
attractively packaged periodicals for the lay audience containing
such analyses. It may use radio and TV for forums in which
outstanding experts in the field can discuss key concepts and
thus dispel some of the myths that abound. Different media, of
course, would be targeted to different audiences-parents, youths,
inner-city residents, and the suburban middle class. </p>

<p>Consultative Services for Key Officials and Organizations. The
Council might wish to provide counseling services on a selective
basis for key figures and organizations in the drug-abuse field,
such as major professional organizations and leagues of city or
state officials. Such persons might wish to utilize the expertise
of Council staff in many areas before undertaking major policy
commitments or advising their members. Meetings and symposia
could be designed by the Council staff to facilitate
communication between key professionals and policy-making
officials and to disseminate its own findings. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>LAW-ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS</b> </p>

<p>Basic law enforcement is, of course, a federal, state, and
local governmental function, and we would recommend that the
Council not enter this field in any substantial way. </p>

<p>Although the federal government is now engaged in
international negotiations to reduce the supply of opium and its
foreign manufacture into heroin, as well as to increase border
surveillance to reduce its importation, we cannot be optimistic
about their efforts. Previous attempts by the United States to
stop foreign cultivation and manufacture have proved
frustratingly unsuccessful, and the number of world sources of
opium and the ease with which foreign production quotas can be
circumvented give no cause for belief that future efforts will be
any more successful. There is also a widely held belief among
experts in the drug field that, if any one drug of abuse were
eliminated, a new one would almost certainly be available to
displace it. Thus, even assuming that all heroin and marijuana
were stopped at the border, marijuana could be grown in this
country, synthetic hallucinogens (probably more toxic) could
readily displace marijuana, and synthetic opiates and other drugs
could readily be available for use in place of heroin. Although
better border control or reduction of supply might tighten the
market somewhat, thus forcing the price up, it seems unlikely
that it would have a substantial long-range impact on the
underlying causes and effects of drug abuse, or even on its
prevalence. In sum, this appears to be an area of limited
potential, wishful thinking to the contrary, and one in which the
federal government is already investing heavily. </p>

<p>We do recommend, however, that some exploration be made into
the reasons that law-enforcement officials at present seem unable
to prosecute more of the high-volume drug pushers once the drugs
get into the country, even though they profess to know who the
pushers are, where they engage in their operations, and a great
deal of other information about them. Prosecution of important
nonaddict drug pushers can have a temporary effect on total drug
availability at the street level and force some addicts into
treatment. It would, in addition, have a substantial
psychological effect in many ghetto communities, where it is
often thought that the police purposely do not prosecute drug
pushers because they have made deals with the illicit trader or
because they wish minority groups to remain enslaved to drugs. We
believe that exerting pressure on the commercial sellers of
illegal drugs is a desirable objective and should be done in the
most efficient way possible. For that reason, we recommend the
exploration with federal and local authorities of ways to
increase arrests at the top levels of the drug traffic. If the
Council enters this area at all, it should work closely with the
staff of the Police Foundation to encourage innovative strategies
by state or local police departments. The active utilization of
antidrug community groups to help in policing and exerting formal
sanctions in their own neighborhoods against pushers is one area
of potential. </p>

<p>The Council might also want to study the effect of various
laws and law-enforcement policies on the actual use of drugs and
the treatment of drug abusers. This area is badly in need of
careful study. The results of such a study might then become the
subject of a &quot;white paper&quot; by the Council for
consideration by local officials, budgetmakers, and the public at
large. It might also help to create a more open climate for
experimentation in different control strategies. The current push
from the federal government is for all the states to commit
themselves legislatively to a single model of law enforcement. It
would seem, however, that states should be as laboratories to try
out different approaches and to evaluate the results stemming
from those variations. </p>

<p>There also appears to be a real need for educational programs
specifically aimed at law-enforcement and court personnel, who
will probably continue to be the largest intake process for
illegal drug users. Although BNDD runs a law-enforcement training
program for state and local police officers with respect to
narcotics laws, it does not appear to emphasize the medical and
social aspects of drug abuse, its causes and effects, the
community resources that can be utilized in combating it from a
public-health and social standpoint rather than from a law
enforcement standpoint, the importance of not ruining the lives
of young children as a result of unfortunate experimentation with
drug abuse, and similar aspects of this problem. The Council
might fruitfully direct its efforts to helping police and court
personnel, both juvenile and adults, to develop informal
mechanisms for rapidly screening and diverting serious drug users
into treatment programs in lieu of legal processing. Conferences
might be sponsored for law-enforcement and judicial personnel to
focus on the best of these diversion programs. An effective
juvenile court treatment project along these lines is, in our
opinion, one of the greatest unmet needs in the entire field. </p>

<p>Finally, many improvements in the present law-enforcement
approach toward drug abuse may have to come from the courts.
There will be increasing attacks upon the irrationality of
present drug laws, centering upon the right to privacy involved
in the personal use of drugs, and the extension of the ruling in
Robinson v. California that a person may not be criminally
punished for addiction to include possession, use, and presence
in illegal establishments or association with other addicts. The
question of the right to treatment for an addict can be expected
to be raised not only in civil commitment programs, where
treatment is minimal, but also in communities without methadone
programs, or where methadone dispensation is severely restricted
by law, or even ultimately where doctors are not allowed to
prescribe it for addict patients. </p>

<p>In the juvenile field, a long-standing and perhaps legally
vulnerable impediment to treatment is the legal requirement for
paternal permission. Addicts can also be expected to raise their
eligibility for welfare as &quot;disabled persons&quot; or as
&quot;medically needy&quot; under Medicaid laws. Treatment
programs all over the country have encountered difficulties in
locating facilities in highaddiction areas because of outmoded
zoning laws. The right of &quot;gatekeepers,&quot; such as
teachers and nurses, to withhold from law-enforcement authorities
confidential information received from students may have to be
tested in the courts. Limitations of treatment programs to
selected kinds of addicts will probably also be legally attacked.
The adjustment of our now-primitive body of drug-abuse laws to
new medical developments in research and treatment may well have
to come about through a series of court cases as well as, and
even in the absence of, legislative changes. The Council staff
should keep abreast of such legal developments and, where
appropriate, lend financial assistance to legal groups seeking
such adjustments. The D.C. Lawyers Committee project on training
a corps of addict specialists and the comments filed on the
methadone regulations by the Center for Law and Social Policy are
examples of such worthy efforts. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE LEADERSHIP ROLE<br>
</b></p>

<p>We have suggested that the most critical reason for
establishing a Drug Abuse Council is to create independent
leadership in the field. That leadership must inevitably be
earned through professional and public credibility, and through
excellence of staff and product. The Council must lead in
formulating and disseminating sound ways of thinking and acting
toward drug use. It must, in short, become a center for policy
study in the drug field, to which researchers, legislators,
educators, policy-making officials, and the lay public will turn
for nonpartisan analysis and information. </p>

<p>This role can be accomplished primarily by using the best
thinkers in many different fields to find out what is actually
happening to drug users-not just the young experimenters or
mainliners, but the older pill-takers as well-why they are taking
drugs, and what other ways can be found to satisfy their
underlying urges and needs. The &quot;drug-abuse problem&quot;
needs to be perceived in a less rigid and emotional way by the
public at large. The nation has to understand how our present
system of drug controls really operates, and with what
consequences to what people. It must be given a realistic notion,
rather than palliatives, of what we can expect to accomplish
through education, treatment, and law enforcement, and what part
of the problem must be approached in even more complex and subtle
ways. </p>

<p>At the same time, there must be a sense of urgency about the
Council's work. As soon as it is organized, the Council must
consider such matters of immediate importance as </p>

<p>The work of the Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse
established under the 1970 federal drug-abuse law </p>

<p>The authority of the Secretary of HEW to authorize researchers
to protect the privacy of research subjects under the 1970
federal law </p>

<p>The obligation of the Secretary of HEW under the 1970 federal
law to report to Congress on the proper methods of medical
treatment of narcotic addiction </p>

<p>The authority of the Department of justice to establish quotas
for drugs, like heroin, that have no accepted medical use but are
needed for research purposes </p>

<p>The proposed new International Protocol on Psychotropic
Substances being considered by the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs </p>

<p>Implementation of the proposed new methadone regulations The
proposals to conform state law to the 1970 federal law and the
proposed new Uniform State Act </p>

<p>The proposed new federal Rules of Evidence that affect the
confidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship </p>

<p>Of equal importance, priorities must be established with
respect to the broad work of the Council and work begun on its
long range objectives. The projects that should be given prompt .
consideration include the following information: </p>

        crime, and so forth </li>
    <li>Evaluation of the English system of narcotic
        dispensationhow it works, the problems it has

        treatment program (especially methadone), analyzing such
        factors as the expectation that many patients will
        continue to use drugs, and the importance of recognizing
        the value of different types and degrees of success </li>
    <li>A review of the experiences of secondary schools with
        handling drugs-including the use of confidentiality
        guarantees, the designation of one or a few teachers as
        confidential advisers, expulsion or suspension, liaison
        with community treatment programs, and relations with
        law-enforcement officials </li>
    <li>Analysis of the legitimate expectations of curtailing the
        supply of drugs through border surveillance, Turkish crop
        subsidies, and similar techniques </li>

        those of a few major states) being spent on the drug
        problem and their allocation </li>
</ul>

        drug experimentation </li>
    <li>Categorization and review of the major characteristics of

    <li>A study of the optimal role of the pharmaceutical
        industry in the prevention of abuse-including
        consideration of proper production quotas for particular

        on abuse potential, and legitimate advertising to the
        public and to doctors </li>
    <li>A state-of-the-art conference on current research on the
        nature of heroin addiction-including the meaning of
        animal and human research, hypotheses being worked on,
        important issues, and productive lines of inquiry </li>
    <li>A study of the effects of heroin on users, in conjunction
        with a treatment experiment, to learn such basic facts as
        immediate effects on users, how to stabilize on heroin,
        the feasibility of simultaneous use of methadone and

        experimenters and chronic users, for hard and soft drugs,
        and for older and younger juveniles </li>
    <li>A paper on the state of treatment generally, pulling
        together the record of methadone, antagonists,
        therapeutic communities, and community mental-health
        centers, with evaluations where they exist, and
        consideration of such issues as public or private
        facilities, professional or indigenous staff, outpatient
        or inpatient, and voluntary or compulsory treatment </li>
    <li>A study of the employment of ex-addicts in treatment-the
        kinds of jobs available, the legal and community
        barriers, what job-training programs work for this group,
        and whether persons on heroin or methadone can do
        everything normal people can </li>
    <li>Assemble management consultants and material for
        dataprocessing systems for fledgling treatment programs. </li>
</ul>

<p>Law Enforcement </p>

<ul>
    <li>Monitor how the new 1970 federal drug-abuse law works in
        a few major jurisdictions-how it is enforced, against
        whom, the penalties given out, and what happens to the
        classification sections </li>
    <li>Compare the experience in states with high (e.g.,
        Missouri) and low (e.g., Nebraska) marijuana penalties to
        see the effect, if any, over a period of time on drug
        use, attitudes toward drugs, and drug education </li>
    <li>An analysis of the difficulties facing law-enforcement
        officials in the enforcement of drug laws against
        wholesale and retail traffickers </li>
</ul>

<p>It is not possible to lay down a step-by-step program for
changing the present climate surrounding drug abuse in the
country. How to get the country to focus on the real evils of
drug abuse and to attack them rationally without contributing to
the creation of even greater ones is a monumental task.
Hopefully, the Council will not be alone in working toward such
an end and will be able to enlist the support of state and city
governments, such branches of the federal government as NIMH, and
other private and professional organizations. Hopefully, too,
much of its work will affect the related problem of alcoholism
and will help to end the fragmented approach toward different
kinds of drug-taking. The pace of the work and the priorities
must obviously be decided by the Council board and staff itself,
guided by a realistic notion of the magnitude of the tasks facing
them and the opportunity to do something constructive about them.
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>

<p>It is of fundamental importance that man has and. will
inevitably continue to have potentially dangerous drugs at his
disposal, which he may either use properly or abuse, and that
neither the availability of these drugs nor the temptation to
abuse them can be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental
objective of a modern drug-abuse program must be to help the
public learn to understand these drugs and how to cope with their
use in the context of everyday life. An approach emphasizing
suppression of all drugs or repression of all drug users will
only contribute to national problems. </p>

<p>There is an urgent need for effective nongovernmental
leadership toward a more reasoned approach to drug abuse in this
country. A void exists that we believe can be filled by the
creation of a new Drug Abuse Council. In our best judgment, the
Council could successfully exert this leadership and could have a
substantial and beneficial impact on drug abuse in this country. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>NOTES</b> </p>

<p>1. Evidence obtained during 1971 indicates that the number of
active heroin addicts as of December, 1971, was probably between
250,000 and 300,000. 2. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention
and Control Act of 1970 reduced these penalties to imprisonment
for up to one year for a first offense and two years for each
subsequent offense. </p>

<p>3. The 1970 Act established a Commission on Marijuana and Drug
Abuse to review existing laws and policy and recommend necessary
legislation and administrative action. </p>

<p>4. See Staff Paper 5 for the most recent figures. </p>

<p>5. This information has become available and is presented in
Staff Paper 5. </p>

<p>6. In 1971 this organization changed its name to the National
Coordinating Council on Drug Use Education. </p>

<p>7. By December, 1971, there were over 300 methadone projects
and a large number of persons receiving methadone by prescription
outside of these projects. An estimated 50,000 patients are now
using this drug for maintenance. See Staff Paper 3. </p>

<p>8. In November, 1971, the Food and Drug Administration
announced it intention to propose broader approval of methadone
under a closely con trolled distribution system. </p>

<p>9. These estimates are based on an addict population of about
100,000 During 1971, official estimates of the number of addicts
were raised. It i now estimated that 100,000 to 120,000 pounds of
opium are needed annually to supply the U.S. market. </p>

<p>10. In June, 1971, the President proposed a Special Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention to coordinate federal drug-abuse
efforts in treatment, education, and research. Regulation and law
enforcement, and military and veterans' problems are not
included.<br>
