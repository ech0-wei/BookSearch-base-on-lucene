<h3>Report on Australian Hemp Trials from James Davis to Joe

<br>
Dear Fellow Farmer,<br>
<br>
I have been trialling fibre hemp this season and am delighted to
confirm that<br>
it is a very clean and easy crop to grow. It takes about 60 days
from<br>
seeding to harvest and should yield around three tonne of milled
fibre per<br>
hectar. We are expecting to get around $700 per tonne for the
fibre. On a<br>
commercial scale we estimate that it will cost around $260 per
tonne to<br>
produce. The crop requires fertile, well drained soils and
irrigation,<br>
although the first crop received 125mm of rainfall and we only
had to apply<br>
75mm of irrigation. That means the crop requires less water than
wheat to<br>
produce a comparable yield for a product worth twice as much.<br>
<br>
We could expect to grow at least two crops per year and probably
three making<br>
it more profitable than even tobacco.<br>
<br>
We cultivated the soil to a fine seed bed and sowed on the flat.
The first<br>
crop successfully smothered all weeds including dock, summer
grass, wild<br>
raddish and Datura. A corn crop planted next to the hemp did NOT
survive the<br>
weeds.<br>
<br>
In the latter stages of growth the flower heads attracted
Heliothus<br>
caterpillars but no treatment was necessary prior to harvest.<br>
<br>
For a fast growing crop, fertiliser is essential and hemp is no
exception.<br>
<br>
We are developing a milling machine and apart from this, fibre
hemp can be<br>
cultivated and harvested with normal farm equipment.<br>
<br>
I look forward to growing this environmentally friendly and
potentially<br>
profitable crop and hope you will join me in this exciting
venture.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
James Davis<br>

government<br>
departments involved in issuing the growing permits.<br>
<br>
HAMISH DENNIS<br>
<br>
Hamish is a horticultural undergraduate at Melbourne University
(Burnley<br>
Campus) and has performed all the monitoring, data collection and
analysis<br>
activities of the program. He has been conducting a number of
experiments<br>
relating to the processing requirements of hemp.<br>
<br>
ADRIAN CLARKE<br>
<br>
Adrian is a professional lobbyist and was responsible for
bringing about the<br>
situation that has allowed trial permits to be issued and this
crop to be<br>
grown. He has been active in developing Australian and export
markets for<br>
hemp at varying stages of processing<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Varietal Section:<br>

4-7 weeks of cutting and windrowing; 3-4 weeks of baling.<br>
<br>
Yields Estimates:<br>
<br>
5 to 20 tonnes. Average U.K. trials 10 tonne/ha.<br>
Commercial crops average 6 tonne/ha.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Achievements at &quot;The Aspens&quot;, Porepunkah.<br>
<br>
The French varieties were sown on October 28, 1995 at 80kg per ha
in a split<br>
plot randomized trial with six replicates. The second part of the
trial was<br>
sown on November 28, 1995. The four eastern European varieties
were sown in<br>
a supplementary randomised trial with three replicates.<br>
<br>
The ground was ripped rotary hoed and cultivated three weeks
prior to sowing.<br>
Two tonne/ha of lime was incorporated with 100kg of Nitrogen 40kg
of<br>
Phosphorus and 40kg of potassium as a blend of Pivot, DAP,
Ammonium Nitrate<br>
and Muriate of Potash.<br>
No herbicides were used.<br>
<br>
The crop was sown with a cone seeder (specially developed for
trials by<br>
Agriculture Victoria). Soil temperature was 14 degrees. There was
good<br>
sub-soil moisture following excellent spring rains. Fifteen mm of
irrigation<br>
was applied after seeding and germination occurred in five days.<br>
<br>
125 mm of rain fell on the crop and a further 60 mm of irrigation
was applied<br>
during December.<br>
The crop grew rapidly, achieving 5 cm per day after thirty days,
to a<br>
harvestable height of 1.8m. All weeds were suppressed by the
crop.<br>
<br>
The time of harvest was determined by flowering (a requirement of
the permit<br>
was to harvest before seedset).<br>
Ag Vic. sampled the crop at flowering for forensic analysis, the
subsequent<br>
results of which showed less than 0.3% THC.<br>
<br>
Harvesting was carried out on December 28, 1995. Because of the
plot size<br>
and split nature of the trial, brush cutters were used to fell
the crop. The<br>
produce from each plot was picked up by hand and weighed.<br>
Samples were taken for dry matter analysis and the results from
this activity<br>
used to calculate the production per hectare.<br>
<br>
There was very little difference between all of the French
varieties with<br>
some favour being attributed to Felina.<br>
Average yields were around 11 tonnes per ha of dry matter
translating to<br>
marketable commodity of seven (7) tones/ha.<br>
<br>
No significant pests or diseases were observed. Heliothus
caterpillars<br>
appeared on the flowering heads just before harvest but did not
require any<br>
treatment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Economics per tonne per ha<br>
Grow, harvest, manage and secure $190 $1,330<br>
Harvesting &amp; Storage Cost $ 50 $ 350<br>
Total cost/ha based on 7 tonne yield $240 $1,680<br>
Farm gate price required for whole stalk $450 $3,160<br>
CULTIVATION OF FIBRE HEMP<br>
<br>
TRIALS AND TRIBULATION FOR THE CLARKE HEMP CONSORTIUM<br>
<br>
Industrial Hemp is produced from annual plant (Cannabis Sativa)
and can be<br>
processed into a number of products ranging from textiles, paper
and<br>
construction materials from the outer bark (fibre) to furniture,
paints and<br>
plastics from the hurd or core and lubricants, food and medicines
from the<br>
seed.<br>
Combinations of the whole plant can be manufactured into a mulch
mat with<br>
wide spread uses in the landscape gardening, land reclamation and
pet care<br>
industries.<br>
<br>
Although hemp has been cultivated around the world for millennia,
modern day<br>
attention to the crop has been limited to Asian and Eastern
European<br>
countries.<br>
Currently the growing of Cannabis sativa is illegal in Australia
and most<br>
other western nations with the notable exceptions of France,
Holland, England<br>
and Canada.<br>
<br>
In late 1995 the Victorian Government issued a number of permits
to various<br>
commercial and regional groups to conduct trials on the growing
of industrial<br>
hemp. Sites were chosen for their security and suitability to
hemp growing.<br>
The judgement on suitability was based on growing conditions
known to be<br>
successful overseas and in Tasmania where trials have been going
on for three<br>
years.<br>
<br>
The North East region of Victoria fits the prescribe growing
conditions so we<br>
proceeded to incorporate the crop into a summer cropping.
Following are the<br>
agronomic requirements specified for industrial hemp and our
results.<br>
<br>
Agronomic Specification for Industrial Hemp<br>
<br>
Climate &amp; Environment:<br>
Frost susceptible, high humidity increases fungal attack. Wind
and heavy<br>
rain damages crops but need moderated wind to enhance fibre
strength.<br>
Deep rooted crop-providing a good disease break and improving
soil structure.<br>
120 day crop with critical harvest period.<br>
Rabbits and insects attack Hemp.<br>
Retting required before harvest.<br>
Security required.<br>
<br>
Soils &amp; Seedbed Preparation<br>
Well drained alluvial sandy loam - pH 6.5-7<br>
High organic matter<br>
High Nitrogen demand (120 kg/ha)<br>
High Phosphorus demand in early stages (120 kg/ha)<br>
Moderate Potassium (160 kg/ha)<br>
<br>
Cultivate to a fine tilth and pre-drill fertiliser. Herbicide
usage - pre<br>
and post-emergent.<br>

<h1>Hemp Facts 1 - 10 </h1>

<p><b>By Alan D. Bryan</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. HEMP FOR FUEL:</b> </p>

<p>About 6% of contiguous United States land area put into
cultivation for biomass could supply all current demands for oil
and gas. Very few people know what &quot;biomass conversion&quot;
or &quot;pyrolysis&quot; mean--not only in terms of their
dictionary definitions, but in terms of what they mean as
alternative sources of energy, to the limited, expensive and
dirty petro-chemical, nuclear, or coal sources. The only reason
the U.S.-- and every other nation on earth--can't once again
become energy independent and smog free is because people are not
educated concerning the facts about solutions to the
environment/energy &quot;crisis&quot; continuously lamented and
tepidly addressed &quot;leaders&quot;, claiming they are the best
informed to decide what to do. The knowledge exists right now for
our lifeline to the future and the health and well-being of the
Seventh Generation yet unborn. Everyone of us must learn about
this existent lifeline and teach everyone else we know what the
facts are the way out of the current &quot;crisis&quot;. </p>

<p>HEMP IS THE NUMBER ONE biomass producer on earth: 10 tons per
acre in approximately four months. It is a woody plant containing
77% cellulose. Wood producers 60% cellulose. This energy crop can
be harvested with equipment readily available. It can be
&quot;cubed&quot; by modifying cubing equipment. This </p>

<p>method condenses the bulk, reducing trucking costs from the
field to the pyrolysis reactor. And the biomass cubes are ready
for conversion. </p>

<p>Hemp is drought resistant, making it an ideal crop in the dry
western regions of the country. Hemp is the only biomass resource
capable of making America energy independent and our government
outlawed it in 1938. </p>

<p>The argument against hemp production does not hold up to
scrutiny: hemp grown for biomass makes very poor grade marijuana.
The 20-40 million Americans who smoke marijuana would loath to
smoke hemp grown for biomass, so a farmer's hemp biomass crop is
worthless as marijuana. </p>

edition p. 136 </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #2 </h3>

<p><b>Dewey and Merrill, &quot;bulletin #404, Hemp Hurds As
Paper-Making Material&quot; U.S.D.A. Washington, D.C. Oct. 14,
1916.</b> </p>

<p>There appears to be little doubt that under the present system
of forest use and consumption the present supply cannot withstand
the demands placed upon it. By the time improved methods of
forestry have established an equilibrium between production and
consumption, the price of pulp wood may be such that a knowledge
of other raw materials may be imperative. </p>

<p>Semi-commercial paper-making tests were conducted, therefore,
on hemp hurds, in cooperation with a paper manufacturer. After
several trials, under conditions of treatment and manufacture
which are regarded as favorable in comparison with those used
with pulp wood, paper was produced which received </p>

<p>very favorable comment both from investigators and from the
trade which according to official tests would be classified as
No. 1 finished printing paper. (p. 25) </p>

<p>The new paper process used hemp &quot;hurds&quot;--77% of the
hemp stalk's weight, which was then a wasted by-product of the
fiber-stripping process. In 1916, USDA Bulletin #404, reported
that ONE ACRE OF CANNABIS HEMP, in annual rotation over a 20-year
period, WOULD PRODUCE AS MUCH PULP FOR PAPER AS 4.1 ACRES OF
TREES BEING CUT DOWN over the same 20 year period. This process
would use only 1/4 to 1/7 as much polluting sulfur-based acid
chemicals to break down the lignin that binds the fibers of the
pulp, or even none at all using soda ash. The problem of dioxin
contamination of rivers is avoided in the hemp making process.
HEMP PROVIDES FOUR TIMES AS MUCH PULP WITH AT LEAST 4-7 TIMES
LESS POLLUTION. </p>

<p>As an example: If the new (1916) hemp pulp paper process were
legal today, it would soon replace about 70% of all wood paper,
including computer printout paper, corrugated boxes and paper
bags. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #3 </h3>

<p><b>Pinch Hitters for Defense - Popular Mechanics - December
1941</b> </p>

<p>Over in England it's saccharine for sugar; on the continent
it's charcoal &quot;gasogenes&quot; in the rumble seat instead of
gasoline in the tank. Here in America there's plenty of sugar,
plenty of gasoline. Yet there's an industrial revolution in
progress just the same, a revolution in materials that will
affect every home. </p>

<p>After 12 years of research, the Ford Motor Company has
completed an experimental automobile with a plastic body.
Although its design takes advantages of the properties of
plastics, the streamline car does not differ greatly in
appearance from its steel counterpart. The only steel in the
hand-made body is found in the tubular welded frame on which are
mounted 14 plastic panels, 3/16&quot; thick. Composed of a
mixture of farm crops and synthetic chemicals, the plastic is
reported to withstand a blow 10 times as great as steel without
denting. Even the windows are of plastic. The total weight of the
plastic car is about 2,000 lbs., compared with 3,000 lbs. for a
steel auto of the same size. Although no hint has been given as
to when plastic cars may go into production, the experimental
model is pictured as a step toward materialization of Henry
Ford's belief that some day he would &quot;grow automobiles from
the soil&quot;. </p>

<p>When Henry Ford recently unveiled his plastic car, the result
of 12 years of research, he gave the world a glimpse of the
automobile of tomorrow, it's tough panel molded under hydraulic
pressure of 1500 lbs. per square inch from a recipe that calls
for 70% of cellulose fibers from wheat straw, HEMP, and sisal
plus 30% resin binder. The only steel in the car is its tubular
welded frame. The plastic car weighs a ton less than a comparable
steel car. Manufacturers are already taking a low-priced plastic
car to test the public's taste by 1943. </p>

<p>Poster's note: If anyone remembers this process, I would be
interested in hearing comments. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #4 </h3>

<p><b>Paints and Varnishes</b> </p>

<p>For thousands of years, virtually all good paints and
varnishes were made with hemp seed oil and/or linseed oil. </p>

<p>For instance, in 1935 alone, 116 million lbs. [National
Institute of Oilseed Products congressional testimony *against*
the 1937 Marijuana Transfer Tax Law] of hemp seed were used in
America just for paint and varnish. As a comparison, consider
that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, along with all America's
state and local police agencies, claim to have seized for all of
1988, 651.5 tons of American-grown marijuana--seed, plant, root,
dirt clump and all. [National Narcotics Intelligence (duh)
Consumer's Committee, NNICC Report, 1988 DEA Office Release, El
Paso, TX, April, 1989.] The hemp drying oil business went
principally to DuPont petro-chemicals/[Slomand, Larry,
&quot;Reefer Madness&quot; Grove Press N.Y, N.Y. 1979, pg 72]. </p>

<p>Congress and the Treasury Dept. were assured through SECRET
TESTIMONY given by DuPont in 1935-37 directly to Herman Oliphant,
Chief Counsel for the Treasury Dept., that hemp seed oil could be
replaced with synthetic petro-chemical oils MADE PRINCIPALLY BY
DUPONT. (Poster's note: Sound like a conspiracy.) </p>

<p>Oliphant was solely responsible for drafting the Marijuana Tax
Act that was submitted to Congress.[Richard Bonnie and Charles
Whitebread, &quot;The Marijuana Conviction&quot;, Univ. of
Virginia Press 1974]. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #5 </h3>

<p><b>Building Materials and Housing</b> </p>

<p>Because one acre of hemp produces as much cellouse fiber pulp
as 4.1 acres of trees (Dewey &amp; Merrill, &quot;Bulletin
#404,&quot; U.S. Dept Ag., 1916), hemp is the perfect material to
replace trees for pressed board, particle board and core concrete
construction molds. </p>

<p>Pratical, inexpensive construction material which is fire
resistant, with excellent thermal and sound insulating qualities,
can be made using a process called Environcore(c). This process,
developed by Mansion Industries, applies heat and compression to
agricultural fiber to create strong contruction </p>

<p>paneling, replacing dry wall and plywood. </p>

<p>Hemp has been used throughout history for carpet backing. Hemp
fiber has potential in the manufacture of strong, rot resistant
carpeting--eliminalting the poisonous fumes of burning synthetic
materials in a house or commerical fire, along with allergic
reactions associated with new synthetic carpeting. </p>

<p>Plastic plumbing pipe (PVC) can be manufactured using
renewable hemp cellulose as the chemical feedstocks, replacing
non-renewable petroleum-based chemical feedstocks. </p>

<p>So we can envision a house of the future built, plumbed,
painted and furnished with THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE RENEWABLE
SOURCE--HEMP. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #6 </h3>

<p><b>HEMP FOR VICTORY</b> </p>

<p>Transcript of the original 1942 U.S.D.A. film, &quot;Hemp for
Victory&quot; extolling some of the many uses of this ancient
plant and premier world resource. </p>

<p>Long ago when these ancient Grecian temples were new, hemp was
already old in the service of mankind. For thousands of years,
even then, this plant had been grown for cordage and cloth in
china and elsewhere in the East. For centuries prior to about
1850 all the ships that sailed the western seas were rigged with
hempen rope and sails. For the sailor, no less that the hangman,
hemp was indispensable. </p>

<p>A 44-gun frigate like our cherished Old Ironsides took over 60
tons of hemp for rigging, including an anchor cable of 25&quot;
in circumference. The Conestoga wagons and prairie schooners of
pioneer days were covered with hemp canvas. Indeed the very word
canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp. In those days hemp
was an important crop in Kentucky and Missouri. Then came cheaper
imported fibers for cordage, like jute, sisal and Manila hemp,
and the culture of hemp in America declined. </p>

<p>But now with Philippine and East Indian hemp in the hands of
the Japanese, and shipment of jute from India curtailed, American
hemp must meet the needs of our Army and Navy as well as of our
Industry. In 1942, patriotic farmers at the government's request
planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an increase of several
thousand percent. The goal for 1943 is 50,000 acres of seed hemp.
</p>

<p>In Kentucky much of the hemp acreage is on river bottom land
such as this. Some of these fields are inaccessible except by
boat. Thus plans are afoot for a great expansion of a hemp
industry as a part of the war program. This film is designed to
tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now little known
outside Kentucky and Wisconsin. </p>

<p>This is hemp seed. Be careful how you use it. For to grow hemp
legally you must have federal registration and tax stamp. This is
provided for in your contract. Ask your county agent about it. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #7 </h3>

<p><b>Introduction from &quot;Marijuana: Medical Papers,&quot;
Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.,</b> </p>

<p>Medi-Comp Press, 1973, pp. xiii-xxvii, describing some of the
recent history of western medical explorations into the salutory
medicinal benefits of hemp drugs_a history that is almost
completely unknown to people at the end of the 20th century, but,
throughout the majority of the 19th century, was commonly known
and experienced by much of the population: </p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> </p>

<p>Medicine in the Western World has forgotten almost all it once
knew about therapeutic properties of marijuana, or cannabis. </p>

<p>Analgesia, anticonvulsant action, appetite stimulation,
ataraxia, antibiotic properties and low toxicity were described
throughout medical literature, beginning in 1839, when
O'Shaughnessy introduced cannabis into the Western pharmacopoeia.
</p>

<p>As these findings were reported throughout Western medicine,
cannabis attained wide use. Cannabis therapy was described in
most pharmacopoeial texts as a treatment for a variety of disease
conditions. </p>

<p>During the second half of the 1800s and in the present
century, medical researchers in some measure corroborated the
early reports of the therapeutic potential of cannabis. In
addition, much laboratory research has been concerned with
bioassay, determination of the mode of action, and attempts to
solve the </p>

<p>problems of insolubility in water and variability of strength
among different cannabis specimens. </p>

<p>&quot;Recreational&quot; smoking of cannabis in the twentieth
century and the resultant restrictive federal legislation have
functionally ended all medical uses of marijuana. </p>

<p>In light of such assets as minimal toxicity, no buildup of
tolerance, no physical dependence, and minimal autonomic
disturbance, immediate major clinical reinvestigation of cannabis
preparations is indicated in the management of pain, chronic
neurologic diseases, convulsive disorders, migraine headache,
anorexia, </p>

<p>mental illness, and bacterial infections. </p>

<p>Recently declassified secret U.S. Defense Department studies
reconfirm marijuana's congeners to have therapeutic utility. </p>

<p>Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis americana, Indian
hemp and marijuana (or marihuana) all refer to the same plant.
Cannabis is used throughout the world for diverse purposes and
has a long history </p>

<p>characterized by usefulness, euphoria or evil_depending on
one's point of view. To the agriculturist cannabis is a fiber
crop; to the physician of a century ago it was a valuable
medicine; to the physician of today it is an enigma; to the user,
a euphoriant; to the police, a menace; to the traffickers, a
source of profitable danger; to the convict or parolee and his
family, a source of sorrow. </p>

<p>This book is concerned primarily with the medicinal aspects of
cannabis. </p>

<p>The Chinese emperor Shen-nung is reported to have taught his
peopleto grow hemp for fiber in the twenty-eighth century B.C. A
text fromthe period 1500-1200 B.C. documents a knowledge of the
plant in China--but not for use as fiber. In 200 A.D., the use of
cannabis as an analgesic was described by the physician
Hoa-tho.[44] </p>

<p>In India the use of hemp preparations as a remedy was
described before 1000 B.C. In Persia, cannabis was known several
centuries before Christ. In Assyria, about 650 B.C., its
intoxicating properties were noted.[44] Except for Herodotus'
report that the Scythians used the smoke from burning hemp seeds
for intoxication, the ancient Greeks seemed to be unaware of the
psychoactive properties of cannabis. Dioscorides in the first
century A.D. rendered an accurate morphologic description of the
plant, but made no note of it's intoxicating properties. </p>

<p><b>More Info on Medical Uses.</b> </p>

<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Arabic writers
described the social use of cannabis and resultant cruel but
unsuccessful attempts to suppress its non-medical use. [44]
Although Galen described the use of the seeds for creating
warmth, he did not describe the intoxicating qualities of hemp.
Of interest is the paucity of references to hemp's intoxicating
properties in the lay and medical literature of Europe before the
1800s.[44] The therapeutic use of cannabis was introduced into
Western medicine in 1839, in a forty-page article by W. B.
O'Shaughnessy, a thirty-year-old physician serving with the
British in India.[27] </p>

<p>His discussion of the history of the use of cannabis products
in the East reveals an awareness that these drugs had not only
been used in medicine for therapeutic purposes, but had also been
used for recreational and religious purposes. </p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy is not primarily known for his discovery of hemp
drugs, but rather for his basic studies on intravenous
electrolyte therapy in 1831, and his introduction of the
telegraph into India in the 1850s.[26] After studying the
literature on cannabis and conferring with contemporary Hindu and
Mohammedan </p>

<p>scholars O'Shaughnessy tested the effects of various hemp
preparations on animals, before attempting to use them to treat
humans. Satisfied that the drug was reasonably safe, he
administered preparations of cannabis extract to patients, and
discovered that it had analgesic and sedative properties. </p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy successfully relieved the pain of rheumatism and
stilled the convulsions of an infant with this strange new drug.
His most spectacular success came, however, when he quelled the
wrenching muscle spasms of tetanus and rabies with the fragrant
resin. Psychic effects resembling a curious delirium, when an
overdose was given, were treated with strong purgatives, emetics
with a blister to the nape of the neck, and leeches on the
temples.[27] </p>

<p>The use of cannabis derivatives for medicinal purposes spread
rapidly throughout Western medicine, as is evidenced in the
report of the Committee on Cannabis Indica of the Ohio State
Medical Society, published in 1860. In that report physicians
told of success in treating stomach pain, childbirth psychosis,
chronic cough, and gonorrhea with hemp products.[25] </p>

<p>A Dr. Fronmueller, of Fuerth, Ohio, summarized his experiences
with the drug as follows: </p>

<p>I have used hemp many hundred times to relieve local pains of
an inflammatory as well as neuralgic nature, and judging from
these experiments, I have to assign to the Indian hemp a place
among the so-called hypnotic medicines next to opium; its effects
are less intense, and the secretions are not so much suppressed
by it. Digestion is not disturbed; the appetite rather increased;
sickness of the stomach seldom induced; congestion never. Hemp
may consequently be employed in inflammatory conditions. It
disturbs the expectoration far less than opium; the nervous
system is also not so much affected. The whole effect of hemp
being less violent, and producing a more natural sleep, without
interfering with the actions of the internal organs, it is
certainly often preferable to opium, although it is not equal to
that drug in strength and reliability. An alternating course of
opium and Indian hemp seems particularly adapted to those cases
where opium alone fails in producing the desired effect. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #9 </h3>

<p><b>More Interesting Medical Stuff</b> </p>

<p>Because cannabis did not lead to physical dependence, it was
found to be superior to the opiates for a number of therapeutic
purposes. Birch, in 1889, reported success in treating opiate and
chloral addiction with cannabis,[5] and Mattison in 1891
recommended its use to the young physician, comparing it
favorably with the opiates. He quoted his colleague Suckling: </p>

<p>With a wish for speedy effect, it is so easy to use that
modern mischief-maker, hypodermic morphia, that they [young
physicians] are prone to forget remote results of incautious
opiate giving. </p>

<p>Would that the wisdom which has come to their professional
fathers through, it may be, a hapless experience, might serve
them to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient
has gone awreck. </p>

<p>Indian hemp is not here lauded as a specific. It will, at
times, fail. So do other drugs. But the many cases in which it
acts well, entitle it to a large and lasting confidence. </p>

<p>My experience warrants this statement: cannabis indica is,
often, a safe and successful anodyne and hypnotic.[23] In their
study of the medical applications of cannabis, physicians of the
nineteenth century repeatedly encountered a number of
difficulties. Recognizing the therapeutic potential of the drug,
many experimenters sought ways of overcoming these drawbacks to
its use in medicine, in particular the following: </p>

<p>Cannabis products are insoluble in water. </p>

<p>The onset of the effects of medicinal preparations of cannabis
takes an hour or so; its action is therefore slower than that of
many other drugs. Different batches of cannabis derivatives vary
greatly in strength; moreover, the common procedure for
standardization of cannabis samples, by administration to test
animals, is subject to error owing to variability of reactions
among the animals. </p>

<p>There is wide variation among humans in their individual
responses to cannabis. Despite these problems regarding the
uncertainty of potency and dosage and the difficulties in mode of
administration, cannabis has several important advantages over
other substances used as analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotics: </p>

<p>The prolonged use of cannabis does not lead to the development
of physical dependence. [11, 13, 14, 24, 39, 44] There is minimal
development of tolerance to cannabis products. (Loewe notes a
slight &quot;beginner's </p>

<p>habituation&quot; in dogs, during the first few trials with
the drug, as the only noticeable tolerance effect.[20]) [11, 13,
14, 24, 44] Cannabis products have exceedingly low toxicity.[9,
21, 22, 24] (The oral dose required to kill a mouse has been
found to be about 40,000 times the dose required to produce
typical symptoms of intoxication in man.)[21] Cannabis produces
no disturbance of vegetative functioning, whereas the opiates
inhibit the gastrointestinal tract, the flow of bile and the
cough reflex.[1, 2, 24, 44, 46] Besides investigating the
physical effects of medicinal preparations of cannabis,
nineteenth-century physicians observed the psychic effects of the
drug in its therapeutic applications.[4, 27, 33] They found that
cannabis first mildly stimulates, and then sedates the higher
centers of the brain. Hare suggested in 1887 a possible mechanism
of cannabis' analgesic properties: During the time that this
remarkable drug is relieving pain a very curious psychical
condition manifests itself; namely, that the diminution of the
pain seems to be due to its fading away in the distance, so that
the pain becomes less and less, just as the pain in a delicate
ear would grow less and less as a beaten drum was carried farther
and farther out of the range of hearing. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT of the Day #10 </h3>

<p><b>Even more good medical stuff....</b> </p>

<p>In his definitive survey of the literature and report of his
own studies, deceptively titled &quot;Marihuana, America's New
Drug Problem,&quot; Walton notes that cannabis was widely used
during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and
particularly before new drugs were developed: </p>

<p>This popularity of the hemp drugs can be attributed partly to
the fact that they were introduced before the synthetic hypnotics
and analgesics. Chloral hydrate was not introduced until 1869 and
was followed in the next thirty years by paraldehyde, sulfonal
and the barbitals. Antipyrine and acetanilide, the first of their
particular group of analgesics, were introduced about 1884. For
general sedative and analgesic purposes, the only drugs commonly
used at this time were the morphine derivatives and their
disadvantages were very well known. In fact, the most attractive
feature of the hemp narcotics was probably the fact that they did
not exhibit certain of the notorious disadvantages of the
opiates. The hemp narcotics do not constipate at all, they more
often increase than decrease appetite, they do not particularly
depress the respiratory center even in large doses, they rarely
or never cause pruritis or cutaneous eruptions and, most
important, the liability of developing addiction is very much
less than with opiates.[44] The use of cannabis in American
medicine was seriously affected by the increased use of opiates
in the latter half of the nineteenth century. </p>

<p>With the introduction of the hypodermic syringe into American
medicine from England in 1856 by Barker and Ruppaner, the use of
the faster acting, water-soluble opiate drugs rapidly increased.
The Civil War helped to spread the use of opiates in this
country; the injected drugs were administered widely-and often
indiscriminately-to relieve the pain of maimed soldiers returning
from combat. (Opiate addiction was once called the &quot;army
disease.&quot;[41]) As the use of injected opiates increased,
cannabis declined in popularity. </p>

<p>Cannabis preparations were still widely available in legend
and over-the-counter forms in the 1930s. Crump (Chairman,
Investigating Committee, American Medical Association) in 1931
mentioned the proprietaries &quot;Piso's Cure,&quot; &quot;One
Day Cough Cure&quot; and &quot;Neurosine&quot; as containing
cannabis.[44] In 1937 Sasman listed twenty-eight pharmaceuticals
containing cannabis.[36] Cannabis was still recognized as a
medicinal agent in that year, when the committee on legislative
activities of the American Medical Association concluded as
follows: </p>

<p>. . . there is positively no evidence to indicate the abuse of
cannabis as a medicinal agent or to show that its medicinal use
is leading to the development of cannabis addiction. Cannabis at
the present time is slightly used for medicinal purposes, but it
would seem worthwhile to maintain its status as a medicinal agent
for such purposes as it now has. There is a possibility that a
re-study of the drug by modern means may show other advantages to
be derived from its medicinal use.[32] Meanwhile, in Mexico, the
poor were smoking marijuana to relax and to endure heat and
fatigue. (Originally marijuana was the Mexican slang word for the
smoking preparation of dried leaves and flowering tops of the
Cannabis sativa plant-the indigenous variety of the hemp plant.) </p>

<p><b>More Misc. Med. Stuff.... Coming soon--How Hemp Saved
George Bush</b> </p>

<p>The recreational smoking of marijuana may have started in this
country in New Orleans in about 1910, and continued on a small
scale there until 1926, when a newspaper ran a six-part series on
the use of the drug.[44] The fad subsequently spread up the
Mississippi and throughout the United States, faster than local
and state laws could be passed to discourage it. The use of
&quot;tea&quot; or &quot;muggles&quot; blossomed into a minor
&quot;psychedelic revolution&quot; of the 1920s. Narcotics
officers encouraged the enactment of local prohibitory laws and
eventually succeeded in bringing about restrictive Federal
legislation. In 1937 Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act, the
finale to a series of prohibitory acts in the individual states.
Under the new laws, the already dwindling use of cannabis as a
therapeutic substance in medicine was brought to a virtual halt.
In 1941, cannabis was dropped from the &quot;National Formulary
and Pharmacopoeia.&quot; </p>

<p>Around the time of the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,
Walton postulated sites of action for cannabis drugs. Cortical
areas, he found, are affected at low dosage, while at high dosage
there seems to be a depressant effect on the thalamo-cortical
pathways. Hyperemia of the brain appears to be a local
phenomenon, unless centers controlling vasodilation might be
located in the thalamo-cortical region. Similar possible
mechanisms are suggested for the phenomenon of mild hypoglycemia,
usual hunger and thirst and occasional lacrimation and
nausea.[44] </p>

<p>Despite restrictive legislation, a few medical researchers
have had the opportunity to continue the investigation of the
therapeutic applications of cannabis in recent years. In his
study of the medical applications of cannabis for Mayor La
Guardia's committee, Dr. Samuel Allentuck reported, among other
findings, favorable results in treating withdrawal of opiate
addicts with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful purified
product of the hemp plant.[1, 24] An article in 1949, buried in a
journal of chemical abstracts, reported that a substance related
to THC controlled epileptic seizures in a group of children more
effectively than diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin_ref ), a most

<p><b>Marijuana MYTH # 1 Marijuana causes brain damage</b> </p>

<p>The most celebrated study that claims to show brain damage is
the rhesus monkey study of Dr. Robert Heath, done in the late
1970s. This study was reviewed by a distinguished panel of
scientists sponsored by the Institute of Medicine and the
National Academy of Sciences. Their results were published under
the title, Marijuana and Health in 1982. Heath's work was sharply
criticized for its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys),
its failure to control experimental bias, and the
misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as
&quot;damaged&quot;. Actual studies of human populations of
marijuana users have shown no evidence of brain damage. For
example, two studies from 1977, published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association (JAMA) showed no evidence of brain
damage in heavy users of marijuana. That same year, the American
Medical Association (AMA) officially came out in favor of
decriminalizing marijuana. That's not the sort of thing you'd
expect if the AMA thought marijuana damaged the brain. </p>

marijuana). Nahas' generalizations from his petri dishes to human
beings have been rejected by the scientific community as being
invalid. In the case of the animal experiments, the animals that
survived their ordeal returned to normal within 30 days of the
end of the experiment. Studies of actual human populations have
failed to demonstrate that marijuana adversely affects the
reproductive system. </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth # 3.Marijuana is a &quot;gateway&quot; drug
it leads to hard drugs.</b> </p>

<p>This is one of the more persistent myths. A real world example
of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be found
in Holland. The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the 1970s.
Since then, hard drug use heroin and cocaine have DECLINED
substantially. If marijuana really were a gateway drug, one would
have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not down. This
apparent &quot;negative gateway&quot; effect has also been
observed in the United States. Studies done in the early 1970s
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of
alcohol. A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had
not, found that where marijuana was more available the states
that had decriminalized hard drug abuse as measured by emergency
room episodes decreased. In short, what science and actual
experience tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the
much more dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #5. - Marijuana is much more dangerous than
tobacco.</b> </p>

<p>Smoked marijuana contains about the same amount of carcinogens
as does an equivalent amount of tobacco. It should be remembered,
however, that a heavy tobacco smoker consumes much more tobacco
than a heavy marijuana smoker consumes marijuana. This is because
smoked tobacco, with a 90% addiction rate, is the most addictive
of all drugs while marijuana is less addictive than caffeine. Two
other factors are important. The first is that paraphernalia laws
directed against marijuana users make it difficult to smoke
safely. These laws make water pipes and bongs, which filter some
of the carcinogens out of the smoke, illegal and, hence,
unavailable. The second is that, if marijuana were legal, it
would be more economical to have cannabis drinks like bhang (a
traditional drink in the Middle East) or tea which are totally
non-carcinogenic. This is in stark contrast with
&quot;smokeless&quot; tobacco products like snuff which can cause
cancer of the mouth and throat. When all of these facts are taken
together, it can be clearly </p>

<p>seen that the reverse is true: marijuana is much SAFER than
tobacco. </p>

Nicotine Addiction, Surgeon General's Report, 1988. In Health

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #6. Legal marijuana would cause carnage on
the highways.</b> </p>

<p>Although marijuana, when used to intoxication, does impair
performance in a manner similar to alcohol, actual studies of the
effect of marijuana on the automobile accident rate suggest that
it poses LESS of a hazard than alcohol. When a random sample of
fatal accident victims was studied, it was initially found that
marijuana was associated with RELATIVELY as many accidents as
alcohol. In other words, the number of accident victims
intoxicated on marijuana relative to the number of marijuana
users in society gave a ratio similar to that for accident
victims intoxicated on alcohol relative to the total number of
alcohol users. However, a closer examination of the victims
revealed that around 85% of the people intoxicated on marijuana
WERE ALSO INTOXICATED ON ALCOHOL. For people only intoxicated on
marijuana, the rate was much lower than for alcohol alone. This
finding has been supported by other research using completely
different methods. For example, an economic analysis of the
effects of decriminalization on marijuana usage found that states
that had reduced penalties for marijuana possession experienced a
rise in marijuana use and a decline in alcohol use with the
result that fatal highway accidents decreased. This would suggest
that, far from causing &quot;carnage&quot;, legal marijuana might
actually save lives. </p>

that the Partnership faked the flat &quot;marijuana

<p>Hemp FACT #21-Marijuana Myths </p>

<p>Date: 95-02-01 10:46:56 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #8. Marijuana is more potent today than in
the past</b> </p>

<p>This myth is the result of bad data. The researchers who made
the claim of increased potency used as their baseline the THC
content of marijuana seized by police in the early 1970s. Poor
storage of this marijuana in un-air conditioned evidence rooms
caused it to deteriorate and decline in potency before any
chemical assay was performed. Contemporaneous, independent assays
of unseized &quot;street&quot; marijuana from the early 1970s
showed a potency equivalent to that of modern &quot;street&quot;
marijuana. Actually, the most potent form of this drug that was
generally available was sold legally in the 1920s and 1930s by
the pharmaceutical company Smith-Klein under the name,
&quot;American Cannabis&quot;. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #22-Marijuana Myths </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-02 10:59:16 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #9. Marijuana impairs short-term memory</b> </p>

<p>This is true but misleading. Any impairment of short-term
memory disappears when one is no longer under the influence of
marijuana. Often, the short-term memory effect is paired with a
reference to Dr. Heath's poor rhesus monkeys to imply that the
condition is permanent. </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #10. Marijuana lingers in the body like DDT</b>
</p>

<p>This is also true but misleading. Cannabinoids are fat soluble
as are innumerable nutrients and, yes, some poisons like DDT. For
example, the essential nutrient, Vitamin A, is fat soluble but
one never hears people who favor marijuana prohibition making
this comparison. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #23-Marijuana Myths </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-03 13:53:44 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>Marijuana Myth #11. There are over a thousand chemicals in
marijuana smoke</b> </p>

<p>Again, true but misleading. The 31 August 1990 issue of the
magazine Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemicals
present in roasted COFFEE, only 21 have actually been tested on
animals and 16 of these cause cancer in rodents. Yet, coffee
remains legal and is generally considered fairly safe. </p>

<p><b>Marijuana &quot;Myth&quot;#12. No one has ever died of a
marijuana overdose</b> </p>

<p>This is true. It was put in to see if you are paying
attention. Animal tests have revealed that extremely high doses
of cannabinoids are needed to have lethal effect. This has led
scientists to conclude that the ratio of the amount of
cannabinoids necessary to get a person intoxicated (i.e., stoned)
relative to the amount necessary to kill them is 1 to 40,000. In
other words, to overdose, you would have to consume 40,000 times
as much marijuana as you needed to get stoned. In contrast, the
ratio for alcohol varies between 1 to 4 and 1 to 10. It is easy
to see how upwards of 5000 people die from alcohol overdoses
every year and no one EVER dies of marijuana overdoses. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #24-A Book to Read </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-04 11:00:33 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO</b> </p>

<p>There is a book that tells the vast number of medical uses of
marijuana. It explains that many (not all) of the dangers we have
been warned about have been myths. The book is &quot;Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine&quot; by Lester Grinspoon, M.D., and James
B. Bakalar (1993). Obviously everything on this planet has its
dangers. Everything could be abused or used in a harmful way.
Anything could be addictive, but not everything is physically
addictive. Marijuana is not proven to be physically addictive.
The drug does not cause brain damage. It is also far less toxic
than many of today's prescription medicine. This book contains
stories written by patients that had experienced using marijuana
to help with their disease or disorder. It shows you the history
of the cannabis; why it was made a law, why people still believe
the myths, and why full legalization is necessary so the medical
users could obtain it cheap and without any trouble. Some people
are getting marijuana medication, but the vast majority of
medical marijuana users are still being arrested and serving long
prison terms without the proper medication (marijuana). </p>

<p>Here is a list of diseases and disorders marijuana helps: It
could help addicts of opiates, cigarette attics, probably many
more recuperate; cancer chemotherapy (it does not cause cancer),
glaucoma, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and
quadriplegia, AIDS, chronic pain, migraine, pruritis, menstrual
cramps and labor pain, depression and other mood disorders, and
many more. </p>

<p>Here is a description of the book from its jacket and a
paragraph from the very first page: </p>

<p>From the jacket: Much of the book consists of accounts written
by patients (including one from famed scientist Stephen Jay
Gould) that dramatically illustrate not only the relief provided
by marihuana but also the unnecessary distress caused by the need
to obtain it illegally. Grinspoon and Bakalar recount the long
history of medical marihuana use, discuss the real (as opposed to
fancied) potential health hazards of the drug, and analyze the
social causes of the government's insistence of making outlaws of
its medical users. They find that marihuana is a remarkably safe
substance and that criminalizing its use is costly, ineffective,
and unfair. They conclude that legalizing it for medical purposes
alone would be unworkable and that it must be given the same
status as alcohol--legal, with appropriate limitations, for use
by adults for any purpose. </p>

<p>From the first page: &quot;When I began to study marihuana in
1967, I had no doubt that it was a very harmful drug that was
unfortunately being used by more and more foolish young people
who would not listen to or could not understand the warnings
about its dangers. My purpose was to define scientifically the
nature and degree of those dangers. In the next three years, as I
reviewed the scientific, medical, and lay literature, my views
began to change. I came to understand that I, like so many other
people in this country, had been brainwashed. My beliefs about
the dangers of marihuana had little empirical foundation. By the
time I completed the research that formed the basis for a book, I
had become convinced that cannabis was considerably less harmful
than tobacco and alcohol, the most commonly used legal drugs. The
book was published in 1979; its title, Marihuana Reconsidered,
reflected my change in view.&quot; --Lester Grinspoon,M.D. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #25-U.K. Article.Pt.1 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-06 10:54:16 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Here's a portion of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. Read and Enjoy. Please remember that this
article was written in the UK all comments in ( ) are the
posters. </p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p><b>INSIDE STORY</b> </p>

<p><b>MEDICINE, MAN</b> </p>

<p>Since the Thirties cannabis has been taboo demonised as a
stepping stone to hard Drugs. Yet for centuries it was a
respected medicine. Now, people with ailments from multiple
sclerosis to glaucoma are clamouring for pot on prescription.
Could marijuana be a wonder drug for the Nineties? </p>

<p>ALEX KERSHAW investigates. </p>

<p>&quot;When I first took it the effects were dramatic. It was a
god-send. It's help with my spasticity, my bladder, taken away my
head sweats and gives me a much better night's sleep.&quot; A
year ago, 43-year-old David McGill was suffering chronic pain.
Depressed and insomniac, he had sunk to his lowest point since
being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1983. Then, last
November he heard about cannabis. He is just one of hundreds,
maybe thousands, who now use the drug regularly as a treatment
for MS and all sorts of other debilitating diseases. </p>

<p>Despite widespread use for thousands of years, cannabis's
secret medical history is only now being rediscovered in this
country, thanks in part to those battling against diseases for
which there is no known cure. Yet from 1842 to 1900, cannabis
made up half of all the medicine sold in America. </p>

<p>Robert Burton the English clergyman, first recommended
cannabis for depression in the Anatomy of Melancholy, published
in 1621. Queen Victoria used it to alleviate period pains. </p>

<p>A hundred odd years later, the use or supply of cannabis is,
of course, illegal. Next month, a Merseyside GP (General
Practitioner) is due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court charged
under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971. It is likely to be a test
case about the supply of cannabis out of medical necessity. The
case is the first of its kind in this country, but there have
been many similair presented in American courts. </p>

<p>Although the US Surgeon General, Jocelyn Elders, supports
cannabis for therapeutic use, the medical profession remains
bitterly divided over cannabis. Its political potency, it seems,
is as intoxicating as ever. And far more is at stake than
possible legalisation. The arguments over cannabis are also about
the efficacy of modern medicine, the futility of the government's
war on drugs and even the ecology of the planet itself. </p>

<p>Most evidence of cannabis's therapeutic value come from
America. Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine, for example written
by Dr Lester Grinspoon, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at
Harvard medical school, includes moving personal accounts of how
cannabis has alleviated epilepsy, the weight loss of Aids, the
nausea of chemotherapy, menstrual pains and multiple sclerosis. </p>

<p>Several glaucoma sufferers have found that using cannabis had
lowered the pressure within the eye, so averting the onset of
blindness. Robert Randall is one of them. In 1975, steep street
prices drove him to grow cannabis plants in his Washington home
&quot;just eight blocks from Capitol Hill&quot; to treat his
glaucoma. He was arrested, acquitted and then sued the American
government to obtain the first legal supply of cannabis in the
United States. </p>

<p>&quot;My defence was actually derived from English common
law,&quot; recalls Randall. &quot;Thirty five US states have
allowed the medical use of marihuana. In opinion polls, 80 per
cent of Americans support marijuana on prescription.&quot; Now
president of the US alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, Randall
was told in 1972 that his sight would last three years. Today his
glaucoma is no worse. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #26-U.K. Article.Pt 2 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-07 11:20:45 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Part Deux of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember, this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the posters. </p>

<p>A handful of patients with cancer or suffering chronic pain
have also won access. In 1990, a man known as Steve L becam the
first Aids patient to obtain the drug legally, 10 days before he
died. The same year, Aids patients Kenny Jenks and his wife,
Barbra, won the same right following their arrest for possesing
two cannabis plants. Ten armed narcotics officers had broken down
the door to their trailer home and held a gun to Barbra Jenks's
head. </p>

<p>Then, in 1991, James O Mason, head of America's Public Health
Service, suspended the programme which allowed the Jenkses and
others cannabis on compassionate grounds. Robert Randall, who
recieves a tin box every month crammed with 300 joints (!), is
one of only nine people in the US permitted a legal supply grown
on the US governments's marijuana plot at the University of
Mississipi. </p>

<p>&quot;We let doctors decide every day whether we are allowed
to take morphine and all kinds of dangerous drugs,&quot; said
Kenneth Jenks before he died on July 19. &quot;The decision to
take marijuana should be between the doctor and the
patient&quot;. </p>

<p>Jenks's sentiments are echoed by many in this country.
Sufferers from various ailments are turning to cannabis, often in
the last resort and in preference to legally prescribed,
sometimes highly toxic, drugs. Many suffering manic depressive
order, for example, complain the lithium carbonate robs them of
their creativity and vitality to the extent that they stop taking
it despite the potentially serious consequences. Cannabis, for
some, has proved an effective substitute. And for MS sufferes, in
particular, Dr. Lester Grinspoon insists, &quot;cannabis is the
drug of necessity.&quot; Desperate for relief, many swear it
helps to alleviate muscle spasms and other symptons. </p>

<p>&quot;It has completely changed my life,&quot; says Elizabeth
MacRory, who is 51 years old. Diagnosed as having MS in 1986
after a car accident, MacRory was told &quot;go home and get used
to it and don't read any books.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I joke that
I'll be the first woman in prison in a wheelchair,&quot; she
says. &quot;Cannabis has criminalised me but also liberated me.
It has helped with muscle spasms, allowed me to sleep properly
and helped control my bladder.&quot; </p>

<p>Clare Hodges , a 36-year-old mother of two, who has coped with
MS for 10 years, reports similair results. She runs the British
Association of Cannabis Therapeutics from her home in Leeds.
&quot;I now wake up in the morning and my balance is sensational.
I've been prescribed alll sorts of medicines. Most of the time I
felt I was being overdrugged, but with cannabis you can really
regulate the dosage. So-called experts are always quick to point
to the side-effects. But if you read about the possible effects
of aspirin, you'd never take it again,&quot; she says, lighting a
joint containing herbal tobacco. </p>

<p>MacRory, Hodges, McGill and other MS sufferers, who claim
considerable benefit from cannabis, are increasingly disaffected
with the charity representing their interests, the Multiple
Sclerosis Society. Hodges points to the memorandum on cannabis
use issued by the Society in which John Walford, its general
secretary, asserts that &quot;there is no evidence that this
agent has an effect on people with MS.&quot; Walford also claimed
that &quot;long-term use may be associated with significant,
serious side effects.&quot; This contradicts Therapeutic Claims
in MS, published by the International Federation of MS Societies,
which concludes that &quot;no significant side effects were
reported in the limited trials&quot; and &quot;no serious
long-term effects have been proven to result from the drug.&quot;

<h3>Hemp FACT #27-U.K. Artcl.Pt 3 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-08 10:57:04 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is part Three of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK. All
comments in ( ) are the posters. </p>

<p>When pressed, Walford concedes, &quot;The society would
welcome properly conducted trials into any substance that is
thought to be helpful, but there are 80,000 people with MS in the
UK. What you are alking about is a small minority. There are
people who will swear by all manner of things.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He [Walford] thinks we all just get high,&quot; counters
Elizabeth MacRory with some bitterness. &quot;He says there are
'significant side effects associated with long-term cannabis use'
yet the Society fails to inform the membership of the toxic
effects of drugs with no proven efficacy which neurologists
continue to prescribe.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Cannabis is one of humanity's oldest medicines, with a
remarkable record of both safety and efficacy,&quot; insists Dr
Lester Grinspoon whose unflinching advocacy of cannabis caused a
storm in America and even led to death threats, &quot;I'd like to
see the day when full medical potential of cannabis is
recognized,&quot; he says. &quot;Then it will be seen in the same
light as other so-called wonderdrugs: penicillin, aspirin and
insulin. People will look back and ask how people could have been
so blind. There is no plant with so many therapeutic qualities.
It's one of the safest drugs known to mankind.&quot; </p>

<p>Far from being a potential &quot;wonderdrug&quot;, it has been
claimed that cannabis causes birth defects, hormonal imbalances
resulting in males growing breasts, impaired sperm and egg
production as well as impotence, frigidity, cancer and brain
damage. None of these claims has yet been supported by scientific
evidence. An estimated 10,000 studies worldwide and hundreds
conducted by the US gorvernment between 1966-76 to back its
policy of prohibition, have shown that cannabis, even when smoked
in huge quantities, is relatively benign. The spaced-out
pot-head, permanently brain damaged after countless tokes on a
&quot;Camberwell carrot&quot;, is a figment of what Grinspoon
calls Psycopharmacological McCarthyism&quot;. </p>

<p>As all regular users know - and the Home Office estimated that
there were 1.5 million in the UK in 1991, and new figures to be
published later this month are likely to put the total higher -
cannabis does have well-known side-effects: attention and
short-term memory, tracking and co-ordination can be impaired.
But not permanently. </p>

<p>The only well-confirmed negative effect of marijuana,
according to Grinspoon, is caused by the smoke, which contains
three times more tars and five times more carbon monoxide than
tobacco. But even the heaviest marijuana smokers rarely use as
much as an average tobacco smoker. And, of course, many prefer to
eat it. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #28-U.K. Artcl.Pt.4 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-09 11:11:10 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Pt. IV of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the posters. </p>

<p>&quot;Cannabis does have therapeutic properties,&quot; admits
Dr Heather Ashton, Professor of Clinical Psychopharmacology at
Newcastle University, &quot;but at the cost, in my view, of
unacceptable side-effects. I'm not convinced that it can be any
more therapeutic than other drugs which don't have the risks or
that the advantages of cannabis outweigh its disadvantages
compared to other drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>Also a leading expert on cannabis, Professor Ashton points to
the &quot;marked increase in heart rate&quot; caused by
marijuana, which, she insists, &quot;can precipitate heart
attacks in people with cardiac diseases.&quot; She stresses that
marijuana does cause &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; when
consumed - &quot;it take away the desire to do anything because
you feel good.&quot; It has, in some rare cases, also triggered
psychotic episodes. </p>

<p>Dr Roger Pertwee, Secretary of the International Cannabis
Research Society and the UK's pre-eminent cannabis expert, sees
himself as occupying the middle ground on the cannabis debate.
&quot;Cannabis does seem to be as effective, if not better, than
existing drugs in dealing with spasticity and bladder problems of
multiple sclerosis. The side-effects seem to be more tolerable
for some patients,&quot; he says. &quot;Clinical trials have all
backed cannabis in being able to, not cure, but suppress some of
the symptons. Migraine could well be another case.&quot; </p>

<p>As a recreational drug, alongside nicotine, alcohol and even
caffeine, Dr Pertwee concedes that cannabis compares favourably.
No human fatalities have as yet been recorded as a result of
marijuana. Withdrawal symptons have been reported in long-term
chronic users in Jamaica and Costa Rica, but they do not appear
to be dependent in the damaging sense that others are to, say,
alcohol and tranquillizers. </p>

<p>Much effort has also been devoted to proving the
&quot;stepping-stone hypothesis&quot; that marijuana smoking
leads to the use of dangerous drugs. In Holland, laws passed in
1976 established a division between hard and soft drugs,
effectively decriminalizing, with strict conditions, the
possesion and supply of cannabis. The Lancet report in 1989:
&quot;The Dutch have shown that there is nothing inevitable about
the drugs ladder in which soft drugs lead to hard drugs. The
ladder does not exist in Holland because the dealers have been
separated.&quot; </p>

<p>The most exhaustive recent investigation into cannabis occured
in America between 1986 and 1988, when the Drug Enforcement
Administration heard evidence from doctors, patients and studied
thousands of pages of documentation. The conclusion reached by
the DEA's administrative judge, Francis J Young, makes startling
reading: &quot;Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially
lethal effects,&quot; declared Young, &quot;But marijuana is not
such a substance . . . Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of
the safest active substances know to man. By any measure of
rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a
supervised routine of medical care.&quot; </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #29-U.K. Artcl.Pt.5 </h3>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Part 5 of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the posters. </p>

<p>Given cannabis's medical potential, why was it criminalised at
all? Jack Here, author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes, has
constructed a powerful thesis to explain cannabis's fall from
favour earlier this century, culminating in the 1937 Marijuana
Tax in America. Cannabis, also known as hemp, is a prolificm
fast-growing crop, useful for a wide range of industrial
purposes, and an economical source of fuel: it threatened to
bankrupt the paper industry, destroy an emerging synthetic fibre
industry and even challenge the dominance of oil companies. </p>

<p>In Harry Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,
imperilled interests in America found a messianic ally, &quot;If
the hideous monster Frankenstein came face to face with the
monster marijuana he would drop dead of fright,&quot; railed
Anslinger. Through a rash of B movies such as Reefer Madness,
Anslinger managed to convince the American public that cannabis
caused violent crimes and accelerated Uncle Sam's moral decline.
Cannabis still unnerves a powerful axis of interests. Many of the
4,000-odd &quot;Families Against Marijuana&quot;-style
organisations in the US are funded by the tobacco, pharmaceutical
and alcohol lobbies. Cannabis revisionists now view the Marijuana
Tax as an ecologocial crime. &quot;We want the establishment to
acknowledge that the reasons cannabis became illegal in the first
place was because of the threat posed by it's commercial
applications. not its use as a drug,&quot; says Andy Waller of
the UK-based House of Hemp, set up this year to promote
cannabis's commercial use. Until the late 19th century, says
Waller, cannabis was one of the world's main agricultural crops. </p>

<p>Today, it has an estimated 50,000 non-smoking commercial uses.
According to the US Department of Agriculture research, hemp has
four times as much cellulose fibre suitable for making paper as
wood pulp. The original Levi's jeans were, in fact, 100 per cent
hemp (This has been debated) / others claim that cultivating
marijuana in the Third World would save the rainforest purify the
atmosphere and provide autonomy to Third World economies crippled
by debt. </p>

<p>In tacit recognition of marijuana's profit potential, in
February, the Home Office granted commercial licences to permit
the cultivation of 1,505 acres of cannabis in the UK. It is,
however, unsmokeable, containing none of the psychoactive
ingredient THC. The first crop is now being harvested. (Most of
the hemp plants that were grown in the U.S. for hundreds of years
prior to prohibition were this type. They grow 18-20 feet tall
and have stalks like tree trunks. This is where the fiber comes
from.) </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Part 6 of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the poster's. </p>

<p>In the Seventies, Dr Raphael Mechoulam, who first isolated THC
at the University of Tel Aviv in 1964, predicted that marijuana
would become a major medicine by the mid-Eighties, replacing 10
to 20 per cent of all prescription medicines. Dr Grinspoon argues
that, since cannabis is inexpensive, it could significantly
reduce health service's enormous drugs bills. </p>

<p>Used to combat stress, the world's number one killer, cannabis
could also curtail or replace hugely-profitable drugs such as
Valium, Librium and, indeed, alcohol, Grinspoon believes.
&quot;I'm convinced,&quot; he says, &quot; that cannibidiol (one
of 60 therapeutic compounds isolated in cannabis) will be the
best sleeping medicine and one of the best anti-anxiety drugs
with the least toxic side-effects.&quot; </p>

<p>Cannabidiol, which does not produce a high, could also
possibly alleviate Britains's most serious drug problem:
tranquiliser abuse, which is already responsible for more
emergency hospital admissions than all illegal drugs combined.
&quot;Cannabidiol could do all these things,&quot; concurs
Professor Ashton. &quot;But not at any less cost than other
drugs, in my opinion.&quot; </p>

<p>At grass-roots level, cannabis's rehabilitation also reflects
a growing disaffection with orthodox medicine, borne out by the
Nineties' boom in alternative medicine. A common complaint, aired
by MS sufferers in particular, is that cannibidiol research has
been woefully neglected. </p>

<p>However, despite decades of marginalisation, there have been
spectacular breakthroughs. Pertwee points to the recent discovery
of anandamide (reported in a recent New Scientist), a substance
produced by the brain that behaves like marijuana.
&quot;Anandamide's discovery promises to open a door to how the
brain works. There may be possibilities of working on a memory
drug and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.&quot; </p>

<p>The exploitation of cannabis's medical benefits has always
been limited because of it's psychoactive properties. The holy
grail of cannabinoid therapeutics has, therefore, been to
eliminate cannabis's high. Drug companies have spent years
trying, without success. But now, the discovery in Cambridge by
Dr Sean Munro of a receptor for THC, not in the brain, but in
peripheral tissues, promise to solve this problem. Pharmaceutical
companies have already expressed an interest in Munro's findings,
particularly as related to glaucoma. Yet it is the receptors in
the brain, points out Munro, &quot;that are responsible for many
of cannabis's potential therapeutic effects.&quot; And it is
precisely the euphoria induced by marijuana which makes it such
an attractive drug for those with terminal illnesses. </p>

<p>Date: 95-02-12 12:30:25 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Part VII of an article that appeared in the Guardian
Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the poster's. </p>

<p>According to Andy Waller, marijuana should
&quot;theoretically&quot; cost less per acre than wheat to grow.
Yet Nabilone, the only synthetic cannabinoid legally prescribed
in the UK, costs the NHS [National Health Service] 39.70 [pounds
about 60-70 dollars?] for twenty capsules. &quot;The
pharmaceutical industry and regulatory system are addicted to the
cult of synthesis,&quot; complains Robert Randall. &quot;It's as
if every drug has to come out of a factory. God forbid that it
might be natural. There's an attitude that man can make a better
Garden Of Eden scientifically.&quot; </p>

<p>In fact, Dr Grinspoon doubts whether synthetic compounds would
be as effective as the natural substance. &quot;It's the synergy
of so many cannabinoids in natural marijuana which may be the
secret to it's wide-ranging properties,&quot; says Grinspoon.
However, he doubts whether straightforward cannabis will become a
prescription drug. As a plant, cannabis cannot be patented and is
therefore an uncommercial proposition for the drug companies. </p>

<p>Legalized prescription would also need to cope with the
problems of standardization and leakage on to the market.
&quot;There would be queues outside every GP's office,&quot;
jokes Mike Goodman of Release, the national drugs and legal
advice service. &quot;If you can get marijuana for $10 an ounce
from your doctor rather than $600 (poster's note--$600 AN
OZ.--Must be some incredible stuff ;-)) on the street,&quot; says
Grinspoon, &quot;it's obvious why prescription won't work.
Cannabis must be given the same status as alcohol - legal, with
appropriate limitations, for use by adults for any purpose.&quot;
</p>

<p>Robert Randall echoes others in vehemently disagreeing with
Grinspoon's call for general legalization. &quot;The idea that
sick people are the key to decriminalization is to hold the
welfare of the ill hostage to reformist fantasies. We want it on
prescription, like morphine, to help people. Not so that a hippie
can have a good time in the afternoon.&quot; </p>

<p>Once deemed the weed that propgated flowerpower, the
subversive dropout's favoured intoxicant, marijuana has since
moved mainstream. It is no longer the narcotic of youthful
rebellion for baby-boomers of non-inhaler Bill Clinton's
generation. Mike Goodman insists more people now roll joints and
eat hash brownies than attend football [soccer] matches, art
galleries or church. A survey to be published by two Manchester
criminologists next month suggests that close to 50 per cent of
teenagers aged 14-16 in urban areas use illicit drugs regularly
[does this include alcohol underage?], most commonly cannabis.
According to Peter McDermott, editor of the International Journal
On Drug Policy: &quot;Cannabis can no longer be regarded as
deviant activity. It's part of our national social life.&quot; </p>

<p>In a recent survey at a leading teaching hospital, the results
of which one source admits to being asked to suppress, &quot;over
60 per cent of medical students were found to be marijuana
users.&quot; In the same survey, only 30 per cent admitted to
smoking cigarettes. </p>

<p>Even senior police officers, such as Commander John Grieve of
the Metropolitan Police, have proposed licensing a network of
drug suppliers and dealers. Brian Hilliard, editor of Police
Review, has called for the legalization of cannabis for several
years. &quot;Legalizing cannabis wouldn't do any harm to
anybody,&quot; he says &quot;We should be concentrating on the
serious business of heroin and amphetamines.&quot; </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #31-U.K. Artcl.Pt.8 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-13 11:02:01 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is the final part of an article that appeared in the
Guardian Newspaper on 9/18/93. </p>

<p>Please remember that this article was written in the UK all
comments in ( ) are the poster's. </p>

<p>The conviction of 42,209 people in 1991 on marijuana charges
contributes to the clogging of the courts and the overcrowding of
prisons. Almost 90 per cent of drug offences involve cannabis.
Yet the British government spends 500 million pounds (750,000,000
dollars approx?) a year on &quot;overall responses to drugs
(international and national)&quot; and receives no tax revenue
from the UK's estimated 1.8 billion pound (2.7 billion dollars?)
illicit drugs market. </p>

<p>Increasingly, those pressing for marijuana's legalization
mirror Grinspoon's belief that, &quot;since scientific scepticism
of marijuana has all but collapsed&quot;, the chief opposition to
cannabis rests on a moral and political, not toxicological,
foundation. </p>

<p>The real damage that cannabis causes, the argument goes, is to
the body politic. In his recent book, Food Of The Gods, Terence
McKenna neatly encapsulates dope's lasting social potentcy:
&quot;It (cannabis) dimishes the power of ego, has a mitigating
effect on competition. causes one to question authority, and
reinforces the notion of merely relative importance of social
values.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's clear that the government's war on drugs takes
precedence over medical rationality,&quot; says Nick Partridge of
the Terrence Higgins Trust (A national UK charity dealing with
AIDS (I think)). &quot;At present we're criminalizing many people
in massive pain at the end of their lives. Yet I don't expect the
medical arguments to break through the political dogma
surrounding marijuana and that is deeply regrettable.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Marijuana has empowered many sick people for the first
time,&quot; says Robert Randall. &quot;For many, it is the only
drug that works. The real problem with marijuana is perhaps it
threatens to put people in charge of their own medical lives. The
question is: who is going to control individual's biology - large
corporations, doctors and governments, or people
themselves?&quot; </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #32-Buckley.Pt.1 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-14 11:01:23 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This column by William F. Buckley was in The Albuquereque
Journal June 9, 1993. It makes a good argument for marijuana
legalization. William Buckley's columns are copyright by the
Universal Press </p>

<p>Syndicate. </p>

<p><b>Legalization of Marijuana Long Overdue</b> </p>

<p>In a recent encounter, Edward Koch reminded his interlocuter
that many years ago, Rep. Edward Koch had sought backing for a
congressional investigation into the marijuana laws. I had been
reminded by the former mayor of New York that along about
1967-68, the typical congressman had to reflect that any law
requiring one or five or 10 years in jail as a penalty for being
caught using marijuana endangered his own sons and daughters in
college. Koch got the support he sought. </p>

<p>But no meaningful reforms, if that is the word we are
permitted to use, were enacted. In 1967, all drug arrests came to
121,000. Of these, marijuana arrests were one-half, 61,000. In
1991, all drug arrests were 1 million, marijuana 285,000. </p>

<p>Background data give us perspective. Sixty-six million
Americans have smoked marijuana, and at least 10 million -
perhaps many more - continue to do so regularly. Comparable
figures? Twenty-two million have used cocaine, 1.5 million still
do; 150 million have used tobacco, 50 million still do. In 1976,
12 percent of children age 12-17 had used marijuana during the
preceding month. By 1990, this figure was down to 5 percent. Over
age 26, the percentage had not changed: 3.5 percent in 1976, 3.6
percent in 1990. </p>

<p>The social vectors within the drug-law-reform movement have
during the period since Koch asked for an investigation of
federal marijuana laws moved as follows: </p>

<p>-The informed public is gradually willing to acknowledge a
difference between marijuana and more lethal drugs. </p>

<p>-It is, however reluctantly, acknowledged that marijuana can
have therapeutic uses, in particular to bring relief to those
suffering from radiation or chemotherapy treatments for cancer. </p>

<p>-There is a gradual awakening of the moral sensibilities of
the alert members of the public. My own belated arrival on the
scene stings in the memory. It came with a letter from a father
in his early 30s who neither smoked nor drank, who had three
children, was gainfully employed, and engaged in civic-minded
activity - but liked on Saturday nights, to retreat to his
woodshed and smoke a joint. He was caught at it, arrested, his
house seized, and is now in jail, and sentenced to 10 years. It
is hard to understand the moral disposition of the prosecuter who
asked for that sentence, and the judge who imposed it. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #33-Buckley.Pt.2 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-15 12:18:36 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is Part 2 of a column by William F. Buckley in The
Albuquereque Journal June 9, 1993. It makes a good argument for
marijuana legalization. </p>

<p>William Buckley's columns are copyright by the Universal Press
Syndicate. </p>

<p><b>Legalization of Marijuana Long Overdue</b> </p>

<p>The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has
a program, which is to bring on the legalization of marijuana by
the year 1997. The president of NORML, as it is everywhere
referred to, is a man of considerable literary and polemical
skills. Richard Cowan is a graduate of Yale and a co-founder of
Young Americans for Freedom. He is here and there given to
hyperbole, as when he cites the support given to the Partnership
for a Drug Free America (PDFA) by corporate America as
&quot;reminiscent of the support given the Nazis by German
industrialists.&quot; </p>

<p>But Cowen is on to something, the root credentials of which
are: </p>

<p>-However one feels about legalizing cocaine, the case for
legalizing marijuana is an entire world removed from that
question. </p>

<p>-The amount of money and of legal energy being given to
prosecute hundreds of thousands of Americans who are caught with
a few ounces of marijuana in their jeans simply makes no sense -
the kindest way to put it. A sterner way to put it is that it is
an outrage, an imposition on basic civil liberties and on the
reasonable expenditure of social energy. </p>

<p>-The point must surely come when the American people
acknowledge that the drive against marijuana is not proving
anything at all, given the continuing availability of the drug
and its (relatively modest) patronage. </p>

<p>Richard Cowan makes a telling point, namely that the media are
notoriously insensitive to the abuses of the narcocracy.
&quot;Most people are unaware of the nature of the marijuana
prohibition in America today, the extent of its cruelty and
injustice, and the threat that it poses to everyone's freedom.
Ironically, many of those who are aware of the extent of the
problem view it as being so great that they despair of being able
to end it. Consequently, as an act of triage, they abandon it as
a lost cause, to work on something which they view as at least
possible.&quot; Like what? The rehabilitation of President
Clinton? </p>

<p>More stuff manana -- Keep those cards and letters coming ;-) </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #34-PFDFA </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-16 11:39:03 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>This is Part 1 of an article that appeared in The Hartford
Courant. It shows the lies perpetrated by the Partnership for a
Drug Free America.</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Untruths, unreliable data create obstacles in war on
drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>It is a stark message designed to persuade youths to stay away
from marijuana. </p>

<p>And it is a lie. </p>

<p>The narrator tells television viewers they are watching the
brain waves of a normal 14-year-old. As he speaks, squiggly lines
with high peaks show an obviously active brain. </p>

<p>The picture changes: The lines flatten. These, the narrator
says, are the brain waves of a 14-year-old on marijuana. </p>

<p>The problem with this national television advertisement is
that the flatter &quot;brain waves&quot; are not those of a
teenager on dope; they are not brain waves at all. The
electroencephalograph was not hooked up to anyone. </p>

<p>It is not just brain waves that are being manipulated in the
war against drugs. Truth has been a casualty in other areas as
well. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>A study cited by presidents and business leaders to
demonstrate the effect of drug use on worker productivity has no
scientific validity according to the organization that conducted
it. </p>

<p>No one has been able to produce another widely quoted study
that purportedly showed drug users cost companies more in
worker's compensation claims and medical benefits. </p>

<p>A third study, used to show that marijuana could cause
long-term impairment, was improperly conducted and reached
conclusions no other study has been able to duplicated, according
to one of its authors. </p>

<p>[article goes on to say that drugs are bad but that lying
about it destroys the credibility of the anti-drug crusade.] </p>

<p>&quot;Part of the problem we have as drug educators today is
that kids don't believe us,&quot; said Dr. Lester Grinspoon, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School
who has researched the effects of marijuana. </p>

<p>&quot;They've been told for so long that marijuana is very bad
for them and then they go off to college and see a brilliant
English major that smokes dope and nothing's happened to his or
her brain or heart. Then they use it themselves and discover it's
the least harmful illegal drug. So they say that maybe they've
been lied to about cocaine or PCP, too.&quot; </p>

<p>But such questions are not the foremost concern of the
organization that created the brain-wave advertisement. The
Partnership for a Drug-Free America wants, above all else, to
prevent people from using drugs. </p>

<p>Theresa Grant, public information director for the nonprofit
organization, said she doesn't see any problem with the ad.
&quot;The marijuana brain-wave commercial was one of the ads that
we used as a fact, rather than a fear-inducing ad,&quot; Grant
said. later, she acknowledged: &quot;It was a simulation. They
manipulated the machine. It was not attached to any person. It
was not scientific. At the time we created it in 1987, we were
told that it was an appropriate representation,&quot; by the
government's National Institute on Drug Abuse. </p>

<p>... She emphasized that the partnership has not conceded that
the brain-wave representation was inaccurate ... </p>

<p>&quot;It's a flat lie,&quot; said Grinspoon. &quot;Marijuana
has no clinically significant effect on the
electroencephalograph.&quot; ... </p>

<p>Citing a Harvard Medical School study, he said, &quot;Nobody
has been able to demonstrate one iota of brain damage from
smoking marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p>Part 2. Tomorrow </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #35-PFDFA </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-17 11:18:52 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>This is part 2 of an article that appeared in The Hartford
Courant in 90 or 91</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Untruths, unreliable data create obstacles in war on
drugs.&quot; It is a stark message designed to persuade youths to
stay away from marijuana. </p>

<p>And it is a lie. </p>

<p>Social 'Studies' </p>

<p>Last year President Bush declared that &quot;drug abuse among
American workers costs businesses anywhere from $60 billion to
$100 billion a year in lost productivity, absenteeism,
drug-related accidents, medical claims and theft.&quot; </p>

<p>Where did he get those number? </p>

<p>Bush, and President Reagan before him, have based their
comments about drugs and productivity on a study conducted by the
Research Triangle Institute, a nonprofit research organization
near Raleigh, N.C., according to Henrick J. Harwood, who led the
study and now is senior policy analyst in the White House drug
policy office. ... </p>

<p>&quot;It was an inexpensive study done with inadequate
data,&quot; said Reid Maness, senior manager of communications
for Research Triangle Institute. &quot;Unfortunately, there
hasn't been attempt since then to do anything better. This still
remains the most recent and best study of its type. </p>

<p>&quot;When we see people being critical about it, we don't get
too upset. RTI would agree that the study does not have a lot of
precision. We never claimed that it did,&quot; Maness said. </p>

<p>The study concluded: </p>

<p>o People who had *ever* been heavy marijuana users cost the
nation $34.2 billion in diminished worker productivity in 1980. </p>

<p>o Adding the costs of drug-related health problems, crime and
accidents --figures that exist only in very rough estimates --
the study concluded that all drug abuse, excluding alcohol, cost
the country $47 billion in 1980. </p>

<p>How did the institute come up with its figures? </p>

<p>Using statistics from a 1982 household survey by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, the institute compared the average
income for households in which one person admitted to having
every used marijuana daily to the average for households in which
no one admitted to having ever used marijuana daily. </p>

<p>Households with former heavy smokers of marijuana had an
average income 27.9 percent lower than similar households in
which marijuana had not been used heavily, the institute said. </p>

<p>The study concluded that, when the figures were extrapolated
to the general population, marijuana abuse caused an estimated
loss in income of $34.2 billion in 1980. In turn, the researchers
equated the reduced income with reduced productivity. ... </p>

<p>&quot;The study is worthless,&quot; said Dr. John P. Morgan,
medical professor and head of the pharmacology department at the
City University of New York Medical School. &quot;It is obviously
absurd. It has to do with the fact that NIDA is functioning
chiefly as a minister of propaganda in the war on drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>The study did not prove any relationship between marijuana use
and reduced household income. Despite its conclusion that
&quot;The [productivity] loss due to marijuana abuse was
estimated at $34.2 billion for 1980,&quot; the study elsewhere
notes that the reduced income was not necessarily a result of
marijuana use. </p>

<p>Even if it were, income does not equal productivity. </p>

<p>In an article in the University of Kansas Law Review, Morgan
write that if income were the same as productivity, then &quot;a
judge is less productive than a practicing lawyer, a medical
school professor is less productive than a practicing physician,
a farmer is less productive than a florist and an elementary
school teacher is less productive than an owner of a daycare
center.&quot; </p>

<p>The study arrived at one particularly curious conclusion: </p>

<p>People who were *currently* abusing any illegal drug cost the
nation nothing in diminished worker productivity. </p>

<p>A 34-year-old who told researchers in 1982 that he had smoked
marijuana every day during the summer of 1966 and had not touched
an illegal drug since would be classified as a worker whose
productivity was significantly diminished by drug use. </p>

<p>Part 3. Tomorrow - The Study that Wasn't </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #36-PFDFA </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-18 11:46:22 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>This is Part 3 of an article from The Hartford Courant</b> </p>

<p><b>&quot;Untruths, unreliable data create obstacles in war on
drugs.&quot;</b> </p>

<p><b>The study that wasn't.</b> </p>

<p>Shocking anti-drug statistics seem always to make headlines,
regardless of what they are based upon. </p>

<p>In 1983, Dr. Sidney Cohen, a clinical professor of psychiatry
at UCLA, wrote in the Drug Abuse and Alcoholism Newsletter that
drug users were five times as likely to file workers'
compensation claims and that they received three times the
average level of benefits for illness. </p>

<p>His source was a study purportedly done by the Firestone Tire
and Rubber Co. Many other drug fighters, particularly people in
favor of widespread drug testing of employees, have quoted either
the Firestone study or the newsletter edited by Cohen, who has
since died. </p>

<p>In fact, there appears to have been no such study. </p>

<p>&quot;About three people have asked me for that study,&quot;
said the Firestone medical director, Dr. E. Gates Morgan.
&quot;I'm unaware of it. We had an [employee assistance program]
man with us, but left the company in 1983 and died in 1987. I've
looked all over for the stuff he wrote, but we don't have any
copies of it at all.&quot; ... </p>

<p>A life of their own </p>

<p>Other widely quoted studies have even larger margins of error
-- but you wouldn't know that by listening to the people who
quote them. &quot;Marijuana does not wear off in a couple of
hours,&quot; said Rosanna Creighton, president of the nonpartisan
lobbying group &quot;Citizens for a Drug-free Oregon.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The pleasure high is gone, but the effect it has ... on
motor skills, eye-to-hand coordination, peripheral vision ... is
not gone. A Stanford University study showed that 24 hours after
smoking marijuana, the ability of airplane pilots was
impaired.&quot; </p>

<p>Creighton was referring to a 1985 study paid for by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Veterans Administration
Medical Research Service. It has been used to show that even
casual marijuana use is dangerous -- despite many government
studies that have concluded the opposite. ... </p>

<p>The study said that although the pilots were unaware they were
impaired, their marijuana-induced errors could easily lead to
airplane crashes. </p>

<p>But a co-author of the study is not confident of those
findings. </p>

<p>&quot;The results of the study were suggestive, non
conclusive,&quot; said Dr. Von Otto Leirer, an experimental
psychologist. &quot;We didn't have the appropriate controls for
the experiment. That was a real serious problem.&quot; </p>

<p>Leirer said a follow-up study, using the proper controls and
methods, was conducted. That study was published in December, but
attracted little notice. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>In the past 20 years, studies have shown marijuana to cause
brain damage, paranoia, early senility, heart malfunction and
sexual problems, Grinspoon said. In every case, he said,
follow-up studies failed to confirm that marijuana caused any of
those problems. </p>

<p><b>The Dark Side of DARE</b> </p>

<p><b>by Pastor Jaymes Douglass Fyr</b> </p>

<p>Police officers visiting schools - anti-drug programs -
neither one is new. I remember being told as a child &quot;the
policeman is your friend.&quot; I still have the worn old book
preaching against drugs and alcohol from high school. These
things have been ar ound for decades. </p>

<p>Now they have come together. Former Los Angeles police chief
Daryl Gates created the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program
in 1983 as a joint effort of the police department and the L.A.
school district to fight drug use in the city's schools. It has
since spread nationwide and abroad, as far away as Australia and
New Zealand. Millions have been exposed to it. </p>

<p>So what is DARE? In most forms it consists of 17 one hour
sessions, held weekly and covering subjects ranging from refusal
skills to alternatives to drug use. It is taught by uniformed
police officers and usually begins with fifth graders. Funding
comes from both governmental and private sources. </p>

<p>Nothing is wrong with teaching anybody of any age to assert
themselves and think for themselves. Teens often have a hard time
saying &quot;no.&quot; Breaking the back of peer pressure is hard
to do. And this can also help reject pressure to engage in
unwanted sex and other temptations. </p>

<p>What makes DARE different is having police officers teach the
classes. That's kind of like having teachers arrest muggers.
That's not their job - it's not what they have been trained to
do. Why not have public health officials lecture about the harmfu
l aspects of drugs? To be balanced, why not invite NORML members
or Native American shamans to tell how drugs can be used in
beneficial ways? Is the information presented truthful? For
example, the discredited research of Dr. Gabriel Nahas is still
touted about the supposed evils of marijuana use. Are alcohol,
tobacco, caffeine and prescription drugs covered, or only
&quot;illegal&quot; drugs? Is this an effort to promote awareness
of health and safety, or just another attempt to enforce blind
obedience to the law? </p>

<p>And finally, is DARE really out to fight the &quot;drug
problem&quot; by encouraging children to inform on people they
know who use illegal drugs? </p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, in a front page article on April 20,
1992, reported the case of Crystal Grendell, a fifth grader who
was asked if she knew anyone who used drugs. Crystal was taking
DARE classes taught by Searsport, Maine, police chief James Gil
lway in the spring of 1991. She was worried because her parents
grew and smoked marijuana. She didn't say anything at the time,
but later went to Gillway and reported her parents. Six cops
raided the family home, seized Crystal and 49 one foot high
marijuana plants and arrested the parents. The mother lost her
job and the father got one year's probation. Crystal's straight
A's turned into C's, she now fears the police and frequently has
nightmares. The article also mentions other parents who have been
turned in by their children - at the instigation of DARE.
Parents' anti-DARE groups are beginning to form. A lady from L.A.
told me that her child had broken down under interrogation and
admitted that &quot;mom smokes pot.&quot; This lady received a
stern lecture from local child protective &quot;services.&quot; </p>

<p>But DARE is wildly popular among politicians, school
administrators and cops! Every cop car in town has a DARE bumper
sticker on it. Lots of civilian cars have them too. You see
people everywhere wearing DARE t-shirts. I even recently saw a
black city bus plastered with the DARE logo and slogan, in big
red letters. It's an election year, everybody! Climb onto the
politically correct bandwagon! </p>

<p>Kinda got messed up on those numbers yesterday. It won't

<p><b>A World Gone Mad Part 1</b> </p>

<p><b>By Ronald W. Rose United States Magistrate Judge</b> </p>

<p><b>In Police News Spring 94</b> </p>

<p>Twenty years ago as a young prosecutor, my job was to put
people in jail for dealing in drugs. As a result, many were
convicted. I was absolutely certain that vigorous enforcement and
long jail terms was the way to go. I had every confidence that
throwing resources, manpower, additional judges, mandatory
minimum sentences, life without parole, etc., etc., etc., would
soon solve the problem. </p>

<p>Within a few months, I tried another drug case involving the
largest (at that time cocaine seizure in the history of Florida -
23 pounds. It was front page news for days. These defendants were
likewise convicted and are probably still in prison. Has this
solved anything? In my opinion, absolutely nothing was
accomplished, except I got to chalk up another victory at a cost
to the taxpayers of thousands of dollars each year, for clothing
and feeding these dregs of society. </p>

<p>Instead of seizing pounds of cocaine, we now seize buildings
full of the stuff. The drug lords in South America are laughing
at us all the way to the bank. They know that for every mule or
mid-level dealer we take out, there are fifty more waiting to
take their place. There is just so much money to be made that the
slim chance of being caught is always worth the risk. Believe me,
after twenty years as a prosecutor and judge, I can assure you
that we only catch the stupid ones. </p>

<p>In disadvantaged neighborhoods, drug dealers are the local
heroes. Every kid in the ghetto wants to be one. These children
see it as a way out of their despair and poverty. They can make
more selling &quot;crack&quot; cocaine, in one afternoon, than a
hard working person with a job can make in a week. I customarily
speak with DEA agents who visit my office for search warrants.
Their attitude is universally one of despair. They spend entire
careers believing each day they come to work that their presence
makes a difference, but the problem gets worse no matter what
they do. It is getting worse in logarithmic proportions. We
already have more people in jail, per capita, than any other
country on earth (About five times as many per capita). </p>

<p>We used to ignore the battlefield carnage of the street gangs,
as they were only killing each other in their own neighborhoods.
Now theses same gangs are coming out of their ghettos. They are
increasingly taking their act on the road. One new tactic is to
cruise the freeways at night looking for wealthy individuals who
they can follow home, brutalize, rape and pillage, all for the
sake of supporting a drug habit. </p>

<p>Year after year we are treated to the same tired political
solutions. We now have a &quot;drug czar.&quot; Whoop-de-do! The
first one got his picture taken a few hundred times, gave a few
speeches, declared victory and resigned. We have spent decades
throwing more judges into the system, adding prosecutors,
investigators, building prisons (but not in my backyard), using
the military, and in short spending an incredible bundle of
money. </p>

<p>We have nothing to show for it but a bunch of photo
opportunities where a few pounds of the stuff and some seized
cash are exhibited in grand style to demonstrate how well law
enforcement does its job. The carrot is always held out that we
are turning the corner; there is a light at the end of this
tunnel. Sure. </p>

<p>By and large law enforcement is composed of men and women
truly dedicated to their profession - individuals who would lay
their lives on the line and often do. They have an unenviable
job. Yet their function has been reduced to stamping out
cockroaches without any ability to get to the nest. A total waste
of time and energy. The drug lords love it. </p>

<p>My solution is not politically correct and is certainly not
acceptable to those upstanding politicians (oxymoron, sorry) we
have entrusted to make our decisions for us. It is, simply, to
decriminalize the use and possession of drugs. Not only
decriminalize them, hut actually give them away to anyone insane
enough to want them. </p>

<p>Before anyone goes ballistic here, I do not advocate giving
drugs to children. This should always be a capital offense. We
have to take the profit motive out of this Dante's Inferno that
is killing us like the Chinese &quot;death from a thousand
cuts.&quot; Prohibition did not work with alcohol and it is not
working with drugs. I harbor no illusions that this solution is
perfect, but it is essentially the only one remaining. </p>

<p>The Colombian cartels, the Jamaican gangs, the Ins Angeles
street gangs, and our local drug lords make the Mafia look like a
troop of girl scouts. The terror is coming to our shores, a
little bit at a time, and we just sit back and take it. Why can't
we realize what is happening to us before it is too late? </p>

<p>If we used the money presently being squandered to lose the
drug war, funnel it into drug treatment and education, the
problem would largely disappear in a few years. There would be no
profit left. Drugs would be free, drug lords would lose their
millions and millions in profits, corruption would all but
disappear (except maybe in the Savings and Loan industry), our
elderly would not feel trapped in their homes, and most
importantly, our children would have a future free from the
specter of slaughter in their schools or having to endure the
nightmare of addiction. The present generation of drug user is
probably beyond hope. Perhaps treatment will help, but we have to
cut our loses and protect what is left. </p>

<p><b>Our Drug Laws Have Failed </b></p>

<p><b>By James P. Gray, U.S. Superior Court Judge</b> </p>

<p><b>In Police News, Spring 94</b> </p>

<p>What we are doing is not working We have focused our
attention, effort and resources upon intercepting heroin, cocaine
and marijuana, and incarcerating those who sell and use them. We
have been increasingly successful in seizing even larger
quantities of these drugs, con`vichog greater numbers of
defendants who are involved with them and sentencing those
defendants to even longer terms in our jails and prisons. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, the magnitude of the problem created by making
these drugs illegal continues to grow. The only practical
resolution available to us is to revise our laws so that the use
by adults of heroin, cocaine and marijuana, and the purchase by
adults of these drugs generically at licensed commercial
pharmacies is legal. </p>

<p>Although under this proposal the purchase and use by adults of
heroin, cocaine and marijuana from the pharmacies would be legal,
the sale, transfer or furnishing hy anyone of any quantity of
these drugs to minors would he severely punished. Also, present
laws concerning public drunkenness, driving a motor vehicle while
under the influence, etc., would not he changed, and the
unlicensed sale of these drugs would remain a violation of the
law. The price of the drugs at the pharmacies would be set at an
amount that would be continually adjusted so as to undercut the
sales price of any illegal sale &quot;on the street.&quot; This
would do away with the financial incentive to sell them
illegally. </p>

<p>Without a doubt, some people will continue to buy and abuse
these drugs under this proposal. However, since there would be no
incentive to &quot;push&quot; these drugs, they would never be
advertised or &quot;on sale&quot;, and free samples would never
be given to anyone, including non-users in order to get them
&quot;hooked&quot;, etc., the usage should not be above the
present rate, and probably, after a possible initial surge, would
be materially reduced. </p>

<p>All of the other results under this plan would be positive.
Crime would he materially reduced. For example, there is no
violence now in the manufacture, distribution and purchase of
alcohol. Also, for those who would continue to burglarize in
support of their drug habit, they would do so less often because
of the reduced price. Since part of the sales price at the
pharmacies would be a tax, resources for the education about and
treatment of drug abuse would he substantially increased. Police
and society's other pressing needs. No new taxes would be needed
for jail or courthouse construction. Lower income areas would be
reclaimed from the drug sellers. Monies obtained by juvenile
gangs and other organized crime would be decreased. Violence and
corruption in our country and abroad would be significantly
decreased. Overdoses and other medical problems from the usage of
these drttgs would be reduced because the Food and Drug
Administration would ensure that the strengths of these drugs
would be accurately set forth on the labels. Drug treatment would
be encouraged because of warning labels outside, and literature
inside the packages, including toll-free numbers to call for more
information. Clean needles would reduce the spread of AIDS. </p>

<p>Many good, honest and intelligent people may disagree with
this proposal on moral and/or other reasonable grounds. In
addition, other people who have vested interests in the present
system may also oppose this plan. However, in my opinion, the
choice we have now is further to escalate our efforts and the </p>

<p>spending of our limited resources in a losing or lost
&quot;war on drugs,&quot; or to face the reality that is upon us
and legalize these drugs under a plan of regulated distribution
such as this one. The sooner we make the change, the sooner we
can stop the bleeding. </p>

<p>Tomorrow ??????????????? Stay Tuned </p>

<p><b>Quotables from Notables (was &lt;--- that too cute or what)
More stuff from Police News</b> </p>

<p><b>Views from the Front</b> </p>

<p>George Schultz, the former Secretary of State for Reagan, says
legalization would destroy dealers profits and remove their
incentive to get young people addicted. He concedes, however,
that such a proposal is unpopular. </p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance
these views and people head for somebody else,&quot; says
Schultz. &quot;Everybody is scared to talk about it. No
politician wants to say what I just said, not for a minute.&quot;
</p>

<p><b>Patrick Murphy:</b> </p>

<p>We over rely on law enforcement and interdiction. Only about
30% of our spending is on treatment, prevention and education. In
Canada the balance is about the exact opposite. </p>

<p>Politicians get in a bidding war over who can talk the
toughest. It started when I was police commissioner of New York
when Rockefeller was governor. </p>

<p>A lot of people have gone to prison since then and drug abuse
has gotten worse. I think NAVPO's effort to show police officers
another way to look at this issue is a commendable and an
enlightened approach. </p>

<p><b>Jerry V. Willimas, Former Chief of Police, Washington D.C.:</b>
</p>

<p>(Former) Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders' suggestion that we
study the idea of decriminalizing illicit drugs took me back to
the early 1970s, when people were talking seriously about
decriminalizing marijuana. One private conversation from that
time stuck in my mind. &quot;Personally, I don't think that
marijuana is any more dangerous than my favorite psychoactive
drug, the martini,&quot; the statement went. &quot; But I'm
afraid that decriminalization would send a signal to young people
that it is all right to use it.&quot; </p>

<p>The words are not exact, for I did not make notes, but that is
the crux of what President Nixon said to me some two decades ago.
Here we are 20 years later, and I wonder if anyone received the
signal Mr. Nixon was talking about. In 1992, local and state law
enforcement agencies reported nearly a million arrests for drugs
violations. Drug offenders make up one-third of the felony
convictions in the state courts. In a nation where three-quarters
of all robberies go unsolved and where violent offenders go free
on bail awaiting trial dates on overburdened court dockets, we
choose to clog the system with drug offenders. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #43-MoreNetherlands </h3>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Sorry I'm late today. My wife decided the carpet cleaning was
more important and I &quot;had&quot; to agree with her ;-) </p>

<p>In keeping with the Netherlands theme from yesterday, I came
across a column in today's Dallas Morning News Viewpoints section
written by Joanne Jacobs who writes for the San Jose Mercury
News. </p>

<p>Following are excerpts from her column. (Any typos are mine) </p>

<p><b>Holland's Approach to Drugs</b> </p>

<p><b>Joanne Jacobs</b> </p>

<p>...Contrary to what Americans think, drugs aren't legal in the
Netherlands. It is just that drug laws aren't enforced. Marijuana
and hashish are tolerated, unless users or sellers cause
problems, in which case a </p>

<p>coffeehouse may be closed down. Hard drug smugglers and
vendors aren't tolerated. </p>

<p>Occasionally, police sweep a neighborhood where drug use is
out of hand. Otherwise addicts are offered help at rehabilitation
or residential treatment centers. Addiction isn't criminal. </p>

<p>A Baltimore grand jury recently came out for
&quot;medicalizing&quot; rather than criminalizing--or
legalizing--drug abuse. It proposed offering users treatment
instead of time behind bars. The idea is lifted from the </p>

<p>Netherlands and other countries that try to reduce the harm
caused by drug abuse, rather than turning users into criminals. </p>

<p>The grand jury concluded that legalizing drugs would increase
addiction but suggested that doctors might be allowed to
prescribe drugs to addicts. The goal isn't to make everyone clean
and sober--that isn't possible--but, rather, to lower the level
of street dealing and the crime that goes with it. &quot;Removing
the profit from the drug trade may be the only way to
resolve&quot; the problem, the report says. </p>

<p>According to the report, 80 percent of prisoners in Baltimore
jails are in for drug-related crimes. Baltimore Circuit Judge
Joseph P. McCurdy Jr. had told the grand jury to consider
decriminalization, saying:&quot;Many of us feel that the war on
drugs hasn't succeeded (my note: duhhh), that we are losing
ground with each passing day, that we are wasting resources and
that we have to look at the problem anew&quot;. </p>

<p>...The Dutch say that their relaxed approach hasn't boosted
the Dutch addiction rate and that marijuana use by teenagers is
declining. Junkies steal car radios to finance their habits. But
there is little violence. The streets are safe. </p>

<p>The Dutch success with harm reduction policies may not
transplant easily to American society, which is more puritanical
and more violent. But we have to get serious about the trade-offs
in confronting drug abuse. Protecting law-abiding citizens from
street violence should be our top priority. Making it harder for
drug abusers to harm themselves shouldn't take precedence. </p>

<p>Medicalizing drugs wouldn't make the steets as safe as they
are in Amsterdam. But it could help. And it would make room in
prisons for the real criminals. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #44-Interpol </h3>

<p>Date: 95-02-27 12:09:50 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Following is a statement made by Raymond Kendall, secretary
general of the International Criminal Police Organization. Let's
all jump on his bandwagon. </p>

<p><b>Head of Interpol advocates &quot;drug&quot;
decriminalization</b> </p>

<p>On Wednesday, June 8, the head of the international police
agency Interpol stated his support for decriminalizing drugs. </p>

<p>Raymond Kendall, secretary general of the International
Criminal Police Organization, responded to the British Police's
call to decriminalize drugs by saying, &quot;I think we should
accept the reality of the situation... that there are many, many
drug users who are living in a situation of illegality
already.&quot; </p>

<p>Kendall's comment touched on one of the main arguments for
ending Marijuana Prohibition, namely that prohibition is not
preventing or dissuading people from consuming cannabis. </p>

<p>Kendall also acknowledged that most British cannabis consumers
are not even being dealt with by the law, probably because (1)
most consumers go undetected by the law, and (2) many who are
actually caught by the police are not arrested. This comment
touches on two more NORML tenets: (1) It is simply impossible to
arrest and incarcerate every marijuana consumer, and (2)
marijuana's illegality is causing widespread disrespect for the
law and makes police the citizens 'enemies'. </p>

<p>Many Supporters of Marijuana Prohibition repeatedly insist
that marijuana &quot;legalization&quot; will encourage people to
use the drug. The truth is that millions are already consuming
cannabis in complete disregard for the law. </p>

<p><b>Another Interpol Article</b> </p>

<p>Date: 05-Oct-94 20:20 PDT </p>

<p><b>RTw 10/04 Interpol head says drugs a threat to democracy</b>
</p>

<p><b>By Melanie Goodfellow </b></p>

<p>ROME, Oct 4 (Reuter) - The global drug problem is one of the
biggest threats to democracy and the scourge cannot be conquered
by law enforcement alone, one of the world's top police officials
said on Tuesday. </p>

<p>&quot;I believe that the struggle between East and West has
been replaced by the world's struggle against drugs,&quot;
Interpol Secretary-General Raymond Kendall told reporters on the
final day of the organisation's 63rd annual conference. </p>

<p>&quot;But there is an imbalance between the resources put into
the law enforcement side and that put into stemming the demand by
which I mean the drug abuse side,&quot; he added. &quot;Unless we
address this we will not affect the problem.&quot; </p>

<p>Kendall said that the United Nations' drugs commission had
recommended a move away from law enforcement which hit suppliers
towards an emphasis on more powerful health and education
campaigns which would cut the demand for drugs. </p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately there are very few countries which have
adopted these recommendations,&quot; added Kendall, whose
organisation coordinates the work of 176 police forces worldwide.
</p>

<p>Over 500 top international policemen attended the six-day
conference at a police school on the outskirts of Rome. </p>

<p>Money laundering, counterfeiting of currency and luxury goods,
and environmental crime such as the dumping of toxic waste and
trafficking of nuclear products were also high on the agenda,
Kendall said. </p>

<p>Interpol also pledged to work closely with the International
tribunal set up to tackle crimes committed in former Yugoslavia. </p>

<p>Next year's conference is to be held in Beijing in China,
while Turkey and India are vying to host it in 1996. </p>

<p>Interpol, which will have a budget of $28 million next year,
elected Swedish national police commissioner, Bjorn Eriksson, as
the organisation's new chairman. </p>

<p>&quot;It's a great honour for me. There are few trade names so
well known as the concept of Interpol. Every little girl and boy
in Sweden knows about Interpol because it's in all the detective
stories,&quot; the 48-year-old Eriksson. </p>

<p>In his speech, Eriksson called for greater cooperation among
the world's police forces and the need for public support. </p>

<p>&quot;It is vital that criminals should be unable to find
refuge in any part of the world,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Poster's note: Drug addiction is a disease. There is nothing
criminal about the use of drugs. I can't help it if
&quot;uninformed&quot; people are in charge of making laws and
the lawmakers that are &quot;informed&quot; are too
&quot;chicken&quot; (haven't used that expression in a long time,
but it seemed to fit) to do anything about it. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #46-Cancer </h3>

<p>Date: 95-03-01 12:19:13 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Back to the medical stuff again. If you have cancer or know
someone that does, please read the following article. </p>

<p><b>A quote from the July 6-12, 1991 issue of the Economist</b>
</p>

<p>Drugs can be medicinal or recreational: marijuana is both. For
nearly 20 years advocates of its medicinal use- to relieve the
nausea of chemotherapy, to treat glaucoma and to help AIDS
patients gain weighthave fought in the American courts to have
the drug reclassified so that doctors can prescribe it. Currently
marijuana is grouped with the most disapproved of drugs, such as
LSD and heroin. The government argues it must remain so because
it has no &quot;currently accepted medical use in
treatment&quot;. A new study by researchers at Harvard refutes
this. </p>

<p>Mainly because of its effectiveness in treating the vomiting
common among cancer patients during chemotherapy,
tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in
marijuana, was approved for medical use in America in 1985. A
synthetic form of THC is sold in pill form under the trade name
Marinol; last year almost 100,000 doses were prescribed. Smokable
marijuana, however, is available to just 34 people through a
&quot;compassionate use&quot; programme. To the confusion of many
a police officer, these patients are given a supply of marijuana
cigarettes rolled by government hands at a research farm in
Mississippi. </p>

<p>Proponents claim that smoking marijuana works better than
taking oral THC. In 1988 Francis Young, a judge who examines
administrative issues for the Drug Enforcement Agency,
recommended that marijuana be reclassified on the ground that
&quot;current acceptance&quot; of a drug is present if a
&quot;respectable minority&quot; of doctors endorse it. The
administration disagreed, claiming that the vast majority of
doctors believe oral THC is as reliable and effective as smokable
marijuana and produces fewer side-effects. </p>

<p>Enter Rick Doblin and Mark Kleiman, two drug-policy
researchers at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. To test
the administrations thesis, they conducted a random survey of
members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Some 1,035
responded, about 10% of America's oncologists. The results,
published in the July 1st issue of the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, surprised even Mr. Doblin and Mr. Kleiman; nearly half
of the respondents said they would prescribe smokable marijuana
if it were legal. Indeed 44% of them said they had, in effect,
done so already by recommending it to one or more of their
patients, despite the possibility of prosecution. </p>

<p>Nearly two-thirds of the oncologists agreed that marijuana was
an effective anti-emetic, while 77% of the 157 who expressed a
preference said that smokable marijuana is more effective than
oral THC. A majority said that marijuana was no worse than
Marinol in terms of producing bad side-effects. </p>

<p>Adios for today. Back again manana. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #47-Notables </h3>

<p>Date: 95-03-02 12:25:41 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This is a column called &quot;Notable People for
Legalization&quot;. This column was published in the Daily Texan,
the student paper at The University of Texas. Most of the
columnist's research info came from Internet sources. </p>

<p>********* </p>

<p><b>Support swells for legal drugs</b> </p>

<p><b>Gabriel Demombynes</b> </p>

<p><b>TEXAN COLUMNIST</b> </p>

<p>In recent months, discussion of drug legalization has vaulted
from the pages of High Times and obscure academic journals onto
the front page of The New York Times. Prominent people are
talking seriously about changing the direction of America's drug
policy. </p>

<p>The shift in sentiment can be traced to an effort begun a year
ago in California. Several notable names gathered at Stanford
University's Hoover institution to draft and sign a letter
demanding a fresh look at drug policy. </p>

<p>The original signatories included Nobel-laureate economist
Milton Friedman, former Secretary of State George Shultz,
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and about 20 others. </p>

<p>Since the initial meeting, hundreds of doctors, businessmen,
attorneys, educators, judges and members of the clergy have
signed the resolution. Among them are the mayors and police
chiefs of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose; 20/20
correspondent Hugh Downs; and members of the California Medical
Association. </p>

<p>On Feb. 27, The New York Times printed a similar proclamation
by another Nobel laureate, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. He's convinced
more than 2,000 of his Latin American intellectual buddies to
sign the statement declaring that we must &quot;focus on the
various ways in which legalization can be administered. This
means putting an end to the self-seeking, pernicious, useless war
that the consuming countries have inflicted on us.&quot; </p>

<p>To protest the inanity of our drug policy, roughly 50 of the
nation's 680 federal judges now refuse to accept drug cases. One
researcher surveyed 450 judges, prosecutors, and defense
attorneys and found that 95 percent believe &quot;the drug war
has failed and more innovative measures are needed.&quot; </p>

<p>The Feb. 28 Time included a pro-legalization column by
respected writer Barbara Ehrenreich. Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders says that we would &quot;markedly reduce our crime
rate&quot; by legalizing drug use. The Economist last year
editorialized in favor of legalization. Conservative pundit
William Buckley has said, &quot;If you had all the facts, you
would agree like me that marijuana should be legal.&quot; </p>

<p>This political change has begun to gather momentum because the
Hoover signatories explicitly shied away from advocating a
specific new policy. Some favor merely making marijuana available
for medical uses. Others want comprehensive drug legalization. </p>

<p>All are part of the movement -- which has made for some
strange bedfellows. Just imagine Friedman phoning up Garcia
Marquez: </p>

<p>Friedman: &quot;Gabriel, it's Milt. What's say you and me and
Joy Elders get together to discuss this drug legalization
stuff?&quot; </p>

<p>Garcia Marquez: &quot;Last night I awoke from the desperate
slumber of a man who has tasted his lover's tears. In my bliss I
felt a prescient understanding. Next Tuesday two men and a woman
will meet on the zocalo in San Cristobal. While passionate men
die on the streets in the name of revolution, the three friends
will sip cafe con leche and whisper their desires.&quot; </p>

<p>Friedman: &quot;OK, so I'll see you Tuesday. But you're
buying. I don't carry any of that Mexican funny money.&quot; </p>

<p>The curious coalition shows no sign of breaking up. A proposal
now being considered in Congress would charge a national
commission with recommending a new national drug policy. The
resolution has 17 co-sponsors in the House and five backers in
the Senate. </p>

<p>Mark Smith, UT assistant professor of American studies and
history, teaches a class in the &quot;Cultural History of Alcohol
and Drugs.&quot; He says the hardliners &quot;have been
discredited because they've been in power and their results have
been absurd.&quot; </p>

<p>It's already possible to talk about legalization without
having a &quot;Dope Fiend&quot; label pasted across one's chest. </p>

<p>More tomorrow. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #48-AncientUse </h3>

<p>Date: 95-03-03 12:05:37 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Another interesting article I came across. This stuff's been
around for a LONG time. </p>

<p><b>USE OF MARIJUANA IN ANCIENT TIMES</b> </p>

<p>The use of marijuana is as old as the history of man and dates
to the prehistoric period. Marijuana is closely connected with
the history and development of some of the oldest nations on
earth. It has played a </p>

<p>significant role in the religions and cultures of Africa, the
Middle East, India, and China. </p>

<p>Richard E. Schultes, a prominent researcher in the field of
psychoactive plants, said in an article he wrote entitled
&quot;Man and Marijuana&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;...that early man experimented with all plant materials
that he could chew and could not have avoided discovering the
properties of cannabis (marijuana), for in his quest for seeds
and oil, he certainly ate the sticky tops of the plant. Upon
eating hemp the euphoric, ecstatic and hallucinatory aspects may
have introduced man to an other-worldly plane from which emerged
religious beliefs, perhaps even the concept of deity. The plant
became accepted as a special gift of the gods, a sacred medium
for communion with the spiritual world and as such it has
remained in some cultures to the present.&quot; </p>

<p>The effects of marijuana was proof to the ancients that the
spirit and power of the god(s) existed in this plant and that it
was literally a messenger (angel) or actually the Flesh and Blood
and/or Bread of the god(s) and was and continues to be a holy
sacrament. Considered to be sacred, marijuana has been used in
religious worship from before recorded history. </p>

<p>According to William A. Embolden in his book Ritual Use of
Cannabis Sativa L, p. 235: </p>

<p>&quot;Shamanistic traditions of great antiquity in Asia and
the Near East has as one of their most important elements the
attempt to find God without a vale of tears; that cannabis played
a role in this, at least in some areas, is born out in the
philology surrounding the ritualistic use of the plant. Whereas
Western religious traditions generally stress sin, repentance,
and mortification of the flesh, certain older non-Western
religious cults seem to have employed Cannabis as a euphoriant,
which allowed the participant a joyous path to the Ultimate;
hence such appellations as &quot;heavenly guide&quot;. </p>

<p>According to &quot;Licit and Illicit Drugs&quot; by the
Consumer Union, page 397-398: </p>

<p>&quot;Ashurbanipal lived about 650 B.C., but the cuneiform
descriptions of marijuana in his library &quot;are generally
regarded as obvious copies of much older texts.&quot; Says Dr.
Robert P. Walton, an American physician and authority on
marijuana, &quot;This evidence serves to project the origin of
hashish back to the earliest beginnings of history.&quot; </p>

<p>Berry interesting. </p>

<p><b>Death RATES among recreational drug users.</b> </p>

<p>The exact numbers vary, depending on the source and their
methodology. I have presented several sets of numbers here. In
general you will see that the vast amount of money/energy/etc.
applied to &quot;illicit&quot; drugs is quite misplaced if one is
counting deaths or death rate per user. You may have access in
your library to things like the Center for Disease Control
Mortality and Morbidity reports and yearly summaries. The last
one I looked at listed 800 something deaths a year for aspirin
(and more for acetominephin (sp?) and ibuprofen) - verses 0 for
cannabis (hemp/pot/marijuana/...). </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>These are references from the previous post. </p>

<p>(b) Estimates vary greatly, depending upon whether all health
consequences, or only those traditionally associated with
alcoholism, are considered. The Fifth Special Report to the U.S.
Congress on Alcoholism and Health from the Secretary of Health
and Human Services contains two references indicating a death
toll of 200,000: The report states, first, that alcohol
&quot;plays a role in 10% of all deaths in the United
States,&quot; which comes to about 200,000 deaths each year. P.
vi. It further states that present estimates of the death toll
from alcohol abuse are as high as 93.2 per 100,000. Ibid., p. x.
This ratio translates into a total of about 210,000. </p>

<p>(c) These figures were determined as follows: Drug Abuse
Warning Network (DAWN) heroin and cocaine fatalities for 1984,
1985, and 1986 were averaged. The number of suicides was
subtracted. The figures were discounted to account for deaths in
which both heroin and cocaine played a role. Since DAWN covers
about one-third of the nation's population but almost all major
urban areas where drug use florishes, totals were doubled to
arrive at yearly estimates of 2,000 for heroin deaths and 1,000
for cocaine deaths. Finally, these figures were dis-counted by 80
percent in accordance with the analysis presented in the text </p>

<p>This here information ain't about none of that maryjeewanna
stuff, but I found it interesting. Maybe you will too. I
personally feel it goes to show that people that are addicted to
substances are going to do them come hell or high water. The
others try it and say adios. I'm sure the &quot;drug
warriors&quot; can make something else out of these FACTS. They
might as well. They never seem to come up with any on there own. </p>

<p>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information </p>

<p>Preliminary Estimates from the 1993 National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse </p>

<p>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration </p>

<p>Office of Applied Studies </p>

<p>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health
Services </p>

<p>1993 National Household Survey </p>

<p>Cocaine Use </p>

<p>In 1992, an estimated 1.3 million Americans were current
cocaine users. This represents 0.6 percent of the population aged
12 and older. </p>

<p>The number of cocaine users did not change between 1992 and
1993. It had been 5.3 million in 1985 (2.7 percent of the
population) and 1.9 million in 1991 (0.9 percent). This
represents a significant decrease in use between 1985 and 1993
and between 1991 and 1993. </p>

<p>There were an estimated one-half million (476,000, or 0.2
percent of the population) frequent cocaine users in 1993.
Frequent use, defined as use on a weekly basis during the past
year, was not significantly different than in 1992, when there
were an estimated 642,000. Since this measure of frequent cocaine
use was first estimated in 1985, no significant increases or
decreases have been detected by the NHSDA. It should be noted
that these estimates are subject to large sampling error and
potentially large nonsampling error. </p>

<p>However, the estimated number of occasional cocaine users
(people who used in the past year but less often than monthly)
has sharply declined from 8.1 million in 1985 to 3.0 million in
1993. </p>

<p>The estimated number of current crack users was less than
one-half million in 1993 and there has been no indication of any
increases or decreases in crack use since 1991. </p>

<p>Approximately 60 percent of current cocaine users were age
18-34 in 1993. As in the past, the rate of current cocaine use in
1993 was highest among 18-25 year olds (1.5 percent) and 26-34
year olds (1.0 percent). Rates were 0.4 percent for 12-17 year
olds and 0.4 percent for adults aged 35 and older. </p>

<p>The past month cocaine use prevalence rate for the 12-17 year
old age group has decreased from 1.4 percent in 1985 to 0.4
percent in 1993. Similarly, 18-25 year olds have seen dramatic
decreases in prevalence from 7.5 percent in 1985 to 1.5 percent
in 1993. For the 26-34 year old age group, the rate has declined
from 5.9 percent to 1.0 percent. The rate for persons age 35 and
older has shown variability but remained virtually unchanged
since 1985 (0.4 percent in 1985 and 0.4 percent in 1993). </p>

<p>The 1993 survey continued to show higher rates of cocaine use
among blacks (1.3 percent) and Hispanics (1.1 percent), compared
with whites (0.5 percent) Fifty-nine percent of current cocaine
users were white in 1993. Blacks comprised 23 percent and
Hispanics another 16 percent. During the peak year for cocaine
use (1985), whites comprised 80 percent, blacks comprised 13
percent, and Hispanics comprised 6 percent. </p>

<p>Significant decreases in use have been seen since 1985 for
whites (2.8 percent in 1985 and 0.5 percent in 1993), blacks (3.1
percent in 1985 and 1.3 percent in 1993) and Hispanics (2.3
percent in 1985 and 1.1 percent in 1993). </p>

<p>(See Appendix 2 for discussion of trends among blacks.) </p>

<p>Men continued to have a higher rate of current cocaine use
than women (0.9 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, in 1993). </p>

<p>Significant decreases occurred for both men and women between
1985 and 1993. Rates had been 3.6 percent for men and 1.9 percent
for women in 1985. </p>

<p>In 1993 the rate of cocaine use was 0.8 percent in the West
region, 0.7 in the Northeast region, 0.6 percent in the South
region, and 0.5 percent in the North Central. </p>

<p><b>1993 National Household Survey</b> </p>

<p><b>Marijuana and Hashish Use</b> </p>

<p>In 1993, an estimated 9 million Americans were current
marijuana or hashish users. This represents 4.3 percent of the
population aged 12 and older. </p>

<p>Marijuana is by far the most prevalent drug used by illicit
drug users, as about three quarters (77 percent) of current (past
month) illicit drug users were marijuana or hashish users in
1993. Because of this, trends and demographic differences are
generally similar for any illicit use and marijuana/hashish use.
The number of marijuana and hashish users did not change between
1992 and 1993 (9.0 million in both years). However, use has
declined significantly since 1985, when there were 17.8 million
users. The rate of use declined from 9.3 percent in 1985 to 4.3
percent in 1993. </p>

<p>Frequent use of marijuana, defined as use on a weekly basis
during the past year, remained unchanged from 1991 through 1993
at about 5.1 million weekly users (2.4 percent of the population
in 1993) but was significantly lower than in 1985, when there
were an estimated 8.9 million weekly users (4.6 percent of the
population). </p>

<p>Trends in marijuana and hashish use by age group are similar
to the trends for any illicit drug use. Rates for 12-17 year
olds, 18-25 year olds and 26-34 year olds were significantly
lower in 1993 than for those age groups in 1985. There was no
change in the rate of use for the 35 and older age group. </p>

<p>The rate of marijuana use for 12-17 year olds was 4.0 percent
in 1992 and 4.9 percent in 1993. While this is not a
statistically significant change, it is still noteworthy given
the recently reported increase in marijuana prevalence among high
school students surveyed in the Monitoring the Future Study
(levels of prevalence are different in the two studies because of
different populations covered and different methodologies used).
In fact, the NHSDA did find a significant increase in past year
marijuana use among youths (8.1 percent in 1992 and 10.1 percent
in 1993). </p>

<p>Differences in rates of use between demographic groups were
also similar to the differences described above for any illicit
drug. </p>

<p>Later on folks and have a great day, even you grammone ;) </p>

<p>....continued from previous post. </p>

<p>Since 1985, the difference in cocaine prevalence by population
density has narrowed. The rate dropped significantly in large
metropolitan areas from 3.6 percent in 1985 to 0.6 percent in
1993, in small metropolitan areas from 2.3 percent to 0.7
percent, and in non metropolitan areas (1.7 percent in 1985 and
0.6 percent in 1993). </p>

<p>Current cocaine use rates remained highly correlated with
educational status. Among 18-34 year olds in 1993, those who had
not completed high school had a current use rate of 2.4 percent.
The rate was 1.3 percent among those with just a high school
education, 0.7 percent among those with some college, and 0.8
percent among college graduates. </p>

<p>66 percent of all adult (age 18 and older) current cocaine
users in 1993 were employed either full or part time. This
reflects an estimated 0.8 million adult employed cocaine users. </p>

<p>The rate of current cocaine use was highest among the
unemployed, as 2.3 percent of unemployed adults were current
cocaine users in 1993, compared with only 0.7 percent of employed
adults. </p>

<p>It seems like education has reduced the number of people using
Alcohol part-time. The full time drunks remain the same. These
statistics somewhat match the stats for the decrease in Cocaine
use. I conclude that the laws make no difference; only education
and drug abuse awareness work. Remember not all people that use
alcohol are alcoholics. Not all people that use drugs are drug
addicts. And there are even people that only smoke cigarettes
when they are drinking and are not cigarette addicts. </p>

<p><b>1993 National Household Survey </b></p>

<p><b>Alcohol Use</b> </p>

<p>Estimates of the prevalence of alcohol use are presented in
terms of current use (any use in the past month) and heavy use.
For this report, heavy alcohol use is defined as drinking five or
more drinks per occasion on 5 or more days in the past month. </p>

<p>In 1993, approximately 103 million persons age 12 and over had
used alcohol in the past month, which was about 50 percent of the
total population age 12 and older. About 11 million Americans
(5.3 percent of the population) were heavy drinkers. </p>

<p>Alcohol usage was significantly lower in 1993 than it was in
1985 when 58 percent of the population (112 million) were
drinkers. Heavy alcohol use has changed little since 1985 when
the rate was 6.3 percent and there were an estimated 12 million
heavy drinkers. </p>

<p>Heavy drinkers were more likely to be illicit drug users in
1993. Of the 11 million heavy drinkers, 25.5 percent (3 million
people) were current illicit drug users. Among the 92 million
current drinkers who were not heavy drinkers, the rate of illicit
drug use was 7.6 percent. </p>

<p>For 1993, the rate of drinking remained highest among the 18
to 34 year olds with about 61 percent having used alcohol in the
past month. Current usage was 18 percent in the 12-17 age group
and 49 percent in the 35 and older age group in 1993. In 1993
there were 3.8 million current drinkers in the 12-17 age group,
16.8 million drinkers in the 18-25 age group, 23.3 million
drinkers in the 26-34 age group, and 58.8 million drinkers age 35
and older. </p>

<p>The 18-34 year olds also had the highest rate of heavy
drinking at 8.5 percent, with 10.4 percent of 18-25 year olds and
7.3 percent of 26-34 year olds reporting heavy drinking. </p>

<p>Following a decrease from 20.3 percent in 1991 to 15.7 percent
in 1992, the rate of current alcohol use among 12-17 year olds
increased to 18.0 percent in 1993. The 1993 rate is significantly
lower than it had been in 1985, when it was 31.0 percent. </p>

<p>In 1993, whites continued to have the highest rate of alcohol
use at 53 percent. Rates for Hispanics and blacks were 46 percent
and 38 percent, respectively. Rates of heavy use showed no
statistically significant differences by race/ethnicity (5.7
percent for whites, 5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 4.3 percent
for blacks). </p>

<p>Fifty-seven percent of men were past month alcohol users,
compared with 43 percent of women. Men were much more likely than
women to be heavy drinkers (9.5 and 1.5 percent, respectively). A
significant decrease in heavy drinking among women was seen in
1993. </p>

<p>The rate of current alcohol use was 54 percent in the
Northeast and West regions, 49 percent in the North Central
region, and 45 percent in the South in 1993. Heavy alcohol use
was 5.9 percent in Northeast and North Central, 5.5 percent in
the West and 4.5 percent in the South. </p>

<p>Since 1985, the difference in current alcohol prevalence by
population density has narrowed. The rate dropped significantly
in large metropolitan areas from 65 percent in 1985 to 52 percent
in 1993 and in small metropolitan areas from 56 percent to 48
percent, but has not significantly dropped in non metropolitan
areas. </p>

<p>Heavy alcohol use has dropped significantly in large
metropolitan areas (6.7 percent in 1985 and 4.1 percent in 1993)
but changed little in other areas. The rate of heavy drinking was
lower in large metropolitan areas than in small metropolitan
areas (6.2 percent) and non metropolitan areas (6.5 percent) in
1993. </p>

<p>In contrast to the pattern for illicit drugs, the higher the
level of educational attainment, the more likely was the current
use of alcohol. In 1993, 64 percent of adults with college
degrees were current drinkers, compared with only 36 percent of
those having less than a high school education. Among 18-34 year
olds, 69.6 percent of those with college degrees were current
alcohol users in 1993, compared with only 49.6 percent of those
having less than a high school education. However, the rate of
heavy alcohol use in this age group was 4.4 percent among those
who had completed college and 11.3 percent among those who had
not completed high school. </p>

<p>What's this? Do I see a trend? It appears that education is
working on lowering the rate of tobacco use in this country. The
same as it has done with alcohol. And the same as it has done
with other drug abuse. If money were spent on education instead
of proping-up Columbian drug lords, we may see a greater decrease
in drug abuse. For those that say the laws have reduced drug use,
I say bollocks. The laws didn't stop anyone from starting their
illicit drug use. </p>

<p><b>1993 National Household Survey</b> </p>

<p><b>Tobacco Use</b> </p>

<p>An estimated 50 million Americans were current smokers in
1993. This represents a smoking rate of 24 percent for the
population age 12 and older. </p>

<p>Current cigarette smoking declined from 26 percent to 24
percent between 1992 and 1993. In 1985, 31 percent of the
population, or 60 million Americans, had been smokers. </p>

<p>Current smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers and
illicit drug users. Among smokers, the rate of heavy alcohol use
(five or more drinks on five or more days in the past month) was
11.1 percent and the rate of current illicit drug use was 12.3
percent. Among nonsmokers, only 3.4 percent were heavy drinkers
and 3.5 percent were illicit drug users. </p>

<p>An estimated 6.1 million Americans (2.9 percent of the
population) were current users of smokeless tobacco in 1993. </p>

<p>The rate of smoking was highest in the 26-34 year old age
group (30 percent) and the 18-25 year old age group (29 percent).
Rates were 24 percent among adults age 35 and older and 10
percent among 12-17 year olds. More than 2 million 12-17 year
olds were smokers in 1993. </p>

<p>Decreases in smoking since 1985 were apparent in every age
group. However, rates for 12-17 year olds appear to have
stabilized, as the rate was 9.6 percent in both 1992 and 1993. </p>

<p>In 1993, no significant differences in smoking rates by
race/ethnicity were found. Smokeless tobacco use was more
prevalent among whites (3.5 percent) than among blacks (1.5
percent) or Hispanics (1.1 percent). </p>

<p>Among adults, men had somewhat higher rates of smoking than
women, but rates of smoking were similar for males and females
aged 12-17. </p>

<p>Since 1985, the rate of smoking decreased among men (35
percent in 1985 and 26 percent in 1993), and among women (28
percent in 1985 and 22 percent in 1993). </p>

<p>The rate of smokeless tobacco use was significantly higher for
men than for women in 1993 (5.9 percent vs. 0.2 percent). Over 96
percent of smokeless tobacco users were men. </p>

<p>The rate of current cigarette use was similar across regions,
ranging from 23 percent to 25 percent in 1993. The rate of
smoking was 22 percent in large metropolitan areas, 25 percent in
small metropolitan areas, and 28 percent in non metropolitan
areas. </p>

<p>Level of educational attainment was correlated with tobacco
usage. Thirty-five percent of adults who had not completed high
school smoked cigarettes, while only 15 percent of college
graduates smoked. </p>

<p>This is an organization I came across. I will try to have the
next series of posts dedicated to the atrocities of minimum
sentences. Remember, &quot;Send a druggie to jail-- set a rapist
free&quot;. </p>

<p><b>FAMM: Families Against Mandatory Minimums</b> </p>

<p>Who's on drugs? You or the Feds? </p>

<p>The feds think you should spend more time in jail for doing
drugs than for rape or attempted murder. </p>

<p>In 1986, Congress passed laws that forced judges to give fixed
sentences to offenders convicted of drug crimes. In 1988,
Congress added certain gun crimes to the list of offenses that
required a minimum number of years behind bars, without parole.
These mandatory minimum sentences were determined solely by the
weight of the drugs, or the presence of a firearm at a drug
crime. </p>

<p>The sentences are mandatory in that judges must impose them,
regardless of the defendant's role in the offense, his
culpability, likelihood of rehabilitation, or any other
mitigating factors. Many states have adopted similar mandatory
minimum sentences (MMS). </p>

<p>What's wrong with MMS? </p>

<p>Mandatory minimum sentences undermine the basic traditions of
justice that Americans have enjoyed for 200 years -- that the
punishment fit the crime. </p>

<p>They strip judges of their power to determine the appropriate
sentence based on all of the facts of the case. They give
low-level offenders longer sentences than most king-pins. The
only way to avoid a mandatory minimum is to provide substantial
assistance to the prosecutor in exchange for a reduction in
sentence. Unlike the organizer, the minor player seldom has
valuable information to trade for a lower sentence. </p>

<p>Sending low-level offenders to prison overloads the prison
system and costs taxes payers a lot of money. They create
sentencing disparities based on race. Studies show that Blacks
and Hispanics are more likely to receive mandatory minimum
sentences more often than whites charged with the same crime.
(U.S. Sentencing Commission Report, 1991). </p>

I will either post or e-mail address. </p>

<p>Congress has established that a marijuana plant be treated as
1000 grams of marijuana for sentencing purposes involving 50 or
more plants even though it is stated in the Sentencing
Guidelines, that a mature marijuana plant produces on the average
only 100 grams. In cases less than 50 plants the guidelines use
100 grams per plant or the actual weight of useable marijuana,
whichever is greater. This is a 10 to 1 disparity and it is
wrong! </p>

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission is considering various proposed

<p><b>The Cost of Mandatory Minimums</b> </p>

<p>What do mandatory minimums cost taxpayers? </p>

<p>The average cost of incarcerating a federal inmate is $20,804
per year. (Bureau of Prisons, 1994) </p>

<p>Sixty-two percent of federal inmates are drug offenders, and
half of them are first offenders. (Bureau of Prisons testimony,
May 1993). </p>

<p>To feed, clothe, house, and guard the 54,000 federal drug
inmates costs taxpayers over $1.1 billion per year. </p>

<p>The Bureaus of Prisons budget increased by 1,350 percent
between 1982 and FY 1993, to a total of $2.3 billion annually.
(National Drug Control Strategy Budget Summary, 1992). </p>

<p>States spend more of their budgets on justice programs (6.4%)
than on housing and he environment (3.8) and nearly as much as on
health care (8.9%) (Bureau of Justice Statistics, September,
1992). </p>

<p>It costs more to send a person to prison for four years than
it does to send him to a private university for four years,
including tuition, fees, room, board, books and supplies. (Bureau

<p>What is not mentioned here is the fact that most of the people

should be let out and put back to work. I'm tired of my tax

supporting themselves. I rather the govt. spend my money feeding

<p>I am reposting this article from Atlantic Monthly. Just some
more enlightenment for those that need some. For those that are,
it makes for some interesting reading. </p>

<p><b>8/94: REEFER MADNESS (part 1)</b> </p>

<p>8/94: REEFER MADNESS </p>

<p>Marijuana has not been de facto legalized, and the war on
drugs is not just about cocaine and heroin. In fact, today, when
we don't have enough jail cells for murderers, rapists, and other
violent criminals, there may be more people in federal and state
prisons for marijuana offenses than at any other time in U.S.
history. </p>

<p>by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Copyright 1994, The Atlantic Monthly. </p>

<p>In the state of Indiana a person convicted of armed robbery
will serve about five years in prison; someone convicted of rape
will serve about twelve; and a convicted murderer can expect to
spend twenty years behind bars. These figures are actually higher
than the figures nationwide: eight years and eight months in
prison is the average punishment for an American found guilty of
murder. The prison terms given by Indiana judges tend to be long,
but with good behavior an inmate will serve no more than half the
nominal sentence. </p>

<p>Those facts are worth keeping in mind when considering the
case of Mark Young. At the age of thirty-eight Young was arrested
at his Indianapolis home for brokering the sale of 700 pounds of
marijuana grown on a farm in nearby Morgan County. Young was
tried and convicted under federal law. He had never before been
charged with drug trafficking. He had no history of violent
crime. Young's role in the illegal transaction had been that of a
middleman--he never distributed the drugs; he simply introduced
two people hoping to sell a large amount of marijuana to three
people wishing to buy it. The offense occurred a year and a half
prior to his arrest. No confiscated marijuana, money, or physical
evidence of any kind linked Young to the crime. </p>

<p>He was convicted solely on the testimony of co-conspirators
who were now cooperating with the government. On February 8,
1992, Mark Young was sentenced by Judge Sarah Evans Barker to
life imprisonment without possibility of parole. (Poster's
Note--Remember, &quot;Send a druggie to jail--set </p>

<p>a rapist free&quot;) </p>

<p>There was so much talk in the 1970s about the
decriminalization of marijuana, and the smoking of marijuana is
so casually taken for granted in much of our culture, that many
people assume that a marijuana offense these days will rarely
lead to a prison term. But in fact there may be more people in
prison today for violating marijuana laws than at any other time
in the nation's history. Calculations based on data provided by
the Bureau of Prisons and the United States Sentencing Commission
suggest that one of every six inmates in the federal prison
system--roughly 15,000 people--has been incarcerated primarily
for a marijuana offense. The number currently being held in state
prisons and local jails is more difficult to estimate; a
conservative guess would be an additional 20,000 to 30,000. And
Mark Young's sentence, though unusual, is by no means unique. A
dozen or more marijuana offenders may now be serving life
sentences in federal penitentiaries without hope of parole; if
one includes middle-aged inmates with sentences of twenty or
thirty or forty years, the number condemned to die in prison may
reach into the </p>

<p>hundreds. Other inmates--no one knows how many--are serving
life sentences in state correctional facilities across the
country for growing, selling, or even possessing marijuana. </p>

<p>More of this article to come over the next several days. </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Part 2.</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>The phrase &quot;war on drugs&quot; evokes images of Colombian
cartels and inner-city crack addicts. In many ways that is a
misperception. Marijuana is and has long been the most widely
used illegal drug in the United States. It is used here more
frequently than all other illegal drugs combined. According to
conservative estimates, one third of the American population over
the age of eleven has smoked marijuana at least once. More than
17 million Americans smoked it in 1992. At least three million
smoke it on a daily basis. Unlike heroin or cocaine, which must
be imported, anywhere from a quarter to half of the marijuana
used in this country is grown here as well. Although popular
stereotypes depict marijuana growers as aging hippies in northern
California or Hawaii, the majority of the marijuana now
cultivated in the United States is being grown in the nation's
midsection--a swath running roughly from the Appalachians west to
the Great Plains. Throughout this Marijuana Belt drug fortunes
are being made by farmers who often seem to have stepped from a
page of the old Saturday Evening Post. The value of America's
annual marijuana crop is staggering: plausible estimates start at
$4 billion and range up to $24 billion. In 1993 the value of the
nation's largest legal cash crop, corn, was roughly $16 billion. </p>

<p>Marijuana has well-organized supporters who campaign for its
legalization and promote its use through books, magazines, and
popular music. They regard marijuana as not only a benign
recreational drug but also a form of herbal medicine and a
product with industrial applications. Marijuana's opponents are
equally passionate and far better organized. They consider
marijuana a dangerous drug--one that harms the user's mental,
physical, and spiritual well-being, promotes irresponsible sexual
behavior, and encourages disrespect for traditional values. At
the heart of the ongoing bitter debate is a hardy weed that can
grow wild in all fifty states. The two sides agree that countless
lives have been destroyed by marijuana, but disagree about what
should be blamed: the plant itself, or the laws forbidding its
use. </p>

<p>The war on drugs embraced by President Ronald Reagan began
largely as a campaign against marijuana organized by conservative
parents' groups in the late 1970s. After more than a decade in
which penalties for marijuana offenses had been reduced at both
the state and federal levels, the laws regarding marijuana were
made much tougher in the 1980s. More resources were devoted to
their enforcement, and punishments more severe than those
administered during the &quot;reefer madness&quot; of the 1930s
became routine. All the legal tools commonly associated with the
fight against heroin and cocaine trafficking--civil forfeitures,
enhanced police search powers, the broad application of
conspiracy laws, a growing reliance on the testimony of
informers, and mechanistic sentencing formulas, such as mandatory
minimums and &quot;three strikes, you're out&quot;--have been
employed against marijuana offenders. The story of how Mark Young
got a life sentence reveals a great deal about the emergence of
the American heartland as the region where a vast amount of the
nation's marijuana is now grown; about the changing composition
of the federal prison population; and about the effects of the
war on drugs, a dozen years after its declaration, throughout
America's criminal-justice system. Underlying Young's tale is a
simple question: How does a society come to punish a person more
harshly for selling marijuana than for killing someone with a
gun? (Poster's Note--Remember: &quot;Send a druggie, set a
MURDERER free) </p>

&quot;dagga,&quot; in China as &quot;ma,&quot; in Northern Europe
as &quot;hemp.&quot; Although cannabis most likely originated in
the steppes of central Asia, it now thrives in almost any
climate, spreading like milkweed or thistle, crowding out
neighboring grasses and reaching heights of three to twenty feet
at maturity. Marijuana has been cultivated for at least 5,000
years; it is one of the oldest agricultural commodities not grown
for food. The stalks of the plant contain fibers that have been
woven for millennia to make rope, canvas, and paper. Cannabis is
dioecious, spawning male and female plants in equal proportion.
The flowering buds of the female--and to a lesser extent those of
the male--secrete a sticky yellow resin rich with cannabinoids,
the more than sixty compounds unique to marijuana. Several of
them are psychoactive, most prominently
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). </p>

<p>Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School, believes that marijuana will someday be
hailed as a &quot;miracle drug,&quot; one that is safe,
inexpensive, and versatile. In his book Marihuana, the Forbidden
Medicine (1993) Grinspoon provides anecdotal evidence that
smoking marijuana can relieve the nausea associated with
chemotherapy, prevent blindness induced by glaucoma, serve as an
appetite stimulant for AIDS patients, act as an anti-epileptic,
ward off asthma attacks and migraine headaches, alleviate chronic
pain, and reduce the muscle spasticity that accompanies multiple
sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia. Other doctors think
that Grinspoon is wildly optimistic, and that no &quot;crude
drug&quot; like marijuana--composed of more than 400
chemicals--should be included in the modern pharmacopoeia. They
point out that effective synthetic drugs, of precise dosage and
purity, have been developed for every one of marijuana's
potential uses. Dronabinol, a synthetic form of delta-9-THC, has
been available for years, though some clinical oncologists find
it inferior to marijuana as an anti-nausea agent. There have been
remarkably few large-scale studies that might verify or disprove
Grinspoon's claims. Nevertheless, thirty-six states allow the
medicinal use of marijuana, and eight patients are currently
receiving it from the Public Health Service. According to
Grinspoon, the federal government has always been far more
interested in establishing marijuana's harmful effects than in
discovering any of its benefits, while major drug companies have
little incentive to fund expensive research on marijuana. As
Grinspoon explains, &quot;You cannot patent this plant.&quot; </p>

<p>The long-term health effects of chronic marijuana use, and
marijuana's role as a &quot;gateway&quot; to the use of other
illegal drugs, are issues surrounded by great controversy.
Marijuana does not create a physical dependence in its users, but
it does create a psychological dependence in some. People who
smoke marijuana are far more likely to experiment later with
other psychoactive drugs, but no direct cause-and-effect
relationship has ever been established. Delta-9-THC is highly
lipid-soluble and has a half-life of five days, which means that
it diffuses widely throughout the human body and remains there
for quite some time: an occasional user can fail a urine test
three days after smoking a single joint, and a heavy user may
test positive after abstaining from marijuana for more than a
month. Delta-9-THC's persistence within various cells and vital
organs (also a characteristic of Valium, Thorazine, and quinine)
suggests that it could have the ability to exert subtly harmful
effects; few have yet been proved. </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Part 4</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>Studies of lifelong heavy marijuana users in Jamaica, Greece,
and Costa Rica reveal little psychological or physiological
damage. Much more research, however, needs to be done in the
areas of cognition, reproduction, and immunology. Adolescent
users in particular would be at risk if marijuana were found to
have pernicious systemic effects. Some studies have shown that
short-term memory deficiencies in heavy smokers, though
reversible, may endure long after the cessation of marijuana use.
Other studies have demonstrated in vitro and in laboratory
animals that marijuana may have a mild immunosuppressive effect,
but no study has conclusively linked delta-9-THC to immune-system
changes in human beings. Well-publicized horror stories from the
1970s--that marijuana kills brain cells, damages chromosomes, and
prompts men to grow breasts--were based on faulty research. </p>

<p>Smoking marijuana does seem to damage the pulmonary system, in
some of the ways that inhaling tobacco smoke does. In a study of
people who have smoked four or five joints a day for more than
ten years, the physician Donald P. Tashkin, of the University of
California at Los Angeles Medical Center, has found substantial
evidence that marijuana smoke can cause chronic bronchitis,
changes in cells of the central airway which are potentially
pre-cancerous, and an impairment in scavenger-cell function which
could lead to a risk of respiratory infection. A joint seems to
deliver four times as much carcinogenic tar as a tobacco
cigarette of the same size. Tashkin expects that some heavy
marijuana users will eventually suffer cancers of the mouth,
throat, and lungs, although none of his research subjects has yet
developed a malignancy. Oddly enough, the more potent strains of
marijuana may prove less dangerous, since less of them needs to
be smoked. </p>

<p>There is much less disagreement about the short-term health
effects of marijuana. According to the physician Leo Hollister, a
former president of the American College of
Neuropsychopharmacology, who now teaches at the University of
Texas, the occasional use of marijuana by a healthy adult poses
no greater risks than the moderate consumption of alcohol. For a
variety of reasons, however, marijuana should not be smoked by
schizophrenics, pregnant women, and people with heart conditions.
</p>

<p>Although the misuse of over-the-counter medications such as
aspirin, acetaminophen, and antihistamines each year kills
hundreds of Americans, not a single death has ever been credibly
attributed directly to smoking or consuming marijuana in the
5,000 years of the plant's recorded use. Marijuana is one of the
few therapeutically active substances known to man for which
there is no well-defined fatal dose. It has been estimated that a
person would have to smoke a hundred pounds of marijuana a minute
for fifteen minutes in order to induce a lethal response. </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>Criminalized, Decriminalized, Recriminalized </p>

<p>The first American law pertaining to marijuana, passed by the
Virginia Assembly in 1619, required every farmer to grow it. Hemp
was deemed not only a valuable commodity but also a strategic
necessity; its fibers were used to make sails and riggings, and
its by-products were transformed into oakum for the caulking of
wooden ships. Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland eventually
allowed hemp to be exchanged as legal tender, in order to
stimulate its production and relieve Colonial money shortages.
Although a number of the Founding Fathers, including George
Washington and Thomas Jefferson, later grew hemp on their
estates, there is no evidence that they were aware of the plant's
psychoactive properties. The domestic production of hemp
flourished, especially in Kentucky, until after the Civil War,
when it was replaced by imports from Russia and by other domestic
materials. In the latter half of the nineteenth century marijuana
became a popular ingredient in patent medicines and was sold
openly at pharmacies in one-ounce herbal packages and in
alcohol-based tinctures as a cure for migraines, rheumatism, and
insomnia. </p>

<p>The political upheaval in Mexico that culminated in the
Revolution of 1910 led to a wave of Mexican immigration to states
throughout the American Southwest. The prejudices and fears that
greeted these peasant immigrants also extended to their
traditional means of intoxication: smoking marijuana. Police
officers in Texas claimed that marijuana incited violent crimes,
aroused a &quot;lust for blood,&quot; and gave its users
&quot;superhuman strength.&quot; Rumors spread that Mexicans were
distributing this &quot;killer weed&quot; to unsuspecting
American schoolchildren. Sailors and West Indian immigrants
brought the practice of smoking marijuana to port cities along
the Gulf of Mexico. In New Orleans newspaper articles associated
the drug with African-Americans, jazz musicians, prostitutes, and
underworld whites. &quot;The Marijuana Menace,&quot; as sketched
by anti-drug campaigners, was personified by inferior races and
social deviants. In 1914 El Paso, Texas, enacted perhaps the
first U.S. ordinance banning the sale or possession of marijuana;
by 1931 twenty-nine states had outlawed marijuana, usually with
little fanfare or debate. Amid the rise of anti-immigrant
sentiment fueled by the Great Depression, public officials from
the Southwest and from Louisiana petitioned the Treasury
Department to outlaw marijuana. Their efforts were aided by a
lurid propaganda campaign. &quot;Murder Weed Found Up and Down
Coast,&quot; one headline warned; &quot;Deadly Marijuana Dope
Plant Ready For Harvest That Means Enslavement of California
Children.&quot; Harry J. Anslinger, the commissioner of the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, at first doubted the seriousness of
the problem and the need for federal legislation, but soon he
pursued the goal of a nationwide marijuana prohibition with
enormous gusto. In public appearances and radio broadcasts
Anslinger asserted that the use of this &quot;evil weed&quot; led
to killings, sex crimes, and insanity. </p>

<p>He wrote sensational magazine articles with titles like
&quot;Marijuana: Assassin of Youth.&quot; In 1937 Congress passed
the Marijuana Tax Act, effectively criminalizing the possession
of marijuana throughout the United States. A week after it went
into effect, a fifty-eight-year-old marijuana dealer named Samuel
R. Caldwell became the first person convicted under the new
statute. Although marijuana offenders had been treated leniently
under state and local laws, Judge J. Foster Symes, of Denver,
lectured Caldwell on the viciousness of marijuana and sentenced
him to four hard years at Leavenworth Penitentiary. </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Part 6</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>Harry J. Anslinger is a central figure in the history of
American drug policy. He headed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
from its inception through five presidential Administrations
spanning more than three decades. Anslinger had much in common
with his rival, J. Edgar Hoover. Both were conservative,
staunchly anti-communist proponents of law and order who imbued
nascent federal bureaus with their own idiosyncracies (Poster's
Note: The big question is --Did they both wear skirts?).
Anslinger did not believe in a public-health approach to drug
addiction; he dismissed treatment clinics as &quot;morphine
feeding stations&quot; and &quot;barrooms for addicts.&quot; In
his view, strict enforcement of the law was the only proper
response to illegal drug use; he urged judges to &quot;jail
offenders, then throw away the key.&quot; Anslinger's outlook was
consistent with that of most Americans, though his opinions
proved more resistant to new scientific evidence. When the New
York Academy of Medicine--after years of research--issued a
report in 1944 concluding that marijuana use did not cause
violent behavior, provoke insanity, lead to addiction, or promote
opiate use, Anslinger angrily dismissed its authors as
&quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;strange.&quot; </p>

<p>America's drug problem often seemed the work of foreign
powers: during the Second World War, Anslinger accused the
Japanese of using narcotics to sap America's will to fight; a few
years later he asserted that Communists were attempting the same
ploy. The Boggs Act, passed by Congress at the height of the
McCarthy era, specified the same penalties for marijuana and
heroin offenses--two to five years in prison for first-time
possession. As justification for the long sentences contained in
that act and in the Narcotic Control Act, which followed in 1956,
Anslinger stressed marijuana's crucial role as a
&quot;stepping-stone&quot; to narcotics addiction. Like Hoover,
he maintained dossiers on well-known entertainers whose behavior
seemed un-American. Anslinger disliked jazz and kept a special
file, &quot;Marijuana and Musicians,&quot; filled with reports on
band members who played with Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Les
Brown, Count Basie, Jimmy Dorsey, and Duke Ellington, among
others. For months Anslinger planned a nationwide roundup of
popular musicians--a scheme that was foiled by the inability of
FBN agents to infiltrate the jazz milieu. Although Anslinger's
opposition to drug use was both passionate and sincere, he made
one notable exception. In his memoir, The Murderers, Anslinger
confessed to having arranged a regular supply of morphine for
&quot;one of the most influential members of Congress,&quot; who
had become an addict. Anslinger's biographer believes that addict
was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (Poster's Note: Look at his
(McCarthy's) personallity. It FITS). </p>

<p>By 1962, when Harry J. Anslinger retired, many states had
passed &quot;little Boggs Acts&quot; with penalties for marijuana
possession or sale tougher than those demanded by federal law. In
Louisiana sentences for simple possession ranged from five to
ninety-nine years; in Missouri a second offense could result in a
life sentence; and in Georgia a second conviction for selling
marijuana to minors could bring the death penalty. As the
political climate changed during the 1960s, so did attitudes
toward drug abuse. A series of commissions appointed by
Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson repudiated some of
the basic assumptions that had guided marijuana policy for more
than fifty years, denying a direct link between the drug and
violent crime or heroin use. As marijuana use became widespread
among white middle-class college students, there was a
reappraisal of marijuana laws that for decades had imprisoned
poor Mexicans and African-Americans without much public dissent. </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Part 7</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>Drug-abuse policy shifted from a purely criminal-justice
approach to one also motivated by interests of public health,
with more emphasis on treatment than on punishment. In 1970 the
Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act finally
differentiated marijuana from other narcotics and reduced federal
penalties for possession of small amounts. As directed by
Congress, President Richard Nixon appointed a bipartisan
commission to study marijuana. In 1972 the Shafer Commission
issued its report, advocating the decriminalization of marijuana
for personal use--a recommendation that Nixon flatly rejected.
Nevertheless, eleven states, containing a third of the country's
population, decriminalized marijuana in the 1970s, and most other
states weakened their laws against it. President Jimmy Carter
endorsed decriminalization, and it seemed that long prison
sentences for marijuana offenders had been consigned to the
nation's past. </p>

<p>But they had not. One of the seminal events in the creation of
the modern American anti-drug movement was a backyard barbecue
held in Atlanta, Georgia, during August of 1976. In the aftermath
of their daughter's birthday party, Ron and Marsha Manatt combed
through the wet grass in their pajamas, at one in the morning,
with flashlights, finding dozens of marijuana roaches,
rolling-paper packets, and empty bottles of Mad Dog 20/20
fortified wine discarded by their twelve- and thirteen-year-old
guests. Alarmed by these discoveries, the Manatts gathered local
parents in their living room and formed what was soon known as
the Nosy Parents Association, a group dedicated to preventing
teenage drug use. Marsha Manatt wrote to Robert DuPont, the head
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; he helped arrange her
introduction to Thomas Gleaton, a professor of health education
at Georgia State University. There soon arose the Parents'
Resource Institute for Drug Education and the National Federation
of Parents for Drug-Free Youth, two organizations backed by top
officials at NIDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
which would exert tremendous influence on the nation's drug
policies. Thousands of other parents' groups soon formed
nationwide, and Ross Perot helped launch the Texans' War on
Drugs. </p>

<p>Marijuana use seemed epidemic: a survey in 1976 found that one
out of twelve high school seniors smoked pot on a daily basis. In
the 1960s the youth counterculture had celebrated marijuana's
reputation as a drug for outcasts and freaks. One Yippie leader
had confidently predicted that the slogan of the coming
revolution would be &quot;pot, freedom, license.&quot; The
conservative parents' groups took such words to heart and
similarly invested marijuana with great meaning. Robert DuPont,
who at NIDA had once supported decriminalization, later decried
the &quot;tumultuous change in values&quot; among the
young--their pursuit of pleasure, their lack of responsibility to
society--and argued that &quot;the leading edge of this cultural
change was marijuana use.&quot; </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Part 8</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>The election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency brought the
war on drugs to the White House. In June of 1982 President Reagan
signed an executive order creating a new post in his
Administration--head of the White House Drug Abuse Policy
Office--and appointed a chemist, Carlton Turner, to the job.
Turner had for many years directed the Marijuana Research Project
at the University of Mississippi, running the government's only
marijuana farm. Turner believed that marijuana was an extremely
dangerous drug--one that, among other things, might have the
power to induce homosexuality. In 1977 the DEA had acknowledged
that decriminalization was a policy worth considering; three
years later it called marijuana the most urgent drug problem
facing the United States. Richard Bonnie, a professor at the
University of Virginia Law School who was an influential member
of the Shafer Commission staff, believes that advocates of
marijuana-law reform were pushed out of the mainstream by the
growing stridency and power of the parents' groups. Political
moderates soon abandoned the issue. Amid their silence,
philosophies of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; and &quot;user
accountability&quot; revived the notion that what drug offenders
deserved most was punishment. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act
of 1984, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and the Anti-Drug Abuse
Amendment Act of 1988 raised federal penalties for marijuana
possession, cultivation, and trafficking. Sentences were to be
determined by the quantity of the drug involved;
&quot;conspiracies&quot; and &quot;attempts&quot; were to be
punished as severely as completed acts; and possession of a
hundred marijuana plants now carried the same sentence as
possession of a hundred grams of heroin. </p>

<p>The Caprice of Geography </p>

<p>Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled
substance, implying that it has a high potential for abuse, no
officially accepted medicinal uses, and no safe level of use
under medical supervision. Heroin, LSD, and peyote are other
Schedule I drugs; cocaine and phencyclidine (PCP) are listed in
Schedule II, allowing doctors to prescribe them. Under federal
law it is illegal to buy, sell, grow, or possess any amount of
marijuana anywhere in the United States. Penalties for a first
offense range from probation to life imprisonment, with fines of
up to $4 million, depending on the quantity of marijuana
involved. Moreover, it is illegal to use the U.S. Postal Service
or other interstate shippers for the advertisement, import, or
export of such marijuana paraphernalia as roach clips, water
pipes, and, in some instances, cigarette papers--a crime that can
lead to imprisonment and fines of up to $100,000. Under
civil-forfeiture statutes real estate, vehicles, cash,
securities, jewelry, and any other property connected with a
marijuana offense are subject to immediate seizure. The federal
government need not prove that the property was bought with the
proceeds of illegal drug sales, only that it was involved in the
commission of a crime--that marijuana was grown on certain land
or transported in a particular vehicle. Property may be forfeited
even after a defendant has been found innocent of the offense,
since the burden of proof that applies to people--&quot;beyond a
reasonable doubt&quot;--does not apply in accusations against
inanimate objects. Property can be forfeited without its owner's
ever being charged with a crime. On top of fines, incarceration,
and forfeiture, a convicted marijuana offender may face the
revocation or denial of more than 460 federal benefits, including
student loans, small-business loans, professional licenses, and
farm subsidies. In international smuggling cases the offender's
passport can be revoked. </p>

<p>State marijuana laws were also toughened during the 1980s and
now vary enormously. Some states classify marijuana with drugs
like mescaline and heroin, while others give it a separate legal
category. In New York state possessing slightly less than an
ounce of marijuana brings a $100 fine, rarely collected. In
Nevada possessing any amount of marijuana is a felony. In Montana
selling a pound of marijuana, first offense, could lead to a life
sentence, whereas in New Mexico selling 10,000 pounds of
marijuana, first offense, could be punished with a prison term of
no more than three years. In some states it is against the law to
be in a room where marijuana is being smoked, even if you don't
smoke any. In some states you may be subject to criminal charges
if someone else uses, distributes, or cultivates marijuana on
your property. In Idaho selling water pipes could lead to a
prison sentence of nine years. In Kentucky products made of hemp
fibers, such as paper and clothing, not only are illegal but
carry the same penalties associated with an equivalent weight of
marijuana. In Arizona, where marijuana use is forbidden, the
crime can be established by the failure of a urine test: a person
could theoretically be prosecuted in Phoenix for a joint smoked
in Philadelphia more than a week before. </p>

<p>Crossing an invisible state line with marijuana in your car
can result in vastly different punishments. If you are caught
with three ounces of marijuana in Union City, Ohio, you will
probably be fined $100. But if you are caught in the town of the
same name literally across the road in Indiana, you could face
nine months to two years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000, a
felony record, suspension of your driver's license, forfeiture of
your car, and charges of marijuana possession, of possession with
intent to distribute, and of &quot;maintaining a common
nuisance&quot; (for the criminal use of an automobile). That one
arrest in Indiana might cost you the $10,000 fine and at least
$5,000 in legal fees, plus the value of your forfeited car. Wide </p>

<p>discrepancies in punishment occur not just between states but
also from county to county within a given state. In La Salle
County, Illinois, a first-time offender arrested with 300 pounds
of marijuana might be sentenced to four months in boot camp.
Sixty-five miles to the south, in McLean County, the same person
convicted of the same crime would more likely receive a prison
sentence of four to eight years. </p>

<p>In 1992 more than 340,000 people were arrested nationwide for
violating marijuana laws. Almost three quarters of those arrests
were for simple possession, a crime that generally does not lead
to incarceration. But possession of more than an ounce--roughly
equal to the amount of tobacco in a pack of cigarettes--is in
many states a felony. Conviction may lead to a few months or a
few years behind bars and the loss of a house or a job. People
who use marijuana as medicine must either buy it from drug
dealers or grow it themselves, often in violation of the law.
James Cox, a cancer patient in St. Louis, was found guilty of
growing marijuana and sentenced to fifteen years in prison; after
the verdict both he and his wife attempted suicide. Orland
Foster, an AIDS patient in North Carolina, served fifteen months
for growing marijuana; one of his cellmates served less time for
killing a woman. Now on probation, Foster must either give up
marijuana and risk losing weight, or violate the terms of his
release and risk going back to prison. </p>

<p>In perhaps the most extraordinary case of this kind, Jim
Montgomery, a paraplegic immobilized from the waist down, who
smoked marijuana to relieve muscle spasms, was arrested in Sayre,
Oklahoma, when sheriffs found two ounces of pot in the pouch on
the back of his wheelchair. Montgomery was tried and convicted in
1992, by a jury, for possession of marijuana with intent to
distribute, for possession of paraphernalia, for unlawful
possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime (two
handguns inherited from his father, a police officer), and for
maintaining a place resorted to by users of controlled
substances. His sentence was life in prison, plus sixteen years.
Both the judge and the local prosecutor were disturbed by the
sentence chosen by the jury; the judge subsequently reduced it to
ten years. Montgomery spent ten months in a prison medical unit,
where he developed a life-threatening infection, before being
released on bond. His appeal is now pending. &quot;I'll never go
back to that prison,&quot; he says. &quot;I'd rather put a bullet
in my head.&quot; His case has already cost him more than $30,000
in legal fees. The government's effort to seize Montgomery's
home, shared with his widowed mother, proved unsuccessful. </p>

<p>Oklahoma today has a well-deserved reputation for being the
worst place in the United States to be caught with marijuana. On
June 11, 1992, Larry Jackson, a small-time crook with a lengthy
record of nonviolent offenses, was arrested at a friend's Tulsa
apartment. On the floor near Jackson's right foot a police
officer noticed a minuscule amount of marijuana--0.16 of a gram,
which is 0.005644 of an ounce. Jackson was charged with felony
possession of marijuana, convicted, and given a life sentence. In
Oklahoma City, Leland James Dodd was given two life sentences,
plus ten years, for buying fifty pounds of marijuana from
undercover officers in a &quot;reverse sting.&quot; Oklahoma is
not alone in handing out life sentences for buying marijuana from
the government. In Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, William Stephen
Bonner, a truck driver, was sent away for life without
possibility of parole after state narcotics agents delivered
forty pounds of marijuana to his bedroom. Raymond Pope, a
resident of Georgia, was lured to Baldwin County, Alabama, in
1990 with promises of cheap marijuana; he bought twenty-seven
pounds from local sheriffs in a reverse sting, was convicted, and
was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. Pope's
criminal record consisted of prior convictions for stealing
televisions and bedspreads from Georgia motels. He is now
imprisoned 400 miles from his family. He has three young
children. </p>

<p>Although the penalties for buying, selling, or possessing
marijuana are often severe, the penalties for growing it can be
even more severe. In Iowa cultivating any amount can lead to a
five-year prison sentence, in Colorado to an eight-year sentence,
in Missouri to a fifteen-year sentence. In the state of Virginia
the recommended punishment for growing a single marijuana plant
is a prison term of five to thirty years. </p>

<p>A Farm in Morgan County </p>

<p>In November of 1988 Claude Atkinson and Ernest Montgomery met
at a Denny's near the airport in Indianapolis to discuss setting
up a large-scale marijuana-growing operation. Atkinson, a
fifty-nine-year-old Indiana native, was by all accounts
charismatic and highly skilled at cultivating marijuana.
Ostensibly a used-farm-implements dealer, Atkinson had organized
huge marijuana farms in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. His
knowledge of growing techniques was much more impressive than his
skill at eluding capture. In 1984 law-enforcement authorities had
linked him to a pot farm in Paragon, Indiana; the following year
he was caught growing marijuana with artificial light in an
immense Indianapolis warehouse; and in 1987 a deer hunter
stumbled upon thousands of his marijuana plants in an Indiana
field. Claude Atkinson had cut a series of deals with the
government, informing on others after each arrest and serving
brief terms in prison, where he recruited employees for future
ventures. Now fresh out of custody and broke, he was ready to get
back into the growing business. Ernest Montgomery was an
unemployed truck driver in his early forties who wanted to make
big money. They agreed to form a partnership, with Montgomery
supplying the capital and Atkinson the expertise. Soon after
their meeting Claude Atkinson went to the Indiana statehouse and
formed a dummy corporation, R.P.Z. Investments, using one of his
many pseudonyms, Arno Zepp. </p>

<p>That fall Atkinson supervised the construction of a large
&quot;grow room&quot; in the basement of a secluded cabin that
Montgomery owned in Gosport. Montgomery enlisted his younger
brother, Jerry, a gravedigger with a slight drinking problem, to
help with the task. Together the three men drilled holes in the
concrete floor for drainage, built a cooling system, assembled
ballasts and reflectors, suspended grow lights with thousand-watt
halide bulbs from the ceiling, and planted marijuana seeds in
small pots. They installed a generator so that the operation
would not be detected through an incongruously high electric
bill. Montgomery invited David Lee Haynes, a young lumberyard
ripsaw operator from Louisville, Kentucky, and the son of an old
friend, to come live at the cabin and tend the plants. After
digging graves all day, Jerry Montgomery would visit the dark
basement in the evenings. By spring the group had approximately
12,500 seedlings of marijuana, contained in sixteen plywood
flats. What they needed next was a farm. </p>

<p>In May of 1989 Martha Brummett, an elderly woman hard of
hearing, agreed to lease her farmhouse halfway between Eminence
and Cloverdale, in Morgan County, to R.P.Z. Investments. It came
with about forty acres, a barn, and an option to buy. Martha
Brummett was surprised that when a &quot;Charlie Peters&quot;
arrived to sign the lease, the woman with him remained in the car
and never entered the house. Nevertheless, Brummett innocently
signed over her farm for $10,000 in cash, which she then took
straight to her bank. </p>

<p>A Farm in Morgan County (cont.) </p>

<p>After Ernest Montgomery and his wife, Cindy, obtained the
house, David Haynes moved into it, to babysit the operation,
having obtained a sham rental agreement from R.P.Z. Investments
as a legal buffer against what was about to happen on the land.
The group plowed and tilled the field, fertilized it, and planted
corn. Once the corn had reached a good height, they planted
marijuana, hiding it amid the stalks. Over the summer they walked
the fields, &quot;sexing&quot; the marijuana--eliminating all the
males. The females, left unpollinated, would produce a much
higher level of delta-9-THC in their buds, and would thus become
a much more valuable crop: sensimilla. In late September, before
the corn leaves turned golden, the group harvested the marijuana
and then cured it in the barn for two weeks and cut it into
&quot;books&quot; about a foot wide and three feet long. The
books were hauled into the farmhouse or driven to the cabin in
Gosport for manicuring: the stems, orphan leaves, and fan leaves
were separated from the precious buds. So far the operation had
gone smoothly. Soon there would be about 900 pounds of
high-quality marijuana to sell. Now the group needed buyers.
Ernest Montgomery thought that Mark Young, a man whom he had met
a few times with Cindy, might know the right people to call. </p>

<p>Mark Young was thirty-six and had been smoking marijuana on a
daily basis since his late teens. He grew up in Christian Park
Heights, a middle-class neighborhood on the east side of
Indianapolis. His father left the family when Mark was two; he
and his sister, Andrea, were raised by their mother, Mary, who
worked as a waitress or a hostess to pay the bills. Young was a
willful, stubborn, charming boy, always getting into trouble. He
seemed to have, throughout his pranks and petty thefts, the sort
of bad luck that is almost uncanny--often he would get caught
while his friends got away. Young dropped out of high school
after a year, became a father at the age of sixteen, married to
give the child his name, divorced, worked as a carpet-layer,
washed dishes, laid concrete, tended bar, sold used cars, and
rebuilt Harley-Davidson motorcycles. He kept an album filled with
pictures of his favorite Harleys. He knew all the local biker
gangs, but remained apart; Young seemed to get into enough
trouble on his own. He dated many attractive women, lived a fast
life, and slowly acquired a criminal record--nothing violent,
just misdemeanors for driving without a license, for possession
of marijuana, for taking a girlfriend's stereo. He also earned
two felony convictions: one at the age of twenty-one, for
attempting to pass a fraudulent prescription, and the other at
the age of twenty-five, for possession of a few amphetamines and
Quaaludes. Each felony brought a suspended sentence, probation,
and a one-dollar fine. When Ernest Montgomery called, Mark Young
was rebuilding motorcycles, selling used cars wholesale, and
looking for new income. He had held a financial interest in a
number of massage parlors, which were now closed. His dream was
to get some money, move to Florida, build custom Harleys, and
work part-time as a fishing guide on Lake Okeechobee. </p>

<p>A Farm in Morgan County-cont. </p>

<p>Claude Atkinson, Ernest Montgomery, and Mark Young met in the
family room of Young's house in early October. The price of the
marijuana was set at $1,200 a pound. If Young found buyers, he
would receive a commission of $100 for every pound sold. Not long
after, Atkinson and Montgomery returned to Young's house, where
they were introduced to two men from Florida who were acting on
behalf of someone seeking to buy all the marijuana the group
could supply. Atkinson offered a hundred pounds a week; the
marijuana was still being manicured and could not be delivered
all at once. Within days a man from New York arrived at Young's
house with $120,000 in a cardboard box. While the New York buyer
inspected the marijuana at Montgomery's Indianapolis house,
Atkinson remained behind, counting the money. The deal was
completed, and Young was handed $10,000 in cash. The New York
buyer eventually paid for 600 more pounds, in transactions that
took place at Montgomery's house. By Christmas all the
high-quality marijuana was gone, the last 200 pounds either
distributed to workers who had helped with various tasks or sold
to an acquaintance of Montgomery's in Illinois. </p>

<p>The town of Eminence, Indiana, is about twenty-five miles west
of Indianapolis. Near its only intersection is a Citizens Bank, a
small church, a convenience store, and a post office built of
concrete blocks and painted royal blue. The town boasts 180
inhabitants and looks as though it has not seen much new
construction since the interval between the world wars. There are
countless small towns like Eminence across the Midwest, slightly
faded but still eulogized as the heartland of this country. To
reach the farm used by R.P.Z. Investments, one must leave
Eminence on a narrow country road and then turn onto a dirt road
and drive for a long stretch, past fields of fifty to a hundred
acres where corn, hay, soybeans, and wheat are grown, past modest
farms with collapsing outbuildings, an occasional trailer home,
and rusted cars on cinder blocks. Farther west the land is flat,
the acreage of each plot enormous, but here the countryside feels
long settled, with hedges and trees marking boundary lines. After
cleaning out the barn, Atkinson and Montgomery allowed the lease
on Martha Brummett's property to expire. The one-story farmhouse
has been painted beige by its latest occupants; the barn remains
bright red. There is a porch on the front of the house, an
enclosed patio on one side, and a swing set on the lawn. Looking
at this humble farm, one would hardly believe that more than a
million dollars' worth of marijuana had been grown there in the
space of about three months. </p>

<p>Inside The Industry </p>

<p>Steve White looks like an ordinary Indiana farmer, with
slightly unkempt hair, a graying beard, teeth stained by
nicotine, and strong hands. The day we met, he wore an old
flannel shirt, gray pants, and battered work boots. His voice has
a low rural twang. He seems to belong in an old pickup, riding
through a vast dusty field. White is the Indiana coordinator for
the Drug Enforcement Administration's Cannabis
Eradication/Suppression Program. Of his twenty-six years in
federal law enforcement, twenty-one have been spent in Indiana,
working undercover. He knows the state backwards and
forwards--has walked it, driven it, and flown low over it every
summer, scrutinizing hills and farmland. Nobody ever thinks he is
a cop. He gets along well with rural people. He grew up in New
York City and attended P.S. 20; his father worked on Wall Street.
He travels to London each year to indulge a passion for
collecting English antique toy soldiers. Special Agent White
would be an implausible character in any work of fiction. Savvy,
articulate, self-deprecating, and blunt, he defies easy
categorization and probably knows more about growing marijuana
than most of the people he arrests. </p>

<p>Claude Atkinson was an extremely talented grower with a
&quot;good product,&quot; White says--and &quot;a super
salesman.&quot; The operation near Eminence was of average size
for its time. It is difficult, even from the air, to find
marijuana hidden in corn: &quot;Remember North by
Northwest?&quot; White says. &quot;Cary Grant in the cornfield?
We don't have cornfields like that anymore, with wide rows. They
broadcast the stuff, and it's just thicker than hell.&quot;
Sometimes patches of marijuana will be distributed here and there
amid hundreds of acres. Discovering one may not lead to the
others. Growers tend to be much more concerned about hiding their
marijuana from thieves than from the government. A rural
underworld has emerged around marijuana, secretive and unknown to
outsiders; booby traps are laid in cornfields. There is now a
group of people in the Marijuana Belt, known as &quot;patch
pirates,&quot; who earn a living solely by stealing marijuana
from growers, whom they follow. White acknowledges that the booby
traps are usually aimed at patch pirates, not his own men;
nevertheless, fishhooks strung at eye level on fishing line are
nondiscriminatory. Outdoor marijuana farms have become smaller in
the past few years, though last summer White's agents found
&quot;60,000 beautiful plants&quot; on a farm in Tippecanoe
County. The case proved a disappointment: the DEA never found the
grower. &quot;What I want is bodies,&quot; White explains.
&quot;I don't give a damn about the dope--that's just something
we're going to burn up.&quot; His job involves a daily
cat-and-mouse pursuit of marijuana growers, with both sides
changing tactics, adopting new technologies, and often, after an
arrest, amicably discussing tricks of the trade. White harbors no
animosity toward his prey. &quot;These are not heroin or cocaine
dealers,&quot; he says. &quot;They're not violent. I find a lot
of them personally engaging.&quot; What they are doing is against
the law, however, and White loves tracking them down. He has had
a good deal of success lately. In 1992 Indiana led the nation in
federal arrests for marijuana. Last year it ranked third. <br>

<p>Take a map of the United States and draw a circle, including
within its circumference Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, with
portions of Ohio to the east, Kentucky and Tennessee to the
south, and Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska to the west. The region
within that circle, Steve White believes, is producing the
majority of the marijuana grown in the United States. The
highest-quality marijuana is cultivated indoors on the West
Coast, but for sheer volume, no other area surpasses the U.S.
heartland. White does not find this surprising. During the Second
World War the U.S. government encouraged farmers throughout the
Corn Belt to plant almost 300,000 acres of marijuana, in the
hopes of replacing fiber supplies from Asia which had been cut
off by the Japanese. The program, whose slogan was &quot;Hemp for
Victory,&quot; turned out to be a financial disaster and left
marijuana growing wild throughout the region. Known as ditchweed,
this marijuana now blankets tens of thousands of acres. For years
it had a negligible delta-9-THC content, and was used mainly as
filler by drug dealers, but there is evidence that the ditchweed
may be cross-pollinating with the potent marijuana now cultivated
outdoors. The same growing conditions and soil that are ideal for
corn are also ideal for marijuana. Most local sheriff's
departments employ only three to five officers, with more
important things to do than hunt for marijuana. And over the past
fifteen years there have been a lot of people with strong
agricultural skills who have badly needed money--or have wanted
more of it than almost any other job in the region could provide.
A bushel of corn sells for roughly $2.50, a bushel of manicured
marijuana for about $70,000. White thinks that marijuana is the
largest cash crop in the United States, and if not the largest in
Indiana, then right up there with corn and soybeans. Though he is
proud of what his office has accomplished, White has no
illusions: &quot;There's more than we think.&quot; </p>

<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s nearly all the marijuana
smoked in the United States was imported, mainly from Mexico,
Colombia, and Jamaica. Domestic production rose in reaction to a
number of events. The spraying of an herbicide, paraquat, over
Mexican marijuana fields, begun in 1975, created uneasiness about
that nation's product. Successful interdiction efforts by the
U.S. Border Patrol and the Coast Guard made smuggling marijuana
more difficult. And the tougher legal sanctions against
trafficking led some foreign drug dealers to switch from
marijuana, a bulk agricultural good with a strong smell, to
cocaine, which is easier to conceal and brings a far higher
return per pound. As marijuana prices rose, American growers
responded to consumer demand. Mark A.R. Kleiman, an associate
professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government,
finds this to be a rare instance in which protectionism actually
worked. The anti-drug movement and the burgeoning American
marijuana crop led the DEA to devote more of its resources to
marijuana investigations. Kleiman estimates that by 1988 federal
anti-marijuana efforts totaled approximately $970 million--about
20 to 25 percent of all federal drug-enforcement expenditures. By
1992 federal convictions for marijuana outnumbered those for
heroin, crack cocaine, and LSD combined. The DEA's Cannabis
Eradication/Suppression Program began in 1979 in two states,
California and Hawaii; it now looks for marijuana-farming
operations--called &quot;grows&quot; or &quot;gardens&quot; by
members of the trade--in all fifty states. </p>

<p>Inside The Industry--cont. </p>

<p>No one knows exactly how much marijuana is cultivated in the
United States. The numbers published by the government--or anyone
else--are largely speculative. In 1992 the DEA eradicated 3,405
metric tons of cultivated marijuana in the United States, an
amount the DEA says represents more than half the total domestic
output. Critics believe that the DEA actually finds only 10 to 20
percent of the marijuana being grown in this country. With prices
ranging from $500 a pound, for low-quality New Mexican marijuana,
to more than $5,000 a pound for &quot;boutique&quot; strains like
Northern Lights and Afghan Kush, it can be confidently stated
that the black market for American marijuana, whatever the actual
tonnage, is immense. </p>

<p>Growers are increasingly moving their crops indoors, using
artificial light and hydroponics, to avoid theft, reduce the risk
of detection, control the growing process, and profit from up to
six harvests a year. Thirty mature plants can easily be grown in
an area the size of a bathtub. I asked Steve White to list some
of the places where he has discovered indoor grow operations. He
laughed. &quot;It would be tough for me to say places we haven't
found them.&quot; Often a false wall hides a grow room in a
house, or a house's foundation doesn't match its basement, which
seems oddly smaller, or there are second stories with no
stairwells, or crawl spaces are hidden beneath floors. Once White
rummaged through a child's closet and found the entrance to a
grow area behind the toys. Without need of a search warrant, the
DEA employs thermal-imaging devices, mounted on helicopters and
low-flying airplanes, to detect abnormal heat sources that may
indicate the presence of an indoor growing operation--or a
pottery kiln, or a Jacuzzi. What is found depends upon the skill
of the technician. White has learned that one of the best ways to
find an indoor grow area is with his nose: no matter how
well-vented the operation, and despite electronic devices that
can neutralize odors in the air, marijuana will exude a powerful
scent. A few years ago indoor grows were often huge. A group of
janitors in Anderson, Indiana, who had traveled to Israel to
study hydroponics, were caught with 8,100 plants in a building
with walls constructed a foot thick to thwart infrared detection.
Nowadays growers rent storage units and apartments, using phony
names and paying in cash, and build small grow operations at
different locations, with timing devices and automatic controls.
The authorities may find one or two--a loss anticipated in the
grower's business plan--without being able to trace ownership. </p>

<p>White has smoked marijuana once, while working undercover, and
did not enjoy the experience. He chain-smokes cigarettes, regrets
it, and sees no need to add marijuana to the nation's list of
legal drugs. &quot;We've got tobacco, we've got alcohol,&quot; he
said. &quot;Jesus Christ, do we need another hallucinogenic,
carcinogenic substance on the market?&quot; What disturbs him
most about marijuana is the phenomenal sums of money it funnels
into an underground economy, and the great resulting potential
for corruption among public officials. I asked whether a sense of
futility ever creeps into his work, given the extent of
cultivation in his state. &quot;I'm not such a fool as to sit
here and tell you that we're going to wipe out marijuana,&quot;
he replied. But there is no doubt in his mind that the DEA exerts
a deterrent effect. &quot;Every time we have a helicopter go up
on a mission,&quot; White said, &quot;there's someone down below
who sees it and thinks, 'Maybe I better not.'&quot; </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>Originally published in Atlantic Monthly, August 1994 issue. </p>

<p>Inside The Industry--cont. </p>

<p>Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice at Illinois
State University, does not know Steve White but has come to many
of the same conclusions about marijuana cultivation in the
Midwest. Weisheit first became interested in the subject eight
years ago, when he saw, on the television news, an old Illinois
farmer being arrested for cultivating marijuana. The farmer and
his son never smoked marijuana; they grew it to save their farm
from foreclosure. Weisheit was intrigued. With a grant from the
research arm of the U.S. Justice Department, he conducted a
two-year study of marijuana cultivation, interviewing
law-enforcement officials in five states and dozens of Illinois
growers who had been caught and convicted. The book based on that
study, Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry (1992),
chronicles the rise of marijuana production in the United States
and offers a fascinating portrait of the growers. Weisheit agrees
that the majority of marijuana grown in America probably
originates in the nine-state region described by Steve White. He
also thinks that marijuana is the nation's largest cash crop, by
a very wide margin. </p>

<p>Estimates of how many Americans grow marijuana range from one
to three million, of which anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 are
commercial growers. Weisheit found that aside from being
predominantly white and male, marijuana growers generally do not
fit any common stereotypes. Some are pragmatists, growing the
drug purely for the money; during the farm crisis of the 1980s
many farmers in the Marijuana Belt started cultivating marijuana
out of desperation. They found it not only easy money but also
easy work. As one farmer told Weisheit, &quot;You know, I spent
most of my life trying to kill weeds, so trying to keep one alive
was hardly a challenge.&quot; Other growers are hustlers by
nature, classic American entrepreneurs; they might as well be
selling time-shares in a vacation condominium. They try to build
marijuana empires. The risks of the trade only add to its appeal.
Other growers are less competitive, giving away marijuana to
friends or selling it at slightly above cost, sharing
agricultural techniques, comparing their crops the way neighbors
might compare homegrown tomatoes. Marijuana growers are educated
and uneducated, liberal and conservative. They are extremely
secretive, worrying more about thieves than about the police. Few
belong to NORML (the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws) and few read High Times magazine or add their
names to any list that might arouse suspicion. Indoor growing
often attracts people who love gizmos. There are endless
contraptions that can be added to a grow room, from
computer-controlled watering systems to electric tables that
distribute nutrients evenly by tilting back and forth. Some
growers become connoisseurs, producing high-quality marijuana in
small quantities, manipulating not only the level of delta-9-THC
through cross-breeding but also the proportions of all the other
cannabinoids to subtly--or not so subtly--affect the nature of
the high. Weisheit met growers and law-enforcement officers alike
who were extraordinarily passionate about marijuana, eager to
discuss its arcane details for hours. He was surprised, after the
publication of his book, by how little controversy it generated
in either camp. His mother was disturbed, however, by one of its
central implications: &quot;She's very anti-drug,&quot; Weisheit
says, &quot;and her comment was, 'The thing I don't like about
this book is that it makes these people seem so normal.'&quot; </p>

marijuana on and off for more than a decade, beginning outdoors
and graduating to a series of increasingly complex indoor grow
systems. Understandably paranoid and suspicious, Dave is also
quite proud of his work and regrets being unable to discuss it
with friends. His grow operation had to be built surreptitiously,
over a period of weeks, like a factory assembled by hand. It
utilizes about $50,000 worth of high-tech hydroponic equipment.
When the construction was complete, the whole thing looked so
beautiful that Dave wanted to throw an opening-night party, but
he decided that would not be a good idea. Though he always hated
gardening and never passed a science class in his life, he now
has a grasp of marijuana botany, plant biology, and advanced
greenhouse-management techniques which only Special Agent White
could fully appreciate. As he smoked some of his most recent
harvest, Dave shared with me some of the pleasures, risks,
rewards, and bizarre phenomena associated with his profession. </p>

<p>Hidden behind a fake wall, entered through a secret door, in a
neighborhood where you would never, ever, expect to find it,
Dave's operation is much larger than most. There are hundreds of
marijuana plants in long rows, growing from cubes of rock wool, a
soil-less medium spun from synthetic fibers, connected through an
intricate system of white plastic pipes. Suspended above them are
extremely bright high-pressure sodium lights, which require a
surge of power from special ballasts to start up. On the ceiling
is the bluish flame of a carbon-dioxide generator burning natural
gas. The windows have been sealed and blacked out. The room is
quite warm, the air thick and humid, the whole place filled with
a pungent smell reminiscent of fresh hay. Like a greenhouse
without glass, it feels very still and quiet, except for the
sound of water rushing through narrow pipes. </p>

<p>When everything is running smoothly, Dave controls the
elements necessary for his plants: air, light, heat, and water.
In a closed chamber there is no wind; here a ventilation system
provides it, circulating air rich in carbon dioxide. When outdoor
temperatures drop too low, Dave uses the CO2 generator on the
ceiling--in effect &quot;fertilizing the air.&quot; Pumps and
timers automatically water the plants, also delivering nutrients
such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which would normally
be derived from soil. One of the critical factors in growing
marijuana is the proportion of darkness to light. Sometimes
Dave's high-pressure sodium lights burn eighteen hours a day,
raising the temperature in the grow room to as high as 110
degrees. During the female plant's reproductive stage there must
be long periods of total, uninterrupted darkness. As little as
two footcandles of light can disrupt the delicate process by
which delta-9-THC accumulates in the buds. Turning on a
flashlight at the wrong moment, Dave says, is enough to ruin his
plants. </p>

<p>He is truly a connoisseur, growing an expensive strain of
marijuana from the northern Hindu Kush. As he describes how some
outdoor growers stuff marijuana into plastic garbage bags while
it is still wet, he grimaces, like a master vintner appalled by
the improper handling of grapes. The buds are very fragile, he
says: &quot;You're trying to coax this mature flower to retain
its essence--and then store it and seal it at that instant in
time.&quot; His finished product is deep green and aromatic, like
some rare, exotic spice. </p>

<p>Inside The Industry--cont. </p>

<p>Growing marijuana indoors requires much more work than
cultivating it outdoors. There is also more potential for
disaster. A splash of liquid on a hot light will cause it to
explode. A broken pipe can flood the room with hundreds of
gallons of water. A power outage shuts the whole system down. The
nutrient solution, if improperly monitored, can quickly turn too
acidic and, as Dave puts it, &quot;give the plants a heart
attack.&quot; More common, and yet somehow more surreal, are
insect infestations that can harm valuable young plants. Dave has
battled spider mites, greenhouse whiteflies, and aphids.
Insecticides are not an option in an enclosed room, with a crop
that will be smoked. Dave uses biological controls, unleashing
hungry young predators upon unwanted bugs. Recently he released
thousands of miniature wasps. This is insanity, he thought; but
it worked. Inside a nearby refrigerator he always keeps 500
ladybug eggs, next to the soda, in case of an emergency. At the
moment Dave is contending with gnats, who leave his plants alone
but swarm and bite him as he walks about the grow room in the
dark. </p>

<p>Someone At The Door </p>

<p>On March 18, 1990, a pair of deputy sheriffs in Johnson
County, Indiana, spotted a red Jeep being driven erratically and
signaled for its driver to pull off the road. Behind the wheel
they found Jerry Montgomery, obviously intoxicated; littering the
truck were three empty vodka bottles, a five-gallon bucket full
of marijuana, and a gray box containing more than $13,000 in
cash. After obtaining a warrant, sheriffs searched Montgomery's
house, finding more marijuana and a locked briefcase hidden under
his bed. Deputy John Myers pried it open with a screwdriver. In
the briefcase were receipts for farm equipment; documents
mentioning R.P.Z. Investments, Claude Atkinson, and Ernest
Montgomery; an option to buy a property owned by Martha Brummett;
and a number of books suggesting that this arrest was the
beginning, not the end, of a trail: Indoor Marijuana
Horticulture, The Primo Plant, and How to Grow Marijuana Indoors
Under Lights. </p>

<p>The investigation eventually led authorities to a 500-acre
farm close to Solsberry, in Greene County, owned by Arno Zepp, of
Investment Holdings, Inc. On August 22 federal, state, and local
law-enforcement agents arrested Claude Atkinson, raided the farm,
and, with the help of volunteers from the Indiana National Guard,
destroyed 10,000 marijuana plants. Atkinson soon began to talk.
In May of 1991 Ernest Montgomery was arrested at his Gosport
cabin, where 7,000 marijuana seedlings sat in little pots, ready
for planting. Early that same morning Mark Young was awakened by
someone at the front door. Unlike his former business associates,
Young was not growing anything. He and his girlfriend, Patricia,
were in the process of moving to Florida. When he saw a man with
a badge and a gun, Young had no idea what was happening, but
assumed that it must have something to do with unpaid taxes. </p>

<p><b>REEFER MADNESS -- Finale</b> </p>

<p>REEFER MADNESS by Eric Schlosser </p>

<p>More than a dozen law-enforcement officers surrounded the
house. Their commander, a DEA agent, treated Young politely,
allowing him to get dressed and agreeing not to handcuff him in
front of the neighbors. At the station Young read his indictment.
He was being charged, under federal law, not only for his role in
distributing 700 pounds of marijuana but also for conspiring to
manufacture all 12,500 marijuana plants grown on Martha
Brummett's farm. Young was unaware of the punishment he might
face until later that day. John Hollywood, a bail bondsman in
Indianapolis, arrived in the afternoon to secure his release. But
the government refused to set bail. Under Indiana's strict state
law, the same charges would bring a maximum sentence of
twenty-eight years--at most, fourteen years served in prison, and
probably much less. But under federal law Young's two prior state
felony convictions, one of them more than seventeen years old,
classified him as a career drug offender. This arrest could prove
his third strike. At the U.S. attorney's discretion, he faced a
possible mandatory-minimum sentence of life imprisonment without
possibility of parole. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #76- A True Story </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-04 11:19:51 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>This next series of posts will be a sad, but true story. It's
not near as long as the Atlantic Monthly article. </p>

<p>From: delisle@eskimo.com (Ben Delisle) </p>

<p>Date: Thu, 27 May 1993 05:19:52 GMT </p>

<p>[Forwarded] </p>

<p><b>&quot;Justice Goes To Pot&quot;</b> </p>

<p><b>by B. J. Oppenheimer</b> </p>

<p>As you read this, I'll probably be behind bars, serving a
possible five to 40 years in federal prison with no hope of
parole. My house will have been confiscated by the government,
and a fine of $340,000 will have been levied against me. </p>

<p>I'm a nonviolent offender with no prior record. Married for 20
years with two small children, I'm a college graduate and
published writer. I have a good reputation in the community and
have been involved in many charitable organizations. My only
crime was planting a handful of marijuana seeds... </p>

<p>When I was first arrested for growing pot last August, I
freely admitted my guilt, fully expecting to receive the
relatively minor sentence usually meted out in marijuana cases.
Until recently, marijuana use and cultivation was decriminalized
in many places, and even now it's only a misdemeanor in most
states (including my own). It usually warrants nothing more than
a suspended sentence and a small fine when prosecuted at the
state level. Last year a man in Upstate New York was convicted of
growing 154 plants - many more than I am charged with - and his
only punishment was a $100 fine - less than a dollar a plant. </p>

<p>My penalty probably would have been similar - if I'd been
tried in state court. But more and more, these cases are being
turned over to the federal government for prosecution, where
penalties are much stiffer. What would've earned me, at most, a
fine and probation in state court carries a mandatory minimum
sentence of five years (and a maximum of 40) when prosecuted at
the federal level. </p>

<p>It's all because of recently enacted mandatory
minimum-sentencing laws. They impose statutory minimums for all
drug crimes and prohibit the judge from any exercise of judicial
discretion in arriving at a sentence. The judge is enjoined
against taking into account things like my reputation in the
community, charitable works, or lack of prior record. Since
there's no such thing as parole in federal prison anymore, if I'm
sentenced to five years (assuming I lose my case), that's how
many I'll serve. </p>

<p>Chalk it up to the government's &quot;get tough on crime&quot;
policy: So what if a few undeserving people serve inflated
sentences? It's worth it to keep the streets free from crime. The
problem is, rather on being tough on crime, the net effect of
mandatory minimums is to be soft on crime - violent crime. Since
the are no mandatory minimum sentences for offenses like rape,
child molestation, murder, aggravated assault, et cetera, violent
criminals are often released early to make room for nonviolent
first offenders like me. The average murderer now serves only six
and a half years in jail (versus the five years minimum I'll
serve). But if our jail terms are similar, there's one important
difference between the murderer and me: He doesn't lose his
house. </p>

<p>Even though my house was bought with legitimate earnings, and
there was no marijuana grown on my property, it was confiscated
by the police shortly after I was arrested. The primary reason
given was that fertilizer was found in my basement. My house was
thus considered a &quot;facilitator&quot; of the crime, which
justifies its forfeiture. When I learned that the government had
seized my property on such flimsy pretenses, it infuriated me,
but what bothered me even more was that they did it without even
trying me first. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #77- A True Story-2 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-05 10:34:53 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Part 2. of the sad story </p>

<p>From: delisle@eskimo.com (Ben Delisle) </p>

<p>Date: Thu, 27 May 1993 05:19:52 GMT </p>

<p><b>[Forwarded]</b> </p>

<p><b>&quot;Justice Goes To Pot&quot;</b> </p>

<p><b>by B. J. Oppenheimer</b> </p>

<p>Since passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984,
property can be seized if one is merely suspected of using it in
a crime. It's not even necessary to be charged, much less
convicted. It's up to the individual to prove that he didn't use
it illegally. And since this is a civil forfeiture, and public
defenders are only provided in criminal cases, he's forced to
foot the bill for a lawyer. Often he also must put up a bond,
sometimes as much as $10,000, which usually makes fighting the
forfeiture cost-prohibitive. </p>

<p>In the majority of cases, the government simply steps in and
takes the property without even bothering to charge anyone with a
crime, and there's not a thing to be done about it. Since 1984
almost two and a half billion dollars in property has been seized
this way. There's another difference between the murderer and me.
He isn't subject to penalties for tax-stamp violation. Even
though marijuana is illegal, in many states you're required by
law to buy tax stamps for its cultivation - at a cost of $1,000
per plant - something that's virtually impossible to do without
incriminating yourself. Yet even if you are somehow able to
purchase the stamps without getting arrested but don't actually
affix the stamps to the plants - in the wind and rain - you're
still liable for a heavy fine. And they don't just count the
living, growing plants. They count the dead ones and even the
cutoff stems from plants that were thinned from the garden and
thrown away earlier. </p>

<p>Even though the total weight of marijuana in my case was under
five pounds, with all these other factors added in, the fine was
$340,000. When I asked my lawyer how the government expected me
to pay such an astronomical fine, he said, &quot;They don't. They
want to wipe out your assets. Then when - and if - you get out of
jail, they intend to garnish your wages for the remainder. Of
course, by that time there'll be all that interest....&quot; </p>

<p>But the fine is just part of my penalty for tax-stamp
violation. It also carries criminal (versus civil) penalties of
up to five years in state prison. That's on top of the five to 40
years I'll already be serving in </p>

<p>federal prison. All for the crime of putting a handful of
marijuana seeds in the ground. If this seems like a violation of
the Eighth Amendment (&quot;Let the punishment fit the
crime&quot;), it's not the only time the Constitution's been
ignored when it comes to drug law. Confiscation of property
without due process is a violation of the Fifth Amendment. Police
can now obtain search warrants based on anonymous tips, which is
a violation of the Fourth Amendment. And a defense attorney's
legal fees can be seized in drug cases, a violation of the Sixth
Amendment. </p>

<p>But if drug laws are chipping away at the Constitution,
they're wreaking havoc on our prison system. Federal prisons are
currently at 146 percent of capacity, and drug offenders serving
mandatory minimum sentences make up 57 percent of the population
(more than half had no prior arrests). At the current rate of
incarceration, nearly 70 percent of all federal inmates will be
drug offenders serving mandatory minimums by 1995. </p>

<p>The United States now imprisons more of its citizens per
capita than any other country in the world (455 per 100,000
people). That's compared to the No. 2 country, South Africa, with
311 per 100,000. As stated earlier, violent offenders often must
be granted early release to make room for this influx. In a
recent four-year period in Florida more than 130,000 inmates
(including muggers, armed robbers, et cetera) were released, and
one out of three went on to commit new crimes. The F.B.I. reports
that the rate of violent crimes in America increased by 24
percent from 1987 to 1991, and many people feel that mandatory
minimums have a lot to do with it. </p>

<p><b>&quot;Justice Goes To Pot&quot;</b> </p>

<p><b>by B. J. Oppenheimer</b> </p>

<p>But apart from the hypothetical increase in violent crime due
to mandatory minimums, there's the undeniable increase in
taxpayer costs. The National Institute of Corrections estimates
that in 1992, the United States built facilities for 2,000 cells
(at a cost of $100 million) per week to accommodate the exploding
prison population - and construction costs were only a part of
the total. It's been estimated that in five years, the financial
obligations incurred by U.S. corrections could be double the
current national deficit. On top of that, it costs on average
over $20,000 a year to house, feed, clothe, and guard each of the
81,426 federal prisoners. </p>

<p>And this is to say nothing of the increased cost of social
services of inmates' families, which were previously being
provided for by the inmates themselves. Over 30 million Americans
regularly smoke marijuana, so it's not surprising that a lot of
people in this country feel that it should be decriminalized. I'm
sure that many people would disagree, but I doubt they'd dispute
the fact that the penalties for marijuana use are not only unjust
and illogical, but make an unconscionable waste of taxpayer
dollars. With violent crime making us all live like prisoners,
it's time to stop freeing murders to make room for marijuana
users. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #79- G. Washington </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-07 10:53:57 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Way to go ABC!!. A very good show. I thought it might be
appropriate to go back to the Father of Our Country for this
post. Looks like old George may not have grown all of his hemp
for fiber. ;-) </p>

<p>From _Licit &amp; Illicit Drugs_, by Consumer Reports, p. 403:
</p>

<p>...In 1762, &quot;Virginia awarded bounties for hempculture
and manufacture, and imposed penalties upon those who did not
produce it.&quot; </p>

<p>George Washington was growing hemp at Mount Vernon three years
later--presumably for its fiber, though it has been argued that
Washington was also concerned to increase the medicinal or
intoxicating potency of his marijuana plants.* </p>

<p>The asterisk footnote: </p>

<p>* The argument depends on a curious tradition, which may or
may not be sound, that the quality or quantity of marijuana resin
(hashish) is enhanced if the male and female plants are separated
*before* the females are pollinated. There can be no doubt that
Washington separated the males and the females. Two entries in
his diary supply the evidence: </p>

<p>May 12-13 1765: &quot;Sowed Hemp at Muddy hole by Swamp.&quot;
</p>

<p>August 7, 1765: &quot;--began to seperate (sic) the Male from
the Female Hemp at Do--rather too late.&quot; </p>

<p>George Andrews has argued, in _The Book of Grass: An Anthology
of Indian Hemp_ (1967), that Washington's August 7 diary entry
&quot;clearly indiactes that he was cultivating the plant for
medicinal purposes as well for its fiber.&quot; [7] He might have
separated the males from the females to get better fiber, Andrew
concedes--but his phrase &quot;rather too late&quot; suggests
that he wanted to complete the separation *before the female
plants were fertilized*--and this was a practice related to drug
potency rather that to fiber culture. </p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>That's all for today. A nice short one parter. I might go out
of town this weekend and if so, I'll be back Monday. Same hemp
time...Same hemp station.. </p>

talk, especially in the ABC news area. Had a wonderful trip to
Austin. The fields all looked like they were painted blue , red

<p>Here's an old standby I've had saved for a time when I didn't
have time to search the net for more useful info. </p>

</p>

<p><b>Part 1.</b> </p>

<p><b>From &quot;Dennis Miller Live&quot; on HBO, Friday, Nov.
11, 1994, 10:00 pm</b> </p>

<p><b>[ After joking about recent DC Mayoral elect Marion Barry]</b>
</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe he deserves a second chance, I mean who did he
really hurt besides himself? Maybe it's time that we as a nation
start staying out of people's personal problems and vices. What
are we doing spending billions of dollars trying to keep people's
private lives in order? And I'm talking about legal age
consenting adults here, not kids, we obviously have to take
special precautions to protect kids. But what is this Orwellian
hang-up of ours of sticking our nose into other grown-up's
affairs? What concern is it of ours if some mindless stoner wants
to spend his his life hooked up to a Turkish skull bong? Now, I'm
not pro-drug, they obviously cause a lot of damage, but I am
pro-logic and you're never going to stop the human need for
release through altered consciousness. The government can take
away all the drugs in the world and people will just spin around
on their lawn until they fell down and saw God. </p>

<p>&quot;Now I don't want to get off on a rant here, but it seems
to really enrage the vast cheese dog and beer quaffing nation out
there when someone decides to waste his own life chasing down
chemical euphoria and I'm not sure why. Our displeasure with
someone hell-bent on self-ruination through drug use seems really
disproportionate to its direct impact on us. And as a matter of
fact, I believe we amplify that impact when we attempt to enforce
unenforceable laws. It not only costs us billions of dollars, but
it puts us in harms way as addicts are driven to crime as a means
to an end. Why do we chase druggies down like villagers after
Karlov? Let them legally have what they already have and defuse
the bomb. You know, I think the hysteria about drugs is often
times baseless. And this comes from me, a man who has never done
cocaine in his life, although I did smoke dope upon occasion
during my stint as a student at Oxford in the late 60s. And you
know, the war on drugs is more often than not fruitless and
patently hypocritical, be honest with yourselves now. What drugs
are the most dangerous to the most Americans? Its a no brainer:
cigarettes and alcohol. Those are the statistical champions by
hundreds of thousands of deaths. And wouldn't you rather shoot a
game of pool with a guy smoking a joint than a guy drinking
whisky and beer? </p>

<p>Someone smoking a joint doesn't all of the sudden rear back
and stab his partner in the eye socket with a cue stick, ok? He's
too busy laughing at the balls. </p>

<p>&quot;And you know as far as harder drugs go, if somebody
wants to shoot up and die right in front of you, more power to
him, you know? It's his call. And you know the herd always has a
way of thinning itself out. We aren't stupid people here in
America, no more than anyone else in the world, so why are we
obsessing on habits that harm no one but the habitual, while we
let real problems slip ever further out of reach. We seem to be
willfully turning away from reality, and from logic might I add,
to punish people, who in many instances are doing an extremely
fine job of punishing themselves, thank you. And in some cases
they're not even punishing themselves, but rather just following
age old spawning instincts that are as woven as deeply into their
brain as their need to watch Home Improvement. <br>

<p>&quot;Is their anything more fruitless than trying to
legislate sexual behavior? You know according to the law, you
can't even get a blow job in Georgia? No wonder Sherman hustled
through there. And really if you stop to think about it, who is
hurt by the time honored unavoidable trade of prostitution? Only
the guys who pay extra to be hurt. There is no sane reason to
cling to this archaic legal attempt to curtail an activity that
will be around until the end of time. You know, you could come
back to this planet ten thousand years from now and man could
have evolved to the point where he doesn't even take in nutrition
from a hole in head anymore, but I guarantee you that he'll still
be cruising ninth avenue trying to get a knob-shine from somebody
named Desiree. </p>

<p>&quot;What sort of perfect harried experiment society are we
striving for folks? One where you will be forced by the
puritanical mentality of your pin-headed Gladys Kravitz neighbors
into a tightly constricted, over-regimented existence? A life
safe from the temptations and rewards of the flesh? If that's
your kink - go for it. But for the rest of us, let's save the
money we're wasting trying to regulate other people's private
lives. If an individual wants to smoke a joint, or shoot up, or
munch blotter like tic-tacs and drop out, let them. All right?
Let's put the billions we're wasting on a drug war, fought by
fitness fanatics on steroids and three-martini senators rolling
in pork, let's put it back in the educational system. Let's free
the courts and jails of lonely men and broken women who feel the
need to buy and sell sex. Let's let hookers and their johns have
a safe building somewhere off the streets, inspected medically
and taxed up the wazoo. Let's go on from there to tax liquor and
cigarettes so that those industries can pay for safe one-lane
drunk-proof highways and air purification systems. Most
importantly, let's stop retending that people are going to lead
the lives that we tell them to lead. Let's stop pretending that a
few simple prohibitions on substances and activities will yield
up a nation of Beaver Cleavers: polite, clean, sexless, and ready
to serve their fellow man, no questions asked. People are people.
They're going to with their lives what they want to do, whether
you like it or not. There is nothing you can do about them that
won't break the bank, overcrowd the prisons, or corrode an
already oxidized judicial system. </p>

<p>People are perennially going to get f***** up and f***, and we
will continue to get f***** over if we don't concede the fact
that there is absolutely f***-all we can do about it. </p>

<p>&quot;Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be
wrong.&quot; </p>

<p><b>SURPRISE ! HORROR STORIES OF DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE DON'T
HOLD UP</b> </p>

<p><b>By David Morris</b> </p>

<p><b>St. Paul Minnesota</b> </p>

<p>It has been a while since drugs made the front page. So let me
bring you up to date on recent findings about drug use that
didn't make it to prime-time news. </p>

<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that the giant
utility Utah Power and Light, &quot;spent $215 per employee per
year less on the drug abusers in health insurance benefits than
on the control group.&quot; Employees that tested positive for
drugs at Georgia Power Company had a higher promotion rate than
the company average. Workers testing positive only for Marijuana
exhibited absenteeism some 30 percent lower than average. </p>

<p>Scientific American, after exhaustive research, found that the
studies usually cited to prove the dangers of drug use in the
workplace were either shoddy or misinterpreted. Astonishingly,
the magazine could identify only one study on workplace drug use
that has passed through the standard peer review process for
scientific evaluation. </p>

<p>That one, published in the Journal of General Internal
Medicine, studied 180 hospital employees, 22 of whom had tested
positive after being hired. It found &quot;no difference between
drug-positive and drug-negative employees&quot; with respect to
supervisor valuations or performance. Except for one intriguing
item: </p>

<p>Eleven of the negatives had been fired during their first year
on the job, but none of the positives. </p>

<p>More recently the American Psychologist, a peer-reviewed
scientific journal, reported on a 15 year study of the San
Francisco-area children by researchers Jonathan Shedler and Jack
Block of the University of California at Berkley. </p>

<p>Their report reveals that adolescents who occasionally use
drugs are healthier than both drug abusers and drug abstainers.
Moreover, those who abuse drugs as teen-agers have distinct
behavioral problems that were identifiable years before there
drug use began. Drug use is a symptom, not a cause. </p>

<p>Says Mr. Shedler, &quot;the most effective drug prevention
programs might not deal with drugs at all.&quot; </p>

<p>In an interview published in the National Review, Michael S.
Gazzaniga, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School,
discussed several studies that found that drug use increases in
groups under stress, but that &quot;the rate of addiction doesn't
go up no matter what the degree of stress. Most people can walk
away from high drug use if their lives become more normal.&quot; </p>

<p>The British journal New Scientist reports research that found
the majority of those who become dependant on Cocaine return to
moderate use or total abstinence without treatment. </p>

<p>Finally, Florida State University conducted a study for the
Florida legislature of 45,096 people arrested for drug possesion
in 1987. Eighty-eight percent had never been arrested for
property crimes like burglary. Says professor David Rasmussen,
&quot;this study suggests we are incarcerating people for the use
of drugs when they do not commit other crimes and tend not to
commit other crimes.&quot; </p>

<p>What are we to conclude ? </p>

<p>Relying on these and many other studies, the Washington-based
Drug Policy Foundation, a beacon of reason in a sea of hysteria,
offers the following framework. Stress causes drug use. The vast
majority of those who use drugs are casual users. Those who use
drugs tend not to commit other crimes. Drugs in the workplace are
not a serious burden on productivity. </p>

<p>Which isn't to say there is no problem. There is. But it's a
problem caused more by making drug use a crime than by the use
itself. </p>

<p><b>By David Morris</b> </p>

<p><b>St. Paul Minnesota</b> </p>

<p>&quot;There is little argument that drug trafficking has
played crucial role in spawning the rise of violent crime,&quot;
the Washington Post recently observed. Gangs have spread from a
localized phenomenon to nationally franchised businesses,
financed by drug money and armed with ever-higher caliber
weaponry. We're fueling a level of violence rarely seen before, a
violence now spilling over into areas that don't involve drugs. </p>

<p>We can't build new prisons fast enough to house all the drug
users we want to put in them. In some states, education budgets
are declining to guarantee sufficient money for jails. In our
panic about drugs, we are willing to sacrifice not only our
schools but our liberty. Forfeitures of property by drug users is
rising into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and virtually
all this revenue goes back into drug enforcement, creating an
unhealthy symbiotic relationship between drug dealers and the
police. </p>

<p>Last year, for the first time, military troops were used on
Marijuana raids. Strip-searches of high school students in Kansas
and Missouri elicit little protest, even when no drugs are found.
Anderson County, S.C., billboards announce, &quot;Need cash? Turn
in a drug dealer.&quot; Informers recieve as much as 25 percent
of the assets seized from drug raids. </p>

<p>Public pronouncements notwithstanding, the evidence is piling
up that the collateral damage from our War on Drugs far exceeds
the damage from drug use itself. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #84- Food for Thought </h3>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Well this info is a little different. It came from the Hungry
Bear Hemp Home Page at www.hempbc.com. These guys even sell hemp
seed nutrition bars. </p>

<p>Hemp Seed is one of the most nutritionally complete and
balanced foods on the planet in the following regard: </p>

<p>Protein---Second to soybeans in protein content (25%), and
contains all eight essential amino acids in amounts and
proportions necessary for the production of immune-enhancing
antibodies (such as gamma globulin). </p>

<p>Essential Fatty Acids (EFA's)---Hemp Seed is the richest plant
source of EFA's (80% of total oil volume). They are essential to
children for proper growth, used to perform various metabolic
rolds, indispensible in the structure and functioning of cell
membranes, regulators of cholesterol metabolism, and raw material
for hormone-like substances which regulate nearly all body
processes.* </p>

<p>* Rudin, Donald O. and Felix, Clara, The Omega=3 Phenomenon,
Rawson Associates, NY 1987 pp. 9, 10. </p>

<p>Content of all three EFA's in Hemp Seed Oil </p>

<p>Alpha Linolenic acid (LNA;Omega=3)...25% </p>

<p>Alpha Linoleic acid(LA;Omega=6)......55% </p>

<p>Arachididic acid....................0.5%* </p>

<p>*Sufficient amounts of this EFA are naturally converted from
LA in our bodies. </p>

<p>Linoleic acid is abundant in many of our common foods, yet LNA
and other Omega=3's are seldom found in sufficient amounts. As
you see above, Hemp Seed is very rich in thes EFA. </p>

<p>EFA deficiency (especially Alpha Linoleic Acid) symptoms
include the following: skin problems, hair loss, easy bruising,
inflammation of joints, fatigue, infertility, kidney problems, a
variety of neurological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular
problems, and a whole range of chronic degenerative disease. </p>

<p>Being a plant that can grow nearly everywhere humans inhabit
plus having a seed with a hull that seals in all these vital
proteins and oils for extended periods, Cannabis Hemp is the
ideal crop for famine-stricken bioregions (and anywhere else,
wouldn't you agree?). </p>

<p>May we also be aware of Hemp as our planet's most valuable
natural resource for industrial fiber, medicine and biomass fuel.

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Let me wish all of you a safe and happy Passover, Easter or
Weekend (your pick). Since this is a religous time of your, I
thought I'd bring this article out. This will be another of those
that goes on for several days. If anyone wants this in it's
entirety, email and request M.S. Word or text format. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT</b> </p>

<p>According to Jack Herer in The Emperor Wears No Clothes or
Everything You Wanted to Know About Marijuana But Were Not Taught
in School, &quot;The Essenes, a kabalistic priest/prophet/healer
sect of Judaism dating back to the era of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
used hemp, as did the Theraputea of Egypt, from where we get the
term 'therapeutic'.&quot; </p>

<p>The Theraputea of Egypt were Jewish ascetics that dwelt near
Alexandria and described by Philo (1st century B.C.) as devoted
to contemplation and meditation. Alexandria is where St. Mark is
traditionally held to have established the Coptic Church in 45
A.D. The Coptic Church has been neglected by Western scholars
despite its historical significance. This has been due to the
various biases and interest of the Catholic Church which claimed
Christianity for its own. The result is that for the Coptic
Church there is very little history. It is however assumed that
the Coptic religious services have their roots in the earliest
layers of Christian ritual in Jerusalem and it is known that the
Coptic church is of ancient origin going back to the time of the
first Christian communities and even before. </p>

<p>Tradition states that &quot;Coptic&quot; was derived from
&quot;Kuftaim&quot;, son of Mizraim, a grandchild of Noah who
first settled in the Nile valley, in the neighborhood of Thebes,
the ancient capital of Egypt. At one time Thebes was the greatest
city in the world and history records that by 2200 B.C. the whole
of Egypt was united under a Theban prince. The splendor of Thebes
was known to Homer, who called it &quot;the city with a hundred
gates&quot;. (Richard Schultes states that in ancient Thebes
marijuana was made into a drink.) </p>

<p>According to E.A. Wallis Budge in The Divine Origin of the
Herbalist, page 79, &quot;The Copts, that is to say the Egyptians
who accepted the teachings of St. Mark in the first century of
our era, and embraced Christianity, seem to have eschewed medical
science as taught by the physicians of the famous School of
Medicine of Alexandria, and to have been content with the methods
of healing employed by their ancestors.&quot; </p>

<p>The Essenes were an ascetic sect closely related to the
Theraputea that had established a monastic order in the desert
outside of Palestine and were known as spiritual healers. It has
been suggested that both John the Baptist and Jesus may have been
of the Essene sect as they were both heavily dependent on Essene
teachings. The scripture makes no mention of the life of Jesus
from the age of 13 to 30. Certain theologians speculate that
Jesus was being initiated by the Essenes, the last fraternity to
keep alive the ancient traditions of the prophets. </p>

<p>Every prophet, however great, must be initiated. His higher
self must be awakened and made conscious so that his mission can
be fulfilled. Amongst the Essenes' ritual lustrations preceded
most liturgical rites, the most important one of which was
participation in a sacred meal_an anticipation of the Messianic
banquet. </p>

<p>Throughout the ancient world sacrifice was a sacramental
communal meal involving the idea of the god as a participant in
the meal or as identical with the food consumed. The communion
sacrifice was one in which the deity indwells the oblation so
that the worshippers actually consume the divine. The original
motive of sacrifice was an effort toward communion among the
members of a group, on one hand, and between them and their god,
on the other. At its best, sacrifice was a &quot;sacrament&quot;
and in one form or another life itself. </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Hope everyone had a safe holiday. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT - Part 2.</b> </p>

<p>The central focus of the early Christian church was the
Eucharist or the &quot;body and blood&quot; of the Lord. This was
interpreted as a fellowship meal with the resurrected Christ. In
meeting the Resurrected One in the Eucharist meal the Christian
community had the expectation of the Kingdom of God and
salvation. </p>

<p>Christ communicated life to his disciples through the
Eucharist or Christian sacrament. Christ said in describing the
sacrament, &quot;Take, eat, this is my body, this is my blood. Do
this as often as you will in remembrance of me.&quot; (I
Corinthians 11:24-25) Baptism is defined as the Christian
sacrament used in purification and the spiritual rebirth of the
individual. I Corinthians 10:1 makes it clear that the smoking
cloud of incense was directly related to baptism. </p>

<p>I Corinthians 10:1 &quot;Moreover, brethren, I would not that
ye should be ignorant, how that our fathers were under the cloud,
and all passed through the sea; 2 And were all baptized unto
Moses in the Cloud and in the sea; 3 And did all eat the same
spiritual meat: for they drank of that Spiritual Rock that
followed them: and that Rock was Christ. </p>

<p>In the Biblical story of Creation, God said, &quot;Behold, I
have given you every herb bearing seed and to you it will be for
meat.&quot; (Genesis 1:29) Marijuana is technically an herb and
was considered a spiritual meat in the ancient world. From this
passage in Corinthians we see that the spiritual cloud resulting
from the burning of incense was instrumental in the baptism of
the Israelites. This baptism is also compared to the &quot;eating
and drinking&quot; of the spirit of Christ. </p>

<p>Spirit is defined as the active essence of the Deity serving
as an invisible and life-giving or inspiring power in motion.
Scripture makes it abundantly clear that the sacrificial cloud or
smoke contained the Spirit of God (Christ) and was instrumental
in inspiring, sanctifying, and purifying the patriarchs. In
Numbers 11:25 the cloud results in the Spirit resting upon Moses
and the seventy elders. This passage indicates that they
prophesied ecstatically. &quot;Prophesy&quot; is defined as
follows: to utter or announce by or as if by divine inspiration;
to speak for God or a deity; to give instruction in religious
matters. Throughout the Holy Bible prophets of God spake as they
were moved by the Holy Spirit. The smoking burning cloud of
incense contained the spirit and was instrumental in bringing
about the spiritual revelations of the prophets. In the ancient
world marijuana was used to reveal the future. The virtues of
marijuana include speech-giving and inspiration of mental powers.
&quot;Psychoactive&quot; is defined as effecting the mind or
behavior. </p>

<p>When we of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church think of mind or
behavior we think of that inward essence or element that makes up
the individual. This is the person's spirit. We are all spiritual
beings. It is just as important to keep the spiritual part of a
person healthy as it is to keep the physical body healthy and in
fact they are related. Hence marijuana and its relationship to
spiritual food. </p>

<p>In the Apocrypha (Book of Jubilees), Chapter 10, God tells an
angel to teach Noah the medicines which heal and protect from
evil spirits. Surely God taught Noah about marijuana. In the
ancient world marijuana played an important role in purification
and protecting from evil influences. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT</b> </p>

<p>Note the following concerning the transfiguration of Christ: </p>

<p>St. Matthew 17:1 &quot;And after six days Jesus taketh Peter,
James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high
mountain apart. 2 And he was transfigured before them: and his
face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as light. 3
And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
with him. 4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is
good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
tabernacles; one for thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias. 5
When yet he spake, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved
Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.&quot; </p>

<p>The Bible Dictionary by John McKenzie, page 898, says
concerning the transfiguration that the cloud and the formula of
the utterance of the Father are derived from the baptism of
Jesus. He says that the change described in the appearance of
Jesus suggests the change which is implied in the resurrection
narratives. </p>

<p>Some of the synonyms for transfiguration are transformation,
metamorphosis, transubstantiation, and avatar. These terms imply
the change that accompanies resurrection or deification. Across
the world, legends of godlike men who manage to rise, in a state
of perfection go back to an era before human beings had cast away
from the divine source. Hence the gods were beings which once
were men, and the actual race of men will in time become gods.
Christ revealed this to the people of his day when he told them
to whom the word of God came, &quot;Ye are gods.&quot; (St. John
10:34) </p>

<p>St. Matthew 17:2 says that during the transfiguration of
Christ that his face did shine as the sun. The face of Moses also
shone when he returned from the cloud on Mt. Sinai (Exodus
30:34). The shining countenances are the result of their
resurrections, of their being spiritually illumined in the cloud
of smoking incense. </p>

<p>Most people are under the impression that Christ baptized with
water. As you can see from the following account of John the
Baptist this isn't so. John the Baptist baptized with water and
Christ baptized with fire. </p>

<p>St. Matthew 3:11 &quot;I indeed baptize you with water into
repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit and with fire.&quot; </p>

<p>It is only logical that this baptism with the Holy Spirit and
with fire is related to the baptism of Christ in the burning,
smoking cloud of incense and to the baptism of the patriarchs in
which the patriarchs did all eat of the same spiritual meal
(incense). In the section dealing with the &quot;Holy
Spirit&quot; the Encyclopedia Britannica states that Christian
writers have seen in various references to the Spirit of Yahweh
in the Old Testament an anticipation of the doctrine of the Holy
Spirit. It also says that the Holy Spirit is viewed as the main
agent of man's restoration to his original natural state through
communion in Christ's body and, thus, as the principle of life in
the Christian community. </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Just finished watching &quot;Texas&quot; (had to tape it).
Surely they could have done better than Bobby Ewing playing the
part of my 5th great uncle Stephen F. Austin. </p>

<p><b>Part 4.</b> </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT</b> </p>

<p>The patriarchs were recipients of a revelation coming directly
from the Spirit (incense) and this was expressed in the
heightening and enlargement of their consciousness. It is clear
from Scripture that this spiritual dimension was also evident in
the life of Jesus, in whom the experience of the Hebrew prophets
was renewed. Through the Eucharist Christ passed this spiritual
dimension on to his apostles. One of the apostles even makes
mention in Philippians 4:18 of a sweet smelling sacrifice that is
well pleasing to God. </p>

<p>Christ compares this baptism to the drinking of a cup. </p>

<p>St. Mark 10:38 &quot;But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not
what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be
baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?&quot; </p>

<p>This cup is referred to as the cup of salvation in Psalms
116:12. </p>

<p>Psalms 116:12 &quot;What shall I render unto the Lord for all
his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation and call
upon the name of the Lord. </p>

<p>It is called the cup of blessing in connection in connection
with the eucharist. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 10:16 &quot;The cup of blessing which we bless,
is it not the communion of the blood and the body of Christ? 17
For we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all
partakers of one bread. </p>

<p>Here we see a connection between the cup of blessing and the
communion of the blood of Christ. Blood is the life-giving
substance of the living being. Christ communicated life to his
disciples through the Eucharist or Christian sacrament. </p>

<p>In I Corinthians 10:16 we note the mention of bread as the
communion of the body of Christ and that we are all partakers of
one bread. This is the spiritual bread or food used by Christ and
his disciples. (A synonym for the Eucharist or the Body and Blood
of the Lord is the bread of life.) It is interesting to note that
the finest marijuana in Jamaica is called Lamb's bread. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 12:13 &quot;For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether we be Jew or Gentiles, whether we
be bond or free; and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.
</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 11:25 &quot;After the same manner also he took
the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the New
Testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye eat this bread and drink
this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. </p>

<p>If these passages are compared to 1 Corinthians 10:1-4, it is
plain that the &quot;eating of one bread&quot; is the same as the
patriarchs &quot;eating the same spiritual meat&quot; and the
&quot;drinking of one Spirit&quot; (the cup) is the same as the
patriarchs &quot;drinking of the Spiritual Rock that followed
them: and that Rock was Christ.&quot; By making this comparison
we see that the terminology of the Eucharist is directly related
to the smoking cloud of incense used in the baptism of Christ and
the patriarchs. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that smoking was referred to as
&quot;eating&quot; or &quot;drinking&quot; by the early American
Indians. Peter J. Furst in Hallucinogen and Culture states the
following: </p>

<p>&quot;Considering its enormous geographic spread in the
Americas at the time of European discovery, as well as the
probable age of stone tobacco pipes in California, the inhaling
(often called &quot;drinking&quot; or &quot;eating&quot;) of
tobacco smoke by the Shaman, as a corollary to therapeutic
fumigation and the feeding of the gods with smoke, must also be
of considerable antiquity.&quot; </p>

<p>In Licit and Illicit Drugs, page 209, the following is quoted:
</p>

<p>&quot;Columbus and other early explorers who followed him were
amazed to meet Indians who carried rolls of dried leaves that
they set afire_and who then &quot;drank the smoke&quot; that
emerged from the rolls. Other Indians carried pipes in which they
burned the same leaves, and from which they similarly &quot;drank
the smoke&quot;. </p>

<p>Wow, what a night!! Actually heard a tornado passing by.
Luckily it didn't touch down in my part of town. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT -- Part 5</b> </p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica states in the section on
&quot;Sacrifice&quot; that the interpretation of sacrifice and
particularly of the Eucharist as sacrifice has varied greatly
within the different Christian traditions because of the
sacrificial terminology in which the Eucharist was originally
described became foreign to Christian thinkers. </p>

<p>We (Poster's Note--The poster is not a member of any organized
religion) of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare that the
true understanding of the Eucharist has been passed down from
generation to generation so that we are able to give an accurate
interpretation of the sacrificial terminology used to describe
the Eucharist. We have shown, using history and Biblical
passages, that his terminology is directly related to burning
smoking incense. We have shown that the &quot;eating&quot; or
&quot;drinking&quot; contained in the terminology concerning the
Eucharist is associated with the inhalation of smoke. We have
shown that marijuana was used as incense and that it was the
number one spiritual plant of the ancient world. </p>

<p>We of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare that the cup
that Christ baptized his disciples with in the baptism of the
Holy Spirit and fire was in fact a pipe or chillum in which
marijuana was smoked. This is a bottomless cup and soon as it is
emptied, it is filled again and passed in a circle. There is a
picture of this cup or pipe below, as well as on the cover. Like
the pipe of the ancient North American Indians, this cup was a
portable altar. </p>

<p>Christ was the Father of the doctrine of the Eucharist which
is the communion that Jesus gave his brethren. Jesus taught that
the communion is his body and blood. Jesus was not speaking of
His physical body and blood. He was speaking of His spiritual
body and spiritual blood that was the communion of his holy
church. The supper that Jesus celebrated with his disciples
&quot;on the night that he was betrayed&quot; (1 Corinthians
11:23) inaugurated the heavenly meal that was to be continued. </p>

<p>1 Corinthians 11:23 &quot;For I have received of the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same
night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had
given thanks, he brake it and said, Take, eat, this is my body,
which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me. 25 After
the same manner also he took the cup, which he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as
oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 26 For as often as ye
eat this bread, and drink of this cup, ye do shew the Lord's
death till he come. 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
bread, and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man
examine himself, and let him eat of the bread, and drink of that
cup. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. </p>

<p>Christ said, &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; Here
the original unity of man with God is restored. In general the
reception of the Holy Spirit is connected with the actual
realization, the inward experiencing of God. </p>

<p>Marijuana has been referred to as a mild euphoric (the
producer of a feeling of well-being) that produces a profound
religious experience of a mystical and transcendental nature.
This religious experience is said to be brought about by the
stirring of deeply buried, unconscious sensitivities so that one
experiences ultimate reality or the divine and confirms the
feeling of the worshipper that he has been in the presence of God
and has assimilated some of His powers. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT-- Part 6.</b> </p>

<p>To be lifted above sense to behold the beatific vision and
become &quot;incorporate&quot; in God is the end sought in
ecstasy. The priest or mystic in enthusiasm or ecstasy enjoys the
beatific vision by entering into communion with God and by
undergoing deification. The experience of ecstasy, states Mircea
Eliade, one of the foremost authorities on religion, is a
timeless primary phenomenon. Psychological experience of rapture,
he continues, are fundamental to the human condition and hence
known to the whole of archaic humanity. (Some of the synonyms of
rapture are bliss, beatitude, transport, exaltation.) </p>

<p>Baudelaire, a member of the Club Des Hashichins (Hashish Club)
founded in Paris around 1835 and writer of Artificial Paradises
states the following about hashish: Hashish is the unadulterated
resin from the flowering tops of the female hemp plant. </p>

<p>&quot;One will find in hashish nothing miraculous, absolutely
nothing but an exaggeration of the natural. The brain and
organisms on which hashish operates will produce only the normal
phenomena peculiar to that individual increased, admittedly, in
number and force, but always faithful to the original. A man will
never escape from his destined physical and moral temperament:
hashish will be a mirror of his impression and private thoughts a
magnifying mirror, it is true, but only a mirror. </p>

<p>He cautions that the user must be in the right frame of mind
to take hashish, for just as it exaggerates the natural behavior
of the individual, so too does hashish intensify the user's
immediate feelings. Baudelaire describes three successive phases
a hashish user will pass through. He says the final stage is
marked by a feeling of calmness, in which time and space have no
meaning, and there is a sense that one has transcended matter. He
says that in this state, one final supreme thought breaks into
consciousness. &quot;I have become God.&quot; </p>

<p>Realization of one's union with God is necessary in
understanding the true Christian sacrament. The understanding of
man's relationship to God and God's relationship to man (God in
Man and Man in God) was quite prevalent in the ancient world,
particularly among the religions that utilized marijuana as part
of their religious practice. </p>

<p>Said the great Hindu sage, Manu, &quot;He who in his own soul
perceives the Supreme Soul in all beings and acquires equanimity
toward them all, attains the highest bliss.&quot; To recognize
oneness of self with God was contained in all the teachings of
Gautama Buddha. In the Liturgy of Mithra (the Persian god of
light and truth) the suppliant prays &quot;abide with me in my
soul; leave me not,&quot; and &quot;that I may be initiated and
the Holy Spirit may breathe within me.&quot; The communion became
so intimate as to pass into identity: &quot;I am thou and thou
art I.&quot; Athanasius, a theologian, ecclesiastical statesman,
and Egyptian national leader who was closely tied to the Coptic
Church in Egypt said, &quot;Even we may become gods walking in
the flesh,&quot; and &quot;God became man that man might become
God.&quot; </p>

<p>Western theology (Catholic and Protestant) teaches that the
spirit created matter but remained aloof of it. In Hinduism and
other Eastern religions, the spirit is the inside, the matter is
the outside; the two are inseparable. Eastern theologians hive
rightly perceived that the God one worships must posses all the
aspects of his worshippers' nature as well as his own divine
nature. Otherwise, how can he create beings whose nature is
entirely foreign to his own? What, then, would be the meaning of
the Biblical phrase: &quot;God made man in his own image&quot;? </p>

<p>Hemp FACT #91-Sacrament-7 </p>

<p>Date: 95-04-22 09:55:50 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>I haven't read this many Bible verses since Sunday school. For
those that attend church, synagogue, temple, etc-- Are you going
to cut-n-paste this article and give it to your pastors, rabbis,
shaman and the like? ;-) </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT-- Part 7.</b> </p>

<p>The fact that modern Christendom has no sense of union with
God has led to numerous churches without the understanding for
building a Christian culture and kingdom to replace the confusion
of modern politics. This lack of understanding was not lacking in
the ancient church and was a major source of enthusiasm for the
prophets of old. In fact, the power of the early church was
manifested due to this understanding of the spirit of God
dwelling in man, the temple of God. To the ancient prophets it
was not a God above, nor a God over yonder, but a God within.
&quot;Be still and know that I am God&quot; for the visionaries
and mystics of every time and place, this has been the first and
greatest of the commandments. </p>

<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:28 Christ said, &quot;Let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the
cup.&quot; Probably the most relevant study to date about what
might be considered typical marijuana experience concludes that
marijuana gives spontaneous insights into self (Dr. Charles Tart,
&quot;On Being Stoned: A Psychological Study of Marijuana
Intoxication&quot;, Science and Behavior, 1971). </p>

<p>The sacramentality of marijuana is declared by Christ himself
and can be understood only when a person partakes of the natural
divine herb. The fact is communion of Jesus cannot be disputed or
be destroyed. Marijuana is the new wine divine and cannot be
compared to the old wine, which is alcohol. Jesus rejected the
old wine and glorified the &quot;new wine&quot; at the wedding
feast of Cana. Cana is a linguistic derivation of the present day
cannabis and so it is. (Some Biblical scholars and there is a
certain amount of support in early tradition of the view have
looked upon the miracle of Cana as a sign of the Eucharist.) </p>

<p>Note the references to new wine in the Bible: </p>

<p>Isaiah 65:8 &quot;Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is
found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a
blessing is in it; so will I do for my servant's sake&quot; </p>

<p>Acts 2:13 &quot;Others mocking said, &quot;These men are full
of new wine.&quot; </p>

<p>Isaiah 65:8 declares that the new wine is found in the cluster
and that a blessing is in it. When one mentions clusters, one
thinks of clusters of grapes. Webster's New Riverside Dictionary,
Office Edition, defines marijuana: 1. Hemp 2. The dried flower
clusters and leaves of the hemp plant, esp. when taken to induce
euphoria. </p>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica says the following about hemp: </p>

<p>Seed producing flowers form elongate, spike like clusters
growing on the pistillate, or female plants; pollen producing
flowers form many branched clusters or staminate, on male plants.
Here and in Webster's, marijuana fits the description of the new
wine and as history has shown a blessing is in it. </p>

<p>Baudelaire said the following about the effects of hashish: </p>

<p>&quot;This marvelous experience often occurs as if it were the
effect of superior and invisible power acting on the person from
without...This delightful and singular state...gives no advance
warning. It is as unexpected as a ghost, an intermittent haunting
from which we must draw, if we are wise, the certainty of a
better existence. This acuteness of thought, this enthusiasm of
the senses and the spirit must have appeared to man through the
ages as the first blessing.&quot; </p>

<p>In the books of Acts the apostles were accused of being full
of new wine. Acts 2:13 was the time of pentecost when the Holy
Spirit descended upon the apostles. Numerous outpourings of the
Spirit are mentioned in the Acts of the apostles in which
healing, prophesy, and the expelling of demons are particularly
associated with the activity of the Spirit. Incense (marijuana)
was used by the ancients for healing, prophesy, and the expelling
of demons. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #92-Sacrament-8 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-23 09:55:59 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Now this is ridiculous. It's late April and the wind chill
here in Dallas is in the upper 20's this morning. :-o O.K. you
northerners, quit laughing, we're spoiled down here. </p>

<p>A SPECIAL NOTE-- There is a 60 Minutes program on tonight that
is supposed to be critical of DEA/FBI. Don't know any details. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT--Part 8.</b> </p>

<p>When Christ ascended into heaven in the cloud (Acts 1:9-11) he
sent his disciples the Holy Spirit with the &quot;gift of
tongues&quot; (Acts 2:3) and there appeared unto them cloven
tongues like as a fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they
were filled with the Holy Spirit and were given the power to
prophesy or witness. (Marijuana has been credited with speech
giving and inspiration of mental powers.) </p>

<p>The first two gifts of the Holy Spirit are traditionally said
to be wisdom and understanding, which no doubt are the two things
most needed by the human race. In Jamaica today marijuana is
referred to as the &quot;weed of wisdom&quot; and is reputed to
be the plant that grew on Solomon's grave, a man known for his
great wisdom. Marijuana expands consciousness and enhances the
capacity for mystical and creative inspiration. In Acts 2:3 Fire
speaks figuratively of the Holy Spirit. Fire was also a means
which to transport a saint to heaven. </p>

<p>2 Kings 2:11 &quot;And it came to pass, as they still went on,
and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and
horses of fire, and parted asunder; and Elijah went up by a
whirlwind into heaven.&quot; </p>

<p>Recent writers have speculated that this passage was in
reference to flying saucers. That is because they look at this
passage physically. This ascension of Elijah like the ascension
of Christ in the cloud into heaven is the &quot;withdrawal&quot;
from the external or physical world, to be the inmost reality of
all. This can be referred to as ecstasy, rapture, or transport
and is a result of the Holy Spirit. Ecstasy, rapture, or
transport therefor agree in designating a feeling or state of
intense, often extreme mental and emotional exaltation. Rapture
is defined as ecstatic joy or delight; joyful ecstasy. Some of
the synonyms of rapture are bliss, beatitude, transport, and
exultation. The true rapture is therefore one in which one is
spiritually transported to the heavens. Don't expect to float up
into the sky. </p>

<p>Marijuana as history has shown is the catalyst used to achieve
the spiritual journey into the heavens. That is why in India it
was referred to as the Heavenly-Guide, the Poor Man's Heaven, and
the Sky-flier. That is why Professor Mircea Eliade, perhaps the
foremost authority on the history of religion, suggested that
Zoroaster may have caused hemp to bridge the metaphysical gap
between heaven and earth. </p>

<p>One dictionary defines marijuana as the leaves and flowering
tops when taken to induce euphoria. Euphoria is defined by the
same dictionary as great happiness or bliss. (In India, marijuana
has been referred to as the joy-giver and the soother of grief.)
Bliss is defined as the ecstasy of salvation, spiritual joy. Some
of the synonyms of bliss are beatitude, transport, rapture,
ecstasy, paradise, heaven. </p>

<p>Throughout the ancient world there is mention of &quot;magical
flight&quot;, &quot;ascent to heaven&quot;, and &quot;mystical
journey&quot;. All these mythological and folklore traditions
have their point of departure in an ideology and technique of
ecstasy that imply &quot;journey in spirit&quot;. </p>

<p>Part 9. Tomorrow..Pass it on :-) </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #93-Sacrament-9 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-24 10:10:01 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT--Part 9.</b> </p>

<p>The pilgrimage from earth to heaven is not a journey to some
other place or some other time, but is a journey within. One must
realize that &quot;death&quot; through which we must pass before
God can be seen does not lie ahead of us in time. Rather it is
now that we have a man of sin within us that must be killed and a
new man free from sin that must be born. This is actualized in
baptism and the sacramental life in the church. For as many of
you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ
(Galatians 3:27). The effect of baptism is spiritual regeneration
or rebirth, whereby one is &quot;enChristened&quot;, involving
both union with Christ and remission of sins. In Titus 3:5
baptism is the &quot;bath of regeneration&quot; accompanying
renewal by the Spirit. Some of the synonyms of regeneration are
beatification, conversion, sanctification, salvation,
inspiration, bread of life, Body and Blood of Christ. </p>

<p>Sara Benetowa of the Institute of Anthropological Sciences in
Warsaw is quoted in the Book of Grass as saying: </p>

<p>&quot;By comparing the old Slavic word 'Kepati' and the
Russian 'Kupati' with the Scythian 'cannabis' Shrader developed
and justified Meringer's supposition that there is a link between
the Scythian baths and Russian vapor baths. </p>

<p>&quot;In the entire Orient even today to 'go to the bath'
means not only to accomplish an act of purification and enjoy a
pleasure, but also to fulfill the divine law. Vambery calls
'bath' any club in which the members play checkers, drink coffee,
and smoke hashish or tobacco.&quot; </p>

<p>St. Matthew's account of the institution of the Eucharist
attaches to the Eucharist cup these words: &quot;Drink of it, all
of, for this is the blood of the covenant, which is poured out
for many for the remission of sins (st. Matthew 26:27). Drinking
the sacramental cup therefor serves like baptism (Acts 2:38)
where Peter said unto them, &quot;Repent, and be baptized
everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. We of the
Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church declare a three-part doctrine of the
Holy Herb, the Holy Word, and the Holy Man (Woman). </p>

<p>The present and future benefits to the individual communicant
have their importance given them by Jesus, who said, &quot;He who
eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will
raise them up at the last day.&quot; (John 6:54) As such we must
see that the divine person who is active in creation, in renewal,
and in human rebirth and resurrection, is also active in the
Eucharist. </p>

<p>There was a profound change in America when marijuana smoking
started on a large scale in the late 1960's. A large number of
people resisted the draft, resisted the war ... started letting
their hair and beards grow ... became interested in natural
foods... the ecology and the environment. What we really saw was
the awakening of our generation to the beginning of Christian
mentality through marijuana smoking. The earmarks of this
mentality are: I don't want to go to war; I really don't want to
be part of the political-military-economic fiasco you call
society. </p>

<p>Like the Indians Hemp Drug Commission three quarters of a
century earlier, the Canadian Le Dain Commission conducted an
inquiry into the use of marijuana. On page 156 of the report is
the following: </p>

<p>Part 10. Tomorrow--Pass it on :-) </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #94-Sacrament-10 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-25 10:16:13 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>Didn't mean to leave a cliffhanger yesterday or am I the only
one that </p>

<p>noticed it. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT--Part 10.</b> </p>

<p>&quot;In the case of cannabis, the positive points which are
claimed for it include the following: It is a relaxant; it is
disinhibiting; it increases self-confidence and the feeling of
creativity (whether justified by creative </p>

<p>results or not); it increases sensual awareness and
appreciation; it facilitates self acceptance and in this way
makes it easier to accept others; it serves a sacramental
function in promoting a sense of spiritual community among users;
it is a shared pleasure; because it is illicit and the object of
strong disapproval from those who are, by and large, opposed to
social change, it is a symbol of protest and a means of
strengthening the sense of identity among those who are strongly
critical of certain aspects of our society and value structure
today.&quot; </p>

<p>On page 144 of the Report, marijuana is associated with peace.
</p>

<p>&quot;In our conversation with (students and young people)
they have frequently contrasted marijuana and alcohol effects to
describe the former as a drug of peace, a drug that reduces
tendencies to aggression while suggesting that the latter drug
produces hostile, aggressive behavior. Thus marijuana is seen as
particularly appropriate to a generation that emphasizes peace
and is, in many ways, anticompetitive.&quot; </p>

<p>In a magazine article by G. S. Chopra entitled &quot;Man and
Marijuana&quot; on page 235 is a section dealing with Human
Experiments. One hundred persons with an established marijuana
smoking habit smoked marijuana. They described the symptoms as
follows: &quot;I have done things today which I usually dislike
but which I rather enjoyed doing today.&quot; &quot;Nothing
seemed impossible to accomplish.&quot; &quot;I assumed a cool and
composed attitude and forgot all mental worries.&quot; &quot;I
behaved in a childish and foolish manner.&quot; &quot;It relieves
sense of fatigue and gives rise to feelings of happiness.&quot;
&quot;I feel like laughing.&quot; &quot;My head is dizzy.&quot;
&quot;I feel like taking more food.&quot; &quot;The world is gay
around me.&quot; &quot;I feel inclined to work.&quot; &quot;I am
a friend to all and have no enemy in the world.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, in the section on
&quot;Roman Catholicism&quot;: </p>

<p>&quot;To understand the meaning and use of the Eucharist we
must see it as an act of universal worship, of cooperation, of
association else it loses the greater part of its significance.
Neither in Roman Catholic nor in Protestant Eucharistic practice
does the sacrament retain much of the symbolism of Christian
unity, which clearly it has. Originally, the symbolism was that
of a community meal, an accepted social symbol of community
throughout the whole of human culture.&quot; </p>

<p>Marijuana has been used as sacrifice, a sacrament, a ritual
fumigant (incense), a good-will offering, and as a means of
communing with the divine spirit. It has been used to seal
treaties, friendships, solemn binding agreements and to
legitimize covenants. It has been used as a traditional defense
against evil and in purification. It has been used in divinations
(1. the art or practice that seeks to foresee or foretell future
events or discover hidden knowledge; 2. unusual insight;
intuitive perception.) It has been used in remembrance of the
dead and praised for its medicinal properties. </p>

<p>Most Christians agree that participation in the Eucharist is
supposed to enhance and deepen communion of believers not only
with Christ but also with one another. We must therefor ask the
question, &quot;What substance did the ancients use as a
community meal to facilitate communion with the Lord?&quot; The
answer to that question is marijuana. Hemp as originally used in
religious ritual, temple activities, and tribal rites, involved
groups of worshippers rather than the solitary individual. The
pleasurable psychoactive effects were then, as now, communal
experiences. </p>

text of this article than I have of any other. When I first read
it, I thought it was going to be boring. I personally do not

hypocritical. After reading this, it looks like the roots of
religion are in the right place. Inner peace, respecting others
and all that stuff. </p>

<p><b>MARIJUANA AS THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT-Part 11</b>. </p>

<p>(I didn't realize there was this little left when I posted
yesterday) </p>

<p>Practically every major religion and culture of the ancient
world utilized marijuana as part of their religious observance.
Marijuana was the ambrosia of the ancient world. It was the food,
drink, and perfume of the gods. It was used by the Africans, the
Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Asians, the Europeans, and possibly
the Indians of the Americas. Would it be too much to suggest that
the ancient Israelites also utilized marijuana? </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #96-Reefer Madness-1 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-27 11:23:45 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>The following post was taken from: </p>

<p>Newsgroups: alt.hemp </p>

<p>Subject: Reefer Madness??? </p>

<p>Date: 9 Jun 1994 04:27:08 -0400 </p>

<p><b>Part 1.</b> </p>

<p><b>Essay:</b> </p>

<p><b>Reefer Madness?</b> </p>

<p><b>By</b> </p>

<p><b>Dune Hartsell</b> </p>

<p>For thousands of years, Hemp (Cannabis Sativa) has been one of
the most useful plants known to man. It's strong, stringy fibers
make durable rope and can be woven into anything from sails to
shirts; it's pithy centers, or &quot;Hurds,&quot; make excellent
paper; it's seeds, high in protein and oil, have been pressed
into lighting or lubricating oils and pulped into animal feed;
and extracts of it's leaves have provided a wide range of
medicines and tonics. </p>

<p>Hemp also has a notable place in American history: </p>

<p>-Washington and Jefferson grew it. </p>

<p>-Our first flags were likely made of hemp cloth. </p>

<p>-The first and second drafts of the Declaration of
Independence were written on paper made from Dutch Hemp. </p>

<p>-When the pioneers went west, their wagons were covered with
hemp canvas (the word &quot;canvas&quot; comes from canabacius ,
hemp cloth). </p>

<p>-The first &quot;Levis&quot; sold to prospectors were sturdy
hemp coveralls. </p>

<p>-Abraham Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd, came from the richest hemp
growing family in Kentucky. </p>

<p>After the Civil War, however, hemp production in the States
declined steeply. Without slave labor, hemp became too expensive
to process. Besides, cotton ginned by machines was cheaper.
Still, hemp fabric remained the second most common cloth in
America. </p>

<p>The plant's by-products remained popular well into this
century. Maple Sugar combined with Hashish (a resin from hemp
leaves) was sold over the counter and in Sears Roebuck catalogs
as a harmless candy. </p>

<p>Hemp rope was a mainstay of the Navy. Two thousand tons of
hemp seed were sold annually as birdfeed. The pharmaceutical
industry used hemp extracts in hundreds of potions and vigorously
fought attempts to restrict hemp production. And virtually all
good paints and varnishes were made from hemp-seed oil and/or
linseed oil. </p>

<p>In the 1920's and '30s the American public became increasingly
concerned about drug addiction-----especially to Morphine and a
&quot;miracle drug&quot; that had been introduced by the Bayer
Company in 1898 under the brand name &quot;Heroin.&quot; By the
mid-1920's, there were 20,000 heroin addicts in the U.S. alone. </p>

<p>Most Americans were unaware that smoking hemp was
intoxicating; however, until William Randolph Hearst launched a
campaign of sensational stories that linked &quot;the killer
weed&quot; to everything from Jazz to &quot;Crazed
minorities,&quot; and even unspeakable crimes. Hearst's papers
featured headlines like: </p>

<p>MARIJUANA MAKES FIENDS OF BOYS IN 30 DAYS: </p>

<p>HASIESH GOADS USERS TO BLOOD LUST </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>NEW DOPE LURE, MARIJUANA, HAS MANY VICTIMS </p>

<p>In 1930 Hearst was joined in his crusade against hemp by Harry
J. Anslinger, commissioner of the newly organized Federal Bureau
of Narcotics (FBN). Hearst often quoted Anslinger in his
newspaper stories, printing sensational comments like: &quot;If
the hideous monster Frankenstein came face to face with the
monster marijuana he would drop dead of fright.&quot; </p>

<p>Not everyone shared their opinion. In 1930, the US government
formed the Siler Commission to study marijuana smoking by
off-duty servicemen in Panama. The Commission found no lasting
effects and recommended that no criminal penalties apply to it's
use. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, Hearst's and Anslinger's anti-hemp campaign had
results. By 1931, twenty-nine states had prohibited marijuana use
for nonmedical purposes. In 1937, after two years of secret
hearings and based largely on Anslinger's testimony, Congress
passed the Marijuana Tax Act, which essentially outlawed
marijuana in America. </p>

<p>Because Congress was not sure it was constitutional to ban
hemp outright, it taxed the plant prohibitively instead. Hemp
growers had to register with the government; sellers and buyers
had to fill out cumbersome paperwork; and, of course, it was a
federal crime not to comply. </p>

<p><b>Reefer Madness?</b> </p>

<p><b>By</b> </p>

<p><b>Dune Hartsell</b> </p>

<p>For selling an ounce or less of marijuana to an unregistered
person, the federal tax was 100 dollars. (To give some sense on
how prohibitive the tax was, &quot;legitimate&quot; marijuana was
selling for $2 a pound at the time. In 1994 dollars, the federal
tax would be roughly 2,000 dollars an ounce.) </p>

<p>The Marijuana Tax Act effectively destroyed all legitimate
commercial cultivation of hemp. Limited medical use was
permitted, but as hemp derivatives became prohibitively expensive
for doctors and pharmacists, they turned to chemically derived
drugs instead. All other nonmedical uses, from rope to industrial
lubricants, were taxed out of existence. </p>

<p>With most of their markets gone, farmers stopped growing hemp,
and the legitimate industry disappeared. Ironically, though, hemp
continued to grow wild all over the country, and its
&quot;illegitimate&quot; use was little affected by Congress. </p>

<p>Was a viable hemp industry forced out of existence because it
was a threat to people's health or because it was a threat to a
few large businesses that would profit from banning it? </p>

<p>Here are some facts, hemp was outlawed just as a new
technology would have made hemp paper far cheaper than wood-pulp
paper. </p>

<p>Traditionally, hemp fiber had to be separated from the stalk
by hand, and the cost of labor made this method uncompetitive.
But in 1937, the year that hemp was outlawed, the decoricator
machine was invented; it could process as much as three tons of
hemp an hour and produced higher quality fibers with less loss of
fiber than wood-based pulp. According to some scientists, hemp
would have been able to undercut competing products overnight.
Enthusiastic about the new technology, Popular Mechanics
predicted that hemp would become America's first &quot;billion
dollar crop.&quot; The magazine pointed out that &quot;10,000
acres devoted to hemp will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres
of average [forest] pulp land.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Jack Herer, an expert on the &quot;hemp
conspiracy,&quot; Hearst, the Du Ponts and other &quot;industrial
barons and financiers knew that machinery to cut, bale,
decoriticate (separate fiber from the stalk) and process hemp
into paper was becoming available in the mid 1930's.&quot; (The
Emperor Wears No </p>

<p>Clothes ) </p>

<p>Hearst, one of the promoters of the anti-hemp hysteria, had a
vested interest in protecting the pulp industry. Hearst owned
enormous timber acreage; competition from hemp paper might have
driven the Hearst paper-manufacturing division out of business
and cause the value of his acreage to plummet. (ibid) </p>

<p>Herer says that Hearst was even responsible for popularizing
the term &quot;marijuana&quot; in American culture. In fact, he
suggests, popularizing the word was a key strategy of Hearst's
efforts: &quot;The first step in creating hysteria was to
introduce the element of fear of the unknown by using a word that
no one had ever heard of before...'marijuana.'&quot; (ibid) </p>

<p>The DuPont Company also had an interest in the pulp industry.
At this time, it was in the process of patenting a new sulfuric
acid process for producing wood-pulp paper. According to the
company's own records, wood-pulp products ultimately accounted
for more than 80% of all of DuPont's railroad car loadings for
the next 50 years. (ibid) </p>

<p>But DuPont had even more reasons to be concerned about hemp.
In the 1930's, the company was making drastic changes in its
business strategy.Traditionally a manufacturer of military
explosives, DuPont realized after the end of World War I that
developing peacetime uses for artificial fibers and plastics
would be more profitable in the long run. So it began pouring
millions of dollars into research, Which resulted in the
development of such synthetic fibers as rayon and nylon. </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #98-Reefer Mdnss-3 </h3>

<p>Date: 95-04-29 10:34:26 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p>The following was taken from: </p>

<p>Newsgroups: alt.hemp </p>

<p>Subject: Reefer Madness??? </p>

<p>Date: 9 Jun 1994 04:27:08 -0400 </p>

<p><b>Final Part.</b> </p>

<p><b>Essay:</b> </p>

<p><b>Reefer Madness?</b> </p>

<p><b>By</b> </p>

<p><b>Dune Hartsell</b> </p>

<p>-Two years before the prohibitive hemp tax, DuPont developed a
new synthetic fiber, nylon, which was an ideal substitute for
hemp rope. </p>

<p>-The year after the hemp tax, DuPont was able to bring another
&quot;miracle&quot; synthetic fabric onto the market, rayon.
Rayon, which became widely used for clothing, was a direct
competitor to hemp cloth. </p>

<p>-&quot;Congress and the Treasury Department were assured,
through secret testimony given by DuPont, that Hemp-seed oil
could be replaced with synthetic petrochemical oils made
principally by DuPont.&quot; These oils were used in paints and
other products.(ibid) </p>

<p>The millions spent on these products, as well as the hundreds
of millions in expected profits from them, could have been wiped
out if the newly affordable hemp products were allowed on the
market. So, according to Herer, DuPont worked with Hearst to
eliminate hemp. </p>

<p>DuPont's point man was none other than Harry Anslinger, the
commissioner of the FBN. Anslinger was appointed to the FBN by
Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who was also chairman of the
Mellon Bank, DuPont's chief financial backer. But Anslinger's
relationship to Mellon wasn't just political; he was also married
to Mellon's niece. </p>

<p>Anslinger apparently used his political clout to sway
congressional opinion on the hemp tax. According to Herer, the
American Medical Association (AMA) tried to argue for the medical
benefits of hemp. But after the AMA officials testified to
Congress, &quot;they were quickly denounced by Anslinger and the
entire congressional committee, and curtly excused.&quot; </p>

<p>Five years after the hemp tax was imposed, when Japanese
seizure of Philippine hemp caused a wartime shortage of rope, the
government reversed itself. Overnight, the U.S. government urged
hemp cultivation once again and created a stirring movie called
&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot; then, just as quickly, it
recriminalized hemp after the shortage had passed. </p>

<p>While U.S. hemp was temporarily legal, however, it saved the
life of a young pilot named George Bush, who was forced to bail
out of his burning airplane after a battle over the Pacific. At
the time he didn't know that: </p>

<p>-Parts of his aircraft engine were lubricated with hemp-seed
oil. </p>

<p>-100% of his life-saving parachute webbing was made from U.S.
grown hemp. </p>

<p>-Virtually all of the rigging and lines of the ship that
rescued him were made of hemp. </p>

<p>-The flightsuit on his back was a rubberized hemp-cloth. </p>

<p>-The fire hoses on the ship were woven from hemp Ironically,
President Bush consistently opposed decriminalizing hemp grown in
the United States. </p>

<p>Does the hemp conspiracy continue? in March 1992, Robert
Bonner, the chief of the Drug Enforcement Agency, effectively
rejected a petition to permit doctors to prescribe marijuana for
patients as medication for chronic pain. Bonner said:
&quot;Beyond doubt the claims that marijuana is medicine are
false, dangerous and cruel.&quot; But, according to a federal
administrative law judge, Francis Young, &quot;The record clearly
shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving
the distress of great numbers of very ill people and doing so
with safety under medical supervision.&quot; ( The New York
Times) </p>

<p>There WILL be a Sunday post, now that I have a new computer at
the house. Can't believe I'm almost to FACT 100. I hope those of
you that read my daily post are sharing the information with
others. I have no clue as to how many people read this post, but
I've heard it's quite a few. </p>

<p>See ya manana.. Pass it on :-) </p>

<h3>Hemp FACT #100-Personal Views </h3>

<p>Date: 95-05-01 09:27:12 EDT </p>

<p>From: ADBryan </p>

<p><b>HEMP FACT OF THE DAY #100 (fireworks, cheers, etc. ;-) --
My Personal Feelings.</b> </p>

<p>What an education I have had since I started these posts. I
knew many of the FACTS, but I didn't know all of them especially
all of the medical and industrial uses for hemp. </p>

<p>I realize there are many under age 18 on AOL. I DO NOT
ADVOCATE THE USE OF ANY SUBSTANCE THAT MIGHT BE HARMFUL TO ANYONE
UNDER THE AGE OF 18. (Wait until you're in college to experiment.
I did. It'll give you something to look forward too ;-) </p>

<p>I would like to thank those of you that have been reading Hemp
FACTS over the past few months. I can't believe this is #100. I
still have no idea how many of you are reading this information.
I have tried to get the numbers from AOL, but was told they are
not available. The best guess I have is anywhere from 100-200 on
the low side to maybe a few thousand. </p>

<p>The information posted here is meant to be shared with others.
Make copies of the documents and post them to other boards
(something other than AOL) or email them to people that NEED to
read them. One of the things I would like to see from the ones of
you that frequent the &quot;chat areas&quot;, is to engage people
in meaningful discussion on how the WOD has failed miserably.
Then direct them to this or any of the other areas where the WOD
is discussed. The more people that become familiar with the
FACTS, the better chance we have of ending the WOD. </p>

<p>My company writes software for insurance companies and agents,
and I will engage the &quot;ties&quot; on this subject. I have
never had ONE disagree with me after I laid out the FACTS. Of
course I don't talk to every single one of them about it, but any
time I can manipulate the conversation in that direction, I make
my point. </p>

<p>Many people fear to publically speak of ending the WOD for
fear of being labeled as a drug user. One of the things I tell
the insurance people, is that is people want to go knock
themselves out on drugs, that's their problem. For those
addicted, it's a medical problem. When someone says that if drugs
are legal, there will be rampant drug use, ask them if they are
going to be 1st in line at the cocaine counter. They will usually
get your point. Another thing to point out is the mandatory
sentences for drug offenders. This is why our jails are
overcrowded. It pushes the violent offenders back on the streets,
'cause there's no room for them in prison. </p>

<p>Remember, &quot;Send a druggie to jail, set a rapist
free.&quot; <br>

<p> _<b>9513: Access to Therapeutic Marijuana/Cannabis</b>_<br>
</p>

<p> The American Public Health Association, </p>

<p> Being aware that cannabis/marijuana has been used medicinally
for centuries and that cannabis products were widely prescribed
by physicians in the United States until 1937 [1,2]; and </p>

<p> Being aware that &quot;marijuana&quot; prohibition began with
the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 under false claims despite
disagreeing testimony from the AMA's representative [3,4]; and </p>

<p> Being further aware that the Controlled Substances Act of
1970 completely prohibited all medicinal use of marijuana by
placing it in the most restrictive category of Schedule I,
whereby drugs must meet three criteria for placement in this
category: 1) have no therapeutic value, 2) are not safe for
medical use, and 3) have a high abuse potential [5]; and </p>

<p> Being cognizant that the Drug Enforcement Administration's
own administrative law judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be
removed from Schedule I and made available for physicians to
prescribe [6-8]; and </p>

<p> Knowing that 36 states have passed legislation recognizing
marijuana's therapeutic value [9,10]; and </p>

<p> Also knowing that the only available access to legal
marijuana which was through the Food and Drug Administration's
Investigational New Drug Program has been closed by the Secretary
of Health and Human Services since 1992 [11]; and </p>

<p> Understanding that while synthetic Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
is available in pill form, it is only one of approximately 60
cannabinoids which may have medicinal value individually or in
some combination; and </p>

<p> Understanding that marijuana has an extremely wide acute
margin of safety for use under medical supervision and cannot
cause lethal reactions [6,32,34]; and </p>

<p> Understanding that marijuana has been reported to be
effective in: a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma
[12,13]; b) reducing nausea and vomiting associated with
chemotherapy [14-16]; c) stimulating the appetite for patients
living with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and
suffering from the wasting syndrome [17-19]; d) controlling
spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple
sclerosis [20-25]; e) decreasing the suffering from chronic pain
[26-28]; and f) controlling seizures associated with seizure
disorders [29-31]; and </p>

<p> Understanding that marijuana seems to work differently from
many conventional medications for the above problems, making it a
possible option for persons resistant to the conventional
medications [32,33]; and </p>

<p> Being concerned that desperate patients and their families
are choosing to break the law to obtain this medicine when
conventional medicines or treatments have not been effective for
them or are too toxic [34,35]; and </p>

<p> Realizing that this places ill persons at risk for criminal
charges and at risk for obtaining contaminated medicine because
of the lack of quality control; and </p>

<p> Realizing that thousands of patients not helped by
conventional medications and treatments may find relief from
their suffering with the use of marijuana if their primary care
providers were able to prescribe this medicine; and </p>

<p> Concluding that cannabis/marijuana was wrongfully placed in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act depriving patients of
its therapeutic potential; and </p>

<p> Recognizing that APHA adopted a resolution (7014) on
Marijuana and the Law which urged federal and state drug laws to
exclude marijuana from classification as a narcotic drug [36];
and </p>

<p> Concluding that greater harm is caused by the legal
consequences of its prohibition than possible risks of medicinal
use; therefore </p>

<p> 1. Encourages research of the therapeutic properties of
various cannabinoids and combinations of cannabinoids; </p>

<p> 2. Encourages research on alternative methods of
administration to decrease the harmful effects related to
smoking; </p>

<p> 3. Urges the Administration and Congress to move
expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine
where shown to be safe and effective and to immediately allow
access to therapeutic cannabis through the Investigational New
Drug Program. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font> </p>

<p>An electronic search of the published research literature
through computerised on-line services, such as DIALOG Information
Services, reveals that since the mid 1960's over 4000 papers,
monographs and books on medical, psychological and social aspects
of cannabis use and abuse have been published.1 These studies cut
across a wide range of disciplines including: the potential
teratogenicity of D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and related compounds
(Cohen, 1986; Fried, 1989; Fried and O'Connell, 1987; Hill and
Tennyson, 1986; Stern, 1981; Qazi, Mariano, Milman, Beller and
Crombleholme, 1985); histopathology and functional occlusion of
the pulmonary system (Henderson, Tennant and Guerry 1972;
Tashkin, Shapiro, Ramanna, Taplin, Lee, and Harper, 1976;
Tashkin, Shapiro, Lee, and Harper, 1976; Tennant, Guerry, and
Henderson, 1980); cardiovascular changes (Aronow and Cassidy,
1974; Benowitz and Jones, 1975; Stimmel, 1979); possible
permanent neurological effects (Campbell, Evans, Thomson, and
Williams, 1971; Co, Goodwin, Gado, Mikhael, and Hill, 1977;
Feinberg, Jones, Walker, Cavness, and Floyd, 1976; Fried, 1989;
Grant, Rochford, Fleming, and Stunkard, 1973; Grant, Rochford,
Fleming, and Stunkard, 1973; Hannerz and Hindmarsh, 1983; Heath,
1972; Heath, 1973; Heath, Fitzjarrell, Garey, and Myers, 1979;
Kuehnle, Mendelson, Davis, and New, 1977; Tassinari, Amrosetto,
Peraita-Adrados, and Gastaut, 1976); the likelihood of the
existence of a psychological complex of behaviours and attitudes
collectively referred to as the &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; (Creason and Goldman 1981; McGlothlin and West,
1968; Smith, 1968; Weller, 1985); the possible effects on
learning and behaviour (DSM-III-R.; Fabian and Fishkin, 1981;
Fried, 1977; Johnston, O'Malley, and Bachman, 1986; Jones, 1975,
1980; Kolansky and Moore, 1971; McBay, 1986; Mullins, Vitola, and
Abellera, 1974; Weller, 1985); and the possibility of a
relationship between cannabis use and major psychiatric disorders
(DSM-III-R, 1987; Andreasson, Allebeck, and Rydberg, 1989; Imade
and Ebie, 1991; Lavik and Onstad, 1986; Meyer, 1975; Negrete,
Knapp, Douglas, and Smith, 1986; Thacore and Shukla, 1976;
Thornicroft, 1990; Tunving, 1985). Amongst these papers are a
number of fairly thorough review articles and books which attempt
an overview of most areas of cannabis research (Cohen, 1986;
Hollister, 1988; Jones, 1980; Nahas, 1984; Nahas and Latour,
1992; Petersen, 1980).<br>
</p>

<p>Although the total volume of this literature is somewhat
daunting at first glance, a sampling of the material soon reveals
that much is repetitive and a relatively small number of papers
are continually referred to by most authors. Therefore, this
review will concentrate on a selective group of these articles
(90+), which represent the core of this research, but in doing
so, we proceed with a high degree of confidence in the
representative nature of those papers chosen for review and
critique. Nonetheless, no review can be assumed to be free of
bias and this one is no exception. The quality of much of this
literature reviewed, however, is confounded by the political and
social debate surrounding illicit drug use in general and
cannabis in particular. There seems to be few neutral parties in
the debate and some reports barely hide the prejudices which
drive for particular conclusions, no matter what the empirical
data appears to indicate.<br>
</p>

<p>In commenting on the problems of research into the effects of
cannabis on humans Jones (1980) states:<br>
</p>

<p>This large and rapidly growing literature demonstrates that
all relevant information on all effects of cannabis will probably
never be available. Because of the nature of science, usually
facts change as experience accumulates. As more people use any
drug for more time, as analytic instruments become more
sensitive, and as researchers ask more focused questions, new
facts appear and the significance of older facts is continually
revised (pp. 54-55).<br>
</p>

<p>And, we might add, the interpretation of these 'scientific
facts' appears to change with the changing political climate. <br>
</p>

<p>Of course, this growth of knowledge and evolving
interpretation of the empirical data can be seen in the alcohol
and cigarette literature as well. Like these two licit drugs, the
effects of cannabis must be taken in relation to its frequency of
usage and hence dose rate. Thus, it is still an issue of debate
whether the moderate use of alcohol, as claimed by some, is
beneficial to cardiovascular health. However, there is little
disagreement that intense, prolonged use of alcohol is
deleterious to both physical and psychological well being. In the
case of cannabis, on the other hand, no one appears to be able to
define what constitutes heavy use and in field research of
illicit users the results become highly uncertain because of the
inability of scientists to ascertain actual dose rates and hence
life-time intake of cannabinoids. This is due to the wide range
of concentrations of THC and related compounds in smoked
marijuana and differences of smoking habits from one individual
to another. A 'fifth' of single-malt whisky at a given percent
strength is a very precise amount of ethyl alcohol, but a
kilogram of marijuana can vary widely in its content of bioactive
and psychoactive compounds.<br>
</p>

<p>Further, when reading the scientific literature on the effects
of cannabis, it is important to put the emerging evidence into
perspective. Very often statements are made about the effects of
its use which, when taken out of context, appear to be somewhat
exaggerated in their supposed effect on human health. For
example, infant birth weight is considered an important indicator
of later rates of cognitive and psychological maturation and thus
taken to be a significant risk-factor in the use of any drug by
pregnant women. Some studies relate cannabis usage to reduced
birth weight, but neglect to put this finding in the context of
other, more commonly used substances such as tobacco, which cause
even greater effects on birth weights of the infants of using
mothers (Hill and Tennyson, 1986; Fried and O'Connell, 1987).<br>
</p>

<p>Behavioural studies also have attempted to address the issue
of the relative effect of cannabis, as compared to other licit
drugs such as alcohol, in performance tasks - particularly for
its effect on driving an automobile. One of the more recent of
these studies by Chesher et al (1985) concludes that
&quot;duration of impairment produced by all three drugs
(cannabis was taken in two ways) at the doses used was very
similar&quot; (p. 624). A report issued in February, 1990 by the
United States National Transportation Safety Board indicated that
12.8% of those involved in fatal truck accidents showed signs of
cannabis ingestion in post mortem examination (cited in Nahas and
Latour, 1992, p. 496). However, these published rates are usually
confounded by multiple use of psychoactive substances in the
majority of cases, particularly alcohol, which is believed to
increase the deleterious effects on behaviour and judgement
induced by cannabis alone. However, in an earlier and larger
study drivers using cannabis only were involved in only 2.2% of
recorded fatal accidents and Hollister (1988) concludes from the
data that &quot;at present, THC plays a relatively minor role in
fatal traffic accidents as compared with alcohol&quot; (p. 113).
Apart from the direct neuropsychological effects of both drugs,
the problems caused by alcohol and cannabis in relation to motor
vehicle accidents, in particular, are more due to the methods and
circumstances of their use by a minority of individuals rather
than the fact that these substances both cause, in the main,
reversible perceptuo-motor deficits.<br>
</p>

<p>As indicated in the opening remarks, this review of the
effects of cannabis on humans will not attempt to be exhaustive
and will be divided into two broad categories - physiological and
psychological. The physiological classification will include
discussions of effects on the cardio-pulmonary system,
teratogenicity and the central nervous system. The psychological
grouping, on the other hand, will discuss the relationship of
cannabis use to social adjustment, driving behaviour, toxic
psychoses and schizophrenia. Of course, the psychological and
neurological are inextricably intertwined, but for heuristic
purposes they will be kept separate, being cross-referenced only
where necessary.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>PHYSIOLOGICAL</b></font> </p>

<p>Since most cannabis users smoke either marijuana or hashish,
it is reasonable to examine the effect of smoking cannabis on the
occurrence of lung disease. Nahas (1984) reminds us that smoking
cannabis releases plant constituents such as tars, carbon
monoxide, acids, aldehydes, pyrobenzenes and particulate irritant
substances, so any toxilogical or pharmacological studies must
consider these by-products of smoking in addition to the
delta-9-THC content of the smoke, especially in the case of
chronic use. The reader should also take note that many reporters
on the effects of cannabis ingestion do not always make clear
conceptual discriminations between the effects of smoke
by-products (which are very similar to tobacco except for the
presence or absence of nicotine or THC) and those specifically
related to the pharmacology of THC. Of course, users primarily
smoke cannabis, but it can also be ingested orally giving similar
psychoactive effects. Thus, any reasonable discussion of the
physiological effects of cannabis must take into account that it
is illegally used primarily for its psychoactive properties and
if THC were to be provided in an easily ingested rapid acting
oral form, the problems due to smoking could be obviated. <br>
</p>

<p>When taken, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol rapidly disappears
from the blood plasma and is taken up in fat where it remains
with a half life decay rate of 5-7 days. This means that after a
single dose of THC, less than 1% of the primary active ingredient
remains in fatty tissue after approximately 35-50 days (Nahas,
1984). THC's oil solubility and thus high affinity for fatty
tissue probably accounts for its attraction to neural tissue with
its high lipid content in myelin and other components of the
neurone. Herkenham et al (1990) used quantitative autoradiography
to map the distribution of THC in mammalian brains in which they
demonstrated that:<br>
</p>

<p>...in all species very dense binding was found in the globus
pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the
molecular layers of the cerebellum and hippocampal dentate gyrus.
Dense binding was also found in the cerebral cortex, other parts
of the hippocampal formation, and striatum. In rat, rhesus
monkey, and human, the SNr contained the highest level of
binding. Neocortex in all species had moderate binding across
fields, with peaks in superficial and deep layers. Very low and
homogeneous binding characterised the thalamus and most of the
brainstem, including all of the monoamine-containing cell groups,
reticular formation, primary sensory, visceromotor and cranial
motor nuclei, and the area postrema. The
exceptionshypothalamus, basal amygdala, central gray, nucleus
of the solitary tract, and laminae I-III and X of the spinal
cordshowed slightly higher but still sparse binding (p. 1935).<br>
</p>

<p>They conclude that the structure activity profile defined by
the binding of the THC analogue used in the study is consistent
with &quot;the same receptor that mediates all of the behavioural
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids, ...including the
subjective experience termed the human 'high'&quot; (Herkenham et
al, 1990, p. 1935). These binding sites are also consistent with
THC's effects on loosening of associations, fragmentation of
thought and short-term memory deficits. Further, dense bindings
found in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggest a role for
cannabinoids in effecting motor control while involvement with
the ventromedial striatum suggests connections to dopamine
circuits. However, the expected reinforcing properties usually
associated with these dopamine pathways is difficult to
demonstrate in the case of THC. <br>
</p>

<p>There are over 60 other cannabinoids and cannabidiols present
in cannabis smoke, most of which have very little psychoactivity
and do not bind to these same sites. The effect of these
substances is largely unknown, nor is the level of psychoactivity
for any THC remaining in fatty tissue on the days subsequent to
the original ingestion known. Although, in the case of light to
moderate cannabis users, THC can be detected in body fluids for
approximately 30 days after the last consumption, it is quite
difficult to detect perceptuo-motor effects this long after a
given average single dose (1-3 mg THC in cannabis to be smoked).
This is unlike alcohol where a clear dose/response curve is
demonstrable in which effects of ethanol on behaviour and
judgement can be demonstrated at blood levels below 0.05%. In
their comparative study Chesher et al (1985) have estimated that
a dose of cannabis originally containing 1 to 2 mg THC produced a
decrement in performance on a battery of psychological tests
which was approximately the same as that produced by alcohol at a
concentration of 0.05% (at peak) (p. 627).<br>
</p>

<p>The results of this last study suggest that many of the
behavioural studies to be examined later in this paper may be
seriously flawed. The high dose rates of the typical chronic
cannabis user recruited for these behavioural studies, when taken
in the context of the relatively long half-life of THC, suggest
that behavioural and psychological tests conducted on chronic
users who are supposedly no longer using cannabis are, in fact,
being carried out on individuals still highly intoxicated. If, as
Chesher et al (1985) suggest, the ingestion of 1-2 mg of THC to
be smoked is the equivalent, in a behavioural sense, of achieving
a 0.05% blood alcohol, then typical dose rates of 150 mg per day
(to be smoked) are the intoxication equivalent of drinking more
than fifteen 10 oz schooners of standard beer per hour. Cannabis
users at this level of consumption will still have very
significant accumulations of THC in their fatty tissue, and hence
a serum equivalent of more than 0.05% blood alcohol, several
weeks after their last ingestion of cannabis. Thus, any studies
conducted to examine the permanent effects of THC on behaviour
for heavy cannabis users must be sure that their subject sample
has not used any cannabis whatsoever for several months prior to
examination. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PULMONARY EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>There have been a number of anecdotal reports and uncontrolled
clinical observations which link cannabis smoking to the risk of
pulmonary pathology (Cohen, 1986). However, this evidence is much
less conclusive than a controlled study of lung function tests
carried out by Tashkin and colleagues (1980) in which 74 habitual
cannabis smokers were compared to non-users. The results
indicated no substantive difference between users and non-users
but Cohen (1986) criticises these results as being skewed by the
fact that all the participants were initially screened and those
showing any respiratory pathology were removed from the study. In
addition, Tashkin et al's (1980) findings somewhat contradict
their earlier (1976) report in which they conclude that very
heavy marijuana smoking for 6 to 8 weeks appears to cause mild
but significant airway obstruction.<br>
</p>

<p>Earlier studies of U.S. servicemen hashish smokers conducted
by Henderson and Tennant (1972), however, make a more damaging
case against cannabis in relation to lung disorders. These
researchers found frequent and severe nose and throat
inflammation often accompanied by X-ray findings which included
sinusitis and lower airway diseases such as bronchitis and
asthma. As part of these studies patients with chronic cough were
subjected to bronchoscopy and biopsy of the epithelial lining of
the posterior wall of the trachea. Microscopic examination of the
biopsy samples revealed a number of cellular abnormalities which
are associated with the later development of lung cancer and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These include the loss of
cilia, basal epithelial cell proliferation and proliferation
atypical cells.<br>
</p>

<p>The authors acknowledge that most of these men smoked tobacco
along with hashish, but insist that the development of the
abnormalities observed significantly pre-dates their usual
appearance in those who are tobacco smokers only. The problem
with ascribing these pathological changes to cannabis alone is
obvious. The later attempts of Tennant and associates to
disconfound tobacco effects from those of cannabis tended to show
that either smoking tobacco alone or use of hashish on its own is
less deleterious than combining the two (Tennant, Guerry, and
Henderson, 1980). However, the sample size used in this later
study was much too small to allow any clear-cut conclusions to be
drawn. Cohen summarises these findings. <br>
</p>

<p>Although not a single case of lung cancer has yet been
attributed to chronic marijuana smoking in this country (U.S.),
the possibility cannot be ignored that chronic, heavy marijuana
smoking, like chronic tobacco smoking, may be a risk factor for
the development of lung cancer and that the risks of developing
lung cancer as the result of combined marijuana and tobacco
smoking could be additive or even synergistic (parentheses mine)
(Cohen, 1986, p. 156).<br>
</p>

<p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that cannabis produces
similar carcinogenic 'tars' to that of tobacco, but in greater
quantities than for an equal weight of tobacco, and the deep
inhalation techniques employed by marijuana and hashish smokers
tends to deposit that tar more deeply in the lungs. It has been
calculated that 70% of the particulate matter is retained in the
lungs and it thus can be assumed that in the case of cannabis
this percentage is even greater (Jones, 1980). Again, in
contrasting pulmonary effects of cannabis smoking with that of
tobacco it should be recalled that most tobacco smokers are now
using products which have been modified to reduce the 'tar'
content and which are often filtered to that same end. Therefore,
the comparison of illicit cannabis with legal, processed tobacco,
in terms of health effects, is somewhat spurious.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>When cannabis is first smoked one of its most prominent
immediate effects is tachycardia which tends to be proportional
to the ingested dose (Stimmel, 1979). The rate increase varies
from 50-100% of resting pulse with an accompanying decrease in
orthostatic blood pressure. It was observed by Aronow and Cassidy
that the consumption of one marijuana cigarette containing 19 mg
of THC decreased exercise time until angina by 48% as compared to
a marijuana placebo which only reduced time to angina by 9%. The
authors of this study concluded that cannabis smoking increased
myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing myocardial oxygen
delivery (Aronow and Cassidy, 1974). Hollister (1988) concludes
from these results that, although smoking is not recommended for
anyone with angina, the shorter time until angina seen with
cannabis combined with its induction of tachycardia makes it
particularly deleterious for those suffering from
arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries or congestive heart
failure. Nahas (1984) summarises what he believes to be the
cardiovascular threat of cannabis ingestion based on the above
findings:<br>
</p>

<p>The smoking of marihuana increases the work of the heart by
increasing heart rate, and in some cases by increasing blood
pressure. This increase in work load poses a threat to patients
with hypertension, cerebro-vascular disease, and coronary
atherosclerosis. <br>
</p>

<p>Marihuana can also cause postural hypotension. The drop in
blood pressure could be hazardous in those individuals with
compromised blood flow to heart or brain, especially if they are
volume-depleted or if other drugs have impaired reflex control of
their blood vessels. In older patients treated by delta-9-THC or
who had smoked marihuana for glaucoma, orthostatic hypotension
has been disabling and a risk factor of cardiovascular
complications. <br>
</p>

<p>Marihuana appears to intensify the effects of the sympathetic
nervous system on the heart, an undesirable consequence in
patients with coronary artery disease and in those susceptible to
arrythmias (p. 127).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) admits that distinguishing chronic from acute
effects of cannabis on the cardiovascular system is problematic.
Chronic, long term oral administration of THC can result in
mildly depressed heart rate and slight lowering of blood pressure
(Benowitz and Jones, 1975). Although these changes appear to be
of little biological significance, Jones feels that long term use
might be associated with lasting health consequences, drawing his
argument from the accumulated data now existent on tobacco use
and heart disease. It was, he argues, years before the connection
was made between smoking and coronary artery disease. Jones
claims that THC has &quot;far more profound effects on the
cardiovascular system than does nicotine,&quot; but fails to tell
us how. In fact, the findings of Benowitz and Jones he presents
on long term oral administration of THC (above) shows an effect
which could be construed as potentially useful in combating the
negative cardiovascular effects of long term stress. As is often
the case in THC research, interpretation is in the eye of the
beholder.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones' prediction concerning the effect of long term cannabis
use as having potentially more serious effects than nicotine
ingestion is somewhat peremptory. Until the effects of the
&quot;tars,&quot; particulates, carbon monoxide and differing
smoking styles involved in marijuana smoking are disconfounded
from the effects of the cannabinols (THC in particular),
prognostications about the future effects of cannabis on the
cardiovascular system are somewhat precipitous. His statement
comparing nicotine with THC is particularly ill founded. Most
studies have not looked at comparisons between THC and nicotine,
per se, but have made comparisons between smoked cannabis and
tobacco cigarettes. The actions of both compounds are no doubt
altered by the method of delivery (smoking) as well as by the
combination of responses caused by other constituents of the
smoke such as carbon monoxide, for example. Nicotine itself is
known to be a strong activator of sympathetic pathways of the
autonomic nervous system thereby having a direct, stimulating
effect on the heart (Kalat, 1988). No such direct action has been
demonstrated for THC or its other psychoactive derivatives. <br>
</p>

<p>Again, as in the case of possible pulmonary action of THC,
conjecture seems to far outweigh empirical evidence. What
evidence there is appears to be flawed by studies which are
either uncontrolled, anecdotal, or based on small, idiosyncratic
cases. Even more importantly, the research cited above does not
control for the effect of psychological factors on cardiovascular
activity. As will be described later in this paper, cannabis
intoxication is well known for producing mild to severe panic
reactions in naive users (Cohen, 1986; Hollister, 1988; Jones,
1980; Nahas, 1984; Weil, 1970). The level of stress produced by
such states, and by altered consciousness experiences in general,
often may be responsible for the clinical signs of stress
syndrome such as shortness of breath, tachycardia, etc. There is
little doubt that any individual with incipient cardiopathology
may show symptoms of cardiac distress when so psychologically
taxed.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>TERATOGENICITY<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Central to the issue of teratogenicity and THC is the
possibility that there is a direct action of the cannabinoids on
chromosomes. In studies by Stenchever, Kunysz, and Allen (1974)
and Herha and Obe (1974) a significant increase in chromosomal
abnormalities was observed in marijuana users as opposed to
non-users. These changes consisted largely of breaks or
translocations of chromosomes and more of the latter were found
in chronic users than non-users. However, when breaks were
included in the count, the effect was drowned and the differences
were lost. A later study, however, found that after 72 days of
chronic marijuana smoking, no increase in chromosomal breakage
rate could be found when compared to the base level existing
before the study (Hollister, 1988; Matsuyama, Jarvik, Fu, and
Yen, 1976). The pre-test, post-test design of this last study can
be considered superior to the previous two clinical
investigations because of the built-in controls of a
within-subject statistical design. Studies not using this
particular design usually cannot approximate the dose rate
received by their subjects nor are they able to rule out other
causes of chromosome anomalies, which may be related to
differences in life-style between users and non-users and/or the
effects of other drugs rather than being due to the action of THC
alone.<br>
</p>

<p>In addition, one must take any chromosome studies in the
proper context. Many commonly used licit drugs are capable of
causing chromosome abnormalities as well. For example, in a
recent in vitro study it was demonstrated that Paracetamol is
capable of producing concentration-dependent chromosomal
aberrations in primary rat hepatocytes (Muller, Kasper, and
Madle, 1991). Although these clastogenic effects in vitro were
observed only at very high concentrations, pharmacokinetic data
and other published mutagenicity data suggest that there might be
a risk for human use. According to the authors, in vivo studies
suggest Paracetamol is also weakly clastogenic in human
lymphocytes when used at the maximum human therapeutic dose
range. However, there appears to be no public alarm regarding
this and earlier studies which made similar observations about
the effects of aspirin. For both THC and Paracetamol the
long-term effects of induced chromosomal abnormalities remains
unknown and thus we must be cautious in extrapolating to any
possible teratogenic consequences without considerably more
controlled research.<br>
</p>

<p>One of the more contentious areas of cannabis research
concerns the effect on foetal development of the mother's use of
THC containing preparations during pregnancy. As Cohen (1986)
suggests, these effects can be highly confounded by other factors
such as nutrition, alcohol, tobacco, other drug use and
socioeconomic status. He further suggests that fairly large
numbers of matched-pair subject would be required for the
maintenance of external validity in such studies. Hingston et al
(1982) studied 1,690 mother/child pairs in which 234 mothers used
marijuana in varying amounts during the course of their
pregnancies. The outcome of this study revealed that cannabis use
was associated with lower infant birth weight and length for the
babies of users. This results revealed a proportional effect for
the level of consumption of THC, with higher use rates delivering
greater birth weight deficits. Zuckerman et al (1989) obtained
similar results in which they found a statistically significant
average 79 gram decrement in foetal weight and a 0.5 cm reduction
in body length for maternal THC users as opposed to non-users. In
this study they further raise the issue of the importance of
biological markers in differentiating users from non-users. When
analysing the results of their subjects on verbal reports alone,
the significant differences disappeared in contrast to a
differentiation made by urinanalysis for THC metabolites.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) states in his interpretation of the results of
Hingston et al (1982) that maternal marijuana use was the
strongest independent predictor of the occurrence of features
compatible with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and was better than
alcohol as a predictor of FAS. In a later study Hingston et al
(1984) clarified their earlier study and concluded that some
adverse effects attributed to maternal drinking and smoking may
be the result of an interaction with marijuana. In other words,
there may be an additive effect of drug combinations on the
foetus. <br>
</p>

<p>In a related study Gibson, Bayhurst, and Colley (1983) found
that, of the 7,301 births sampled for abnormal infant
characteristics, mothers using marijuana were significantly more
likely to deliver premature babies of low birth weight. However,
the largest study reported in Cohen's (1986) review of the
literature is that of Linn, Schoenbaum, Monson, Stubblefield, and
Ryan (1983). In this study 10 independent variables were analysed
for 12,718 women who gave birth at the Boston Hospital. Marijuana
was the most highly predictive of congenital malformation above
alcohol and tobacco. Further, Qazi et al (1985) studied the
infants of five regular marijuana only users and found that each
infant had low birth weight, small head circumference, tremors at
birth, abnormal epicanthic folds, posteriorly rotated ears, a
long philtrum, a high arched palate and abnormal palm creases
which are all considered signs of FAS. Cohen suggests the cause
of these morphological anomalies can be found in the results of
research conducted by Morishima (1984) in which he found that 5%
of ova are damaged by exposure to THC.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) admits that gross malformations in human infants
have not yet been conclusively linked to THC exposure. Fried
(1985), on the other hand, observed that any possible neonatal
nervous system effects occurring from the result of regular
marijuana use by mothers during pregnancy do not manifest in
poorer performance on cognitive and motor tests at one and one
half and two years of age. In addition, a later study by Fried
(1989) found that, by age three, a dose response relationship
between lower language scores, lowered cognitive scores and
prenatal cigarette (tobacco) exposure is observable. At this age,
some cognitive and language deficits are also observable with
prenatal marijuana exposure. In summary, although Fried observed
that at one, two and three years of age, there are persistent
effects of prenatal exposure to cigarettes, the effects of
prenatal marijuana exposure, if present, are not as readily
ascertained.<br>
</p>

<p>If, as noted in the introductory section of this paper,
neonatal weight, length and head circumference are critical
variables predictive of later psycho-motor development, there is
good reason for concern based on the results of most of the
studies cited above. However, Fried's (1985, 1989) work appears
to contradict the conventional wisdom in the case of the THC
users he studied vis-&#136;-vis reduction in foetal body size and
its relation to later learning and behavioural deficits. These
contradictory findings would tend to indicate either that the
research into birth effects is somewhat confounded, or there is
not a simple relationship between foetal body size and
behavioural development. Again, as in other areas of research
into the effects of THC on humans, the disentangling of these
issues awaits more exacting and controlled studies in the future
(Nahas and Latour, 1992). <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In many ways the existence or not of permanent, harmful
changes to the nervous system caused by the use of cannabis is
central to the debate on the drug's long-term effects. Obviously,
any substance which has definite psychoactivity must, ipso facto,
be neurologically active. That cannabis alters brain function
there is no doubt. The questions addressed by most research is
how and to what degree. Jones (1980) summarises the nature of
cannabis intoxication and its relation to neurological clinical
signs.<br>
</p>

<p>Acute cannabis intoxication includes not only the pleasant
state of relaxation, euphoria, and sought-after sensory
alterations, but also impairs judgments of distance and time,
memory for recent events, ability to learn new information, and
physical coordination. At slightly higher doses the acute
intoxication includes tremor, transient muscular rigidity, or
myoclonic muscle activity. The subjective feelings of muscular
&quot;weakness&quot; or stiffness can be measured objectively.
Low doses produce no changes in tendon reflexes, but high doses
cause hyperexcitability of knee jerks with clonus. At even higher
doses a full blown acute brain syndrome is possible (p. 67).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) goes on to add that some researchers would argue
that such altered and impaired brain function represents a prima
facie case of temporary neurological damage during the period of
acute intoxication. The health issue which arises from this is
whether these neurological alterations last only a few hours or
whether they persist with deleterious cumulative effects. As will
be seen below, the data is by no means consistent and conclusions
are difficult to draw.<br>
</p>

<p>In the early 1970's press reports appeared which claimed that
scientists had found that cannabis use caused 'shrinking of the
brain'. These claims were based on the work of Campbell (1971),
who used pneumoencephalography to examine a small sample (10) of
cannabis users by examining the size of their neural ventricles.
These measurements appeared to reveal that the ventricles were
enlarged, a finding consistent with cerebral atrophy. The problem
with this early research is that it was conducted on a population
of patients who were suffering from various neurological
disorders. This fact, together with the inaccuracy of the earlier
air-volume measurement technique, is deemed by Jones (1980) to
render the work invalid. Later, similar, small-scale studies
conducted by Co et al (1977) and Kuehnle et al (1977) using
computerised transaxial tomography (CAT scans) found no evidence
of anatomic changes. In the latter research the subjects were
preselected for being healthy, normal cannabis users. However,
these last two studies beg the research question by, in effect,
choosing subjects who have not yet developed any pathology for an
examination of possible permanent neurological effects of
cannabis use.<br>
</p>

<p>Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in humans using cannabis
usually entail an increase in mean-square alpha energy levels and
a slight slowing of alpha frequency. In general, only very minor
changes tend to appear in the surface EEG's of cannabis users and
those that do, such as increases in alpha wave activity, tend to
be synonymous with drowsiness and relaxation (Jones, 1980; Cohen,
1986; Klonoff, Low, and Marcus, 1973). Although scalp EEG changes
are minimal, Heath (1973) and Heath et al (1979) report
significant alterations in electrical activity recorded in
mid-brain structures of primates, most notably in the septal and
amygdala areas. Although the focal EEG changes reported in this
research have been seen only in the brains of monkeys which were
exposed to marijuana smoke or given THC intravenously, the
research of these authors has been quoted widely in both
scientific review articles as well as in various anti-cannabis
tracts. Therefore, a closer examination of some of this work is
in order.<br>
</p>

<p>Heath et al (1979) found that continuous, daily exposure to
the equivalent of the smoke from about 3 marijuana cigarettes per
day produced abnormal electrical alterations after 2 to 3 months.
Additional exposure of up to 3 to 6 months produced electrical
abnormalities which persisted for up to 8 months. Heath also
conducted histological examinations on brain tissue from the
monkeys and found anatomic changes were apparent in the
electronmicrographs, suggesting long-lasting changes related to
the THC exposure. These changes included widening of the synaptic
cleft, clumping of synaptic vesicles and other unspecified
changes in morphology of neurones which occurred in monkeys after
6 months of forced cannabis intake and were still evident 6
months after cessation of cannabis use. However, it is unclear
from his report whether a methodical evaluation of the supposed
histopathology was made which included an independent panel of
judges or whether these were his own personal judgements. <br>
</p>

<p>The deep sites from which abnormal EEG recordings were
recorded are generally believed to be involved in emotional
expression and hence affect disorders.2 Heath's earlier work
remains somewhat problematic when his experimental setup is
examined in more detail. Although his monkeys included controls
who were exposed to both very low THC containing marijuana and
tobacco smoke alone,3 this research remains highly confounded.
The monkeys were strapped into chairs with transparent, sealed
plastic boxes surrounding their heads. The smoke, together with
oxygen, was pumped into the box for a pre-determined period while
EEG recordings were made through permanently implanted deep
electrodes. Given that in humans THC can induce panic anxiety
attacks and given that monkeys do not like to be restrained, it
is impossible to tell whether the abnormal electrical activity
recorded in limbic areas was directly induced in the brain by the
action of THC or whether this activity was what one would observe
when panic is induced in restrained monkeys intoxicated by THC.<br>
</p>

<p>Heath describes the monkeys' behaviour.<br>
</p>

<p>All displayed dilated pupils and sharp reduction in level of
awareness. The monkeys would stare blankly into space, sometimes
displaying spontaneous nystagmus, and would become much less
attentive or completely unresponsive to environmental stimuli.
When their hands or feet were grasped, the clasping response,
which was consistently elicited on baseline examinations, was
absent. Responses to pain (pinprick) and to sound (hand claps)
were minimal to absent. Although the monkeys were not
particularly drowsy, spontaneous motor movements were notably
slowed, and passive tests of muscle tone suggested a degree of
catatonia, although true waxy flexibility never developed (Heath,
1973, p. 4).<br>
</p>

<p>This certainly is not the way that the vast majority of human
beings react to cannabis intoxication. The behaviour Heath
describes appears to be more in line with an animal frozen in
panic or manifesting what used to be called 'animal hypnosis'.
Hunt (1984), a cognitive psychologist, has called this the
&quot;negative capability&quot; and it appears to be part of a
neurophysiological mechanism for behavioural and cognitive
shutdown when an animal is overwhelmed by, for example, a
predator.<br>
</p>

<p>Another major problem with Heath's 1973 study was the control
of O2 partial pressure (PP) in the head chamber. From tables in
his paper one can see that the PP of O2 inside the monkey's
&quot;breathing chamber&quot; was 75% greater than room PP in the
marijuana run but only 9% above for the control tobacco sequence.
The measured serum PP of O2 was 143% above pre-exposure levels as
seen in his data for the marijuana sequence as opposed to a rise
of only 22.4% in the case of the tobacco run. There is little
doubt that high partial pressures of serum O2 will affect brain
function and hence the EEG recordings (p. 9). Thus, any
comparisons between THC exposure and tobacco exposure in this
study are at best spurious. Finally, Heath states that, as the
choice of subjects for cannabis studies moves up the phylogenetic
scale, it is observed that THC produces a more localised effect
in the brain involving fewer areas. In other words, humans show
the least generalised reactions to THC. In summary, apart from
the confounding factors of behavioural variables and O2 partial
pressures in this research, any attempt to generalise from
monkeys to humans is fraught with the possibility of committing a
logical category error.<br>
</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the research of Heath and his colleagues
has been widely reported and appears to have been accepted
somewhat uncritically by a number of serious researchers as seen
in two of the review articles being reported on here (Cohen,
1986; Jones, 1980). This seems to be a recurring theme in much of
the cannabis research today. In most research into
psychopharmacological effects on EEG reliable conclusions are
rarely drawn from so small a number of studies. The interaction
of pharmacological agents with brain and behaviour is complex and
even the simplest relationships require many experiments in order
to delineate the causal connections with any degree of
reliability. It appears as though any findings in cannabis
research are immediately set upon by the those opposed to it use
for the purpose of adding power to already pre-drawn conclusions.<br>
</p>

<p>Sleep EEG recordings sometimes can be more sensitive
indicators of drug effects than waking EEG (Jonew, 1980).
Reduction in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep accompanied by
increases in total sleep time have been reported in humans
together with considerable changes in surface EEG recordings as
effects of cannabis use (Feinberg , 1976). The cessation of
cannabis intake after prolonged use will then lead to a rebound
effect in which REM sleep stages and eye movements rise above
baseline levels. This rebound is not unlike those seen after the
cessation of other sedative hypnotic drugs. In addition to these
EEG changes, cortically evoked potentials consistent with altered
central nervous system (CNS) function have been recorded from
scalp electrodes of waking subjects (Herning, Jones, and
Peltzman, 1979). However, as is often the case in cannabis
research, &quot;the pattern of change varies with dose and
measurement technique, and between laboratories. The biological
or functional significance of these alterations remains
obscure&quot; (Jones, 1980, p. 69).<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) summarises the difficulties and uncertainty which
must be accepted as part of cannabis research into its
neurological effects.<br>
</p>

<p>Many survey and laboratory studies comparing user and nonuser
populations have reported no differences in cognitive,
intellectual, or perceptual function between these two
groups....Many of the studies reporting no neurological
differences between users and nonusers have compared very
selected people using 1, 2, or 3 marijuana cigarettes per week to
those using none. It may well be that lasting impairment will be
evident only at a greater dosage level or that the marijuana use
interacts with some other unrecognised factor to produce lasting
effects. The impairment will thus be missed in such limited
studies. On the other hand, when deleterious, possibly
marijuana-related, effects on function have been noted in groups
of cannabis users, it is very difficult to determine whether the
cannabis use caused the impairment, or was simply associated with
it, or followed it.<br>
</p>

<p>If one considers neurochemical data from test tubes, animal
data, clinical case reports, survey data, controlled laboratory
data, and semicontrolled field studies, the weight of the
evidence so far is that lasting neuropsychological impairments
are possibly but not inevitably associated with some undetermined
level of heavy, prolonged cannabis use. However, the many factors
that would determine the appearance of clinically evident
cannabis-induced neuropsychological changes in any given user are
so complex as to make any simple pronouncement of risk almost
meaningless (pp. 70-71).<br>
</p>

<p>The research paradoxes revealed in the above section on
physiological effects of cannabis can only be adequately resolved
through the application of controlled experimental research
techniques on large groups of humans. It is obvious that this is
neither ethical nor practical. Of course, the tautological trap
created by subject choice, as described in most of the above
clinical research into cannabis, applies to all epidemiological
studies, not just cannabis research. As we have seen with both
tobacco and alcohol research in the past, reliable conclusions
can only be pieced together slowly through large-scale and
methodical data collection. So, it must be recognised that
decisions probably cannot wait for the final datum to be
collected because it is unlikely that all the data will ever be
'in'.<br>
</p>

<p>As with many decisions in other aspects of life, we must
examine the apparent 'facts', while attempting to understand
their context and accuracy, and then make the best possible
choice based on the pragmatics of the circumstances rather than
on absolutist principles posing as facts. One might well argue
that if there is any doubt, whatsoever, that cannabis is safe to
use, then it should be permanently banned. However, there may be
useful social purposes served by allowing controlled use of
cannabis which outweigh any possible deleterious effects it may
have on the human organism. This is obviously the kind of
thinking behind the current freedom we have to use analgesics,
such as aspirin and Paracetamol, in spite of their well
documented negative side-effects.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><b>PSYCHOLOGICAL<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In any review of the psychological effects of cannabis, a
clear distinction should be drawn between cannabis use, abuse and
dependency. Because of the problems involved in determining
potency, as delineated in the opening section of this paper, it
is often difficult to distinguish casual users from those who are
abusers or dependent on the drug. The standard reference for
differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association
(1987), defines cannabis dependence.<br>
</p>

<p>Cannabis Dependence is usually characterised by daily, or
almost daily, use of the substance. In Cannabis Abuse, the person
uses the substance episodically, but shows evidence of
maladaptive behaviour, such as driving while impaired by Cannabis
Intoxication (p. 176).<br>
</p>

<p>The DSM-IIIR asserts that the impairment of occupational and
social functioning and the resultant physical pathologies
associated with cannabis dependence tend to be less than those
seen in other psychoactive intoxicants, such as heroin, cocaine
and alcohol. As a result, people showing signs of cannabis abuse
or dependency are less often seen by medical doctors and
psychiatrists. This fact further clouds any attempts at
delineating an accurate definition or symptomatology of cannabis
abuse and/or dependency. <br>
</p>

<p>The Manual does list a set of general symptoms characteristic
of dependency, however. These include lethargy, anhedonia, and
attentional and memory problems. This dependency syndrome usually
develops with repeated use over a considerable period of time
with rapid development following initial use being rare. Although
there has been considerable debate over the issue of the
development of tolerance in cannabis users, the DSM-IIIR asserts
that &quot;tolerance may develop to some of the substance's
psychoactive effects and thus promote increased levels of
consumption&quot; (p. 177). This increase is not very great,
according to the Manual, and if levels of consumption become very
high, there may be a decrease in pleasurable effects with a
concomitant increase in the number of dysphoric effects
experienced by users. Jones (1980) summarises. <br>
</p>

<p>Tolerance, that is, a diminished response to a repeated
cannabis dose, is clearly associated with repeated use...It
appears now, both in animals and in humans, that tolerance
develops quite rapidly to many of the effects of THC. The more
frequent the administration and the higher the dose the more
rapidly it develops, but even subjects smoking as little as one
marijuana cigarette per day in a laboratory experiment
demonstrate tolerance on some behavioural and physiologic
dimensions when they are carefully measured....Most of the
tolerance seems to be lost rapidly, but this rate may vary with
the sensitivity of the measures used (p. 74).<br>
</p>

<p>Other researchers, on the other hand, argue from both clinical
and personal experience that one must learn to get 'high' and,
therefore, it takes less cannabis for experienced users to obtain
the desired effect than for neophytes (Tart, 1971; Weil, 1975).
However, Weller, Halikas, and Moorse (1984) found, in a five-year
follow-up study of regular marijuana users, that continuous use
was associated with decreasing pleasurable effects. Cohen (1986)
summarises their results.<br>
</p>

<p>Users who had earlier reported positive feelings of
relaxation, peacefulness, enhanced sensitivity, floating
sensations, self-confidence, subjective impressions of heightened
mental power, and other sought-after effects now said that these
effects had significantly diminished. The undesirable aspects of
the experience, however, persisted essentially unchanged (p.
158).<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PSYCHOPATHOLOGY<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Nahas (1984), a major contributor to the cannabis literature,
takes a strongly proscriptive stand towards cannabis use and
underscores the potential psychological dangers inherent in
cannabis intoxication when he argues that exposure during the key
developmental periods of foetal growth and adolescence may
produce long-term, permanent psychopathological changes in
individuals thus exposed. In order to further emphasise the
allegedly unseen threat of cannabis use, Brill and Nahas (1984)
address the issue of the paradox of the apparent minimal
physiological effects recorded in most cannabis users warning us
that<br>
</p>

<p>The discrepancy between the marked psychological alterations
and the slight physical symptoms associated with Cannabis
intoxication represents another aspect of its deceptive nature.
Many people today believe that since no apparent gross physical
damage results from the absorption of Cannabis derivatives, there
is little or no danger associated with their use. They are
mistaken: Cannabis and all other hallucinogens have a common
characteristic, their psychotoxicity and their ability to
disintegrate mental function, which is not accompanied by any
major alterations of the vital physiological functions. Mental
illness, especially in the young, is also characterised by a
similar discrepancy between the functions of the mind, which are
markedly impaired, and those of the body, which are well
preserved (p. 263).<br>
</p>

<p>This strongly held position, only loosely based on empirical
data, often characterises the quality of discussion seen in the
research literature concerning the psychological effects of
cannabis. In the work of Brill and Nahas (1984) the unclear
relationship between the physiological cause and psychological
effect of cannabis intoxication is used to insinuate an almost
'devious' and/or 'sneaky' action for -9-tetrahydrocannabinol.
On the other hand, the actual argument given in the last section
of the above quote, aimed at establishing a potent relationship
between the minimal physiological causes arising from cannabis
ingestion and its apparent strong psychological effects, is,
again, typical of the cannabis debate and, in this case, spurious
on at least two counts.<br>
</p>

<p>The first is the obvious logical category error of arguing
from the class of mental illness to the psychological effects of
cannabis intoxication without any evidence that these two
phenomena are in any way the same category of event,
physiologically or psychologically. The second, the argument as
to the universality of deleterious psychological consequences of
cannabis use, is based on a small minority of cases who have
demonstrated some psychopathological effects directly
attributable to cannabis use and thus have come to the attention
of medical authorities. However, it should be remembered that the
vast majority of users, whether occasionally experiencing some
negative states or not, manage the use of cannabis and are able
to integrate it into productive life-styles without developing
any apparent psychopathology (Weil, 1975). The size of this
majority is in the many millions whereas the minority from which
most of the pathological data is drawn is a non-representative
(statistically) few hundred.<br>
</p>

<p>In contrast to the view of cannabis as psychologically
dangerous in itself, Weil (1975) has argued that it should be
understood to be what he calls an &quot;active placebo.&quot;
Weil describes an &quot;active placebo&quot; as &quot;a substance
whose apparent effects on the mind are actually placebo effects
in response to minimal physiological action&quot; rather than
being a direct cause of the psychological changes seen in users
(p. 95). This effect is attested to, empirically, by the wide
variety of responses individuals make to similar batches of
cannabis in similar situations. Weil's conclusions, based on
hundreds of clinical observations, led him to argue that it was
highly unlikely that cannabis alone could be responsible for the
very varied psychological responses and effects which he
observed. <br>
</p>

<p>From the recent work of Herkenham et al (1990), cited earlier
in this paper, there is no doubt that the cannabinols have
affinities for specific brain structures. However, it is as yet
unclear as to whether cannabis has any predictable specific
behavioural, cognitive, and/or affective effects resulting from
the particular receptor site bindings mapped in their study. To
date it is not possible to describe a unique and repeatable
constellation of psychological responses to the action of the
cannabinols as is possible for the opiate derivatives or the
neuroleptic compounds used in the treatment of schizophrenia.
This observation alone must cast some considerable doubt on most
psychopharmacological ascriptions made for the actions of the
cannabinols in humans. <br>
</p>

<p>There have been numerous attributions made about the
psychological effects of cannabis. In the sections below a number
of areas which have had considerable attention in the research
literature will be reviewed. However, before embarking on issues,
such as &quot;panic reaction&quot; and &quot;toxic
psychosis&quot; amongst cannabis users, at least one popular
misconception concerning cannabis intoxication requires
clarification.<br>
</p>

<p>As a result of press and electronic media coverage there is a
widely held belief by the community-at-large that those
intoxicated by cannabis are more prone to show aggressive and
violent behaviour. This idea also has found its way into
scientific discourse (Brill and Nahas, 1984; Imade and Ebie,
1991). In their exploration of this issue, Brill and Nahas
attempt to distil a phenomenology of cannabis intoxication based,
to a large extent, on the idiosyncratic reportage of
Jacques-Joseph Moreau who recorded observations about himself and
other hashish users in the mid-Nineteenth Century. Moreau
describes the quality of affect experienced during the mood
swings he encountered while intoxicated on hashish.<br>
</p>

<p>With hashish, the emotions display the same degree of
overexcitement as the intellectual faculties. They have the
mobility and also the despotism of the ideas. The more one feels
incapable of directing his thoughts, the more one loses the power
to resist the emotions they create. The violence of these
emotions is boundless when the disorder of the intellect has
reached the point of incoherence (Brill and Nahas, 1984, p. 270).<br>
</p>

<p>Not only is this description contexualised in Nineteenth
Century cultural values and convictions, and thus not applicable
as a direct comparison with late Twentieth Century experience,
but the language itself is not easily interpretable from current
contexts. The culturally embedded beliefs regarding the nature of
emotions and mind have changed radically since Moreau's time as
have the way individuals understand their relationship with their
subjective lives. Therefore, using such a source in order to
understand cannabis intoxication in the present is dubious at
best. Claims concerning violence thus appear to be somewhat
confounded and in summarising this issue Jones (1980) reports
that<br>
</p>

<p>Most commissions and review groups that have specifically
studied the relationship between cannabis and violence have
concluded that the use of marijuana is not a major cause of
aggression. There is little new that would change that conclusion
(p. 73). <br>
</p>

<p>In fact, it is most often the case that chronic cannabis users
have a depressed demeanour, a lack of drive and rarely show signs
of violent behaviour (Tennant and Groesbeck, 1972). In contrast
to the myth of 'hashishim' running amok, is the often witnessed
syndrome referred to as &quot;panic reaction&quot;, which has
likely been confused with aggression and violence in many cases. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>PANIC REACTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>One of the most common dysphoric responses to cannabis
intoxication is what has been called the &quot;panic
reaction.&quot; &quot;Panic reaction&quot; most often appears as
part of an anxiety reaction in relatively inexperienced users, or
in those ingesting a higher than expected dose, and is
characterised by the appearance of an acute fear reaction
sometimes associated with panic connected to the experient's
possible, imminent death (Tennant and Groesbeck, 1972). This
&quot;panic reaction&quot; typically follows or is followed by an
acute paranoid state characterised by mistrust of others and a
belief that others have malintent towards the intoxicant. These
reactions are generally acute and disappear with the loss of
intoxication within hours (Cohen, 1986; Hollister, 1988).<br>
</p>

<p>Of this acute panic syndrome, Jones (1980) delineates the
possible psychological progression.<br>
</p>

<p>This reaction, which usually starts off with an exaggeration
of normal cannabis effects, can range from mild anxiety and
restlessness to panic with paranoid delusions, to a full-blown
acute toxic psychosis with loss of contact with reality,
delusions, hallucinations, and agitated and inappropriate
behaviour. The reaction is more likely to occur in inexperienced
users or in the user who unknowingly consumes more potent
cannabis material than is anticipated. Preexisting psychological
difficulties may also contribute. The symptoms usually diminish
over a few hours and are somewhat alleviated by reassurance, a
quiet environment, and generally supportive atmosphere (p. 71). <br>
</p>

<p>Kolansky and Moore (1971) studied a group of 38 subjects who
had smoked marihuana twice per week or more, consuming two or
more marijuana cigarettes per session. They found that their
subjects consistently demonstrated poor &quot;social
judgement&quot;, poor &quot;attention span&quot;, poor
concentration associated with confusion, anxiety, depression,
apathy, passivity and indifference. These changes appeared to be
part of an alteration of consciousness characterised by: 1) a
bifurcation of the ego into observing and experiencing selves; 2)
an apparent inability of the subjects to bring their thoughts
together; 3) a paranoid suspiciousness of others; and 4) a
seeming regression to a more infantile state (p. 487). They
summarise using a mixture of psychoanalytic and physiological
metaphors, which appear to owe more to speculation than to good
scientific inference.<br>
</p>

<p>It was our impression in these cases that the use of cannabis
derivatives caused such severe decompensation of the ego that it
became necessary for the ego to develop a delusional system in an
attempt to restore a new form of reality. It would appear that
this type of paranoid reaction is a direct result of the toxic
effects of cannabis upon the ego organisation of those patients
described in this study (p. 489).<br>
</p>

<p>However, in this paper Kolansky and Moore (1971) appear to
indulge in generalisations concerning the effects of THC which
are based on a tiny, psychiatrically referred sample. Any
conclusions thus drawn concerning the action of cannabis on the
general population commit the logical error of inferring a
universal from an existential instantiation. In addition, value
judgements are made about their patients throughout which reflect
a strong cultural bias in favour of American middle-class
professional standards. <br>
</p>

<p>There was marked interference with personal cleanliness,
grooming, dressing, and study habits or work or both. These
latter characteristics were at times present in some patients
prior to smoking marihuana, but were always markedly accentuated
following the onset of smoking (pp. 487-488).<br>
</p>

<p>There seems to be little introspective awareness on the part
of the authors regarding their strong prejudices and value
judgements. If science is supposed to be a value-free activity,
then this current report does not begin to represent science in
either spirit or praxis. These two psychiatrists appear to be
blissfully unaware of the cultural changes taking place around
them at the time (1968 - 1971) and thus much of their criticism
is confounded by their cultural blinkeredness. Further, the
appearance of opposite and contradictory symptomologies (some
became apathetic while other became hyperactive) in their study
group suggests that THC is not a strictly a causal agent of the
observed psychopathology, as argued by Weil (1975), but, rather,
a facilitator of predisposed conditions.<br>
</p>

<p>Negrete et al (1986) offers a conceptual description of what
might be the underlying psychological mechanisms of the panic,
ego decompensation and paranoid ideation sometimes seen in
cannabis users. He states that it has been<br>
</p>

<p>...observed that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) impairs the rate,
sequence and goal directness of thinking; that under the
influence of cannabis the individual experiences an intermittent
loss of information; that the feed-back and feed-forward
perceptive mechanisms - which are essential in the process of
reality testing - are upset. In addition, there is a distortion
in the sense of time which leads to a telescoping of past,
present and future. Unrelated events become peculiarly connected
in the user's own 'psychological time'. All these phenomena
foster projection and stimulate paranoid ideation (pp. 515-516).<br>
</p>

<p>Therefore, the evidence that new or inexperienced cannabis
users are prone to panic, paranoid, or anxiety attacks must be
seen from the perspective of this effect being largely a function
of particular personality types (psychological 'set') and the
quality of the 'setting' in which these personalities find
themselves when intoxicated. Any substance or situation which is
capable of facilitating (directly or as an &quot;active
placebo&quot;) a fairly radical change in cognitive sequencing
and affective states and, hence, an individual's relationship to
and understanding of social reality, has the potential of
generating panic, anxiety and paranoid states as a response to
loss of control and attendant feelings of uncertainty. No doubt
this is a danger in the use of cannabis as well as being a danger
when one leaves home for the first time, marries, gives birth for
the first time, or starts a new job.<br>
</p>

<p>When this type of psychological response does occur, there is,
of course, a real possibility of it escalating into a fully
fledged psychotic reaction. The literature on cannabis is, in
fact, replete with cases and discussions of the relationship of
cannabis use and abuse to the formation of toxic psychoses, a
subject to which we will now turn.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>CANNABIS TOXIC PSYCHOSIS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>In 1944 the New York La Guardia study concluded that given a
suitably oriented personality, marijuana use could lead, in the
right time and environment, to a true psychotic state.4 Even
earlier, however, a physician from British Guyana in 1893
described the symptoms of what he believed to be a cannabis
psychosis. <br>
</p>

<p>The cannabis psychosis gives the impression of acute mania or
melancholia. Most often the patient is in a state of mania,
suffering from delusions and visual and auditory hallucinations.
He moves incessantly, waving his arms, throwing himself from one
side to another, running up and down in the room, crying and
singing. The psychosis might be associated with violent
behaviour. Sometimes the patient refuses to eat, sometimes he
gets an intense hunger. The state may change rapidly and very
soon the patient will recover and seem quite normal again. - But
after two or three recurrences, every time triggered by relapses
into cannabis abuse, the patient runs the risk of becoming
apathetic and blunt. The cases of melancholia triggered by
cannabis abuse are more rare. I have, however, observed such
cases where the patients have become deeply depressed - to the
limit of committing suicide (Tunving, 1985, p. 209).<br>
</p>

<p>Imade and Ebie (1991), working in Nigeria, assert that
cannabis psychosis &quot;has gained recognition as a nosological
entity&quot; (p. 134). According to these authors cannabis
psychosis is categorised by the ICD-9 and DSM-III as either a
form of drug dependence or an induced organic mental disorder.
The diagnostic criteria given include intoxication marked by
delusional disorder. The delusional behaviour appears to be
caused solely by the ingestion of cannabis and persists for about
2 - 3 hours. Both social and occupational functioning are claimed
to show impairment and these reactions, argue Imade and Ebie,
&quot;vary according to the socioeconomic class, personality and
attitude of the users&quot; (p. 134).<br>
</p>

<p>These authors claim that members of lower socioeconomic
classes derive feelings of power and self-engrandisement from
cannabis use whereas members of the higher status classes
perceive cannabis as a relaxant and thus take it to achieve
greater calm. In contrast to Imade's and Ebie's position, Brill
and Nahas (1984) maintain that &quot;at the present time there
seems to be insufficient evidence to state that a purely
cannabis-induced psychosis exists as a separate clinical
entity&quot; (p. 294). However, the latter two authors do argue
strongly that cannabis is psycho-toxic and may precipitate a
psychotic reaction.<br>
</p>

<p>Whether or not the dysphoric, psychotic-like response of some
cannabis users is a &quot;nosological entity&quot;, the work of
the Nigerian researchers may be over-generalising from the
special conditions of their cultural and economic circumstances
since there do not appear to be similar sociodemographic
differences in response to cannabis reported by researchers in
economically more developed countries. In fact, Brill and Nahas
(1984) point out that most reports of 'cannabis psychosis' have
their origins in the Third World which may reflect a special
vulnerability of those people to any toxic substance due to
malnutrition with its attendant low body fat and plasma protein
concentration in affected individuals.<br>
</p>

<p>In addition to the cultural, social and economic mismatches of
many reports concerning cannabis induced psychosis, the problem
with most of the data reported in these studies is that they are
highly confounded and hence not scientifically sound. There is
rarely any clear, clinical data on the psychiatric condition of
these individuals pre-dating their cannabis 'psychosis' and,
hence, no way of assigning cause or any other relationship
between use and psychopathology. In addition, the age range in
most of these studies is that of young adults which is a common
time for the onset of psychotic disorders for non-drug takers as
well. <br>
</p>

<p>Thornicroft (1990) summarises the possible relationships which
may exist between psychosis and cannabis use.<br>
</p>

<p>Previous reviews of the possible association between cannabis
and psychosis have proposed six types of association. Cannabis
may cause psychoses de novo. It may reveal a previously latent
psychosis. Cannabis may precipitate a relapse of a pre-existing
psychosis. Established psychotic mental disorder may lead to an
increased intake of cannabis. There may be a spurious
relationship. Finally, there may be no relationship between
psychosis and cannabis. <br>
</p>

<p>These views have, however, failed to make three vital
distinctions. Firstly, they have not adequately separated organic
from functional psychotic reactions to cannabis. Secondly, they
have insufficiently discriminated between psychotic symptoms and
the syndromes of psychosis. Thirdly, they have not balanced the
weight of evidence for and against the category of 'cannabis
psychosis' (p. 25). <br>
</p>

<p>Further, the symptomatology of the hypothesised 'cannabis
psychosis' is very varied and often contradictory, indicating a
lack of a true and coherent constellation of symptoms one would
expect with an actual definable disorder. The only consistent set
of responses appears to be those associated with any toxic brain
syndrome whether caused by cannabis or any other neurologically
active substance (DSM-IIIR; Weil, 1975). This lack of specificity
is underscored by the following sample of symptom constellations
given by various modern cannabis researchers including: a)
shyness, irritability, hypersensitivity and arrogance with
chronic cannabis users being more often alienated from the
environment and indulging in day dreams (Stringaris, a Greek
psychiatrist described in Tunving [1985]); b) loss of contact
with reality, delusions, and hallucinations as well as agitated
and inappropriate behaviour (Jones, 1980); c) depression and
agitation (Cohen, 1986); d) the occurrence of extravagant ideas
such as being 'ageless' (Brill and Nahas, 1984);5 e) the delirium
similar to that of high fever (in its acute toxic phase) which
includes confusion, prostration, disorientation, derealisation,
and, at times, auditory and visual hallucinations (Brill and
Nahas); and f) paranoia and depersonalisation occurring in a
manner indistinguishable from acute brain syndrome and a belief
on the part of the subject that s/he is going mad in spite of
remaining oriented with unimpaired consciousness (Kaplan, 1971).
The above group of symptoms taken with the descriptions given
earlier could, in fact, constitute a wide range of conditions
ranging from severe anxiety neurosis to true psychotic bipolar
affect disorder.<br>
</p>

<p>Thacore and Shukla (1976) indicate that patients with
'cannabis psychosis' show panicky and violent behaviour with
greater frequency, but they do &quot;not consider this behaviour
psychotic, because reality contact is maintained&quot; (p. 385).
Further, from my own clinical and personal observations it often
appears that many users who are having extreme dysphoric
reactions are suffering from the fear of 'going crazy' rather
than actually becoming truly psychotic. Thus, it is possible to
interpret many of the so-called psychotic responses to cannabis
use as extreme panic reactions which have escalated out of
control. The force of this argument derives from the fact that a)
the vast majority of these cases recover fully when the acute
phase of intoxication is past and b) interpersonal support during
this process is most often positively and constructively received
by the victim in a non-psychotic manner, viz., consciousness is
unimpaired thus allowing self-reflection and understanding in
rational and non-delusional ways.<br>
</p>

<p>Individuals suffering from clinically diagnosed organic or
psychodynamically identifiable psychoses do not respond in this
manner. The acute phase of psychosis, for the majority of cases,
moves into a chronic phase with life-long consequences. With
these psychotics the clinician finds it almost impossible to
penetrate the patient's delusional, referential thought process
and, similarly, positive support appears not to be capable of
penetrating the psychotic's world when in this acute phase. This
is not to say that such a psychotic episode never happens in
association with cannabis. However, it has not been possible, to
date, to disconfound the role of cannabis as a conceivable
facilitator of psychosis from its other possible roles as
self-medication used to treat an impending psychosis or its
coincidental use as part of a syndrome of disturbed behaviour in
an already troubled individual.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) suggests that the toxic psychotic-like reaction
sometimes associated with cannabis intoxication is often caused
by unexpectedly high doses in experienced users, the reaction to
intoxication by neophyte users, and/or the response of
individuals with a pre-existing psychopathology. It has been
observed that this &quot;toxic&quot; response is not consistent
with cannabis type or potency suggesting no direct, predictable
pharmacological link. He summarises the overall state of research
into 'cannabis psychosis'.<br>
</p>

<p>As is often the case with clinical reports, studies describing
cannabis psychosis rarely present data in a way that would
withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny. A number of reports
finding no evidence of links between cannabis use and psychoses
unfortunately have the same methodologic problems as studies
claiming drug-related associations, making it very difficult to
draw unequivocal conclusions (p. 72).<br>
</p>

<p>Moreau, in his mid-Nineteenth Century writings, seems to
recognise that there is a difference between delusional psychosis
and &quot;hashish fantasy&quot; which suggests that researchers,
today, may have to delineate, with some precision, this
difference before any definable and consistent 'nosology' of
extreme cannabis dysphoria can be found. One possible suggestion
is that there is no such clinical entity as a 'cannabis
psychosis' but, rather, a series of fear and panic reactions
which sometimes achieve the intensity of a psychotic-like state.
This extreme but temporary response should be understood more as
a result of the user's inability to cope with the cognitive and
affective reorganisation caused by THC rather than as a direct
and permanent &quot;poisoning&quot; of the CNS leading to a
permanent psychosis.<br>
<br>

<p><font size="4"><b>SCHIZOPHRENIA<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>There have been a number of studies which make a connection
between cannabis and schizophrenia. As in the case of reports on
toxic psychosis and cannabis, the relationship between cannabis
use and onset of pathology is unclear. Again, cause and effect
are difficult to establish because of the fact that most cases
studied are the result of psychiatric referrals from which only
post hoc attributions can be made.<br>
</p>

<p>In one of the very few longitudinal studies of cannabis and
psychopathology designed to disconfound the aetiology of
schizophrenia in relation to cannabis use Andreasson et al (1987)
studied Swedish military conscripts. Commencing in 1969-70 this
investigation used a pre/post research design, which, in its
first stage, included obtaining a history of drug use, social
background, psychiatric history, a current psychological
assessment and, where necessary, a psychiatric interview. In
their current paper, reviewing follow-up assessment made fifteen
years later, Andreasson et al state that, in addition to cannabis
consumption, increased occurrence of schizophrenia in the
conscripts was strongly correlated with diagnosis of psychiatric
disease other than schizophrenia at the time of conscription;
indicators of a disturbed childhood; abuse of solvents; and poor
adjustment at school. However, in this study no relationship was
observed between the increase in schizophrenic occurrences and
alcohol consumption, smoking, or socioeconomics.<br>
</p>

<p>Although the authors suggest that the association of cannabis
usage with schizophrenic onset may possibly be a result of an
&quot;emerging schizophrenia&quot;, they argue for the
interpretation that cannabis is a likely a precipitating factor
in schizophrenic onset for &quot;vulnerable&quot; individuals.
This conclusion was drawn as a result of the observation of an
increasing risk for development of schizophrenia being associated
with increasing cannabis consumption in individuals with previous
psychiatric symptoms. For the authors, this conclusion is
underscored with the additional finding that conscripts with no
psychiatric symptoms initially also demonstrate an increased risk
of schizophrenia with increasing cannabis consumption. In
conclusion, Andreasson et al (1987) state<br>
</p>

<p>...an individual might be vulnerable to schizophrenia but not
get the disease unless it is triggered by some life-event
stressor. The findings in this study suggest that cannabis may be
such a stressor. The effect of cannabis on the central nervous
system support this hypothesis (p. 1485).<br>
</p>

<p>The effect of THC on the nervous system, they argue, is
localised in the hippocampus and is accompanied by a lowered
turnover of acetylcholine. However, the more recent and
comprehensive study of Herkenham et al (1990) reported earlier in
this paper appears to contradict this hypothesis of Andreasson et
al (1987). The distribution of THC in the human CNS is much more
diffuse than these authors suggest and, to date, there is no
definite evidence that acetylcholine systems in the hippocampus
are associated with schizophrenogenesis. In fact, it is more
strongly argued that dopamine pathways in the ventral medial
brain are more directly involved in some of the 'schizophrenias'
(Helmchen and Henn, 1987). <br>
</p>

<p>Another problem with the Andreasson et al (1987) study is that
the causal relationship of cannabis to the onset of schizophrenia
still remains equivocal. Although the data appears to be
suggestive of a possible link between cannabis and the
precipitation of a schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals, the
authors go beyond their data by strongly suggesting that cannabis
is, nonetheless, another clue to the cause of schizophrenia.
However, even a cursory examination of the literature on
schizophrenia (which is beyond the scope of this paper) reveals
that the stresses of late adolescence and early adulthood appear
to be one of the major precipitating factors in the development
of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals - with or without the
use of cannabis. Since this study examined young men of this age
group, the relationship of increasing cannabis use with
increasing incidence of schizophrenia may be an artefact related
to the overall range of deviant behaviours adopted by young men
suffering from the stresses of life change for which they are
unprepared.<br>
</p>

<p>And finally, of the 55,000 conscripts entering the initial
phase of the Andreasson et al (1987) study, only 274
schizophrenics emerged of which 21 were in the high cannabis
consuming group with a total of 49 having ever consumed THC at
all. Thus, taken together with the fact that the causal
connection between cannabis use and the onset of schizophrenia
was still left unclarified, these results should be considered
insufficient for drawing any scientifically sound conclusions
concerning a meaningful link between cannabis and schizophrenia.<br>
</p>

<p>In another large-scale military study of cannabis use carried
out on American soldiers Tennant and Groesbeck (1972) found that
for the 720 hashish users culled from the 36,000 subjects of the
research sample direct medical and psychiatric observation
revealed <br>
</p>

<p>that the casual smoking of less than 10 to 12 gm of hashish
monthly resulted in no ostensible adverse effects other than
minor respiratory ailments. Panic reactions, toxic psychosis, and
schizophrenic reactions were infrequent occurrences except when
hashish was simultaneously consumed with alcohol or other
psychoactive drugs (p. 133).<br>
</p>

<p>The authors found 115 cases of acute psychosis analogous to
schizophrenia amongst hashish smokers but only 3 were of hashish
users only. The remainder were multiple drug users which included
amphetamines, hallucinogens and alcohol taken together with
hashish. In these cases treatment with chlorpromazine did not
entirely resolve the symptoms in these cases and most appeared to
move into a stage which resembled chronic schizophrenia. However,
Tennant and Groesbeck (1972) argue that because of the nature of
such a soldier sample, they had good access to premorbid records
for the entire group. &quot;In each case there was considerable
evidence that latent schizophrenia probably preexisted&quot; (p.
134). However, no indication is given in this paper as to how the
pre-trial screening was carried out nor is there any evidence of
how the criteria for determining pre-morbid latent psychosis was
established.<br>
</p>

<p>Jones (1980) argues for a partial causal relationship between
the onset of schizophrenia and cannabis use. He believes that
patients with schizophrenia, or with a genotype for schizophrenia
&quot;may be more prone to develop schizophrenic-like psychoses
after consuming only modest amounts of cannabis&quot; (p. 72).
However, his use of the term &quot;schizophrenic-like&quot; may
indicate, as in the case of toxic psychoses, that some of these
more extreme but transient negative responses to cannabis have
characteristics in common with schizophrenic disorders but are
not fully constitutive of the pathology itself. Imade and Ebie
(1991), on the other hand, in an empirical statistical study
comparing schizophrenic and cannabis psychosis symptomologies,
conclude that there is no significant difference between the two
groups leading them to speculate that cannabis may be a possible
additional risk factor in the development of schizophrenia.
Surprisingly, this conclusion of no statistically significant
difference in symptoms is contradicted by Table 2 (p. 135) in
their published results which shows a statistically significant
difference in 9 of the 13 symptom categories presented. One can
only speculate as to why the authors draw conclusions in direct
contradiction to their empirical findings.6<br>
</p>

<p>Other researchers appearing to agree with Imade's and Ebie's
conclusions concerning the similarity of cannabis psychosis and
schizophrenia are Thacore and Shukla (1976). Their study of
chronic cannabis abusers in India found a constellation of
symptoms some of which are similar to schizophrenia while other
are not. Their work indicates that the special characteristics of
schizophrenic thought disorder (loosening of association, thought
blockage, disturbance in conceptual thinking, alienation of
thought) occur statistically significantly more frequently in
schizophrenic patients than in cannabis intoxicants suffering
psychotic-like reactions. Hallucinations were experienced equally
in both conditions but &quot;all (cannabis) patients had
predominant persecutory delusions in a setting of clear
sensorium&quot; (p. 384) in contrast to schizophrenics who do not
show any capacity for rational self-reflection while in an acute
phase. Although these findings suggest some fundamental
differences between the two conditions, caution must be applied
in accepting these results because of the small sample involved
and the culturally idiosyncratic method of scoring and
interpreting patients' symptoms.<br>
</p>

<p>In conjunction with Jones (1980) Hollister (1988) asserts,
based on research conducted by Knudsen and Vilmar (1984) as well
as by Tunving (1985), that cannabis use may aggravate an already
existing schizophrenia, and this would be true whether the
pathology was as yet unmanifest, but he is not convinced that THC
can cause schizophrenia or depressive disorders on its own.
Moreover, referring to Rottanburg et al (1982), he declares that
cannabis use may lead to &quot;a self-limiting
hypomanic-schizophrenic-like psychosis&quot; (Hollister, 1988, p.
112). Again, this statement suggests that the relationship
between drug use and pathology may be linked through an as yet
unidentified third factor involving the preference by
schizophrenics for particular classes of drugs in their attempts
at self-medication and thus control of frightening delusional
states. Consequently, there appears to be an association between
cannabis use by diagnosed schizophrenics which confounds the
interpretations of a causal link between cannabis and
schizophrenia. Needless to say, the connection is problematic and
unresolved and certainly needs considerably more and better
controlled research before any firm conclusions can be drawn.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Weller (1985) summarises a number of findings across a variety
of studies aimed at establishing a profile of cannabis users. <br>
</p>

<p>One study found that marijuana users were more impulsive and
nonconforming than nonusers. Another study discovered more
&quot;psychiatric impairment&quot; in users based on personality
tests. A self-administered drug survey conducted at two colleges
found that users were less likely to be at the top of their
class, had looser religious ties, and were more dissatisfied with
school. They were also more likely to be bored, anxious, cynical,
disgusted, moody, impulsive, rebellious, or restless. In still
another study, marijuana users were more opposed than nonusers to
external control and likely to use the drug to relieve tension
(p.101).7<br>
</p>

<p>He criticises much of this characterisation by arguing that
little effort was made to determine the personality types and
differences before subjects became involved in a cannabis
'lifestyle'. Thus, it is arguable that any ascription of
personality type for cannabis users must be seen as not
scientifically grounded and hence somewhat spurious. This logical
error of explanations given post hoc propter hoc appears to be a
commonly repeated one throughout the cannabis literature.
However, Weil's (1975) argument that cannabis is an &quot;active
placebo&quot; (p. 95) which facilitates already existent covert
behaviours and pathologies offers an equally credible explanation
for most observations made concerning pathological syndromes and
cannabis use with the added benefit of accounting, in part, for
the great variation seen from individual to individual. One such
constellation of behaviours which has been repeatedly claimed as
unique to chronic cannabis users is the so-called
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; to which we now turn.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>McGlothlin and West (1968) first reported that regular
cannabis use can lead to the development of passive,
inward-turning, amotivational personality characteristics. At
about the same time, Smith (1968) made a similar observation,
based on several young marijuana users, that regular cannabis
ingestion leads to a loss of desire to compete and work which,
like McGlothlin and West, he labelled the &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot;. Weller (1985) describes the characteristics
associated with this hypothesised syndrome.<br>
</p>

<p>This contention was based on clinical observation of
middle-class, heavy marijuana users referred to them for
treatment. Conforming, achievement-oriented behaviour had changed
to relaxed and careless drifting. Inability to concentrate for
long periods, endure frustration, follow routines, and carry out
complex, long-term plans, as well as apathy and loss of
effectiveness, were noted. Such individuals became totally
involved with the present at the expense of future goals. They
had less objective productivity and seemed to withdraw subtly
from the challenge of life (pp. 95, 98).<br>
</p>

<p>He reminds us, however, that no specific studies or case
reports were cited to support McGlothlin's and West's (1968)
observations. Other descriptors which supposedly characterise
this syndrome include: shift or decline in ambition;
unproductive, aimless life; poor class attendance; lack of goals;
poor school performance; apathy; disorientation; and depression
(Weller, 1985). Nevertheless, in most cases symptoms disappeared
if marijuana was discontinued suggesting not so much as a
syndrome but behaviour of chronically intoxicated individuals
using their intoxicated state as a way of focusing their
resentment of social and parental pressure. <br>
</p>

<p>In addition, Weller (1985) cites a number of studies which
report lowered levels of sperm and testosterone. The latter
change was observed in a closed ward situation with subjects at
first showing no alteration in testosterone levels for about four
weeks, followed by a subsequent and gradual drop in testosterone
level which continued until cannabis intake stopped. This
situation reversed itself on cessation of cannabis intake with
levels beginning to rise after one week's abstinence. Weller
concludes that &quot;if testosterone affects aggression and
drive, low testosterone might affect motivation. However, this
relationship must be considered hypothetical without additional
research (p. 102).&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) reminds us that the syndrome is so variable in
presentation and influenced by the magnitude and type of
premorbid pathology, the very existence of such a syndrome
remains quite controversial. On the other hand, lethargy and loss
of ambition and goal orientation persist during intervals of
withdrawal from cannabis. In many cases this anergic condition is
apparently reversed after months of abstinence, but Cohen
indicates that some clinicians report what they believe to be the
occurrence of permanent brain dysfunction in some subjects.
Again, as in reports of other psychopathologies being connected
to cannabis usage, the constellation of symptoms tends not to
constitute a definite syndrome with great variation being
observed in each case. <br>
</p>

<p>The symptoms of what is being called &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; could be understood as a facilitated endogenous
depressive disorder which is brought to the fore by chronic
cannabis use in a minority of individuals. Halikas et al (1978)
reported a high incidence of depressive disorder in regular
cannabis users who had smoked at least fifty times in the past
six months before the commencement of the study. Weller (1985)
indicates that an examination of the subjects of that study
reveals that most were young (mean age = 22 years), middle-class
and had been smoking cannabis for an average of 2 years.
&quot;Systematic evaluation revealed that most of their
psychiatric problems predated marijuana use. About 18% had a
history of definite or probable depression before significant
marijuana use (p. 102).&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind, once again, that the subjects of
many of these studies are referred for treatment and hence do not
represent the population of cannabis users. In fact, from the
numbers given in many sources, those presenting with
psychopathologies of any kind represent a very small minority
indeed. For example, the 1991 NCADA survey of drug use in
Australia reveals that 30+% of all Australians have tried
cannabis at least once. 13.1% have used it within the past year
and 5.4% within the last week. Thus, there are hundreds of
thousands of cannabis users who apparently function well enough
so that they do not come to the attention of medical or legal
authorities. If &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; was a fact of
cannabis use, Australian society would unmistakably feel its
impact. One can only conclude that this supposed 'syndrome' is,
in actuality, the mis-labelling of a latent affect disorder
which, in a small minority of unfortunate individuals, becomes
manifest when facilitated by chronic cannabis use. <br>
<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="4"><b>TASK PERFORMANCE<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>It is not surprising to find repeated assertions in the
literature of reduced performance on learning and memory tasks in
a population of cannabis users who are available for evaluation
largely through psychiatric referral. The pathological symptoms
leading to referral most often include agitation (panic
disorders) and/or lethargy (amotivation). These symptoms are
often primary manifestations of on-going affect disorders and, in
the case of depression, are frequently accompanied by feelings of
alienation, depersonalisation, flattened affect, memory and other
cognitive impairments. A large-scale study by Mullins et al
(1974) conducted for the United States Air Force on recent
conscripts who were, for the most part, young, healthy and not
psychiatrically morbid, reveals a different picture regarding
performance among cannabis users.<br>
</p>

<p>The authors compared 2,842 US Air Force trainees who had used
only cannabis with 1,843 who had used cannabis and/or other drugs
and with a control sample of 9,368 on whom no drug-using
information was available. Comparisons were made on five separate
aptitude measures, on educational level attained prior to
enlistment, and on three measures of performance of Air Force
duties. These aptitude measures are the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) and four aptitude indexes of the Airman
Qualifying Examination (AQE); Mechanical (M), Administrative (A),
General (G), and Electronic (E). Comparisons of scores were made
between those who used only cannabis; those who used cannabis in
conjunction with some other drug; those who used other drugs
singly, but not cannabis; those who used other drugs in
combination, but not cannabis; and the control group. It was
found that every mean score for the drug using groups was
significantly different from the control group at p = 0.01 or
better. The most interesting finding, however, is that for level
of performance &quot;all means are significantly lower than the
control mean except the means for the cannabis-only group, which
are significantly higher than the control means&quot; (Mullins et
al, 1974, p. 4)<br>
</p>

<p>Mullins et al (1974) argue that the differences between the
cannabis-only group and the other drug groups in relation to the
controls may be the result of the degree of drug use. In other
words, multiple drug users are seen by the authors as likely
heavy users as opposed to cannabis-only user group. Thus, the
lower means for the multiple drug groups are interpreted as
resulting from the total overall consumption of drugs rather than
the mixing of mind-altering substances. In addition, when
controlling for total ingestion of cannabis, the authors conclude
that the cannabis-only group is more talented on average
(according to the operational definition of talent embedded in
the Air Force aptitude tests) than any of the other groups
tested. Although the authors argue that the lower scores of the
multiple group are likely due to the degree of overall
consumption of drugs, they conclude that one of the more notable
dangers of cannabis is in coupling it with other drugs.8<br>
</p>

<p>The authors attempt to explain the results by first observing
that the use of other drugs, with or without cannabis, is
correlated with lower overall educational attainment in the
study's subject group. They continue by noting that there are
significantly more cannabis-only users who have graduated from
high school (76.4%) than there are in the control group (70.7%),
which is offered in partial explanation of the higher aptitude
scores achieved by the cannabis-only group. In light of our
earlier discussion concerning motivation, both achievement scores
and educational level tend to be good indicators of higher
motivation in the cannabis-only users than in the other
experimental groups and the controls. On the other hand, of those
controls and cannabis-only users who entered university, Mullins
et al found a significantly higher percentage of control subjects
(37.5%) than of cannabis-only subjects (24.9%) completed their
studies.<br>
</p>

<p>Strangely, in summarising their study the authors conclude
that this last difference indicates the possible existence of an
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; in cannabis-only users and, in
their final remarks, strongly suggest that cannabis has definite
serious, negative effects on behaviour. However, in summarising
their findings they state<br>
</p>

<p>...in general, the use of cannabis-only appears to be
associated with a much less serious performance deficiency than
the use of other drugs, singly or in combination&quot; (Mullins
et al, 1974, p. 11)<br>
</p>

<p>This statement can only be seen as a distortion of the
empirical findings of these researchers. Except for the issue of
university completion rates for the various groups, cannabis-only
users in their study appear to be superior in performance on
every measure used by the United States Air Force. The authors'
conclusion, on the other hand, stresses that the performance of
the cannabis-only group is merely less worse than the multiple
drug groups rather than better than all other groups. Again, this
is an good example of the problems which occur with value-driven
research in the investigation of cannabis. No doubt this method
of interpretation of the empirical findings arises because it is
very unlikely that positive conclusions concerning cannabis use
in young airmen would lead to career advancement for members of
the military who conduct social science research on their own
organisation.<br>
</p>

<p>Of course, there have been a number of other studies which
have obtained very different results when measuring performance.
It should be noted, however, that most of these have been
conducted on a more select population than the Mullins et al
investigation, with considerably smaller sample sizes and often
on individuals who have been psychiatrically referred. Cohen's
(1986) general review of these issues in relation to cannabis
leads him to conclude that<br>
</p>

<p>A wide range of intellectual performance impairment due to
marijuana intoxication is known. Cognitive tasks, such as digit
symbol substitution, complex reaction time, recent memory and
serial subtractions, are all performed with an increased error
rate as compared to the sober state. These abilities are all
generally recognised to be necessary to perform skilled tasks.
Marijuana interferes with the transfer of information from
immediate to short-term storage. Less demanding tasks such as
simple reaction time are performed as well during the non-drug
condition. A major unresolved question is whether long-term use
produces irreversible effects (p. 157).<br>
</p>

<p>Two confounding issues are generally not critically addressed
in the literature on cannabis and performance summarised by Cohen
(1986) above. The first is proper control for the role of
motivational levels in the outcome of performance tests conducted
on cannabis intoxicated individuals. THC may have differential
effects on motivation depending on the type of task to be
completed. Cohen acknowledges that the apparent attenuation of
the ability to learn while intoxicated with cannabis may be due
to possible perceptual and motivational changes experienced by
intoxicants. He speculates that the concomitant impairment of
immediate recall associated with these changes is linked to a
lack of motivation to learn and to the related attenuation of
logical thinking abilities which makes the acquisition of new
information more difficult. <br>
</p>

<p>Simply stated from a more phenomenological perspective, while
intoxicated, &quot;right brain&quot; activities appear to be
preferred by those using cannabis. Logico-deductive cognitions
tend to be usurped by metaphoric imaging arising as a result of
an intensified 'absorptive state'. &quot;Absorption&quot;, a
personality characteristic often studied in relation to hypnosis
and other altered state of consciousness experiences, appears to
deploy attention in ways antithetical to the more usual
linguistically ordered information processing of daily life
activities (Tellegen and Atkinson, 1974; Tellegen, 1982). Since
the majority of memory and performance tasks used in many of the
studies on cannabis and performance are dependent on language
processing (&quot;left brain&quot;) for recall, it is not
surprising that most cannabis users do less well on these tests
when intoxicated.<br>
</p>

<p>The second issue is, naturally, the notion of 'long' and
'short' term memory employed by Cohen (1986) and others. If we
recognise that different styles of cognition and learning are
associated with different states of consciousness (Tart, 1972),
then the model of memory storage and transfer deployed by Cohen
is likely to be inapplicable to the study of individuals in an
&quot;Absorptive&quot; state of consciousness. In addition, the
statement about information &quot;transfer&quot; as used by Cohen
is, at this stage of learning and memory research, more metaphor
than fact since the actual neuropsychological substrates and
mechanisms of this hypothetical construct have yet to be located
and their mechanisms delineated. <br>
</p>

<p>Creason et al (1981), on the other hand, do attempt to control
for motivation in relation to cannabis consumption levels in
their study of 55 high school adolescents. From this group four
sub-groups were identified consisting of nonusers
(&quot;Never&quot;), casual users (&quot;less than once a
week&quot; or &quot;once or twice a week&quot;), heavy users
(&quot;three or more times a week&quot; or &quot;daily&quot;),
and heavy users who are now ex-users (p. 449). Motivation was
operationally defined as<br>
</p>

<p>...the difference between the subject's performance on a task
when working for a reward and when the subject is not externally
motivated. A subject who performed better working for a reward
than when not was considered more motivated than a subject who
performed at the same level regardless of whether there was a
reward at stake (p. 448).<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;The dependent variable was the difference in the number
of solved single-solution anagrams between the first and second
trials,&quot; the assumption being the first trial measured
actual ability and the second measured performance level when
motivated, with the difference showing the effect of motivation
(p. 449). From this research design the authors found that heavy
users and heavy ex-users were significantly (statistically) lower
in motivation than non-users or casual users, the latter two
groups showing no significant difference. The authors thus
conclude that the effect of heavy use on motivation is not
dependent on the presence of the drug in the user's system. To
account for this they hypothesise the existence of an intervening
variable, such as a personality factor, which distinguishes those
who are high users from low or non-users. In conclusion they
argue that there is good evidence in the research literature to
suggest that &quot;heavy marijuana use is limited to those who
are already inclined to low motivation and depression&quot; ( p.
452) Unfortunately, Creason et al were not able to assess for any
possible pre-existing psychiatric morbidity or personality
differences which may have indicated any prior conditions in
heavy users before the commencement of their cannabis habit.
Thus, there is no empirical evidence arising from this study
which is able to support their explanatory hypothesis.<br>
</p>

<p>Although there have been suggestions regarding brain damage in
cannabis users, as cited earlier in this paper, Varma et al
(1988) find no evidence of a real difference between users and
controls on measures of intelligence and memory. These findings
are consistent with two United States Government studies
(National Institute of Mental Health, 1972, cited in Rubin and
Comitas, 1975; National Institute on Drug Abuse,1980) in which
the authors suggest that any differences found between cannabis
users and non-users in cognitive functioning pertain more to
perceptuo-motor tasks. However, Varma et al (1988) observed that
in Indian cannabis users who are not part of a deviant
sub-culture, the users still appear to be significantly more
disabled in &quot;personal, social and vocational
functioning&quot; (p. 151). However, the higher rating of
disability in this group of cannabis users did not, in the
opinion of the authors, amount to a noticeable difference. <br>
</p>

<p>In assessing the work of Varma et al (1988) it is necessary to
understand that the group studied is the equivalent, in the West,
of heavy, chronic drinkers of alcohol. This is underscored by the
authors' recruitment of subjects amongst a known group of heavy
users whose life-style revolves around congregating together
specifically for the purpose of consuming cannabis. In addition,
findings of higher 'neuroticism' and 'psychoticism' test scores
for these individuals also indicates that they are not average
members of the society being studied (Eysenck, 1960).<br>
</p>

<p>In effect, this research is confused by the usual problems of
personality disorder and psychopathology almost certainly
existing in the study group prior to cannabis addiction as
indicated by membership in and adherence to a cannabis-based
sub-group in the context of a country (India) in which this
substance is widely accepted and probably broadly used in other
social circles as well. If pathology was not present prior, then
such extreme use could be regarded as a cause of the
psychological problems (as in the case of severe alcohol abuse).
Nevertheless, this cannabis sub-culture is an inappropriate group
to estimate the long-term effects of social cannabis ingestion,
just as it would be inappropriate to estimate the social,
physiological and psychological effects of alcohol by studying
chronic, intractable drunks.<br>
</p>

<p>In contrast to Varma et al (1988), a study by Schwartz et al
(1989) claims to demonstrate definite adverse effects of cannabis
on memory. The latter researchers evaluated the auditory/verbal
and visual/spatial memory for groups matched on age, IQ, and
absence of previous learning disabilities. The study used 10
cannabis-dependent adolescents and compared them with the
performance two control groups consisting of 8 adolescent drug
abusers, who had not been long-term users of cannabis, and 9
adolescents who had never used any drug. Significant differences
between the cannabis-dependent group and the two control groups
were demonstrated on the Benton Visual Retention Test and the
Wechsler Memory Scale Prose Passages. The authors also found
that, after 6 weeks of supervised abstention from intoxicants,
those in the cannabis-dependent group demonstrated some
improvement on the Wechsler Memory Prose Passages score and on
the Benton Visual Retention Test. This improvement, however,
failed to achieve statistical significance leading the authors to
conclude that cannabis-dependent adolescents develop selective
short-term memory deficits which appear to continue for at least
6 weeks after the complete cessation of cannabis intake.<br>
</p>

<p>This last study employs very small numbers of subjects in its
experimental and control groups, which makes the results somewhat
weak in a statistical sense. Further, in this research the
experimental subjects consumed approximately 900mg/week of THC
(18 grams of high-potency marijuana @ 5% THC) which is about
equivalent to 130 mg/day for a 4 month period - considerably
higher than most heavy users. This level of cannabis was consumed
to within a couple of days of end of the trial.<br>
</p>

<p>Heavy users, according to a recent survey conducted by the
Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland, Australia use about 10
grams of cannabis containing about 2-3% THC, or 300mg of
THC/week.9 The ward study by Schwartz et al (1989) referred to
here provided subjects with about 900mg THC/week, or three times
the amount of in vivo heavy users. If the physiological half-life
is taken as one week (Cf. Nahas, 1984), then at the end of a 6
week abstinence period following 12 weeks of cannabis ingestion
at the rate of 900mg THC/week, the lipid burden of THC will be
approximately 28mg THC.10 Further, if, as revealed in the work of
Chesher et al (1985), 1-2 mg of ingested cannabis causes a
similar level of behavioural deficit as a 0.05 blood alcohol
level, then the retest situation in the Schwartz et al study is
on subjects who are still in a highly THC affected state. <br>
</p>

<p>Unlike alcohol, THC is highly soluble in body lipids and it is
this property which causes it to remain systemically present much
longer than water soluble alcohol. Thus, the resultant levels of
THC accumulated by participants in the Schwartz et al (1989)
study would be extremely high at the end of the first part of the
study. With a half-life of 5-7 days it would be many weeks before
the serum THC would be at an equivalent zero level for these
extremely high-dose subjects. It is quite conceivable, therefore,
that the subjects were, at re-test time, still at or above the
intoxication equivalent of 0.05 blood alcohol.11 This, of course,
does not include an approximation for the effect of any
additional THC remaining in brain lipids which, conceivably,
could still be quite high. Therefore, low or zero measures of
serum THC do not guarantee that participants in the post-test
section of the Schwartz et al study are cannabis-free and, hence,
the test subjects may still be affected by a low-level,
background intoxication. <br>
</p>

<p>Returning to the issue of perceptuo-motor and cognitive
performance, Chesher et al (1985), using nine different tests,
attempted to ascertain the effects of cannabis consumption on
performance in a controlled study employing individuals in a dose
level by time pre- post-drug experimental design. Employing the
centroids of the combined test scores for each condition, the
authors compared the performance effects of smoked cannabis,
orally ingested cannabis, and alcohol with the resulting evidence
suggesting that &quot;the duration of impairment produced by all
three drugs at the doses used was very similar&quot; (p. 624).
However, the earlier findings of Weil et al (1968), that some
dose-related impairment is observable on simple intellectual and
psychomotor tests for naive subjects but not for regular users,
indicates a need for finer elucidation of the observed effects,
if the results of Chesher et al are to be taken at face value.<br>
</p>

<p>Chesher et al's (1985) results also suggest that orally
administered THC is 4000 times more potent than ethanol in its
pharmacological action. Although exact comparisons could not be
made between smoked cannabis and imbibed alcohol, it was
estimated that 1-2 mg of THC in the marijuana-to-be-smoked
produces a decrement in performance equivalent to 0.05 blood
alcohol level (p. 627). This finding suggests that, since the
average marijuana cigarette contains approximately 1-3 mg of THC,
similar restrictions would have to be placed on cannabis
consumption and driving as now exist for alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p>Hollister (1988) reports a summary of four separate studies in
which the occurrence of positive serum tests for drugs in dead
drivers involving 2610 fatalities was estimated. Alcohol was
found in 1680 cases and THC in 351 with 294 of the latter
involving alcohol as well. Of those found with THC, 278 had serum
concentrations less than 5mg/ml, suggesting that &quot;THC plays
a relatively minor role in fatal traffic accidents as compared
with alcohol&quot; (Hollister, 1988, p. 113; McBay, 1986). In
other words, only 2.2% of cannabis-only users were involved in
these fatal accidents. Of course, the long half-life of
cannabinols in the body and the presence of them in blood long
after acute intoxication has ceased, as seen from the studies
cited above, does not indicate whether or not those individuals
who tested positive in the quoted road fatalities were
intoxicated.<br>
</p>

<p>Cohen (1986) asserts, in his summary of the drug and driving
research literature, that 70% of all fatal auto crashes involve
alcohol. However, he reports that 37% of the fatal crashes
studied tested positive for the presence of serum cannabinols,
but these were found mainly in combination with alcohol and other
psycho-active drugs with cannabis-only users representing 12% of
all those cases involving cannabis. Alcohol was mixed with
cannabis in 81% of the cannabis cases and, again, it is
impossible to tell, unlike with alcohol, whether those testing
positive for cannabinols were in the acute phase of intoxication
rather than several days away from last cannabis usage. From his
summary of the statistics Cohen therefore argues that<br>
</p>

<p>Although alcohol is the prime cause of automotive accidents,
marijuana and cocaine are currently being found frequently enough
to constitute potentially significant problems. It is established
that marijuana and alcohol have additive effects upon driving
skills. Since marijuana metabolites were found in more than a
third of the drivers, impairment due to marijuana is contributing
to the problem (p. 158).<br>
</p>

<p>The above research likewise is confounded by the presence of
alcohol in the majority of cannabis cases. In order to support
Cohen's contention, data would be required to show that accidents
are increasing, in any given demographic area, in direct
proportion to the increase in use of drugs such as marijuana and
cocaine while simultaneously controlling for alcohol use. Without
such clear-cut quantitative relationships one must still conclude
that alcohol is the primary cause of fatal crashes even where
other drugs are present. Again, the findings of THC metabolites
in 37% of the drivers involved in fatal crashes do not indicate
that these individuals were intoxicated with THC at the time.
However, the data may be suggesting that there is an increased
danger when driving on alcohol for cannabis users even post acute
intoxication. Whether the hypothesised additive effect of THC and
alcohol is a fact and/or whether this effect happens post acute
cannabis intoxication remains to be elucidated through carefully
controlled research which has not yet been done.<br>
</p>

<p>Weil (1975), although writing in the early 1970s, still
provides a useful and insightful summary of research on cannabis
and performance. <br>
</p>

<p>Because marihuana is such an unimpressive pharmacological
agent, it is not a very interesting drug to study in a
laboratory. Pharmacologists cannot get a handle on it with their
methods, and because they cannot see the reality of the
nonmaterial state of consciousness that users experience, they
are forced to design experimental situations very far removed
from the real world in order to get measurable effects. There are
three conditions under which marihuana can be shown to impair
general psychological performance in laboratory subjects. They
are: (1) by giving it to people who have never had it before; (2)
by giving people very high doses that they are not used to (or
giving it orally to people used to smoking it); and (3) by giving
people very hard things to do, especially things that they have
never had a chance to practise while under the influence of the
drug. Under any of these three conditions, pharmacologists can
demonstrate that marihuana impairs performance (p. 86).<br>
</p>

<p>Most altered states of consciousness, such as those produced
in hypnosis, meditation and ecstatic experiences, involve
deployment of attention strongly in the present. This
'unreflected', unself-conscious attentional state, which is
focused primarily in the 'now', will, whether induced by drugs or
not, possibly interfere with the normal memory processes
associated with the 'reflected' conscious state required for
discursive thought and logico-temporal activities usually
associated with memory and learning. Thus, any discussion of
memory and THC use must consider the possibility that THC
facilitates a free-floating 'absorptive' state which favours
engagement in spatial-metaphoric cognitive styles of the
'unreflected' state (Fabian and Fishkin, 1981). It is thus
possible that the apparent memory deficits seen in individuals
intoxicated with THC, who are being required to perform and
attend to verbal, temporal, logico-deductive activities, is the
result of 'time-sharing' between the two states. The effect is to
interrupt the usual cognitive and memory consolidation processes.
<br>
</p>

<p>This 'time-sharing' process can be conceptualised as a
temporary and rapid movement out of the induced 'unreflected'
state of consciousness into 'reflected' consciousness when enough
'demand' is made to attend to a temporal, discursive information
stream. As soon as demand falls below some critical threshold
required for attention, the 'unreflected' state resumes thus
disrupting any on-going learning process. The laying down of
short-term memory and the ability to attend accurately to
objective (clock) time may require a certain level of continuous
background 'self-observation' - a primarily 'reflected' state
activity. Therefore, assigning the cause of memory deficits
measured in THC intoxicated individuals to the pharmacological
action of cannabis may be an attribution error with cannabis
being primarily a catalyst for these altered states which are the
actual cause for a failure to process discursive information in
the usual way.<br>
<br>

<p><font size="4"><b>CONCLUSIONS<br>
</b></font></p>

<p>Although this review has ranged over a rather broad area
encompassing a number of different research disciplines, there
appears to be a common concern linking most of the research
reviewed - is cannabis a significant public health risk? It is
the opinion of this author that this question is still, after
almost thirty years of research effort, unclarified. </p>

<p>In the physiological domain there certainly appears to be
reasonably strong evidence of the potential threat to the human
respiratory system associated with chronic, heavy cannabis
smoking. However, whether use amongst moderate, social cannabis
smokers poses the same risk is a question as yet unanswered. This
risk is, of course, from the combustion by-products of the
cannabis leaves, stems, and flowers and is not directly
associated with the active ingredient for which cannabis is
sought and used, -9-tetrahydrocannabinol. One method for
obviating such a health risk would be to make pharmacologically
pure forms of orally ingestible THC available to those who want
it in a similar manner to the way in which governments now
regulate the production and distribution of alcohol. </p>

<p>In general, the results of much of the research concerning the
effects of THC on the CNS appears to be either negative or
inconclusive. The work of Heath and colleagues is an exception,
of course, but as was shown above, this research is highly
confounded and cannot be considered to be reliable in spite of
the fact that it is widely quoted in scientific and other
literature on cannabis. </p>

<p>Turning to the psychological dimension, the
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; appears to be a not very
useful hypothetical construct which is poorly grounded in
empirical psychological data. The populations studied in this
type of research are often psychiatric referrals and it has been
revealed in other, more methodologically thorough research, that
supposed sufferers of cannabis-induced &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; often had signs of clinical depression prior to
their use of cannabis. As argued earlier in this paper,
&quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; appears to be a category
seeking content, especially when the profile of individuals
studied is better understood through the more conventional
psychiatric diagnostic category of depressive disorder.
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that cannabis has some effect
on behaviour and performance. Driving a motor vehicle while
intoxicated with cannabis will certainly increase the risk of an
accident. However, the apparent 'permanent' changes to memory and
performance as demonstrated in some 'ward' studies are not
entirely convincing considering the exaggerated dose levels used
and the long half-life of THC in humans. </p>

<p>Studies in performance and aptitude such as that by Mullins et
al (1974) highlight the value-driven quality of much of the
research reviewed here. When the effects of alcohol and other
drugs are controlled, cannabis-only users apparently show
significantly greater overall aptitude than any other group
amongst U.S. Air Force recruits. Nevertheless, this did not stop
the authors from sounding alarms concerning the potential harmful
effects of cannabis on performance in young men. In fact, it
appears as if most of the research reviewed by this author
commenced from an a priori position that cannabis is dangerous to
human health, physiological and psychological, it only remains to
discover just how dangerous. In pursuing these objectives authors
such as Brill and Nahas (1984) breached all current good
scientific practice by using the writings of a Nineteenth Century
physician to make a supposed empirical case in the late Twentieth
Century without any apparent recognition on their part of the
potential for misinterpretation or misapplication. <br>
</p>

<p>It appears as though two possible hypotheses are available
regarding cannabis and public health. The first is that cannabis
is a potential public health problem, it merely remains to be
discovered to what degree. The second states that cannabis
represents no significant or unreasonable threat to the general
public well-being. According to the physicist, James Jeans
(1958), expanding on William of Occam's 'Razor'<br>
</p>

<p>When two hypotheses are possible, we provisionally choose that
which our minds adjudge to be the simpler, on the supposition
that this is the more likely to lead in the direction of the
truth. It includes as a special case the principle of Occam's
razor - 'entia non multiplicanda praeter necessitatem' (p.183). <br>
</p>

<p>From the position of this widely held scientific principle it
is arguable that only the second hypothesis is reasonable
regarding the current debate on cannabis. From the use levels
observed in Australia (31.9% have ever tried cannabis and 7.1%
(1.3 million Australians) use it once a month or more [Department
of Health, Housing and Community Services, 1991]), when taken in
conjunction with the very small number of cases who actually come
to the attention of medical authorities as a direct result of
cannabis use, one can only conclude that the simpler hypothesis
which covers the facts is that cannabis use does not pose a
significantly increased risk to public health over and above many
other activities which are considered necessary and/or socially
acceptable.<br>
</p>

<p>As suggested by Weil (1975) altered state experiences appear
to be a natural human capacity which can be facilitated by the
ingestion of psychoactive substances such as THC. The negative
reporting, vis-&#136;-vis cannabis and performance, may be
understood as a value judgement regarding what type of mental
state and hence style of performance is deemed useful by society.
In other contexts, the present-centred altered state of
consciousness, which can be induced by cannabis, is highly prized
in the contemplative religious traditions of Christianity,
Buddhism and Islam. The ability of this altered state to open
broader perspectives and, hence, new life meanings appears to be
part of a growth process which has the power to bring about
personal renewal and relieve psychological suffering. Although
these religious traditions have developed methods for achieving
these altered states without the use of pharmacological
facilitators, the need for such experiences is probably innate to
human personality. In the age of high-tech medicine the use of
chemical substances to achieve these ends should not be
surprising.<br>
</p>

<p>The psychiatrist Arthur Deikman (1982) suggests that the
bifurcation of consciousness into &quot;observing&quot;
(objective) and &quot;experiencing&quot; (receptive) selves is
the basis of mystical experience with the latter, 'unreflected'
state, too often missing in our lives. He further reminds us that
without the cultivation of the &quot;experiencing self&quot; we
may fail to enter into mystical awareness and therefore be unable
to heal the psychopathology innate to our human condition. He
thus argues for a return to mysticism as both outlook and
technique in the process of human growth.<br>
</p>

<p>The mystical tradition has been concerned with the very
problems that modern psychotherapy has been unable to resolve. It
makes sense, therefore, to investigate mysticism with a view to
dealing more effectively with those problems and gaining wisdom
as human beings (p. 4).<br>
</p>

<p>Finally, it has been suggested by numerous renown philosophers
and psychologists that without the ability to enter wholly into
these &quot;experiencing&quot; altered states, we may fail to
fully actualise our human creative and cultural potentials
(James, 1936; Jung, 1960; Maslow, 1968; Wilber, 1977). Thus, we
may understand the use of cannabis in society not only as a
public health issue, but as a sign of a fundamental but
unfulfilled human need, which cannabis users attempt to fill by
use of the drug, albeit inadequately. <br>

<p>1Searches were conducted in two data bases: Medline (Index
Medicus) and PsychInfo (Psychological Abstracts). The following
inclusive 'or' statement was searched: MARIJUANA OR THC OR
CANNABIS OR TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL. Medline produced 2253 'hits'
and PsychInfo 1935. One can assume that there is some overlap,
hence the approximation of over 4000. <br>
</p>

<p>2The earlier, 1973, study of Heath, in addition to the septal
area, included recording sites in the cerebellum, postero ventral
lateral thalamus, hippocampus, and orbital and temporal cortices.
The thalamic and hippocampal sites are major components of the
limbic system and hence intrinsically involved with emotional
expression and would most likely show unusual and significantly
different activity in a situation of induced stress.<br>
</p>

<p>3The experimental group received exposure to marijuana smoke
containing 2.29% D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the controls were
exposed to either marijuana smoke containing 0.1%
D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or tobacco smoke.<br>

<p>5This idea, of course, is also the claim of many famous,
historical mystics and religious leaders.<br>

</p>

<p>6A possible reason for this apparent contradiction may lie in
the sources of funding for cannabis research. Most money comes
from government coffers and most governments are in opposition to
cannabis use. Therefore, one may conclude that researchers will
attempt to minimize findings which do not satisfy the views of
their funders in order to insure future support. This may seem
harsh, if one accepts the myth of scientific objectivity, but
scientists are as competitive as any other group in their
attempts to stay in the &quot;game&quot; and to win.<br>
</p>

<p>7For his summary he draws extensively on Halikas, Shapiro, and
Weller (1978).<br>
</p>

<p>8However, the authors qualify this statement later on by
indicating that it is the heavy use of cannabis in conjunction
with other drugs which is most likely the cause of the reduced
scores. They fail to make the observation that heavy drug users
of any kind, particularly heavy multiple drug users, are very
likely to be suffering from some other psychiatric disorder which
may affect motivation and/or performance.<br>

<p>10This was calculated using a discrete approximation of a
half-life decay.<br>
</p>

<p>11It should be remembered that 1-2 mg of THC to be consumed is
the equivelant of an alcohol blood level of 0.05 (Chesher et al,
1985). <br>

</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">This paper argues that the so-called
cannabis 'amotivation syndrome', widely reported in the
literature, may not be a single nosological entity, but
represent, instead, a change in cognitive style emerging as a
result of cannabis's ability to facilitate a unique attentional
state favoured by those who have a higher than average level of a
personality factor referred to as 'trait absorption'.
Exaggeration of the absorptive style of cognition through
cannabis use, when taken in the context of either a pre-existing
or a reactive depression, may be what has been mistakenly
categorized as 'amotivational syndrome'.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">In spite of the pressure of increasing
law enforcement campaigns and more sophisticated educational
endeavours in Australia and other Western democracies, cannabis
is not apparently losing its attractiveness to many young people
[1]. One of the major concerns expressed by those who are
attempting to reduce cannabis use in the young is the occurrence
amongst users of a collocation of behaviours and attitudes
collectively referred to as the 'amotivational syndrome' [2, 3].
This presumed psychological syndrome is believed to be a direct
result of regular, heavy cannabis use and leaves those so
affected reduced in motivation and capacity for the usual
activities required for achievement and success in today's world.
Although many anti-cannabis campaigners accept, <i>a priori,</i>
the existence of the 'amotivational syndrome', there is still
some considerable debate as to whether it is an actual
nosological entity and whether all cannabis users are so
effected.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">This article will argue that
'amotivational syndrome' is not, in fact, a single entity, but,
rather, a collection of behaviours which emerge as the result of
the combination of the effects of an already existent or a
reactive depression occurring concomitantly with cannabis's
ability to facilitate a unique attentional state favoured by
those who have a higher than average level of a personality
factor referred to as 'trait absorption' [4]. Thus, the apparent
loss of motivation for many socially accepted behaviours and
tasks as well as the changes in attitude and cognitive style
associated with cannabis use may represent a re-orientation in
attentional style, meaning and values rather than merely a
collapse into pharmacologically induced pathology. So, it may be
that cannabis is not being predicably affected by educational or
law enforcement programs because the urge to use the drug arises
for many from a primary psychological need which far outweighs
the power of those sorts of external pressures. The primary
personality 'need' being described here is the propensity of
certain individuals to seek and choose to experience 'flow' [5]
or 'absorptive' states for their own sake because of their
intrinsic self-rewarding qualities.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">In order to explore the possible
relationship between 'trait absorption' and apparent
'amotivational syndrome' this paper will first present a review
of the 'amotivational syndrome' literature followed by a
delineation of the personality factor, 'trait absorption'. In the
final section a re-examination of 'amotivational syndrome' will
be undertaken in the light of the discussion of the absorptive
personality type and the unique styles of attention deployment
preferred by these individuals. Further, it will be suggested
that not only are attempts by cannabis users to augment the
'absorptive' cognitive style not pathological, but this type of
behaviour may be seen as a healthy sign of a striving to
re-balance cognitive 'style' from over-dependence on the active,
achieving, doer mode of the post-industrial age to the
'receptive' style of the visionary and mystic more reminiscent of
traditional spirituality and artistically creative life-styles
[43].<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Cannabis research has, for the past
three decades, failed to reach any unassailable conclusions
regarding long-term psychological effects of the drug on
otherwise normal, healthy users [6, 7, 8, 9, 45, 46]. Research
has been, at best, problematic, taking place in the midst of a
highly emotionally charged debate. Pharmacologically, when
cannabis is ingested the primary psycho-active ingredient,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), rapidly disappears from the
blood plasma and is taken up in fat where it remains with a half
life decay rate of 5-7 days. This means that following a single
dose of THC, less than 1% of the primary active ingredient
remains in fatty tissue after approximately 35-50 days [10].
THC's oil solubility, and thus its high affinity for fatty
tissue, probably accounts for its attraction to neural tissue
with its high lipid content. Although, in the case of light to
moderate cannabis users THC can be detected in body fluids for
approximately 30 days after the last consumption, it is quite
difficult to detect perceptual-motor effects this long after a
given average single dose (1-3 mg THC in cannabis to be smoked).
This is unlike alcohol where a clear dose/response curve is
demonstrable in which effects of ethanol on behaviour and
judgement can be demonstrated at blood levels below 0.05% [11].</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">These properties of long half-life and
high intoxicant activity of THC have been a major confounding
factor in previous clinical and closed ward behavioural and
performance studies of the effects of cannabis in humans [9]. The
high dose rates of the typical chronic cannabis user recruited
for many of these studies, when taken in the context of the
relatively long half-life of THC, suggest that behavioural and
psychological tests conducted on chronic users, who are
supposedly no longer using cannabis, are, in fact, being carried
out on individuals still somewhat intoxicated [9, 12]. Hence, any
ascriptions of permanent neurological, behavioural, cognitive or
affective changes due to cannabis are often confounded. In
addition, as will be argued later in this paper, cannabis appears
to facilitate the learning of cognitive styles which emphasize
capacities quite different from and contrary to those required
for doing well on most psychological performance tests.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">From the recent work of Herkenham <i>et
al</i> [13] in mapping the distribution of cannabis binding sites
in the brain there is no doubt that the cannabinols have
affinities for certain brain structures. However, it is as yet
unclear as to whether cannabis has any predictable specific
behavioural, cognitive, and/or affective consequences resulting
from the particular receptor site bindings mapped in their study.
To date it is not possible to describe a unique and repeatable
constellation of psychological responses to the action of the
cannabinols as is possible for the opiate derivatives or the
neuroleptic compounds used in the treatment of schizophrenia [9].
This observation alone must cast some considerable doubt on most
psychopharmacological ascriptions made for the actions of the
cannabinols in the human central nervous system.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">There is little doubt, however, that
cannabis has some effect on the nervous system during acute
intoxication. This can be seen from the wide variety of
psychological changes reported by users and observed by
researchers. Weller [14] summarizes a number of findings across a
variety of studies which purport to delineate psychological
profiles due to the effect of cannabis. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">One study found that marijuana users
were more impulsive and nonconforming than nonusers. Another
study discovered more &quot;psychiatric impairment&quot; in users
based on personality tests. A self-administered drug survey
conducted at two colleges found that users were less likely to be
at the top of their class, had looser religious ties, and were
more dissatisfied with school. They were also more likely to be
bored, anxious, cynical, disgusted, moody, impulsive, rebellious,
or restless. In still another study, marijuana users were more
opposed than nonusers to external control and likely to use the
drug to relieve tension (p.101).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">However, he criticises these
characterisations by arguing that little effort has been made to
determine the personality types and differences before subjects
became involved in a cannabis 'lifestyle'. Thus, it is arguable
that any ascription of personality type or permanent behavioural
effects of cannabis on users must be seen as somewhat spurious.
This logical error of explaining the behaviour of cannabis users,
<i>post hoc,</i> in the absence of within-subject controls,
appears to be a commonly repeated one throughout the cannabis
literature. On the other hand, Weil's [15] argument that cannabis
is an &quot;active placebo&quot; (p. 95), which facilitates
already existent covert behaviours and pathologies, offers an
equally credible explanation for most observations made
concerning pathological syndromes associated with cannabis use.
In addition, Weil's view has the added benefit of accounting for,
in part, the great variation seen from individual to individual
when intoxicated with THC. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">One such constellation of behaviours,
which has been repeatedly claimed as a unique nosological entity
peculiar to chronic cannabis users, has been labelled
'amotivational syndrome' [2, 3, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
McGlothlin and West first reported that regular cannabis use can
lead to the development of passive, inward-turning, amotivational
personality characteristics. At about the same time, Smith made a
similar observation, based on several young marijuana users, that
regular cannabis ingestion leads to a loss of desire to compete
and work which, like McGlothlin and West, he labelled
'amotivational syndrome'. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Weller [14] describes the origins and
general characteristics associated with this hypothesized
syndrome.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">This contention was based on clinical
observation of middle-class, heavy marijuana users referred to
them for treatment. Conforming, achievement-oriented behaviour
had changed to relaxed and careless drifting. Inability to
concentrate for long periods, endure frustration, follow
routines, and carry out complex, long-term plans, as well as
apathy and loss of effectiveness, were noted. Such individuals
became totally involved with the present at the expense of future
goals. They had less objective productivity and seemed to
withdraw subtly from the challenge of life (pp. 95, 98).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">He reminds us, however, that no specific
studies or case reports were cited to support McGlothlin and
West's observations [2]. </font></p>

<p>Other descriptions noted which apparently characterize this
syndrome include: shift or decline in ambition; unproductiveness;
aimlessness; poor class attendance; lack of goals; poor school
performance; apathy and sluggishness in mental and physical
responses; disorientation; flattening of affect; loss of interest
in personal appearance; physical exhaustion; loss of time sense;
difficulty with recent memory; mental confusion; and depression
[14, 21, 22, 45, 46]. Nevertheless, in most cases symptoms
disappeared if marijuana was discontinued suggesting not so much
a syndrome but behaviour of chronically intoxicated individuals
using their intoxicated state as a way of focusing their
resentment of social and parental pressure. Moreover, Maugh
states, from his summary of research conducted prior to 1974,
that the amotivation symptoms listed above have been known to
persist in some cases for up to 24 months after cessation of drug
use. </p>

<p>Weller cites Halikas <i>et al's</i> summary of the medical
literature which suggests a reduction in levels of sperm and
testosterone in men as a result of chronic cannabis use [14, 21].
The latter change was observed in a closed ward situation with
subjects at first showing no alteration in testosterone levels
for about four weeks, followed by a subsequent and gradual drop
in testosterone level which continued until cannabis intake
stopped. This situation reversed itself on cessation of cannabis
intake with levels beginning to rise after one week's abstinence.
Weller concludes that &quot;if testosterone affects aggression
and drive, low testosterone might affect motivation. However,
this relationship must be considered hypothetical without
additional research (p. 102).&quot; </p>

<p>Carlin and Post observed, in the 226 subjects they studied, an
inverse relationship between levels of marijuana consumption and
rate of employment, successful completion of school, present
enrolment in school and the number of years of education
completed [16]. A later study by Creason and Goldman affirmed
this assessment when it was found that high school students who
are heavy users and ex-users of cannabis are significantly lower
on a behavioural measure of motivation than are casual and
nonusers [17]. However, these authors suggest that &quot;heavy
marijuana use is limited to those who are already inclined to low
motivation and depression&quot; (p. 452) and in yet another, but
related study, assessment was undertaken of 237 students in a
Central European sports training facility for lifetime prevalence
of amotivational syndrome [18]. This study, in contrast to that
of Carlin and Post, reveals that 'amotivational syndrome' is not
significantly associated with a history of marijuana use. In
addition to the survey assessments provided by the above studies,
Foltin <i>et al,</i> using an experimental design consisting of a
structured performance task in the presence and absence of
behavioural contingency requirements, found that in a comparison
of cannabis users to no-drug and placebo conditions smoked
marijuana was associated with a greater decrease in the use of
time earned to perform high probability activities during
contingency periods [19]. These findings are interpreted by the
authors as evidence of an 'amotivational' effect which may result
from repeated use of smoked marijuana. </p>

<p>In a large-scale study Mullins <i>et al</i> examined the drug
consumption habits of recent conscripts into the United States
Air Force who were, for the most part, young, healthy and not
psychiatrically morbid [20]. The authors compared 2,842 US Air
Force trainees who had used only cannabis with 1,843 who had used
cannabis and/or other drugs and with a control sample of 9,368 on
whom no drug-using information was available. Comparisons were
made on five separate aptitude measures, on educational level
attained prior to enlistment, and on three measures of
performance of Air Force duties. It was found that every mean
score for the drug using groups was significantly different from
its control counterpart at p = 0.01 or better. The most
intriguing finding, in light of the authors' conclusion that
cannabis causes an 'amotivational syndrome', is that for level of
performance &quot;all means are significantly lower than the
control mean except the means for the cannabis-only group, which
are significantly higher than the control means&quot; (p. 4).
Moreover, the authors argue that the differences between the
cannabis-only group and the other drug groups, regarding level of
performance, may be the result of the degree of drug use. They
assert that multiple drug takers are more likely to be heavy
users as opposed to the cannabis-only group which they claim are
more likely to be light to moderate users. Thus, the lower means
for the multiple drug groups are interpreted as resulting from
the total overall consumption of drugs rather than the mixing of
mind-altering substances which, like the mixture of cannabis and
alcohol, may interact synergistically [6]. </p>

<p>Congruent with the superior performance findings of Mullins <i>et
al</i> are the results of Brill and Christie who observed, in a
longitudinal study (1970-72) of marijuana use amongst 1,380
American college students, that a great majority either
experienced &quot;no effect&quot; on adjustment or
&quot;improved&quot; adjustment with only a small minority
claiming their situation to be worsened [23]. In confirmation of
this self-report evidence the students' grade-point averages
showed no significant difference between cannabis user and
non-user groups. In a similar study on a sample of 560 college
students who were primarily cannabis-only users (85-90%), Goode
found that grade-point averages for the casual and infrequent
users to be higher than for non-users but slightly worse
(non-significant) for heavy users as compared to abstainers [24].
This appears to suggest that 'amotivational syndrome' is not
inevitable amongst a normal college population of marijuana
smokers and the syndrome, if it exists, may be associated with
heavy use only. </p>

<p>In his review of the cannabis literature Cohen reminds us that
the 'amotivational syndrome' is so variable in presentation and
is influenced by the magnitude and type of any premorbid
pathology, that the very existence of such a syndrome must remain
quite controversial [6]. On the other hand, it is the observation
of both this author and Cohen that apparent lethargy and loss of
ambition and goal orientation persist for some time during
intervals of withdrawal from cannabis. In many cases this anergic
condition is apparently reversed after months of abstinence, but
Cohen reports that some clinicians recount what they believe to
be the occurrence of permanent brain dysfunction in some subjects
studied. However, it is interesting to note that Thurlow observed
that cannabis users who complained of apathy and loss of
motivation improved when treated with antidepressant medication
[25]. </p>

<p>Another interpretation of the symptoms of 'amotivational
syndrome' offered by some researchers is that it may be a
facilitated depressive disorder which is brought to the fore by
chronic, heavy cannabis use in a minority of pre-disposed
individuals. Although Creason and Goldman argue for the existence
of an 'amotivational syndrome', they conclude that marijuana
consumption among adolescents exists across a wide range of youth
groups, but heavy marijuana consumption appears to be limited to
those who seem already inclined to low motivation and depression
[17]. Kupfer <i>et al</i> draw a similar conclusion in an earlier
study in which they compare 46 and 44 male undergraduates who
were, respectively, heavy and light marijuana smokers [26].
However, their findings do not suggest any particular
psychopathology associated with either group and these authors
propose that heavy use of cannabis may be related to already
existing depression which is, itself, the source of impaired
motivation rather than frequent marijuana use. </p>

<p>Halikas <i>et al</i> also report a high incidence of
depressive disorder in regular cannabis users who had smoked at
least fifty times in the past six months before the commencement
of the study [21]. Weller indicates that an examination of the
subjects of that study reveals that most were young (mean age =
22 years), middle-class and had been smoking cannabis for an
average of 2 years [14]. &quot;Systematic evaluation revealed
that most of their psychiatric problems predated marijuana use.
About 18% had a history of definite or probable depression before
significant marijuana use (p. 102).&quot; </p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the subjects of many of those
studies which identify 'amotivational syndrome' as a product of
cannabis use have been referred for treatment and hence do not
represent the population of cannabis users in general. In fact,
from the numbers given in many sources, those presenting with
psychopathologies of any kind represent a very small minority
indeed. For example, the 1991 National Campaign Against Drug
Abuse survey of drug use in Australia reveals that 31.9% of
Australians 14 years and older have tried cannabis at least once,
7.1% have used it within the past month, and 5.4% within the last
week [44]. Thus, there are just under a million regular cannabis
users in Australia who apparently function well enough so that
most do not come to the attention of medical or legal
authorities. Therefore, if 'amotivational syndrome' was a fact of
cannabis use, Australian society would unmistakably feel its
impact more directly and distinctly than is actually the case.
One can only conclude that this supposed 'syndrome' may be, in
part, the mis-labelling of a latent affect disorder which, in a
small minority of unfortunate individuals, becomes manifest when
facilitated by chronic cannabis use. </p>

<p>From the findings of Creason and Goldman, it appears that the
effect of heavy cannabis use on motivation is not dependent on
the presence of the drug in the user's system [17]. Although
their work more precisely operationalizes the concept of
'motivation', which is central to the 'amotivational syndrome'
debate, it is, perhaps, too narrow a definition when attempting
to delineate the complex constellation of social-psychological
changes seen in chronic cannabis users. For them motivation
merely becomes <br>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">...the difference between the subject's
performance on a task [solution of anagrams] when working for a
reward and when the subject is not externally motivated [working
for a reward]. A subject who performed better working for a
reward than when not was considered more motivated than a subject
who performed at the same level regardless of whether there was a
reward at stake (p. 448). (Brackets mine)<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">From their results, in which they
observed diminished motivation in heavy users and ex-users, they
hypothesize the existence of a possible intervening personality
variable as the possible distinguishing characteristic which
separates those who are high users and high ex-users from casual
or non-users and &quot;that this factor is independent of present
marijuana use while it does make the subject more likely to use
marijuana&quot; (17, p. 452). In conclusion they argue that there
is good evidence in the research literature to suggest that
intense cannabis use may be limited to those who have an
inclination towards low motivation and depression. Unfortunately,
these authors were not able to assess for any possible
pre-existing psychiatric morbidity or personality differences
which may have indicated either prior psychiatric conditions or
differences in personality driven motivational levels in heavy
users before the commencement of their cannabis habits.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Summarizing thus far: although
researchers have apparently identified a group of cannabis
consumers who undergo some changes in life-style and motivation,
the existence of 'amotivation syndrome' as a nosological entity
seems somewhat doubtful for at least five reasons. First, most
studies cited thus far are unable to disconfound prior existing
psychiatric morbidities from any effect directly caused by
cannabis. Second, and closely related, is the difficulty in
separating cannabis as catalytic facilitator of a covert but
developing psychopathology from cannabis as causal agent in the
onset of depression, loss of motivation, etc. Third, many of the
studies examined above were conducted without properly
contextualizing the social circumstances of those being studied
(e.g., Kolansky and Moore [45]). Research on motivation,
adherence to educational courses and behaviour changes associated
with cannabis use conducted in the 1960's and 1970's are
confounded with the effect of changing social values, rebellious
attitudes to the 'system' and alternative life-style worldviews
which were prevalent at the times of those studies. Fourth, the
research results on and pattern of this supposed syndrome contain
too much contradictory evidence to pass the most basic test of
empirical consistency required for sound scientific
conceptualization as a single dynamic entity. Fifth, and most
importantly from the perspective of this paper, no pre-test,
post-test long-term longitudinal studies have been conducted
which attempt to identify personality traits associated with
chronic cannabis usage.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Returning to the interpretation of
'amotivational syndrome' as given in Creason and Goldman, it can
be argued that the explanatory intervening personality variable
posited by these authors (to account for increased cannabis use
and subsequent loss of motivation in the cognitive,
perceptual-motor tasks typically employed in most performance
studies) is what Tellegen and Atkinson have called 'trait
absorption' [4, 17]. It can be hypothesized that those who become
heavy cannabis users (and show signs of 'amotivational syndrome')
are doing so because the intoxicant properties of THC augment and
facilitate this given personality trait in a manner which is
self-rewarding. Of course, the inherent danger of any
self-rewarding system is the formation of an uncontrollable
positive feedback loop which leads to ever increasing levels of
consumption of the facilitating substance - in this case
cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is being hypothesized herein that the
so-called 'amotivational syndrome' does not represent a specific
psychiatric nosology but is, rather, the combination of two
general factors arising from heavy cannabis use brought about by
a personality-need driven positive feedback loop. With regular
cannabis use is observed: <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">1) a change in cognitive style to a more
'absorptive' state in which externally driven reward systems no
longer predominate with subsequent reduction in a user's level of
achievement motivation; and<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">2) the development of depression which
sometimes ensues either as a consequence of a prior existing
pathology or as a result of the user being unable to sustain the
desired 'absorption' state for reasons arising as a result of
social circumstances, changing self-concept engendered by the
cannabis-induced state and/or the development of increased
tolerance to the effects of THC.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">However, before discussing the possible
mechanisms entailed by the above hypotheses, the personality
factor of 'trait absorption' requires further elucidation.<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>TRAIT
ABSORPTION<br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It has been argued in recent years that
'flow' states of consciousness and/or 'absorption' experiences
may represent a basic human personality trait which has, as its
primary drive, the need to experience the world in a
self-absorbed state of consciousness which is <i>intrinsically
self-rewarding</i> [4, 5]. This need varies from one individual
to another and, in some, the achievement of this state may become
an end in itself. Tellegen and Atkinson describe the origins and
qualities of what they call trait absorption. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Phenomena of this kind, while apparently
overlooked by contemporary academic treatments of attention,
perception, and memory, have been described and discussed widely
in literature on meditation, expanded awareness, peak
experiences, mysticism, aesthetic experience, regression in the
service of the ego, altered states of consciousness, and in the
literature on drug effects. For example, Maslow spoke of the
&quot;fascination&quot; and &quot;complete absorption&quot; that
characterize peak experiences [27]. Schachtel, to whom Maslow
refers, described the &quot;allocentric&quot; perceptual mode as
involving &quot;totality of interest&quot; [28, p.221], and
openness to the object in all its aspects with all one's senses,
including one's kinesthetic experience. We suggest, in a similar
vein, that the attention described in Absorption items is a
&quot;total&quot; attention, involving a full commitment of
available perceptual, motoric, imaginative and ideational
resources to a unified representation of the attentional object
(p.274).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The absorptive state favoured by those
with high levels of trait absorption is the likely basis for all
'flow' experiences. In this state of consciousness the
individual's attentional resources are focused in such a manner
as to enter wholly into whatever is in awareness, whether the
focus be interoceptive or exteroceptive [29]. This totality of
awareness on the side of the 'object' has been called by Sartre
and other phenomenologists 'unreflected' consciousness [30]. Most
of our waking state is spent in 'reflected' consciousness in
which attentional resources are divided between the 'object' and
'self-as-object' so that we are simultaneously experiencing the
'object' and ourselves doing the experiencing. It is in this
latter state that experience becomes memory and hence knowledge
and it is also in this state that we operate in what is generally
understood to be our normal linguistic, discursive mental
processes which includes our usual awareness of the passage of
time [31].</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Irwin further discriminates between the
'capacity' and 'opportunity' for 'absorption' as determining
whether individuals engage experiential states which are derived
from deploying attentional resources in this particular way [32].
Further, the 'capacity' for engaging in 'absorptive' states has
been standardized as a personality construct and is therefore
measurable as a scale (Absorption) on a self-administering
personality instrument - the Tellegen Differential Personality
Questionnaire, and this personality 'capacity' has been found to
be able to successfully differentiate levels of hypnotic
susceptibility as well as frequency and type of reported
spontaneous mystical, visionary, and paranormal experiences [4,
32, 33, 34, 35, 47].</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Finally, trait absorption may underlie
what Weil has argued is a fundamental need in Homo Sapiens across
cultures and time: the drive to engage altered states of
consciousness for both ritualistic and creative developmental
purposes [15]. In traditional societies, such as once existed
amongst the Yakut of Siberia and the Australian Aborigines, an
individual with a strong natural proclivity for altered state
experiences would be, as a matter of course, chosen for a
life-role as shaman or 'clever man' [36, 37]. However, this role
no longer exists in the developed countries of the late Twentieth
Century. Thus, individuals who possess high 'trait absorption'
and/or are inclined toward spontaneous 'absorptive' and trance
experiences may find themselves making a &quot;deviant role
exit&quot; into alternative lifestyles, such as the cannabis
sub-culture, more frequently than those with less 'absorptive'
'capacity' in order to create greater 'absorptive' 'opportunity'
[32, 38].<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>A
RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRAIT ABSORPTION
AND AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME <br>
</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">In contrast to the view that cannabis is
psychologically dangerous in itself, Weil has argued that it
should be understood to be what he calls an &quot;active
placebo&quot; [15]. Weil describes an &quot;active placebo&quot;
as &quot;a substance whose apparent effects on the mind are
actually placebo effects in response to minimal physiological
action&quot; (p. 95) rather than being a direct cause of the
psychological changes seen in users. This effect is attested to,
empirically, by the wide variety of responses individuals make to
similar batches of cannabis in similar situations. Weil's notion,
based on hundreds of clinical observations, led him to argue that
it was highly unlikely that cannabis alone could be responsible
for the very varied psychological responses and effects which he
observed. He provides a useful insight into the reasons for the
varied outcomes seen across cannabis motivation studies.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Because marijuana is such an
unimpressive pharmacological agent, it is not a very interesting
drug to study in a laboratory. Pharmacologists cannot get a
handle on it with their methods, and because they cannot see the
reality of the nonmaterial state of consciousness that users
experience, they are forced to design experimental situations
very far removed from the real world in order to get measurable
effects. There are three conditions under which marijuana can be
shown to impair general psychological performance in laboratory
subjects. They are: (1) by giving it to people who have never had
it before; (2) by giving people very high doses that they are not
used to (or giving it orally to people used to smoking it); and
(3) by giving people very hard things to do, especially things
that they have never had a chance to practise while under the
influence of the drug. Under any of these three conditions,
pharmacologists can demonstrate that marijuana impairs
performance (p. 86).<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It has been argued that most altered
states of consciousness, such as those produced in hypnosis,
meditation and ecstatic experiences, involve deployment of
attention in unique ways with a particular emphasis on the
present [29, 40, 41]. This 'unreflected', unselfconscious
attentional state, which is focused primarily in the 'now', will,
whether induced by drugs or not, interfere with the normal memory
processes associated with the 'reflected' conscious state which
is required for discursive thought and logico-temporal activities
usually associated with memory and task performance.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Thus, this paper would argue that any
discussion of motivation and THC use (and its relationship to
memory acquisition and performance) must consider the possibility
that THC facilitates a free-floating 'absorptive' state which
favours engagement in spatial-metaphoric cognitive styles of the
'unreflected' 'here and now' style of consciousness. This is
partly confirmed by the findings of Fabian and Fishkin who
observe in their study of cannabis and 'trait absorption' that<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">...marijuana users, when asked to
specifically reference the marijuana-high state, report a greater
number of absorbing experiences than when not specifically asked
to reference the marijuana state and when specifically asked to
exclude all drug-related experiences [42, p. 548].<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">It is thus possible that the apparent
memory deficits associated with 'amotivational syndrome' seen in
individuals intoxicated with THC and, who are being required to
perform and attend to verbal, temporal, logico-deductive
activities, are the result of 'time-sharing' between the two
states of 'reflected' and 'unreflected' consciousness. The effect
of this 'switching' is to disrupt the usual cognitive and memory
consolidation processes by constantly interrupting the continuity
of attention necessary for the completion of the memory process.
This 'time-sharing' can be conceptualised as a temporary and
rapid movement out of the cannabis-induced 'unreflected' state of
consciousness (absorptive state) into 'reflected' consciousness
when sufficient 'demand' is present calling the experient's
attention to the temporal, discursive information stream. As soon
as demand falls below some critical threshold required for
attention, the 'unreflected' state resumes thus disrupting any
on-going consolidation and learning process. The laying down of
short-term memory and the ability to attend accurately to
objective (clock) time require a certain level of continuous
background 'self-observation' and rehearsal - which is a central
part of 'reflected' state activity. Therefore, assigning the
cause of memory deficits measured in THC intoxicated individuals
to the direct pharmacological action of cannabis may be an
attribution error with cannabis being primarily a catalyst
(active placebo) for these altered states which are the actual
cause of the failure to process discursive information in the
usual way into long-term memory.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The self-rewarding quality of this
absorptive state will naturally lead to the cannabis user
preferentially returning to absorptive behaviours and cognitive
styles over and again. Of course, this will lead, no doubt, to a
loss of concentration on any performance task in process, thereby
creating a background of anxiety associated with the failure at
whatever chore the cannabis user is currently engaged. Naturally,
this will facilitate further and more frequent returns to the
absorptive state since it will be experienced as rewarding and
the demand of the performance activity as aversive. No doubt, in
time, the preference for the former state will lead to a
diminished capacity to perform in many areas of daily activity
which would likely cause considerable frustration in the
experient. This state of affairs will very likely lead, in time,
to the generation of a sense of learned helplessness which
undoubtedly will exacerbate any depressive reaction or existing
on-going depression.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Weil has argued that our natural
proclivity for altered states of consciousness traditionally has
been facilitated in many cultures by the ingestion of
psychoactive substances such as marijuana and hashish [15].
Although this drug 'high' was once accepted as one in a range of
possible states which humans might rightfully achieve, this is
certainly no longer the case in the West. Thus, the negative
reporting, vis--vis cannabis and performance, may now be
reconceptualized as a value judgement regarding the type of
mental state and hence style of cognitive performance deemed
useful and proper by today's social standards. Put more directly,
researchers are testing cannabis users on tasks which represent
current biases, thus allowing their research to reflect the
prejudices of their times. In other historical and cultural
contexts chemically and contemplatively induced altered states of
consciousness have been highly valued and it is arguable that
most religious traditions have drawn their deeper insights and
inspiration from these experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The capacity of altered state
experiences to open broader existential perspectives and, hence,
new life meanings appears to be part of a growth process
intrinsic to both spiritual and creative life. Further, it can be
argued that these types of altered state experiences are
necessary in the facilitation of personal renewal and the relief
of psychological suffering. Although most of the major world
religious traditions have developed methods for achieving these
altered states without the use of pharmacological agents, in the
age of 'high-tech' medicine, and in the context of little social
or religious support for those 'talented' in the production of
altered state experiences, the adoption of chemical substances
and the attendant association with deviant social groups for
these ends should not be surprising.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The psychiatrist Arthur Deikman suggests
that the bifurcation of consciousness into 'observing' (objective
- 'reflected') and 'experiencing' (receptive - 'unreflected')
selves is common for most people living in the West today [43].
It is the denial of the latter mode, the source of our capacity
for mystical experience, which is the basis of our current
psycho-spiritual crisis and, arguably, the underlying
psychological cause of our destructive alienation from nature. He
asserts that without the cultivation of the 'experiencing self'
we may fail to enter into mystical awareness and therefore be
unable to remedy the psychopathology innate to our present
condition. Thus, from the position advocated by Deikman and from
the previous discussion, the use of cannabis in our modern
industrialized societies can be reconceptualized away from the
notion of a public health issue, to the understanding that its
use is deeply connected to the seeking of personal renewal or the
fulfilment of unmet spiritual needs, which users attempt to
fulfil, albeit inadequately, through ingesting the drug.</font> </p>

</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although the Tellegen Absorption Scale
has been widely employed in recent years as a measure of
personality Trait Absorption, it is argued that this simple score
does not sufficiently discriminate true capacity for Absorption
nor does it reveal the level of opportunity made for absorptive
experiencing. This study operationalizes Capacity and Opportunity
as two additional subscales appended to the Tellegen scale and,
by employing the technique of Principal Components Analysis, five
useful sub-dimensions are generated. Following on from this
Author's earlier suggestion that personality Trait Absorption may
be linked to cannabis use and depression, an exploratory study
was conducted into the relationship of cannabis use, gender,
self-perceived motivation loss and depression to observed levels
of overall Absorption as well as to levels of Capacity and
Opportunity for absorptive experiencing.<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">In recent years absorption has become
increasingly popular as a psychological construct [1]. This
conception of attentional deployment, now interpreted and
codified as a personality trait [2, 3, 4], has found its way into
research areas as diverse as aesthetics [5, 6], hypnosis [7, 8,
9, 10], psychopathology [11], religious behavior [12, 13],
altered states of consciousness [14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
parapsychological phenomena [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
intelligence [25], illicit drug use [26, 27], dissociative states
[28, 29] and medicine [30, 31, 32]. Individuals higher in Trait
Absorption appear to manifest a fundamental need to experience
the phenomenal world in a manner which totally engages
attentional resources in an intrinsically self-rewarding way.
Tellegen and Atkinson describe the absorptive experience as an
&quot;'allocentric' perceptual mode...involving 'totality of
interest', and openness to the object in all its aspects with all
one's senses&quot; [1, p.221]. Further, this attentional style is
total, &quot;involving a full commitment of available perceptual,
motoric, imaginative and ideational resources to a unified
representation of the attentional object&quot; (p.274).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Irwin has argued that Absorption must be
seen not only as an innate capacity for a particular mode of
attentional deployment, but should be understood as comprising
three sub-dimensions: 'need' for absorptive experience;
'opportunity' made for these experiences, as well as one's
overall capacity to have such experiences [21]. He accepts that
the Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS) of the Differential
Personality Questionnaire [2] is such a measure of 'capacity' and
he links 'opportunity' to 'need', which is operationalized as a
slightly reworded form of the original TAS. Irwin's resultant
Need for Absorption Scale (NAS) requires Ss to rate, as either
'true' or 'false', the assertion that they 'enjoy' each of the
items of the TAS rather than simply indicating whether they
experience them or not. However, the connection between enjoying
a particular experience and 'need' for that experience remains
unclear in this formulation. In addition, Irwin's approach fails
to address precisely the issue of 'opportunity' which, logically,
only can be interpreted as the frequency of engagement in
absorptive states which is not assessed in either the TAS or the
NAS.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although it is widely accepted that the
TAS provides a read-out of overall 'capacity' for Trait
Absorption, the items, being true or false statements, fail to
discriminate either the frequency of occurrence or the ease of
access with which individuals experience the phenomenon of each
item. In other words, when answering 'true' to a given Absorption
item, there is no indication made whether this experience
happened once in a life-time or everyday and, further, it is not
possible to ascertain whether an S finds it easy or difficult to
access the phenomena represented by a given TAS item. Thus, two
Absorption high-scorers may be, in fact, quite different both in
their rate of absorptive participation and in their innate
abilities.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Such a shortcoming suggests a need to
expand the items of the TAS in order to obtain, not only a
reading of simple Absorption level, but measures of both
frequency (Opportunity) and ease of engagement (Capacity) as
well. This paper reports the results of using just such an
expanded scale in an exploratory empirical study of the
relationship of Trait Absorption to cannabis use and the related
factors of gender, self-assessed loss of motivation and
self-assessed frequency of depression. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">There appears to be very little in the
literature regarding these issues, but in relation to cannabis,
it recently has been argued that the preference of users for the
drug may be a direct consequence of the ability of the active
ingredient, _-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, to facilitate
self-rewarding absorptive and 'flow' cognitive/affective states
[26, 33]. It has been further suggested that the use of cannabis
may be an attempt to redress an imbalance in cognitive and
affective 'style' in which active, discursive, logico-deductive
cognitive activities are replaced by more passive, absorptive and
flow styles of attention and conscious participation. From this
perspective cannabis use may reflect a means for individuals with
higher levels of Trait Absorption, and who have a preference for
such states, to gain greater access to this attentional mode.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">It thus would seem likely that amongst
regular users of cannabis a higher overall level of personality
trait absorption might be observed. It has been asserted that the
urge to use the drug may arise in some users from &quot;a primary
psychological need which far outweighs the power of those sorts
of external pressures&quot; [26, p. 44] which mitigate against
illicit drug use. This need also may manifest itself in a
preference for cannabis use in that the drug may enhance the
Capacity as well as increase the Opportunity to experience states
of flow and absorption. What follows is a description and
analysis of an exploratory questionnaire designed to assess these
issues.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>METHOD</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">A multi-purpose questionnaire containing
items for several different research projects was administered to
undergraduate students at the Lismore and Coffs Harbour campuses
of Southern Cross University (SCU) as well as to a few members of
the surrounding community in the Northern Rivers district of New
South Wales, Australia. The overwhelming majority of respondents
were undergraduates (98.9%) who were taking Introductory
Psychology during the period 1993-94. This psychology class
serves not only the psychology major at SCU, but was, at the
time, a core subject for Paralegal Studies, Human Movement
Science, Business, general Social Science and Arts majors as
well. Thus, the sample obtained is not dominated by psychology
majors only and more closely represents the student population of
SCU than do the usual collocations of undergraduates drawn from
introductory psychology courses.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The first part of the questionnaire
included some standard demographic items and in regard to the
research being reported herein information was obtained regarding
self-assessments of depression, loss of motivation for daily
chores and frequency of cannabis use. The questions used for
assessing cannabis intake were the same as those employed by the
1991 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) bi-annual
national survey of Australian substance use [34]. A system for
guaranteeing anonymity was employed such that no one, including
the primary investigator, could ascertain the identity of
respondents thus ensuring reasonably honest replies to the
cannabis questions.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The last section consisted of the 34
item Tellegen Absorption Scale [2]. Each item of this scale
requires a 'true' or 'false' response and if a subject answered
'true' to any of these, s/he was instructed to answer two more
questions appended to each of the TAS items. These two additional
questions were designed to ascertain: 1) Approximately how
frequently Ss engaged in the given TAS activity (creation of
Opportunity for absorptive activities); and 2) how easy is it for
the respondent to do so (Capacity for engaging in these kinds of
experiences). Subjects were required to circle a single number
from 0-10 indicating ranges from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all
the time&quot; for Opportunity and &quot;difficult&quot; to
&quot;easy&quot; for Capacity. Unlike the study by Fabian and
Fishkin [27], Ss were not instructed to reference the cannabis
intoxicated state when evaluating the TAS items, but to make
their self-evaluations based on how they are in their usual
day-to-day state.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Participation in the research was
voluntary, but a 10% increase in a subject's final grade was
offered as an incentive for taking part. As a result there was
better than 99% participation rate for all classes surveyed.<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="4"><b>RESULTS</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">A total of 272 questionnaires were
returned in usable form. Of these 74.6% are women and 25.4% men
with a mean age for the entire group of 24.8 years (Median = 20,
SD = 8.9, Range: 17-56). The mean age for women is 25 years
(Median = 20, SD = 9.2, Range: 17-56) and for men 23.9 years
(Median = 20, SD = 7.8, Range: 18-49), the difference being
non-significant but reflecting the predominance of women amongst
the mature-age students. Although there is a good representation
of older students in the Southern Cross University population,
68.5% of the current sample is 25 years or younger in this
sample.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The large ratio of women to men is
accounted for by the fact that the largest single group of
students in this study is enrolled in the Bachelor of Social
Science degree (40.8%) and these students are predominantly
female (81.1%). In addition, Psychology is a favored elective for
those students completing the Associate Degree in Paralegal
Studies (12.9% of sample) and this course of study is generally
favored by women as well (91.4% in this sample). In general,
where psychology is taken as an elective, it is more likely to be
taken by women and in this study the students listing 'Other'
(other than Social Science, Business, Law, Paralegal) as their
course of study are 74% female.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS:
OPPORTUNITY AND CAPACITY FOR ABSORPTION</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">For each case the total Absorption score
was calculated as the sum of all the 'true' responses made to the
primary Tellegen Absorption items [2]. This is typically the
Absorption score (TAS) reported in the literature and has a range
of 0-34. In addition, the totals for all Opportunity and Capacity
sub-items for each case were calculated yielding Total Absorption
Opportunity (TAO) (range/0-340) and Total Absorption Capacity
(TAC) (range/0-340) scores. Next, the individual items for
assessing Opportunity and Capacity for Absorption were used in
the generation of two separate Principal Components Analyses
(PCA). This technique was employed to ascertain the existence of
any empirically-based higher order components which would be
conceptually useful in addition to the three overall Absorption
totals [35]. Varimax rotation was applied and Scree plots of the
resultant eigen-values were made for both sets of variables [36].
Although the first 8 and 10 values for Opportunity and Capacity,
respectively, were greater than one, there was a clear 'break' in
each plot at the second eigen-value, so two-component models
seemed to be indicated in both cases. Although a two-component
solution yielded a conceptually sound grouping for Opportunity, a
three-component model appeared more conceptually appropriate in
the case of Capacity and was thus adopted.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The results of the PCA for Absorption
Opportunity lists the Tellegen items with their respective
loadings for the two rotated components which have been named
'Immersed Entrancement' (Component 1 - C1AO) and
'Intuitive/Imaginative Knowing' (Component 2 - C2AO) and together
account for almost one third of the explained variance (see Table
1). Variables with a loading coefficient of 0.320 (about 10% of
variance) or greater were included in the naming process. Only
variable 13 (&quot;If I wish I can imagine that my body is so
heavy that I could not move it if I wanted to&quot;) did not
reach this criterion on either component, but, since it was
close, was also included in the table.<br>

<p><font size="1">Component 2. - Intuitive/imaginative knowing.
(C2AO)</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font color="#000000">Many of the loadings in the first
component relate to items which ask the subject if s/he engages
in acts of interoceptive or exteroceptive immersion in and
entrancement by thoughts, feelings, nature, sunsets, art, music,
people, etc. Some of the items which load in Component 1 have
synesthetic qualities as well, but it can be argued that
immersion and/or entrancement is fundamental to this type of
experience. Component 2 is composed of items which ask Ss whether
they have imaginal and/or intuitive experiences. The former types
can include episodes of entering into states in which one
experiences the present as one did in childhood or states in
which one can &quot;step outside&quot; oneself in order to
experience the world differently. The latter includes sensing
presences who are not veridically present, knowing what is going
to be said next before hearing it, and intuiting events and
meanings not yet evident to others.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Three items in this analysis appear to
load fairly evenly across both components: 8, 'Understanding
Mystical Experiences', 7, 'Absorbed in Daydream', and 32, 'Images
easily appear'. In items 7 and 32 it is not difficult to see that
there are both immersion and imaginal components to these
activities. But this is not as clear for item 8 which asks
respondents to indicate whether or not they know what others mean
when they refer to mystical experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The second PCA calculated for the
Absorption Capacity items yielded a three component solution (see
Table 2). In this case more than a third of the total variance
was explained and variables loading with a coefficient of 0.370
or higher were used in naming the components. The first component
is called 'Exteroceptive Imaginal Entrancement' (C1AC) and
includes immersion in external stimuli such as sunsets, nature,
music, etc. which can contribute to imaginal experiences such as
synesthesia, seeing shapes in free-form stimuli such as clouds,
or 'becoming' a character in a play. The second component has
been labeled 'Intuitive/Extrasensory Perceptions' (C2AC) and is
associated with the belief that one has precognitive perceptions,
senses presences not there is a physical way, can step into a
radically different reality frame and can perceive meanings where
others cannot. Component 3 has been called 'Interoceptive
Imaginal Entrancement' (C3AC) because of its focus on
introspective and reflective immersion on phenomena such as one's
daydreams, inner images, memories and thoughts.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">In this last PCA only two items load
with approximately equal strength across more than one component.
Variable number 2, 'Moved by eloquent language' loads
significantly on both components 1 and 3. This item appears to
have two aspects in that one becomes exteroceptively immersed
and/or entranced while attending to the external stimuli of
someone's words while, at the same time, these stimuli may evoke
associations, memories and fantasies which then become an inward
part of the total immersion experience. In the case of variable
8, 'I think I really know what some people mean when they talk
about mystical experiences', it appears to be connected both to
external stimuli (other people talking about mysticism) and to
intuitively perceiving, in that the experience itself is an
intuitive encounter.<br>

</p>

<p><font color="#000000">When asked whether Ss had ever tried
cannabis at least once, 75% of the sample responded in the
affirmative with the rate being only marginally higher for men
than for women (see Table 3). The sample showed no statistically
significant dependency between gender and ever having tried
cannabis. The mean age for those had tried cannabis is 24.8 years
and for those who had never tried it, 24.7 years. To the NCADA
question, &quot;When did you last use marijuana or hashish?&quot;
51% responded that they were regular users and, again, there was
no dependency relationship between gender and the responses to
this question.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">It is interesting to note that almost 6%
of those responding to the questionnaire during class time were
actually intoxicated on cannabis at the time and over 8% had last
used it the day before and were therefore likely to be showing
some effects from the drug because of its relatively long
half-life (5-7 days) [33]. The 'try' and 'use' rates reported in
this study are more than twice the national averages which may be
accounted for by the fact that this is not a random sample of the
local population, but a student sample, and, in addition, the
Northern Rivers District of New South Wales has a reputation for
being the center of Australia's 'alternative' subculture.
Responses also indicate that men (64.1%) are more likely to be
current users of cannabis than women (46.3%).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">From a combined score derived from the
NCADA queries: &quot;When did you last use marijuana or
hashish?&quot; and &quot;During your last period of usage of
marijuana or hashish, how often did you use it?&quot; and with
the addition of the question, &quot;On the days you used
marijuana or hashish, how often did you use it?&quot; Ss were
categorized as being in one of three groups: Never-Used,
Past-Users, or Current-Users (see Table 4) [34]. Past-Users were
considered to be those who last had used marijuana or hashish
more than one month ago and at that time their consumption rate
was one use per month or less on average. Current-Users are those
who had used within the past month or more recently and had
consumed at a rate of one per month or more. Again, there was no
statistically significant dependency between gender and use level
when use rate was partitioned in this manner. <br>

<p><font color="#000000">A more discriminating break-down of use
was attempted by dividing the Ss into 'regular', 'irregular',
'past' and non-users, because it was felt that there may be a
personality difference between the high and low ends of the user
spectrum. However, this breakdown produced very little
statistical discrimination between these two user groups on any
of the tests reported in this paper. Therefore, based on sample
size and the self-report nature of this research, a decision was
taken to combine the user subgroups in order to give greater
simplicity and strength to the statistical analysis. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Following on, all component scores,
together with the three total Absorption scores, were used as
dependent variables in the calculation of univariate ANOVAs
across the independent variable of Gender. The results of these
analyses for significant effects are given in Table 5. From these
calculations it appears that both TAS and TAC show only
borderline significantly higher mean scores for women whereas in
the case of TAO and C2AO the differences are stronger. For this
sample it would seem that the primary difference across gender is
the greater emphasis by women for making more opportunities for
absorptive states and particularly those of an
intuitive/imaginative type (C2AO).<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Next, univariate ANOVAs were calculated
across the cannabis use factor for all of the Absorption total
scores and component scores. The results indicate a strong
statistically significant difference across all three total
Absorption scores (see Table 6). From the post hoc tests
performed it is evident the meaningful differences in mean scores
for all three are to be found between the Current-User group and
either of the other two with current users always showing higher
overall TAS, TAO and TAC scores.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Scores for both components of the
Opportunity PCA show statistical significance across the levels
of cannabis use with post hoc tests revealing that, as in the
case of the total scores above, the real difference in means
occurs between Current-Users and either of the other two groups.
C2AO, 'Intuitive/Imaginative Knowing', yields a considerably
smaller probability of a Type I error than C1AO and can thus be
taken as the more important dimension when identifying
differences between the user groups. From this analysis it seems
that opportunities made (frequency) for absorptive activities
emphasize more the achievement of intuitive and imaginative
experiences although immersion, intero- and exteroceptively, is
also important when comparing current to past and non-users. <br>

<p><font color="#000000">In the analysis of the Capacity
components, only C1AC ('Exteroceptive imaginal entrancement') and
C3AC ('Interoceptive imaginal entrancement') show statistical
significance. Here we have a reversal in emphasis from the case
of Absorption Opportunity. In the case of C1AC the primary
difference is to be found between Current-Users and Non-Users
whereas with C3AC it is between Current-Users and Past-Users.
These results seem to indicate that differences between current
cannabis users and the other groups on the Capacity dimension are
best distinguished through immersion and entrancement activities.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">Following the univariate studies of
Absorption across the individual factors of gender and cannabis,
a two-way ANOVA was calculated for all Absorption variables
across both these independent variables looking for interaction
effects. However, only C1AC gives a statistically significant
interaction (F(2,266) = 3.2740, p = 0.0394). The interaction plot
of cell means (see Figure 1) clearly shows that women, who either
never used cannabis or are past users, have higher 'exteroceptive
imaginal entrancement' capacity than men (of those user
categories) with the female past users showing a statistically
significantly higher mean C1AC score than male past users (p =
0.005) or male non-users (p = 0.02). Male and female current
users are very similar in mean C1AC as well as are female non-,
past and current users. However, male current users show
significantly higher exteroceptive absorption capacity than
either never using or past using men (p = 0.007 and p = 0.002,
respectively). This analysis would tend to confirm that, in
general, women have significantly more capacity for exteroceptive
absorption except in the case of current users of cannabis where
men show a slightly higher mean score. <br>

<p><font color="#000000"><b>SELF-PERCEIVED MOTIVATION LOSS,
CANNABIS USE AND ABSORPTION</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">As indicated previously all participants
were asked to rate items regarding self-perceived levels of
motivation loss (&quot;Do you find that you lack motivation for
the normal chores and activities required of your daily
life?&quot;). When a cross-tabulation is calculated for
motivation loss and rate of cannabis use, a statistically
significant dependency relationship is observed (Chi-square =
12.21, 4 df, p = 0.0158). However, two cells of the resultant
table have fewer than 5 items, thus the relationship cannot be
considered entirely reliable even though the chance of a Type I
error is less than 2% (see Table 7). Nevertheless, it is evident
from observing this table that Current Users are almost 50% more
likely to place themselves in the highest motivation loss rank
than either Never or Past Users. In addition, Current Users are
about three times more likely to categorize themselves at the
highest level of motivation loss than at the other two motivation
ranks combined. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Those Ss who see themselves as never
showing a loss of motivation are 4-5 times more likely to be
Never or Past Users of cannabis than Current Users while those
who believe that they rarely lose motivation are fairly equally
distributed across the three levels of cannabis use. On the other
hand, those Ss who rank themselves as more regularly experiencing
motivation loss are more than twice as likely to be current
cannabis users as opposed to non-users and about 1.7 times more
likely to be Current Users than Past Users. Clearly, in spite of
the weakness of some of the cells, there appears to be a direct
dependency between cannabis use and self-perceived motivation
loss with increasing use associated with decreasing motivation in
this sample.<br>

variables were calculated across the factor of Self-Perceived
Loss of Motivation and the significant results are given in Table
8. For all three total Absorption scores (TAS, TAO and TAC)
significant differences were found with those who report more
motivation loss showing the higher levels of Absorption. Post hoc
tests reveal the differences primarily are due to the greater
Absorption means for those who lose motivation more often as
opposed to Rarely. Of the three total scores TAO shows the
highest F-ratio suggesting that those who make more opportunity
for absorptive states are most differentiated from the others.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Analysis of the component scores yields
significance only for C2AO and C3AC. The pattern of difference is
similar to that for the total scores and appears to indicate that
the greater Opportunity made is in the realm of the imaginal and
the higher level of Capacity is for interoceptive experience.
However, all these results for motivation loss must be considered
somewhat weak when taken in the light of the great disparity in
cell sizes (10, 88, 174) and thus would require a larger sample
to confirm.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">An additional attempt was made to detect
whether or not the loss of motivation and cannabis use factors
interact in terms of determining the levels of observed

Cannabis Use and Self-Perceived Motivation Loss, but no

<p><font color="#000000">As in previous analyses, all Absorption
scores were used as dependent variables in univariate ANOVAs
across the factor of Depression (see Table 10). For the group of
total Absorption scores the significances for differences in cell
means are quite strong with post hoc tests revealing a consistent
pattern of the highest Depression rank showing a significantly
greater mean Absorption score when compared to those who are
either Never or Rarely depressed. The results of statistical
tests of the derived PCA components are also significant for
C2AO, C2AC and C3AC with a similar pattern in the post hoc
comparisons as found in the total scores. Here again, the
significant difference in the creation of absorptive Opportunity
is primarily located in the dimension of the intuitive/imaginal

interoceptive activity domains.<br>

<p><font color="#000000">Using a two-way design an attempt was
then made to ascertain whether there were any interaction effects
between the independent variables, Cannabis Use and
Self-Perceived Depression, in determining Absorption cell means.
Significant effects were found for three of the eight possible
variables: TAO (F(4,263) = 2.71, p = 0.0308); C1AO (F(4,263) =
2.42, p = 0.0493); and C3AC (F(4,263) = 2.68, p = 0.0320). As can
be seen in Figure 2, those who report never suffering from
depression and never using cannabis have, on average,
significantly lower mean TAO scores than either Past Users (p =
0.005) or Current Users (p = 0.002) who never report depression.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">For those who have never used cannabis
there is a steady and significant climb in average TAO score
across the depression ranks (p = 0.02, p = 0.02) finally
exceeding the average score for Past Users who are at the highest
level of depression (p &gt; 0.05). Current cannabis users show
only a very small and insignificant rise in mean TAO score across
depression ranks whereas Past Users show a non-significant drop
from the Never rank followed by a rise across the next rank.
Overall, those who have never used cannabis stand out in this
analysis in that increasing levels of self-perceived depression
show increasing mean opportunity made for absorptive activities
in contrast to current and past users who show consistently
higher mean levels of TAO across Depression ranks. Current Users
are over-all highest in TAO mean scores and vary very little no
matter what the rank of Self-Perceived Depression observed (p
&gt; 0.05). Therefore, it would appear that overall higher means
of TAO are connected to current cannabis use rather than
depression, except for non-users, who show increasing TAO which
is linearly related to frequency of self-reported depression.
Past Users fall somewhere between the other two user groups and
at the Rarely and More Often ranks of depression they are
significantly different than Current users (p = 0.03 and p =
0.005, respectively). <br>

Absorption Opportunity across levels of cannabis use and
self-perceived depression. <br>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">In Figure 3 the interaction plot for
C1AO ('Immersed entrancement.') reveals a similar pattern of
linear rise across the depression ranks for those who have never
used cannabis (p &gt; 0.05, p = 0.047). For Current Users C1AO
first makes a non-significant fall between the Never and Rarely
depression ranks with a final rise to a value slightly above the
initial C1AO level at the rank More Often. Past Users show a more
linear, but non-significant, decline in mean C1AO across
depression ranks with C1AO at the highest depression rank being
less than for either non-users or Current Users (p &gt; 0.05, p =
0.010, respectively). <br>

</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Finally, Figure 4 is the interaction
plot for the third significant variable, C3AC (Interoceptive
imaginal entrancement). As in the other cases above, the mean
values of C3AC for the sub-group of cannabis non-users rise
steeply in a somewhat linear fashion across the ranks of
Self-Perceived Depression (Never-Rarely, p &gt; 0.05; Rarely-More
Often, p = 0.001). The mean of C3AC for Current Users starts at a
higher value than the other user groups at depression rank Never
(p &gt; 0.05 for comparisons to both other groups) and rises
sharply, but levels out over the next rank. Comparisons of
Current User means at Rarely with Never Used means at the same
depression level also show significance (p = 0.033) and a
comparison of means for Current User-Rarely and Past User-Rarely
also reveals a strong difference (p = 0.0004).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The change in direction of the plot for
Current Users is opposite to that of the above variables and,
unlike the others, the mean value of C3AC at the highest
depression rank is lower than that for non-users (p &gt; 0.05).
However, the differences in the means across depression ranks for
Current Users are non-significant and represent, as in the other
two variables, the group showing the highest overall absorptive
activity. In contrast to the previous analyses, the Past User
group appears more variable with no significant difference
between the first two depression ranks but a significant rise
from the second to the third rank (p = 0.007).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Overall, it would appear that current
cannabis users show the highest overall mean Absorption levels no
matter how frequently they are subject to bouts of depression. On
the other hand, for non-users of cannabis, mean levels of
absorptive behaviors appear to increase in a linear manner with
increasing reported depression. The Absorption variables which
show this linear progression all appear to relate to 'immersion'
behavior with the variable, C3AC, representing specifically
interoceptively focused immersion. In general, it is in this case
that non-users show higher absorptive activity than either of the
other two user groups.<br>

</p>

<p><font color="#000000">The operationalizing of Irwin's [21]
notions of 'capacity' and 'opportunity' as separately rated items
for frequency of occurrence and ease of participation
corresponding to each TAS item has yielded two useful Opportunity
dimensions in the former case and three useful Capacity
dimensions in the latter. This work thus confirms his initial
conjecture regarding the importance of looking beyond the raw TAS
score as the sole discriminative agent in studies employing Trait
Absorption as a predictive variable. In this study the calculated
component scores are capable of not only refining prediction by
providing useful measures of frequency and true capacity, but
they appear to yield finer discriminations through the use of the
sub-attributes capable of making more specific determinations
about the role of Absorption in behavior and cognition.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">For example, in this sample when
discriminating between the sexes, the TAS only provides a minimal
significant separation which gives no clue as to how men and
women differ in attentional behavior or style. The differences
found on the TAO and C2AO subscales provide a stronger
separation, however, indicating that women appear to make more
opportunities for these sorts of experiences and that the type of
experiences apparently sought are of an intuitive and imaginal
nature. Further, when combining the gender analysis with the rate
of cannabis use, this survey indicates that women have more
capacity for exteroceptive absorptive engagement with the
exception being current users of cannabis where men and women are
statistically indistinguishable. To a degree, through the use of
Absorption as a predictor, this analysis confirms a stereotype of
women as being more interpersonally engaged, by the fact that
they demonstrate more frequent intuitive behavior which tends to
be focused outwardly.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Of course, in the case of cannabis use
alone the TAS, TAO and TAC scores are all strong discriminators
of cannabis users from lower scoring past and non-users. In this
situation both components of the Opportunity PCA show the same
pattern of significant difference as for the total scores but
with the intuitive/imaginal dimension being a somewhat stronger
discriminator. This difference may indicate that, although making
opportunities for interoceptive and exteroceptive deployment of
absorbed attention is a significant aspect of being a cannabis
user, the seeking of intuitive ways of knowing may be an even
more important motivator for cannabis users to make opportunities
for absorption. On the other hand, when examining participants'
capacity for Absorption, only C1AC and C3AC are useful
discriminators of cannabis use, thus the difference in capacity
for absorption appears to be mainly in the ability to deploy
attention inwardly or outwardly in a highly immersed manner.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000">The positive connection between
increased TAS, TAO and TAC to higher levels of self-perceived
motivation loss may be understood as either being caused by the
effect of cannabis on motivation or as a by-product of the
preference for the more passive behavior which obviously would be
a consequence of being in an absorptive state. When the results
of examining the component scores are added to the analysis,
there appears to be a related, albeit less strong, relationship
between motivation and absorption similar to the cannabis use
pattern with the exception that exteroceptive immersion does not
reach a significant difference. Recalling that there is a
definite dependency relationship between cannabis use and
motivation loss, it is difficult to disconfound the effect seen
here from that for cannabis. It is thus difficult to interpret
the meaning of these results without a more rigorous experimental
design in which cannabis use and motivation loss can be
disentangled. However, it is also noteworthy that post hoc tests
reveal that the primary effect for motivation loss is to be found
between the More Often and Rarely levels which may be indicative
of different underlying causes and/or personality types involved.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The strong, positive relationship of
increasing absorption activity, as reflected in the three total
scores, to increasing levels of self-perceived depression cannot,
as in the case of motivation, be understood as merely a secondary
result of a dependency between cannabis use and depression.
Although there may be some overlapping variance between these two
factors, as witnessed by similarities in Opportunity and Capacity
found regarding absorption in cannabis use, component score means
in this instance show significantly greater capacity for
intuitive knowing for those reporting more instances of
depression. Thus, it would seem that a primary observable
difference amongst groups of differing levels of depression is
their differing capacity to enter into intuitive and imaginal
experiences.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">The interaction between depression and
cannabis use for Absorption highlights further the real
differences in absorptive frequency and capacity across these two
factors. Overall, current users of cannabis have more capacity
and make more opportunities to engage the world in an absorptive
way with the level of depression apparently being irrelevant.
Past cannabis users show a slightly more varied but related
pattern, but non-users of cannabis reveal a strong positive
relationship between self-reported depression and the rate of
making opportunities and having capacity for absorptive
experience. The latter situation makes more sense when we
consider that, in addition to this pattern existing for total
opportunity, the intero-, exteroceptive opportunity and the
interoceptive capacity components show a similar progression
which can be interpreted as increasing depression leading to
increasing time spent introspectively inward dwelling. Or,
conversely, those who have a higher innate capacity for
interoceptive immersion may make more opportunities for deploying
attention inwardly which may become part of the mechanism in the
etiology of increasing bouts of depression.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">Although the data suggest that there is
no dependency relationship between depression and cannabis use,
increasing use of cannabis is strongly associated with decreasing
motivation. Again, it is not possible to surmise from this
exploratory model what, if any, is the causal connection.
However, it can be hypothesized that increasing motivation loss
due to increasing use of cannabis may lead to a decrease in
external physical participation with an attendant increasing role
as 'observer'. For those high in overall absorption this may be
self-rewarding, thus leading to a life style where total
deployment of attentional resources, externally or internally,
becomes one of the primary activities of 'participation' in the
life process. Furthermore, part of the enjoyment of this role of
'absorbed observer' may come from the increasing frequency of
imaginal and intuitive experiences which appear to accompany
external and/or internal attentional immersion. In the case of
past users of cannabis, however, the general levels of absorption
are somewhat less and, as a result, the associated life-style and
activities may not have provided enough reward to overcome the
negative reinforcement of whatever was perceived to be lost
through the use of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000">On the other hand, greater capacity for
interoceptive deployment of attention may be connected to
increasing depression for cannabis users and non-users alike, if,
as suggested, inward dwelling is part of the etiology of
depression.. Although no significant difference was found on this
capacity component for cannabis users, the plot of Figure 4
reveals a jump in this capacity for users from those who never
have depression to those who do. However, it would require
carefully controlled experimental studies to disentangle the
causal web underlying Absorption, cannabis and depression.</font>

<h1>I. Introduction </h1>

<p>The modern era of research into the effects of cannabis in man
began less than 20 years ago. Many issues about its health
hazards, as they are with all drugs, remain controversial and
ambiguous. Many adverse reactions to drugs were not recognized
until after much exposure had occurred. Often these are
idiosyncratic or allergic reactions. On the other hand, adverse
reactions due to the extensions of the pharmacological action of
a drug may be recognized both early and late. A similar pattern
holds for cannabis. The ambiguity currently surrounding the
health hazards of cannabis may be attributed to a number of
factors besides those which ordinarily prevail. First, it has
been difficult to either prove or disprove health hazards in man
from animal studies. When such studies of cannabis reveal
possible harmful effects, the doses used are often large and the
treatment is generally short. Second, cannabis is still used
mainly by young persons in the best of health. Fortunately, the
pattern of use is more often one of intermittent rather than
regular use, the doses of drug usually being relatively small.
This factor might lead to an underestimation of the potential
impact of cannabis on health. Third, cannabis is often used in
combination with tobacco and alcohol, among licit drugs, as well
as a variety of other illicit drugs. Thus, potential health
hazards from cannabis may be difficult to distinguish from those
of concomitantly used drugs. Finally, the whole issue of cannabis
use is so laden with emotion that serious investigations of
health hazards of the drug have been colored by the prejudices of
the experimenter, either for or against the drug as a potential
hazard to health. </p>

<p>Assessment of the therapeutic potentials of marijuana is also
clouded by prejudices, either for or against the drug. Virtually
every claim of therapeutic benefit made for marijuana is for a
condition for which there are already many effective treatments.
Thus, to justify the use of the new agent, it must be subjected
to the same elements of proof as a brand-new drug. Thus far, none
of the potential indications has been officially recognized. </p>

<p>This report will focus on three main areas: (a) acute and
chronic effects of cannabis in humans; (b) issues regarding its
possible adverse effects on health, including its effects on
driving ability; and (c) the therapeutic potential of cannabis
constituents or synthetic homologs of such constituents. </p>

<hr>

<h1>II. Acute and Chronic Effects of Cannabis in Humans</h1>

<h2>A. Acute Studies </h2>

<p>The availability of synthetic
trans-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major component of
cannabis, and the chemical techniques for quantifying its content
in cannabis preparations and in blood have made possible for the
first time pharmacological studies which provide some precision
in dose. When the material is smoked, as it is most commonly used
in North America, a variable fraction of THC is lost by smoke
escaping into the air or exhaled from the respiratory dead space.
Relatively little is lost by pyrolysis, since it is likely that
the cannabinoid is volatilized in advance of the burning segment
of the cigarette. The efficiency of the delivery of a dose by
smoking has been estimated to be about 18%, but frequent smokers
obtain 23%, while infrequent users obtain only 10% (110). THC and
marijuana extracts are also active by mouth; the systemic
bioavailability of oral administration is only about 6%,
one-third that from smoking (130). </p>

<p>When smoked, THC is rapidly absorbed, and effects appear
within minutes, If marijuana is of low potency, effects may be
subtle and brief. Seldom do they last longer than 2 to 3 h after
a single cigarette, although users prolong the effects by
repeated smoking. Oral doses delay the onset of symptoms for 30
min to over 2 h, as well as prolonging the span of action of the
drug. </p>

<p>These time schedules are consistent with knowledge of the
pharmacokinetics of the drug. Smoking is similar to i.v.
administration in producing maximum plasma concentrations early,
while p.o. administration produces slower rises of maximum plasma
concentrations, which are also lower than those for smoking (105,
130). Although the route of administration affects the time
course and the intensity of cannabis effects in man, the pattern
of these effects was well established by early investigators (84,
88). </p>

<p>All observers have commented on the constant increase in pulse
rate, often one of the first effects of the drug. Blood pressure
tends to fall slightly or remains unchanged; at higher doses,
orthostatic hypotension occurs. </p>

<p>Conjunctival reddening is also consistently observed. Both
this symptom and the increased pulse rate correlate quite well in
time with the appearance and duration of psychic effects of the
drug, as well as the plasma concentrations of the drug (6).
Muscle strength is decreased. Appetite is consistently augmented,
along with an increased food intake (80). Observed physiological
effects have not included changes in pupil size, respiratory
rate, or deep tendon reflexes. </p>

<p>Perceptual and psychic changes are biphasic. An initial period
of euphoria or &quot;high&quot; is followed by drowsiness. Time
sense is altered, hearing is less discriminant, and vision is
apparently sharper with many visual distortions. </p>

<p>Depersonalization, difficulty in concentrating and thinking,
dream-like states are prominent. Many of these symptoms are
similar to those produced by psychotomimetics. </p>

<p>The effects that users derive from cannabis are extremely
variable. Some of this variability depends on individual
variation in degree of tolerance to the drug, based on prior use.
Although it is customary to ascribe some variability to
difference in setting, i.e., the type of conditions and
surroundings which prevail during the drug use, or to set, i.e.,
the expectations of the user, proving the effects of either has
been difficult. </p>

<p>One study indicated that, with pharmacologically active doses
of the drug, extreme variations in setting produced little
alteration of drug effects, which were clearly different from
those produced by placebo (82). </p>

<h2>B. Chronic Studies</h2>

<p>The effects of chronic use of cannabis are more to the point
when considering the issues of its status as a possible social
drug. Three large-scale field trials of cannabis users have been
implemented, but the results of these trials have done little to
allay apprehensions about the possible ill effects of chronic
use. Objections have been made about the small samples used, the
sampling techniques, and the adequacy of the studies performed. </p>

<p>Jamaica is a country in which cannabis is widely used, under
the name ganja. </p>

<p>The content of THC in native cannabis is generally high,
estimated at severalfold that of cannabis generally supplied to
users in North America. </p>

<p>The average Jamaican user smokes seven to eight cannabis
cigarettes a day, such use not being considered deviant in that
country. Sixty adult workers, all men, were selected for study.
Thirty were ganja smokers, and thirty were not, although the
latter may have used cannabis tea. Extensive studies in the
hospital revealed no significant physical abnormalities between
the two groups. The smokers were found to be at greater risk of
functional hypoxia, which might have been due to the fact that
tobacco was also used by this group. Smokers claimed to use
cannabis to work better, but evidence in a selected subgroup
supported slightly decreased performance. The small sample and
the fact that impairment may be difficult to detect in unskilled
workers make it difficult to be sanguine about these generally
negative results (147). </p>

<p>A similar study was done in Costa Rica, another country in
which cannabis use is prevalent. Two groups of 80 subjects, users
and nonusers, were compared by a variety of clinical and
laboratory examinations. Essentially no difference between the
two groups was detected (34). Forty-seven chronic users of
hashish in Greece were compared with 40 nonusers, focussing
primarily on tests of brain damage. No evidence of abnormality in
function as judged by a variety of tests could be detected in the
hashish group as compared with the others. The hashish users had
a higher prevalence of personality disorders, probably unrelated
to their use of hashish but possibly contributing to it (49). </p>

<p>If field studies fail to provide evidence of harm from
prolonged use of cannabis, it is unlikely that experimental
studies will do better, and such has been the case. The results
of a 30-day high-dose cannabis study in which doses up to 210 mg
of THC per day were administered p.o. to volunteers were most
remarkable in how well the subjects tolerated such large doses
(93). </p>

<p>Tolerance was probably present in most subjects prior to the
study, but it was rapidly augmented during it. Under these
conditions, a mild withdrawal reaction was found when the drug
was abruptly discontinued. Additional unanticipated findings were
weight gain, bradycardia, and an absence of psychotomimetic
effects. As the amount of drug absorbed from p.o. administration
may be small, these results are only partially applicable to
smoking. </p>

<p>A longer experimental study in which cannabis was smoked
rather than taken p.o. exposed subjects from 35 to 198 mg of THC
daily for 78 days. The unique contribution of this study was the
discovery of the effects of cannabis in lowering intraocular
pressure. Other effects noted were lowering of serum testosterone
levels, airway narrowing after heavy use, lack of chromosomal
alteration, and unchanged immune responses (35). Other effects of
chronic cannabis use are related in a specific publication of the
New York Academy of Sciences on chronic cannabis use (31). </p>

<p>In summary, we have a very good idea of the acute effects of
cannabis, although these are tempered by the dose of THC, the
route of administration of the previous exposure of the user to
the drug, and possibly by their past experiences with it. The
effects of chronic use are somewhat less certain. </p>

<p>Experimental studies suggest that tolerance develops rapidly,
that a mild withdrawal reaction may occur, and that some acute
effects may be reversed (for instance, a slow heart rate with
chronic use rather than a rapid one as seen with acute use).
Field studies have failed to detect any major health consequences
from chronic heavy use of cannabis, but these studies have many
deficiencies, most studies being far too small to pick up unusual
or rare consequences that could be of great importance.
Nonetheless, one is forced to conclude that cannabis is a
relatively safe drug as social drugs go. To date it compares
favorably with tobacco and alcohol, if not caffeine. One should
bear in mind, however, the very long time that it took to
determine the ill effects of these accepted social drugs. </p>

<h1>III. Possible Adverse effects of Cannabis on Health</h1>

<h2>A. Immunity</h2>

<p>A number of in vitro studies, using both human and animal
material, suggest that cell-mediated immunity may be impaired
after exposure to cannabis. </p>

<p>Clinically, one might assume that sustained impairment of
cell-mediated immunity might lead to an increased prevalence of
malignancy, as seen in the current epidemic of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). No such clinical evidence has been
discovered. Despite some degree of impairment of immune
responses, the remaining immune function may be adequate,
especially in the young person who are the major users of
cannabis. </p>

<p>An impairment of cellular immunity in 51 chronic users of
cannabis was shown by inhibition of lymphocyte blastogenesis from
mitogen, phytohemagglutinin (171). A decrease in T-lymphocytes
was found in 9 of 23 chronic cannabis users, employing rosette
formation as a way of quantifying T-lymphocytes; the number of
total lymphocytes was not different from nonusers (66). Thus, two
early studies suggested that T-lymphocytes might be decreased in
number as well as in ability to respond to an immunologic
challenge. immunosuppression was shown in animals by prolonged
allogenic skin graft survival, inhibited primary antibody
production to sheep erythrocytes, and a diminished blastogenic
response (109). </p>

<p>Further studies have tended to confirm an immunosuppressant
action of cannabis in animals, whether the material was given
p.o. or injected i.p. (144, 185). Mice treated with THC and
challenged with gram-negative bacteria showed enhanced
susceptibility (19). However, others using in vitro techniques
for studying lymphocytes, have found no alteration in nucleic
acid synthesis in the presence of as much as 10.6 x 10-4 M
concentrations of THC (137). </p>

<p>Effects of cannabis on T-cells may be transitory. Smoking of
cannabis temporarily decreased T-cell function in 13 chronic
users as compared with 9 matched nonsmokers, but the effects
varied from subject to subject and were closely related to the
time the blood samples were drawn (134). Although early T-cell
rosette formation was impaired in ten chronic cannabis smokers,
despite a normal total of circulating T-cells, the absence of
clinical evidence of greater disease susceptibility among such
subjects makes this observation of dubious clinical importance
(45, 126). </p>

<p>Other studies cast doubt on some of the earlier positive
observations of impaired cellular immunity. Dinitrochlorobenzene
is used as a skin test for intact delayed hypersensitivity,
mediated by cellular immunity. No differences were observed in 34
chronic marijuana smokers as compared with 279 nonsmokers (152).
The response of cultured lymphocytes from 12 long-term smokers of
cannabis to two mitogens was not impaired as contrasted with
lymphocytes from nonsmokers (178). Even the ingestion of cannabis
in amounts of 210 mg daily of THC failed to alter the response of
the subjects lymphocytes to mitogen stimulation (103). </p>

<p>In summary, evidence is difficult to interpret concerning a
possible suppressant effect of cannabis on cell-mediated
immunity. If suppression occurs, it may only be transient, in the
sense that recovery can occur. </p>

<p>Further, the degree may not be clinically significant as the
reserve capacity of the body to respond to immune challenge may
not be exceeded. We simply do not know how much impairment is
necessary to make someone vulnerable. </p>

<p>Clinical experience has not yet indicated an increased
vulnerability of cannabis users, but further observations of the
possible contribution of marijuana use to the susceptibility to
develop AIDS must be awaited. </p>

<h2>B. Chromosomal Damage </h2>

<p>Adverse effects on chromosomes of somatic cells have been
especially controversial. The techniques of human cytogenetic
studies still leave much to be desired. Assessing damage to
chromosomes is more of an art than a science. Interpretations are
highly subjective, and it is often difficult to get agreement
between any two readers of the same slide. Further, processing of
cells to make chromosomal preparations may differ from one
laboratory to another, so that it is possible to get conflicting
results from the same specimen even when read by the same reader.
One needs only recall the controversy about chromosomal damage
from lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) a few years ago to
interpret any reports of chromosomal damage with great caution.
As similar types and degrees of chromosomal alteration have been
reported in association with other drugs commonly used in medical
practice, without any clinical evidence of harm, the significance
of such changes remains unclear. Early reports were positive, but
more recent reports were negative. A significant increase (3.4
versus 1.2%) of chromosomal abnormalities was reported in
marijuana users as compared to nonusers (155). </p>

<p>Changes were largely breaks or translocations of chromosomes.
More of the latter were found in chronic cannabis users than in
nonusers, but when breaks were included in the counts, the
differences vanished (76). No increase in chromosomal breaks was
found in cells from subjects taking p.o. hashish extract (which
contains THC as well as cannabinol), marijuana extract
(containing only THC) or synthetic THC (128). After 72 days of
chronic smoking of cannabis, no increase in break frequency was
found over that which existed prior t the study (116). </p>

<p>Both the retrospective and prospective studies have flaws, and
one simply cannot conclude that the issue is settled. For that
matter, it has not yet been settled for a variety of drugs,
including aspirin, in which an increased number of chromosomal
abnormalities have been described. One must conclude for the time
being that, even if a small increase in chromosomal abnormalities
is produced by cannabis, the clinical significance is doubtful.<br>
</p>

<h2>C Pregnancy and Fetal Development</h2>

<p>This is another area of great uncertainty about the meaning of
data. </p>

<p>Virtually every drug that has been studied for dysmorphogenic
effects has been found to have them if the doses were high
enough, if enough species are tested, or if the treatment is
prolonged. The placenta is not a barrier to the passage of most
drugs, so the assumption should be made that they will reach the
fetus if taken during pregnancy (3). </p>

<p>This assumption is well validated for THC, based on
autoradiographic studies (87). A high incidence of stunting of
fetuses was seen in mice treated on day 6 of pregnancy with a
single i.p. dose of 16 mg of cannabis resin per kg. No reduction
in litter size or apparent malformations were seen. When the same
dose was given repeatedly from days 1 to 6 of pregnancy. Fetal
resorption was complete (133). Treatment of mice from days 6 to
15 of gestation with THC doses of 5, 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg had no
effect on fetal weight, prenatal mortality rate, and frequency of
gross external, internal, or skeletal abnormalities (50).
Exposure of pregnant rats to either cannabis smoke or smoke from
extracted marijuana throughout the gestation produced less
fertile offspring with smaller reproductive organs in cannabis
treated animals (12, 54). </p>

<p>Pregnant rabbits treated p.o. with daily doses of THC at 15
mg/kg on days 6 to 18 of gestation delivered infants without
visible abnormalities (36). </p>

<p>Injection s.c. of doses of THC up to 100 mg/kg daily on days 6
to 15 of gestation had no teratogenic effect (97). Fetal
resorption was seen in rats treated with s.c. doses of THC at 100
mg/kg for days 1 to 20 of gestation, but lesser doses had no
effect (18). </p>

<p>Clinical studies have also not elucidated the question. An
epidemiological study found more meconium staining of the fetus
and more disturbances of the duration of labor (either short or
long) among 35 users of marijuana as compared to 36 nonusers
(63). However, no significant difference was found between 19
moderate to heavy users and many more nonusers in regard to
several neonatal outcomes (53). Small sample sizes reduce the
confidence of results of either study. A much larger study
involved 12,424 women of whom 1,246 (11%) were marijuana users.
Lower birth weights, a shorter gestation period, and more major
malformations were found among the offspring of users (111). No
changes in serum human chorionic gonadotropin, placental
lactogen, progesterone, estradiol, and estriol were found in 13
women who smoked marijuana during pregnancy, compared with a
matched control number who did not (20). </p>

<p>In summary, it is still good practice in areas of ignorance,
such as the effects of drugs on fetal development, to be prudent.
While no definite clinical association has yet been made between
cannabis use during pregnancy and fetal abnormalities, such
events are likely to be rare at best and could be easily missed.
The belated recognition of the harmful effects on the fetus of
smoking tobacco and drinking alcoholic beverages indicates that
some caution with cannabis is wise. </p>

<h2>D. Cell Metabolism</h2>

<p>Information currently available for the effect of cannabis on
cell physiology and metabolism is limited. Smoke from both
cannabis and tobacco increased the size of cytoplasm, nuclei, and
nucleoli along with an increase in DNA content of human lung cell
explants. Mitotic abnormalities were also noted with an increase
of 10 to 25% over those of controls. Combination of both smokes
produced greater abnormalities than either one alone. Malignant
cell transformation of hamster lung culture was observed after
administration of both types of smoke (108). These findings
suggest that cannabis smoke is harmful to lung cells in cultures
and contributes to the development of premalignant and malignant
lesions. </p>

<p>Cannabinoids may also interfere with the normal cell cycle.
Experiments with protozoan, Tetrahymena, synchronized in culture,
showed a reduction in growth rate during log phase and
lengthening of the mean division time upon exposure of THC. These
changes were dose dependent (183). Addition of THC to various
human and animal cell cultures has been shown to decrease
synthesis of DNA&lt; RNA&lt; and protein (17). </p>

<p>The clinical implication of some of these findings is obscure.
On the one hand, exposure to smoke from cannabis may be
carcinogenic. On the other, the changes in nucleic acid
synthesis, were they to be specific for rapidly dividing cells,
such as those of malignancies, might be useful therapeutically in
their treatment. </p>

<h2>E Psychopathology</h2>

<p>Cannabis may produce directly an acute panic reaction, a toxic
delirium, an acute paranoid state, or acute mania. Whether it can
directly evoke depressive or schizophrenic states, or whether it
can lead to sociopathy or even to &quot;amotivational
syndrome&quot; is much less certain. The existence of specific
cannabis psychosis, postulated for many years, is still not
established. The fact that users of cannabis may have higher
levels of various types of psychopathology does not infer a
casual relationship. </p>

<p>Indeed, the evidence rather suggests that virtually every
diagnosable psychiatric illness among cannabis users began before
the first use of the drug. Use of alcohol and tobacco, as well as
sexual experience and &quot;acting-out&quot; behavior, usually
antedated the use of cannabis (68). When the contributions of
childhood misbehavior, school behavioral problems, and associated
use of other illicit drugs were taken into account, it was
difficult to make a case for a deleterious effect of regular
cannabis use (69). Thus, it seems likely that psychopathology may
predispose to cannabis use rather than the other way around. </p>

<h3>1. Acute panic reaction. </h3>

<p>This adverse psychological consequence of cannabis use is
probably the most frequent. About one in three users in one high
school and one in five in another reported having anxiety,
confusion, or other unpleasant effects from cannabis use. These
unpleasant experiences were not always associated with
unfamiliarity with the drug; some subjects experienced these
adverse reactions after repeated use (7). The conventional
wisdom, however, is that such acute panic reactions occur more
commonly in relatively inexperienced users of cannabis, more
commonly when the dose is larger than that to which users may
have become accustomed, and more commonly in older users who may
enter the drug state with a higher level of initial apprehension
(67). </p>

<p>The acute panic reactions associated with cannabis are similar
to those previously reported to be caused by hallucinogens. The
subject is most concerned about losing control or even of losing
his or her mind. Reactions are usually self-limited and may
respond to reassurance or &quot;talking down&quot;; in the case
of cannabis use, sedatives are rarely required as the inherent
sedative effect of the drug, following initial stimulation, often
is adequate. Occasionally one may see a dissociative reaction,
but this complication is readily reversible. Depersonalization
may be more long-lasting and recurrent, somewhat akin to
&quot;flashbacks&quot; reported following hallucinogens; the
electroencephalogram shows no abnormality (158). </p>

<h3>2. Toxic delirium. </h3>

<p>Very high doses of cannabis may evoke a toxic delirium,
manifested by marked memory impairment, confusion, and
disorientation (120). </p>

<p>This nonspecific adverse psychological effect is seen with
many drugs, but the exact mechanism is not clear in the case of
cannabis as it is in the case of Datra stramonium smoking, for
instance, which produces potent anticholinergic actions. As high
doses of any drug tend to prolong its action, delirium is
self-limited and requires no specific treatment. Highly potent
preparations of cannabis are not as readily available in North
America as in other parts of the world, so these reactions are
less commonly observed in the United States and Canada. </p>

<h3>3. Acute paranoid states. </h3>

<p>It is difficult to gauge the frequency of these reactions. In
a laboratory setting, they are frequently encountered. Quite
possibly the experimental setting creates a paranoid frame of
reference to begin with. That this reaction is not peculiar to
the laboratory is evident from reports in which it has been
experienced in social settings (96). The illegal status of the
drug might contribute in such instances, for while intoxicated,
one might be more fearful of the consequences of getting caught. </p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the degree of paranoia of the individual is also
an important determinant, so that this reaction may represent an
interplay between both the setting in which the drug is taken as
well as the personality traits of the user. </p>

<h3>4. Psychoses. </h3>

<p>A variety of psychotic reactions have been ascribed to
cannabis use. Many are difficult to fit into the usual diagnostic
classifications. Two cases of manic reaction were reported in
children who were repeatedly exposed to cannabis by elders. Both
required treatment with antipsychotic drugs but ultimately showed
a full recovery (16). Hypomania, with persecutory delusions,
auditory hallucinations, withdrawal, and thought disorder, was
observed in four jamaican subjects who had increased their use of
marijuana (71). Twenty psychotic patients admitted to a mental
hospital with high urinary cannabinoid levels were compared with
20 such patients with no evidence of exposure to cannabis. The
former group was more agitated and hypomanic but showed less
affective flattening, auditory hallucinations, incoherence of
speech, and hysteria than the 20 matched control patients. The
cannabis patients improved considerably after a week, while the
control patients were essentially unchanged (146). Thus, a
self-limiting hypomanic-schizophrenic-like psychoses following
marijuana has been documented. </p>

<p>Psychoses in a group of East Indian marijuana users were
predominantly instances of toxic delirium, but those who had
&quot;schizoid&quot; features became overtly schizophrenic during
the period of intoxication (30). The aggravating effect of
marijuana on preexisting schizophrenia has been documented (169).
</p>

<p>However, it was impossible to distinguish retrospectively
those individuals who exhibited behavioral changes in association
with marijuana smoking from those who did not (114). </p>

<p>A controversial clinical report of 13 adults with psychiatric
disorder associated with the use of cannabis included some who
had schizophrenic-like illnesses and one with depressive
features. The majority of these subjects had only used cannabis,
which was thought to be the major precipitant of their disorders
(98). A similar report from South Sweden involved 11 patients
observed over a 1-year period. None had previous psychosis or
abused other drugs. A mixture of affective and schizophrenic-like
symptoms, as well as confusion and pronounced aggressiveness was
observed. The mental disturbances were self-limiting and rare
(132). </p>

<p>It is impossible to think of any controlled trial that could
be designed to detect adverse psychiatric effects from chronic
use of a drug. Thus, clinical reports have long served as the
surest way to detect adverse effects of both social and medically
used drugs. Imperfect as such reports are, they can never be
ignored. </p>

<p>Chronic use of hashish among a group of military personnel was
tolerated quite well. Panic reactions, toxic psychosis, and
schizophrenic reactions were infrequent occurrences among this
group of 720 smokers, except when hashish was used in conjunction
with alcohol or other psychoactive drugs. </p>

<p>Rather, these 110 subjects who used the highest doses (over 50
g/month) developed a chronic intoxicated state characterized by
apathy, dullness, lethargy, as well as impaired judgement,
concentration, and memory (163). </p>

<p>The paranoid psychosis associated with long-term cannabis use
was contrasted with paranoid schizophrenia in groups of 25 Indian
patients with each syndrome. The cannabis psychosis was
characterized by more bizarre behavior, more violence and panic,
an absence of schizophrenic thought disorder, and more insight
than was seen in the clearly schizophrenic group. The psychosis
with drug use cleared rapidly with hospitalization and
antipsychotic drug treatment and relapsed only when drug use was
resumed (164). If there is a true cannabis psychosis, this
description is probably most accurate. </p>

<p>It would seem reasonable to assume that cannabis might unmask
latent psychiatric disorders and that this action probably
accounts for the great variety that have been described following
its use. On the other hand, evidence for a specific type of
psychosis associated with its use is still elusive.
Hallucinogenic drugs have a similar property of unmasking latent
illness, but a drug such as LSD, being much more disruptive to
mental functioning than cannabis, is much more likely to
precipitate a true psychosis or depression. Needless to say, use
of cannabis should be discouraged (as would probably be the case
with most socially used psychoactive drugs) in any patient with a
history of prior emotional disorder (5). </p>

<h3>5. Flashbacks </h3>

<p>This curious phenomenon, in which events associated with drug
use are suddenly thrust into consciousness in the nondrugged
state, has never been satisfactorily explained. It is most common
with LSD and other similar hallucinogens but has been reported
fairly often with cannabis use. At first, it was thought that the
phenomenon occurred only in subjects who had used LSD as well as
cannabis, but more recent experience indicates that it occurs in
those whose sole drug use is cannabis (153). One possibility is
that flashbacks represent a kind of deja vu phenomenon. Another
is that they are associated with recurrent paroxysmal
seizure-like activity in the brain. The most unlikely possibility
is that they are related to a persistent drug effect. They may
occur many months removed from the last use of either LSD or
cannabis, so that it is highly unlikely that any active drug
could still be present in the body. Further, the interval between
last drug use and the flashback is one in which the subject is
perfectly lucid. For the most part, the reactions are mild and
require no specific treatment. </p>

<h3>6. Violence. </h3>

<p>The myth dies hard that cannabis makes otherwise docile
subjects violent. Virtually every experimental study of cannabis
that has tried to measure violent or aggressive behavior or
thoughts during cannabis intoxication has come to the same
conclusion; they are decreased rather than increased. A study of
40 college students focussed specifically on this problem,
comparing cannabis with alcohol. Expression of physical
aggression was related to the quantity of alcohol taken, but not
to any dose of THC (64). Similar findings have resulted from
surveys (162). Aggressive and sexually assaultive behavior in
delinquent adolescents was more common following use of alcohol,
even in those who also used cannabis (168). A review of the whole
subject of cannabis and violence came to the consensus that
cannabis does not precipitate violence in the vast majority of
users. </p>

<p>The possibility was entertained that a rare individual with
some special predisposition to aggressive or violent behavior may
be triggered into expressing such behavior under the influence of
the drug (2). </p>

<h3>7. Amotivational syndrome </h3>

<p>Whether chronic use of cannabis changes basic the personality
of the user so that he or she becomes less impelled to work and
to strive for success has been a vexing question. As with other
questions concerning cannabis use, it is difficult to separate
consequences from possible causes of drug use. I has long been
postulated that the apparent loss of motivation seen in some
cannabis users is really a manifestations of a concurrent
depression, for which cannabis may have been a self-prescribed
treatment (102). </p>

<p>The demonstration of such a syndrome in field studies has
generally been unsuccessful. Cannabis use among working men in
Costa Rica did not impair to any detectable degree their ability
to function (26). Much the same was found among Jamaican
laborers. No signs of apathy, ineffectiveness, nonproductiveness,
or deficits in general motivation were found (38). Each of these
approaches has been criticized on the basis that those surveyed
were unskilled workers in whom subtle impairment might be
difficult to detect. </p>

<p>However, a study of college students came to similar
conclusions (117). </p>

<p>Little evidence was adduced that dropping out of college was
associated with cannabis use. Family background, relationship
with parents during high school, and social values were stronger
forces than drug use. Thus, in subjects with moderate use
patterns of cannabis, no evidence of the amotivational syndrome
was detected (18). A similar survey of college students found no
significant relationship between marijuana use and achievement,
orientation, or actual performance (123). </p>

<p>Laboratory studies have provided only scant evidence for this
concept. A Canadian study showed a decrease in productivity
following the smoking of cannabis. The decreased building of
stools was due to less time worked than lessened efficiency at
work (122). Using an operant paradigm, volunteer subjects on a
research ward worked less as their consumption of cannabis
increased. The decreased work output might have been due to
decreased ability to work rather than decreased motivation (119).
The former possibility is not suggested by neuropsychological
testing of long-term users. No generalized decrement was observed
in adaptive abilities or cerebral functions (24). Similar results
were found in members of a United States religious sect that
relies on cannabis use. They showed no impairment of cognitive
functions on a number of neuropsychological tests (150). </p>

<p>If this syndrome is so difficult to prove, why does concern
about it persist? Mainly because of clinical observations. One
cannot help being impressed by the fact that many promising
youngsters change their goals in life drastically after entering
the illicit drug culture, usually by way of cannabis. While it is
clearly impossible to be certain that these changes were caused
by the drug (one might equally argue that the use of drug
followed the decision to change life style). The consequences are
often sad. </p>

<p>With cannabis as with most other pleasures, moderation is the
key word. </p>

<p>Moderate use of the drug does not seem to be associated with
this outcome, but when drug use becomes a preoccupation, trouble
may be in the offing. </p>

<h3>8. Residual psychomotor impairment </h3>

<p>Almost any task, if it is made difficult enough or if enough
dose of drug is given, can be shown to be impaired by acute
administration of cannabis. More to the point is whether
following chronic use impairment remains a problem. Experimental
studies in rats suggest that it does, but such studies are always
difficult to extrapolate to man (47). A comparison of 23 chronic
users of bhang (equivalent to about 50 mg of THC daily for at
least 5 years) with 11 nonusers revealed some evidence of
impairment in the users. The latter had lower intelligence and
memory quotients with lower scores on psychomotor tests (179).
For whatever reasons, studies of cannabis done in India tend to
show more evidence of impairment than those done elsewhere. </p>

<h3>9. Brain damage. </h3>

<p>The startling report of cerebral atrophy in ten young men who
were chronic users of cannabis aroused a great deal of
controversy (22). The subjects selected for the study were ones
who had come to psychiatric and neurological attention, besides
which they had used other drugs. Even the validity of the method
of measuring atrophy by comparing pneumocephalograms of the
patients with negative controls was questioned. A study in
monkeys provided some support for this observation. After 2 to 3
months of heavy to moderate exposure to marijuana smoke,
electrographic recording changes were noted in the septal region,
hippocampus, and amygdala which persisted 1 to 8 months after
smoke exposure stopped. Ultrastructure changes were seen in
synapses, as well as destruction of rough endoplasmic reticulum
and the presence of nuclear inclusion bodies. No such changes
were observed in animals exposed to smoke from extracted cannabis
(73). </p>

<p>The advent of computerized tomography reopened the question.
Two studies using this technique have effectively refuted the
original claim of brain atrophy. Nineteen men with long histories
of heavy cannabis smoking were examined, and none was found to
have brain atrophy as determined by this sensitive technique
(101). A similar finding was noted in the other study (33). On
the other hand, alcohol has long been thought to cause brain
atrophy, but recent studies suggest that it may be partially
reversible (23). </p>

<p>As brain atrophy from alcohol requires a substantial amount of
use, it is possible that with longer exposure, heavy users of
cannabis might show a similar pattern, but at present this seems
unlikely. </p>

<h2>F. Tolerance and Dependence</h2>

<p>Tolerance to cannabis has long been suspected to occur during
its continued use. Narrative accounts indicate that chronic users
of the drug either show very little effect from moderate doses or
require very large doses to produce characteristic intoxication.
A pioneer study of subchronic administration of cannabis and
synhexyl, a synthetic cannabinoid, suggests at best some degree
of tolerance to the euphoriant actions (180). Yet it has only
been in the past few years that tolerance to cannabis has been
clearly documented experimentally. </p>

<p>The demonstration of tolerance in man was delayed by ethical
restrictions on the amount of exposure permissible to human
subjects. For instance, in an early study subjects were exposed
only to a test dose of 20 mg of THC p.o. and then given the same
doses or placebos repeated at bedtime for 4 more days, followed
by the same THC dose as a challenge on the fifth day. Using such
small doses and relatively infrequent intervals, it was
impossible to show tolerance to the psychic effects of the drug,
although the tolerance to the tachycardia and dizziness produced
by the drug were evident (85). </p>

<p>Other early studies likewise suggested tolerance without
definite proof. </p>

<p>Tolerance to both tachycardia and &quot;high&quot; was
reported following 21 days of consecutive smoking of only one
cigarette a day by experienced smokers. It was possible that
these subjects may have already been tolerant to the drug (46).
Another study, in which subjects smoked a cannabis cigarette
containing 14 mg THC for 22 days, revealed a progressive decline
in the increase of pulse rate following smoking, an increase in
alpha rhythm on the electroencephalogram, and more decrement in
the performance of short-term memory and reaction time tasks
(49). </p>

<p>A number of other early studies provided less evidence of
tolerance. Little evidence of tolerance to clinical effects of
cannabis was found from daily smoking of marijuana cigarettes
over a period of 10 to 28 days (51, 142). </p>

<p>Free choice of marijuana cigarette for 21 days also provided
little evidence to support the concept of tolerance in man (165).
Meanwhile, substantial evidence had accumulated that tolerance
could be shown in various animal species, especially with high
doses of THC given for prolonged periods. </p>

<p>Definite evidence of tolerance to the effects of THC in man
was adduced only when it became permissible to use comparably
large doses over longer periods of time. Subjects in one 30-day
study were given high doses (70 to 210 mg/day) of THC p.o. around
the clock. Tachycardia actually became bradycardia, and a
progressive loss of &quot;high&quot; was noted (49). Similar
tolerance to cannabis smoking was observed in a 64-day study in
which at least one cigarette daily had to be smoked with smoking
as desired later in the same day. Additionally, in this study
tolerance developed to the respiratory depressant effect of THC
(13). </p>

<p>The pattern that has emerged in man, therefore, is that
tolerance is not a problem when the doses are small, or
infrequent, or where the pattern of use of the drug is not
prolonged. Tolerance only becomes a major factor with high,
sustained, and prolonged use of the drug. It is interesting that
no study in man or animals ever revealed any evidence for
&quot;reverse tolerance&quot; or sensitization, such as had been
reported in an early, rather naive clinical study of marijuana
(176). </p>

<h3>1. Cross-tolerance </h3>

<p>THC has effects which in man somewhat resemble those of
hallucinogens and strongly resemble those of alcohol, while in
animals it slightly resembles morphine. No cross-tolerance to
mescaline or lysergide (LSD) could be shown in rats (151). Rats
tolerant to the effects of THC were also tolerant to ethyl
alcohol, but when the situation was reversed, less tolerance to
THC was seen in the alcohol-tolerant animals (127). Perhaps this
difference in sequential tolerance is why THC has never become
established as a treatment for alcohol withdrawal, despite some
early clinical trials that suggested a favorable effect.
Cross-tolerance between THC and morphine has been shown in rats
using customary tests of analgesia (95). </p>

<h3>2. Physical dependence. </h3>

<p>Evidence from both animals and man indicates that physical
dependence can be induced by abuse of THC. All monkeys given
automatic injection doses of THC of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg showed
abstinence signs when withdrawn. when monkeys were allowed to
self-administer the drug for 3 to 8 weeks, the majority had an
abstinence syndrome when the drug was abruptly discontinued. the
syndrome appeared approximately 12 h after the last
administration and lasted about 5 days. it was characterized by
irritability, aggressivity, tremors, yawning, photophobia,
piloerection, and penile erections (95). </p>

<p>In man, a somewhat similar, though mild, withdrawal reaction
was uncovered after abrupt cessation of doses of 30 mg of THC
given every 4 p.o. for 10 to 20 days. Subjects became irritable,
had sleep disturbances, and had decreased appetite. Nausea,
vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea were encountered. </p>

<p>Sweating, salivation, and tremors were autonomic signs of
abstinence (49). </p>

<p>Relatively few reports of spontaneous withdrawal reactions
from suddenly stopping cannabis use have appeared, despite the
extraordinary amount of the drug consumed, Five young persons
experienced restlessness, abdominal cramps, nausea, sweating,
increased pulse rate, and muscle aches when their supplies of
cannabis were cut off. Symptoms persisted for 1 to 3 days (15).
The rarity of reports of these reactions may reflect the fact
that they are mild, and seldom is a user completely cut off from
additional drug. </p>

<p>Cannabis would have been an exceptional centrally acting drug
if tolerance/dependence were not one of its properties. The fact
that tolerance was not strongly recognized as an effect of
chronic use was due to the narrative nature of previous accounts
of tolerance in man and the lack of systematic animal
experimentation. Tolerance has now been proven for most of the
actions of THC. It develops at varying rates for different
actions, but it is rapidly reversible. large doses of THC are
required over long time periods for tolerance to develop. As most
social use of the drug does not meet those requirements, neither
tolerance nor dependence has been a major issue in its social
use. </p>

<h2>G. Endocrine and Metabolic Effects</h2>

<p>Changes in male sex hormones have been a source of controversy
ever since the first report of a cannabinoid-induced decrease in
serum testosterone level. </p>

<p>Decreased levels were associated with morphological
abnormalities in sperm and with decreased sexual functioning
(100). Such changes must require long-term exposure to cannabis,
for subchronic studies in experimental subjects have generally
failed to confirm these findings (118). During the first 4 weeks
of a chronic administration study, no major changes in hormone
levels were detected, but with subsequent exposure a decrease
first occurred in luteinizing hormone (LH) followed by decreases
in testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (99).
Testosterone synthesis by Leydig cells was decreased in rats,
both by THC as well as by other cannabinoids (21). A similar
finding had been reported earlier (57). A review of the
literature on this subject concluded that no significant effect
was found in regard to serum testosterone and that sperm
production was decreased but without evidence of infertility.
Ovulation was inhibited, and luteinizing hormone was decreased.
Cannabinoids had no evidence of estrogenic activity, which had
been postulated earlier (4). </p>

<p>The meaning of such changes in man is uncertain, as the
hormone levels generally remained within the accepted limits of
normal. Further, a single hormone level may not be truly
representative of the prevailing levels of hormones that tend to
be secreted episodically or which are subject to many extraneous
influences. </p>

<p>Data on the effects of cannabis on the female reproductive
system are sparse. </p>

<p>Preliminary unpublished data indicate that women who use
cannabis 4 times a week or more have more anovulatory menstrual
cycles than do nonusers of the same age, Animal work tends to
support this observation. THC administered to rats suppressed the
cyclic surge of LH secretion and of ovulation (11). </p>

<p>Gynecomastia has been thought to be a complication of cannabis
use, especially when it was also possible to stimulate breast
tissue development in rats with THC (72). Eleven soldiers with
gynecomastia of unknown cause were matched with 11 others with
similar characteristics except for gynecomastia. No difference in
cannabis use was found between the two groups (27). Such a
finding does not disprove the relationship between cannabis and
gynecomastia. Indeed, if cannabis increases peripheral conversion
of testosterone to estrogens, then it is possible that the
increased estrogens could stimulate breast tissue in a few
susceptible men. Increased estrogens might also account for some
reports of diminution in sexual drive or in performance in men. </p>

<p>These endocrine changes may be of relatively little
consequence in adults, but they could be of major importance in
the prepubertal male who may use cannabis. At least one instance
of pubertal arrest has been documented. A 16-year-old boy who had
smoked marijuana since age 11 had short stature, no pubic hair,
small testes and penis and low serum testosterone. After stopping
smoking, growth resumed and serum testosterone reached the normal
range (41). </p>

<p>As recent surveys of cannabis use indicate that some boys (and
girls) may be exposed to it even as early as the prepubertal
years, this question is of more than academic interest. </p>

<p>Although cannabis has been said in the past to cause
hypoglycemia, this error has been pointed out in numerous
studies. On the contrary, some subjects showed impaired glucose
tolerance following experimentally administered i.v. doses of 6
mg of THC. Such a dose is probably greater than one generally
attains from usual cigarettes but might be obtained from
high-grade hashish. </p>

<p>The deterioration of glucose tolerance was accomplished by
increased levels of plasma growth hormone, as well as by a normal
plasma insulin response. </p>

<p>these findings suggested that growth hormone might be
interfering with the action of insulin (83). A study in rabbits
indicated that blood glucose was increased by single doses of THC
but that this increase could be prevented by adrenalectomy.
Increased release of epinephrine following THC was postulated as
a possible cause for the hyperglycemia (70). Although large doses
of THC might aggravate diabetes, the rarity of this phenomenon in
clinical practice may be due to the lower doses of THC used
socially or the development of tolerance to this specific
pharmacological effect. </p>

<h2>H. Lung Problems</h2>

<p>Virtually all users of cannabis in North America take the drug
by smoking. As inhaling any foreign material into the lung amy
have adverse consequences, as is well proven in the case of
tobacco, this mode of administration of cannabis might also be
suspect. Smoking is most efficient method for administering the
drug, due to the enormously high lipid solubility of THC. </p>

<p>The pulmonary surfactant is a perfect trap for THC which is
then rapidly absorbed into the blood. the kinetics of the THC
administered by smoking are similar to those of its i.v.
administration. </p>

<p>Heavy use of hashish by soldiers produced a number of
bronchopulmonary consequences, including chronic bronchitis,
chronic cough, and mucosal changes of squamous metaplasia, a
precancerous change (74). Although at first THC was thought to be
a respiratory depressant, more careful studies indicated that it
was when given p.o. in doses of 22.5 mg (14). thus, its use in
any form by patients with impaired pulmonary function would be
hazardous. </p>

<p>Young, healthy volunteer subjects in a chronic smoking
experiment had pulmonary function tests before and after 47 to 59
days of daily smoking of approximately five marijuana cigarettes
a day. Decreases were found in forced expiratory volume in 1 s,
in maximal midexpiratory flow rate, in plethysmographic specific
airway conductance, and in diffusing capacity. </p>

<p>Thus, very heavy marijuana smoking for 6 to 8 weeks caused
mild but significant airway obstruction (161). </p>

<p>Quite possibly such dramatic early changes are not progressive
with continued smoking (171). Compared with tobacco, cannabis
smoking yields more residue (&quot;tar&quot;), but the amount of
smoke inhaled is very likely to be considerably less. The study
in which five cigarettes were consumed daily represented heavy
use of the drug, compared with 20 to 40 tobacco cigarettes which
might be consumed by a heavy tobacco smoker. Low values for
specific airway conductance were found in marijuana smokers, a
change not observed in tobacco smokers. This change indicates
mild impairment of large airway function. No differences were
found between marijuana smokers and nonsmokers in spirometric
indices, closing volumes, or nitrogen concentrations between 750
and 1250 ml of expired air (159). Marijuana smoke inhibits
pulmonary antibacterial defense systems, mainly alveolar
macrophages, in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxin involved
is not related to any psychoactive component (86). One would
assume that marijuana smokers might be more susceptible to
bacterial infections of the lung, yet such increased
susceptibility has not been clinically documented. </p>

<p>The issue of damage to lungs from cannabis is somewhat
confounded by the fact that many cannabis users also use tobacco.
As yet, it is far easier to find pulmonary cripples from the
abuse of tobacco than it is to find any evidence of clinically
important pulmonary insufficiency from smoking of cannabis. </p>

<h2>I. Cardiovascular Problems </h2>

<p>Tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and increased blood
concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin from cannabis smoking would
undoubtedly have deleterious effects on persons with heart
disease due to arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries or
congestive heart failure. Although a slight trend toward
increased use by persons over age 30 years has been detected in
recent epidemiological studies, it is unlikely that many persons
with serious heart disease will be exposed to this hazard from
cannabis use. </p>

<p>Tachycardia is a consequence of almost every acute dose of
cannabis, although some degree of tolerance develops to this
effect. Evidence suggests that it is mainly due to an inhibition
of vagal tone (32). Increasing the heart rate and thereby cardiac
work might be harmful to patients with angina pectoris or
congestive heart failure. A direct test of the effects of
marijuana smoking in exercise-induced angina proved this harmful
effect of the drug. Smoking one cigarette containing 19 mg of THC
decreased the exercise time until angina by 48%. Smoking a
marijuana placebo cigarette decreased the exercise time until
angina by only 9%. thus, smoking marijuana increased myocardial
oxygen demand and decreased myocardial oxygen delivery (9). A
subsequent study compared the effect of this type of marijuana
cigarette with that of a high nicotine cigarette. the marijuana
cigarette decreased the exercise time by 50%; the nicotine
cigarette decreased the exercise time to angina by 23% (10).
Clearly, smoking of any kind is bad for patients with angina, but
the greater effect of cannabis in increasing heart rate makes
this drug especially bad for such patients. Fortunately, few
angina patients are devotees of cannabis. </p>

<p>A rapid heart rate might be expected to aggravate congestive
heart failure. </p>

<p>Actually, little is known about the direct effects of THC on
myocardium. A single study using an isolated rat heart reported a
negative inotropic effect from THC, i.e., weaker contractibility
of muscle (115). If so, the use of cannabis by patients in
congestive heart failure could make matters even worse. </p>

<p>Premature ventricular contractions have been reported
following marijuana smoking (91). However, when subjects were
continually monitored electrocardiographically while smoking
cigarettes containing approximately 20 mg of THC, no increase in
such premature beats was found (145). Ventricular premature beats
are rarely observed and do not seem to be of any great clinical
importance. </p>

<h2>J. Eye Problems</h2>

<p>Eye complaints of cannabis users are vague and mild. All 350
cannabis users had some eye complaints. Several consistent
findings were (a) photophobia and belpharospasms; (b) injection
of the globe; (c) increased visibility of the corneal nerves; and
(d) accommodative or refractive changes. Visual acuity was
preserved, but pupillary reactions were sluggish. Both alcohol
and cannabis produced a moderately debilitating effects on
lateral phoria and abduction. During smoking, lacrimation may be
observed along with the characteristic marked conjunctival
injection. Despite the fact that numerous and complex changes
occur in the eyes of cannabis users, these effects are confined
to the anterior segment and in most respects mimic an irritative
process of that region. they are transient and not cumulative.
the are probably of little clinical significance (60). </p>

<p>Reduction intraocular pressure is a characteristic effect from
cannabis. this action provides distinct therapeutic possibilities
and will be discussed later. </p>

<h2>K. Contamination of Cannabis</h2>

<p>The most definite health hazard was contamination of cannabis,
largely of Mexican origin, by the herbicide paraquat. Inhalation
of toxic amounts of this material could lead to severe lung
damage, and some instances of acute toxicity have occurred.
Paradoxically, this hazard stemmed from efforts to save cannabis
users from less well-documented hazards to their health. </p>

<p>Estimates of the amount of contaminated cannabis reaching
North America may have been grossly exaggerated due to false
positive results in testing for paraquat. Formerly as much as
one-third to one-half of Mexican cannabis was assumed to be
contaminated. the results of later analyses suggest that only
about 10% is contaminated. the problem still remains for the
users as to how to identify such a contaminated product. </p>

<p>One thought has been to look for red spots on the marijuana
leaves. this approach may be difficult for the leaves are usually
available in a finely ground form. A red fluorescence is seen
under ultraviolet light, such as is commonly used in
discotheques. A similar red fluorescence may be seen on the lips
of the smoker of paraquat contaminated cannabis. </p>

<p>After the experience with paraquat in Mexico, its use was
temporarily discontinued. Recently, the possibility that it may
be used against cannabis crops in California and Hawaii has
surfaced. One would hope that over-zealous law enforcement would
not once again pose a serious health risk to marijuana users. </p>

<p>Cannabis is generally harvested like any other crop. The final
product of ground leaves and stems look very much like grass cut
by a mower. usual insecticides and fungicides are rarely used, as
the plant grows abundantly with minimal care. Other sources of
contamination may include insects and fungi. </p>

<h2>L. Possible Accumulation of Drug</h2>

<p>The major if not sole active component of cannabis, THC, is
highly lipid soluble. As the human body has a high lipid content,
which includes not only body fat, but also brain and most cell
membranes, lipid-soluble drugs tend to leave the blood rapidly to
be distributed to fatty tissues. It is characteristic of such
drugs that the action of a single dose is terminated not by the
elimination of the drug through metabolic processes, but by
redistribution to sites in the body where it cannot act. The
prime example of such a drug is pentothal sodium, which rapidly
produces anesthesia when given i.v. but which has a very short
span of action. the drug still remains in the body, but in places
where it cannot act. A similar situation applies to the widely
used sedative drug, diazepam. </p>

<p>An early study of the pharmacokinetics of THC examined its
tissue distribution following a single injection of radiolabeled
material, the concentration of THC in fat was 10 times greater
than for any other tissue examined and persisted in this tissue
for 2 weeks. Thus, there is good evidence that THC and its
metabolites might accumulate not only in fat, but also in brain
(107). </p>

<p>Obviously, similar studies could not be done in man. One can
measure in man the extraction of cannabis metabolites following
single or repeated doses, to get some idea of their persistence.
Following both single and repeated doses (at least single doses
for several days), metabolites of cannabis of cannabis can be
found in urine for varying periods, up to several days following
the last dose (94). All of these metabolites are ones that are
known to have no mental effects, except for a minuscule amount of
unchanged THC which is excreted during the first 4 h following a
dose, while the drug is having definite clinical effects. The
excretion of these metabolites is not accompanied by any evidence
of cannabis-like effects. </p>

<p>We may conjecture that THC rapidly leaves the blood to be
sequestered in fatty tissues. It is either gradually metabolized
in these tissues to inactive metabolites which are then excreted
in the urine, or it may be gradually released from these tissues
in small amounts to be metabolized by the liver before attaining
effective plasma concentrations. In either case, there is no
evidence of a continuing drug effect from this accumulation of
drug in the body. </p>

<p>No one has yet reported on the excretion of metabolites
following prolonged exceedingly high dose administration of THC.
In one study in which doses of up to 210 mg of THC were given
p.o., abrupt discontinuation of the drug led quickly to mild
signs of a withdrawal reaction (49). As the development of
withdrawal reactions is contingent upon a rapid decline to the
pint of absence of active drug in the body, one must assume that
no accumulation of active drug occurred even under extreme
circumstances. </p>

<p>In short, the apprehension about accumulation of THC from
repeated use is based on evidence indicating only the
accumulation of drug that is either in inactive form to begin
with or which is rendered inactive before reaching the
circulation in any pharmacologically active amount. We do not
know the full toxicity of many of the possible metabolites which
might accumulate, but generally toxicity studies of cannabis and
its constituents lead to the inescapable conclusion that it is
one of the safest drugs ever studied this way. </p>

<h2>M. Effects on Driving an Automobile</h2>

<p>If marijuana is to become an accepted social drug, it would be
important to know its effects on driving ability. Fully one-half
of the fatal car crashes in the United States are associated with
another social drug, alcohol. </p>

<p>Neither experimental nor epidemiological approaches to the
marijuana question have yet provided definitive answers. </p>

<p>Many studies have used acute doses of marijuana or THC to
study various psychomotor functions. these can be summarized by
saying that, if the dose of drug was high enough or the task
difficult enough, impairments were shown. It is difficult to
determine how pertinent these tests are to the actual driving of
an automobile. Furthermore, it is difficult to relate the effects
of acute consumption of marijuana, often in relatively naive
subjects, to effects that may be found in chronic users, who may
have developed some degree of tolerance. </p>

<p>Studies on the acute effects of marijuana on simulated driving
have shown mixed results. the first compared smoked marijuana
(doses uncertain) with ethanol in sufficient quantities to
produce alcohol levels of 100 mg/dl. </p>

<p>Marijuana increased speedometer errors but produced no
deviation from the norm on accelerator, brake, signal, steering,
or total errors. Alcohol had a far more deleterious effect (43).
Marijuana administered p.o. in doses of 8. </p>

<p>12 and 16 mg was compared with a dose of 70 g of alcohol in
eight volunteer subjects performing a simulated driving task.
Both marijuana and alcohol increased the time to brake and to
start, but these changes were confined to the 16 mg dose of THC
(138). Marijuana was smoked with the intention of administering
doses of 0, 50, 100, and 200 *g/kg, a most dubious assumption. </p>

<p>No significant deviations from the norm were noted in car
control and tracking aspects (124). </p>

<p>Actual driving in normal traffic situations would more closely
mimic real-life situations, including the dangers. Sixty-four
volunteer subjects smoked cigarettes containing 0, 4.9, or 8.4 mg
of THC. Oddly enough, THC had a biphasic effect, causing
deterioration of driving skills in some subjects and improvement
in others. A recently completed study compared the effects of
smoking a marijuana cigarette with or without alcohol, alcohol
alone, and placebos for each drug. Actual driving was done over a
course rigged with various traffic problems. Both drugs produced
impairment of driving performance, the combination being worse
than either alone (141). </p>

<p>Fifty-nine subjects smoked marijuana cigarettes until
&quot;high&quot; and then were periodically tested by highway
patrol officers on the roadside sobriety test. </p>

<p>Overall, 94% of the subjects failed to pass the test 90 min
after smoking and 60% after 150 min, despite the fact that by
then plasma concentrations of THC were rather low (81). It
appeared that establishing a clear relation between THC plasma
concentrations and the degree of clinical impairment will be much
more difficult than has been found in the case of alcohol (140).
The exact prevalence of persons who might be picked up while
driving under the influence of marijuana is uncertain. One survey
found at least 5 ng of THC per ml in blood specimens of 14.4% of
a random sample of 1792 drivers detained for erratic driving.
Many were associated with blood levels of alcohol as well (184). </p>

<p>Flying an airplane is much more difficult than driving an
automobile, but the general principle of impairment are similar.
Ten certified pilots who smoked marijuana or placebo were tested
on a simulator. The results were highly variable from pilot to
pilot and from skill to skill. It was assumed that the pilots had
regained full function after 4 h (90). Somewhat contrary results
were obtained in another similar study which found, however, some
degree of impairment in flying skills as long as 24 h after an
exposure to marijuana. </p>

<p>The subjects were unaware of any such impairment (182). </p>

<p>The issue is not clearly settled, but common sense would
suggest that it would be unwise to try to drive an automobile
soon after exposure to marijuana. In our first study with the
drug, the subjects were asked during the period of their
intoxication, &quot;Would you be able to drive a car now?&quot;
Their uniform answer was, &quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot;
The biggest areas of doubt are how long the impairment, even
though subtle, may last and how to deal forensically with driving
while under the influence of marijuana. the best evidence at
present would be to assume that any amount of THC more than 10
ng/ml in plasma is presumptive evidence of impairment. such a
decision is arbitrary, but so have been forensic decisions about
the presumed level of intoxication with alcohol. </p>

<h1>IV. Therapeutic Uses</h1>

<p>For many centuries, cannabis was used as a treatment, but only
during the 19th century did a particularly lively interest
develop for exploiting its therapeutic potential. Cannabis was
reported to be effective in treating tetanus, convulsive
disorders, neuralgia, migraine, dysmenorrhea, post partum
psychoses, senile insomnia, depression, and gonorrhea, as well as
opium or chloral hydrate addiction. In addition, it was used to
stimulate appetite and to allay the pain and anxiety of patients
terminally ill with cancer (64, 121). However, the advent of
modern pharmacology beginning in the 20th century discovered many
other drugs more definitely effective in these disorders, with a
subsequent decrease in the enthusiasm for cannabis as a
therapeutic agent. </p>

<p>Advances in the chemistry of cannabis during the 1940s
established tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the major active
component. A semisynthetic THC-like material, synhexyl, was
tested as a therapeutic agent during the late 1940s and early
1950s. Initial trials reported efficacy as an antidepressant and
as a treatment for alcohol or opiate withdrawal, but subsequent
clinical evaluations were negative (156,166). </p>

<p>The exact structure of THC was shown in 1964 to be
delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol, which was soon synthesized.
The relative abundance of this material permitted extensive
laboratory and clinical studies from 1968 onwards. These studies
have included potential therapeutic uses. </p>

<p>At the present time, a number of pharmaceutical houses have
programs to develop cannabinoids as therapeutic agents. The major
problem is to separate the specific desired pharmacological
effect from the pronounced mental effects of cannabinoids. A
number of reviews of the potential therapeutic uses of cannabis
have been published recently (36, 92, 104). We will now discuss
some indications of current interest. </p>

<h2>A Antiemetic for Patients in Cancer Chemotherapy</h2>

<p>Cancer chemotherapy, especially with the agent cisplatin,
produces severe nausea and vomiting, which is extremely difficult
to treat with ordinary antiemetic drugs, such as
prochlorperazine. This complication is so severe that many
patients forego effective cancer chemotherapy. The antiemetic
effects of cannabis had been suggested as early as 1972 (6). THC
was first tried as an antiemetic in a controlled trial comparing
it with placebo in 20 patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
Fifteen mg were given to some patients and 20 mg to the others in
the form of gelatin capsules containing THC dissolved in sesame
oil. The initial dose was started 2 h before chemotherapy and
repeated 2 and 6 h later. Fourteen of the 20 patients in whom an
evaluation could be made reported a definite antiemetic effect
from THC, while none was observed from placebo during 22 courses
of that drug (149). </p>

<p>Since then, studies have been largely confirmatory but not
entirely so. </p>

<p>Fifty-three patients refractory to other treatments were
studied in an uncontrolled fashion. Ten had complete control of
vomiting when THC was administered prior to chemotherapy and for
24 h thereafter. Twenty-eight had 50% or more reduction in
vomiting, and only 15 patients showed no therapeutic effect
whatsoever. However, four patients were dropped from the study
because of adverse effects (113). Fifteen doses of 15 mg of THC
were compared with 10-mg doses of prochlorperazine in a
controlled cross-over trial in 84 patients. THC produced complete
response in 36 of 79 courses, while prochlorperazine was
effective in only 16 of 76 courses. Twenty-five patients received
both drugs, of whom 20 preferred THC. Of the 36 courses of THC
that resulted in complete antiemetic response, 32 were associated
with mental effects characterized as a &quot;high&quot; (148).
Another comparison between THC in 15-mg doses and
prochlorperazine in 10-mg doses versus a placebo control was made
in 116 patients who received p.o. doses 3 times a day. The THC
regimen was equal to prochlorperazine, and both were superior to
placebo. However, many patients who received THC found it to be
unpleasant (55). A comparison of THC with placebo was made in 15
patients with each patient acting as his or her control. Fourteen
of the 15 patients given THC obtained more relief of nausea and
vomiting than from placebo during a course of high-dose
methotrexate chemotherapy (28). Best results were obtained when
plasma concentrations of THC were more than 120 ng/ml. Such
concentrations would ordinarily be expected to produce rather
definite mental effects, THC was compared with two other
antiemetics, thiethylperazine and metoclopramide, in a controlled
cross-over trial. No difference was found between the antiemetic
effect of these three agents. However, adverse effects of THC
were sufficiently greater than those from the other two drugs,
which raised questions about its clinical utility (37). When THC
was compared with prochlorperazine and placebo, the latter two
treatments were not found to differ, but THC was superior to
either one (131). </p>

<p>In summary, it would appear that THC has definite antiemetic
effects, that these are comparable to many other commonly used
antiemetic agents such as prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine, and
metoclopramide, but that the major disadvantage of the drug is
the mental effects produced by the doses given. </p>

<p>A synthetic homolog of THC, nabilone, was developed in 1972
and has been tested extensively for antiemetic activity.
Across-over study comparing nabilone with prochlorperazine in 113
patients revealed significantly greater response rates following
nabilone therapy. However, side effects from nabilone were also
more common (77). Although it was hoped that nabilone separated
the antiemetic effects from the mental effects of THC, this goal
was not fully achieved. Levonantradol and BRL 4664 are two other
synthetic THC homologs which showed antiemetic effects in open
studies (43, 154). The exact role of synthetic homologs of THC as
antiemetic agents remains to be determined. </p>

<p>Currently, a large amount of data on the clinical use of THC
as an antiemetic is being accumulated in therapeutic situations
monitored by the Food and Drug Administration. Unfortunately,
this massive amount of clinical experience has no control, so
that it may be impossible to conclude more than what is already
known. Meanwhile, extremely promising results have been obtained
with larger than usual i.v. doses of metoclopramide. When this
drug was compared with prochlorperazine and placebo, it was more
effective than either, the only disturbing side effect being
sedation (59). The doses used of metoclopramide were 1 mg/kg i.v.
before treatment with cisplatin (perhaps the most emetic
anticancer drug) and several times after treatment. Protection
was total in 48% of courses and major in another 23% (157). </p>

<p>This experience with metoclopramide suggests that the whole
issue of the antiemetic effects of THC may become moot, as there
are other drugs such as domperidone, which may also be effective
in this situation. </p>

<h2>B. Glaucoma</h2>

<p>Discovery of the ability of cannabis to lower intraocular
pressure was more or less fortuitous. Intraocular pressure was
measured as part of a multifaceted study of the effects of
chronic smoking of large amounts of cannabis. Intraocular
pressure was found to decrease as much as 45% in 9 of 11
subjects, 30 min after smoking (75). Lowered intraocular pressure
lasted 4 to 5 h after smoking a single cigarette. Its magnitude
was unrelated to the total number of cigarettes smoked. the
maximal effect on intraocular pressure was produced by the amount
of THC absorbed in a single cigarette containing 19 mg of THC.
When patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma were tested 7
of 11 showed a fall of intraocular pressure of 30%. Confirmatory
evidence was obtained from a trial in which i.v. injection of THC
in doses of 22 *g/kg and 44 *g/kg produced an average fall in
intraocular pressure of 37%, with come decreases as much as 51%
(40). Many experiments done in rabbits using various routes of
administration, including instillation of cannabinoids into the
eye, have confirmed the ability of cannabis to reduce intraocular
pressure. </p>

<p>Topical administration would ne especially desirable for
treating glaucoma as with other drugs used for this purpose.
Smoking cannabis or taking THC i.v. </p>

<p>would be totally unsuitable for patients with glaucoma.
Rabbits have been used traditionally for studying eye
medications. The lipid solubility of THC has been overcome by
using mineral oil as the vehicle for its instillation into the
eye. The degree of lowering of intraocular pressure is at least
as great as that with conventional eye drops, such as
pilocarpine, and the duration of effect is often longer. Some
minimal systemic absorption of the drug occurs when it is applied
to the conjunctivae, but it is of no consequence in producing
mental effects. Other cannabinoids besides THC, such as
cannabinol or 8-alpha- and 8-beta-11-dihydroxy-delta-9-THC, have
also produced this effect in rabbits (62). These agents have no
mental effects, which makes them of considerable interest for
therapeutic use. </p>

<p>An extract of nonpsychoactive components of cannabis whose
composition is still uncertain has been tested both alone and in
combination with timolol eye drops in patients with increased
intraocular pressure. The effects of the two agents are additive
and are said to be effective when other measures have failed
(177). BW 146Y, a synthetic THC homolog, has been given p.o. to
glaucomatous patients. Unfortunately, mild orthostatic
hypotension and subjective effects were noted in addition to
reduced intraocular pressure (167). </p>

<p>No psychoactive component of cannabis can be considered as a
feasible therapeutic agent in this situation. Intraocular
pressures, although they are reduced acutely, have not been shown
to be reduced following long-term treatment, nor has there been
any demonstration that visual function is preserved by the use of
cannabinoids in glaucoma. Some of the problems associated with
the development of cannabinoids as treatment for glaucoma have
already been cited (61). The exploitation of cannabinoids for
treatment of glaucoma will require much further developmental
work to ascertain which cannabinoid will be lastingly effective
and well tolerated. The potential benefits could be great, as
present-day glaucoma treatment still does not prevent blindness
as often as it might. If the effects of cannabinoids are additive
to those of other drugs, the overall benefit to patients may be
greater than is currently possible with single drugs. </p>

<h2>C. Analgesia</h2>

<p>Smoking of material estimated to deliver 12 mg of THC
increased sensitivity to an electric shock applied to the skin
(78). Single p.o. doses of 10 mg and 20 mg of THC were compared
with codeine (60 mg and 120 mg) in patients with cancer pain. A
20 mg dose of THC was comparable to both doses of codeine. The 10
mg dose, which was better tolerated, was less effective than
either dose of codeine (129). THC given i.v. in doses of 44 *g/kg
to patients undergoing dental extraction produced an analgesic
effect, which was less than that achieved from doses of 157 *g of
diazepam per kg i.v. Several of these patients actually preferred
placebo to the dose of 22 *g of THC per kg because of anxiety and
dysphoria from the latter drug (139). </p>

<p>The apparent paradox is that THC both increases and decreases
pain. </p>

<p>Traditionally, aspirin-like drugs, which work peripherally by
inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, are used to treat
pain derived from the integument. The initial mental stimulation
from THC might increase sensitivity to this kind of pain.
Visceral pain, such as that of cancer patients, is usually
treated by opiates, which have both peripheral and central sites
of action. Recent evidence suggests that opiates may act directly
on pain pathways in the spinal cord as well as reducing the
effect that produces pain. Cannabis could conceivably modify the
effective response. </p>

<p>Thus, when the two types of pain are distinguished from each
other, the apparent paradox is solved. </p>

<p>THC, nantradol, and nabilone shared some properties with
morphine in chronic spinal dog model. Latency of the skin twitch
reflex was increased, and withdrawal abstinence was suppressed.
Naltrexone did not antagonize these actions, suggesting that they
are not mediated through opiate receptors (56). </p>

<p>Levonantradol i.m. was compared with placebo in postoperative
pain, and a significant analgesic action was confirmed. No
dose-response relationship was observed, and the number of side
effects from levonantradol was rather high (89). It seems
unlikely that any THC homolog will prove to be analgesic of
choice, when one considers the present array of very effective
new analgesics of the agonist-antagonist type. It is too early to
be sure, however. </p>

<h2>D. Muscle Relaxant</h2>

<p>Patients with spinal cord injuries often self-treat their
muscle spasticity by smoking cannabis. cannabis seems to help
relieve the involuntary muscle spasms that can be so painful and
disabling in this condition. A muscle relaxant or antispastic
action of THC was confirmed by an experiment in which p.o. doses
of 5 or 10 mg of THC were compared with placebo in patients with
multiple sclerosis. The 10 mg dose of THC reduced spasticity by
clinical measurement (135). Such single small studies can only
point to the need for more study of this potential use of THC or
possibly some of its homologs. </p>

<p>Diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, baclofen, and dantrolene, which are
used as muscle relaxants, all have major limitations. A new
sleetal muscle relaxant would be most welcome. </p>

<h2>E. Anticonvulsant</h2>

<p>One of the first therapeutic uses suggested for cannabis was
as an anticonvulsant. Such an effect was documented
experimentally many years ago (112). Subsequent studies in
various animal species have validated this action. THC in cats
temporarily reduced the clinical and electrographic seizure
activity induced by electrical stimulation of subcortical
structures (175). Mice were protected by cannabidiol against
maximal electroshock seizures but not against those caused by
pentylenetetrazole. Its profile of activity more resembled that
of phenytoin than that of THC (170). THC and cannabidiol both
potentiated the anticonvulsant effects of phenytoin against
electrically induced seizures in mice. The two cannabinoids in
combination produced the most effect (29). Kindling involves the
once-daily application of initially subconvulsive electrical
stimulation to culminate in generalized convulsive seizures. THC
given chronically to rats prevented the kindling effect (174). </p>

<p>Clinical testing has been rare, despite all these various
lines of evidence supporting an anticonvulsant effect of
cannabinoids. Better control of seizures following regular
marijuana smoking was reported in a not very convincing single
case (39). Fifteen patients not adequately controlled by
anticonvulsants were treated with additional cannabidiol in doses
of 200 or 300 mg or placebo. Cannabidiol controlled seizures
somewhat better that the addition of placebo (25). Cannabidiol
has little if any psychoactivity, making it a good candidate for
this use. </p>

<h2>F. Bronchial Asthma</h2>

<p>A general study of the effects of marijuana on respiration
revealed a bronchodilating action in normal volunteer subjects.
Marijuana smoke was calculated to deliver 85 or 32 *g of THC per
kg. A fall of 38% in airway resistance and an increase of 44% in
airway conductance occurred in the high-dose group. The low-dose
group showed lesser changes, but they were still significant as
compared with baseline. The sensitivity of the respiratory center
to carbon dioxide was not altered by either dose, indicating no
central respiratory depression (172). </p>

<p>Asthma was deliberately induced by either inhalation of
methacholine or exercise in asthmatic patients. They were then
treated with inhalation of placebo marijuana, of saline, of
isoproterenol, or of smoke derived from marijuana containing 1 g
of THC. Both marijuana smoke and isoproterenol aerosol
effectively reversed both methacholine- and exercise-induced
asthma, while saline and placebo marijuana had no effect (160).
Aerosols of placebo-ethanol, of THC (200 *g) in ethanol, or of
salbutamol (100 *g) were tested in another study of ten stable
asthmatic patients. Forced expiratory volume in 1-s forced vital
capacity, and peak flow rate were measured on each occasion. Both
salbutamol and THC significantly improved ventilatory function.
Improvement was more rapid with salbutamol, but the two
treatments were equally effective at the end of 1 h (181). </p>

<p>Both delta-8 and delta-9-THC have bronchodilating effects,
while neither cannabinol nor cannabidiol has such actions. Thus,
this action resides only in the psychoactive material. No
evidence of tolerance to this effect developed over 20 days of
continual administration (58). The treatment of asthma is much
more chronic; further studies of tolerance will be needed. </p>

<p>Some patients might experience bronchoconstriction following
THC. Doses of 10 mg p.o. produced mild and inconsistent
bronchodilator effects as well as significant nervous system
effects. One patient of the six studied developed severe
bronchial constriction (1). Mild but significant functional
impairment, predominantly involving the large airways, was found
in 74 regular smokers of cannabis. Such impairment was not
detectable in individuals of the same age who regularly smoked
tobacco (64). </p>

<p>THC would be best administered by aerosol for this purpose,
but whether effective doses would avoid the mental effects is
uncertain. The mechanism of action by which THC increases airway
conductance may be different from the usual beta-adrenergic
stimulants. Resistance to repeated applications of
beta-adrenergic stimulants does occur. Another type of
bronchodilator might help some patients. The recent introduction
of highly effective steroid aerosols, such as beclomethasone,
meets that need to a considerable extent. </p>

<h2>G. Insomnia</h2>

<p>THC does not differ from conventional hypnotics in reducing
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (136). THC in doses ranging from
61 to 258 *g/kg produces in normal subjects increments in stage 4
sleep and decrements in REM sleep, but without the characteristic
REM rebound which follows chronic treatment with hypnotics. When
THC was administered p.o. as a solution in doses of 10, 20, and
30 mg, our subjects fell asleep faster after having mood
alterations consistent with a &quot;high.&quot; Some degree of
&quot;hangover&quot; the day following was noted from larger
doses (42). Another sleep laboratory study showed that a dose of
20 mg of THC given p.o. decreased REM sleep. After four to six
nights of use, abrupt discontinuation of THC produced mild
insomnia but not marked REM rebound (52). REM rebound may not be
apparent after low doses of THC. However, very high doses (70 to
210 mg) reduced REM sleep during treatment and were followed by
marked REM rebound after withdrawal (48). </p>

<p>The sleep produced by THC does not seem to differ much from
that of most currently used hypnotics. Side effects before sleep
induction as well as hangover effects make the drug less
acceptable than currently popular benzodiazepines. It seems
unlikely that THC will supplant existing hypnotics in treatment
of insomnia. </p>

<h2>H. Miscellaneous Uses</h2>

<h3>1. Hypertension. </h3>

<p>Orthostatic hypotension occasionally follows use of THC (5). A
dimethylheptyl side-chain derivative has more profound and
constant effects on blood pressure. In man, this compound showed
a marked orthostatic hypotensive effect, as well as tachycardia
and some mental symptoms resembling THC. While the latter are
less than from THC in proportion to the blood pressure-lowering
effect, a definite separation of pharmacological effects has not
been attained (106). </p>

<p>Effective antihypertensive drugs have been one of the
outstanding achievements of pharmacology over the past 30 years.
A new antihypertensive based on orthostatic hypotension, perhaps
the least desirable mode of lowering blood pressure, is hardly
very enticing (8). The issue seems hardly worth pursuing further.
<br>
</p>

<h3>2. Abstinence syndromes due to central nervous system
depressants. </h3>

<p>Synhexyl, the first THC homolog to be synthesized, was tested
as a treatment for withdrawal reactions from opiates and alcohol
with little evidence of efficacy. Withdrawal symptoms experienced
by rats following morphine pellet implantation, followed by
subsequent injection of naloxone, were reduced by THC.
Cannabidiol, without any direct effect itself, augmented the
action of THC (79). </p>

<p>This relatively weak effect of cannabinoids in opiate
dependence is unlikely to be of clinical use. Detoxification
programs using methadone have been highly successful and
acceptable. </p>

<h3>3. Antineoplastic activity</h3>

<p>Both the delta-8 and delta-9-THC isomers, as well as
cannabinol, have some antineoplastic effect on transplanted lung
tumors in animals, as well as on tumors in vitro (125). THC may
have a general ability to reduce the synthesis of nucleic acids,
which may account for reported immunosuppressant effects as well.
Many agents are available that inhibit nucleic acid synthesis, so
the possibility that THC or other cannabinoids might be
advantageous seems rather unlikely. </p>

<h3>4. Antimicrobial action</h3>

<p>Both THC and cannabidiol inhibit and kill staphylococci and
streptococci in vitro at concentrations of 1 to 5 *g/ml (173).
Such concentrations are well above those reported for use of THC
in man, even at the highest tolerated doses. Thus, this effect
seems to have little practical application. </p>

<h3>5. Migraine</h3>

<p>This indication has not been studied systematically in recent
years, although it has a long history. In one patient I treated,
the mental effects sought socially caused the patient to abandon
treatment. Innumerable successful treatments for migraine have
been reported at one time or another. </p>

<h3>6. Appetite stimulant</h3>

<p>Most antipsychotic agents will stimulate appetite, but few
other drugs do. </p>

<p>THC as compared with ethanol and dextroamphetamine produced a
variable response on appetite, both in fed and fasted subjects.
The majority had increased appetite and food consumption as
compared with placebo (80). </p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa might be helped by an appetite stimulant. A
test of the presumed appetite-stimulating properties of THC in
patients with anorexia nervosa failed over a 4-week period. Doses
of THC ranged between 7.5 and 30 mg/day and were compared with 30
mg of diazepam per day and placebo. Three of the 11 patients
treated with THC experienced severe dysphoria (65). </p>

<h3>7. Alcoholism.</h3>

<p>Cannabis users are said not to drink, but most do. The
prospect of changing an alcoholic into a cannabinolic has some
appeal. A study showed that cannabis was not very attractive to
alcoholics. Little difference in retention occurred among those
given no medication, or a cannabis cigarette, or disulfiram or
the combination of the cigarette and disulfiram (143). </p>

<h1>V. Summary</h1>

<p>Marijuana seems firmly established as another social drug in
Western countries, regardless of its current legal status.
Patterns of use vary widely. As with other social drugs, the
pattern of use is critical in determining adverse effects on
health. Perhaps the major area of concern about marijuana is
among the very young. Using any drug on a regular basis that
alters reality may be detrimental to the psychosocial maturation
of young persons. Chronic use of marijuana may stunt the
emotional growth of youngsters. Evidence for an amotivational
syndrome is largely based on clinical reports; whether marijuana
use is a cause or effect is uncertain. A marijuana psychosis,
long rumored, has been difficult to prove. No one doubts that
marijuana use may aggravate existing emotional disorders. Brain
damage has not been proved. Physical dependence is rarely
encountered in the usual patterns of social use, despite some
degree of tolerance that may develop. </p>

<p>The endocrine effects of the drug might be expected to delay
puberty in prepubertal boys, but actual instances have been rare.
As with any material that is smoked, chronic smoking of marijuana
will produce bronchitis; emphysema or lung cancer have not yet
been documented. Cardiovascular effects of the drug are harmful
to those with preexisting heart disease; fortunately the number
of users with such conditions is minimal. Fears that the drug
might accumulate in the body to the point of toxicity have been
groundless. </p>

<p>The potential deleterious effects of marijuana use on driving
ability seem to be self-evident; proof of such impairment has
been more difficult. The drug is probably harmful when taken
during pregnancy, but the risk is uncertain. </p>

<p>One would be prudent to avoid marijuana during pregnancy, just
as one would do with most other drugs not essential to life or
well-being. No clinical consequences have been noted from the
effects of the drug on immune response, chromosomes, or cell
metabolites. Contamination of marijuana by spraying with
defoliants has created the clearest danger to health; such
attempts to control production should be abandoned. </p>

<p>Therapeutic uses for marijuana, THC, or cannabinoid homologs
are being actively explored. Only the synthetic homolog,
nabilone, has been approved for use to control nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. </p>

<p>While little doubt remains that marijuana, THC, and nabilone
are effective for this use, the advent of other drugs that are
equally effective but with fewer adverse effects may make this
use moot. Use of marijuana to reduce intraocular pressure in
patients with glaucoma requires a feasible topical preparation of
cannabinoids. Although some cannabinoids have analgesic activity,
the abundance of new opioid analgesics with little dependence
liability provides tough competition. The use of marijuana as a
muscle relaxant, though promising, has not yet been adequately
studied. Clinical studies to establish the efficacy of
cannabidiol as an anticonvulsant or to compare it with other
anticonvulsants are still to be done. Other potential therapeutic
uses, such as treatment of bronchitis, asthma, insomnia,
hypertension, abstinence syndromes, migraine, anorexia, and
alcoholism, are most unlikely prospects. </p>

<p>Compared with other licit social drugs, such as alcohol,
tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not pose greater risks. One
would wonder, however, if society were given a choice based on
current knowledge, whether these drugs would have been granted
their present status of acceptance. Marijuana may prove to have
greater therapeutic potential than these other social drugs, but
many questions still need to be answered. </p>

<p>Few areas of scientific research have been as controversial as
the effect of marijuana on immune defenses. The effects of
marijuana on health in general have been marked by polarities of
belief or interpretation of evidence often due to the prejudices
of investigators. In addition, evidence of altered immune
functions is derived mainly from in vitro tests or ex vivo
experiments, which employed doses of cannabinoids far in excess
of those that prevail during social use of marijuana. Finally,
the clinical significance of the experimental observations is
difficult to assess. The present review will attempt to
objectively assess the evidence. Other recent reviews of the
subject have also appeared, with varying degrees of intensity of
coverage (Hollister 1986); Maykut 1985; Munson &amp; Fehr 1983;
Rosenkrantz 1976). For purposes of a more systematic discussion,
immunity will be considered as several separate topics: (1)
cell-mediated immunity, (2) humoral mechanisms, (3) cellular
defenses, and (4) immunogenicity of marijuana or cannabinoids. </p>

<p>CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY LYMPHOCYTE TRANSFORMATION Lymphocytes
exposed to several mitogens divide rapidly, increase protein and
nucleic acid synthesis, and show morphological changes resembling
blasts. This test of the ability of T-lymphocytes to transform
themselves measures one potential aspect of cell-mediated
immunity. A direct way to measure the activation of lymphocytes
is to measure the rate of incorporation of nucleic acid, such as
3H-thymidine, into the cells following addition of the mitogen to
the culture. All studies are conducted in vitro. </p>

<p>An early study (Nahas et al. 1976) measured 3H-thymidine
uptake in normal human lymphocytes stimulated by both
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and allogenic cell mixed lymphocyte
culture (MLC). The incorporation of 3H-thymidine was equally
inhibited by 10-5M to 10-4M concentrations of
D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), D8-tetrahydrocannabinol (D8-THC),
their corresponding 11-OH metabolites, a variety of other
inactive cannabinoids, and olivetol. THC in similar
concentrations also depressed 3H-uridine uptake, indicating an
effect of protein and RNA synthesis as well. These concentrations
were 10 to 20 times greater than those reported earlier by the
same group (Nahas et al. 1974) as having similar effects. In this
study, cell-mediated immunity was evaluated in 51 young, chronic
marijuana smokers whose lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro by
PHA and MLC. As compared with normal controls, 3H-thymidine
uptake was reduced. </p>

<p>Klein and colleagues (1985) added the predominantly T-cell
mitogens, PHA and concanavalin A (Con A), and the B-cell mitogen,
E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to mice spleen cells treated
with varying concentrations of THC and its active metabolite
11-OH-THC. Both T-cell lymphocyte and B-cell lymphocyte
proliferation in response to mitogens were suppressed by THC, but
considerably less by 11-OH-THC. Proliferation of both types of
lymphocytes was completely inhibited by concentrations of THC
(10ug/ml) that were not directly lytic to the cells. Lower
concentrations of THC were found to inhibit B-cell lymphocytes
than those required for T-lymphocytes, suggesting that humoral
immunity was more impaired than cell-mediated immunity in this
system. </p>

<p>By no means have all studies of cell-mediated immunity in
marijuana smokers or in vitro exposure of T-cells to
cannabinoids-often conducted in exactly the same way-shown
evidence of immunosuppression. Indeed, the inconsistency of study
findings has led to the present state of ambiguity. </p>

<p>White, Brin and Janicki (1975) obtained peripheral blood
lymphocytes from 12 healthy long-term marijuana smokers. The
blastogenic response to PHA and pokeweed mitogen were measured in
vitro by 3H-thymidine uptake. The responses of lymphocytes from
the marijuana smokers were not significantly different from those
who did not smoke the drug. </p>

<p>Lau and colleagues (1976) observed eight chronic smokers of
marijuana in a hospital setting over a 30-day period. Each
subject received a placebo during the first six days, followed by
THC in oral doses up to 210 mg/day for the next 18 days, then a
placebo for the last six days. The response of their lymphocytes
to PHA stimulation, as measured by 3H-thymidine uptake, was no
different in either of the three periods. </p>

<p>Rachelfsky and Opedz (1977) stimulated normal human
lymphocytes with PHA and with MLC, and 3H-thymidine uptake was
measured. The uptake of thymidine was unchanged in lymphocytes
exposed to 1.9 x 10-4M or 12.0 x 10-4M concentrations of THC.
Higher concentrations of THC precipitated in the medium. Changes
were comparable in cells exposed to THC and in those not so
exposed. </p>

<p>Kaklamani and colleagues (1978) obtained peripheral
lymphocytes from 12 chronic users of marijuana and 15 nonusing
control subjects. Lymphocytes from the experienced marijuana
users were obtained before and after smoking hashish.
Incorporation of 14C-thymidine, after PHA stimulation and
formation of rosettes of sheep erythrocytes, was no different
between the normal controls and the marijuana users either before
or after the latter had smoked hashish. </p>

<p>Whatever immunosuppressive effects marijuana may have, they
are not dependent on psychoactive components. A variety of
cannabinoids, which have no apparent central nervous system
activity, share an apparent immunosuppressive action (Smith et
al. 1978). </p>

<p>T-Lymphocyte Rosette Formation Another commonly used measure
of cell-mediated immunity is the ability of T-lymphocytes to form
in vitro rosettes of sheep erythrocytes surrounding T cells. A
dose-related decrease in rosette formation was found in
sensitized T cells exposed in vitro to various concentrations of
THC in this medium (Cushman, Khurana &amp; Hashim 1976). Cushman
and Khurana (1977) tested 10 subjects during a four-week cycle of
marijuana smoking, so that the subjects were exposed chronically
rather than acutely, and the results showed a decrease in early
T-cell formation, but no change in either late T-cell or B-cell
rosettes. When Gupta, Grieco and Cushman (1974) compared 23
chronic marijuana smokers with 23 nonsmokers, T-cell rosettes
were decreased in the users as compared with nonusers, but
associated with B-lymphocytes were not different, suggesting a
selective effect on cell-mediated immunity. </p>

<p>Petersen, Graham and Lemberger (1976) tested three subjects
who smoked &quot;street&quot; marijuana for rosette formation and
blastogenesis. Two of three showed decreased rosette formation
and impaired blastogenesis following stimulation of their
lymphocytes with PHA. In another trial, rosette formation was
measured in six persons three to six hours after they smoked a
marijuana cigarette containing 10mg of THC. Rosette formation was
impaired in five of the subjects, and became normal 24 hours
later in all but one subject. Thus, it appeared that the effects
of marijuana on T-lymphocytes are variable and reversible,
suggesting that factors other than exposure to marijuana itself
may be involved. </p>

<p>Mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes were treated with
intraperitoneal doses of 10, 25, and 40mg/kg/day of THC for seven
to eight days. Both plaque-forming and rosette-forming cells were
decreased by the 25mg/kg/day dose (Lefkowitz et al. 1978).
Monkeys were exposed to three levels of marijuana smoke over a
six-month period. Plasma immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) were
decreased in those monkeys exposed to medium and high
concentrations of smoke. In vitro tests by Dual and Heath (1975)
of the response of lymphocytes to Con A were decreased. Thus,
both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appeared to be affected.
However, the authors asserted that it is impossible to assess the
in vivo implications from tests of this sort. </p>

<p>Cushman and Khurana (1977) tested 10 subjects during a
four-week cycle of marijuana smoking, so that the subjects were
exposed chronically rather than acutely. the results showed a
decrease in early T-cell rosette formation, but no change in
either late T-cell or B-cell rosettes. </p>

<p>These studies also indicated that T-lymphocyte function, as
measured by rosette formation, was decreased when the cells are
exposed to cannabinoids either in vitro or ex vivo. However,
these impairments were rapidly reversible. </p>

<p>Other Measurements of Cell-mediated Immunity A number of other
measurements of cell-mediated immunity have pointed in the same
direction. Although both impaired allograft rejection and
decreased hemagglutinin titers were found in animals treated with
cannabinoids, the effect on allograft rejection as a measure of
cell-mediated immunity was greater (Munson et al 1976).
Susceptibility to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2
applied directly to the vagina was increased in mice that had
received doses of 100mg/kg/day of THC (Mishkin &amp; Cabral
1985). A similar increased susceptibility was found in guinea
pigs treated with doses of 4.0 and 10mg/kg/day (Cabral et al.
1986). </p>

<p>Morohan and colleagues assessed the LD50 dose of Listeria
monocytogenes in mice treated with THC in doses of 38, 75 and
150mg/kg. The LD50 was decreased 10-, 17- and 657-fold by each
dose, respectively. The marijuana extract was less active. A
similar challenge with herpes simplex type 2 virus showed a
96-fold decrease following administration of marijuana extract.
These situations are not at all comparable to human exposure. </p>

<p>The vast majority of people can be made sensitive to
dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), a powerful skin sensitizer. DNCB is
often used with &quot;recall&quot; antigens (eg. tuberculin and
mumps) to test patients for anergy. Sensitivity to DNCB was found
in all 34 chronic marijuana smokers who were tested as compared
with 96 percent of 279 healthy nonsmokers. On the other hand, 384
patients with cancer, whose cell-mediated immunity is sometimes
decreased, showed a positive reaction in only 70 percent of those
tested (Silverstein &amp; Lessin 1974). Such evidence raises
questions about the clinical significance of experiments that
have shown evidence of cell-mediated immunity from cannabinoids. </p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that the membrane-disordering effects
of THC may affect the binding of antigens to cellular receptors,
accounting for a decrease in cell-mediated immunity. On the other
hand, the combination of increased membrane disorder and
inhibition of acyltransferase activity in B cells and T cells
could impair the transfer of cellular constituents (Baczynsky
&amp; Zimmerman 1983b). Regardless of whether the action is a
nonspecific one at the cell membrane or at a more primary site,
impaired immunity remains precisely that. However, a cell
membrane site of action could explain the apparent transitory
nature of the observed alterations in cell-mediated immunity, as
well as the requirement for much larger concentrations of
cannabinoids than those usually encountered during social use of
marijuana </p>

<p>Summary of Effects of Cell-mediated Immunity In summary, the
effects of cannabinoids on cell-mediated immunity are
contradictory. Such evidence as has been obtained to support such
an effort has usually involved doses and concentrations that are
orders of magnitude greater than those obtained when marijuana is
used by human subjects. Clinically, one might assume that
sustained impairment of cell-mediated immunity might lead to an
increased prevalence of opportunistic infections, or an increased
prevalence of malignancy, as seen in the current epidemic of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). No such clinical
evidence has been discovered or has any direct epidemiological
data incriminated marijuana use with the acquisition of human
immunodeficiency virus infection or the clinical development of
AIDS. Even though some degree of impairment of immune responses
were to occur, the remaining immune function may be adequate,
especially in the young persons who are major users of cannabis. </p>

<p>HUMORAL IMMUNITY Transformation of B-Lymphocytes
Transformation of B cells stimulated by the mitogen PLPS was
inhibited more than were T cells stimulated by PHA following the
same doses of THC in mice (Klein et al. 1985). This evidence of
diminished B-cell reactivity following the administration of THC
was confirmed in another study (Munson et al. 1976) that showed a
dose dependent suppression from doses of 50, 100, and 200mg/kg of
THC in mice. These doses are enormous, of course. </p>

<p>Antibody Formation A frequently used measure of humoral
immunity is the ability of splenic lymphocytes from mice that are
immunized against sheep erythrocytes to form plaques when exposed
to in vitro to sheep erythrocytes. Levy and Heppner (1981) found
that both THC and haloperidol produced dose-dependent reductions
in hemolytic plaque-forming cell (PFC) numbers at the time of
peak reactivity (day 4) in control mice. Treatment with THC and
haloperidol only delayed the time of peak PFC formation by 24 to
48 hours (doses were high enough to produce signs of gross
behavioral toxicity). Neither THC nor other cannabinoids had any
effect on the titer of serum hemagglutinating antibody measured
seven days after immunization. </p>

<p>Baczynsky and Zimmerman (1983a) immunized mice with sheep
erythrocytes on Day 1 (primary immune response) and on Days 1 and
28 (secondary immune response) and measured hemagglutinin titers.
Mice treated with 10 mg or 15 mg of THC during the primary
immunization period exhibited a suppression of the primary
humoral immune response. These doses also suppressed the
secondary immune response, even when given during the period of
primary immunization. Mice treated with THC during the secondary
immunization period showed no measurable response. Other
cannabinoids had no effect. </p>

<p>Immature mice immunized with sheep erythrocytes also showed
suppression of the immune response when treated with THC in doses
of 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/kg. Splenic weight was reduced and PFC
as well as hemagglutinin titers were lower than controls. The
suppression was specific for THC and was not observed with
cannabidiol or cannabinol, even at doses of 25 mg/kg (Zimmerman
et al. 1977). Some evidence of tolerance or hyporesponsiveness to
this humoral antibody suppression by THC was found when mice were
treated with THC for five days prior to immunization as well as
afterward (Loveless, Harris &amp; Munson 1981-82). </p>

<p>Rosenkrantz, Miller and Esber (1975) immunized rats with a
single intraperitoneal dose of sheep erythrocytes during, before
and after administration of THC in order to determine its effect
on the inductive and productive phases of the primary immune
response. following a dose of 10 mg/kg, THC decreased the primary
immune response 33 to 40 percent; the inductive phase was
decreased by 48 to 78 percent by all doses of THC and the
productive phase was decreased by 26 to 59 percent by the higher
doses. </p>

<p>The same group (Luthra et al. 1980) tested the primary immune
response of rats to intraperitoneal administration of sheep
erythrocytes after five to 26 days following pretreatment with
THC in order to determine if tolerance developed to the
immunosuppressant effects. As measured by splenic
antibody-forming cells and hemagglutinin/hemolysin titers, no
evidence of tolerance was found. </p>

<p>Summary of Effects of Humoral Immunity In summary, humoral
immunity, as tested by a number of in vitro procedures, seems
also to be impaired by cannabinoids, but this effect was most
evident for THC. The clinical significance of such changes is
questionable due to the great concentrations of cannabinoids used
and the lack of any epidemiological evidence of increased
bacterial infections in chronic users of marijuana. </p>

<p>CELLULAR DEFENSES Leukocytes and Lymphocytes When 10 subjects
were followed through a four-week cycle of marijuana smoking, no
change was observed in either peripheral leukocyte or absolute
lymphocyte counts (Cushman &amp; Khurana 1977). Leukocytes from
five chronic marijuana smokers were compared with those from five
nonusers of the drug for their ability to migrate after exposure
to THC or marijuana extract. Both treatments inhibited leukocyte
migration without killing the cells, both in cells from users and
nonusers of marijuana. The prevailing THC concentration needed to
accomplish this was 2.0ug/ml, a couple of orders of magnitude
greater than any THC plasma concentrations usually found
clinically (Schwartzfarb, Needle &amp; Chavez-Chase 1974). </p>

<p>Natural Killer-cell Activity Natural killer-cell activity in
rats was decreased by subchronic treatment (25 days) with THC,
but not after acute treatment (one day). this effect was not
found in rats treated simultaneously with naloxone, suggesting
possible involvement with the opiate system (Patel et al 1985).
when injected into mice, both THC and its active metabolite
11-OH-THC suppressed splenic natural killer-cell activity in
vitro. The tissue concentrations of the cannabinoids were
reported as being 5.0-10.0 ug/ml, about two orders of magnitude
greater than those that might be experienced during the social
use of marijuana (Klein, Newton &amp; Friedman 1987). </p>

<p>Macrophages Macrophages work closely with T-cells as part of
the immunological defense system. On glass surfaces, macrophage
cultures normally show spreading, which is an indication of their
mobility. the addition of THC to the medium inhibited the degree
of spreading. It also inhibited the phagocytosis of yeast
particles (Lopez-Cepero et al 1986). However, another experiment
(Munson et al. 1976) using intact mice that were treated with a
single dose or multiple doses of THC could not demonstrate
impairment in reticuloendothelial activity, as measured by the
intravascular clearance of colloidal carbon. </p>

<p>Summary of Effects on cellular Defenses It is somewhat
surprising that newer techniques of cell sorting, which permit
determination of absolute counts of T- and B-lymphocytes as well
as subsets of T-lymphocytes, have not been utilized. the evidence
from the in vitro studies is weakened by the high concentrations
of drug that were used. Clinically, evidence for impairment of
cellular defenses has not been forthcoming. </p>

<p>IMMUNOGENICITY OF CANNABINOIDS Laboratory Studies It has been
hypothesized that THC, a relatively simple chemical, can act as a
hapten and become an immunogen. If such were the case, tolerance
to THC might be explained on an immunological basis as well as
the rare reports of allergic reactions. Azathioprine, an
immunosuppressant, had a modest effect in mitigating the
hypotensive effects of THC in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Spleen cells from mice treated with THC showed slightly more
blast transformation in culture than untreated spleen cells,
either with or without THC being added to the culture medium.
However, the degree of blast transformation was far less than
that produced by PHA. This somewhat weak evidence for an
immunogenic action of THC came from a laboratory that later
stressed the immunosuppressant effects of marijuana (Nahas,
Zugary &amp; Schwartz 1973). </p>

<p>Watson, Murphy &amp; Turner (1983) employed a technique used
to test compounds for their potential for producing allergic
contact dermatitis and that also maximizes the degree of skin
sensitization of guinea pigs. Sensitivity was greatly increased
by THC and cannabinol, but less so with other cannabinoids. </p>

<p>Clinical Studies In a clinical study conducted in the
southwestern United States (Freeman 1983), skin tests were
applied to 90 patients with various forms of atopy. The test was
positive for 63 patients for marijuana pollen as compared to only
18 who reacted to tobacco leaf. However, it is unlikely that
marijuana pollen contains many cannabinoids, but rather contains
proteins that many be sensitizing. </p>

<p>A series of 28 marijuana smokers showed precipitins for
Aspergillus antigens: 13 were positive as compared to one of 10
controls. Lymphocytes showed significant blastogenesis in three
of those subjects who tested positive. Seven of these 23 subjects
reported bronchospasm following the smoking of marijuana, and one
patient had evidence of systemic aspergillosis (Kagen et al.
1983). As it is well known that marijuana contains contaminants,
including molds and fungi, it is not surprising that these should
cause allergic reactions in some users. The study does not
indicate that cannabinoids themselves are immunogens. </p>

<p>Skin testing with cannabinoids seems to be useless for
determining the rare patient with sensitivity to marijuana. A
variety of intradermal tests with various cannabinoids and common
allergens was applied to 63 marijuana users by Lewis and Slavin
(1975). Two users, who were clearly atopic with a past history of
bronchial asthma, also reported experiencing asthma after some
exposures to marijuana. A third subject with a history of
allergic rhinitis also experienced similar symptoms following
marijuana use. All three of these subjects had negative skin
tests to cannabinoids. On the other hand, seven subjects who
tested positive for hemp and one who tested positive to D8-THC
had no clinical manifestation of marijuana sensitivity. </p>

<p>A 29-year-old woman (known to be allergic to ragweed)
experienced symptoms of ananaphylactoid reaction that lasted 20
to 30 minutes immediately after smoking marijuana. Skin tests
with THC showed a 2+ reaction, and with cannabidiol a 1+ reaction
(Liskow, Liss &amp; Parker 1971). The weakly positive skin tests
do not necessarily indicate that the reaction was due
specifically to cannabinoids. </p>

<p>Summary of Immunogenicity While it is possible that a few
persons may become truly allergic to cannabinoids, it is far more
likely that allergic reactions, which have been exceedingly rare
following the use of marijuana, are due to contaminants.
Marijuana is grown in the field and harvested along with
everything else (eg., bacteria, fungi, molds, parasites, worms,
chemicals) that may be found in such field plants. That such
impure material, when smoked and inhaled into the lungs, causes
so little trouble is really a marvel. </p>

<p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Despite the fairly large literature
that developed during the past 15 years or so, the effect of
cannabinoids on the immune system is still unsettled. The
evidence has been contradictory and is more supportive of some
degree of immunosuppression only when one considers in vitro
studies. These have been seriously flawed by the very high
concentrations of drug used to produce immunosuppression and by
the lack of comparisons with other membrane-active drugs. The
closer that experimental studies have been to actual clinical
situations, the less compelling has been the evidence. </p>

<p>Although the topic was of great interest during the 1970s, as
indicated by the preponderance of references from that period,
interest has waned during the present decade. This waning of
interest suggests that perhaps most investigators feel that this
line of inquiry will not be rewarding. the AIDS epidemic has also
diverted the attention of the immunologists to the far more
serious problem of the truly devastating effects a retrovirus can
have on a portion of the immune system. </p>

<p>The relationship between the use of social drugs and the
development of clinical manifestations of AIDS has been of some
interest, however. Persons infected with the virus but not
diagnosed as AIDS have been told to avoid the use of marijuana
and/or alcohol. This advice may be reasonable as a general health
measure, but direct evidence that heeding this warning will
prevent the ultimate damage to the immune system is totally
lacking. </p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>

<p>Most of the psychoactive drugs banned or severely restricted
by law in modern industrial societies have had significant
medical uses at some places and times. In the case of natural
plant drugs like opium, coca, cannabis, mescaline, and
psilocybin, this medical history usually reaches back thousands
of years and through a variety of cultures. The general tendency
has been to restrict the uses of these drugs as their dangers are
more strongly emphasized and substitutes become available.
Although the trend toward greater precision in the use of drugs
and greater concern for safety is a medical advance, there is a
danger that legal and social restrictions will prevent the
realization of some genuine medical potential. As we suggest in
this chapter, establishing the balance is a difficult process
that has not yet been worked out adequately. (The use of illicit
drugs also raises other issues, such as individual freedom of
choice, that are outside the scope of this essay.) </p>

<p>Different drugs are assigned to different social categories in
different cultures. The spectrum includes magic, religion,
medicine, recreation, disease, vice, crime, and madness. in
modern industrial societies, we put great emphasis on keeping
these categories separated, and that is one reason why
psychoactive drugs are so difficult for us to deal with. For
industrial societies, medicine or therapy is one thing, fun
another, religious ritual still another-an attitude reflected in
separate formal and informal institutions. The distinctions among
magic, religion, and medicine have not always been so clear as we
make them, or at least profess to make them. The words health and
holiness have a common root meaning &quot;whole.&quot; In
preindustrial societies medical diagnosis and prognosis have an
aura of the occult, something resembling divination, and disease
is usually considered an instrument of gods or evil spirits. </p>

<p>By the early nineteenth century, healers in Europe and in the
United States no longer attributed illness to spirits or
consciously identified the power of drugs as magical. The
scientific revolution had convinced physicians that most diseases
had physical and chemical causes, but a medical science created
in the image of physics remained only a hope. This uncertain
situation, together with the growth of manufacturing, capitalist
entrepreneurship, and the spirit of liberal individualism, made
the nineteenth century a great age of self-medication and
competing medical authorities. The patent medicine industry
therefore flowered in the late nineteenth century United States.
Many of the proprietary medicines contained psychoactive
drugs-alcohol, opium, cocaine, or cannabis. Orthodox physicians
used them extensively as well; as late as 1910, morphine was the
fourth most commonly used drug, and alcohol was the fifth. I
These drugs were not specific cures for specific diseases, and
little was known of their mechanism of action, but they provided
relief from suffering in varied situations. They were the classic
panaceas. Opium, alcohol, or cocaine, like faith in some
pharmacologically inactive proprietary nostrum, actually reduced
the pain while nature took its course, often toward a restoration
of health. </p>

<p>It was a familiar fact that psychoactive drugs, like most
strong medicine, could also be powerfully poisonous. Alternative,
often synthetic drugs, with less apparent abuse potential, were
developed in the late nineteenth century, and consciousness of
the dangers of the familiar natural drugs became more intense.
Problems were magnified by the isolation of drug substances in
pure form and the development of such technologies as the
hypodermic syringe. But the public and medical professionals also
began to mistrust psychoactive drugs because of their
indeterminate and apparently uncontrollable powers. Alcohol, for
example, lost its status as a medicine in the first two decades
of the twentieth century. </p>

<p>Psychoactive drugs had been used too freely in the nineteenth
century, and often the distinction between use for health and use
for pleasure was not carefully made. This ambiguity now began to
seem dangerous, just as the primitive ambiguity between health
and holiness had long been obsolete. Taking opium to relax or
cocaine to feel vigorous would no longer be regarded as a cure or
treatment. The common man's right to make choices about these
substances (even, for a time, alcohol) was repudiated. The
government and organized medicine took control over their
manufacture and distribution, carefully restricting their medical
uses and rejecting almost all other uses. This was part of the
process by which nineteenth century liberal capitalism
transformed itself into a more &quot;orderly&quot; state
corporate system; at the same time, the organized medical and
pharmaceutical professions and the larger drug companies
consolidated their power. In what is now known as the Progressive
Era, the Pure Food and Drug Act, the Harrison Narcotic Act, and
the Volstead Act were as much characteristic legislation as the
Federal Reserve Act. </p>

<p>The impulse to clean up society and reduce disorder was
hostile to free self-medication and chaotic small-scale
entrepreneurial competition. Professional hygiene required new
standards for medical and pharmaceutical practice, and
intellectual hygiene required clear and enforceable categories
for psychoactive drugs. Changes in medicine itself were also
important. Synthetic chemistry, experimental physiology, and
bacteriology advanced. The promise of a materialist medicine
based on the recognition of specific agents for specific diseases
seemed about to be fulfilled. Psychoactive drugs, with their
nonspecific and merely palliative effects, became more suspect. </p>

<p>The system established during the Progressive Era has
persisted until the present. As the medical and allied
professions expand, divide, and send out new branches, they
incorporate more and more social functions. This has sometimes
been called &quot;moral entrepreneurship&quot; or &quot;medical
imperialism.&quot; More recently, the right of medical
professionals to interpret the meaning of psychoactive drug use
has been challenged by scholars and social critics as well as
illicit drug users. In some cases they have advocated an openly
religious conception of psychoactive drug use, a recommendation
that we apply the standards of preindustrial cultures. The
practical merit of this idea may be dubious, but it does raise
two interesting issues: the dangers of technological advance and
the protective function of ritual. </p>

<p>Technical advances in science and manufacturing have increased
the danger of drug abuse by producing chemicals in pure form and
permitting their production on a vast scale. On the other hand,
these products of modern industry have powers commensurate with
their dangers: the face of Dr. Jekyll as well as Mr. Hyde. It
could be argued that in modern industrial societies the medical
profession has to provide the same kind of ritual or
quasi-religious context that makes drug use relatively safe in
primitive cultures. The priestly role of doctors in prescribing
occasions for drug use and warning against possession by the
demons in these drugs may sometimes seem arrogant, but it is
doubtful whether nineteenth century individualism or a return to
preindustrial cultural and technological forms would be better,
even if they were possible. </p>

<p>Physicians are now in a good position to examine rationally
how and when to use their authority in controlling psychoactive
drugs. They do not have to regard the complex powers of these
drugs as a challenge to their own domination of territory they
have legitimately staked out. Psychoactive drugs are still an
important part of the medical armamentarium, although most of
those in use today are synthetic. The doctrine of specific
etiology, based on infectious and dietary deficiency diseases, is
the source of modern medicine's great triumphs, and yet it
remains inadequate. For the vaguely defined functional problems
that still account for many visits to doctors, we often still
have no clear explanations and no better remedies than drugs that
affect the mind. This situation naturally causes much unease.
Doctors are accused by lay people and accuse one another of using
pills to resolve problems of living that demand more complex and
difficult adjustments. These fears are reasonable. On the other
hand, there remains a large area in which diseases and problems
of living overlap. What a doctor does in prescribing a
tranquilizer is not always different in a fundamental way from
what lay persons do in prescribing a beer or marijuana cigarette
for themselves. </p>

<p>Twentieth century societies have kept increasing government
control of therapeutic drugs on the ground that authoritative
knowledge about their efficacy and safety makes free individual
choice illusory. Psychoactive substances used as pleasure drugs
were the first to be restricted, but all prescription medicines
now have to go through an elaborate procedure of testing and
certification before they are approved for medical use. Of all
federal drug laws, only the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) was
designed to encourage free choice by consumers, because it was
aimed at simple fraud-false statements about the contents of the
package. Since the passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of
1938, the power to decide the availability of most drugs has
gradually been transferred, first from consumers to doctors and
then from doctors to the government. Before allowing a drug on
the market, the federal government must now judge whether it is
effective as well as whether it is safe. </p>

<p>Although most drugs are now illicit except when taken by
prescription, the common understanding of the term &quot;illicit
drugs&quot; includes only psychoactive drugs used for pleasure,
most of which are covered by the federal criminal provisions of
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and similar state laws. It
would be impossible to discuss all of them here. Some are among
the most commonly used drugs and have a variety of medical
applications-notably the benzodiazepine tranquilizers, the
barbiturates, and the synthetic and natural opioids. We will
concentrate here on four classes of drugs that have much more
limited medical acceptability. All four are placed in the two
most restricted schedules under the Controlled Substances Act.
Cocaine and amphetamines have currently accepted medical uses;
marijuana and psychedelic drugs do not. We will explore the past
and present, potential and actual, experimental and established,

<p><b>COCA AND COCAINE</b> </p>

<p>Cocaine is an alkaloid extracted from the leaves of the shrub
Erythroxylon coca, which has long been cultivated in Bolivia and
Peru as a stimulant and for medicinal purposes. For thousands of
years, inhabitants of the Peruvian and Bolivian highlands and the
western Amazon region have been mixing coca leaves with ash or
lime, putting the wad in a cheek, and letting the juice trickle
into their stomachs. In many parts of the Amazon and the Andes
today, coca is the everyday stimulant drug, used more or less as
coffee, tea, chewing tobacco, and khat are used in other areas of
the world. </p>

<p>In one study of a mountain village in Peru, coca was found to
be the standard remedy for symptoms of hunger and cold and for
two folk illnesses: el soka, a condition of weakness, fatigue,
and general malaise; and el fiero, a chronic wasting illness.
Coca was also the treatment of choice for stomach upset and
stomachache and for colic, or severe gastrointestinal distress
including diarrhea, cramps, and nausea. 2 </p>

<p>In the form of leaf powder or tea, coca is taken for
toothache, ulcers, rheumatism, asthma, and even malaria. Coca tea
is often served to tourists arriving in hotels and inns in the
high Andes as a remedy for the nausea, dizziness, and headache of
soroche (altitude sickness). Unlike other stimulants, coca is
also a local anesthetic. The juice of the leaf can be applied to
soothe eye irritations or gargled for hoarseness and sore throat.
Coca leaves are also used as a topical anesthetic for mouth
sores. Coca contains minerals, vitamin C, and some B vitamins,
and it is sometimes said to be an important source of these
nutrients in the Andean diet. </p>

<p>An American physician, Andrew Weil, has recently been trying
to revive interest in the therapeutic uses of coca, which he
believes have been neglected because of the medical profession's
fascination and subsequent disillusionment with the pure alkaloid
cocaine. He has found coca useful in the symptomatic relief of
indigestion, gastritis, constipation, motion sickness,
laryngitis, and other ailments. He believes that it could serve
as a substitute for coffee in persons who find that their
stomachs are upset by that stimulant. He also proposes its use as
an appetite-reducing drug and as an energizer for physical labor,
and he suggests that it might serve as a relatively safe
substitute in treating amphetamine and cocaine dependence. He
points out that coca differs from cocaine in several ways. It
contains a number of related alkaloids rather than a single one,
and it is less subject to abuse because it enters the body by the
normal gastrointestinal route rather than intranasally,
intravenously, or through the lungs. He believes that coca might
best be administered in the form of a chewing gum. </p>

<p>Ever since the Spanish conquest there has been controversy
about the health effects of habitual coca use. The evidence is
unreliable, contradictory, and heavily colored by the political
and social biases of observers. A number of studies have
suggested that coca chewers are apathetic, subnormal in
intelligence, or subject to various physical illnesses because
they are weakened by the drug.' But even these results are
ambiguous and inconclusive.' The biggest problem is separating
cause from effect. If coca users in the high Andes seem
undernourished, demoralized, and unhealthy, that is easily
explained by the miserable physical and social conditions under
which many of them live-conditions for which coca use apparently
gives them some relief. It is significant that many Indians in
the Amazon who use coca are reported to be strong and healthy.'
In any case, the people of the Andes themselves, including those
who do not use coca, usually reject the suggestion that it is a
drug problem, a threat to health, or a danger to their community.
</p>

<p>Cocaine was isolated from the coca leaf in 1860. Throughout
the late nineteenth century, both coca itself (that is, an
extract from the leaf including all of its alkaloids) and the
pure chemical cocaine were popular as medicines in Europe and
North America. In 1863 Angelo Mariani, a Corsican chemist,
patented a preparation of coca extract and wine, which he called
Vin Mariani; it became one of the most popular prescription
medicines of the era, and was used by such celebrities as Thomas
Edison, Ulysses Grant, Henrik Ibsen, Pope Leo XIII, Emile Zola,
Jules Verne, and the Prince of Wales. Mariani wrote several
articles and monographs on coca in which he combined historical,
botanical, and medical information with the promotion of his
company's product; he could list thousands of physicians who
recommended it.' </p>

<p>By 1878 coca was being promoted in advertisements in the
United States for young persons suffering from shyness and as a
stimulant. In the same year, an American physician, W. H.
Bentley, began to recommend coca as a cure for morphine
addiction. Extract of coca was admitted to the United States
Pharmacopoeia in 1882. In July 1884, Sigmund Freud published a
famous paper, &quot;On Coca,&quot; in which he recommended
cocaine or coca extract for a variety of illnesses including the
syndrome of fatigue, nervousness, and minor physical complaints
then known as neurasthenia.' Referring to Freud's writings, the
Parke-Davis Company declared in its pamphlet &quot;Coca
Erythroxylon and Its Derivatives&quot;: &quot;If these claims are
substantiated . . . [cocaine] will indeed be the most important
therapeutic discovery of the age, the benefit of which to
humanity will be incalculable.&quot;' </p>

<p>This article and later articles by Freud were influential, but
the rediscovery of cocaine's local anesthetic properties by his
colleague Karl Koller proved to be of more permanent importance.
Koller introduced topical cocaine in eye operations, and soon
cocaine was being used in many other forms of surgery. William
Halsted of Johns Hopkins University invented nerve block or
conduction anesthesia by injecting cocaine into nerve trunks.
Soon regional anesthesia and spinal anesthesia were introduced.
It was not until the early twentieth century that synthetic local
anesthetics without the stimulant properties of cocaine were
developed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, cocaine was triumphing as what would now be
disparagingly called a panacea. It was recommended for exhaustive
and irritative conditions of the central nervous system,
seasickness, trigeminal neuralgia, hay fever, head colds, and
what was then called &quot;catarrh.&quot; In 1901 the American
physician W. Golden Mortimer published an encyclopedic volume,
History of Coca, in which he recommended coca wine, coca extract,
or cocaine for a great variety of purposes. In an appendix he
cited the responses to a letter he had sent to &quot;a selected
set&quot; of more than 5,000 physicians asking for their
observations on coca. Of the 1,206 replying, 369 said that they
had used coca in their own practices. They commonly observed that
it increased appetite, raised blood pressure, stimulated
circulation, strengthened the heart, improved digestion,
stimulated the mind, and worked as an aphrodisiac. The most
popular therapeutic uses were for exhaustion, overwork, and
neurasthenia. Few thought there was a dangerous tendency to form
a coca habit.10 </p>

<p>One of the most popular drinks containing cocaine was
CocaCola, first concocted in 1886 by a Georgia pharmacist. The
Coca-Cola Company was founded in 1892, and throughout the 1890s
CocaCola was advertised as a headache remedy and stimulant as
well as an enjoyable drink. In 1903 coca extract was removed from
Coca-Cola and replaced with caffeine. A de-cocainized extract of
the coca leaf is still used for flavoring. </p>

<p>In the medical use of coca and cocaine, it is hard to separate
the central stimulant from the digestive, respiratory, and local
anesthetic effects. A singer or actor who drank Mariani's wine
could hardly know how much of the improvement he or she noticed
was caused by local anesthesia or constriction of blood vessels
in the throat and how much by euphoria and a feeling of mastery.
As for stomach and intestinal problems, the gastrointestinal
system is probably the most common site of psychosomatic
symptoms. The use of coca or cocaine in convalescence from
long-lasting debilitating diseases represents a similar
combination of central and peripheral effects. </p>

<p>Abuse and dependence became problems almost as soon as cocaine
was introduced into medicine. Cocaine dependence first appeared
in morphine addicts who took the cocaine cure recommended by
Bentley and Freud. Halsted, the inventor of nerve block
anesthesia, appears to have cured himself of a craving for
cocaine by taking up morphine and paying the price of physical
addiction. In his last paper on cocaine, published in 1887, Freud
admitted that the cocaine habit could be more dangerous to health
than morphine addiction.&quot; Later in life he seldom referred
to cocaine. </p>

<p>The growing fear of cocaine changed attitudes toward coca.
Advocates of coca then began to fight a rear-guard action in its
defense, insisting that coca never caused the kinds of problems
that were ruining the reputation of cocaine, and even saying that
the effects of coca might be caused primarily by other chemicals
in the leaf. But by 1900 public and medical opinion had begun to
turn against both coca and cocaine. In 1906 the Pure Food and
Drug Act banned food and drinks containing cocaine, and further
legal restrictions soon followed, culminating in the Harrison Act
of 1914, which regulated cocaine as well as opiates. Cocaine and
the coca leaf were still prescribed occasionally through the
1920s for many of the same purposes as in the late nineteenth
century, although criminal laws and other restraints made it less
easily available. But its use gradually declined until, by 1930,
it was rarely being used except as a surgical anesthetic and an
illicit pleasure drug. </p>

<p>Today cocaine is used in medicine mainly as a topical
anesthetic in eye, ear, nose, and throat surgery and fiber tube
optical examinations of the upper respiratory and digestive
tracts. It has a combination of properties that cannot be
duplicated by any of the synthetic local anesthetics: intense
constriction of blood vessels (important whenever bleeding must
be prevented), long duration of anesthesia (one hour), and low
toxicity. Cocaine is no longer used in infiltration anesthesia
(subcutaneous injection), in nerve block anesthesia, or in spinal
anesthesia. 12 Recently topical application of cocaine to the
upper palate has been recommended as a way of aborting the severe
pain of cluster headaches. 13 </p>

<p>Other medical uses are rare. Cocaine is an ingredient in
Brompton's mixture, a preparation used in Great Britain for
treating the chronic pain of terminal cancer, but controlled
studies at a hospice in England have suggested that the cocaine
in this drink provides no advantage over morphine alone.&quot;
Cocaine was never tested seriously as a treatment for severe
depression, but this idea is unlikely to be revived because the
pharmacologically similar amphetamines have proved a failure for
that purpose. Today substitutes have been found for most
therapeutic uses of cocaine, and in most cases its dangers are
believed to outweigh its potential benefits. Despite the recent
and so far uncertain signs of reviving interest, coca and cocaine
will never again be so widely used in medicine as they once were.
</p>

<p>Legally, the coca leaf and all its derivatives containing
cocaine are classified under the Controlled Substances Act as
Schedule 11 drugs: This means that there is a currently accepted
medical use but also a high potential for abuse and dependence.
Schedule 11 drugs may be prescribed under special restrictions;
hospitals and pharmacies are required to keep them in a locked
place. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>AMPHETAMINES </b></p>

<p>Amphetamines and amphetamine congeners are a large group of
chemically related central stimulant drugs; among the best known
are dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), methamphetamine (Methedrine)
and methylphenidate (Ritalin). Racemic amphetamine sulfate
(Benzedrine) was first synthesized in 1887, but it was not
introduced as a medicine until 1932, when the Benzedrine inhaler
became available over the counter in drugstores as a treatment
for nasal congestion and asthma. In late 1937 the new drug was
introduced in tablet form to treat narcolepsy and
postencephalitic parkinsonism. It was also recommended for
depression and to heighten energy and capacity for work. Soon
amphetamine was receiving sensational publicity with numerous
references to &quot;brain,&quot; &quot; pep,&quot; and
&quot;superman&quot; pills. Even when phrased as warnings, these
reports served mainly to arouse curiosity. </p>

<p>But amphetamine use spread mainly because the medical
profession was so enthusiastic about the drugs. Many doctors
regarded amphetamines as remedies with extraordinary scope,
efficacy, and safety. By 1943 more than half the sales of
Benzedrine went to fill prescriptions written for people who
wanted to lose weight, obtain a temporary lift in spirits, or
stay awake for extended periods. In 1946 W. R. Bett asserted that
amphetamine had thirty-nine clinical uses, including treatment
for epilepsy, postencephalitic parkinsonism, schizophrenia,
alcoholism, behavior problems in children, migraine, muscular
rigidity and spasm, head injuries, dysmenorrhea, and
hypotension.15 </p>

<p>Although not all these uses were generally adopted, by 1971
the total production of amphetamines had reached the equivalent
of more than 10 billion 5 mg tablets. Until 1971, amphetamines
were sold freely over the counter without prescription in the
form of inhalers such as the Dristan inhaler. They were also easy
to obtain in the form of pills, capsules, or injectable liquids,
with or without a visit to the doctor for a prescription. The
Army used amphetamines heavily during the Vietnam War, and
amphetamine abuse became a problem among the troops. 16 From the
mid-1960s on there was also a growth in both illicit bathroom
laboratory synthesis of amphetamines and black market diversion
of legitimately produced drugs. </p>

<p>Since 1970 use and abuse of amphetamines have declined because
of legal restrictions and a better understanding of their
dangers, which include weight loss, psychosis, severe dependence,
and depression on withdrawal. It is as though the career of
amphetamines from 1940 to 1970 recapitulated the career of
cocaine in the late nineteenth century. Not having learned from
history, we were condemned to repeat it. Although chemically
different from cocaine, the amphetamines have similar stimulant
effects and similar liabilities. After the first flush of
enthusiasm, the range of accepted medical uses for amphetamines
narrowed, just as it had for cocaine a generation earlier. The
only present widely accepted medical uses for amphetamines are in
treating narcolepsy and attention deficit disorder. They are
occasionally used as an adjunct to tricyclic antidepressants in
the treatment of depression. They are also still prescribed for
weight loss, but this practice is becoming less and less common
because of wellfounded doubts about their safety and
effectiveness. </p>

<p>The amphetamines used in medicine are placed in Schedule 11
under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 as later amended.
Like cocaine, they are regarded as drugs having a currently
accepted medical use but a high potential for abuse, which may
lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. An applicant
to manufacture such drugs must register with the attorney
general. The attorney general establishes production quotas, and
there are special restrictions on prescriptions. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Weight Loss</b> </p>

<p>Until the early 1970s, amphetamines were overwhelmingly the
drug of choice in treating overweight by appetite reduction.
Their anorectic effect is apparently secondary to the stimulating
effect. Controlled studies have found that amphetamines increase
weight loss, at least in the first few months, by making it easy
to adhere to a diet. But the user rapidly grows tolerant to the
anorectic effect, and it can rarely be sustained more than a few
months without an increase in the dose. 17 It also appears that
most patients, once they stop using amphetamines or become
tolerant to them, go back to their former eating habits and
regain the weight they have lost. </p>

<p>The favorable results of clinical studies on the appetite
reducing effects of amphetamines must also be balanced by a
consideration of adverse effects, including the danger of abuse.
Even if the intention is to expose the patient to amphetamine
only for a short period, compulsive eaters who have a need for
constant gratification may find it hard to put aside a medication
that makes them feel good. They may also discover, when they no
longer have the magic potion that protects them from themselves,
that a psychological vacuum has developed that needs to be filled
with food. </p>

<p>Appetite is governed by physiology, habit, and emotional
state. Tension and depression, inability to delay gratification,
and the substitution of food for other forms of pleasure, all of
which are common in cases of overweight, increase the danger of
drug dependency. A drug that reduces appetite without requiring
any solution to emotional problems may seem to be a reasonable
alternative at first, but the short-term weight loss may cause
patients to avoid the issue of changing their eating and exercise
habits. (The same problem, of course, often occurs when drugs are
administered for other emotional problems and habitual behavior.)
</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether amphetamines should be used for weight
reduction under any circumstances. All anorectic drugs, and
especially amphetamines, have a limited value in the treatment of
obesity; because of their potential for dependence and abuse,
they should be used with extreme care, if at all. The
prescription of amphetamines for weight loss has properly
declined in the last decade. </p>

<p><b>Narcolepsy</b> </p>

<p>Narcolepsy, first described ninety years ago, is a disorder
marked by an uncontrollable desire for sleep or sudden attacks of
sleep during the daytime. It usually begins in adolescence, and
it never completely remits. Narcolepsy is considered rare, but it
is not clear just how common it is, and in any case, it is a
complicated problem. It may involve either REM (dreaming) sleep
or non-REM sleep, and it may be complicated by cataplexy (loss of
muscle tone), sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations.
Tricyclic antidepressants are used to treat these symptoms, but
they do not eliminate the sleep attacks themselves. There is no
evidence of brain pathology in narcolepsy, but heredity may be a
factor. </p>

<p>Amphetamine was first introduced as a treatment for narcolepsy
in 1935, and one or another amphetamine congener continues to be
the drug treatment of choice. Dextroamphetamine or
methylphenidate may be necessary for a narcoleptic person whose
work is dangerous, but most victims of narcolepsy can perform
satisfactorily without drugs if they take at least one nap a day.
The risk of dependence, toxic reactions, and psychosis must be
weighed against the advantages of drug-induced wakefulness. </p>

<p><b>Depression</b> </p>

<p>Depression is probably the most common complaint of adults.
Its symptoms are both physical and emotional: loss of appetite
and energy, insomnia, fatigue, difficulty in concentration,
feelings of worthlessness and self-reproach, thoughts of death
and suicide, anxiety and irritability. Amphetamines were one of
the first classes of drugs to be used in the treatment of
depression, beginning in 1936. Early studies sometimes led to
excessive enthusiasm, because they were not controlled and the
clinical symptoms of depression show a strong tendency to
spontaneous remission. Even in the early stages, amphetamines
were generally found to be ineffective in severe depressions and
in treating the depressed phase of bipolar (manicdepressive)
illness. Early studies of less serious depressions demonstrated
some effectiveness but raised questions about possible dangers.
Even at that time researchers mentioned the possibility of
increasing the risk of suicide by heightening energy and
mobility. Suicide attempts may also occur during the severe
depression that sometimes follows withdrawal. Nevertheless, as
late as 1958, C. D. Leake strongly recommended amphetamines for
depression in an authoritative book. 18 </p>

<p>As the dangers of insomnia and anxiety became more apparent,
interest developed in using amphetamines together with sedatives
such as the barbiturate sodium amytal. Each drug, it was thought,
would counteract the unfortunate side effects of the other.
Although doubt soon developed about the effectiveness of these
combinations, they were marketed for years under various trade
names and soon became sources of a new kind of drug abuse. </p>

<p>By the 1950s, new amphetamine congeners with fewer side
effects, such as methylphenidate, had been developed, but they
proved to be no more effective in treating depression. Eventually
two new groups of drugs, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
and the tricyclics, revolutionized the field. Tricyclic
derivatives, along with lithium for manic-depressive illness, are
now believed to be the most effective drug treatment for
depression. Controlled studies comparing tricyclic
antidepressants to amphetamines or placebo have found
amphetamines ineffective in the treatment of all types of
depression.&quot; But amphetamine-related stimulants may
potentiate the effects of the tricyclics by slowing their
metabolism in the body; and they may also evoke an immediate
response that encourages the depressed patient to keep taking a
tricyclic whose effects do not become apparent for a few weeks.20
</p>

<p>A few other uses for amphetamines in the treatment of
depression are still occasionally recommended. Methylphenidate
has been proposed to treat depression in patients who are
medically ill or recovering from surgery and therefore unable to
tolerate the side effects of tricyclic antidepressants. This is
especially true of heart patients and elderly people with organic
brain disease.&quot; Amphetamines taken intravenously in
combination with morphine have also been recommended in the
treatment of postoperative pain.&quot; in some studies
amphetamines seem to be effective in obsessive-compulsive
disorder, but other drugs are available for this purpose as
well.&quot; </p>

<p>Drugs should not be used as a substitute for reassurance and
exploration of the patient's concerns in cases of mild
depression, fatigue, or anxiety. If amphetamines are used to
relieve symptoms that are often indistinguishable from the
tensions of everyday life, they may make the patient feel good
but they will only mask the underlying problem. A patient
complaining of fatigue, nervousness, anxiety, or insomnia may be
asking for a kind of short-term psychotherapy from a person
believed to be trustworthy. When a doctor responds with a
stimulant pill, he or she may be depriving the patient of a
service that should be provided and may perpetuate a pattern of
drug use as a substitute for coping with the problems of daily
life. Fortunately, most physicians have come to recognize this,
and amphetamines are no longer commonly used in treating
depression. </p>

<p><b>Attention Deficit Disorder</b> </p>

<p>The most controversial remaining medical use of amphetamines
is the treatment of the syndrome known variously as
hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, minimal brain dysfunction, and, most
recently, attention deficit disorder. It is probably the most
common behavioral disorder of childhood; boys are affected five
to ten times as often as girls. The main symptoms are extreme
physical restlessness (hyperactive children move more, even in
sleep) and short attention span; other symptoms are poor
coordination, intolerance for frustration, aggressive and
impulsive behavior, and learning disabilities. The problem
usually begins in infancy, but it becomes especially troublesome
in the classroom. Hyperactive children do not usually outgrow
their problems, although the symptoms may change. In adolescence
they are often academic underachievers with poor social skills
and low self-esteem, who may become juvenile delinquents. Many of
the symptoms also persist in adult life. </p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder overlaps in its symptoms with
disorderly behavior and more serious developmental disorders of
childhood. Symptoms found in hyperactive children are also found
in some children with known brain injuries and are often
associated with neurological signs of central nervous system
malfunction. The term &quot; minimal brain dysfunction&quot;
suggests an organic cause, but so far no specifically
characteristic neurological disorder or brain pathology has been
found. The current term &quot;attention deficit disorder&quot;
suggests that the problem reflects the way activity is organized
in response to social demands as much as it involves physical
motion. Hyperactivity is probably a mixture of symptoms with
different origins in different children; in many cases a genetic
factor may be involved. </p>

<p>The use of amphetamines in treating hyperactive children began
in 1937, when Charles Bradley observed that it produced striking
effects on a number of schoolchildren showing various kinds of
disturbance. Their problems, aside from hyperactive behavior,
included specific learning disabilities, aggressiveness
associated with epilepsy, and schizoid withdrawal. The drug
reduced their motor activity and impulsive behavior, improved
their attention, diminished mood swings, increased their interest
in the surroundings, made them less anxious and irritable, and
improved their school achievement. 24 Studies on the amphetamine
treatment of disturbed children with a variety of diagnoses
reported a substantial improvement in behavior and school
performance as judged by parents, teachers, and caregivers .25 </p>

<p>There is still much confusion about what symptoms respond to
amphetamines. Some studies suggest that children who show signs
of a neurological disorder do better on amphetamines than other
restless children who do not show such signs. Others find that
amphetamines contribute to relieving the symptoms of disturbed
children in general, whether or not there is evidence of a
learning disorder or brain injury.26 The apparent calming effect
of these stimulant drugs on hyperactivity in children has been
called paradoxical, with the implication that the effect is
specifically related to the disorder. But it turns out that
single doses of amphetamine affect normal boys the same way they
affect hyperkinetic boys-increasing attention span and reducing
motor activity.27 </p>

<p>Amphetamines have serious limitations and dangers. The results
of treatment are more variable and less spectacular than they may
appear. Amphetamines probably do not help hyperkinetic preschool
children or improve specific learning disorders such as reading
problems .28 The symptoms usually return when the drug is
withdrawn, and in any case its benefits seem to occur mainly in
the first few months; long-term treatment does not lead to a
better outcome.29 Attention problems, impulsiveness, and academic
failure persist in adolescence among children diagnosed as
hyperactive whether or not they have taken amphetamines. </p>

<p>Some hyperactive children even get worse on amphetamines; in
one study, 16 percent of the children showed an exaggeration of
the original symptoms.&quot; A few serious adverse reactions have
also been reported, including an amphetamine psychosis and
movement disorders.&quot; Even children who are benefited by
amphetamines may suffer from loss of appetite, dizziness, pallor,
and digestive troubles. These symptoms usually diminish or
disappear after the first week, and they can usually be minimized
by adjusting the dose. (Methylphenidate has fewer toxic
side-effects than do other forms of amphetamine.) A more serious
problem is that some amphetaminetreated hyperactive children fail
to achieve expected gains in weight and height. The effect is
statistically significant but generally not large. It might be
neutralized by the spurt in growth that begins in adolescence;
the evidence is not yet available. In any case, the growth of
children taking stimulant drugs must be carefully
monitored.&quot; </p>

<p>For educational psychologists who found that many disturbed
children did not respond to psychotherapy and for educators
interested in the relationship between learning disabilities and
behavior problems, amphetamines have suggested new approaches to
treatment. But children should not be given drugs as soon as they
become restless or unruly. Often the problem lies in the school
or home as much as in the child. Children need an educational
environment that will help them come to grips with their problems
without using pharmacological shortcuts unless they are
absolutely necessary. Teachers, parents, and physicians should
try other methods before resorting to amphetamines. Physicians
must be certain that their diagnoses are accurate. At one time
amphetamines may have been used excessively in treating
hyperactivity because of imprecise diagnosis and overzealous
promotion by drug companies and educators, but it is our
impression that physicians and educators now have a better
understanding of the limitations as well as the advantages of
amphetamines and are using them with more care. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS</b> </p>

<p>The psychedelics or hallucinogens are a large group of drugs,
some natural and some synthetic, with a variety of chemical
structures. The best known are mescaline, derived from the peyote
cactus; psilocybin, found in over a hundred species of mushrooms;
and the synthetic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which is
chemically related to certain alkaloids found in morning glory
seeds, the lysergic acid amides. This class of drugs also
includes the natural substances harmine, harmaline, ibogaine, and
dimethyltryptamine (DMT), as well as a large number of synthetic
drugs that are chemically described as tryptamines or
methoxylated amphetamines. A few of these are diethyltryptarnine
(DET), 3,4,-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and
2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM, also known as STP). </p>

<p>The natural hallucinogens have long been used by preindustrial
cultures, especially in Mexico and South America, for magical,
religious, and healing purposes, and today the peyote cactus is
the sacrament of the Native American Church, a religious
organization with branches in all western states of the United
States. Peyote became known in industrial society toward the end
of the nineteenth century, and many other plant hallucinogens
have been discovered since. LSD was first synthesized in 1938 and
its psychoactive properties were discovered in 1943; since then
many other synthetic psychedelic drugs have been developed in
laboratories. </p>

<p>The psychedelic drugs differ somewhat in their subjective
effects and greatly in the effective dosage. LSD is the most
potent and produces the widest range of effects; it can be taken
as a prototype. Although the response to LSD varies with
personality, expectations, and setting, it almost always produces
profound changes in perception, mood, and thinking. Perceptions
become unusually brilliant and intense; normally unnoticed
details capture the attention and ordinary things are seen with
wonder. Synesthesia, changes in body image, and alterations in
time and space perception are common. Vivid dreamlike imagery
appears before closed eyes. True hallucinations are rare, but
visual distortions and pseudohallucinations are common. Emotions
become unusually intense and may change abruptly and often.
Suggestibility is greatly heightened. The experience is suffused
by a heightened sense of reality and significance, and it often
produces feelings of religious and philosophical insight. The
sense of self is greatly changed, sometimes to the point of
merging with the external world, separation from the body, or
dissolution in mystical ecstasy. </p>

<p>The most common adverse effect of LSD and related drugs is the
&quot;bad trip,&quot; which occasionally produces a true
psychotic reaction. </p>

<p>Another common effect is the flashback, a spontaneous
transitory recapitulation of drug-induced experience in a
drug-free state. Prolonged adverse reactions, which are
considerably less common, include anxiety reactions, depressive
reactions, and psychoses. They are most likely to occur in
schizoid and prepsychotic personalities with barely stable egos
who cannot cope with the mind alterations produced by the drug
trip. There is a close resemblance between people hospitalized
for LSD reactions and those hospitalized for psychoses not
produced by drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>A persistent issue has been possible genetic damage and birth
defects. The available evidence suggests that LSD produces no
chromosome damage in reproductive cells of a kind that is likely
to cause birth defects; the same is true of other psychedelic
drugs to the extent that they have been tested. There is also no
evidence that LSD is teratogenic in human users at normal doses. </p>

<p>Ever since experimentation with psychedelic drugs began, some
users and psychotherapists have maintained that a single
psychedelic experience or several such experiences can provide
religious insight, heightened creative capacity, psychological
insight, or relief from neurotic symptoms. From 1950 to the
mid-1960s, psychedelic drugs especially LSD, mescaline, and
psilocybin-were used extensively in experimental psychiatry. The
drugs were studied as a chemical model for natural psychoses and
also used extensively in psychotherapy. More than a thousand
clinical papers were published discussing forty thousand
patients; there were several dozen books and six international
conferences on psychedelic drug therapy. It was recommended at
one time or another for a wide variety of problems, including
alcoholism, obsessional neurosis, and childhood autism. Beginning
in the mid-1960s, with the increase of illicit use, it became
difficult to obtain the drugs or get funding for research, and
professional interest declined. There is now only one legally
approved project in the United States involving the therapeutic
use of psychedelic drugs; it is located at the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Institute in Baltimore. Maybe those two
decades of psychedelic research will eventually be written off as
a mistake that has only historical interest, but it might be
wiser to see if something can be salvaged from them. </p>

<p>One source of the therapeutic interest was the belief of some
experimental subjects after taking a psychedelic drug that they
were less depressed, anxious, and guilty, and more
self-accepting, tolerant, or sensually alert. Interest also arose
from the possibility of making therapeutic use of the powerful
psychedelic experiences of regression, abreaction, intense
transference, and symbolic drama to improve the results of
psychodynamic psychotherapy. Two kinds of therapy emerged, one
making use of the mystical or conversion experience and the other
exploring the unconscious in the manner of psychoanalysis.
Psychedelic therapy, as the first kind was called, involved the
use of a large dose (200 micrograms of LSD or more) in a single
session; it was thought to be potentially helpful in reforming
alcoholics and criminals as well as improving the lives of normal
people. The second type, psycholytic (literally, mind-loosening)
therapy, required relatively small doses and several or even many
sessions; it was used mainly for neurotic and psychosomatic
disorders. In practice, many combinations, variations, and
special applications with some of the features of both
psycholytic and psychedelic therapy evolved. </p>

<p><b>Neurotic Disorders</b> </p>

<p>In a book about her LSD treatment, one woman described the
result this way: </p>

<p>I found that in addition to being, consciously, a loving
mother and a respectable citizen, I was also, unconsciously, a
murderess, a pervert, a cannibal, a sadist, and a masochist. In
the wake of these dreadful discoveries, I lost my fear of
dentists, the clicking in my neck and throat, the arm tensions,
and my dislike of clocks ticking in the bedroom. I also achieved
transcendent sexual fulfillment.... </p>

<p>At the end of nine sessions over a period of nine weeks I was
cured of my hitherto incurable frigidity, and at the end of five
months I felt that I had been completely reconstituted as a human
being. I have continued to feel that way ever since.&quot; </p>

<p>These passages were written three years after a five-month
period during which this woman took LSD twenty-three times.
Before that she had had four years of psychoanalysis, but it was
only after LSD that she became convinced of the value of Freud's
theories. </p>

<p>The literature contains a number of such impressive case
histories, but these anecdotal accounts can always be questioned;
placebo effects, spontaneous recovery, special and prolonged
devotion by the therapist, and the therapist's and patient's
biases in judging improvement must be considered. The most
serious deficiencies in psychedelic drug studies were absence of
controls and inadequate follow-up. And psychedelic drug effects
are so striking that it is difficult to design a double-blind
study, in which neither the person administering the drug nor the
person taking it knows whether it is the active substance or a
placebo. No form of psychotherapy for neurotics has ever been
able to justify itself under stringent controls, and LSD therapy
is no exception. </p>

<p>Furthermore, psychiatrists did not agree about details. Should
the emphasis be on expression of repressed feelings or on working
through a transference attachment to the psychiatrist? How much
therapy is necessary in the intervals between LSD treatments?
Because of the complexity of psychedelic drug effects, there are
no general answers to these questions. It appeared that LSD
treatment sometimes produced spectacular improvement in neurotic
symptoms, but no reliable formula for success was derived from
these results. But again, in these respects psychedelic drug
therapy seems to be in no better or worse position than most
other forms of psychotherapy. </p>

<p><b>Alcoholism</b> </p>

<p>Psychedelic therapy for alcoholism is based on the assumption
that one overwhelming experience sometimes changes the
self-destructive drinking habits of a lifetime, and the hope that
psychedelic drugs can consistently produce such an experience. In
one reported case, a 40-year-old black, unskilled laborer was
brought to a hospital from jail after drinking uncontrollably for
ten days. He had been an alcoholic for four years, and he was
also severely anxious and depressed. He described his experiences
during an LSD session as follows: </p>

<p>I was afraid. I started to run, but something said &quot;Stop!
Stop!&quot; then I felt as if ten tons had fallen from my
shoulders. I prayed to the Lord. Everything looked better all
around me.... I changed my mind from alcohol toward Christ and
the rose came back into my life.... As I sat up and looked in the
mirror I could feel myself growing stronger. I feel now that my
family and I are closer than ever before and I hope that our
faith will grow forever and ever. </p>

<p>One week later his score on a questionnaire testing neurotic
traits had dropped from the 88th to the 10th percentile. Six
months later his psychological tests were within normal limits;
he had been totally abstinent from alcohol for all that time and
despite a temporary relapse when he lost his job, he was still
sober after twelve months .36 LSD undoubtedly produces powerful
effects on alcoholics; the question is whether they can be
reliably translated into enduring change. Early studies reported
dazzling success. About 50 percent of severe chronic alcoholics
treated with a single high dose of LSD were said to be recovered
and sober a year or two later. 37 But the early studies proved to
be inadequate. When the patients were randomly assigned to drug
and control groups it proved difficult to demonstrate any
advantage for LSD treatment, even in studies conducted by
advocates of the drug .38 The problem is that many alcoholics
will improve, at least temporarily, after any treatment because
excessive drinking is often sporadic and periodic relapses are
common. The alcoholic who arrives at a clinic or hospital is
probably at a low point in the cycle and has nowhere to go but
up. </p>

<p>It would be wrong to conclude that a psychedelic experience
can never be a turning point in the life of an alcoholic. As
William James said, &quot;Religiomania is the best cure for
dipsomania.&quot; Unfortunately, psychedelic experiences have the
same limitations as religious conversions. Their authenticity and
emotional power are not guarantees against backsliding when the
old frustrations, constraints, and emotional distress have to be
faced in everyday life. Even when the revelation does seem to
have lasting effects, it might have been merely a symptom of
readiness to change rather than a cause of change. </p>

<p>The fact remains that there is no proven treatment for
alcoholism. </p>

<p>Where so little is known, it may not make sense to give up
entirely on anything that has possibilities. In the religious
ceremonies of the Native American Church, periodic use of high
doses of mescaline in the form of peyote is regarded as, among
other things, part of a treatment for alcoholism. Both the
Indians themselves and outside researchers believe that those who
participate in the peyote ritual are more likely to abstain from
alcohol. Peyote sustains the ritual and religious principles of
the community of believers, and these sometimes confirm and
support an individual commitment to give up alcohol. Even federal
alcoholism clinics for Indians now recognize that peyote might
have some value.&quot; If, for whatever reasons, psychedelic
drugs work for at least some Indians some of the time, they might
also help some non-Indian alcoholics. </p>

<p><b>Dying</b> </p>

<p>There is a new consciousness today of the significance of
dying as part of life. As we look for ways to change the pattern,
so common in chronic illness, of constantly increasing pain,
anxiety, and depression, the emphasis is shifted away from
impersonal prolongation of physical existence toward a conception
of dying as a psychiatric crisis, or even, in older language, a
religious crisis. The purpose of giving psychedelic drugs to the
dying might be stated as reconciliation: reconciliation with
one's past, one's family, and one's human limitations. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1965, the experiment of providing a psychedelic
experience for the dying was pursued at Spring Grove State
Hospital in Maryland and later at the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Institute. Walter Pahnke, the director of the project
from 1967 until 1971, was a Doctor of Divinity as well as a
psychiatrist, and he first reported on his work in an article in
the Harvard Theological Review in 1969. When terminal cancer
patients received LSD or DPT after appropriate preparations,
about one-third were said to have improved
&quot;dramatically,&quot; one-third improved
&quot;moderately,&quot; and one-third were unchanged; the tests
of improvement were reduced tension, depression, pain, and fear
of death.&quot; Later experiments with </p>

<p>terminal cancer patients produced similar results.&quot; There
were no control groups in these studies, and there is no certain
way to separate the effects of the drug from those of the special
therapeutic arrangements and increased attention that were part
of the treatment. Nevertheless, the case histories are
impressive, and it would be interesting to renew the research;
the present work at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Institute
is an attempt to do that. </p>

<p><b>Complications and Dangers</b> </p>

<p>Like any probing psychotherapy, psychedelic drug therapy
presents the danger that unconscious material will come up and be
neither accepted and integrated nor totally repressed; in that
case, symptoms will become worse. Psychosis and even suicide have
been reported in the course of psychedelic drug treatment. On the
other hand, some people who have worked with psychedelic drugs
consider them more likely to prevent suicide than to cause it,
and most studies questioning psychiatrists about adverse
reactions to psychedelic drugs in experimental or therapeutic
research have revealed a low rate of serious complications .42 </p>

<p>All such studies have limitations. Some psychiatrists may have
minimized the dangers out of therapeutic enthusiasm or reluctance
to admit mistakes; some may have exaggerated the dangers under
the influence of bad publicity; long-term risks may have been
underestimated if follow-up was inadequate. The studies provide
no basis for comparison with patients who were not treated with
psychedelic drugs or not treated at all. But the fact remains
that psychedelic drugs were used for more than fifteen years by
hundreds of psychiatrists who considered them reasonably safe as
therapeutic agents. </p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>When a new kind of therapy is introduced, especially a new
psychoactive drug, events often follow a pattern of spectacular
success and enormous enthusiasm followed by disillusionment. But
the rise and decline of psychedelic drug therapy took a somewhat
unusual course. From the early 1960s on, the revolutionary
proclamations and religious fervor of the nonmedical advocates of
psychedelic drugs began to evoke hostile incredulity rather than
simply the natural skeptical response to extravagant claims
backed mainly by intense subjective experiences. Twenty years
after their introduction, psychedelics were pariah drugs, scorned
by the medical establishment and banned by the law. In rejecting
the absurd notion that these drugs were a panacea, we have chosen
to treat them as entirely worthless and extraordinarily
dangerous. Maybe the time has come to find an intermediate
position. If the therapeutic results have been erratic and
inconsistent, that is partly because of the complexity of
psychedelic drug effects. For the same reason, we may simply not
yet have had enough time to sort out the best uses of these
drugs. </p>

<p>An informal kind of research continues anyway. Illicit
psychedelic drug use is an underground spring that continues to
feed the stream of interest in systematic, publicly controlled
experimentation. Ironically, the illicit drug use that was one of
the reasons for the interruption of legitimate research now
serves to keep alive efforts aimed at resuming that research.
Interest also persists among some psychologists and
psychiatrists. We quote a letter written in 1979 by Hanscarl
Leuner of the University of Gottingen: </p>

<p>Though in several European countries therapists in this field
could apply for licenses to continue using the drugs, the
government authorities over the years started to make things
difficult.... I myself was convinced that science does not depend
on ideologies. This seems to be an error. The continuation of
psycholytic therapy during the last years led us to new
techniques and conceptions. The results in practical therapy are
even more convincing than before. We would like not to stop doing
psycholytic therapy. Optimistically, I hope that in time we can
publish these results. For so many patients there is a tremendous
need for deep probing and intensity in psychotherapy which
psycholytic and related therapies could fill.&quot; </p>

<p>There are now dozens of known psychedelic drugs, some of them
synthesized only in the last twenty years. Few have been tested
seriously in human beings. Their effects are sometimes different
from those of LSD and other familiar substances. These
differences may be significant for the study of the human mind
and for psychotherapy, but we cannot analyze them properly
without more controlled human research. A Chilean psychiatrist,
Claudio Naranjo, has pioneered in the use of psychedelic drugs
that do not produce the same degree of perceptual and emotional
change as does LSD. He has worked especially with MDA and a
related shorter-acting amphetamine, MMDA, which give a heightened
capacity for introspection and intimacy along with a temporary
freedom from anxiety and depression.44 These and related drugs
might be useful in marital counseling, in diagnostic interviews,
and in helping patients decide whether they want to go through
the process of psychotherapy. 45 </p>

<p>It is a misunderstanding to regard psychedelic drug therapy as
a form of chemotherapy, like giving lithium to manic patients.
Patients are not maintained for a long time on psychedelic drugs,
and these drugs do not produce dependence or addiction. On the
other hand, the claims of psychedelic drug therapy are subject to
the same doubts as those of psychoanalysis or religious
conversions. The mixture of mystical and transcendental claims
with therapeutic ones is an aspect of psychedelic drug therapy
troubling to our culture. The pronouncements of drug enthusiasts
are sometimes too much like religious testimonials to please
either psychiatrists or priests and ministers. Preindustrial
cultures seem to tolerate more ambiguity in this matter, and
there is now a growing interest in the ideas and techniques
shared by primitive shamans, Eastern spiritual teachers, and
modern psychiatrists. The word &quot;cure,&quot; after all, means
both treatment for disease and the care of souls. </p>

<p>The role of the guide on a psychedelic drug trip, which has
both religious and medical aspects, is spontaneously reproduced
in all cultures where psychedelic drugs come to be used. Much of
the controversy about psychedelic drugs in the 1960s was in
effect concerned with the question of who was qualified to be a
guide. For the moment we have made the curious decision that no
one in modern industrial society is qualified for this position.
Nevertheless, psychedelic drug therapy apparently still goes on
underground, in one form or another. Many have regarded it as an
experience worth having, some as a first step toward change, and
a few as a turning point in their lives. They might be deceiving
themselves, but we do not know enough to be certain; the field
has potentialities that are not being allowed to reveal
themselves. </p>

<p><b>A Note on Legal Status</b> </p>

<p>The publicly familiar psychedelic drugs are classified in
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act; they are regarded as
having a high potential for abuse, no current medical use, and a
lack of safety for use under medical supervision. They are
available for medical experimentation as investigational drugs,
but present research is confined almost entirely to animals. A
number of psychedelic drugs that were recently synthesized or
that have never been available in any quantity on the illicit
market are not scheduled. It is legal for physicians to work
clinically with these substances, although experimental research
in human beings is not permissible until animal tests have been
done. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>CANNABIS</b> </p>

<p>Marijuana is derived from the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).
Its most important psychoactive chemical,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-l-tetrahydrocannabinol in
another nomenclature), is contained in a resin that covers the
flower clusters and top leaves of the plant; the resin also
contains many chemically related substances with lesser effects.
Cannabis preparations vary widely in quality and potency
depending on the type of plant, climate, soil, and methods of
cultivation and manufacture. The resin can be ingested in the
form of a drink or in foods, but usually the leaves and flowering
tops are smoked, either in a pipe or in a cigarette called a
joint. </p>

<p><b>History</b> </p>

<p>Like cocaine and other psychoactive drugs derived from natural
plant sources, marijuana has been used for thousands of years as
a medicine as well as an intoxicant. It was listed in an herbal
published by a Chinese emperor that may go back to 2800 B.C. In
Jamaica, where it was introduced in the seventeenth century by
African slaves, it has become the most popular folk medicine.
Cannabis in the form of an alcoholic tincture was commonly used
in nineteenth-century Europe and the United States as an
anticonvulsant, sedative, and analgesic, and also in tetanus,
neuralgia, uterine hemorrhage, rheumatism, and other conditions.
It was thought to be a milder but less dangerous sedative than
opium, and it was also considered an appetite stimulant. Between
1839 and 1900 more than a hundred articles appeared in scientific
journals on the therapeutic uses of marijuana. After the
introduction of injectable opiates in the 1850s and synthetic
analgesics and hypnotics in the early twentieth century, the
medical use of cannabis declined. But even as late as 1937,
extract of cannabis was still a legitimate medicine marketed by
drug companies. The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 imposed a
registration tax and record keeping requirements that made
medical use of cannabis so cumbersome that it was dropped from
the U.S. Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary. </p>

<p>The Marijuana Tax Act was introduced under the influence of a
growing concern about the use of marijuana as an intoxicant,
especially among blacks and Mexican-Americans in the South and
Southwest. The law passed after a strong campaign by the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics, despite a lack of empirical evidence on the
harmfulness of marijuana. The legislative counsel for the
American Medical Association at the time objected to the law,
saying that future investigations might show substantial medical
uses for cannabis. But the American Medical Association soon
changed its stance and for the next thirty years maintained a
position on marijuana very similar to that of the Federal Bureau
of Narcotics. Recent years have seen some relaxation of legal
restrictions and increasing clarification of the medical
potential of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, but considerable
obstacles remain and considerable research still has to be done. </p>

<p><b>Safety</b> </p>

<p>The greatest advantage of cannabis as a medicine is its
unusual safety. The ratio of lethal dose to effective dose is
estimated on the basis of extrapolation from animal data to be
about 20,000 to one. Huge doses have been given to dogs without
causing death, and there is no reliable evidence of death caused
by cannabis in a human being. Cannabis also has the advantage of
not disturbing any physiological functions or damaging any body
organs when it is used in therapeutic doses. It produces little
physical dependence or tolerance; there has never been any
evidence that medical use of cannabis has led to habitual use as
an intoxicant. </p>

<p>Whole cannabis preparations have the disadvantages of
instability, varying strength, and insolubility in water, which
makes it difficult for the drug to enter the bloodstream from the
digestive tract. Another problem is that marijuana contains so
many ingredients with possible disadvantageous effects, including
too high a degree of intoxication. This multitude of ingredients
is also an opportunity, since it suggests the manufacture of
different cannabinoids, synthetic or natural, with properties
useful for particular purposes; some of these have now become
available.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Depression and Pain Relief</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis and synthetic cannabis derivatives have been tested
as treatments for depression, so far without good evidence of
effectiveness .47 It might be possible to develop synthetic
cannabis preparations with a higher euphoriant-to-sedative ratio
than the drugs that have been tested so far. </p>

<p>There are many anecdotal reports of marijuana smokers using
the drug to reduce pain: postsurgery pain, headache, migraine,
menstrual cramps, and so on. The disadvantage is its inconsistent
effect; sometimes it actually heightens sensitivity to pain. It
is possible that cannabis acts by mechanisms different from those
of other analgesics, but the literature does not indicate a
specific effect of cannabis on pain pathways or suggest that it
is likely to be more effective than other analgesics. Again, some
new synthetic derivative might prove useful as an analgesic, but
this is not an immediate prospect. </p>

<p><b>Alcohol Dependence</b> </p>

<p>Because of reports that some people use less alcohol when they
smoke marijuana, cannabis has been proposed as an adjunct to
alcoholism treatment. But so far it has not been found useful .48
Most alcoholics neither want to substitute marijuana nor find it
particularly useful. But there might be some hope for use of
marijuana in combination with disulfiram (Antabuse), which
protects alcoholics by producing uncomfortable symptoms when they
drink.&quot; Certainly a cannabis habit would be preferable to an
alcohol habit for anyone who could not avoid dependence on a drug
but was able to substitute one drug for another. </p>

<p><b>Spasticity and Seizures</b> </p>

<p>About 20 percent of epileptics do not get much relief from
conventional anticonvulsant medications. Cannabis has been
explored as an alternative, at least since a case was reported in
which marijuana smoking, together with the standard
anticonvulsants phenobarbital and diphenylhydantoin, was
apparently necessary to control seizures in a young epileptic
man.50 Marijuana also reduces muscle spasm and tremors in some
people who suffer from cerebral palsy or multiple
sclerosis.&quot; But the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(hereafter called THC itself are inconsistent; it can actually
heighten susceptibility to some types of seizures. The cannabis
derivative that is most promising as an anticonvulsant is
cannabidiol. In one controlled study, cannabidiol in addition to
prescribed anticonvulsants produced improvement in seven patients
with grand mal seizures; three showed great improvement. Of eight
patients who received a placebo instead, only one improved. 52 </p>

<p><b>Asthma</b> </p>

<p>Asthma is a breathing disorder that arises when bronchial
muscles go into spasm and the pathway to the lungs is blocked by
mucus and swelling. A number of antiasthmatic drugs are
available, but they all have drawbacks-limited effectiveness or
side effects. Because marijuana dilates the bronchi and reverses
bronchial spasm, cannabis derivatives have been tested as
antiasthmatic drugs. Smoking marijuana would probably not be a
good way to treat asthma because of chronic irritation of the
bronchial tract by tars and other substances in marijuana smoke,
so recent research has sought a better means of administration.
THC in the form of an aerosol spray has been investigated
extensively.&quot; Other cannabinoids such as cannabinol and
cannabidiol may be preferable to THC for this purpose. An
interesting finding for future research is that cannabinoids may
affect the bronchi by a different mechanism from that of the
familiar antiasthmatic drugs. </p>

<p><b>Glaucoma</b> </p>

<p>A promising new medical use for cannabis is in treating
glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness in the United
States. In this disease, fluid pressure within the eyeball
increases until it damages the optic nerve. About a million
Americans suffer from the form of glaucoma (wide angle) treatable
with cannabis. Marijuana causes a dose-related, clinically
significant drop in intraocular pressure that lasts several hours
in both normal subjects and those with the abnormally high ocular
tension produced by glaucoma. Oral or intravenous THC has the
same effect, which seems to be specific to cannabis derivatives
rather than simply a result of sedation. Cannabis does not cure
the disease, but it can retard the progressive loss of sight when
conventional medication fails and surgery is too dangerous. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether topical use of THC or a
synthetic cannabinoid in the form of eyedrops will be preferable
to smoking marijuana for this purpose. So far THC eyedrops have
not proved effective, and in 1981 the National Eye Institute
announced that it would no longer approve human research using
these eyedrops.55 Studies continue on certain synthetic cannabis
derivatives and other natural cannabinoids. Smoking marijuana is
a better way of titrating the dose than taking an oral
cannabinoid, and most patients seem to prefer it. Unfortunately,
many patients, especially elderly ones, dislike the psychoactive
effects of marijuana. </p>

<p><b>Cancer Treatment</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis derivatives have several minor or speculative uses in
the treatment of cancer, and one major use. As appetite
stimulants, marijuana and THC may help to slow weight loss in
cancer patients.&quot; THC has also retarded the growth of tumor
cells in some animal studies, but results are inconclusive, and
another cannabis derivative, cannabadiol, seems to increase tumor
growth.&quot; Possibly cannabinoids in combination with other
drugs will turn out to have some use in preventing tumor growth. </p>

<p>But the most promising use of cannabis in cancer treatment is
the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing
chemotherapy. About half of patients treated with anticancer
drugs suffer from severe nausea and vomiting. In about 30 percent
to 40 percent of these, the commonly used antiemetics do not
work.&quot; The nausea and vomiting are not only unpleasant but a
threat to the effectiveness of the therapy. Retching can cause
tears of the esophagus and rib fractures, prevent adequate
nutrition, and lead to fluid loss. </p>

<p>The antiemetics most commonly used in chemotherapy are
phenothiazines like prochlorperazine (Compazine). The suggestion
that cannabis might be useful arose in the early 1970s when some
young patients receiving cancer chemotherapy found that marijuana
smoking, which was of course illegal, reduced their nausea and
vomiting. In some studies, oral THC has proved effective where
the standard drugs were not.59 In other studies the two types of
drugs seemed to be equally effective.60 In one study nabilone, a
synthetic cannabinoid, was found more effective than a
phenothiazine.61 But nabilone tests have been discontinued
because of animal deaths and adverse reactions in human beings. </p>

<p>It is generally agreed that THC is a good antiemetic, but as
in the case of glaucoma, many patients reject it because they
find the psychoactive effects unpleasant. There is some
controversy about whether THC is best taken orally or smoked in
the form of marijuana. Marijuana is related to THC in much the
same way that coca is related to cocaine; it contains a variety
of chemicals instead of one and enters the body by a different
route. Smoking generates quicker and more predictable results in
both glaucoma and cancer treatment, because it raises THC
concentration in the blood more easily to the needed level. Also,
it may be hard for a nauseated patient in chemotherapy to take
oral medicine. But many patients dislike smoking or cannot
inhale. </p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>

<p>A committee of the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences remarked in a report in 1982: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Cannabis shows promise in some of these areas, although
    the dose necessary to produce the desired effect is often
    close to one that produces an unacceptable frequency of toxic
    [undesirable] side effects. What is perhaps more encouraging
    ... is that cannabis seems to exert its beneficial effects
    through mechanisms that differ from those of other available
    drugs. This raises the possibility that some patients who
    would not be helped by conventional therapies could be
    treated with cannabis.... It may be possible to reduce side
    effects by synthesizing related molecules that could have a
    more favorable ratio of desired to undesired actions; this
    line of investigation should have a high priority. 62 </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="last">The committee recommended further research,
especially in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in
chemotherapy, asthma, glaucoma, and seizures and spasticity.</a> </p>

<p>Under federal and most state statutes, marijuana is listed as
a Schedule I drug: high potential for abuse, no currently
accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety for use under
medical supervision. It cannot ordinarily be prescribed and may
be used only under research conditions. </p>

<p>But public pressure has begun to change the situation. Several
individuals have successfully argued the rare defense of medical
necessity in response to criminal charges of marijuana
possession; in one case glaucoma was involved and in another
multiple sclerosis. Now the National Cancer Institute, the Drug
Enforcement Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration have
agreed to a program whereby the National Cancer Institute is
making THC available through the pharmacies of about five hundred
teaching hospitals and cancer centers to physicians who want to
use it for chemotherapy. The legislatures of twenty-three states
have also authorized special research programs that supply
cannabis for the management of nausea and vomiting in
chemotherapy. In effect these programs provide means for the
seriously ill to gain legal access to marijuana. Physicians
acting on their own can apply for permission to use marijuana,
but the regulations are so complicated that physicians who want
help for one or two patients may advise them to get the marijuana
on the streets instead. State programs, in effect, assume
responsibility for completing the paperwork required by the
federal government and relieve the physician of this burden. The
states make use of confiscated marijuana or marijuana cigarettes
or THC pills supplied by the federal government. </p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration does not approve of efforts
to publicize therapies that have not gone through the standard
legal process of new drug testing. Advocates of medical marijuana
use want to circumvent not only the Controlled Substances Act but
also the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 and its amendments
that establish procedures for testing and marketing new drugs.
The FDA says that marijuana will never be an approved medicine
because it contains so many chemicals and its composition is so
variable. The requirement of a -standardized dose alone may
prevent the marketing of marijuana in the ordinary way as
medicine. This obstacle does not stand in the way of THC in pill
form. A special form of THC in a gelatin capsule with sesame seed
oil has recently been transferred to Schedule II under the
Controlled Substances Act, and hearings are being held to
determine whether THC in other forms should also be placed in
Schedule II. </p>

<p>The potential of cannabis as a medicine is yet to be realized,
partly because of its reputation as an intoxicant, ignorance on
the part of the medical establishment, and legal difficulties
involved in doing the research. Recreational use of cannabis has
affected the opinions of physicians about its medical potential
in various ways. When marijuana was regarded as the drug of
blacks, Mexican-Americans, and bohemians, doctors were ready to
go along with the Bureau of Narcotics, ignore its medical uses,
and urge prohibition. For years the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) and other groups have been
petitioning the government to change this classification.
Although that has not happened, cannabis derivatives have become
more available for medical purposes through various devices. Now
that marijuana has become so popular among a broad section of the
population, we have been more willing to investigate its
therapeutic value. Recreational use now spurs medical interest
instead of medical hostility. </p>

<p>The struggle over medical marijuana use illustrates some of
the issues discussed earlier: self-medication versus government
control, pure chemicals versus natural drugs, the historical
direction of drug policy and the present minor challenges to it,
the need to find a better balance in making rules about drugs.
The potential dangers of marijuana when taken for pleasure and
its possible usefulness as a medicine are historically and
practically interrelated issues: historically, because the
arguments used to justify public and official disapproval of
recreational use have had a strong influence on opinions about
its medical potential; practically, because the more evidence
accumulates that marijuana is relatively safe even when used as
an intoxicant, the clearer it becomes that the medical
requirement of safety is satisfied. Most recent research is
tentative, and initial enthusiasm for drugs is often disappointed
after further investigation. But it is not as though cannabis
were an entirely new agent with unknown properties. Studies done
during the past ten years have confirmed a centuries-old promise.
With the relaxation of restrictions on research and the further
chemical manipulation of cannabis derivatives, this promise will
eventually be realized. The weight of past and contemporary
evidence will probably prove cannabis to be valuable in several
ways as a medicine. </p>

<p>latest </p>

<p>Plaintiff, </p>

<p>vs. </p>

<p>STATE OF WASHINGTON, </p>

<p>Defendant. </p>

<p>________________________________ </p>

<p>No. 94-2-11862-1 </p>

<p>PLAINTIFF'S REPLY BRIEF </p>

<p>SUPPORTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT </p>

<p>IN FAVOR OF PLAINTIFF </p>

<p>HEARING DATE: OCTOBER 6, 1995 </p>

<p>I. INTRODUCTION </p>

<p>The characterization of this plaintiff as bringing &quot;the
latest in a series of fruitless attempts to legalize marijuana
and bypass the legislature's exercise of its broad
discretion&quot; (defendant's brief, page 7 line 24) is an
egregious insult which trivializes the experiences of this lawyer
which led to this lawsuit. </p>

<p>DECLARATION OF RALPH SEELEY </p>

<p>I am Ralph Seeley, a lawyer and the pro se plaintiff in the
above-captioned case. I am competent to testify, and I am
testifying from my own knowledge. In the course of my
chemotherapy, despite being under the care of full-time nurses at
one of the finest cancer-treatment facilities in the country, I
found myself violently nauseated, retching uncontrollably, losing
control of my bowels, lying on the floor, covered with my own
vomit and excrement. </p>

<p>These same violent, uncontrollable symptoms would come on with
less than a minute's warning days after returning home. The only
relief I could obtain was from inhaled marijuana. Tablets
prescribed (including THC as Marinol or Dronobanol) were vomited
up undissolved. (During the years of my treatments, the cost of
the tablets went from 87 cents to more than $5 each.) </p>

<p>I undertook this lawsuit with grave misgivings as to
allocating so much of my limited time and energy (my cancer is
considered terminal) to a cause most likely to benefit only
others in the future. After a great deal of soul searching, I
elected to proceed because I believe it is every lawyer's duty to
attempt to remedy wrongs in our society, and not to simply be
'hired guns' to advocate for those who can afford to hire our
services. </p>

<p>I brought the lawsuit not as 'the latest in a series of
fruitless attempts to legalize marijuana and bypass the
legislature's exercise of its broad discretion...' as stated by
opposing counsel, but because it my educated opinion that the
legislature's system to regulate drugs has been corrupted by
zealots who contend that my suffering is justified to promote
some mythical 'greater good' of society. Further, my research
showed clearly that marijuana as medicine has not been considered
properly, both because of the misunderstandings and hysteria
surrounding the subject, and because drug certification in this
country is driven by the profit motives of pharmaceutical
companies, for which marijuana offers no resource to tap -- you
can't patent a plant. </p>

<p>I certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State
of Washington that the above is true. </p>

<p>Signed and dated in ________________, Washington this ___ day
of __________, </p>

<p>1995. </p>

<p>________________________ </p>

<p>Ralph Seeley </p>

<p>By resorting to such 'cheap shots' as accusing this lawyer of
'the latest in a series of fruitless attempts. . .', opposing
counsel has improperly inserted an ad hominem attack instead of
addressing the issues at hand. Her conclusory statements
regarding the nature of this lawsuit and its genesis, and the
motives of the plaintiff, should be given the consideration they
deserve -- none. </p>

<p>II. FACTS </p>

<p>Numerous mis-statements of facts as well as
mischaracterizations of facts appear in the defendant's brief: </p>

<p>The 'limited anecdotal evidence Plaintiff offers to support
his claim. . .' Defendant's brief, page 6 line 24. Primarily, the
plaintiff relies on the findings and conclusions of the DEA's own
Administrative Law Judge, Francis L. Young, whose 68-page opinion
followed hundreds of hours of testimony in three cities and
consideration of copious written evidence. A copy is attached as
Exhibit A. (Not provided to opposing counsel to conserve paper,
per discussion with opposing counsel, since counsel already has
copies.) The judge concluded that the provisions of [the
Controlled Substances] Act permit and require the transfer of
marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II. </p>

<p>* * * </p>

<p>There are those who. . .argue that the transfer of marijuana
to Schedule II will 'send a signal' that marijuana is 'OK'
generally for recreational use. </p>

<p>This argument is specious. It presents no valid reason for
refraining from taking an action required by law in light of the
evidence. If marijuana should be placed in Schedule II in
obedience to the law, then that is where marijuana should be
placed, regardless of misinterpretation of the placement by some.
. .The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to
override the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record,
of countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when
prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case. </p>

<p>The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has
been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great
numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under
medical supervision. It would be unreasonable arbitrary, and
capricious for the DEA to continue to stand between those
sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the
evidence of this record. </p>

<p>Opinion and Recommended Ruling, Findings of Fact, Conclusions
of Law and Decision of Administrative Law Judge, pages 67-68,
Docket No. 86-22, Dept. of Justice, Drug Enforcement
Administration ('Judge Youngis Opinion')(emphasis added). </p>

<p>For opposing counsel to state that this multi-year effort by
Judge Young, cited and quoted in plaintiff's opening brief,
constitutes 'the limited anecdotal evidence Plaintiff offers to
support his claim' (defendant's brief, page 6 line 24) is clear
indication of the disdain for legitimate lawmaking held by
opposing counsel -- unless the outcome conforms with that which
'everybody knows' is correct. </p>

<p>The opinion is worth reading in its entirety. It reveals the
endless circularity and self-fulfilling 'logic' of the
prohibitionists, and establishes many facts which are intuitively
obvious. Included in that category is the issue of the entire
pharmaceutical-approval process being designed to accommodate
companies interested in marketing new drugs, referred to in the
plaintiff's declaration, above. </p>

<p>Uncontroverted evidence further establishes that in this
country today 'new drugs' are developed by pharmaceutical
companies possessing resources sufficient to bear the enormous
expense of testing a new drug, obtaining FDA approval. . .and
marketing it successfully. No company undertakes the investment
required unless it has a patent on the drug, so it can recoup its
development costs and make a profit. . .Since the substance being
considered in this case is a natural plant rather than a
synthetic new drug, it is unreasonable to make FDA-type criteria
determinative of the issue in this case. . . </p>

<p>Judge Young's Oponion, page 33-34. The opinion is not 'limited
anecdotal evidence,' but is a compendium of research and
reasoning which, taken as a whole, offers compelling and
well-supported evidence for the plaintiff. </p>

<p>The defendants make statements such as 'Scientifically
reliable evidence shows that the currently available therapies
are more effective and do not carry with them the same risks.'
(Defendant's brief page 7 line 21.) Such statements are
conclusory, false, and in any event, irrelevant, since there is
no requirement to show that marijuana is risk-free or more
effective to all persons. </p>

<p>This sort of statement is reiterated by numerous 'experts'
throughout the defendant's brief, and in sworn statements
attached. All of them assert that 'new' drugs are better and
safer. None cite any tests comparing the drugs with marijuana,
for one of the primary reasons this plaintiff brought this
lawsuit: </p>

<p>The defendant's logic, and that of its experts, is flawed
because no comparison with marijuana can be done, because the
government will not permit possession of marijuana for
experiments. See Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F to plaintiff's
original brief. </p>

<p>In the only scientific test cited by either party which
actually utilized marijuana (Levitt, University of Manitoba,
1984, defendant's brief at page 16 line 1, deposition of Conrad,
Exhibit C, page 18-19), involved 20 patients undergoing
chemotherapy. Fifteen to 17 had nausea, vomiting or both. They
were given, at random, tobacco cigarettes, marijuana cigarettes,
or THC tablets. Out of the 20 patients, nine had no preference,
seven preferred THC, and four preferred marijuana cigarettes. See
Conrad Deposition, pages 18-19, attached as Exhibit C. </p>

<p>As Judge Young phrased it: there is no question but that this
record shows a great many physicians, and others, to have
'accepted' marijuana as having a medical use in treatment of
cancer patients' emesis. True, all physicians have not 'accepted'
it. But to require universal, 100% acceptance would be
unreasonable. Acceptance by 'a respectable minority' of
physicians is all that can reasonably be required. </p>

<p>The record here establishes conclusively that at least 'a
respectable minority' of physicians has 'accepted' marijuana as
having a 'medical use in treatment in the United States.' That
others may not makes no difference. </p>

<p>Judge Young's Opinion, page 29. What the defendant has done is
to round up some physicians and others who weigh in on the 'anti'
side. It is perfectly predictable that such persons may be
located and their sworn statements taken. That the defendant has
done so is of no value to the Court in evaluating the merits of
the plaintiff's case. </p>

<p>The question before this court does not involve some cosmic
overview of marijuana vis-a-vis every palliative drug in the
universe. Rather, the plaintiff has posed the question: Why does
our government permit the legal amelioration of suffering among
people who can absorb THC through their digestive systems
(through prescription of Marinol tablets), while subjecting the
plaintiff to exposure to arrest for possessing the same drug in a
form he can ingest through his lungs? </p>

<p>The example of heroin cited by the defendant (brief at page 7
line 7) makes the plaintiff's point. In the bottom half of page 7
the defendant makes the point that 'several successive
generations of effective anti-emetics now [are] currently
available to cancer chemotherapy patients.' Those 'several
generations' were developed and placed on the market since the
plaintiff was diagnosed with cancer in 1986. As the defendant
pointed out, it took 18 years for the medical community to
discover that heroin was more addictive than morphine. Like
heroin and other drugs (Thalidomide and Halcyon come to mind),
the new generations of anti-emetics may yet prove to be more
dangerous than helpful. Marijuana, on the other hand, has been
used therapeutically for 5,000 years, and there is no death yet
recorded as caused by an overdose. </p>

<p>The broad statements such as that quoted above concerning
other drugs with 'decreased risk' should be ignored by this court
as not supported by evidence, and not relevant to the outcome of
this case; the defendant has cited no scientific evidence
whatsoever that THC does not remain an effective, prescribed drug
for the relief of nausea in chemotherapy. </p>

<p>The statement by defendant that 'Dr. Grinspoon's testimony is
undeniably biased by his position that all drugs should be
available for recreational use' is false and should be ignored as
the red herring that it is. </p>

<p>The defendant's attorney undoubtedly bases such a false
accusation on Dr. Grinspoon's embracing of the 'harm reduction'
model of drug laws used successfully in The Netherlands, where
drug abuse is treated as a medical, not a legal, problem. Hard
drugs remain unlawful in that country, but are available through
medical channels to the addicted. Thus, they have a small
fraction of the drug addicts compared to those in the United
States, and an even smaller fraction of the secondary (crime)
problems associated with drug addiction, since there is no black
market driving drug costs up and creating huge profit motives for
the unscrupulous. That Dr. Grinspoon embraces such a model in
contrast to our own policies (build more prisons, fill them up),
is no reason to question his knowledge or research-supported
opinion on the medical issues at hand. (For some overall insight
into the circular logic and straightforward falsehoods employed
by our federal officials in the 'war on drugs,' see the attached
pamphlets, exhibits B and E, and note the hundreds of citations
to authority.) </p>

<p>In fact, Dr. Grinspoonis book, The Speed Culture: Amphetamine
Use and Abuse in America, Harvard University Press, 1975, was
among the first to sound the warning that 'popping little white
pills' (in the words of the country-western song 'Six Days On The
Road') was far more harmful than anyone was giving it credit for
at that time. In the aftermath of the publishing of that book,
the potential for harm of that class of drugs became more widely
known, and the drugs became more carefully controlled. </p>

<p>Dr. Grinspoon is a physician and scientist with impressive
memberships in professional associations, and publication both in
books for lay persons and in scientific literature, including the
prestigious, juried New England Journal of Medicine. (His
Curriculum Vitae is attached to those portions of his deposition
submitted by the defendants.) His views are 'refuted' by the
defendants with an anonymous author who writes for U.S. News and
World Report, who in turn cites a former politician (defendant's
brief, page 14), who in turn recites the tired ritual statement
'Children who smoke pot are 85 times more likely to use cocaine.'
This myth is not supported by fact. See 'Myth #11' of Exposing
Marijuana Myths, attached as Exhibit B, and the scientific and
authoritative publications cited. </p>

<p>The defendant's attorney confuses correlation with causation.
It is absolutely true, upon statistical analysis, that, for
example, persons with larger feet are more adept at mathematics
than those with small feet. It is equally true that the density
of fire hydrants accurately predicts the incidence of diabetes.
The former is true because infants can't do math at all, and have
small feet. The latter is true because the density of fire
hydrants predicts the density of population, thus the statistical
appearance of any disease that occurs randomly throughout the
population. According to the logic presented in the defendant's
brief, we should stretch person's feet to increase their ability
at mathematics; outlaw fire hydrants to eliminate diabetes; and
continue to outlaw the relief of suffering among desperately ill
people to eliminate cocaine use. </p>

<p>What most obviously is true is that 100 percent of the persons
using cocaine are using cocaine -- a Schedule II drug. Using the
drug without a prescription carries exactly the same penalties as
using a Schedule I drug. So what 'signal' is being sent by
changing marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II? </p>

<p>Whether 85 percent of pot-smoking children eventually use
cocaine is completely irrelevant to this case. In any event, this
seems to be a re-hash of the argument that to allow marijuana use
by prescription will 'send a signal' to young people, who will
then use other illegal drugs. This was addressed as 'specious' by
Judge Young. See Opinion of Young excerpt, supra. </p>

<p>The 'facts' presented on this subject are an attempt to
sidetrack the Court, and should be ignored by the Court for what
they are -- false statements of fact supporting illogical
analysis, and in any event, not relevant to the controversy at
hand. </p>

<p>The argument that 'there are no safe standards' because 'The
marijuana plant contains over 400 different chemicals and is not
chemically consistent' is another contention that is irrelevant
and not supported by evidence. (See defendantis brief, page 17.) </p>

<p>As established by the Affidavit of McKinney, Exhibit D,
attached, the technology exists to produce pharmacologically pure
THC from the natural marijuana (hemp) plant, which can be smoked
and absorbed through the lungs in its pure form. </p>

<p>Thus, if this '400 chemicalsi argument were a legitimate
reason to force the plaintiff to continue choosing between
suffering and breaking the law, there is a simple method of
overcoming the problem. However, this entire line of argument is
clearly a smokescreen (sorry) for attempting to legitimize what
'everybody knows.' Put another way, however many chemicals may be
created by burning the leaves of the hemp plant, there is still
no evidence that in 5,000 years of use, it has ever caused a
death. The same cannot be said of aspirin, which kills
approximately 180 persons per year, and caffeine, which kills
approximately 1,000. See Compare Legal Drugs With Illegal Drugs,
Washington Hemp Education Network, page 10-11 and note 58. </p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the pamphlets attached as Exhibits B and
E contain 66 and 107 citations to legitimate authorities,
respectively. This is more of the 'limited anecdotal evidence'
which the defendant counters with unsupported opinions. </p>

<p>The '400 unknown chemicals' argument is without merit. The
facts establish that burning the leaves or buds of the hemp plant
and inhaling the smoke relieves grievous suffering, with
virtually no risk. That is established by the legitimate inquiry
and report by the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief
Administrative Law Judge, who considered that and other arguments
before issuing his report. (To eliminate pronoun confusion, the
late Judge Francis Young was a man.) The plaintiff brought this
suit because the process following that report was corrupted, to
the detriment of the sick and helpless. The defendant now
attempts to regurgitate as 'fact' those opinions which have
already been shown not to be factual, not to be relevant, and
which would not change the outcome of a legitimate inquiry such
as the plaintiff hopes is the result of this suit, even if they
were true. </p>

<p>III. ARGUMENT </p>

<p>The arguments presented by the defendant are excruciatingly
circular and self-validating. Expert after expert states that
scientific studies do not support the plaintiff's position. But
the only scientific study actually utilizing vegetable-state
marijuana showed that some of the patients preferred it.
Deposition of Conrad, Exhibit C page 19. Meanwhile, no further
studies are permitted, because the government won't allow them,
because the drug is illegal. It is illegal because no scientific
evidence supports its use. (See Affidavit of Doblin, attached to
plaintiffis opening brief as Exhibit F.) And the circle starts
again. </p>

<p>A. THE DEFENDANT HAS MIS-STATED THE BURDEN ON THE PLAINTIFF,
WHO MAY PREVAIL UNDER SEVERAL THEORIES OR ANALYSES. </p>

<p>The defendants mis-characterize this lawsuit as a challenge to
'the legislature's classification system for controlled
substances on its face.' Defendant's brief, page 5,6. The entire
analysis is based on that assumption. Included in the defendant's
analysis is the statement that, because this is a 'facial'
challenge, the plaintiff must overcome the presumption of
constitutionality of a statute 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' </p>

<p>The plaintiff is not challenging the statute as
unconstitutional 'on its face.' The plaintiff concedes that the
legislature had every right to enact the Uniform Controlled
Substances Act, RCW .50, in 1971, and to place marijuana in
Schedule I based on the information available at that time, just
as Congress had every right to enact similar federal statutes. </p>

<p>However, in both the federal and state statutes, officials are
charged with reviewing drugs to place them in different
categories as new facts are brought to light. This process was
followed to the extent that Judge Young spent several years of
effort examining evidence and issuing a report and
recommendation, attached as Exhibit A. What followed was a
shameful corruption of the system by law enforcement officials,
not medical persons. </p>

<p>In essence, the head of the DEA stated, 'I don't care what the
evidence shows or what Judge Young recommends based on the
evidence, marijuana is staying in Schedule I because I say so.'
This was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
pointed out the flawed logic -- a drug that is illegal can never
meet the criteria of 'currently accepted medical use.' The head
of the DEA then re-worded his opinion, still refusing to
re-schedule the drug, and his new language withstood the narrow,
technical test applied by the circuit court. </p>

<p>This plaintiff brings this lawsuit before a Washington judge,
based on the Washington constitution, because our constitution
contains more powerful protections of individual rights. It is
this plaintiff's hope that under Washington law the broad,
self-serving statements concerning the 'greater good' of society,
unsupported by evidence, will not overcome this individual's
right to relieve his suffering without breaking the law. </p>

<p>/ / / </p>

<p>1. The 'equal protection' analysis borrowed from the federal
government should not apply, but the plaintiff should prevail
even if the court employs it. </p>

<p>In the plaintiff's opening brief, Justice Utteris dissenting
opinion in State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 282, 814 P.2d 652
(1991), was adopted by reference. </p>

<p>The analysis set forth calls for a completely different
approach to our Privileges and Immunities clause, Const. Art. 1
ss 12, than the 'levels of scrutiny' borrowed from the federal
analysis of the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution. Below, plaintiff navigates through that
analysis. </p>

<p>The defendant contends that the Court should utilize the
'levels of scrutiny' analysis, and that the court should adopt
the lowest level of scrutiny. </p>

<p>First, if the Court is to indulge in this analysis, the
highest level of scrutiny should be used, since the right of a
doctor to relieve the suffering of his patient, and the right of
a patient to have the relief of suffering available without being
subjected to arrest, are fundamental rights. This can be found in
various cases stated as a right to medical privacy, or a liberty
interest protected by due process. See: In re Ingram, 102 Wn.2d
827 (1984) (incompetent person's right to medical
self-determination); O'Hartigan v. Dept. of Personnel, 118 Wn.2d
111 (1991) (level of scrutiny re: privacy); In re Colyer, 99
Wn.2d 114 (1983) (privacy in medical decisions); State v. Koome,
84 Wn.2d 901 (1975) (doctor and patient's medical privacy); In re
Hamlin, 102 Wn.2d 810 (1984)(right to choose termination of
medical treatment -- here we are asserting a right to choose a
particular medical treatment less harmful than the treatments
permitted). These are in addition to the citations in the
plaintiffis opening brief. </p>

<p>Whatever level of scrutiny the Court chooses to apply (if
any), the plaintiff should prevail, because the countervailing
interest of the state is illusory. Which is to say, even the
'rational relationship' test used at the lowest level of scrutiny
provides no rationale for the plaintiff to be forced to lie on
the floor covered with his own excrement and vomit, or
alternatively to break the law. </p>

<p>The only benefit to the State that can be discerned in
defendant's argument is that (1) the State has a duty to 'ensure
the public of the adequacy, efficacy and safety of substances
used in the treatment of illnesses,' defendant's brief at page 5
line 1; to 'protect ill and vulnerable members of the public from
unsafe and/or ineffective medical treatments,' Id. line 16, and
by implication, to prevent abuse of the drug on a larger scale,
Id. Page 19. </p>

<p>The state has provided only conclusory, illogical and
non-factual statements to support the contention that maintaining
marijuana in Schedule I supports any of those goals. </p>

<p>In fact, the clear evidence is to the contrary. Surely, nobody
denies that thousands of patients in the shoes if the plaintiff
are smoking marijuana for the relief of their symptoms. Because
the drug is in Schedule I, we must all obtain the drug on the
black market, where its purity is unknown and unregulated. By
placing the drug in Schedule II, we would be able to obtain
pharmaceutically pure medication -- the stated goal of this sort
of regulation. </p>

<p>To hold that the Equal Protection/Levels-of-Scrutiny analysis
borrowed from the federal government and applied to our
Privileges and Immunities clause calls for the continued
prohibition of this valuable herb as medicine is to stretch legal
fictions to the level of the absurd. </p>

<p>2. Under the 'privileges and immunities' analysis properly
applied to our state's constitutional clause, the plaintiff
should prevail. </p>

<p>As Justice Utter pointed out in State v. Smith, supra,
(Exhibit G to plaintiff's opening brief), the analysis which
should be applied under Wash. Const. Art. I ss 12 is by applying
four questions: (1) was the challenged state action properly
performed under lawful authority; (2) does the action implicate a
'privilege' or 'immunity'; (3) does the action allegedly
discriminate against an individual or a class; and if so, (4) is
the discrimination permissible? Id., 117 Wn.2d at 288
(parenthetical numbers added). There is no requirement to
establish a 'class,'i which squares with the plain language of
the Constitution: </p>

<p>No law shall be passed granting to any citizen. . .privileges
or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally belong
to all citizens. . . </p>

<p>Const. Art. 1 ss 12. As cited by Justice Utter: </p>

<p>The clause. . .may be invoked by an individual who demands
equality of treatment with other individuals as well as by one
who demands equal privileges or immunities for a class to which
he or she belongs. </p>

<p>State v. Smith, supra (citations omitted). </p>

<p>Here, the plaintiff is simply pointing out that other persons,
who can absorb THC through their digestive systems, are given the
privilege of ending their suffering and immunity from arrest for
possession of THC, while the plaintiff, whose suffering can be
ended through absorbing THC through his lungs, is arbitrarily
denied the privilege of ending his suffering and the immunity
from arrest through prescription. </p>

<p>The first three questions posed in the analysis, then, are
answered 'yes.' </p>

<p>The fourth question remains - 'Is the discrimination
permissible?' </p>

<p>According to the only serious, long-term study by a neutral
official, Judge Francis Young, it is not; he stated that it would
be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious to withhold the drug
from persons such as the plaintiff. Further, the only comparative
scientific study (Levitt, supra) determined that for some
patients, smoked marijuana was the treatment preferred. No other
experimental data is available because the government prohibits
the experiments. See Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F of
plaintiff's original brief. </p>

<p>The plaintiff and thousands of persons in his shoes are not
ignorant, illiterate or stupid. We read medical literature, legal
documents (such as the Young opinion), and we experiment to end
our suffering. We use marijuana because it works, as Judge Young
found, and because other drugs do not. </p>

<p>The evidence' supporting the value to the state of the ongoing
discrimination against the plaintiff is circular, self-serving,
and makes a mockery of both procedural and substantive law.
Further, it makes criminals of society's most helpless people,
and their families. There is no justification for the
discrimination, and in the name of compassion, reason, and to end
the massive mockery of the law by medical users across the
country, this court should find that the ongoing classification
of marijuana as a Schedule I drug is a violation of the
plaintiff's rights under Article I ss 12 of the Constitution of
the State of Washington. </p>

<p>B. THE DEFENDANT'S CONTENTION THAT THE WASHINGTON SUPREME
COURT HAS ALREADY REJECTED PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM IS REFUTED BY THE
OUTDATED CITATIONS RELIED UPON. </p>

<p>As stated above, the primary evidence relied upon by the
plaintiff is Judge Young's opinion, issued in 1988. In Section B
of the defendantis brief, defendant cites a 1981 case, contending
that the state's supreme court has already ruled on this issue..
Clearly, the Washington Supreme Court has not analyzed this issue
in light of the massive effort put forth by Judge Young, and his
68-page report recommending that marijuana be re-scheduled. </p>

<p>Further, in State v. Smith, 93 Wn.2d 329, 610 P.2d 869 (1980),
the court held that statutory punishment for possession of
marijuana did not rise to the level of cruel and unusual
punishment. Justice Dolliver wrote a 14-page dissent, in which
two other justices concurred. Thus, only two more Justices would
be required to find marijuana legal without analyzing its medical
value. </p>

<p>Under these circumstances, to claim that our Supreme Court has
put this matter to rest is, in a word, ridiculous. </p>

<p>C. THE FEDERAL PROCESS FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF JUDGE YOUNG'S
OPINION WAS CORRUPTED, AND WASHINGTON COURTS ARE UNDER NO
OBLIGATION TO DENY THE PLAINTIFF THE PROTECTION OF WASHINGTON'S
CONSTITUTION BASED ON FEDERAL BUREAUCRATIC TURF WARS. </p>

<p>The plaintiff set out the outlines of 'the federal farce' in
pages 14 through 18 of his opening brief. The plaintiff, as a
lawyer and officer of the court, does not label federal agency
and court actions as 'farce' lightly. But no other, less
pejorative word applies. </p>

<p>The overarching question is: Why are we letting the police
make our medical decisions? </p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration is a law-enforcement
agency. It is not charged with the advancement of science or the
alleviation of suffering. </p>

<p>Congress put in place a method for evaluating whether a drug
should be re-scheduled upon discovery of new evidence of more or
less efficacy or harm than was known when the drug was originally
scheduled. Judge Young followed that procedure, and found that
the law 'requires' marijuana to be re-scheduled to alleviate 'the
legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of countless
sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when prescribed by
a physician.' Young Opinion, page 67-8. </p>

<p>After that, the 'drug czar' or 'top cop' or whatever currently
accepted name is in vogue for the head drug-law enforcer simply
invoked the bureaucratic power of ipse dixit to deny
rescheduling. </p>

<p>It is well-established law that Washington's constitution
provides safeguards to personal liberty which are absent in the
federal constitution. Indeed, Article I ss 1, cited but not
quoted by the defendant, states unequivocally that governments. .
.are established to protect and maintain individual rights. </p>

<p>Id. In addition to the cases cited in plaintiff's opening
brief, see State v. Bartholomew, 101 Wn.2d 631, 639 (1984)(due
process); and State v. Young, 123 Wn.2d 173 (1994)(right to
privacy). </p>

<p>Thus, while federal courts may bow to the power of federal law
enforcement agencies and their head bureaucrats in determining
which citizens shall suffer for lack of medication and who shall
not, the judges in this state are not bound by those decisions. </p>

<p>The dozens of opinions of federal courts and doctors to the
effect that marijuana is not the best medicine for many people
most of the time is irrelevant. This plaintiff found that
marijuana relieved excruciating, demeaning, demoralizing
suffering in a manner that no prescribed medicine could begin to
approach. (Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B to original brief,
which the plaintiff urges the Court to re-read in its entirety.)
This plaintiff's experience is not unique, as asserted by Judge
Young's opinion citing to 'countless' sufferers. Young opinion at
68. </p>

<p>The invoking of federal procedure in Section C of the
defendant's brief is of no consequence to resolving this dispute
under the Washington constitution. </p>

<p>D. THE CITATION TO THE 'RELEVANT MEDICAL COMMUNITY' REJECTING
MARIJUANA IS A RESULT, NOT A CAUSE, OF MARIJUANA'S ILLEGAL
STATUS. </p>

<p>The smear tactics against Lester Grinspoon, M.D., engaged in
by the defendant in their brief at Section D, has been addressed
above, in the 'facts' section. </p>

<p>As stated and reiterated supra, only one experiment has been
reported which actually used vegetable-state marijuana in
comparison with other anti-emetics. A substantial minority of the
patients treated preferred it. See deposition of Conrad, Exhibit
C, page 19. </p>

<p>No other experiments have been done, because the federal
government prohibits them. See Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F to
plaintiff's opening brief. </p>

<p>So what we have is opinion based on rhetoric stacked on top of
other opinion based on rumor. This is not a battle of opinions.
However many credentialled persons the defendant may round up to
state that 'marijuana is not proven. . .' is of no consequence.
This plaintiff had an experience that cannot be disputed by
'experts' who have not shared the experience. The years and reams
of paper expended by Judge Young to arrive at an overview have
the validity of having been performed by someone out to determine
the truth, not someone brought in to testify on one side of an
issue. </p>

<p>As the defendant points out (brief at page 7), it took 18
years of use by the medical community before they figured out
that heroin was a more addictive painkiller than morphine.
Marijuana has not had the benefit of 18 years of use by the
modern medical community. How then do these 'experts' dare to
claim they can reach valid conclusions? </p>

<p>As the defendant also points out, more studies need to be
done, a point virtually all agree upon. Placing marijuana in
Schedule II would result in more studies -- virtually every
patient in the plaintiff's shoes would be the subject of those
studies, by the mere gathering of statistical data. </p>

<p>The defendant labels their group of 'experts' as the 'relevant
medical community.' Plaintiff asserts that the 'relevant medical
community' is the group of persons who have undergone the same
horrendous chemotherapy nausea, vomiting and loss of bowel
control as the plaintiff. Gathering statistics from that
community is difficult, since many of the people die, and others
are reluctant to admit to breaking the law. But according to
Judge Young's opinion, they are 'countless.' </p>

<p>The 'relevant community' argument is an attempt to transfer
the legal issue to 'my expert is better than yours.' It has no
place in this litigation, and should be ignored by the Court. </p>

<p>E. THE 'NO SAFE STANDARDS' IS BOTH FALSE AND A SPECIOUS
ARGUMENT AGAINST 'SELF-TITRATION.' </p>

<p>The plaintiff is regularly sent home from the hospital with
enough narcotics (oxycodone, Dilaudid (hydromorphone), etc.) to
kill several people. He is expected to take the tablets as
directed. To do otherwise would be unsafe. The plaintiff could
easily ingest a lethal dose of the drug, as is true of many
prescription drugs. There is no lethal dose of vegetable-state
marijuana. See Exhibit E page 8 and supporting endnotes. </p>

<p>Instead of 'self-titration,' which the plaintiff indulges in
by smoking a few puffs of marijuana and waiting a few minutes to
see if it is enough (see Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B to
original brief), the defendant asks that the Court enforce the
current law requiring that THC be administered in pre-measured
doses, which results in much worse side effects, and much longer
debilitation from those side effects. </p>

<p>Again, in the only serious fact-finding effort made on the
subject, Judge Young specifically held that marijuana has been
accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of
very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical
supervision. </p>

<p>Young Opinion at 68. What is true, and was raised supra, is
that currently, the purity of black-market marijuana can be
questionable, which would cease to be a problem if the drug were
available by prescription. </p>

<p>F. THE 'NO NEW SCIENTIFICALLY RELIABLE EVIDENCE' ARGUMENT IS
MORE OF THE SAME CIRCULAR, SELF-SERVING, OUTDATED NONSENSE. </p>

<p>Defendant's argument in Section F is a rehash of arguments
made and refuted above. Note that all cases pre-date Judge
Young's opinion. </p>

<p>And once again, Why is there no new scientific evidence?
Because the federal government prohibits experiments. Affidavit
of Doblin, Exhibit F to original brief. </p>

<p>G. MARIJUANA HAS A 'HIGH POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE:' SO WHAT? </p>

<p>The plaintiff frankly believes the 'abuse' of marijuana is
overstated and misunderstood throughout the judicial and law
enforcement communities. But even conceding that it has a 'high
potential for abuse,' that is of no relevance. Opium and cocaine
also have high potentials for abuse, and they are Schedule II
drugs. </p>

<p>Again, Judge Young noted that Marijuana can be harmful.
Marijuana is abused. But the same is true of dozens of drugs or
substances which are listed in Schedule II so that they can be
employed in treatment by physicians in proper cases, despite
their abuse potential. Young Opinion at 67. This is simply not a
valid reason to make the plaintiff suffer as he was forced to do
without breaking the law. </p>

<p>I. DEFENDANT'S ARGUMENTS UNDER SECTIONS I, J AND K OF
DEFENDANT'S BRIEF ARE ADDRESSED ABOVE, AND IN PLAINTIFF'S OPENING
BRIEF. </p>

<p>The defendants re-hash old arguments, and fail utterly to
defend against plaintiff's contention that he is protected by
Article I ss 32, the 'frequent recurrence to fundamental
principles' clause. </p>

<p>1. Of course the state can control 'drugs of abuse,' but so
what? </p>

<p>The argument set forth in Section J of defendant's brief
implies that the plaintiff believes the state should not
'control' marijuana. Nothing could be further from the truth.
History teaches us that prohibition results in loss of control,
while regulation (and sane laws) result in control. We need only
look to the experiment with national alcohol prohibition. </p>

<p>The state is not now 'controlling' marijuana use. It is
prohibiting marijuana use. The plaintiff is asking the Court to
change that, so the state will control the use of marijuana for
medical purposes, the same as it does with cocaine, opium, and
other potentially harmful but extremely helpful drugs. There is
no question that the state has the power to regulate the use of
marijuana, and that is what the state should do. Placing
desperately ill people in jail for the use of a valuable
medicine, however, is a crude and cruel method of regulation, and
the state should get out of that business forthwith. </p>

<p>J. THE 'FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES' CLAUSE
DICTATES THE PLACING OF MARIJUANA IN SCHEDULE II. </p>

<p>There is little case law interpreting Article I ss 32. Absent
reasons to do otherwise, words of laws should be read to assert
their standard, understood meanings. (This itself is a
fundamental principle A valid interpretation of the clause, and
the reason for it, lies in the common human experience of taking
a number of small, seemingly reasonable steps, then finding
oneself in an unreasonable situation. It becomes time to pause,
take stock, perhaps return to the last intersection and try a
different road. </p>

<p>That is what is needed here, now. When marijuana was placed in
Schedule I, it belonged in Schedule I. With Judge Young's careful
research and analysis, it should have been placed in Schedule II
in 1988. </p>

<p>We now have compassionate judges granting quasi-judicial
permission to ill people to use this valuable drug to ease their
suffering, which amounts to 'prescription by going to jail.' See
Declaration of Subin, Exhibit E of plaintiff's opening brief. It
is a fundamental principle that judges should not be placed in
that position by the continued enforcement of unreasonable laws
levied against desperately ill and helpless citizens. The
plaintiff asks this Court to review the 'fundamental principles'
discussion in the opening brief at pages 36-39, and to find that
the plaintiff's rights, and the rights of countless others,
established under that clause, are violated by the continued
placement of marijuana in Schedule I. </p>

<p>IV. CONCLUSION </p>

<p>Whether under the federal 'equal protection' analysis, under
the separate 'privileges and immunities' analysis, the 'frequent
recurrence to fundamental principles' analysis, or under all
three, the Court should grant the plaintiff's motion for summary
judgment, and issue a declaration that the continued placement of
marijuana under Schedule I of the Uniform Controlled Substances
Act is a violation of the plaintiff's rights as protected by the
Constitution of the State of Washington. </p>

<h1>Marijuana as Antiemetic Medicine: </h1>

<p><b>A Survey of Oncologists' Experiences and Attitudes</b> </p>

<p><b>by Richard Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"> </p>

<p><b>Abstract: </b>A random-sample anonymous survey of the
members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was
conducted in the spring of 1990 measuring the attitudes and
experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use
of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was
mailed to about one-third (N = 2430) of all U.S.-based ASCO
members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1035). More than 44%
of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of
marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer
chemotherapy patient. Almost half (48%) would prescribe marijuana
to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group,
respondents considered (smoked) marijuana to be somewhat more
effective than the legally available (oral) synthetic THC
(Marinol) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed
an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be
available by prescription. </p>

<p>These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a
&quot;currently accepted medical use,&quot; an issue in an
ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether
marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription
along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates
that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is
more extensive, and their opinions of it more favorable, than the
regulatory authorities appear to have believed. </p>

<h1>PSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF MARIHUANA INTOXICATION </h1>

<p><b>Samuel Allentuck, MD, and Karl Bowman, MD<br>
</b></p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>Introduction by David Solomon: (The Marihuana Papers) </p>

<p><i>Because it flatly contradicted many of the marihuana myths,
the following paper caused something of a stir both in the press
and in medical circles when it was read at the ninety-eighth
annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, held in
Boston in May 1942. The findings of Dr. Allentuck and Dr. Bowman
- both practicing psychiatrists - were based upon exacting
studies which they conducted for the Mayor's Committee on
Marihuana. Dr. Allentuck, whose medical degree is reinforced by a
doctorate in biochemistry, was the clinical director of the
Committee.</i> </p>

<p><i>&quot;The Psychiatric Aspects of Marihuana
Intoxication&quot; was originally published by the American
Journal of Psychiatry in September 1942. It has since taken its
place as one of the key reference works in the medical literature
on marihuana.<br>
</i></p>

<p>Marihuana has been known as a passport to euphoria since
ancient times. It has fascinated men of imagination, and
descriptions of its effects upon the mind and body have been
given in popular and scientific literature countless times. The
literature has been adequately considered by Walton (1) and by
Bromberg (2), and will therefore not be reviewed at the present
time. </p>

<p>The observations to be presented here are based on research
conducted in New York City under the auspices of the Mayor's
Committee on Marihuana. Studies were made of the effect of
marihuana on a series of 77 subjects, including some who had
previously used marihuana for varying periods- of time. The work
was done at Welfare Hospital with the assistance of Drs. Frank
Anker and Louis Gitzelter. A monograph based on this and
collaborative work is now in the course of preparation, and deals
with the pharmacological, clinical, therapeutic, social,
psychological, and psychiatric aspects of marihuana. This paper
consists mainly of a description of the psychiatric
manifestations caused by the drug. </p>

<p>The active principle in the plant is an oil, occurring in
maximum concentration in the flowering tops. The drug is ingested
or inhaled after being prepared for use in various ways in
different parts of the world. In this hemisphere it is usually
smoked, but may be eaten in the form of candy, or drunk in
various liquid preparations. The strength and quality of the
effect of marihuana vary with the geographical source of the
plant. It is strongest in the African derivative, less strong in
its Central American form, and weakest as found in the temperate
zones of this country. </p>

<p>Marihuana is unique in the reactions it produces in the users,
although its physiological effects have been likened to those of
the atropine group of drugs, and its psychic effects to those of
alcohol. The following is a clinical picture of the sequence of
events resulting from the ingestion of marihuana. The sequence of
events is the same whether the drug is ingested or inhaled, but
the latter produces its effects more rapidly. </p>

<p>Within one-half to one hour after the ingestion of marihuana
the conjunctiva reddens, the pupils dilate and react sluggishly
to light; photophobia, lacrimation, tremulousness of the eyelids,
and nystagmus upon lateral gaze become evident. Ophthalmoscopic
examination reveals nothing unusual in the nerve head, vessels or
retinal background. The vision for distance, proximity, and color
changes but slightly. The tongue becomes tremulous and dry, and
the mouth and throat patched, suggesting a diminution in salivary
secretion. Cardiovascular changes consist of an increase in the
radial pulse rate and a rise in the blood pressure which closely
follows the pulse increase. The extremities become tremulous, and
there are involuntary twitching, hyperreflexia, increased
sensitivity to touch, pressure, and pain stimuli. Pyramidal tract
signs are not elicited. There is equilibratory and
nonequilibratory ataxia, as revealed by marked swaying and
abnormal finger-to-finger test performance. Not all of these
phenomena occur in every sub ject, but when any of them does, it
lasts for about twelve hours. Elaborate laboratory studies of the
effects of marihuana intoxication for shorter and longer periods,
on users and non-users, reveal no significant systematic
alterations. </p>

<p>Mental phenomena arise two to three hours after ingestion, or
almost immediately after inhalation of the drug. The subject
admits being &quot;high.&quot; This state is characterized by a
sensation of &quot;floating in air,&quot; &quot;falling on
waves,&quot; lightness or dizziness in the head, ringing in the
ears, and heaviness in the limbs. Euphoria is first manifested
objectively in volubility and increased psychomotor activity, and
later subjectively in a delicious and confused lassitude.
Distance and time intervals subpectively appear elastic. In three
to six hours after ingestion of marihuana, hunger, manifested
mainly in a craving for sweets, and a feeling of fatigue and
sleepiness become prominent. The individual may sleep from one to
six hours and on awakening is &quot;down&quot;, that is, he no
longer feels &quot;high.&quot; The clinical phenomena may linger
for another few hours. </p>

<p>The mental status usually reveals a hyperactive, apprehensive,
loquacious, somewhat suspicious individual. His stream of talk
may be circumstantial; his mood may be elevated, but he does not
harbor frank abnormal, mental content such as delusions,
hallucinations, phobias, or autistic thinking. Attention,
concentration and comprehension are only slightly disturbed, as
is evidenced by the fact that the results in his educational
achievement tests are only slightly lowered. </p>

<p>Marihuana may precipitate a psychosis in an unstable,
disorganized personality, when it is taken in amounts greater
than he can tolerate. Under such circumstances, the previously
mentioned physical and psychic manifestations become
quantitatively greater and new events arise. The respiration
becomes labored; pallor and perspiration become evident;
tachycardia and irregularity of pulse occur. The subject
complains of urinary urgency, diarrhea and nausea; and may retch
or actually vomit. His apprehension may be interrupted by
laughing and weeping, by volubility or mutism. Marked
irritability, negativism, and cerea flexibilitas-like phenomena
may be elicited. The subject may assume grotesque, statuesque
positions. He may experience visual pseudohallucinations in the
form of flashes of light and apparitions. Micropsia and macropsia
may occur. More intense intoxication may elicit auditory
hallucinations similar to those met with in the alcoholic
psychoses, such as alcoholic hallucinosis or delirium tremens. </p>

<p>Limitations of time will not permit detailed description of
the nine psychoses precipitated in our series of 77 subjects.
However, it should be noted that a characteristic marihuana psy
chosis does not exist. Marihuana will not produce a psychosis de
novo in a well-integrated, stable person. In unstable users the
personality factor and the mood preceding the ingestion of
marihuana will color any psychosis that may result. In no two of
the cases developing psychoses in our series were the patterns
similar. Marihuana psychosis is protean in its manifestations and
may be mistaken for schizophrenic, affective, paranoid organic,
psychoneurotic or psychopathic reaction types. Should a psychosis
be precipitated in an unstable personality it may last only a few
hours or it may continue for a few weeks. It may be controlled by
withdrawal of the drug and the administration of barbiturates
After a few hours of sleep following the psychotic episode
treated with barbiturates, the patient may awaken with complete
memory for his experience and with his insight unimpaired. </p>

<p>The prolonged effects of the drug are strongly subjective, and
consist of an increase in fatigability and vague generalized
aches and pains. The aftermath of marihuana intoxication
resembles an alcoholic &quot;hangover.&quot; However, in contrast
to alcoholics, marihuana users do not continue their indulgence
beyond the point of euphoria, and soon learn to avoid becoming
ill by remaining at a pleasurable distance from their maximum
capacity for the drug. It may be mentioned that marihuana is no
more aphrodisiac than is alcohol. Unlike damiana, yohimbin,
testosterone propionate, etc. which produce genital engorgement
directly, marihuana, like alcohol, acts only indirectly through
the cerebral cortex in this respect. </p>

<p>Marihuana differs from the opium derivatives in that it does
not give rise to a biological or physiological dependence.
Discontinuance of the drug after its prolonged use does not
result in withdrawal symptoms. The psychic habituation to
marihuana is not as strong as to tobacco or alcohol. Use of
marihuana over a long period of time may conduce to ingestion of
progressively larger amounts merely through accessibility and
familiarity. This increment however does not give rise to a more
intense pleasurable experience. Thus a person experiencing
pleasure with two marihuana cigarettes does not achieve any
greater pleasure with six cigarettes, though he may indulge in
them. </p>

<p>A physiologically active constituent has been isolated from
the crude marihuana by Dr. Roger Adams and his associates,
working in the Noyes Chemical Laboratory of the University of
Illinois, in Urbana, as was reported by Dr. Adams in his Harvey
Lecture in February 1942. This substance or its synthetic
equivalent elicits somatic and psychic phenomena identical to
those obtained with the crude drug. Only brief mention need be
made of these substances since they are ex plained in detail in
Dr. Adams' report. Thus, natural tetrahydrocannabinol is obtained
by the isomerization of cannabidiol, through the action of
p-toluene sulphonic acid. Synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol is
l-hydroxy-3-n-amyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-7,8,9, 1 0-tetrahydro-6-
dibenzopyran. Another synthetic equivalent called synhexyl is I
-hydroxy-3-n-hexyl-6,6,9- trimethyl-7,8,9,
10tetrahydra-6-dibenzopyran. The natural product is most potent,
the synthetic equivalent least potent, and the synhexyl ranks
between them. </p>

<p>In the course of our investigation we studied the therapeutic
application of marihuana derivatives and allied synthetics to
opiate drug addiction, functional and organic depressions, and
psychoneurotic disorders in which dysphoria and anorexia existed.
The rationale for such therapeutic use was that, while exerting
no permanent deleterious effects, marihuana or its derivatives or
synthetics give rise to pleasurable sensations, calmness and
relaxation, and increase the appetite. </p>

<p>A series of cases were selected from among drug addicts
undergoing treatment. Subjective and objective criteria were
employed. Comparative results were charted for the gradual
withdrawal, total withdrawal, and marihuana derivative
substitution, as methods of treatment. A modification of the
technic of Kolb and Himmelsbach was employed in studying the
abstinence syndrome. Forty-nine subjects were studied. The
results in general, although still inconclusive, suggest that the
marihuana substitution method of treatment is superior. Thus, the
withdrawal symptoms were ameliorated or eliminated sooner, the
patient was in a better frame of mind, his spirits were elevated,
his physical condition was more rapidly rehabilitated, and he
expressed a wish to resume his occupation sooner. </p>

<p>In conclusion it is worthy of note that marihuana is probably
taken by its users for the purpose of producing sensations
comparable to those produced by alcohol. It causes a lowering of
inhibitions comparable to that elicited by alcohol in a blood
concentration of 2-3 mg. per cent. The user may speak and act
more freely, is inclined to daydreaming, and experiences a
feeling of calm and pleasurable relaxation. </p>

<p>Marihuana, by virtue of its property of lowering inhibitions,
accentuates all traits of personality, both those harmful and
those beneficial. It does not impel its user to take spontaneous
action, but may make his response to stimuli more emphatic than
it normally would be. Increasingly larger doses of marihuana are
not necessary in order that the long-term user may capture the
original degree of pleasure. </p>

<p>Marihuana, like alcohol, does not alter the basic personality,
but by relaxing inhibitions may permit antisocial tendencies
formerly suppressed to come to the fore. Marihuana does not of
itself give rise to antisocial behavior. </p>

<p>There is no evidence to suggest that the continued use of
marihuana is a stepping-stone to the use of opiates. Prolonged
use of the drug does not lead to physical, mental, or moral
degeneration, nor have we observed any permanent deleterious
effects from its continued use. Quite the contrary, marihuana and
its derivatives and allied synthetics have potentially valuable
therapeutic applications which merit future investigation. <br>

<h1>THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF MARIHUANA </h1>

<p><b>Dr. Robert Walton <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b><br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Comments by David Solomon:</b> </p>

<p>In 1937 Dr. Walton, Professor of Pharmacology at the
University of Mississippi, prepared the following scholarly and
comprehensive essay on the medicinal uses of hemp preparations
for his book Marihuana. Sensing that the irrational attitudes
engendered by the marijuana panic then in high gear - might
inhibit legitimate scientific inquiry, he wrote: <br>
</p>

<p>The 1937 Federal legislative acts should be wholly effective
in making these preparations completely unavailable for any
further abuse. More stringent regulations making the drug
unavailable for medical and scientific purposes would be unwise,
since other uses may be developed for the drug which will
completely overshadow its disadvantages. The drug has certain
remarkable properties and if its chemical structure were
determined and synthetic variations developed, some of these
might prove to be particularly valuable, both as therapeutic
agents and as experimental tools. <br>
</p>

<p>Dr. Walton's fears were well grounded: immediately after the
Marihuana Tax Act of 1937t was passed, the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics issued and proceeded to implement 60odd pages of
&quot;more stringent regulations.&quot; These harsh, complex
administrative edicts rendered it virtually impossible - except
in limited instances, characterized by red tape and harassment -
to grow, import, buy, sell, use, prescribe, or experiment with
hemp products. <br>
</p>

<p>The therapeutic application of cannabis is more a matter of
history than of present-day practice. Synthetic analgesics and
hypnotics have almost entirely displaced these preparations from
their original field of application. The newer synthetics are
more effective and reliable and, in addition, have been more
intensely exploited by commercial interests. Cannabis
preparations have come to occupy so minor a place among modern
medicinals that it has been suggested that they be abandoned
altogether, this latter point of view being based on the
assumption that they represent a menace from the standpoint of
the hashish habit. Such an action would certainly be too drastic
in view of the circumstances. For one thing the therapeutic use
of cannabis and the hashish habit are almost entirely unrelated.
The drug has been readily available in this country for almost a
century without developing more than a very occasional, isolated
instance of hashish abuse. The marihuana habit came into this
country by other channels, although it is true that once
established as a practice, some few individuals have made use of
the &quot;drug store&quot; preparations. The 1937 Federal
legislative acts should be wholly effective in making these
preparations completely unavailable for any further abuse of this
sort. More stringent regulations making the drug unavailable for
medical and scientific purposes would be unwise, since other uses
may be developed for the drug which will completely overshadow
its disadvantages. The drug has certain remarkable properties and
if its chemical structure were determined and synthetic
variations developed, some of these might prove to be
particularly valuable, both as therapeutic agents and as
experimental tools. </p>

<p>Essentially the same general opinion has been expressed
recently by the committee on legislative activities of the
American Medical Association. They concluded that there is
positively no evidence to indicate the abuse of cannabis as a
medicinal agent or to show that its medicinal use is leading to
the development of cannabis addiction. Cannabis at the present
time is slightly used for medicinal purposes, but it would seem
worthwhile to maintain its status as a medicinal agent for such
purposes as it now has. There is a possibility that a re-study of
the drug by modern means may show other advantages to be derived
from its medicinal use. <br>
</p>

<p>Although hemp preparations may have been used by the ancients
to produce anesthesia, these drugs were not introduced generally
into medicine until about 1840. At this time O'Shaughnessy,
Aubert-Roche, and Moreau de Tours observed its use in India and
Egypt and proceeded to experiment with its therapeutic
possibilities. After using it in different sorts of conditions,
they were each enthusiastic in representing it as a valuable
therapeutic agent. Their activities resulted in a very widespread
and general use of the drug in both Europe and America. During
the period 1840-1900 there were something over 100 articles
published which recommended cannabis for one disorder or another.
</p>

<p>This popularity of the hemp drugs can be attributed partly to
the fact that they were introduced before the synthetic hypnotics
and analgesics. Chloral hydrate was not introduced until 1869 and
was followed in the next 30 years by paraldehyde, sulfonal, and
the barbitals. Antipyrine and acetanilide, the first of their
particular group of analgesics, were introduced about 1884. For
general sedative and analgesic purposes, the only drugs commonly
used at this time were the morphine derivatives and their
disadvantages were very well known. In fact, the most attractive
feature of the hemp narcotics was probably the fact that they did
not exhibit certain of the notorious disadvantages of the
opiates. The hemp narcotics do not constipate at all, they more
often increase rather than decrease appetite, they do not
particularly depress the respiratory center even in large doses,
they rarely or never cause pruritis or cutaneous eruptions and,
most important, the liability of developing addiction is very
much less than with the opiates. </p>

<p>These features were responsible for the rapid rise in
popularity of the drug. Several features can be recognized as
contributing to the gradual decline of popularity. Cannabis does
not usually produce analgesic or relax spastic conditions with
out producing cortical effects and, in fact, these cortical
effects usually predominate. The actual degree of analgesia
produced is much less than with the opiates. Most important, the
effects are irregular due to marked variations in individual
susceptibility and probably also to variable absorption of the
gummy resin. </p>

<p>The reported therapeutic successes and failures of these drugs
are briefly summarized below. </p>

<p>Among the miscellaneous conditions for which it has been used
and recommended may be mentioned cough, fatigue, rheumatism,
rheumatic neuralgia, asthma, and delirium tremens. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Spastic Conditions </b></p>

<p>Part of the early enthusiasm for cannabis was based on its
presumed value as an antagonist of spastic conditions. It was
used and highly recommended in the treatment of tetanus,
hydrophobia, puerperal convulsions, chorea, and strychnine
poisoning. </p>

<p>In the case of strychnine poisoning, at least, its value is
slight. The author, with the help of Horace Dozier, tested the
influence of cannabis insofar as it affected the minimal
convulsive dose of strychnine in dogs. Even large doses of
cannabis did not alter the strychnine effect enough to indicate
any significant antagonism. In tetanus and hydrophobia,
spasticity is more cerebral in origin and the cannabis antagonism
may have been more effective in such cases. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Analgesic Uses </b></p>

<p>In combatting pain of various causes, cannabis preparations
might be expected to be reasonably effective. See declared that
it &quot;gives relief from pain and increases the appetite in all
cases, no matter on what causes the pain and loss of appetite may
depend.&quot; </p>

<p>Hare says, &quot;. . . during the time that this remarkable
drug is relieving pain, a very curious physical condition
sometimes manifests itself; namely, that the diminution of pain
seems to be due to its fading away in the distance, so that the
pain becomes less and less.&quot; </p>

<p>Mercer says that it does not arrest pain but has a
&quot;special power over spasmodic pain.&quot; Wood says that
&quot;as an analgesic, it is very much inferior to opium but may
be tried when the latter is for any reason contra-indicated. In
full doses, in neuralgic pains, it certainly often gives
relief.&quot; </p>

<p>Aulde says that &quot;as a remedy for the relief of
supraorbital neuralgia no article perhaps affords better
prospects than cannabis.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Headache and Migraine </b></p>

<p>Farlow considered cannabis useful in &quot;nervous
headache.&quot; MacKenzie says that if continued for some time it
is the most valuable remedy he has met with in the treatment of
persistent headache. Marshall does not consider that cannabis is
generally useful but says however that it appears to be useful in
headache of a dull and continuous character. </p>

<p>Regarding migraine, Stevens say that Cannabis indica is
&quot;sometimes very useful.... Two drops of the fluid extract
may be given every half hour until the pain abates or until
slight dizziness or mental confusion appears. Even larger doses
may be used if necessary.&quot; </p>

<p>Osler and McCrea have said that for migraine, Cannabis indica
is probably the most satisfactory remedy. However, in the latest
edition of this text it is only suggested that &quot;a prolonged
course of Cannabis-indica may be tried.&quot; Solis-Cohen and
Githens consider that cannabis is of great service in certain
cases of migraine not dependent upon or aggravated by eyestrain.
Fantus recently recommended its use in migraine, prescribing
doses of 1 cc. of the fluid extract in iso-alcoholic elixir; N.
F. McConnell, Bastedo, Hare, Lewis, and Bragman have also
favorably mentioned its use in migraine. </p>

<p>Beckmann on the other hand says that whereas the drug was once
considered a specific for migraine it has more recently fallen
into &quot;a probably deserved disrepute.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Sedative and Hypnotic Action </b></p>

<p>One of the earlier experimenters with hashish declared that
&quot;in its hypnotic and soothing effects on the nervous system,
its resemblance to morphia is very great.&quot; </p>

<p>Fronmuller made about 1,000 observations on patients in which
the soporific effects were compared with other drugs,
particularly opium. He considered that the effect on the nervous
system was much less dangerous than with opium. In most instances
his patients are stated to have fallen asleep in about an hour
without any particular side effects. </p>

<p>Bastedo remarks that it may promote sleep in the presence of
pain. Poulsson and Dixon say that &quot;sleep has often been seen
to ensue without any, or with only slight excitement.&quot; </p>

<p>Miller, Berthier, McConnell, Shoemaker, Clendinning, Hiller,
and Florshinger have also described its usefulness-in procuring
sleep. Fantus and Cornbleet use it as a general sedative along
with sodium bromide in the treatment of pruritis. Lees was very
enthusiastic about the anodyne and soporific action of an aqueous
extract, which he considered did not produce any of the
excitement effects. </p>

<p>In current practice, the sedative effects are probably most
used in veterinary work. Milks and Eichhorn say that <br>
</p>

<p>cannabis is a distinct depressant to the brain and cord. In
man, this may be preceded by a brief period of stimulation but
this action is rarely seen in the horse. It is a distinct de
pressant and hypnotic and probably ranks ahead of opium for this
purpose in equine practice. After full doses the animals feel
drowsy, sleepy, have a disinclination to move and may finally
pass into a stage of narcosis, which may last from 12 to 24
hours, and then recover. <br>
</p>

<p>One half ounce of the solid extract is cited as being
sufficient to anesthetize a horse. This drug is relatively safe
if considered simply on the basis of its effects on the
circulation and respiratory center. It would seem however that a
very real source of danger exists in the possible development of
bronchopneumonia during the long period of semi-anesthesia. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Mental Conditions </b></p>

<p>Moreau de Tours was the first to advocate using the hashish
euphoria as a means of combatting mental conditions of a
depressive character. He reported a number of case histories of
manics and melancholies which were improved after such therapy.
His conclusions were immediately criticized by Rech. There have
been a few other observations agreeing in general with Moreau de
Tours and there have been some who reported adversely on such
treatment. Straub recently suggested that small doses of a
properly standardized preparation may possibly prove useful in
depressive melancholias. </p>

<p>Edes found it benefited patients who complained of unpleasant,
tiring dreams, and Birch used it in the treatment of chronic
chloral and chronic opium poisoning. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Uterine Dysfunction </b></p>

<p>Some have been particularly enthusiastic regarding the value
of cannabis in dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. Batho says, &quot;.
. . considerable experience of its employment in menorrhagia,
more especially in India, has convinced me that it is, in that
country at all events, one of the most reliable means at our
disposal.&quot; Referring to the use of Indian hemp in
menorrhagia, Brown says, &quot;. . . there is no medicine which
has given such good results; for this reason it ought to take the
first place as a remedy in menorrhagia.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Effects During Labor </b></p>

<p>Willis recommended its use in &quot;tedious labour where the
patient is restless.&quot; Christison used the drug during
childbirth and advocated its use as an oxytocic. He believed it
stimulated uterine movements more quickly than ergot. Kobylanshi,
Grigor and Savignac also reported on its effects during
childbirth. These observations may be taken generally as evidence
that cannabis does not depress uterine movements. The drug is so
lacking in peripheral actions that any special stimulation or
depression would hardly be expected. </p>

<p>The question as to the effects of cannabis during labor was
recently discussed in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. <br>
</p>

<p>The sensation of pain is distinctly lessened or entirely
absent and the sense of touch is less acute than normally. Hence
a woman in labor may have a more or less painless labor. If a
sufficient amount of the drug is taken, the patient may fall into
a tranquil sleep from which she will awaken refreshed. . . . As
far as is known, a baby born of a mother intoxicated with
cannabis will not be abnormal in any way. <br>
</p>

<p>In South Africa the native women smoke cannabis to stupefy
themselves during childbirth. A requisite for the successful use
of this technic would seem to be a previous familiarity with the
effects of the drug. The African natives no doubt use the drug at
other times and accordingly are not as likely to be distressed by
the occasionally terrifying phases of the episode. Also some
experience is needed in order to regulate the dose when used in
this way. In such obstetric use, the drug has one important
advantage as contrasted with morphine, that is, the almost
connplete absence of any depressing effect on the respiratory
mechanism. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Diagnostic Usefulness </b></p>

<p>There have been numerous suggestions that the hashish delirium
may be used in psychiatric analysis as a means of removing the
barriers to the subconscious. This was one of the purportedly
useful features of the drug as declared in the recent legislative
deliberations. Although such an application is not unreasonable,
the few trials which have been made were not particularly
successful. In contrast with cocaine and amytal, the patient
usually becomes more absorbed and less communicative. Lindemann
and Malamud observed this while studying effects in
schizophrenics and psychoneurotic They reported that &quot;new
experiences are created which allow new presentations or new
fantasies and an increasing neglect of the outside world in favor
of experiences which are in keeping with the patient's
desires.&quot; They did note that with schizo phrenics there was
much less change in space and time perception than in
psychoneurotic and normal persons. </p>

<p>There is a fictional account of the use of the drug to obtain
confessions from suspected criminals. In general, however, the
usual effect of the drug is not such as to make it very useful
for such purposes. Von Schrenck described some rather
inconclusive experimentation involving the use of hashish in
hypnotism. <br>

<h1>AN INCIDENT IN KANSAS</h1>

<p><b>An interview with ELVY MUSIKKA and RICHARD DAVIS </b></p>

<p><b>by R Givens c 1995 </b></p>

<p><b>Note to the Reader: </b>Elvy Musikka, interviewed in the
story below is one of only eight people in the United States
legally allowed to use marijuana as medicine. She obtained her
status after being arrested for cultivating marijuana to treat
her glaucoma. Her trial judge ruled that she would be insane
under the circumstances NOT to break the law and that she should
do whatever is required, legal or illegal, to maintain her sight.
She receives a supply of marijuana cigarettes on a regular basis
from the Federal Government. She is also a tireless and quite
vocal activist for the cause of a sensible drug policy toward
sick people. It is in this context that the following incident
occurred. Richard Davis runs the Hemp Museum, a mobile
educational exhibit which demonstrates the history and uses of
hemp. </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>On 21 June 1994 around 7:30pm, RICHARD DAVIS and ELVY MUSIKKA,
a legal marijuana user, were heading west in the Hemp Museum on
I-70 near Salina, Kansas when a Kansas Highway Patrol (KHP) car
began following them. </p>

<p><b>RICHARD DAVIS: </b>He stayed on my tail or came up beside
the truck looking at the stickers for 15 or 20 minutes. When he
stopped me, he said I wasn't driving so good, but he followed me
for a long time and a lot of traffic went by, so he wasn't too
concerned until he decided to stop me. He came over all steamed
up, accusing me, &quot;Look at you. You're all fucked up. Your
eyes are red......&quot; He had an attitude right from the start.
He had me stand behind the truck and went to talk to Elvy. </p>

<p><b>ELVY MUSIKKA: </b>Officer Patrick introduced himself and
said, &quot;I stopped you because your boyfriend has to be
stoned. He's driving 60mph.&quot; It was a 65mph zone and Richard
was driving slower because the wind was blowing the truck around.
A minute later Officer Patrick was telling me that Richard was
being arrested because &quot;He told me that he smoked
marijuana.&quot; (laughs) As though I was fool enough to believe
Richard would ever say something so stupid to a highway
patrolman. (laughs) I knew right then we were dealing with liars.
</p>

<p>As soon as we stopped, I pulled out the Parade Magazine (12
June 1994) with my picture on the cover, so Officer Patrick and
the rest of them knew from the very beginning that I receive
LEGAL MARIJUANA from the government. He asked what the maximum I
can carry is and I told him I can have a three-month supply,
which is a lot, because I'm expected to smoke 300 joints a month.
Then Officer Patrick wanted to check my pouch, so I showed him my
prescription bottle. He smelled the weed and said it smelled very
good. He thought it was too good to be government pot. I guess he
had read enough to know that the government only gives out trash.
He wondered about them being hand-rolled, but the government
marijuana is freeze dried and I have to wet it and re-roll it
because it's too harsh. </p>

<p>Officer Patrick never questioned that I was a legal smoker,
but he was determined to arrest Richard no matter what. He was
upset because Richard chose to exercise his 1st Amendment Rights
with his bumper stickers and the hemp plant on top of the truck.
Cops like Officer Patrick think they are above the law. This was
proven by the way they harassed us for the next five hours. </p>

<p><b>RICHARD DAVIS:</b> Within 20 minutes four squad cars were
there. Patrick started out threatening me with jail and they kept
asking for consent to search the back of the truck. Every once in
a while they would come over in a group and seriously discuss
getting permission to search. They asked several times, but I
refused. They said they were going to take me to jail anyway.
Officer Patrick was convinced that he was going to get in the
back and nail me for 200 pounds of weed he seemed to think I had
in there. (laughs) They kept saying, &quot;Let us take a look. If
it's only a little bit for personal use, we don't care.&quot;
They hinted that they would just take the weed and let us go, but
they weren't giving any guarantees. They finally decided to get a
drug dog. If the dog got a positive response for marijuana, that
would be their probable cause. </p>

<p><b>ELVY MUSIKKA:</b> (laughs hard) There I was dressed in
HEMP, we are driving a HEMP museum, they already know I'm a LEGAL
MARIJUANA USER (laughs), and they needed a drug dog to determine
there was some HEMP there. (laughs) As soon as the dog arrived,
it was time for my medicine, so I lit up and smoked a whole
joint. By then we had been detained four hours. </p>

<p><b>RICHARD DAVIS:</b> We told them over and over that we would
not approve a search. They knew full well that they were doing an
ILLEGAL SEARCH. Elvy even asked if they had a warrant signed by a
judge. Their answer was &quot;No, but we can get one.&quot; They
never did though. </p>

<p>We were a couple of hours into this before Officer Patrick
snapped and read me my rights. He said I had the right to remain
silent, so I shut up. Until then I was very cooperative and tried
to educate them about hemp. All they did was threaten me with
jail and constantly ask to search the truck. </p>

<p>After they got the dog they decide they could search the back
of the truck. They thought I had the keys even though they patted
me down right after they stopped us. One of the troopers took a
one bladed swiss army type knife the Hemp Rope People gave me. I
guess he liked the knife until he found out I wasn't going to
jail. We had to wait an extra hour while the officer brought the
knife back. Anyway, the keys were in the ignition, so they got in
without breaking the lock. </p>

<p>Once they got in back, they went through Elvy's stuff and
found a half pound of good bud and some very good leaf a dealer
GAVE her because the government shorted Elvy a month's supply on
her prescription. When they found that they said, &quot;we've got
him on sales!&quot; </p>

<p><b>ELVY MUSIKKA:</b> They were in MY suitcase threatening
Richard with &quot;sales.&quot; My suitcase was totally locked.
They destroyed the zipper and went through ALL of my personal
belongings. It was a violation of my privacy in every way. </p>

<p>They were opening sealed containers and poking through
EVERYTHING. They had the audacity to open my government marijuana
can, which was sealed exactly the way I get it. I purposely keep
it sealed so if anybody gets in there it has to be an ILLEGAL
SEARCH. </p>

<p>I had a few government joints on top and some good bud and
some very good leaf for baking. I like cookies because of the
hassle of smoking on the road. Anyway, according to the court
order of Judge Markey Bolin, I am entitled to do WHATEVER it
takes LEGAL or ILLEGAL to preserve my sight. That's in the
Judge's decision. </p>

<p>They took the good marijuana and left me a few days supply of
government trash. they even stole my government prescription
marijuana container. Officer Patrick and the rest of them may be
interested to know that they definitely put my vision at risk by
stealing my medicine. I have a tolerance to the standard glaucoma
medicines and if my doctor hadn't arranged an emergency shipment,
I would have been in real trouble. The stuff the troopers left
only lasted a few days. </p>

<p><b>RICHARD DAVIS:</b> Now, let's get this straight. Elvy had
that bud because she was shorted a month's supply by the
government. THEY admitted as much when they Federal Expressed 300
joints to a Motel 6. Those highway patrolmen weren't satisfied
with harassing us for five hours in the middle of the night; they
had to take a glaucoma patient's medicine before they were happy.
</p>

<p>I feel sorry for people like Officer Patrick because this War
on Drugs completely compromises their morality. It absolutely
destroys their integrity going around lying and abusing citizens
rights. I would be amazed if all the pot they took ended up in
the DA's office. The property receipt they gave us was so
illegible that it says absolutely nothing about what they took.
You can't read a word. Maybe that's their idea of honesty. </p>

<p>They know damn well that marijuana isn't dangerous. At no time
did these cops act as though they thought we were a threat. They
never handcuffed me and they left me alone several times while
they badgered Elvy. They thanked us over and over for being so
courteous. After being detained for five hours and being robbed
by a gang of thieves with badges, all they did was give me a
warning citation for a cracked windshield that doesn't require
any action. </p>

<p>They took over a half pound of marijuana, but they never
arrested ANYBODY for ANYTHING. How can they do that??? </p>

<p>They broke a bunch of stuff in the Hemp Museum during their
search. They offered to put everything back, but they made it
pretty clear that they would wreck everything they could if they
had to clean up their own mess. So I stood out there in the
middle of the night trying to get everything back in the truck. </p>

<p><b>ELVY MUSIKKA:</b> Officer Patrick and the other highway
patrolmen might be interested to know that they made me feel like
I was in some foreign police state where you don't have any
rights. Those troopers made me feel I was in a very different
country than the one where I took an oath to defend and uphold
the Constitution. I became a citizen by choice, not chance, and I
know my rights. Seeing these Kansas highway patrolmen trample on
the Constitution made me feel very bad. They knew our rights, but
they didn't care if they violated them. Officer Patrick and the
rest of them knew right from the beginning that I have a legal
right to have marijuana, but they didn't let that stop them. I'm
considering a civil rights suit.<br>

<h3><a name="Exec_summ">Executive summary <br>
</a></h3>

<p>The following is a summary of the major adverse health and
psychological effects of acute and chronic cannabis use, grouped
according to the degree of confidence in the view that the
relationship between cannabis use and the adverse effect is a
causal one. <br>
</p>

<h4><a name="acute">Acute effects</a> </h4>

<p>anxiety, dysphoria, panic and paranoia, especially in naive
users; <br>
cognitive impairment, especially of attention and memory, for the
duration of intoxication; <br>
psychomotor impairment, and probably an increased risk of
accident if an intoxicated person attempts to drive a motor
vehicle, or operate machinery; <br>
an increased risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms among those
who are vulnerable because of personal or family history of
psychosis; <br>
an increased risk of low birth weight babies if cannabis is used
during pregnancy. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="chronic">Chronic effects</a> </h4>

<p>The major health and psychological effects of chronic heavy
cannabis use, especially daily use over many years, remain
uncertain. On the available evidence, the major probable adverse
effects appear to be: </p>

<p>respiratory diseases associated with smoking as the method of
administration, such as chronic bronchitis, and the occurrence of
histopathological changes that may be precursors to the
development of malignancy. <br>
development of a cannabis dependence syndrome, characterised by
an inability to abstain from or to control cannabis use; <br>
subtle forms of cognitive impairment, most particularly of
attention and memory, which persist while the user remains
chronically intoxicated, and may or may not be reversible after
prolonged abstinence from cannabis. </p>

<p>The following are the major possible adverse effects of
chronic, heavy cannabis use which remain to be confirmed by
further research: </p>

<p>an increased risk of developing cancers of the aerodigestive
tract, i.e. oral cavity, pharynx, and oesophagus; <br>
an increased risk of leukemia among offspring exposed while in
utero; <br>
a decline in occupational performance marked by underachievement
in adults in occupations requiring high level cognitive skills,
and impaired educational attainment in adolescents; <br>
birth defects occurring among children of women who used cannabis
during their pregnancies. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="high">High risk groups</a> <br>
<br>
<br>
</h4>

<h4><a name="adolescents">Adolescents</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Adolescents with a history of poor school performance may have
their educational achievement further limited by the cognitive
impairments produced by chronic intoxication with cannabis. <br>
Adolescents who initiate cannabis use in the early teens are at
higher risk of progressing to heavy cannabis use and other
illicit drug use, and to the development of dependence on
cannabis. <br>
<br>
Women of childbearing age <br>
Pregnant women who continue to smoke cannabis are probably at
increased risk of giving birth to low birth weight babies, and
perhaps of shortening their period of gestation. <br>
Women of childbearing age who smoke cannabis at the time of
conception or while pregnant possibly increase the risk of their
children being born with birth defects. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="persons">Persons with pre-existing diseases</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Persons with a number of pre-existing diseases who smoke
cannabis are probably at an increased risk of precipitating or
exacerbating symptoms of their diseases. These include: <br>
individuals with cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery
disease, cerebrovascular disease and hypertension; <br>
individuals with respiratory diseases, such as asthma,
bronchitis, and emphysema; <br>
individuals with schizophrenia, who are at increased risk of
precipitating or of exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms; <br>
individuals who are dependent on alcohol and other drugs, who are
probably at an increased risk of developing dependence on
cannabis. </p>

<p>The health risks of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use </p>

<h4><a name="acute_effects">Acute effects</a></h4>

<p>Alcohol. The major risks of acute cannabis use are similar to
the acute risks of alcohol intoxication in a number of respects.
First, both drugs produce psychomotor and cognitive impairment.
The impairment produced by alcohol increases risks of various
kinds of accident. It remains to be determined whether cannabis
intoxication produces similar increases in accidental injury and
death, although on balance it probably does. Second, substantial
doses of alcohol taken during the first trimester of pregnancy
can produce a foetal alcohol syndrome. There is suggestive but
far from conclusive evidence that cannabis used during pregnancy
may have similar adverse effects. Third, there is a major health
risk of acute alcohol use that is not shared with cannabis. In
large doses alcohol can cause death by asphyxiation, alcohol
poisoning, cardiomyopathy and cardiac infarct whereas there are
no recorded cases of fatalities attributable to cannabis. </p>

<p>Tobacco. The major acute health risks that cannabis share with
tobacco are the irritant effects of smoke upon the respiratory
system, and the stimulating effects of both THC and nicotine on
the cardiovascular system, both of which can be detrimental to
persons with cardiovascular disease. <br>
<br>
</p>

<h4><a name="chronic_effects">Chronic effects</a> <br>
</h4>

<p>Alcohol. Chronic cannabis use may share some of the risks of
heavy chronic alcohol use. First, heavy use of either drug
increases the risk of developing a dependence syndrome in which
users experience difficulty in stopping or controlling their use.
There is strong evidence for such a syndrome in the case of
alcohol and reasonable evidence in the case of cannabis. Second,
there is reasonable clinical evidence that the chronic heavy use
of alcohol can produce psychotic symptoms and psychoses in some
individuals. There is suggestive evidence that chronic heavy
cannabis use may produce a toxic psychosis, precipitate psychotic
illnesses in predisposed individuals, and exacerbate psychotic
symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. Third, there is good
evidence that chronic heavy alcohol use can indirectly cause
brain injury - the Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome - with symptoms of
severe memory defect and an impaired ability to plan and
organise. Chronic cannabis use does not produce cognitive
impairment of comparable severity but there is suggestive
evidence that chronic cannabis use may produce subtle defects in
cognitive functioning, that may or may not be reversible after
abstinence. Fourth, there is reasonable evidence that chronic
heavy alcohol use produces impaired occupational performance in
adults and lowered educational achievements in adolescents. There
is at most suggestive evidence that chronic heavy cannabis use
produces similar, albeit more subtle impairments in occupational
and educational performance of adults. Fifth, there is good
evidence that chronic, heavy alcohol use increases the risk of
premature mortality from accidents, suicide and violence. There
is no comparable evidence for chronic cannabis use, although it
is likely that dependent cannabis users who frequently drive
while intoxicated with cannabis increase their risk of accidental
injury or death. Sixth, alcohol use has been accepted as a
contributory cause of cancer of the oropharangeal organs in men
and women. There is suggestive evidence that chronic cannabis
smoking may also be a contributory cause of cancers of the
aerodigestive tract (i.e. the mouth, tongue, throat, oesophagus,
lungs). <br>
Tobacco. The major adverse health effects shared by chronic
cannabis and tobacco smokers are chronic respiratory diseases,
such as chronic bronchitis, and probably, cancers of the
aerodigestive tract. The increased risk of cancer in the
respiratory tract is a consequence of the shared route of
administration by smoking. It is possible that chronic cannabis
smoking also shares the cardiotoxic properties of tobacco
smoking, although this possibility remains to be investigated. <br>

<h1>MARINOL</h1>

<p>(dronabinol*) </p>

<p>Capsules </p>

<p>(Warning: May be habit forming) </p>

<p>The USAN name for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Dronabinol is a cannabinoid designated chemically as
(6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-l-ol.
Dronabinol has the following empirical and structural formulas: <br>
</p>

<p><img src="structur.gif" width="330" height="159" [chemical
structure]><br>
</p>

<p>Dronabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), is
naturally-occurring and has been extracted from Cannabis saliva
L. (marijuana). </p>

<p>Dronabinol is also chemically synthesized and is a
light-yellow resinous oil that is sticky at room temperature and
hardens upon refrigeration. </p>

<p>Dronabinol is insoluble in water and is formulated in sesame
oil. It has a pKa of 10.6 and an octanol-water partition
coefficient: 6,000:1 at pH 7. </p>

<p>Capsules for oral administration: Marinol is supplied as
round, soft gelatin capsules containing either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 1
0 mg dronabinol. Each Marinol capsule is formulated with the
following inactive ingredients: </p>

<p>sesame oil, gelatin, glycerin, methylparaben, propylparaben,
and titanium dioxide.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>Dronabinol is an orally active cannabinoid which, like other
cannabinoids, has complex effects on the central nervous system
(CNS), including central sympathomimetic activity. Cannabinoid
receptors have been discovered in neural tissues. These receptors
may play a role in mediating the effects of dronabinol and other
cannabinoids. <br>
</p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics: Dronabinol-induced sympathomimetic activity
may result in tachycardia and/or conjunctival injection. Its
effects on blood pressure are inconsistent, but occasional
subjects have experienced orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope
upon abrupt standing. </p>

<p>Dronabinol also demonstrates reversible effects on appetite,
mood, cognition, memory, and perception. These phenomena appear
to be dose-related, increasing in frequency with higher dosages,
and subject to great interpatient variability </p>

<p>After oral administration, dronabinol has an onset of action
of approximately 0.5 to 1 hours and peak effect at 2 to 4 hours.
Duration of action for psychoactive effects is 4 to 6 hours, but
the appetite stimulant effect of dronabinol may continue for 24
hours or longer after administration. </p>

<p>Tachyphylaxis and tolerance develop to some of the
pharmacologic effects of dronabinol and other cannabinoids wth
chronic use, suggesting an indirect effect on sympathetic
neurons. In a study of the pharmacodynamics of chronic dronabinol
exposure, healthy male volunteers (N = 12) received 210 mg/day
dronabinol, administered orally in divided doses, for 16 days. An
initial tachycardia induced by dronabinoi was replaced
successively by normal sinus rhythm and then bradycardia. A
decrease in supine blood pressure, made worse by standing, was
also observed initially. These volunteers developed tolerance to
the cardiovascular and subjective adverse CNS effects of
dronabinol within 12 days of treatment initiation. </p>

<p>Tachyphylaxis and tolerance do not, however, appear to develop
to the appetite stimulant effect of Marinol. In studies involving
patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the
appetite stimulant effect of Marinol has been sustained for up to
five months in clinical trials, at dosages ranging from 2.5
mg/day to 20 mg/day.<br>
</p>

<p>Pharmacokinetics: </p>

<p>Absorption and Distribution: Marinol (dronabinol) is almost
completely absorbed (90 to 95%) after single oral doses. Due to
the combined effects of first pass hepatic metabolism and high
lipid solubility, only 10 to 20% of the administered dose reaches
the systemic circulation. Dronabinol has a large apparent volume
of distribution, approximately 10 L/kg, because of its lipid
solubility. The plasma protein binding of dronabinol and its
metabolites is approximately 97%. </p>

<p>The elimination phase of dronabinol can be described using a
two compartment model with an initial (alpha) half-life of about
4 hours and a terminal (beta) half-life of 25 to 36 hours.
Because of its large volume of distribution, dronabinol and its
metabolites may be excreted at low levels for prolonged periods
of time.<br>
</p>

<p>Metabolism: Dronabinol undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic
metabolism, primarily by icrosomal hydroxylation, yielding both
active and inactive metabolites. Dronabinol and its principal
active metabolite, 11-OH-delta-9-THC, are present in
approximately equal concentrations in plasma. Concentrations of
both parent drug and metaboiite peak at approximately 2 to 4
hours after oral dosing and decline over several days. </p>

<p>Values to clearance average about 0.2 L/kg-hr, but are highly
variable due to the complexity of cannabinoid distribution. </p>

<p>Elimination: Dronabinol and its biotransformation products are
excreted in both feces and urine. Biliary excretion is the major
route of elimination with about half of a radiolabeled oral dose
being recovered from the feces within 72 hours as contrasted with
10 to 15% recovered from urine. Less than 5% of an oral dose is
recovered unchanged in the feces. </p>

<p>Following single dose administration, low levels of dronabinol
metabolites have been detected for more than 5 weeks in the urine
and feces. </p>

<p>In a study of Marinol involving AIDS patients, urinary
cannabinoid/creatinine concentration ratios were studied biweekly
over a six week period. The urinary cannabinoid/creatinine ratio
was closely correlated with dose. No increase in the
cannabinoid/creatinine ratio was observed after the first two
weeks of treatment, indicating that steady-state cannabinoid
levels had been reached. This conclusion is consistent with
predictions based on the observed terminal half-life of
dronabinol. </p>

<p>Special Populations: The pharmacokinetic profile of Marinol
has not been investigated in either pediatric or geriatric
patients. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p>CLINICAL TRIALS </p>

<p>Appetite Stimulation: The appetite stimulant effect of Marinol
(dronabinol) in the treatment of AIDS-related anorexia associated
with weight loss was studied in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study involving 139 patients. The initial
dosage of Marinol in all patients was 5 mg/day, administered in
doses of 2.5 mg one hour before lunch and one hour before supper.
In pilot studies, early morning administration of Marinol
appeared to have been associated with an increased frequency of
adverse experiences, as compared to dosing later in the day. The
effect of Marinol on appetite, weight, mood, and nausea was
measured at scheduled intervals during the six-week treatment
period. Side effects (feeling high, dizziness, confusion,
somnolence) occurred in 13 of 72 patients (18%) at this dosage
level and the dosage was reduced to 2.5 mg/day, administered as a
single dose at supper or bedtime. </p>

<p>As compared to placebo, Marinol treatment resulted in a
statistically significant improvement in appetite as measured by
visual analog scale (see figure). Trends toward improved body
weight and mood, and decreases in nausea were also seen. </p>

<p>After completing the 6-week study, patients were allowed to
continue treatment with Marinol in an open-label study, in which
there was a sustained improvement in appetite.<br>
</p>

<p><img src="figure.gif" width="368" height="247" [figure]><br>
</p>

<p>Antiemetic: Marinol (dronabinol) treatment
ofchemotherapy-induced emesis was evaluated in 454 patients with
cancer, who received a total of 750 courses of treatment of
various malignancies. The antiemetic efficacy of Marinol was
greatest in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy with MOPP for
Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Marinol dosages ranged
from 2.5 mg/day to 4O mg/day administered in equally divided
doses every four to six hours(four times daily). As indicated in
the following table, escalating the Marinol dose above 7 mg/m2
increased the frequency of adverse experiences, with no
additional antiemetic benefit. </p>

</p>

<p>Combination antiemetic therapy with Marinol and a
phenothiazine (prochlorperazine) may result in synergistic or
additive antiemetic effects and attenuate the toxicities
associated with each of the agents.<br>
</p>

<p>INDIVIDUALIZATION OF DOSAGES </p>

<p>The pharmacologic effects of Marinol (dronabinol) are
dose-related and subject to considerable interpatient
variability. Therefore, dosage individualization is critical in
achieving the maximum benefit of Marinol treatment. </p>

<p>Appetite Stimulation: In the clinical trials, the majority of
patients were treated with 5 mg/day Marinol, although the dosages
ranged from 2.5 to 20 mg/day. For an adult:<br>
</p>

<p>1. Begin with 2.5 mg before lunch and 2.5 mg before supper. If
CNS symptoms (feeling high, dizziness, confusion, somnolence) do
occur, they usually resolve in 1 to 3 days with continued dosage.
</p>

<p>2. If CNS symptoms are severe or persistent, reduce the dose
to 2.5 mg before supper. if symptoms continue to be a problem,
taking the single dose in the evening or at bedtime may reduce
their severity. </p>

<p>3. When adverse effects are absent or minimal and further
therapeutic affect is desired, increase the dose to 2.5 mg before
lunch and 5 mg before supper or 5 and 5 mg. Although most
patients respond to 2.5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily has
been tolerated in about half of the patients in appetite
stimulation studies. </p>

<p>The pharmacologic effects of Marinol are reversible upon
treatment cessation. </p>

<p>Antiemetic: Most patients respond to 5 mg three or four times
daily. Dosage may be escalated during a chemotherapy cycle or at
subsequent cycles, based upon initial results. Therapy should be
initiated at the lowest recommended dosage and titrated to
clinical response. Administration of Marinol with phenothiazines,
such as prochlorperazine, has resulted in improved efficacy as
compared to either drug alone, without additional toxicity. </p>

<p>Pediatrics: Marinol is not recommended for AIDS-related
anorexia in pediatric patients because it has not been studied in
this population. The pediatric dosage for the treatment of
chemotherapy-induced emesis is the same as in adults. Caution is
recommended in prescribing Marinol for children because of the
psychoactive effects. </p>

<p>Geriatrics: Caution is advised in prescribing Marinol in
elderly patients because they are generally more sensitive to the
psychoactive effects of drugs. In antiemetic studies, no
difference in tolerance or efficacy was apparent in patients &gt;
55 years old. </p>

<p>INDICATIONS AND USAGE<br>
</p>

<p>Marinol (dronabinol) is indicated for the treatment of: </p>

<ol>
    <li>anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with
        AIDS; and </li>
    <li>nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy
        in patients who have failed to respond adequately to
        conventional antiemetic treatments.<br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>CONTRAINDICATIONS </p>

<p>Marinol (dronabinol) is contraindicated in any patient who has
a history of hypersensitivity to any cannabinoid or sesame oil. </p>

<p>WARNINGS </p>

<p>Marinol (dronabinol) is a medication with a potential for
abuse. Physicians and pharmacists should use the same care in
prescribing and accounting for Marinol as they would with
morphine or other drugs controlled under Schedule II (CII) of the
Controlled Substances Act. </p>

<p>Because of the risk of diversion, it is recommended that
prescriptions be limited to the amount necessary for the period
between clinic visits. </p>

<p>Patients receiving treatment with Marinol should be
specifically warned not to drive, operate machinery, or engage in
any hazardous activity until it is established that they are able
to tolerate the drug and to perform such tasks safely.<br>
</p>

<p>PRECAUTIONS </p>

<p>General: The risk/benefit ratio of Marinol (dronabinol) use
should be carefully evaluated in patients with the following
medical conditions because of individual variation in response
and tolerance to the effects of Marinol. </p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution in patients with cardiac
disorders because of occasional hypotension, possible
hypertension, syncope, or tachycardia (see CLINICAL
PNARMACOLOGY).<br>
</p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution in patients with a history
of substance abuse, including alcohol abuse or dependence,
because they may be more prone to abuse Marinol as well. Multiple
substance abuse is common and marijuana, which contains the same
active compound, is a frequently abused substance. </p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution and careful psychiatric
monitoring in patients with mania, depression, or schizophrenia
because Marinol may exacerbate these illnesses. </p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution in patients receiving
concomitant therapy with sedatives, hypnotics or other
psychoactive drugs because of the potential for additive or
synergistic CNS effects. </p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution in pregnant patients,
nursing mothers, or pediatric patients because it has not been
studied in these patient populations. </p>

<p>Marinol should be used with caution for treatment of anorexia
and weight loss in elderly patients with AIDS because they may be
more sensitive to the psychoactive effects and because its use in
these patients has not been studied. </p>

<p>Information for Patients: Patients receiving treatment with
Marinol (dronabinol) should be alerted to the potential for
additive central nervous system depression if Marinol is used
concomitantly with alcohol or other CNS depressants such as
benzodiazepines and barbiturates. </p>

<p>Patients receiving treatment with Marinol should be
specifically warned not to drive, operate machinery, or engage in
any hazardous activity until it is established that they are able
to tolerate the drug and to perform such tasks safely. </p>

<p>Patients using Marinol should be advised of possible changes
in mood and other adverse behavioral effects of the drug so as to
avoid panic in the event of such manifestations. Patients should
remain under the supervision of a responsible adult during
initial use of Marinol and following dosage adjustments. </p>

<p>Drug Interactions: In studies involving patients with AIDS
and/or cancer, Marinol (dronabinol) has been co-administered with
a variety of medications (e.g., cytotoxic agents, anti-infective
agents, sedatives, or opioid analgesics) without resulting in any
clinically significant drug/drug interactions. Although no
drug/drug interactions were discovered during the clinical trials
of Marinol, cannabinoids may interact with other medications
through both metabolic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms. </p>

<p>Dronabinol is highly protein bound to plasma proteins, and
therefore, might displace other protein-bound drugs. Although
this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo, practitioners
should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when
administering dronabinol to patients receiving other highly
protein-bound drugs. Published reports of drug/drug interactions
involving cannabinoids are summarized in the following table.<br>

<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dronabinol.
Mutagenicity testing was negative in an Ames test. In a long-term
study (77 days) in rats, oral administration of dronabinol at
doses of 30 to 150 mg/m2 , equivalent to 0.3 to 1.5 times maximum
recommended human dose (MRHD) of 90 mg/m2/day in cancer patients
or 2 to 10 times MRHD of 15 mg/m2/day in AIDS patients, reduced
ventral prostate, seminal vesicle and epididymal weights and
caused a decrease in seminal fluid volume. Decreases in
spermatogenesis, number of developing germ cells, and number of
Leydig cells in the testis were also observed. However, sperm
count, mating success and testosterone levels were not affected.
The significance of these animal findings in humans is not known.
</p>

<p>Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies with
dronabinol have been performed in mice at 15 to 450 mg/m2
equivalent to 0.2 to 5 times maximum recommended human dose
(MRHD) of 90 mg/m2/day in cancer patients or 1 to 30 times MRHD
of 15 mg/m2/day in AIDS patients, and in rats at 74 to 295 mg/m2
(equivalent to 0.8 to 3 times m of 90 mg/m2 in cancer patients or
5 to 20 times MRHD of 15 mg/m2/day in AIDS patients). These
studies have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to
dronabinol. At these dosages in mice and rats, dronabinol
decreased maternal weight gain and number of viable pups and
increased fetal mortality and early resorptions. Such effects
were dose dependent and less apparent at lower doses which
produced less maternal toxicity. There are no adequate and
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Dronabinol should be
used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk
to the fetus. </p>

<p>Nursing Mothers: Use of Marinol is not recommended in nursing
mothers since, in addition to the secretion of HIV virus in
breast milk, dronabinol is concentrated in and secreted in human
breast milk and is absorbed by the nursing baby. </p>

<p>ADVERSE REACTIONS </p>

<p>Adverse experiences information summarized in the tables below
was derived from well-controlled clinical trials conducted in the
US and US territories involving 474 patients exposed to Marinol
(dronabinol). Studies of AIDS-related weight loss included 157
patients receiving dronabinol at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and
67 receiving placebo. Studies of different durations were
combined by considering the first occurrence of events during the
first 28 days. Studies of nausea and vomiting related to cancer
chemotherapy included 317 patients receiving dronabinol and 68
receiving placebo. </p>

<p><img src="table2.gif" width="459" height="394"> </p>

<p>A cannabinoid dose-related &quot;high&quot; (easy laughing,
elation and heightened awareness) has been reported by patients
receiving Marinol in both the antiemetic (24%) and the lower dose
appetite stimulant clinical trials (8%) (see CLINICAL TRIALS). </p>

<p>The most frequently reported adverse experiences in patients
with AIDS during placebo-controlled clinical trials involved the
CNS and were reported by 33% of patients receiving Marinol. About
25% of patients reported a minor CNS adverse event during the
first 2 weeks and about 4% reported such an event each week for
the next 6 weeks thereafter. </p>

<p>PROBABLY CAUSALLY RELATED: Incidence greater than 1%. Rates
derived from clinical trials in AIDS-related anorexia (N = 157)
and chemotherapy-related nausea (N = 317). Rates were generally
higher in the antiemetic use (given in parentheses). </p>

<p>Body as a whole: Asthenia. </p>

<p>Cardiovascular: Palpitations, tachycardia, vasodilation/facial
flush. </p>

<p>Digestive: Abdominal pain*, nausea*, vomiting*. </p>

<p>Nervous system: (Amnesia), anxiety/nervousness, (ataxia),
confusion, depersonalization, dizziness*, euphoria*,
(hallucination), paranoid reaction*, somnolence*, thinking
abnormal*. </p>

<p>*Incidence of events 3% to 10% </p>

<p>PROBABLY CAUSALLY RELATED: Incidence less than 1%. </p>

<p>Skin and Appendages: Sweating.<br>
</p>

<p>DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE </p>

<p>Marinol (dronabinol) is one of the psychoactive compounds
present in cannabis, and is abusable and controlled Schedule II
(CII) under the Controlled Substances Act. Both psychological and
physiological dependence have been noted in healthy individuals
receiving dronabinol, but addiction is uncommon and has only been
seen after prolonged high dose administration. </p>

<p>Chronic abuse of cannabis has been associated with decrements
in motivation, cognition, judgement, and perception. The etiology
of these impairments is unknown, but may be associated with the
complex process of addiction rather than an isolated effect of
the drug. No such decrements in psychological, social or
neurological status have been associated with the administration
of Marinol for therapeutic purposes. </p>

<p>In an open-label study in patients with AIDS who received
Marinol for up to five months, no abuse, diversion or systematic
change in personality or social functioning were observed despite
the inclusion of a substantial number of patients with a past
history of drug abuse. </p>

<p>An abstinence syndrome has been reported after the abrupt
discontinuation of dronabinol in volunteers receiving dosages of
210 mg/day for 12 to 16 consecutive days. Within 12 hours after
discontinuation, these volunteers manifested symptoms such as
irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. By approximately 24
hours post-dronabinol discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms
intensified to include &quot;hot flashes&quot;, sweating,
rhinorrhea, loose stools, hiccoughs and anorexia. </p>

<p>These withdrawal symptoms gradually dissipated over the next
48 hours. Electroencephalographic changes consistent with the
effects of drug withdrawal (hyperexcitation) were recorded in
patients after abrupt dechallenge. Patients also complained of
disturbed sleep for several weeks after discontinuing therapy
with high dosages of dronabinol. </p>

<p>OVERDOSAGE </p>

<p>Signs and symptoms following MILD Marinol (dronabinol)
intoxication include drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory
awareness, altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry
mouth and tachycardia; following MODERATE intoxication include
memory impairment, depersonalization, mood alteration, urinary
retention, and reduced bowel motility; and following SEVERE
intoxication include decreased motor coordination, lethargy,
slurred speech, and postural hypotension. Apprehensive patients
may experience panic reactions and seizures may occur in patients
with existing seizure disorders. </p>

<p>The estimated lethal human dose of intravenous dronabinol is
30 mg/kg (2100 mg/70 kg). Significant CNS symptoms in antiemetic
studies followed oral doses of 0.4 mg/kg (28 mg/70 kg) of
Marinol. </p>

<p>Management: A potentially serious oral ingestion, if recent,
should be managed with gut decontamination. In unconscious
patients with a secure airway, instill activated charcoal (30 to
100 g in adults, 1 to 2 g/kg in infants) via a nasogastric tube.
A saline cathartic or sorbitol may be added to the first dose of
activated charcoal. Patients experiencing depressive,
hallucinatory or psychotic reactions should be placed in a quiet
area and offered reassurance. Benzodiazepines (5 to 10 mg
diazepam po) may be used for treatment of extreme agitation.
Hypotension usually responds to Trendelenburg position and IV
fluids. Pressors are rarely required.<br>
</p>

<p>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION </p>

<p>Appetite stimulation: Initially, 2.5 mg Marinol (dronabinol)
should be administered orally twice daily (b.i.d.), before lunch
and supper. For patients unable to tolerate this 5 mg/day dosage
of Marinol, the dosage can be reduced to 2.5 mg/day, administered
as a single dose in the evening or at bedtime. If clinically
indicated and in the absence of significant adverse effects, the
dosage may be gradually increased to a maximum of 20 mg/day
Marinol, administered in divided oral doses. Caution should be
exercised in escalating the dosage of Marinol because of the
increased frequency of dose-related adverse experiences at higher
dosages (see PRECAUTIONS). </p>

<p>Antiemetic: Marinol is best administered at an initial dose of
5 mg/m2, given 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration of
chemotherapy, then every 2 to 4 hours after chemotherapy is
given, for a total of 4 to 6 doses/day. Should the 5 mg/m2 dose
prove to be ineffective, and in the absence of significant side
effects, the dose may be escalated by 2.5 mg/m2 increments to a
maximum of 15 mg/m2 per dose. Caution should be exercised in dose
escalation, however, as the incidence of disturbing psychiatric
symptoms increases significantly at maximum dose (see
PRECAUTIONS). <br>
</p>

<p>SAFETY AND HANDLING </p>

<p>Marinol (dronabinol) should be packaged in a well-closed
container and stored in a cool environment between 8' and 15'C
(46' and 59'F). Protect from freezing. No particular hazard to
health care workers handling the capsules has been identified. </p>

<p>Access to abusable drugs such as Marinol presents an
occupational hazard for addiction in the health care industry.
Routine procedures for handling controlled substances developed
to protect the public may not be adequate to protect health care
workers. Implementation of more effective accounting procedures
and measures to appropriately restrict access to drugs of this
class may minimize the risk of self-administration by health care
providers.<br>

<title>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</title>

<h1><center>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</center> </h1>

<hr>

<p> In April 1994, hemp activists in Breckenridge put an
initiative on their local ballot that directed the local law
enforcement to make it their lowest priority to arrest someone
for using marijuana for medicine. The initiative passed by about
50 votes. (The initiative was modeled after San Francisco's
Proposition P which passed by over 80% of the votes.) Shortly
after the Breckenridge initiative passed, the Frisco city council
adopted a similar ordinance encouraging medical marijuana
research. So now there are two towns in Summit County that have
medical marijuana ordinances. Way to go, Summit County
activists!!! </p>

<p> From: &quot;MARY E. PATTERSON&quot; <a
href="mailto:71672.1304@compuserve.com">email
71672.1304@compuserve.com</a> </p>

<p> Here's the Breckenridge ordinance, which passed by a people's
vote. </p>

<p> The problems we had were in copying the Denver Medical MJ
Ordinance too closly. We should have researched more carefully
the chain of command in the town of Breck. It's not the mayor,
but the town manager, who tells the police chief what to do. </p>

<p> Mary :) </p>

<hr>

<h2><center>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</center> </h2>

<p> ORDERING THE MAYOR TO DIRECT THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO MAKE THEIR LOWEST PRIORITY THE ARREST OR
PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE POSSESSION OR CULTIVATION OF
MARIJUANA FOR PERSONAL USE FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES, AND FOR THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO ALLOW A LETTER FROM A TREATING PHYSICIAN TO
BE USED A PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE THAT MARIJUANA CAN ALLEVIATE THE
PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THAT PATIENT'S MEDICAL CONDITION, AND
INSTRUCTING THE TOWN'S REPRESENTATIVE TO LOBBY THE STATE
LEGISLATURE FOR A STATE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL. </p>

<p> WHEREAS, the Colorado State Legislature held hearings and
approved the medicinal use of marijuana (HB 1042; Colorado
Revised Statute 25-5-901-907); and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, &quot;hemp medical preparations&quot; are defined as
all products made from hemp, cannabis, or marijuana that are
intended for the treatment of disease, the relief of pain, or for
any healing purpose; and WHEREAS, &quot;medicinal purposes,&quot;
for the purpose of this ordinance, would include, but not be
limited to, the treatment of AIDS, glaucoma, cancer, multiple
sclerosis, arthritis, rheumatism, severe muscle spasm, epilepsy,
asthma, as well as other serious illnesses or pain; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, hemp preparations have been used for thousands of
years throughout the world, over 100 years in the United States
alone, for medical purposes until prohibition in 1937 by the
Federal government for political reasons; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, Federal agencies have refused to recognize
marijuana's important role in medical therapy, continue to
maintain a prohibition against marijuana's prescriptine medical
use, and recently cancelled the nation's Federal
marijuana-as-medicine program; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, these federal policies unnecessarily expose the
people of Summit County, including Breckenridge, to pain and
suffering and prevent physicians in Breckenridge from exercising
their professional judgment; now, therefore, be it </p>

<p> RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the Mayor to
direct the Police Chief and the District Attorney to make their
lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in
the possession or cultivation of hemp medical preparation for
medicinal purposes; and, be it </p>

<p> FURTHER RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the
Mayor to direct the District Attorney to allow a letter from a
treating physician to be used as prima facia evidence that hemp
medical preparations can alleviate the pain and suffering of that
patient's medical condition;, and be it </p>

<p> FURTHER RESOLVED, that the representative of the town of
Breckenridge lobby the Colorado Legislature for a state medical
marijuana bill. <br>

<title>Frisco Colorado Supports Medical Marijuana</title>

<h1>Frisco, Colorado Supports Medical Marijuana </h1>

<p> From a posting by NORML </p>

<p> On July 5, 1994 after hearing 2 hours of testimony from a
sympathetic and supportive crowd, the Frisco Town Council
unanimously passed a resolution urging the state of Colorado to
&quot;reactivate the research program on the use and dispensing
of marijuana for medical purposes.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<p> The resolution goes on to say, &quot;Whereas, upon the
legislative report of findings establishing the effective use of
marijuana as a therapeutic drug, the Town of Frisco strongly
encourages the State of Colorado and the federal government to
legalize the dispensing of marijuana for medical purposes
pursuant to federal and state guidelines.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<p> Frisco is the second town in Colorado to publicly address the
ban on medical access to marijuana. In April, residents of
Breckenridge voted 261-213 in favor of an ordinance ordering the
police chief and district attorney to make the arrest and
prosecution of those using or cultivating marijuana for medical
purposes their lowest priority. <br>

<h1><center>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution </center></h1>

<p> <center>(Full Text of Proposed Resolution)</center> </p>

<hr>

<p> The following is the full text of the resolution that was
proposed to the City of Bainbridge Island, Washington. </p>

<h3><center>Marijuana for Medical Use Resolution </center></h3>

<p> The people of the City of Bainbridge Island (B.I.) do ordain
as follows: </p>

<h4>SECTION 1 TITLE:</h4>

<p> The title of this resolution shall be: The City of Bainbridge
Island Medical Marijuana Resolution. </p>

<h4>SECTION 2 PURPOSE: </h4>

<p> The purposes of this resolution are: (1) To express the
compassion of the people of B.I. for the medically challenged in
our community whose sufferings would be alleviated by the use of
medical marijuana. (2) To express the strong support of the
people of B.I. for the restoration of Cannabis/Marijuana medical
preparations to the list of available medicines which can be
prescribed by licensed physicians. (3) To direct the elected
officials of B.I. to take whatever actions may be within their
power to support the availability of Cannabis/Marijuana for
medical use. </p>

<h4>SECTION 3 DEFINITIONS: </h4>

<p> For the purposes of this resolution, Cannabis/Marijuana
medical preparations shall mean: all products made from cannabis
or marijuana, in any form intended or used for human consumption,
for the treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an
adjunct to any medical procedure for the treatment of Cancer,
Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical or healing purpose
defined within the bounds of the doctor/patient relationship. </p>

<h4>SECTION 4 FINDINGS: </h4>

<p> The people of B.I. make the following findings: </p>

<ol>
    <li>SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MEDICINE.<br>
        Scientific and medical studies by the National Academy of
        Science have shown Cannabis/Marijuana to be a safe and
        effective medicine with very low toxicity compared to
        most prescription drugs. It has been shown to be
        effective in the treatment of glaucoma; epilepsy; muscle
        spasticity; arthritis; the nausea, vomiting and appetite
        loss associated with chemotherapy's; anxiety and
        depression; and the symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol
        and narcotics. </li>
    <li>DOCTORS AND PATIENTS NEED THE CANNABIS/MARIJUANA OPTION.<br>
        Studies show that one-third of all cancer patients
        discontinue potentially life- saving chemotherapy due to
        the severe and debilitating side effects. The same is
        true for many AIDS patients receiving AZT or other
        similar therapies. Most physicians surveyed said that
        they would prescribe Cannabis/Marijuana if legally
        available. Half of all cancer specialists surveyed said
        that they have already encouraged at least one of their
        patients to break the law and use Cannabis/Marijuana to
        ease the violent nausea and vomiting associated with
        their current treatments. </li>
    <li>UNITED NATIONS APPROVES PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA.<br>
        In May of 1991, the United Nations Narcotic Control Board
        voted overwhelmingly to reclassify Cannabis/Marijuana,
        placing it back on Schedule II, and making it available
        by prescription. The United States Representative to this
        Board voted in favor of rescheduling. </li>
    <li>FEDERAL COURT ORDERS PRESCRIPTION MARIJUANA. <br>
        Despite a federal court order recognizing the
        &quot;clearly established medical value&quot; of
        Cannabis/Marijuana, and mandating that it be reclassified
        to Schedule II and available by prescription, the federal
        government continues to deny access to this safe and
        effective medicine. </li>
    <li>POLITICS BEFORE PATIENTS. <br>
        By its own admission, the federal government continues to
        deny access to Cannabis/Marijuana for political rather
        than medical reasons. Using patients as pawns in the ever
        escalating war on drugs, current policies place message
        before medicine, convenience before compassion, and
        politics before patients. </li>
</ol>

<h4>SECTION 5 IMPLEMENTATION:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Within ninety (90) days of the date of the passing of
        this resolution, the Bainbridge Island City Council
        (B.I.C.C.) shall transmit the text of this resolution to
        the President of the United States, the Governor of the
        State of Washington, and the Federal and State
        Legislative Representatives of Bainbridge Island and urge
        them to take whatever actions that may be in their power
        to: <ol>
            <li>Restore Cannabis/Marijuana preparations to the
                list of available medicines which can be
                prescribed by licensed physicians. </li>
            <li>Provide for by law and institute such mechanisms
                as may be necessary to insure a safe and
                affordable supply of Cannabis/Marijuana for
                medical use. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The B.I.C.C. shall request the Police Department and the
        City Attorney to adhere to the spirit of this resolution
        in setting their priorities and to exercise whatever
        discretionary powers they may possess to minimize the
        negative impacts of current Cannabis/Marijuana
        restrictions, where medical use is apparent. </li>
    <li>The B.I.C.C. shall direct the Bremerton-Kitsap County
        Health District to monitor developments in the field of
        Cannabis/Marijuana medicine, including research projects,
        trial studies, or current governmental programs and to
        make available, upon request by any doctor or patient,
        accurate and timely information regarding the efficacy of
        Cannabis/Marijuana for various medical conditions. </li>
</ol>

<h4>SECTION 6 SEVERABILITY: </h4>

<p> If any of these provisions are held to be invalid, all
remaining portions of this resolution shall remain in full force
and effect. </p>

<h4>SECTION 7 EFFECTIVE DATE: </h4>

<p> This resolution shall take effect as provided by law. </p>

<h1>Alameda County Supports Medical Marijuana </h1>

<p> From a posting by NORML </p>

<p> On July 12, 1994, the Alameda County, CA Board of Supervisors
passed a resolution urging the California state legislature to
pass -- and the Governor to sign -- Senate Bill 1364 which would
reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II
substance, thereby making it available for use by prescription. </p>

<p> Alameda County joins almost a dozen other locales in
California as going on record as favoring legal medical access to
marijuana. </p>

<h1><center>Santa Cruz County Measure A <br>
Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative</center></h1>

<hr>

<p> This measure was passed by over 75% of the vote. </p>

<p> (Full Text of Proposed Initiative) </p>

<p> The people of the County of Santa Cruz do ordain as follows: </p>

<h2>SECTION 1. TITLE: </h2>

<p> The title of this ordinance shall be: The Santa Cruz County
Medical Marijuana Ordinance. </p>

<h2>SECTION 2. PURPOSE: </h2>

<p> The purposes of this ordinance are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>To express the compassion of the people of Santa Cruz
        County for the medically challenged in our community
        whose sufferings would be alleviated by the use of
        medical marijuana. <br>
    </li>
    <li>To express the strong support of the people of Santa Cruz
        County for the restoration of Cannabis / Marijuana
        medical preparations to the list of available medicines
        which can be prescribed by licensed physicians. <br>
    </li>
    <li>To direct the elected officials of Santa Cruz County to
        take whatever actions may be within their power to
        support the availability of Cannabis / Marijuana for
        medical use. </li>
</ol>

<h2>SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS: </h2>

<p> For the purposes of this ordinance, Cannabis / Marijuana
medical preparations shall mean: all products made from cannabis
or marijuana, in any form intended or used for human consumption,
for the treatment of any disease; the relief of pain; or as an
adjunct to any medical procedure for the treatment of Cancer,
Glaucoma, or AIDS; or for any other medical or healing purpose
defined within the bounds of the doctor/patient relationship. </p>

<h2>SECTION 4. FINDINGS: </h2>

<p> The people of the County of Santa Cruz make the following
findings: </p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Safe And Effective Medicine. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Scientific and medical studies by the
        National Academy of Science have shown Cannabis /
        Marijuana to be a safe and effective medicine with very
        low toxicity compared to most prescription drugs. It has
        been shown to be effective in the treatment of glaucoma;
        epilepsy; muscle spasticity; arthritis; the nausea,
        vomiting and appetite loss associated with
        chemotherapies; anxiety and depression; and the symptoms
        of withdrawal from alcohol and narcotics. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Doctors And Patients Need The Cannabis /
        Marijuana Option. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Studies show that one-third of all
        cancer patients discontinue potentially life-saving
        chemotherapy due to the severe and debilitating side
        effects. The same is true for many AIDS patients
        receiving AZT or other similar therapies. Most physicians
        surveyed said that they would prescribe Cannabis /
        Marijuana if legally available. Half of all cancer
        specialists surveyed said that they have already
        encouraged at least one of their patients to break the
        law and use Cannabis / Marijuana to ease the violent
        nausea and vomiting associated with their current
        treatments. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">United Nations Approves Prescription
        Marijuana. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">In May of 1991, the United Nations
        Narcotic Control Board voted overwhelmingly to reclassify
        Cannabis / Marijuana, placing it back on Schedule 2, and
        making it available by prescription. The United States
        Representative to this board voted in favor of
        rescheduling. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Federal Court Orders Prescription
        Marijuana. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">Despite a Federal Court Order
        recognizing the &quot;clearly established medical
        value&quot; of Cannabis / Marijuana, and mandating that
        it be reclassified to Schedule 2 and available by
        prescription, the federal government continues to deny
        access to this safe and effective medicine. <br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><font size="4">Politics Before Patients. </font> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">By its own admission, the federal
        government continues to deny access to Cannabis /
        Marijuana for political rather than medical reasons.
        Using patients as pawns in the ever-escalating War on
        Drugs, current policies place message before medicine,
        convenience before compassion, and politics before
        patients.<br>
        </font></b> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4"></font></b> </li>
    <li><b><font size="4">SECTION 5. IMPLEMENTATION. </font></b> </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li><font size="4">Within 90 (ninety) days of the
        certification of the November 3, 1992 General Election,
        the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors shall transmit
        the text of this ordinance to the President of the United
        States, the Governor of the State of California, and the
        Federal and State Legislative Rep- representatives of
        Santa Cruz County and urge them to take whatever actions
        that may be in their power to: <br>

<h2>Impartial Analysis By County Counsel Santa Cruz County
Measure A <br>
Marijuana For Medical Use Initiative <br>
</h2>

<h3>If approved by a majority of those voting on this measure, it
will become a County ordinance. The measure appears on the ballot
as a result of initiative petitions which gathered more than the
number of signatures required by state law for placement on the
ballot. <br>
If enacted, the measure will not change existing laws on the
availability of marijuana for medical purposes, or on the
illegality of marijuana possession. Rather, the measure would
constitute a policy statement favoring the increased availability
of marijuana for medical purposes. <br>
If enacted, the measure would require the Santa Cruz County Board
of Supervisors to take certain actions to communicate the policy
to State and Federal elected officials. The Board of Supervisors
would also be required to request the Sheriff and District
Attorney of Santa Cruz County to adhere to the spirit of the
ordinance in setting their priorities, and to minimize the
negative impacts of legal restrictions on marijuana for medical
use to the extent they have discretion to do so. Because no
change in the criminal law on this subject results from its
enactment, however, the second directive to the Sheriff and
District Attorney is of uncertain effect. <br>
The Board of Supervisors would also be required to direct the
County Health Services Agency to monitor research developments
and make information avail- able concerning medical use of
marijuana. Such activities by the Health Services Agency would be
a County cost in an undetermined amount. <br>
A &quot;yes&quot; vote authorizes enactment of the measure into
the Santa Cruz County Code and approves making the Findings set
out in the measure. A &quot;no&quot; vote rejects enactment of
the measure as a part of the Santa Cruz County Code. <br>

<h2>ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF MEASURE A <br>
</h2>

<h3>&quot;My commitment as a physician is to ease suffering and
to do no harm. Both are often possible with cannabis medicines.
The government's policy of denying patients this treatment is
indefensible. It's a matter of compassion and common sense. Vote
yes on Measure A.&quot;<br>
-Arnold Leff, MD- <br>
The emotional and financial impacts of catastrophic illness can
be devastating. For the thousands of seriously ill and disabled
Americans who have a medical necessity for cannabis/marijuana,
the devastation is compounded by a government that ignores the
best medical evidence and condemns them to a criminal black
market in their daily struggle for wellness. <br>
Measure A calls on the federal government to allow licensed
physicians to prescribe marijuana for patients with life and
sense threatening illnesses. <br>
The Controlled Substances Act allows for cannabis to be restored
to the list of available medicines if &quot;a significant
minority of physicians have accepted it as safe under medical
supervision.&quot; <br>
In 1988, after the most extensive review of the record ever
undertaken, US Administrative Law Judge Francis Young stated that
&quot;marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man. By any rational
analysis cannabis can be used safely under a supervised routine
of medical care.&quot; <br>
Dr. Leff and Judge Young are not alone. Seventy percent of cancer
specialists, 35 state legislatures (including California), the
United Nations Narcotics Control Board, the California Medical
Association, and 80% of San Francisco voters agree - cannabis
should be available to the seriously ill and disabled to ease
their pain and suffering. <br>
Measure A will ease suffering and do no harm. Simply stated,
Measure A is good medicine. Vote Yes for Compassion. Vote Yes for
Common Sense. Vote Yes on Measure A. <br>

<h2>Medical Marijuana Approved in Sonoma County </h2>

<p> <b>Miracle On Administration Drive </b> </p>

<p> <b>By: Lazar Yersersky On Tuesday, </b> </p>

<p> October l2, 1994 before a standing-room-only crowd at the
County Supervisors' hearing, Sonoma County at last passed a
resolution approving the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
Presented by Ernie Carpenter, supervisors Tim Smith and Mike Cale
voted for. Nick Esposti was the sole vote against. The
resolution, written mainly by Carol Miller, who, in spite of
bringing up a gang of kids with Michael, living on a remote
mountain without a car for at least a year, not to mention
fighting Lymes disease all the while, never flagged in her
mission of freeing marijuana for medical use. Dr Tod Mikuriya,
author of the authoritative &quot;Medical Marijuana Papers,&quot;
spoke first. Caregiver &quot;Brownie&quot; Mary Rathburn
testified to a standing ovation for her work and her indomitable
spirit. Dennis Peron, who ram- rodded the SF ballot victory,
spoke, and Bruce Sloan gave them what-for as only he can do, with
his testimony before the supervisors and with his nifty sign to
&quot;Repeal Hemp Prohibition and Restore Health&quot; outside.
Then the parade of patients began: Patti, Beth, and Barb with
AIDS. I use first names only because these very ill people are
criminals as things stand--or at least stood before today. Patti
drove herself to the hearing even though she was almost too sick
to talk. Beth, a cancer patient, spoke. Chuck, an asthmatic,
literally given the breath of life by a few daily tokes of
marijuana, was there. And a phys ed teacher half crippled with a
back injury suffered when a drunk ran into his car, explained
that only marijuana stopped his debilitating muscle spasms,
allowing him to stretch and heal his back when synthetic
pharmaceuticals, with their often toxic side effects, could not.
Sara was there suffering from giardia that wasted her away until
marijuana cured the awful nausea and allowed her to eat. Linette,
who was busted for two plants in Fairfax, was there. Now we must
unite in support of Sen. Henry Mello's Medical Legalization Bill
on the state level. And federal bills S. 784 and H.R. l709, which
will roll back restrictive regulations on nutritional products
and medical herbs (including cannabis) need our support. We must
now endeavor to get the ear of Bill Clinton or maybe Hillary.
Congratulations to S.C.R.A.P. and to everyone who worked so hard
and so long to get to this point. </p>

<h2>MARIJUANA SMOKING AS MEDICINE: A CRUEL HOAX</h2>

<p><font size="2"><b>by Gabriel G. Nahas, M.D.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Nicholas A. Pace, M.D.</b></font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><b>New York University Medical Center<br>
</b></font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2"><b>Note to Readers:.</b> Dr. Nahas is, to say
the least, a zealot on this issue. To say the least, there have
been some issues with the accuracy of his statements about
marijuana. We invite the reader to compare the statements made by
Dr. Nahas with the results of the other research studies on this
web site.</font> </p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2">The anecdotal claims concerning the unique
therapeutic properties of marijuana smoking in alleviating the
nausea and vomiting induced by the chemotherapy of cancer or of
AIDS do not withstand scientific scrutiny.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In the first place, modern therapeutics
distinguish between a crude drug and its pharmacological active
pure ingredient, in this instance between marijuana and THC.
While crude marijuana preparations made of plant material and
containing THC display similar pharmacological properties as THC,
their overall effect is quite different. Indeed, marijuana
contains in addition to THC 60 other cannabinoids which modify
absorption, availability and transformation of THC in the body,
and which are also biologically active. Besides cannabinoids, 360
other compounds have been identified in the plant material such
as terpenes, flavinoids, furan derivatives and alkaloids. The
smoke if a marijuana cigarette contains in its gas phase the
noxious vapors of carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, acrolein,
toluene, nitrosamine and vinylchloride, and in its particulate
phase phenol, creosol, methyl and napthalene. Marijuana smoke
also contains twice as many cancer producing substances
(benzanthracene and benzopyrene) as a tobacco cigarette of the
same weight. The respective amount of all of these different
chemicals will vary with each marijuana cigarette and its
resulting smoke, therefore prescriptions of marijuana cannot
comply with the Pure Food and Drug Act, which requires that all
medicines be labeled with the exact amount of chemicals they
contain. In addition, crude drug marijuana preparation can also
be contaminated with salmonella bacteria which gives diarrhea and
with a fungus, aspergillus, which may cause severe
bronchopneumonia (It has been suggested that the marijuana
cigarettes prescribed to patients be sterilized.). <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Damaging effects in man caused by prolonged
exposure to marijuana smoking have been reported in two recent
International Symposia; they include emphysema-like symptoms,
cancer of the lung, mouth and tongue, prolonged impairment of
memory and of psychomotor performance resulting in train or car
accidents, a six-fold increase in the incidence of schizophrenia,
leukemia in children born from marijuana smoking mothers and
damage to the growing fetus.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">However, if smoked marijuana had unique
therapeutic properties, these forgoing undesired effects could be
overlooked. Prominent cancer specialists such as Dr. R. J. Gralla
of Sloane-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center, Dr. D. S. Ettinger of
Johns Hopkins Medical School, Dr. George Hyman of Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and Dr. John
Laszlo, Vice President for Research of the American Cancer
Society have concluded that the crude drug marijuana taken by
inhalation has only limited effectiveness in the treatment of
vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and documented negative
effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular and immunity systems. The
American Cancer Society stated in 1989 that the results of
clinical investigations were insufficient to warrant the
decontrol of marijuana smoking for medical use. the American
Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
expressed a similar opinion.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The therapeutic applications of smoked
marijuana have been traced down to the psychoactive ingredient it
contains: THC. This compound taken by mouth will relieve the
vomiting resulting from cancer chemotherapy in a limited number
of patients. But THC also produces acute undesirable psychic and
cardiovascular symptoms, and its depressant effect on immunity is
not a good indication for patients with cancer or AIDS who
already have impaired immunity. To treat nausea associated with
chemotherapy, modern drugs with much greater bioavailability,
specificity, and effectiveness, and less side effects than THC,
such as metoclopramide and ondansetron, have already been used on
millions of patients. And these drugs have become the preferred
choice of the majority of physicians who wish to treat their
patients in the safest and most effective fashion. However, THC,
because of its therapeutic properties, has been reclassified from
Schedule I to Schedule II, which permits its prescription by
physicians. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Marinol is one of the presently available
preparations. But most other countries, signatories of the Single
Convention of the United Nations on Controlled Substances, did
not concur with the U.S. Reclassification and kept THC in
Schedule I, among drugs which have no unique therapeutic
usefulness and high abuse potential. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">While the reclassification of THC to Schedule
II might be understandable, this would not be the case for
smoking the crude drug marijuana, which would as a result become
more available and more readily diverted for non-medical use.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">There is no medical justification for the use
of marijuana smoking in the treatment of nausea and vomiting
associated with cancer or AIDS chemotherapy. Other claims
formulated in the prescientific area of medicine concerning the
therapeutic properties of marijuana smoking for epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, chronic pain, pruritis, menstrual
cramps, and labor pain are purely hearsay and may even be harmful
to the patient. Such claims have been nonetheless recently
revived by the same Harvard professor who has also stated that
'used no more than two or three times a week, cocaine creates no
serious problem.' His latest book, &quot;Marijuana, the Forbidden
Medicine,&quot; is a loose compendium of unverifiable anecdotes.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The unilateral reclassification by the United
States of marijuana from Schedule I to II would perpetuate a
cruel hoax by sending the wrong message to uninformed patients
and health professionals who rely on safe and effective medicine.
There is no medical justification for the use of marijuana
smoking in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with
cancer or AIDS chemotherapy.&quot;<br>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><em>Marihuana as Medicine: A
Plea for Reconsideration <br>
</em></font>by Lester Grinspoon, MD James B. Bakalar, JD<br>
<b>Journal of the American medical Association, June, 1995</b> </p>

<hr size="4" width="60%">

<p>BETWEEN 1840 and 1900, European and American medical journals
published more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of the
drug known then as Cannabis indica (or Indian hemp) and now as
marihuana. It was recommended as an appetite stimulant, muscle
relaxant, analgesic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant. As late as
1913 Sir William Osler recommended it as the most satisfactory
remedy for migraine. </p>

<p>Today the 5000-year medical history of cannabis has been
almost forgotten. Its use declined in the early 20th century
because the potency of preparations was variable, responses to
oral ingestion were erratic, and alternatives became available --
injectable opiates and, later, synthetic drugs such as aspirin
and barbiturates. In the United States, the final blow was struck
by the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Designed to prevent nonmedical
use, this law made cannabis so difficult to obtain for medical
purposes that it was removed from the pharmacopeia. It is now
confined to Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act as a
drug that has a high potential for abuse, lacks an accepted
medical use, and is unsafe for use under medical supervision. </p>

<p>In 1972 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
later renamed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to
transfer marihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally
prescribed. As the proceedings continued, other parties joined,
including the Physicians Association for AIDS [acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome] Care. It was only in 1986, after many
years of legal maneuvering, that the DEA acceded to the demand
for the public hearings required by law. During the hearings,
which lasted 2 years, many patients and physicians testified, and
thousands of pages of documentation were introduced. In 1988 the
DEA's own administrative law judge, Francis L. Young, declared
that marihuana in its natural form fulfilled the legal
requirement of currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States. He added that it was &quot;one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.&quot; His order
that the marihuana plant be transferred to Schedule II was
overruled, not by any medical authority, but by the DEA itself,
which issued a final rejection of all pleas for reclassification
in Mach 1992. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a few patients have been able to obtain marihuana
legally for therapeutic purposes. Since 1978, legislation
permitting patients with certain disorders to use marihuana with
a physician's approval has been enacted in 36 states. Although
federal regulations and procedures made the laws difficult to
implement, 10 states eventually established formal marihuana
research programs to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. These
programs were later abandoned, mainly because the bureaucratic
burden on physicians and patients became intolerable. </p>

<p>Growing demand also forced the FDA to Institute an Individual
Treatment IND (commonly referred to as a Compassionate IND) for
the use of physicians whose patients needed marihuana because no
other drug would produce the same therapeutic effect. The
application process was made enormously complicated, and most
physicians did not want to become involved, especially since many
believed there was some stigma attached to prescribing cannabis.
Between 1976 and 1988 the government reluctantly awarded about a
half dozen Compassionate INDs for the use of marihuana. In 1989
the FDA was deluged with new applications from people with AIDS,
and the number granted rose to 34 within a year. In June 1991,
the Public Health Service announced that the program would be
suspended because it undercut the administration's opposition to
the use of illegal drugs. After that no new Compassionate INDs
were granted, and the program was discontinued in March 1992.
Eight patients are still receiving marihuana under the original
program; for everyone else it is officially a forbidden medicine.
</p>

<p>And yet physicians and patients in increasing numbers continue
to relearn through personal experience the lessons of the 19th
century. Many people know that marihuana is now being used
illegally for the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy.
Some know that it lowers intraocular pressure in glaucoma.
Patients have found it useful as an anticonvulsant, as a muscle
relaxant in spastic disorders, and as an appetite stimulant in
the wasting syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
It is also being used to relieve phantom limb pain, menstrual
cramps, and other types of chronic pain, including (as Osler
might have predicted) migraine.2 Polls and voter referenda have
repeatedly indicated that the vast majority of Americans think
marihuana should be medically available. </p>

<p>One of marihuana's greatest advantages as a medicine is its
remarkable safety. It has little effect on major physiological
functions. There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the
basis of animal models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is
estimated as 40,000 to 1. By comparison, the ratio is between 3
and 50 to 1 for secobarbital and between 4 and 10 to 1 for
ethanol. Marihuana is also far less addictive and far less
subject to abuse than many drugs now used as muscle relaxants,
hypnotics, and analgesics. The chief legitimate concern is the
effect of smoking on the lungs. Cannabis smoke carries even more
tars and other particulate matter than tobacco smoke. But the
amount smoked is much less, especially in medical use, and once
marihuana is an openly recognized medicine, solutions may be
found. Water pipes are a partial answer; ultimately a technology
for the inhalation of cannabinoid vapors could be developed. Even
If smoking continued, legal availability would make it easier to
take precautions against aspergilli and other pathogens. At
present, the greatest danger in medical use of marihuana is its
illegality, which imposes much anxiety and expense on suffering
people, forces them to bargain with illicit drug dealers, and
exposes them to the threat of criminal prosecution. </p>

<p>The main active substance in cannabis, [delta-9]-
tetrahydrocannabinol ([delta-9]-THC), has been available for
limited purposes as a Schedule II synthetic drug since 1985. This
medicine, dronabinol (Marinol), taken orally in capsule form, is
sometimes said to obviate the need for medical marihuana.
Patients and physicians who have tried both disagree. The dosage
and duration of action of marihuana are easier to control, and
other cannabinoids in the marihuana plant may modify the action
of [delta-9]-THC. The development of cannabinoids in pure form
should certainly be encouraged, but the time and resources
required are great and at present unavailable. In these
circumstances, further isolation, testing, and development of
individual cannabinoids should not be considered a substitute for
meeting the immediate needs of suffering people. </p>

<p>Although it is often objected that the medical usefulness of
marihuana has not been demonstrated by controlled studies,
several informal experiments involving large numbers of subjects
suggest an advantage for marihuana over oral [delta-9]-THC and
other medicines. For example, from 1978 through 1986 the state
research program in New Mexico provided marihuana or synthetic
[delta-9]-THC to about 250 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
after conventional medications failed to control their nausea and
vomiting. A physician who worked with the program testified at a
DEA hearing that for these patients marihuana was clearly
superior to both chlorpromazine and synthetic [delta-9]-THC.3 It
is true that we do not have studies controlled according to the
standards required by the FDA -- chiefly because legal,
bureaucratic, and financial obstacles are constantly put in the
way. The situation is ironical, since so much research has been
done on marihuana, often in unsuccessful attempts to prove its
dangerous and addictive character, that we know more about it
than about most prescription drugs. </p>

<p>Physicians should offer more encouragement to controlled
research, but it too has limitations. Individual therapeutic
responses can be obscured by the statistical results of group
experiments in which there is little effort to identify the
specific features of a patient that affect the drug response.
Furthermore, much of our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well
as plant derivatives comes from anecdotal evidence. For example,
as early as 1976 several small, methodologically imperfect, and
relatively obscure studies had shown that taking an aspirin a day
could prevent a second heart attack. In 1988 a large-scale
experiment demonstrated dramatic effects. This story is
suggestive, because marihuana, like aspirin, is a substance known
to be unusually safe and to have enormous potential health
benefits. </p>

<p>Cannabis can also bring about immediate relief of suffering
measurable in a study with only one subject. In the experimental
method known as the single patient randomized trial, active and
placebo treatments are administered randomly in alternation or
succession to a patient. The method is often useful when large
scale controlled studies are impossible or inappropriate because
the disorder is rare, the patient is atypical, or the response to
the treatment is idiosyncratic. Many patients, either
deliberately or because of unreliable supplies, have informally
carried out somewhat similar experiments by alternating periods
of cannabis use with periods of no use in the treatment of
various disorders.2(pp.133-135) </p>

<p>The American Medical Association was one of the few
organizations that raised a voice in opposition to the Marihuana
Tax Act of 1937, yet today most physicians seem to take little
active interest in the subject, and their silence is often cited
by those who are determined that marihuana shall remain a
forbidden medicine. Meanwhile, many physicians pretend to ignore
the fact that their patients with cancer, AIDS, or multiple
sclerosis are smoking marihuana for relief; some quietly
encourage them. In a 1990 survey, 44% of oncologists said they
had suggested that a patient smoke marihuana for relief of the
nausea induced by chemotherapy.4 If marihuana were actually
unsafe for use even under medical supervision, as its Schedule I
status explicitly affirms, this recommendation would be
unthinkable. It is time for physicians to acknowledge more openly
that the present classification is scientifically, legally, and
morally wrong. </p>

<p>Physicians have both a right and a duty to be skeptical about
therapeutic claims for any substance, but only after putting
aside fears and doubts connected with the stigma of illicit
nonmedical drug use. Advocates of medical use of marihuana are
sometimes charged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way
for &quot;recreational&quot; use. The accusation is false as
applied to its target, but expresses in a distorted form a truth
about some opponents of medical marihuana; they will not admit
that it can be a safe and effective medicine largely because they
are stubbornly committed to exaggerating its dangers when used
for nonmedical purposes. </p>

<p>We are not asking readers for immediate agreement with our
affirmation that marihuana is medically useful, but we hope they
will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its
potential. The ostensible indifference of physicians should no
longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in
the shadows. </p>

<p> <center><em><font size="5">Marijuana Compassion Clubs<br>
</font></em>by Tim Whitmire<br>
<b>Associated Press, August 10, 1995</b> </center> </p>

<hr align="center" width="60%" size="4">

<p> PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- As Todd McCormick sits in an Ohio
jail, charged with possessing 31 pounds of marijuana, he eagerly
awaits the day when he can resume giving away the drug. </p>

<p> McCormick and his girlfriend were arrested while driving from
San Diego to Providence to start a &quot;compassion club&quot;
for seriously ill people who use marijuana to dull their pain. </p>

<p> &quot;When I get home this time, I'm going nuts,&quot;
McCormick, 25, said in a telephone interview from the Correction
Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker. &quot;I'll have fields in my
front yard. ... I'm going ballistic, no holds barred. If they
want to come get me, put me in jail, so be it.&quot; </p>

<p> McCormick estimates there are between 30 and 50 compassion
clubs across the country. The 3,200-member San Francisco Cannabis
Buyer's Club is believed to be the largest such group. </p>

<p> The clubs are organized by people who grow marijuana and then
visit support groups for patients with AIDS and other diseases.
They offer the drug for free or very cheaply. </p>

<p> McCormick, who runs the 20-member San Diego Compassionate Use
Club, said members must provide photo identification and a
doctor's letter describing their condition. They also must sign a
statement indicating they know they are breaking the law. </p>

<p> The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is aware of
compassion clubs but has not targeted them for enforcement. </p>

<p> The Food and Drug Administration has granted marijuana
prescriptions to 15 people suffering from cancer, AIDS, spinal
cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. Seven have since
died. </p>

<p> The Bush administration put a stop to medical testing and
medical use of marijuana in 1992, saying it could harm patients
who had safer alternatives. The Clinton administration upheld the
ban last year. </p>

<p> &quot;Sound scientific studies supporting these claims are
lacking despite anecdotal claims that smoked marijuana is
beneficial,&quot; Assistant Health Secretary Philip Lee said in
announcing the decision to members of Congress who support
medical marijuana use. </p>

<p> But McCormick says there are studies which claim marijuana
can ease the pain of cancer and AIDS treatments, alleviate muscle
spasms for people with spinal cord injuries and relieve the eye
pressure that blinds glaucoma sufferers. </p>

<p> He has used marijuana to ease the pain of Histiocytosis X, a
cancerous overgrowth of the cells that normally protect people
from infection. The disease attacks bone marrow, the blood, liver
and spleen. McCormick had the first five vertebrae of his spine
fused when he was 2 and underwent eight more operations over the
next seven years. </p>

<p> McCormick, who was in constant pain, first discovered
marijuana while riding in a car with his mother as she smoked it.
&quot;I went from not wanting to do anything to `Can I go out and
play?'&quot; he said. </p>

<p> He said marijuana reduced the nausea and loss of appetite
caused by radiation treatments and chemotherapy. He continued to
use it after his cancer went into remission because it eased the
pain from his fused vertebrae and the side effects of radiation
treatments, which stunted the growth of his left hip, leaving his
left leg two inches shorter than the right. </p>

<p> &quot;(Marijuana) sets your mind at ease which sets your body
at ease which allows your body to heal,&quot; McCormick said.
&quot;If I don't have cannabis it's too uncomfortable to stretch.
It dulls the pain enough that I can sit and concentrate on
movement.&quot; </p>

<p> McCormick and Natalie Byrd were pulled over July 18 by an
Ohio state trooper because the curtains on their van were drawn,
blocking the rear view. Three days later, Drug Enforcement Agents
raided McCormick's San Diego club, seizing marijuana, growing
tools and signatures supporting a California ballot initiative to
legalize marijuana. </p>

<p> McCormick and Byrd, who were both still jailed today, could
get up to 30 years in prison if convicted of drug possession.
Whether McCormick planned to use the marijuana for medicinal
purposes makes no difference in the case, prosecutor William Bish
said. </p>

<p> A group called the Todd McCormick Alliance is campaigning on
the Internet computer network and through marijuana legalization
groups to raise money for McCormick's $150,000 bail and legal
expenses. They hope the case will draw attention to their fight
for legalized marijuana. </p>

<p> McCormick said the risk of arrest is worth giving other sick
people the opportunity for relief. &quot;I'm trying to remove the
criminal element,&quot; he said. &quot;You shouldn't have to go
on the street.&quot; <br>

double-blinded oral administration of either 10 or 5 mg THC or
placebo. The blinded examiner correctly identified the trials in
which the patients received THC in seven of nine cases. For the
group, 10 mg THC significantly reduced spasticity by clinical
measurement (P less than 0.01). Quadriceps EMG interference
pattern was reduced in those four patients with primarily
extensor spasticity. THC was administered to eight other patients
with spasticity and other CNS lesions. Responses varied, but

<title>USA Today Endorses Medical Marijuana 7-18-96</title>

<h1>Editorial from USA Today</h1>

<p> <b> Re: Medical Marijuana </b> </p>

<p> <b>July 18, 1996</b> </p>

<hr>

<h2>Our View </h2>

<h3>Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill </h3>

<p> Many who suffer from various diseases could benefit from
marijuana. But they're denied relief. </p>

<p> In the war on drugs, thousands of Americans are suffering
from friendly fire. </p>

<p> They are, for the most part, patients with cancer, multiple
sclerosis and AIDS who are doomed to needless pain and weightloss
syndrome because lawmakers won't approve the medicinal use of
marijuana. </p>

<p> Marijuana is one of the least toxic medical compounds in the
world. It poses far fewer pulmonary risks than tobacco and is
less addictive than alcohol. It is even less deadly than aspirin,
which causes at least 1,000 deaths a year. </p>

<p> Despite its benign qualities, marijuana is versatile and
effective. It has been used to treat pain, depression and spasms.
It has been used to help prevent glaucoma-related blindness and
appears effective in battling weight loss in AIDS patients. It
also has been widely used to mitigate nausea caused by
chemotherapy. Indeed, a study by researchers at the Kennedy
School of Government found that 44% of the surveyed oncologists
had recommended marijuana to at least one patient for nausea. </p>

<p> Polls find public support for marijuana's medicinal use
running from 65% to 78%. And 22 states have acted to endorse
medicinal marijuana, often either by authorizing state-sponsored
research or simply allowing physicians to prescribe it despite
federal prohibitions that keep such laws from going into effect.
California's Legislature has twice passed laws enabling such use.
Both were vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson, forcing a third attempt in
the form of an initiative on the November ballot. </p>

<p> Opponents say the medical value of marijuana is anecdotal.
But those anecdotes number in the thousands and date back
thousands of years. Penicillin was approved for use with far less
experience and data - six patients, to be exact. </p>

<p> Obviously, studies are needed to better assess marijuana's
efficacy. Several, including one done in New York state, have
shown marijuana to be an effective alternative to other
anti-nausea treatments. And the Food and Drug Administration has
endorsed additional research. </p>

<p> But why make today's suffering patients wait, particularly
those with diseases that make the potential side effects look
trivial? </p>

<p> Medicinal marijuana use doesn't betray the nation's war on
drugs. Illegal use or trafficking can still be prosecuted.
Moreover, there's no reason to fear that the new leniency will
increase drug use. The same concern has been expressed about
needle exchange programs, used to prevent the spread of AIDS
among heroin addicts. But numerous reviews, including one by the
National Academy of Sciences, show no resulting increase in
heroin use. </p>

<p> It is entirely possible to fight the drug war without harming
innocent civilians in the process. But lawmakers must be careful
to choose the right battles. Therapeutic marijuana use isn't one
of them. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Opposing View </h2>

<h3>Marijuana isn't medicine</h3>

<p> According to experts, marijuana has no scientific value and
actually may be harmful. </p>

<p> By Eric A. Voth </p>

<p> The saga of &quot;medicinal&quot; marijuana continues to
unfold. Two new chapters are coming forth which should be of
major concern: </p>

<p> California will vote Nov. 5 on a ballot initiative which
dramatically liberalizes the availability of crude, smoked
marijuana for individuals. </p>

<p> Arizona will consider an initiative which would make all of
what the law calls Schedule I drugs available as medicines. This
means heroin, LSD, methamphetamine, ecstasy, marijuana, etc.,
could be prescribed to patients who allege benefits. </p>

<p> Marijuana is not a safe and effective medicine. </p>

<p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has
clearly defined that marijuana is not a medicine. </p>

<p> The National Institutes of Health have reviewed the issue and
determined that crude marijuana adds nothing to the treatment of
sick patients, actually adds risk to patients and has no
scientifically proven benefits over existing medicines. </p>

<p> Neither the American Cancer Society nor the American Medical
Association supports smoking marijuana as medicine. </p>

<p> Voters should realize that the move to legitimize marijuana
or other illegal drugs as medicines is driven by organizations
seeking to generally legalize drugs. </p>

<p> The smoke screens they lay down are very similar to the
deceit and misrepresentation by the tobacco industry which have
drawn so much criticism from the public. To support marijuana or
other illegal drugs as medicines is like suggesting that tobacco
should be allowed as a medicine for anxiety or weight loss. </p>

<p> Marijuana as a medicine is part of the grand scheme of
&quot;harm reduction&quot; advocates who will also propose such
things as decriminalization of drugs and needle exchanges. These
are flawed policies which do not seek to actually reduce drug
use. </p>

<p> Needle exchanges, for instance, do not clearly demonstrate
reductions in disease, do not reduce drug use and do not deal
with product liability and exposure issues surrounding the
handing out of thousands of needles to addicts. </p>

<p> It is tragic that the proponents of medicinal marijuana and
harm-reduction policies are taking advantage of cancer and AIDS
sufferers to further their social agendas. </p>

<p> Let's provide sick patients with good medicine rather than
stepping back to the days of potions and herbal remedies. </p>

<p><font size="3">The traditional use of Cannabis as an
analgesic, anti-asthmatic, and anti-rheumatic drug is well
established. This British study also suggests that cultivation of
Cannabis plants rich in Cannabidiol (CBD) and other phenolic
substances would be useful not only as fiber producing plants but
also for medicinal purposes in the treatment of certain
inflammatory disorders. CBD was found to be more effective than
aspirin as an anti-inflammatory agent. &quot;Analgesic and

<p><font size="3">Abstract---Two extracts of Cannabis sativa
herb, one being cannabinoid--free (ethanol) and the other
containing the cannabinoids (petroleum), were shown to inhibit
PBQ- induced writhing in mouse when given orally and also to
antagonize tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) -induced erythema
of mouse skin when applied topically. With the exception of
cannabinol (CBN) and delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-1-THC),
the cannabinoids and olivetol (their biosynthetic precursor)
demonstrated activity in the PBQ test exhibiting their maximal
effect at doses of about 100 mcg/kg. Delta-1-THC only became
maximally effective in doses of 10 mg/kg. This higher dose
corresponded to that which induced catalepsy and is indicative of
a central action. CBN produce a 40% inhibition of PBQ-induced
writhing. Cannabidiol (CBD) was the most effective of the
cannabinoids at doses of 100 mcg/kg. Doses of cannabinoids that
were effective in the analgesic test orally were used topically
to antagonize TPA-induced erythema of skin. The fact that
delta-1-THC and CBN were the least effective in this test
suggests a structural relationship between analgesic activity and
antiinflammatory activity among the cannabinoids related to their
peripheral actions and separate from the central effects of
delta-1-THC. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">INTRODUCTION &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Various preparations of Cannabis sativa have
been employed for their medicinal effects, including antipyretic,
antirheumatic, antiallergic, and analgesic purposes (1). Extracts
of Cannabis have been shown to possess analgesic activity (2, 3),
and delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-1-THC), the psychoactive
component of Cannabis has also been shown to possess this
activity in various models (4-6). In addition, cannabinol (CBN)
but not cannabidiol (CBD) was shown to exhibit analgesic activity
in vivo (7). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is possible that the antiinflammatory and
antiasthmatic properties of this herb are mediated through
effects on arachidonate metabolism. However, constituents of
Cannabis are known to stimulate (8,9) and inhibit (10-12)
prostaglandin (PG) release by influencing enzymes of this pathway
(13, 14). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">A cannabinoid or an extract of Cannabis with
little or no central effects could be of use therapeutically. In
this paper, we have examined the antiinflammatory potential of
two extracts of Cannabis, pure cannabinoids and olivetol (a
cannabinoid biosynthetic precursor) in two models of
inflammation, in an attempt to separate on a structural basis the
peripheral from the central action of these phenolic drugs.
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">MATERIALS AND METHODS &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The folowing were used: aspirin (Sigma Chemical
Co., Poole, Dorset.), tripotassium citrate (analytical grade),
all cannabinoids except CBG (Sigma), and CBG (Makor Chemicals,
Jerusalem, Israel). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Preparation of Drugs: PBQ Test. Cannabinoids
and cannabis extracts were suspended in a 1% ethanolic solution
containing 2.5% w/v Tween. Aspirin was dissolved in a 40 mg/ml
solution of tripotassium citrate. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Phenyl Benzoquinone Writhing (PBQ) and
Preparation of PBQ Solution. A 0.04% solution of PBQ was prepared
immediately before use by dissolving PBQ in warm ethanol and
diluting with water at 40 degrees C ( 15) bringing the ethanolic
concentration to 5% (16). The bottle was stoppered, foil paper
wrapped around it, and the solution maintained at 34 degrees C.
Deterioration of the solution occurs if left exposed to light and
air (17).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Administration of Drugs. Male CDI male (Charles
River) weighing 18-20 g were starved overnight for the
experiment. Animals were placed in a thermostatically controlled
environment maintained at 34 degrees C. Mice were orally
administered test drug 20 min before the intraperitoneal
injection of PBQ (4 mg/kg). Five minutes after injection, a hand
tally counter was used to record the number of stretching
movements for each mouse in a 5-min period. Control animals were
only administered the vehicle. Note less than five animals were
used per dose. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Statistical Analysis. Results are expressed as
mean percentage inhibition of control (+SEM) in the case of PBQ
test. IC-50s were obtained from graphs relating probit percentage
inhibition (ordinate) against log dose (abscissa). The IC-50 is
that dose of drug which would inhibit PBQ-induced writhing by
50%. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Tetradecanoyl phorbol-acetate-induced (TPA)
Erythema of Mouse Ear. In order to exclude the possibility of a
central mechanism of action (see Discussion), compounds also were
tested for their ability to inhibit TPA-induced erythema on mouse
ears in 100% of the animals was chosen as the challenging dose
for inhibition studies, measured 4 h after application (18).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Test drugs were dissolved in ethanol and 5 ul
applied to the inner ear of the mouse 15 min before the
application of 1 mcg TPA in 5 ul acetone. Only one dose of test
dug was used for this experiment, 100 mcg/mcl ethanols, except
trifluoperazine at 1 mg/5 ul. The other ear acted as a control. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The results were expressed as percentage
inhibition, taken to mean the complete suppression of erythema in
the test animals, as described in reference 19.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">RESULTS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PBQ-Induced Writhing. CBD, CBG, olivetol,
ethanolic extract, and petroleum spirit extract produced
significant inhibition at doses up to 10 mg/kg (Figures 1-3). CBN
was only marginally active (Table 1.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Delta-1-THC was fully effective only at
concentrations above 10 mg/kg Figure 2).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The ethanolic and petroleum extract, CBD,
olivetol, CBG, and cannflavon were more potent than aspirin. The
petroleum spirit extract was about four times more potent than
the ethanolic extract, which was virtually equipotent with CBD.
Cannflavon, isolated from the ethanolic extract was 14 times less
potent than the ethanolic extract of the dried herb (Table 2).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There was a decline in response following the
administration of doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg of some
substances. This is most evident in the bell shaped dose-response
curve of the petroleum spirit extract (Figure 1). The activity of
the ethanolic extract and CBD was also found to decrease slightly
at higher dose levels. (Figures 1 and 2)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">TPA-Induced Erythema. In general, the ability
of compounds to inhibit TPA-induced erythema correlated well with
their potency in the PBQ-writhing test. Thus, CBN and delta-1-THC
were the least active followed by CBG, CBD, and cannflavon.
Again, the extracts were the most active (Table 3). Twenty-four
hours after application, the ethanolic extract still produced 16%
inhibition of TPA-induced erythema of the animals. All other
substances were without activity after 24 h. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">All substances were more active than
trifluoperazine, 1 mg/5ul, a known phorbol ester antagonist both
in vivo (19) and in vitro (20). &nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">DISCUSSION</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The PBQ-induced writhing response is believed
to be produced by the liberation of endogenous substance(s),
notably metabolites of the arachidonic cascade (21, 22). However,
the PBQ test is not specific for weak analgesics such as the
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, as it also detects centrally
active analgesics (16, 17). Therefore, in the elucidation of the
action of the cannabinoids as inflammatory drugs, it was
necessary to perform more than one test. In this case, peripheral
rather than central action was confirmed in the mouse ear
erythema assay. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">TPA-induced erythema was inhibited by the
extracts cannflavon, cannabinoids, and olivetol. The activity of
TPA has been shown to be dependent upon PG release in mouse
epidermis (23) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (24) possibly via
the initial stimulation of protein kinase C (for a review see
reference 25). It has also been shown that compounds that show
moderate to very potent antiinflammatory potential in standard in
vivo inflammation models will also inhibit TPA-induced edema of
the mouse ear (26), and phorbol-ester-induced erythema (19). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is possible that the cannabinoids and their
extracts are inhibiting both PBQ-induced writhing and TPA-induced
erythema by effects on arachidonate release and metabolism.
Cannabinoids and olivetol have been shown to inhibit PG
mobilization (11, 12) and synthesis (14). The noncannabinoid
constituents of Cannabis, for example, cannflavon, have been
shown to be mainly cyclooxygenase inhibitors (14). Cannabinoids,
however, stimulate and inhibit phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity
(13), as well as inducing an inhibition of cyclooxygenase and
lipoxygenase (14). The activity of Cannabis herb or resin is
complex, in that activities can be demonstrated on at least three
major enzymes of the arachidonate cascade.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The mechanism by which delta-1-THC inhibits
PBQ-induced writhing may differ from that of the other
substances. At concentrations greater than 10 mg/kg, delta-1-THC
may be inhibiting PBQ-induced writhing by acting on central
rather than peripheral functions. It is possible that
prostaglandins modulate certain inhibitory pathways in the brain,
bringing about an increase in the pain threshold. This dose of
delta-1-THC is capable of bringing about the cataleptic effect
(27), which is a standard test for central involvement. Central
analgesics have higher efficacies than peripheral ones, and this
may explain the effectiveness of delta-1-THC (Figure 2). The
central involvement of delta-1-THC is perhaps the primary reason
why delta-1-THC was recognized as an analgesic before other
cannabinoids. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our results suggest that the response of the
ethanolic extract cannot be solely due to cannflavon. Other
structurally related phenolic substances, known to be present in
this complex extract, may account for the higher activity seen
either due to cumulative or synergistic effects upon
cyclooxygenase. The activity of the petroleum ether extract is
likely to be largely due to the presence of CBD and CBN. GLC
analysis of the extract has shown that this extract contained
14.13% CBD, 9.08% CBN, and 6.68% delta-1-THC (27). On the basis
of our results, it is possible to separate the centrally active
cannabinoid delta-1-THC from peripherally active compounds of the
herbal extracts. An attempt has been made to differentiate them
structurally (Table 3). It can be seen that the olivetolic
nucleus together with a free C-5 hydroxyl group are structural
requirements for peripheral effects, involving both
cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibition (14). Substances
possessing this structure possess antiinflammatory and analgesic
activities without central hallucinogenic effects. Delta-1-THC
and CBN, which are cyclized derivatives exhibiting no C-5
hydroxyl moiety, have little if any peripheral action. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The traditional use of Cannabis as an
analgesic, antiasthmatic, and antirheumatic drug is well
established. Our results would suggest that cultivation of
Cannabis plants rich in CBD and other phenolic substances would
be useful not only as fiber-producing plants but also for
medicinal purposes in the treatment of certain inflammatory
disorders.&nbsp;</font></p>

DISEASE&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major nonpsychoactive
cannabinoid of marijuana. Based on reports indicating possible
efficacy of CBD in dystonic movements (Neurology 1984; 34 [Suppl
1]: 147 and 1985; 35 [Suppl 1]: 201), we tried CBD in three
patients with Huntington's disease (HD). The patients;, aged 30
to 56, had HD of 7 to 12 years' duration. Their condition has
been slowly progressive and unresponsive to prior therapy with
neuroleptics. Orally administered CBD was initiated at 300 mg/d
and increased 1 week later to 600 mg/d for the next 3 weeks. Mild
improvement ( 5 to 15%) in the choreic movements was documented
using the tongueprotrusion test (Neurology [Minneap} 1972; 22:
929-33) and a chorea severity evaluation scale (Br J Clin
Pharmacol 1981; 11: 129-51) after the first week. Further
improvement (20 to 40%) was noticed after the second week of CBD,
and this remained stable for the following 2 weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Except for transient, mild hypotension, no side
effects were recorded, and laboratory tests were normal.
Withdrawal of CBD after 48 hours resulted in return of choreic
movements to the pre-CBD state. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Beneficial and Adverse Effects of Cannabidiol
in a Parkinson Patient with Sinemet-Induced Dystonic Dyskinesia</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Stuart R. Snider and Paul Consroe,

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;&quot;Neurology&quot; 35 April 1985
(Suppl 1) p. 201&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In idiopathic dystonia, the therapeutic effect
of marijuana smoking is reported to be comparable with diazepam
(C.D. Marsden, in Disorders of Movement, 1981: 81). The
non-psychoactive cannabis derivative, cannabidiol (CBD), also
improves dystonia (Consroe and Snider, in Cannabinoids as
Therapeutic Agents, in press). We report the effect of CBD on
dystonia secondary to Sinemet in parkinsonism, a disorder thought
to be a relative contraindication for cannabinoids (D. Moss et
al, Pharmacol Biochem Behav 1981, 1984). The patient, a 42
year-old man with an 8-year history of parkinsonism, developed
peak-dose dyskinesia about 4 years ago and action dystonia
affecting all limbs more recently. Trohexyphenidyl and
bromocriptine each produced only slight improvement. To stable
optimal dosages of the three drugs, CBD was added, starting with
100 mg/d and increasing by 100 mg weekly. At 100 to 200 mg/d,
there was a decrease in clinical fluctuations and in dyskinesia
scores (by 30%) without a significant worsening of the
parkinsonism. At 300 to 400 mg/d, there was no further
improvement in the dyskinesia, and adverse effects (dizziness,
increased Parkinson symptoms) appeared. CBD withdrawal resulted
in 3 days of severe generalized dystonia and several weeks of
increased sensitivity to Sinemet, suggestive of a &quot;drug
holiday&quot; effect. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although a variety of pharmacological agents
have been reported to</font></p>

<p><font size="3">attenuate symptoms of Tourette's syndrome (TS),
the pathophysiology of this</font></p>

<p><font size="3">disorder remains unknown. Apart from the
presence of disabling motor and</font></p>

<p><font size="3">vocal tics, TS patients often experience
behavioral disturbances including</font></p>

<p><font size="3">obsessive compulsive thoughts, anxiety,
depression, abnormal sleep</font></p>

<p><font size="3">disturbances. (1) Drug abuse to obtain relief
from the chronic anxiety may</font></p>

<p><font size="3">be common among these patients. (2) (3) We
recently encountered three</font></p>

<p><font size="3">patients with TS who experienced incomplete
responses to conventional</font></p>

<p><font size="3">anti-TS drugs but noted a significant
amelioration of symptoms when smoking</font></p>

<p><font size="3">marijuana.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first patient was a 15-year-old boy who, in
addition to motor</font></p>

<p><font size="3">tics, had obsessive compulsive and
self-mutilatory behavior improved with</font></p>

<p><font size="3">administration of imipramine (37.5 mg/day)
combined with the oral opiate</font></p>

<p><font size="3">receptor antagonist naltrexone (dose range 50
to 100 mg/day). During</font></p>

<p><font size="3">recreational use of marijuana (1 to 2
cigarettes/day), he noted general</font></p>

<p><font size="3">relaxation and marked lessening in his urge to
tic. According to the</font></p>

<p><font size="3">patient's mother, motor tics had decreased by
about 50% and there was also</font></p>

<p><font size="3">some reduction in the frequency of the
self-mutilatory behavior. The</font></p>

<p><font size="3">patients had been smoking marijuana for 4
weeks, and upon discontinuation,</font></p>

<p><font size="3">noted rebound exacerbation of symptoms within
12 hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second patient, age 17, had had severe
motor tics since the age</font></p>

<p><font size="3">of 7 years. He had frequent jerk-type movements
of his neck muscles</font></p>

<p><font size="3">associate with infrequent vocalizations during
stressful situations. His</font></p>

<p><font size="3">management had been difficult as he was unable
to tolerate haloperidol or</font></p>

<p><font size="3">clonidine. Administration of naltrexone (150
mg/day) reduced his anxiety</font></p>

<p><font size="3">level and the urge to tic; this was the only
drug he could tolerate. On</font></p>

<p><font size="3">several occasions, he had smoked marijuana and
noted generalized relaxation</font></p>

<p><font size="3">accompanied by reduction in the severity of the
motor tics and improvement</font></p>

<p><font size="3">in attention span. He volunteered that smoking
one cigarette reduced the</font></p>

<p><font size="3">frequency of his motor tics by about 60% to
70%, which was sustained over</font></p>

<p><font size="3">several hours. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The third patient was a 39-year-old man who had
had symptoms of TS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">since the age of 9 years. His symptoms included
frequent jerking-type</font></p>

<p><font size="3">movements of his neck and upper extremity
muscles, facial grimacing,</font></p>

<p><font size="3">frequent blinking, and leg jerking.
Vocalizations were not noted except</font></p>

<p><font size="3">during extreme anxiety. In addition he was
troubled by chronic insomnia</font></p>

<p><font size="3">and hypersexuality. He reported no benefit from
haloperidol, clonidine, or</font></p>

<p><font size="3">benzodiazepines but experienced some relief
after consuming large amounts</font></p>

<p><font size="3">of ethanol. He also admitted that marijuana
smoking (1/2 to 1</font></p>

<p><font size="3">cigarette/day) produced relaxation with
subsequent reduction in the</font></p>

<p><font size="3">severity of the motor tics along with marked
attenuation of his</font></p>

<p><font size="3">hypersexuality. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">From 1842 to the turn of this century, several
reports in the</font></p>

<p><font size="3">literature have indicated that marijuana
smoking was used extensively as an</font></p>

<p><font size="3">analgesic, sedative, and hypnotic agent. (4)
Moreover, oral cannabis</font></p>

<p><font size="3">preparations were useful in the management of
diverse neurological</font></p>

<p><font size="3">conditions including convulsions and chorea.
(5) Much more recently it was</font></p>

<p><font size="3">reported anecdotally that patients with
dystonia improved with their</font></p>

<p><font size="3">alleged cannabis smoking. (6) The cannabis
constituent cannabidiol was</font></p>

<p><font size="3">reported efficacious in reducing symptoms of
dystonia. (7,8) and</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Huntington's chorea. (9) In experimental
animals, cannabidiol has been</font></p>

<p><font size="3">shown to exert anticonvulsant and antianxiety
properties and affect</font></p>

<p><font size="3">apomorphine-induced turning behavior in rats.
(10) The latter report</font></p>

<p><font size="3">suggested that cannabidiol exerts
antidyskinetic effects through modulation</font></p>

<p><font size="3">of striatal dopaminergic activity.
Tetrahudrocannabinol (THC, the active</font></p>

<p><font size="3">compound of marijuana) may exert GABA-ergic as
well as antiserotonergic</font></p>

<p><font size="3">effects. (11) A recent report has demonstrated
that THC reduces opiate</font></p>

<p><font size="3">receptor binding sites and modulates opiod
receptors in a noncompetitive</font></p>

<p><font size="3">manner. (12) THC may also exert effects on the
cholinergic system. (13)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Considering evidence that marijuana may exert
effects on a large</font></p>

<p><font size="3">number of neurotransmitters, it is difficult to
speculate on its mode of</font></p>

<p><font size="3">action in attenuating symptoms of TS. It is
reasonable to assume that the</font></p>

<p><font size="3">effects of marijuana in TS may be largely
related to its anxiety-reducing</font></p>

<p><font size="3">properties, although a more specific
antidyskinetic effect cannot be</font></p>

<p><font size="3">excluded. Should marijuana compounds prove to
have specific actions in TS,</font></p>

<p><font size="3">chemical modifications which eliminate the
psychoactive properties while</font></p>

<p><font size="5">THERAPEUTIC POSSIBILITIES IN CANNABINOIDS
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">THE LANCET, MARCH 22, 1975 P. 667-69 &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">EDITORIAL &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To early man, Cannabis sativa L. was a source
of food ( hemp seed and oil) and of fibre (ropes), though,
according to mythology, the Emperor Shen Nung (4000 B.C.) knew
that it contained a potent drug. Hindus (20) and Arabs (21) used
it in a medley of diseases, and in Victorian times it had a
therapeutic vogue in Europe. Tincture of cannabis, taken orally,
was occasionally effective as a sedative in psychosomatic
disorders and even for the control of fits, asthma, migraine,
choreiform conditions, and &quot;psychosis.&quot; After a review
by REYNOLDS (22) in 1890, British medicine heard little of the
drug---because of unreliability of available material, the onrush
of chemotherapy by synthetic drugs, and not least the
classification of Cannabis, with opium, as a narcotic in need of
legal restriction.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Herbal cannabis (marihuana or &quot;pot&quot;),
or the resin collected from the flowering tops (hashish), varies
greatly (23) in its content of each active principle or
cannabinoid, but the important ones are tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC, numbered as delta-1 or delta-9, according to the school of
chemistry) and some analogues; cannabinol (CBN); cannabidiol
(CBD)); and cannabigerol (CBG). Synthetic compounds are now being
assessed: an early attempt, demethylheptylpyran (DMHP), is an
anticonvulsant of some potency in man. (24) THC is highly
lipophilic, absorbed rapidly when inhaled and more slowly when
ingested, and is quickly oxidised in stages through an active
metabolite to more polar but inactive products. These are cleared
very slowly from the body in urine and feces. At present cannabis
and the cannbinoids are controlled drugs in the UK, scheduled in
the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971; a personal licence (which can be
obtained readily enough from the Home Office for legitimate
purposes) is required in order to gain exemption from the
provisions of this Act.* </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Among established pharmacological properties of
cannabinoids which may be capable of therapeutic application are
the sedative or tranquillising effect; analgesia; anticonvulsant,
hypothermic, and hypotensive effects; stimulation of appetite;
lowering of intraocular tension; relaxation of smooth muuscle;
and cytotoxic or immunosuppresive actions. There has been
particular interest in the effects on airways. A prolonged and
significant reduction in airways resistance was noted by VACHON
et al. (25) in experienced young males who inhaled 9 litres of
smoke in air from herbal cannabis which contained 1% or 2.6% THC.
Tachycardia and a rise in specific airways conductance followed
at once, the airways effect peaking at 20 minutes and persisting
for some hours. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">TASHKIN et al. (24) confirmed this observation
and estimated that the smoke from cannabis of 2% THC content was
more effective than 1.25 mg of isoprenaline. The next step was to
show that THC in sesame oil was active taken orally in doses of
10-20 mg. The effect took about 1 hour to peak and persisted for
6 hours. TASHKIN et al (27) examined 10 subjects with reversible
airways obstruction of varying severity but whose disability was
quiescent. They were asked to smoke placebo herb, or 7 mg per kg
cannabis of 2% THC content, or to ingest 15 mg of THC. Airways
conductance rose immediately and the effect persisted much longer
than that of isoprenaline. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The two teams have confirmed these results,
(28,29) but there are two minor reservations which may be made
about their work. Firstly, all the subjects tested had previously
smoked marihuana and therefore expected some effect from it,
which may have induced adrenal medullary activity; cannabis-naive
individuals may not respond in this way. Secondly, a highly
sensitive whole-body plethysmograph was used which detects modest
changes in dynamic lung values. With these reservations in mind,
DAVIES et al (30) gave a crude extract of cannabis orally in
ethanol, added to fruit juice immediately before swallowing, to
16 drug-naive patients with reversible airways obstruction. The
extract was analysed by gas / liquid chromatography so that the
dose of THC was known---nil, 2.5 mg, and 10 mg, with 4 mg
salbutamol for comparison. FVC, FEV, PEFR, and MEFR were measured
in addition to self-rating mood scales, blood-pressure,
pulse-rate, and so on. With THC there was a dose-related trend
towards bronchodilation, less than that after salbutamol and not
significantly different from placebo. Further work with higher
dosage is called for. A brief trial of the effect of inhalingl
aerosol-THC failed because the drug is insoluble in water and
poorly soluble in 40% ethanol (which is just tolerable for
inhalation); oil, in which it is soluble, harms the lung. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The best medium may be some non-irritant
smokable carrier. Herbal cannabis is unsuitable because of the
irritant (31) and cytotoxic (32) properties of the smoke. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabinoids inhibit the incorporation of
amino-acids into nucleotides. They are, therefore,
immuno-suppressive and antimitotic; and they inhibit the growth
of Lewis lung cancer in mice. In a pilot trial DAVIES et al. (33)
gave 10 mg oral THC (in alcohol / fruit juice) once daily for
periods of a week to patients with inoperable bronchogenic
carcinoma treated by radiation and who were distressed. A
single-blind crossover pattern was applied, with a week on drug
or placebo followed by a week of rest. There were no very
dramatic changes; the principal effects were drowsiness, improved
sleep, a more relaxed state of mind, reduced demand for
analgesics and hypnotics, and fewer problems of management. The
second was reported by REGELSON and his colleagues (34) at a
symposium at Savannah, Georgia. They gave 0.1 mg per kg THC three
times a day orally in oil to outpatients with inoperable cancer
of several types. Dizziness and drowsiness were troublesome but,
with improved appetite, weight-loss was checked or reversed, and
stress was relieved. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">One of the drawbacks to treatment with THC is
the readiness with which tolerance develops. This may reduce its
efficacy, but THC, or more probably some derivative, may well
find a place as an adjuvant to isoprenaline, since the action on
bronchial smooth muscle differs from that of isoprenaline, or as
an anodyne in the management of terminal carcinoma. &nbsp;</font></p>

PLATELETS INDUCED BY PLASMA FROM MIGRAINE PATIENTS&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary: The effects were assessed of
delta-1-THC* (the psychoactive component of cannabis) and CBD and
DMHP-CBD (the non-psychomimetic components of marijuana
derivatives) on 14C labelled serotonin release from normal
platelets, when incubated with patient's plasma obtained during
migraine attack. A statistically significant inhibitory effect
(p&gt;0.005) of 14C serotonin release was found at 10-5M, 10-6M,
10-7M delta-1-THC concentrations. Plasma of migraine patients
obtained in attack-free periods revealed no significant
inhibitory effect on 14C serotonin release from normal platelets
using the same delta-1-THC concentration. CBD and DMHP-CBD had no
significant effect on 14C serotonin release from normal platelets
when tested either at migraine-free period plasma or plasma
obtained during migraine attack.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;(*Nomenclature for THC is sometimes
different in other countries. delta-1-THC is the same as
delta-9-THC.) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5">Introduction &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Several mechanisms are involved in the
relationship of platelets to migraine attacks. The first relates
to the platelet itself and is associated with hyperaggregation of
platelets (1-5) and their activation (6). On the other hand, a
plasmatic factor has been reported to induce aggregation of
normal human platelets and release serotonin (7-12). Previous
reports on the beneficial effect of cannabinoids in migraine (13)
raises the possibility that delta-1-3, 4-trans
tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-1-THC), the active psychoactive
components of the crude extract of marijuana, may be beneficial
(14, 15). It is a fact that cannabis has an analgesic effect (16)
decreases intraocular pressure (17), has a vasodilatory effect in
bronchial asthma (18) and prevents vomiting (19). These various
effects of cannabinoids and the effect of delta-1-THC on
preventing release of rat brain serotonin induced by reserpin
(20) and its effect on platelets in vivo (21, 22) and aggregation
of platelets in vitro (23) raised the possibility that it might
affect the previously described plasmatic factor in migraine
patients responsible for 14C serotonin release of normal
platelets (8). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Therefore, we assessed that in vitro effect of
three marijuana derivatives: delta-1-THC, the psychoactive
component of cannabis (14) and cannabidiol (CBD) which has no
psychomimetic effect (24). The effect of both drugs might discern
the biological specificity of the marijuana derivatives. Also
(6-hydroxydimethylheptyl) (DMHP-CBD) a homologue of cannabidiol
which increases cannabinoid-activity five hundred-fold was also
investigated (25). &nbsp;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5">Material and methods</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Plasma was obtained from patients, being
followed at the Neurology Clinic of the Ben-Gurion University
Medical Center, and diagnosed according to a standard clinical
definition of migraine (26). Patients refrained from taking drugs
ten days prior to blood donation. Blood samples were obtained (in
plastic tubes --- 3.8% sodium citrate 1:10 volume) once during an
attack-free period and once during a migraine attack.
Simultaneously, samples were obtained from normal controls of the
same age and sex and platelet rich plasma was prepared and frozen
at -72 degrees C. Plasma samples were incubated at 37 degrees C
for ten minutes with the cannabinoids delta-1-THC, CBD and
DMHP-CBD. The concentrations of cannabinoids varied from 10 -7M
to 10 -3M. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ethanol 70% was used as control because it is
used as the solvent for the cannabinoids. It did not affect the
serotonin release during the ten minutes' incubation in
comparison with normal saline. 14C labelled serotonin release was
determined from normal donor's platelets blood group 0 Rh-, who
refrained from taking medications for ten days. The assessment of
14C serotonin release was made with plasma of migraine patients
during an attack, and an attack-free period and of normal plasma
controls according to Hirshman and Schulman (27). Radioactivity
was determined using a liquid Scintillation spectrometer TriCard
3255 Packard. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The results were calculated in percentages,
considering the total radioactivity of 14C serotonin uptake by
the platelets tested as 100% value. Statistical evaluation was
done using the Student's t-test. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5">Results</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Normal plasma incubated with delta-1THC at the
range of concentrations 10 -7M to 10 -3M revealed significant
increases of 14serotonin release from normal platelets only at 10
-4M and 10 -3M delta-1-THC of 106+ 1.9%, 117.9+ 2.3% respectively
(p&lt;0.05). The other two cannabinoid derivatives CBD and
DMHP-CBD had no effect on 14C serotonin release from normal
platelets when incubated with normal plasma, and tested at the
same range of drug concentrations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Table I documents the effect of delta-1-THC,
CBD, and DMHP-CBD on 14C labelled serotonin release from normal
platelets when incubated with the migraine patient's plasma
obtained during a migraine attack. There is a statistically
inhibitory effect of 14C serotonin release (p&lt;0.005) at 10
-5M, 10 -6M, 10 -7M delta-1-THC concentrations. It should be
noted that delta-1-THC added at the same concentrations to plasma
of migraine patients obtained in an attack-free period revealed
no significant inhibitory effect on 14C serotonin release
compared with normal platelets. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The other two cannabinoid derivatives CBD and
DMHP-CBD had no significant inhibitory effect on 14C serotonin
release from normal platelets, when tested either with
migraine-free period plasma or plasma obtained during a migraine
attack. These two derivatives were tested at the same
concentrations as described in Table I. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="5">&nbsp;Discussion</font><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Plasmatic factor present in migraine patients'
plasma was reported to release serotonin in vitro from normal
platelets (7, 8). Serotonin release induced by this factor
occurred in 60-85% of the patients and is presumed to be a fatty
acid (9), prostaglandin (10) or some immunological factor related
to decrease in complement (11, 12). Previous reports concerning
delta-1-THC, the active component in marijuana derivative (14,
28), documented increased serotonin in rats' brains and prevented
release of serotonin induced by reserpine (20). The present
studies documented significant inhibition of 14C serotonin
release from normal platelets in 10 -7M to 10 -5M delta-1-THC
concentrations, when incubated with plasma from migraine patients
( Table I).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It should mention that these concentrations
induce a psychosomatic effect in marijuana smokers and stabilize
red blood cells against lysis (29). It is not clear yet how
cannabinoids affect migraine. Is it due to their analgesic effect
(16), vasoconstrictor effect (30) or preventive effect on
migraine (13)?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The two other non psychomimetic components of
marijuana derivatives CBD and DMHP-CBD did not show inhibition
activity of 14C serotonin release from normal platelets induced
by migraine plasma. It was shown that the psychoactive component
of cannabis delta-1-THC did inhibit 14C serotonin release from
platelets and it might give a clue to the effect of cannabinoids
in vivo in respect of migraine attacks and their inhibition.

APPLICATION</font></p>

Olomucensis--Tom. VI 1955</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Prof. Dr. Jan Kabelik</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 41)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A review of hemp applications -- hemp shoots
and hemp seeds -- taken from ancient herbaria, popular
pharmacology, and the present official pharmacology has been
presented inasmuch as partial recordings of the application of
the cannabis extract have been extant. The author ascertains that
the antibiotic and analgetic effect of the hemp, forgotten in
nowadays medical science, was made use of by our forefathers
particularly. In the following reports no mention is made of the
hashish effect and this for the reason that our hemp does not
possess any stupefying effect. In Europe hashish had been unknown
up to Napoleon's Campaign to Egypt and has been imported from
then on. &nbsp;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT OF CANNABIS INDICA
&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 55-56)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our study of the Mideuropean flora with regard
to its contents of substances producing antibacterial effects
comprehends 3,000 species from which the Indian hemp --- Cannabis
indica --- grown in Czechoslovakia has been selected for
elaborate investigation. A preliminary method of isolation
accomplished by paper chromatography with the disclosure of an
effective zone in the biological way has been described. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most advantageous methods of extraction
were determined, and the bactericide effect of the hemp
substances experimentally proved in vitro on Gram-positive
microorganisms: Staphylococcus pyogenes autreus haemolyticus,
Staphylococcus aureus --- resistant to penicillin, Streptococcus
beta haemolyticus, Streptococcus viridans, Pneumococcus
Cornyebacterium diphteriae, and Bacillus anthracis.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gram-negative microorganisms of the typhus-coli
group remain resistent, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Proteus vulgaris. An excellent antibacterial effect on
Mycobacterium in vitro even in a dilution 1: 150,000 could be
ascertained.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A parallel between the bactericide effect of
isolated, amorphous, and crystal substances, and a comparison of
the sensibility of the two applied bacterial methods, both the
modified Oxford method and the tests in a liquid medium was made
in detail. The limit of efficacy in the maximal dilution of
biologically active substance (1: 100,000) and the velocity of
their effect in various dilutions were determined. The influence
of inactivating factors has been studied in detail. Blood,
plasma, and serum partly inactivate them and reduce their
antibacterial effect.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As a conclusion, a comparison of the efficacy
of these active substance[s] with penicillin and streptomycin at
various pH was worked out, and a summary of hemp preparations
manufactured for the purpose of clinical application in
stomatology, oto-rhino-laryngology, dermatology and phthisiology
has been given.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;PHARMACODYNAMIC EFFECT OF SUBSTANCES
ISOLATED FROM CANNABIS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Summary (p. 71) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A preliminary pharmacologic investigation of
the hemp substances was carried out. It was ascertained that the
isolated hemp extract possesses analgetic, anticonvulsive and
locally anaesthetic properties. Administered to white mice per os
its toxicity was determined with 1.83 g / kg as LD-50.* (*Ed.
note...LD-50 ratio of 18,300: 1 for a concentrated extract.) Acid
II and the acetylderivative of the canabidiol-acid --- pure
substances obtained from hemp do not possess these pharmacologic
properties. All the investigated substances were observed to
bring forth local irritations. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Further studies will have to explain this
irritative effect with regard to the fact that the extract from
the drogue, (sic) when being deprived of a part of its ballast
substances only, does not show to be an irritative factor in
clinical use but, on the contrary, does relieve pain entirely, a
fact having been known to ancient physicians, and nowadays newly
confirmed both by stomatologists and oto-laryngologists. &nbsp;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">THERAPEUTICAL RESULTS IN STOMATOLOGY AFTER
APPLICATION OF SUBSTANCES OBTAINED FROM CANNABIS INDICA &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 77-78) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis substances were applied either in the
form of a 5% hempsalve with lanolin, or they were used in the
form of alcohol extracts for mouth sprayes. (sic) The application
of these substances shows significant positive results in the
treatment of herpes labialis, paradental painful gum pockets, gum
capuches over the wisdom teeth, dry sockets, aphthae and ulcerous
gingivostomatitis. More than five hundred patients were subjected
to this treatment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cannabis substances found their application to
practical advantage mixed with sterile tooth-powder for the
treatment and maintainance of a vital tooth pulp. This was done
in cases of indirect covering of the tooth pulp (about 300
patients -- 80 of whom were reexamined), and in those of direct
covering (about 70 cases -- with 15 patients reexamined). Even
here quick analgesia was considered to be the positive effect. In
two patients, direct covering was experienced with teeth destined
for extraction beforehand, and the extraction performed a certain
time thereafter and the teeth studied histologically. For general
therapeutical use, it is suggested to verify these methods in
further cases or, eventually, to find methods of a more suitable
aplication of cannabis substances in direct or indirect covering
of the tooth pulp. &nbsp;</font></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">APPLICATION OF THE CANNABIS INDICA EXTRACT IN
PRESERVING STOMATOLOGY&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 81-82) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 64% of patients with deep dental caries
incidence, and in more than 30% cases of casually opened or
irritated tooth-pulp, and finally in 41% of persons suffering
from pulpitis partialis positive response could be observed when
treated with cannabis paste. This result corresponds to the
analogous number obtained on application of the Lezovic-paste.
(Paste containing a high ratio of streptomycin, penicillin,
tricresol or benzocaine respectively.) The anaesthetic effect of
cannabis has been attested: in numerous cases with negative
response to therapy painlessness lasting for several days could
be attained, in many patients painless necrosis could be
achieved. In a number of cases the failure was due to an
unsuitable vehicle that did not liberate the antibioticum in the
right proportion. (The same vehicle as with the Lezovic-paste was
made use of.) Future research work will have to include further
clinical control, histological investigations and the search for
a more proper vehicle.) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><font size="3">STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF CANNABIS INDICA IN
OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 85)&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A positive response due to antibiotics obtained
from hemp could be observed in patients with otitis, ulcers of
the anterior narines, and furuncular otitis. With chronical
otitis positive results could be obtained in most cases --
failure, however, in patients with pyocyaneum and proteus
infections. The most striking effect could be observed with
sinusitis, particularly with both-sided sinusitis maxillaris when
one side had been treated with penicillin on control with
negative result, whilst the other side had been healed by three
punctures of hemp extract. The sinus resultlessly treated wit
penicillin showed an immediate positive response to hemp
thereafter. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">EFFECTIVENESS OF CANNABIS INDICA ON CHRONIC
OTITIS MEDIA</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;Summary (p. 89) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Local application of cannabis indica was
experienced in 18 patients suffering from chronic otitis media,
and in 4 patients after mastoidectomy. A significant improvement
was noticed in 13 cases of chronic otitis. Up to the present, our
experiences are of a rather short time, i.e., of three weeks
only. It will be necessary to test cannabis with other more
proper vehicles that would gradually liberate antibiotica on a
satisfactory scale. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE LOCAL EFFECT OF
CANNABIS INDICA --- A REMEDY FOR SPECIFIC FISTULAS &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary ( p. 92) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The reported results of our preliminary
investigations made it possible to establish that specific
fistulas respod positively to hemp extracts, except the cases
brought about by pyocyaneum infection. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">IMPORTANCE OF HEMPSEEDS IN THE TUBERCULOSIS
THERAPY &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary (p. 106-107) &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The application of the hempseed in the
tuberculosis therapy is based on a thirty years' experience
acquired with regard to diet at the sanatorium in Jince. The
right function of the liver has always been considered by the
authors as the necessary supposition for complete assimilation:
that is why those commands and limitations, nowadays known as the
fundamental rules of a liver diet, have been stressed. To a
certain extent, we consider it to be the universal base of every
diet therapy. Next to the vitamins B-1, C and A the tuberculosis
diet must contain protein substances above all and among those
particularly such as got from nature the faculty to yield
building material for the construction of the organism. Such are
especially curd, egg-yolk and spare protein substances contained
in corn, nuts and other fruits. It is essential to get these
proteins prepared without their being denatured. Curd prepared in
an expert way becomes a precious dietetic, it is worthless in its
tough or coagulated from. Analgous observations can be made with
raw or hard boiled egg-yolks. A daily dose of only 15 or 20 g of
oatflakes in the form of porridge prepared in an expert way
proves to be a highly effective substance in a short time,
whereas twenty times as much cereals denatured by baking or
boiling in water, show to be a mere indifferent foodstuff. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ground hempseeds extracted by milk at a
temperature from 60 to 80 degrees C. prove to be analogically ---
even in their smallest doses --- an utmost effective remedy. The
mouldable organism of the consumptive child is a good criterion
for such a diet, eked out with hempseeds. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Summary. The chronic motor handicaps of a
30-year-old multiple sclerosis patient acutely improved while he
smoked a marihuana cigarette. This effect was quantitatively
assessed by means of clinical rating, electromyographic
investigation of the leg flexor reflexes and electromagnetic

<p><font size="3">This study was prompted by a young man with
multiple sclerosis (MS) who used marihuana as a remedy for his
various motor, micturition and sexual handicaps. After smoking a

since 1983. At the time of our experiments he was bound to a
wheelchair because of severe limb and gait ataxia and spastic
tetraparesis. After micturition, his residual urine volume was
100-150 ml. He complained of impotence, with erections lasting
less than 5 min and lacking ejaculation. He tried a marihuana
cigarette in about 1984 and noted an instantaneous improvement of
his motor and sexual functions lasting for several days. Since
then, he regularly took some marihuana biscuits each week, which
enabled him to climb stairs, to walk on even ground, and to have
erections for more than 30 min. allowing him a quite satisfactory
sexual life. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Methods &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&gt;From 12 October 1985 the patient abstained
from all drugs, including marihuana. He was hospitalized between
17 October and 25 October. On 22 October, one
&quot;experimental&quot; marihuana cigarette was allowed, and
various electrophysiological experiments were performed as
described below. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Clinical rating was performed daily by the same
neurologist and on 22 October before and after the
&quot;experimental&quot; cigarette. Rating comprised motor
functions relevant to the electrophysiological tests described
below (see Fig. 1).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The flexor reflex was elicited by a painful
electrical shock to the foot sole and recorded from the
quadriceps (Q), posterior biceps (PB), gastrocnemius (G) and
tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. The EMG was full-wave rectified,
and eight consecutive reflexes were summated. Five control series
of eight consecutive reflexes were run at intervals of about 5
min. The patient was then asked to take one whiff of his
&quot;experimental&quot; cigarette, and further series of
reflexes were run in the manner described above (for details see
[12]).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Finger movements were recorded in a
standardized pointing task performed before and after both the
&quot;experimental&quot; cigarette and the flexor reflex
experiment. Basically, the recording device consisted of a
three-coil-transmitter system generating non-homogeneous magnetic
fields, and a miniaturized receiver coil attached to the finger
tip. When the finger moved through the magnetic fields a signal
was induced in the receiver coil, allowing the computation of the
two-dimensional movement trajectory (for details see [15]). Ten
trials were performed before and after marihuana smoking, each
consisting of a pointing movement of the right index finger over
a 10-cm distance. The forearm rested on a stable support, but the
finger and hand could not reach the target. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Results &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Clinical rating showed a moderate deterioration
of motor functions between 17 October and 22 October (Fig. 1) On
22 October, before the &quot;experimental&quot; cigarette, he was
incapable of walking a few steps even with support: his muscle
force in the legs did not exceed MRC grade 3. Muscle tone ranged
between slightly and moderately increased, and the leg deep
tendon reflexes were exaggerated or clonic with sustained ankle
and knee clonus. The receptive field of the Babinski sign covered
the whole foot and the shin. Ataxia in the arms was severe and
could not be tested in the legs because of distinct hip flexor
paresis. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">About 145 min after the marihuana cigarette,
muscle force was somewhat increased in the knee extensors and
ankle flexors (but not in the hip flexors), and muscle tone was
reduced. The leg deep tendon reflexes showed normalization, too,
corresponding to a clear shortening of the periods of clonus. The
receptive field of the Babinski sign was confined to the lateral
foot sole margin. Ataxia in finger-nose testing was moderate.
After the flexor reflex experiment, the patient was able to walk
a few metres between the couch and his wheelchair with support.
Some of these improvements lasted beyond 23 October and even 24
October (Fig 1). &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The flexor reflex showed the desynchronized and
prolonged reflex pattern typical of spastic paresis (Fig. 2a: cf
[13]). As soon as 2 min after the whiff of the marihuana
cigarette, a clear attenuation of the reflex activity was noted.
Attenuation was about equal in all four muscles (20%-30% of the
last three control recordings) and progressed until 17 min after
the whiff. A second whiff (18 min after the first one) did not
induce further reflex attenuation. Single sweep recordings showed
that the reflex attenuation after marihuana was not due to
enhanced habituation;: after marihuana even the first of the
eight consecutive reflex responses was attenuated. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Electromagnetic recording of action tremor
revealed a coarse 3 Hz hand and finger tremor with an amplitude
between 1 and 3 cm, persisting throughout nearly the whole
movement. Hours after the &quot;experimental&quot; cigarette,
action tremor was almost completely abolished, although the
movements were made at about the same speed (Fig. 2b).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Discussion&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our findings clearly show that there are indeed
motor actions of marihuana which were (a) reproducible in a
laboratory situation most exhaustive to the patient. (b)
quantitatively assessable by means of electrophysiological
testing, and (c) in line with the results of clinical rating. Our
findings further correspond with earlier anecdotal clinical
reports [4, 6, 11, 14]. Little is known about the
neurophysiological background of the antispastic and antiataxic
actions of marihuana seen in our patient. However, some findings
in experimental animals seem relevant to our observations.
Cannabinoids in higher dosages attenuate the monosynaptic reflex
[1,2,17,18] principally corresponding to the attenuation of both
deep tendon reflexes and clonus in our patient (Fig. 1).
Polysynaptic reflexes were also attenuated after
tetrahydrocannabinol derivatives in experimental animals [1, 7,
20], fitting in well with the narrowing of the receptive field of
the Babinski sign (Fig. 1) and with the results of our flexor
reflex experiment. As cannabinoids have analgesic properties
[16,20], attenuation of the pathological flexor reflex in the
present case could represent analgesic rather than antispastic
effects of the drug. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">However, analgesic effects are also attributed
to several antispastic drugs [10,21] and, on the other hand,
classical analgesics such as opioids may improve spastic symptoms
[19]. One might, therefore, indeed wonder whether both the
antispastic and analgesic actions of such drugs are in fact at
least to a substantial degree based on common neuronal mechanisms
such as an increase of presynaptic inhibition or a decrease of
postsynaptic excitation of multireceptive interneurones at
various levels of the neuraxis. Whatever the mechanism, the
antispastic actions of marihuana in both clinical rating and
electrophysiological testing are similar to those seen in spastic
patients after either 0.3 mg tizanidine [13], 150 mcg clonidine,
or 10 mg diazepam (unpublished observations). The important
difference is that marihuana apparently also has antiataxic
actions (Fig. 2b: see also [4] not ascribed to any antispastic
drug. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The biochemical basis of the motor effects of
marihuana is obscure. Available data, although somewhat
controversial, suggest that cannabinoids release brain serotonin
from its storage sites and block its re-uptake [8], inhibit the
synthesis of prostaglandins within the CNS [9] and-- in large
doses -- elevate brain acetylcholine and reduce its utilization
[5]. The relationship of these neurotransmitters to spasticity
and ataxia is unknown: none of the well-established antispastic
drugs is thought to interfere with them; they are only scarcely,
if at all, found within the cerebellum [3].</font></p>

<p><font size="3">TREATMENT OF HUMAN SPASTICITY WITH
DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Denis J. Petro, M.D., and Carl Ellenberger,
Jr., M.D. Bronx, NY</font></p>

<p><font size="3">J Clin Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 413S--416S</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Abstract: Spasticity is a common neurologic
condition in patients with multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral
palsy or an injured spinal cord. Animal studies suggest that THC
has an inhibitory effect on polysynaptic reflexes. Some spastic
patients claim improvement after inhaling cannabis. We tested
muscle tone, reflexes, strength and performed EMGs before and
after double-blinded oral administration of either 10 or 5 mg THC
or placebo. The blinded examiner correctly identified the trials
in which the patients received THC in seven of none cases. For
the group, 10 mg THC significantly reduced spasticity by clinical
measurement (P&lt;0.01). Quadriceps EMG interference pattern was
reduced in those four patients with primarily extensor
spasticity. THC was administered to eight other patients with
spasticity and other CNS lesions. Responses varied, but benefit
was seen in three of three patients with &quot;tonic
spasms.&quot; No benefit was noted in patients with cerebellar
disease. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Several patients with multiple sclerosis
reported to us that their spasticity improved after smoking
marihuana. Preliminary uncontrolled observations of these
patients before and after inhalation of the drug suggested to us
that the improvement in spasticity was a specific effect of the
marihuana and not merely a result of the well-recognized euphoria
or altered perception experienced by social users of the drug. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Methods</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We entered nine patients with spasticity,
presumably of spinal origin and related to multiple sclerosis,
into a double-blinded pilot study. The blinded observer examined
each patient on three separate days, before and at 1 1/2-hour
intervals after oral administration of a capsule containing
either 10 mg, 5 mg, or no synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC). Absorption of oral THC is variable, about 90 per cent, but
generally slower than that of inhaled THC. Blood levels and
psychologic effects peak at 3 hours after ingestion. Because
blood level determination is costly and may be unreliable, we did
not determine levels. The examiner rated deep tendon reflexes,
muscular resistance to stretch in the legs, and abnormal reflexes
each on a scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (abnormally increased) and
tabulated the total divided by the number of observations as the
&quot;spasticity score&quot; at 1 1/2 -hour intervals. For
example, if both knee jerks were 3+, both ankle jerks were 3+,
and both adductor jerks were 3+, the total was 18 and the
spasticity score was 18/6= 3.0. Babinski signs were rated as 4+,
their absence as 3+. The examiner viewed the EMG interference
pattern of the quadriceps muscle as the knee joint was flexed
from 0 to 90 degrees at varying velocities. The examiner also
assessed walking ability, inquired about the patient's subjective
response and side effects of the drug, and measured vital signs.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Results</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Three patients reported feeling
&quot;loose&quot; and better able to walk after receiving either
5 or 10 mg THC. The changes in spasticity scores for the treated
and placebo groups are illustrated in Fig. 1. Differences between
the groups at 180 minutes are significant (P&lt;0.01); summed
scores for the two treated groups differed significantly from
summed scores of the placebo group (P&lt;0.005). The spasticity
scores of four patients improved more than two standard
deviations from the mean after either 5 or 10 mg THC; one patient
improved after placebo. Only two of the three patients who felt
improved actually did so by objective criteria. On the basis of
the spasticity scores, the blinded examiner identified correctly
the placebo trials in seven of the nine patients. The EMG index
of spasticity proved to be impractical in five patients---in
three because resistance to stretch was too severe and in two
because electrical activity was too little to record. Among the
remaining four patients, the interference pattern, by visual
inspection, was reduced after treatment from the pretreatment
pattern at comparable velocity of stretch. Side effects of the 5-
or 10-mg oral dosage were minimal. One patient reported feeling
&quot;high&quot; after 10 mg, and another reported a
&quot;high&quot; after placebo. No other patients reported side
effects at the relatively low doses we used. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Discussion</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Our preliminary results suggest that THC or one
of its synthetic derivatives warrants further study as a
potential treatment for spasticity. Although many previous
investigators have studied the effects of marihuana on complex
motor tasks, we were not able to find previous studies of the
effects of marihuana on spasticity in the medical literature.
Experimental studies in animals suggest that THC has an
inhibitory effect on polysynaptic reflexes mediated through the
spinal cord. The results of differential sectioning of the
neuraxis in cats by Dagirmangian and Boyd (1) suggest that the
ability of several tetrahydrocannabinols to decrease polysynaptic
flexion reflexes relates to its action in the region between the
mesencephalon and first cervical segment. Kayaalp et al. (2)
postulate that THC has an effect on both nerve conduction and
skeletal muscle contraction. Sullivan (3) and colleagues found a
dose-dependent loss of reflexes and muscular weakness in dogs.
Although THC has proved to be clinically useful in the treatment
of nausea induced by cancer chemotherapy and in reducing
intraocular pressure in glaucoma, the results of these trials
have demonstrated several disadvantages of the drug. The first is
its potential for psychologic effects that limits usage in higher
doses than those we employed. The second drawback to regular
clinical use of the drug and of its many derivatives is the
observation that many of its therapeutic effects may diminish
after a relatively short period of regular usage. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Discussion of the Paper</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Nahas: Were the subjects that you studied
naive toward marijuana, and did you observe tolerance?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Petro: All of our patients were naive to
marijuana. Anecdotally, other patients claim that they have been
using marijuana for periods up to 15 years for control of
spasticity, but research needs to cover a larger and better
controlled sample before any definitive statement would be
possible. No chronic studies have been done to evaluate drug
tolerance in spasticity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Ungerleider: Did you, as blinded examiner,
interview the patients and perform the tests?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Petro: I did all of the evaluations of
neurologic function.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Ungerleider: Did you know that they felt
better before you evaluated them objectively?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Petro: No; I used only objective measures,
the EMG criteria and the spasticity scores. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Lindblom: Have you considered the use of
patients other than those with multiple sclerosis (MS)? We
studied the effect of baclofen on spasticity, and found much
spontaneous variability in MS patients. In addition, some are
euphoric from the disease and cannabis might add to the euphoria
and confuse the results with unspecific effects. Furthermore,
there are several types of spasticity, and in the case of
baclofen, we found that gamma-spasticity was reduced but
alpha-spasticity was unaffected. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Petro: We had a population of MS patients
that was rather large and readily accessible. Certainly, in
subjects with significant cerebellar disease, marijuana (or its
derivatives) would appear to be contra-indicated because of
relaxant effects. We examined the patient population readily
available for study, which was MS patients, but as you suggest
this is not the ideal group to study. Dr. Gilbert: Poly-synaptic
reflexes in the dog are very sensitive to THC. In the
morphine-dependent animal during abstinence there is an increased
activity in the hind limbs. That activity can be blocked with
very low doses of THC, nantradol and nabilone, before we see any
other effects of the drugs (see Gilbert et al., this monograph).
Dr. Dow: Could you elaborate on your conclusion that THC is not
the ideal drug for spasticity?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Dr. Petro: Patients that report effects from
marijuana don't like taking THC; after smoking a marijuana
cigarette, they clearly have an improvement that is different
from that seen from THC. As other related substances with more
specific CNS effects become available, these should be studied
;in the treatment of spasticity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ulcerative Colitis and Marijuana</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Annals of Internal Medicine, Volume 112, Number
6, 15 March, 1990, p. 471</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To the Editor: The apparent protective effect
of cigarette smoking on ulcerative colitis (1) suggests that
inhaled plant products might affect the disease process. We
report a case suggesting a relation between ulcerative colitis
and smoking marijuana. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1972, a 23-year-old woman developed
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Sigmoidoscopy to
15 cm revealed diffuse cobblestone ulcerations, and a
single-contrast barium enema showed numerous small marginal
irregularities in the distal sigmoid and rectum. Ulcerative
colitis was diagnosed, and her symptoms waxed and waned despite
treatment with sulfasalazine, librax, and intermittent
prednisone. Discouraged, she stopped all medications in 1975. In
1976, she noted that smoking marijuana resulted in fewer stools,
more stable body weight, and fewer, milder exacerbations . Her
typical intake was a pipeful once or twice daily, which she
maintained despite her dislike for its euphoric effects.
Cessation repeatedly resulted in exacerbations within a few
weeks; resumption led to some improvement in a day or two, with
maximal effect after several weeks. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">She was smoking marijuana daily when, after
having 2 months of symptoms, she was hospitalized at the Mary
Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1983. She was febrile and had an
erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 103 mm/h. Sigmoidoscopy to 16
cm showed diffuse small friable ulcerations with granularity. A
biopsy of the lower rectal fold showed marked chronic
inflammation extending into the submucosa without granulomas. She
improved promptly with prednisone. At home she resumed taking
marijuana. Over 15 months her prednisone dose was tapered and
sulfasalazine therapy begun. Sigmoidoscopy to 20 cm was normal,
and a single-contrast barium enema showed a diffuse granular
pattern with a &quot;pipe-like&quot; apearance, compatible with
inactive colitis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1986 she stopped both sulfasalazine and
marijuana but within 2 months became symptomatic. Sulfasalazine
was resumed with minimal relief, and 2 months later she resumed
taking marijuana. Her symptoms improved within about a week, and
in 2 months she was again in remission through 1988. The patient
had started smoking cigarettes before the onset of the ulcerative
colitis. She noted no relation to her symptoms and stopped
smoking in 1982 for &quot;health reasons.&quot; She thought her
symptoms worsened with coffee or alcohol and rarely drank either
beverage. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This case suggests marijuana may ameliorate
ulcerative colitis, although an alternative explanation is the
natural variation in the severity of its symptoms. It is not
clear how tobacco or marijuana might have a beneficial effect.
Suggested mechanism for cigarettes include enhanced catecholamine
release, disturbed prostaglandin production, and immunologic
changes (1). Cigarettes increase colonic motility and marijuana
in large doses may cause diarrhea (2), although it is difficult
to relate these observations to ulcerative colitis. A few
systemic effects are similar for both drugs. Both have been
associated with T-cell suppression (3), but the relation of
ulcerative colitis with immune disturbances is weak (4).
Interference with the pituitary-ovarian axis can occur from
either drug (2, 5); for tobacco, this interference seems to cause
relative estrogen deficiency in women (5). Through effects on
estrogen receptors in the colon or changes in bile composition,
such hormonal changes could conceivably affect the colon. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although an ameliorative effect of marijuana
smoking on ulcerative colitis, if verified, would probably have
little direct clinical relevance, it might lead to new therapy
and help elucidate the disease. </font></p>

<p>OPINION BY: BUCKLEY</p>

<p>OPINION:<b> [*1132]</b> BUCKLEY, Circuit Judge:</p>

<p>The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the Drug Policy
Foundation, and the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana<b> [*1133]</b> Laws petition for review of a final
order of the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration
declining to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II
of the Controlled Substances Act. Rescheduling to Schedule II
would permit doctors to prescribe marijuana<b> [**2]</b> for
therapeutic purposes. Petitioners&#146; central claim is that the
Administrator&#146;s order rests on an unreasonable
interpretation of the statute. Because our previous disposition
of this matter in <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA,
289 U.S. app. D.C. 214, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991) </i>(&#147;ACT&#148;)
constitutes the law of the case, we decline to reconsider this
claim. We also find that the Administrator satisfied ACT&#146;s
mandate on remand and that petitioners&#146; other claims lack
merit.</p>

<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>

<p>A. Statutory Scheme</p>

<p>The Controlled Substances Act (&#147;CSA places hazardous
drugs in five categories, or schedules, which impose varying
restrictions on access to the drugs. See <i>21 U.S.C.  812 </i>(1988).
Marijuana is assigned by statute to Schedule I, the most
restrictive of these. See id. Schedule I drugs may be obtained
and used lawfully only by doctors who submit a detailed research
protocol for approval by the Food and Drug Administration and who
agree to abide by strict record-keeping and storage rules. See
21C.F.R.  1301.33, 1301.42.</p>

<p>The CSA allows the Attorney General to reschedule a drug if he
finds that it does not [**3] meet the criteria for the schedule
to which it has been assigned. <i>21 U.S.C.  811(a). </i>The
Attorney General has delegated this authority to the
Administrator. See 28 C.F.R.  0.100(b). In rescheduling a drug,
the Administrator must consider, inter alia, &#147;scientific
evidence of [the drug&#146;s] pharmacological effect, if
known,&#148; and &#147;the state of current scientific knowledge
regarding the drug or other substance&#148; in determining
whether to reschedule the drug. <i>21 U.S.C.  811(c)(2), (3). </i></p>

<p>A drug is placed in Schedule I if (1) it &#147;has a high
potential for abuse,&#148; (2) it has &#147;no currently accepted
medical use in treatment in the United States,&#148; and (3)
&#147;there is a lack of accepted safety for use of the
drug...under medical supervision.&#148; <i>21 U.S.C.  812(b)(f)</i>
(1988) (emphasis added). The Schedule II criteria are somewhat
different: (1) the drug &#147;has a high potential for
abuse.&#148; (2) it &#147;has a currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical
use with severe restrictions,&#148; and (3) &#147;abuse of the
drug...may lead to severe psychological<b> [**4]</b> or physical
dependence.&#148; <i>21 U.S.C.  812(b)(2)</i> (1988) (emphasis
added). Petitioners&#146; central claim is that the Administrator
misinterpreted the language italicized above.</p>

<p>B. Procedural History</p>

<p>This is the latest chapter in petitioners&#146; efforts to
move marijuana into a less restrictive CSA schedule. They claim
that marijuana is misclassified because it has been shown to
serve various medicinal purposes. Specifically, they content that
marijuana alleviates some side effects of chemotherapy in cancer
patients, aids in the treatment of glaucoma, an eye disease, and
reduces muscle spasticity in patients suffering from multiple
sclerosis and other maladies of the central nervous system. In
support of these contentions, they introduced affidavits and
testimony for a number of patients and practicing physicians who
insist that, in their experience, marijuana has proven safe and
effective.</p>

<p>The petition to reschedule marijuana was first filed in 1972
and has been before this court on four prior occasions--<i>National
Org. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Ingersoll, 162 U.S. App.
D.C. 67, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974); National Org. for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 182 U.S. App
D.C. 114, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977);</i><b><i> </i></b><b>[**5}</b>
National Org. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug
Enforcement Admin. &amp; Dept. of Health, Education &amp;
Welfare, No. 79-1660 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 16, 1980); and most
recently, <i>ACT, 289 U.S. App. D.C. 214, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir.
1991). </i>ACT is the only part of this history we need recount.</p>

<p>In ACT, the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics
(&#147;Alliance&#148;) and the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (&#147;NORML&#148;) argued that the
Administrator&#146;s refusal to reschedule marijuana rested on an
unreasonable interpretation of the statutory phase,
&#147;currently accepted medical use,&#148; <b>[*1134]</b> <i>930
F.2d at 939; see 21 U.S.C.  812</i>(b)(l)(B), (2)(B). In a
scheduling proceeding involving another drug, the Administrator
determined that &#147;the characteristics of a drug or other
substance with an accepted medical use include:</p>

<p>(1) scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry;</p>

<p>(2) the toxicology and pharmacology of the substance in
animals;</p>

<p>(3) establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials;</p>

<p>(4) general availability of the substance <b>[**6]</b> and
information regarding the substance and its use;</p>

<p>(5) recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>(6) specific indications for the treatment of recognized
disorders;</p>

<p>(7) recognition of the use of the substance by organizations
or associations of physicians; and</p>

<p>(8) recognition and use of the substance by a substantial
segment of the medical practitioners in the United States.</p>

<p><i>53 Fed. Reg. 5,156, 5,157-58 </i>(Feb. 22, 1988).</p>

<p>Applying these criteria to the petition to reschedule
marijuana, the Administrator found on December 29, 1989, that
marijuana had no currently accepted medical use and thus had to
remain in Schedule I. <i>54 Fed. Reg. 53,767, 53,768 (1989).</i>
The eight-factor test had been published in the Federal Register
on February 22, 1988, 17 days after the close of the evidence but
before the oral arguments to the administrative law judge in the
marijuana rescheduling proceedings.</p>

<p>On reviewing the Administrator&#146;s decision, we found the
eight-factor test for determining whether a drug had a
&#147;currently accepted medical use&#148; to be <b>[**7]</b>
&#147;in the main acceptable.&#148; <i>ACT, 930 F.2d at 937.</i>
We noted the ambiguity of the phrase and dearth of legislative
history on point and deferred to the Administrator&#146;s
interpretation as reasonable. Id, at 939 (citing <i>Chevron U.S.
A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 387,
843-45, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (</i>1984) (court may
not substitute its own construction of ambiguous statutory
provision for reasonable interpretation by agency of statute
entrusted to its administration)). We were troubled, however, by
three of the eight criteria and remanded the case &#147;for an
explanation as to how [these] had been utilized by the
Administrator in reaching his decision.&#148; <i>930 F.2d at 940.</i>
In particular, we were concerned over the apparent impossibility
of meeting the fourth, fifth, and eighth criteria, all of which
assumed an availability of marijuana for medical purposes that
was prohibited by </p>

<p>Schedule I.</p>

<p>On March 26, 1992, the current Administrator issued the order
that is the subject of this appeal. See <i>57 Fed. Reg. 10,499</i>
(Mar. 26, 1992) (&#147;Final Order&#148;). He concluded, on
remand, that <b>[**8]</b> his predecessor had not in fact relied
on two of the three &#147;impossible&#148; criteria; he explained
the third; and, after applying new criteria, he again denied the
petition to reschedule marijuana. <i>Id. at 10,508.</i></p>

<p>II. DISCUSSION</p>

<p>A. Law of the Case</p>

<p>We held, in ACT, that the Administrator&#146;s interpretation
of the CSA was reasonable. Under the &#147;law of the case&#148;
doctrine, appellate courts do not reconsider matters resolved on
a prior appeal in the same proceeding. </p>

<p>18 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure 4478
at 788 (1981). The doctrine is not a jurisdictional limitation;
rather, it &#147;merely expresses the practice of courts
generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided....&#148;<i>Meseight
criteria and remanded the case &#147;for an explanation as to how
[these] had been utilized by the Administrator in reaching his
decision.&#148; 930 F.2d at 940.</i> In particular, we were
concerned over the apparent impossibility of meeting the fourth,
fifth, and eighth criteria, all of which assumed an availability
of marijuana for medical purposes that was prohibited by </p>

<p>Schedule I.</p>

<p>On March 26, 1992, the current Administrator issued the order
that is the subject of this appeal. See <i>57 Fed. Reg. 10,499</i>
(Mar. 26, 1992) (&#147;Final Order&#148;). He concluded, on
remand, that <b>[**8]</b> his predecessor had not in fact relied
on two of the three &#147;impossible&#148; criteria; he explained
the third; and, after applying new criteria, he again denied the
petition to reschedule marijuana. <i>Id. at 10,508.</i></p>

<p>II. DISCUSSION</p>

<p>A. Law of the Case</p>

<p>We held, in ACT, that the Administrator&#146;s interpretation
of the CSA was reasonable. Under the &#147;law of the case&#148;
doctrine, appellate courts do not reconsider matters resolved on
a prior appeal in the same proceeding. </p>

<p>18 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure 4478
at 788 (1981). The doctrine is not a jurisdictional limitation;
rather, it &#147;merely expresses the practice of courts
generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided....&#148;<i>Messenger
v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444, 56 L. Ed. 1152, 32 S. Ct. 739
(1912).</i> Thus, courts will reconsider previously decided
questions in such exceptional cases as those in which there has
been an intervening change of controlling law, or new evidence
has surfaced, or the previous disposition has resulted in clear
error or manifest injustice. 18 Wright &amp; Miller, 4478 at 790.</p>

<p>Petitioners do not contend that any of these exceptions apply
here. Instead, they assert <b>[**9]</b> that in ACT we gave only
cursory attention the statutory interpretation argument whereas,
in their view, the law of the <b>[*1135]</b> case doctrine
applies only where the prior appeal has analyzed an issue at
length. We disagree on both counts. First, our treatment of the
statutory interpretation question was entirely adequate. Second,
even summarily treated issues become the law of the case. In <i>Christianson
v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 817, 100 L. Ed.
2d 811, 108 S. Ct. 2166 (1988), </i>the Supreme Court noted:
&#147; That the Federal Circuit did not explicate its rationale
is irrelevant, for the law of the case turns on whether a court
previously &#146;decided upon a rule of law&#146;--which the
Federal Circuit necessarily did--not on whether, or how well, it
explained the decision.&#148; In ACT, we decided that it was not
&#148;an unreasonable application of the statutory phrase [for
the Administrator] to emphasize the lack of exact scientific
knowledge as to the chemical effects of the drug&#146;s
elements.&#148; <i>930 F.2d at 939.</i></p>

<p>As noted above, our only concern, in ACT, was with three of
the standards adopted by the Administrator and his possible
reliance on them. As a consequence, <b>[**10]</b> in remanding
the case, we asked him to explain how his decision had been
affected by those standards. In the Final Order, the present
Administrator found that two of these criteria--the &#147;general
availability of the substance&#148; and the &#147;use of the
substance by a substantial segment of ... medical
practitioners&#148;--played no role in his predecessor&#146;s
decision. See <i>57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.</i></p>

<p>Further, the Administrator found that his predecessor&#146;s
conclusion that marijuana failed to meet the third of the
questioned criteria--&#148;recognition of [the drug&#146;s]
clinical use in generally accepted pharmacopeia&#148;--rested on
a determination that marijuana lacked a known, reproducible
chemistry. See id. We had objected to the &#147;recognition of
clinical use&#148; standard only because it seemed to require
widespread therapeutic use of the drug--an impossibility for
Schedule I substances. See <i>ACT, 930 F.2d at 940</i>. The
Administrator&#146;s interpretation of that criterion meets our
objection.</p>

<p>The Final Order discards the earlier formulation and applies a
new five-part test for determining whether a drug is in
&#147;currently accepted medical use&#148;:</p>

<p>(1) The <b>[**II]</b> drug&#146;s chemistry must be known and
reproducible</p>

<p>(2) there must be adequate safety studies;</p>

<p>(3) there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving
efficacy;</p>

<p>(4) the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and </p>

<p>(5) the scientific evidence must be widely available.</p>

<p><i>57 Fed. Reg. at 10,506.</i> None of these criteria is
impossible for a Schedule I drug to meet; in fact, petitioners
concede in their briefs that the new standard has corrected the
flaws we identified in ACT.</p>

<p>B. Petitioners&#146; Other Arguments</p>

<p>Petitioners make two additional arguments: (1) They assert
that they were deprived of the opportunity to confirm their
evidentiary submissions to the governing legal standard because
the previous Administrator had failed to publish the eight-factor
test on which he relied, as required by the Freedom of
Information Act (&#147;FOIA&#148;), <i>5 U.S.C.  552(a)(I)(D)</i>,
until two weeks after the close of the evidence in the
rescheduling proceeding; and (2) they claim that the
Administrator&#146;s ruling was not the produce of reasoned
decisionmaking because he was biased and ignored the record.</p>

<p>While <b>[**12]</b> Alliance and NORML had apparently raised
these issues in ACT, we did not expressly address them; nor did
we decide them by necessary implication because our limited
remand in ACT could have reflected a decision to postpone
consideration of these remaining arguments. Accordingly, we
conclude that ACT did not establish the law of the case as to
these issues. See <i>Bouchet v. Nat&#146;l Urban League, 235 U.S.
App. D.C. 37, 730 F.2d 799, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1984)</i> (&#147; Only
when an issue not expressly addressed must have been decided by
&#146;necessary implication&#146; will the [law of the case]
doctrine be applied ...&#148;).</p>

<p>1. The FOIA Claim</p>

<p>Section 552(a)(1) of FOIA provides in relevant part:</p>

<p><b>[*1136]</b> Each agency shall separately state and
currently published in the Federal Register for the guidance of
the public--</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>(D) ... statements of general policy or interpretations of
general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely
notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner ...
be adversely affected by [] a matter required to be published in
the Federal Register and not so published. <b>[**13]</b></p>

<p><i>5 U.S.C.  552(a)(1) </i>(emphasis added). This provision
requires agencies to set out in advance the legal standards that
will be<i> </i>applied so that &#147;actions can be guided, and
strategies planned.&#148; <i>Northern Calif. Pwr.Agency v.
Morton, 396 F. Supp. 1187, 1191 </i>(D.D.C.), aff&#146;d mem.
sub. nom. <i>Northern Calif. Pwr. Agency v. Kleppe, 176 U.S. App.
D.C. 241, 539 F.2d 243 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</i> To establish a claim
under the statute, however, the litigant must show that &#147;he
was adversely affected by a lack of publication or that he would
have been able to pursue an alterative course of conduct&#148;
had the information been published. <i>Zaharakis v. Heckler, 744
F.2d 711, 714 (9th Cir. 1984).</i></p>

<p>Petitioners argue that the Administrator violated the statute
by using the eight-factor test to evaluate the evidence presented
in the marijuana rescheduling petition. As the test was not
published until 17 days after the close of the evidence, they
contend that they were &#147;adversely affected&#148; by the
Administrator&#146;s reliance on the test because they had no
opportunity to tailor their evidence to meet its requirements. <b>[**14]</b>
Accordingly, they ask us to remand the case to the Administrator
with instructions to reopen the record for the submission of new
evidence.</p>

<p>We decline to do so because petitioners have failed to
demonstrate that they have in fact been adversely affected by the
lack of notice. During the nearly two years between the
publication of the eight-factor test on February 22, 1988, and
the Administrator&#146;s ruling on December 29, 1989, petitioners
never sought to reopen the record. As parties to an important
controversy, they had a responsibility to proffer any evidence
that was made newly relevant by the adoption of the criteria.
Their failure to do so suggests either that they were satisfied
that the evidence already presented would meet the test or that
they had no further evidence to offer. </p>

<p>Thus, we have no reason to believe that petitioners would have
pursued an &#147;alternative course of conduct&#148; had the test
been published earlier. <i>Zaharakis, 744 F.2d at 714.</i> </p>

<p>Furthermore, we do not agree that <i>McLouth Steel Products v.
Thomas, 267 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 838 F.2d 1317 (D.C. Cir. 1988) </i>supports
their position. That case is distinguishable. McLouth arose <b>[**15]</b>
in the context of a rulemaking in which an agency failed to
identify adequately a key standard in its notice of proposed
rulemaking in violation of <i>5 U.S.C.  553</i>. Unlike
petitioners, the McLouth challengers knew the governing legal
standard by the time they were called on to submit evidence;
their complaint was that they had not had a chance to challenge
the standard at the time it was adopted. <i>838 F.2d at 1322-23</i>.
We held that the challengers were not required to demonstrate
that the failure of notice had caused &#147;specific
prejudice&#148; because &#147;we cannot say with certainty
whether petitioners&#146; comments would have had some effect [on
the adoption of the standard] if they had been considered when
the issue was open.&#148; Id, at 1323-24. Here, petitioners&#146;
challenge is not to the standard but to their claimed inability
to respond to it.</p>

<p>2. The Reasoned Decisionmaking Claim</p>

<p>In ACT, Alliance and NORMAL argued that the prior
Administrator had been biased and ignored the record. On this
appeal, petitioners repeat these claims and accuse his successor
of the same errors. We need not consider <b>[**16]</b> whether
the previous Administrator&#146;s ruling stemmed from reasoned
decisionmaking, however, because we remanded it to the agency. We
thus confine our review to the current Administrator&#146;s
treatment of the record in the Final Order.</p>

<p>In support of their bias claim, petitioners point to what they
describe as a long history of the Drug Enforcement
Administration&#146;s <b>[*1137]</b> anti-marijuana prejudice as
evidenced by this court&#146;s need to remand their petition on
four occasions and what they describe as the prior
Administrator&#146;s &#147;unusually strident decision&#148;
rejecting the administrative law judge&#146;s recommendation that
the drug be rescheduled. They also cite various statements by the
present Administrator in the Final Order as evidence of a lack of
objectivity. See, e.g., <i>57 Fed. Reg. at 10,502</i> (&#147;The
only favorable evidence that could be found by [petitioners]
consists of stories by marijuana users&#148;); id. (&#147;sick
people are not objective scientific observers, especially when it
comes to their own health.&#148;); <i>id. at 10,503</i>
(&#147;sick men, women, and children can be fooled by these
claims and experiment with the drug..<i>..</i>It is a cruel hoax
to offer <b>[**17] </b>false hope to desperately ill
people.&#148;)</p>

<p>We are not impressed. The need to remand a case several times
is not evidence per se of agency prejudice. Nor do we think the
statements cited by petitioners show that the Administrator was
unfair, especially when considered in the context of a reasonable
preference for rigorous scientific proof over anecdotal evidence,
even when reported by respected physicians. </p>

<p>Moreover, our review of the record convinces us that the
Administrator&#146;s findings are supported by substantial
evidence. See <i>21 U.S.C.  877</i>(1988) (substantial evidence
standard applies to findings of fact in rescheduling
proceedings). The Final Order canvasses the record at length. It
recites the testimony of numerous experts that marijuana&#146;s
medicinal value has never been proven in sound scientific
studies. The Administrator reasonably accorded more weight to the
opinions of these experts than to the anecdotal testimony of
laymen and doctors on which petitioners relied. The Administrator
noted that with one exception, none of [these doctors] could
identify under oath the scientific studies they swore they relied
on. Only one had enough <b>[**18]</b> knowledge to discuss the
scientific technicalities involved. Eventually, each one admitted
he was basing his opinion on anecdotal evidence, on stories he
heard from patients and on his impression about the drug.</p>

<p>Final order, <i>57 Fed. Reg. at 10,502-03</i>. These findings
are consistent with the view that only rigorous scientific proof
can satisfy the CSA&#146;s &#147;currently accepted medical
use&#148; requirement. <i>Id at 10,500.</i></p>

<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>

<p>For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review are </p>

<p>Denied.</p>

<p>Marijuana Scheduling Petition;</p>

<p>Denial of Petition; Remand</p>

<p>AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration</p>

<p>ACTION: Final Rule</p>

<p>SUMMARY: This is the final rule of the Administrator of the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) concluding the plant
material marijuana has no currently accepted medical use and
denying the petition of the National Organization for Reform of
Marijuan a Laws (NORML) to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I
to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Office of Congressional and
Public Affairs, </p>

<p>202-307-7363.</p>

<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>On December 21, 1989, the former Administrator of DEA,
following rulemaking on the record, which included a hearing
before an administrative law judge, issued a final order
concluding the plant material marijuana has no currently accepted
medical use, and denying the petition of NORML to reschedule
marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled
Substance Act. 54 FR 53767. On April 26, 1991, the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded
the matter to the Administrator for clarification of DEA&#146;s
interpretation of the term &#147;currently accepted medical use
in treatment in the United States.&#148; Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936.</p>

<p>Following a review of the entire record in this matter, and a
comprehensive re-examination of the relevant statutory standard,
I conclude that marijuana has no currently accepted medical use
and must remain in Schedule I. Further hearings are unneces sary
since the record is extraordinarily complete, all parties had
ample opportunity and wide latitude to present evidence and to
brief all relevant issues, and the narrow question on remand
centers exclusively on this Agency&#146;s legal interpretation o
f a statutorily-created standard.</p>

<p>Summary of the Decision</p>

<p>Does the marijuana plant have any currently accepted medical
use in treatment in the United States, within the meaning of the
Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801, et seg.? Put
simply, is marijuana good medicine for illnesses we all fear,
such as multiple sclerosis (MS), glaucoma and cancer?</p>

<p>The answer might seem obvious based simply on common sense.
Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases. Americans
take their medicines in pills, solutions, sprays, shots, drops,
creams and sometimes in suppositories, but never by smoking. No
medicine prescribed for us today is smoked.</p>

<p>With a little homework, one can learn that marijuana has been
rejected as medicine by the American Medical Association, the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American Glaucoma
Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American
Canc er Society. Not one American health association accepts
marijuana as medicine.</p>

<p>For the last century, drug evaluation experts at the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been responsible
for protecting Americans from unsafe and ineffective new
medicines. Relying on the same scientific standards used to judge
all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected marijuana
for medical use.</p>

<p>Yet claims persist that marijuana has medical value. Are these
claims true? What are the facts?</p>

<p>Between 1987 and 1988, DEA and NORML, under the guidance of an
administrative law judge, collected all relevant information on
this subject. Stacked together it stands nearly five feet high.
Is there reliable scientific evidence that marijuana is me
dically effective? If it has medical value, do its benefits
outweigh its risks? What do America&#146;s top medical and
scientific experts say? Would they prescribe it for their
patients, their families, their friends?</p>

<p>As the current Administrator of Drug Enforcement, and as a
former United States District Judge, I have made a detailed
review of the evidence in this record to find the answers.</p>

<p>There are significant short-term side effects and long-term
risks linked to smoking marijuana. Marijuana is likely to be more
cancer-causing than tobacco; damages brain cells; causes lung
problems, such as bronchitis and emphysema; may weaken the bod
y&#146;s antibacterial defenses in the lungs; lowers overall
blood pressure, which could adversely affect the supply of blood
to the head; causes sudden drops in blood pressure (orthostatic
hypotension), rapid heart beat (tachycardia), and heart palpitati
ons; suppresses luteinizing hormone secretion in women, which
affects the production of progesterone, an important female
hormone; causes anxiety and panic in some users because of its
mind-altering effects; produces dizziness, trouble with thinking,
trou ble with concentrating, fatigue, and sleepiness; and impairs
motor skills.</p>

<p>As a plant, marijuana can contain bacteria capable of causing
serious infections in humans, such as salmonella enteritidis,
Klebsiella pneumonia, group D streptococcus and pathogenic
aspergillus.</p>

<p>Several of these risks stand out. The immune systems of cancer
patients are weakened by radiation and chemotherapy, leaving them
susceptible to infection. If they experiment with marijuana to
control nausea, they risk weakening their immune systems further
and exposing themselves to the infection-causing bacteria in the
plant. It is estimated, for example, that at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 60 patients die each year from
pathogenic aspergillus infections.</p>

<p>Glaucoma patients face possible blindness caused by very high
fluid pressures within their eyes. If they experiment with
marijuana to lower their eye fluid pressure, it can cause
dramatic drops in their blood pressure and reduce the blood
supply to t heir heads. Glaucoma experts testified this reduces
the blood supply to the optic nerves and could speed up, rather
than slow down, their loss of eyesight.</p>

<p>MS, glaucoma and cancer patients who have undiagnosed heart
problems risk heartpalpitations, very rapid heart beats and
sudden dramatic drops in blood pressure if they experiment with
marijuana. For MS and glaucoma patients who must take medications
for the rest of their lives, experimenting with marijuana poses
the additional risks of lung cancer, emphysema, bladder cancer
and leukemia.</p>

<p>Many risks remain unknown. Marijuana contains over 400
separately identified chemicals. No one knows all the effects of
burning these chemicals together and inhaling the burnt mix. Are
these risks outweighed by medical benefits?</p>

<p>There are scientific studies showing pure THC
(Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found
in marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.
Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in a clean capsule form, called
Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community. More
information on Marinol can be found in the &#147;Physicians&#146;
Desk Reference,&#148; available in most libraries.</p>

<p>Since marijuana contains THC, you might think marijuana also
would be effective. However, the effect of taking a drug in
combination with other chemicals is seldom the same as taking
just the pure drug. As already noted, marijuana contains over 400
o ther chemicals, not just THC. There are no reliable scientific
studies that show marijuana to be significantly effective in
controlling nausea and vomiting. People refer to the Sallan study
as proving marijuana&#146;s effectiveness. They are mistaken. The
Sallan study involved pure THC, not marijuana. People refer to
the Chang study to support marijuana&#146;s effectiveness. They
also are mistaken. Doctor Chang tested the combination of pure
THC and marijuana to treat nausea and vomiting. The prel iminary
results he got were probably due to the THC, not the marijuana.
Because he tested the combination, we cannot tell just what
effects can be attributed to marijuana alone. People cite a third
study, done by Doctor Levitt, as proof marijuana is eff ective.
They are mistaken. Doctor Levitt compared marijuana to THC in
controlling nausea and vomiting, and he concluded that THC was
the more effective drug.</p>

<p>A librarian can help locate copies of these studies should you
want to see them for yourself. Sallan, et al., &#147;Antiemetic
Effect of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannibinol in Patients Receiving
Cancer Chemotherapy,&#148; 293 New England Journal of Medicine
795-797 (1975); Chang, et al., &#147;Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
as an Antiemetic in Cancer Patients Receiving High-Dose
Methotrexate,&#148; 91 Annals of Internal Medicine 819-824
(1979); Levitt, et al., &#147;Randomized Double Blind Comparison
of Delta -9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Marijuana as
Chemotherapy Antiemetics,&#148; (Meeting Abstract) 3 Proceedings
of the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology 91 (1984).</p>

<p>During the 1970's and 1980's, a number of states set up
research programs to give marijuana to cancer and glaucoma
patients, on the chance it might help. Some people point to these
programs as proof of marijuana&#146;s usefulness. Unfortunately,
all research is not necessarily good scientific research. These
state programs failed to follow responsible scientific methods.
Patients took marijuana together with their regular medicines, so
it is impossible to say whether marijuana helped them. Observa
tions or results were not scientifically measured. Procedures
were so poor that much critical research data were lost or never
recorded. Although these programs were well-intentioned, they are
not scientific proof of anything.</p>

<p>Some people refer to a study by Doctor Thomas Ungerleider as
proof marijuana reduced nausea in bone marrow transplant
patients. Unfortunately, Doctor Ungerleider neglected to follow
responsible scientific methods in his study. Like the state
program s, it proves nothing. Doctor Ungerleider chose not to
publish his study evidently because of its serious weaknesses. He
admitted as much when questioned under oath.</p>

<p>Those who say there are reliable scientific studies showing
marijuana is an effective drug for treating nausea and vomiting
are wrong. No such studies exist.</p>

<p>Our nation&#146;s top cancer experts reject marijuana for
medical use. Doctor David S. Ettinger, a professor of oncology at
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, an author of
over 100 scholarly articles on cancer treatment, and a nationall
y respected cancer expert, testified:</p>

<p>There is no indication that marijuana is effective in treating
nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatment or other
causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted which make such
conclusions.</p>

<p>Doctor Richard J. Gralla, a professor of medicine at Cornell
University Medical College, an associate attending physician at
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and an expert in
cancer research, testified:</p>

<p>Most experts would say, and our studies support, that the
cannabinoids in general are not very effective against the major
causes of nausea and vomiting.</p>

<p>Doctor Gralla added:</p>

<p>I have found that because of the negative side effects and
problems associated with marijuana..., most medical oncologists
and researchers have little interest in marijuana for the
treatment of nausea and vomiting in their patients.</p>

<p>Doctor John Laszlo, Vice President of Research for the
American Cancer Society, an expert who has spent 37 years
researching cancer treatments, and who has written a leading
textbook on the subject, &#147;Antiemetics and Cancer
Chemotherapy,&#148; tes tified there is not enough scientific
evidence to justify using marijuana to treat nausea and vomiting.
Not one nationally-recognized cancer expert could be found to
testify on marijuana&#146;s behalf.</p>

<p>To be an effective treatment for glaucoma, a drug must: (I)
lower the pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure), (ii)
for prolonged periods of time, and (iii) actually preserve sight
(vidual fields). Five scientific studies are cited as evidence
marijuana is an effective glaucoma treatment. Those who cite
these studies are mistaken. These studies tested pure THC, not
marijuana. W.D. Purnell and J.M. Gregg,
&#147;Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, Euphoria and Intraocular
Pressure in Man,&#148; 7 A nnals of Ophthalmology 921-923 (1975);
M. Perez-Reyes, D. Wagner, M.E. Wall, and K.H. Davis,
&#147;Intravenous Administration of Cannabinoids on Intraocular
Pressure,&#148; The Pharmacology of Marijuana 829-832 (M.C.
Braude and S. Szara eds. 1976); J.C. M erritt, S.M. McKinnon,
J.R. Armstrong, G. Hatem, and L.A. Reid, &#147;Oral
Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Hyperogeneous Glaucomas,&#148; 12
Annals of Ophthalmology 947 (1980); K. Green and M. Roth,
&#147;Ocular Effects of Topical Administration of Delta-
9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Man,&#148; 100 Archives of
Ophthalmology 265-267 (1982); and W.M. Jay and K. Green,
&#147;Multiple-Drop Study of Topically Applied 1%
Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol in Human Eyes,&#148; 101 Archives of
Ophthalmology 591-593 (1983). </p>

<p>Three studies show very heavy doses of marijuana, taken for
short periods of time, can reduce eye pressure. R.S. Hepler, I.M.
Frank, and T.J. Ungerleider, &#147;Pupillary Constriction After
Marijuana Smoking,&#148; 74 American Journal of Ophthalmolog y
1185-1190 (1972); R.S. Hepler, I.M. Frank, and R. Petrus,
&#147;Ocular Effects of Marijuana Smoking,&#148; The Pharmacology
of Marijuana 815-824 (1976); and J.C. Merritt, W.J. Crawford,
P.C. Alexander, A.L. Anduze and S.S. Gelbart, &#147;Effect of
Marij uana on Intraocular and Blood Pressure in Glaucoma,&#148;
87 Ophthalmology 222-228 (1980).</p>

<p>Unusually large doses of marijuana were needed in these three
studies to achieve the desired effect. Heavy marijuana use
produces dizziness, trouble with thinking, impaired motor skills,
fatigue and sleepiness. The 1976 study by Doctors Hepler, Fran k
and Petrus emphasized &#147;Our subjects were sometimes too
sleepy to permit measurement of intraocular pressures...3 hours
after intoxication.&#148; If a glaucoma patient were to smoke
marijuana 8 to 10 times every day for the rest of his life, would
h e be alert and energetic enough to live a relatively normal
life? Would he develop other diseases? No scientific studies
exist to answer these questions. Robert Randall claims to have
saved his sight by smoking 8 to 10 marijuana cigarettes every
day. U nder oath he admits he stays at home most days, follows no
daily schedule or routine, and has not held a regular job in over
15 years. He also has avoided having a comprehensive medical
examination since 1975.</p>

<p>No scientific studies have shown marijuana can reduce eye
pressure over long periods of time.</p>

<p>No scientific studies have shown marijuana can save eyesight.</p>

<p>America&#146;s top glaucoma experts reject marijuana as
medicine. Doctor Keith Green is a professor of Ophthalmology who
serves, or has served, on the editorial boards of eight
prestigious eye journals (Ophthalmic Research, Oftalmo Abstracto,
Current Eye Research, Experimental Eye Research, Investigative
Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, Archives of
Ophthalmology, and Survey of Ophthalmology). Doctor Green has
conducted extensive basic and clinical research using marijuana
and THC to treat glaucoma patients. He has authored over 200
books or research articles in ophthalmology and is a highly
respected expert on this subject. Doctor Green testified:</p>

<p>There is no scientific evidence...that indicates that
marijuana is effective in regulating the progression of symptoms
associated with glaucoma. *** It is clear that there is no
evidence that marijuana use prevents the progression of visual
loss in gla ucoma. *** The quantities of the drug required to
reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma sufferers are large, and
would require the inhalation of at least six marijuana cigarettes
each day. *** Smoking is not a desirable form of treatment for
many reason s...[M]arijuana...has little potential future as a
glaucoma medication.</p>

<p>Doctor George Spaeth is the Director of the Glaucoma Service
at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, the largest service in the
United States devoted to researching and treating glaucoma and to
teaching other doctors about this disease. Doctor Spaeth is
President of the American Glaucoma Society. He is a professor of
ophthalmology, the editor of a scholarly eye journal (Ophthalmic
Surgery), and the author of over 200 research articles on
glaucoma. He testified:</p>

<p>I have not found any documentary evidence which indicates that
a single patient has had his or her natural history of the
disease altered by smoking marijuana.</p>

<p>Amputees and victims of MS can suffer from extreme muscle
spasms. It is claimed marijuana is useful in treating spasticity.
Three unusually small, inconclusive studies have tried using pure
THC, not marijuana, to treat spasticity. D.J. Petro and C.
Ellenberger, &#147;Treatment of Human Spasticity with
Delta-9-Tetrahydro-cannabinol,&#148; 21 Journal of Clinical
Pharmacology 413S-416S (1981) (included only nine patients). Two
of the studies are mere abstracts, or short digests, without much
detail. Hanigan, Destee &amp; Troung Abstr. B45, Clin. Pharmacol.
Ther. 198 (1986) (included only five patients), and Sandyk,
Cannoe, Stern and Snider Abstr. PP 331, 36 Neurology 342 (1986)
(included only three patients).</p>

<p>No scientific studies exist which test marijuana to relieve
spasticity. </p>

<p>National experts on MS reject marijuana as medicine. Doctor
Kenneth P. Johnson is chairman of the Department of Neurology at
the University of Maryland School of Medicine. He manages the
Maryland Center for MS, one of the most active MS research and
treatment centers in the United States. He sits on the editorial
boards of noted medical journals related to MS (Neurology and
Journal of Neuroimmunology). He is the author of over 100
scientific and medical articles on MS. Doctor Johnson has spent
mo st of his long career researching MS and has diagnosed and
treated more than 6,000 patients with MS. Doctor Johnson
testified:</p>

<p>At this time, I am not aware of...any legitimate medical
research in which marijuana was used to treat the symptoms of
multiple sclerosis. *** To conclude that marijuana is
therapeutically effective without conducting rigorous testing
would be professi onally irresponsible.</p>

<p>Doctor Stephen Reingold is Assistant Vice President of
Research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which
spends over $7 million each year on MS research. Only the Federal
Government spends more. Doctor Reingold testified:</p>

<p>I could find no actual published research which has used
marijuana.... In the existing research using THC, the results
were inconclusive.... In the absence of any well-designed,
well-controlled research..., the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society...d oes not endorse or advocate its use....</p>

<p>Doctor Donald H. Silberberg is Chairman of the Department of
Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital of
Pennsylvania. Doctor Silberberg is on the editorial board of
Annals of N eurology and is President of the National Medical
Advisory Board for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. He
has been actively researching and treating MS for most of his
career, has written over 130 medical articles on MS and is
Co-Director of a lar ge MS research center at the University of
Pennsylvania. Doctor Silberberg testified:</p>

<p>I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific works
which show that marijuana...is medically effective in treating
multiple sclerosis or spasticity. *** The long-term treatment of
the symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuana
could be devastating. *** [T]he use of (marijuana), especially
for long-term treatment...would be worse than the original
disease itself.</p>

<p>The only favorable evidence that could be found by NORML and
DEA consists of stories by marijuana users who claim to have been
helped by the drug. Scientists call these stories anecdotes. They
do not accept them as reliable proofs. The FDA&#146;s r
egulations, for example, provide that in deciding whether a new
drug is a safe and effective medicine, &#147;isolated case
reports...will not be considered.&#148; 21 CFR 314.126(e). Why do
scientists consider stories from patients and their doctors to b
e unreliable?</p>

<p>First, sick people are not objective scientific observers,
especially when it comes to their own health. We all have heard
of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency to respond to
drugs as they believe is expected of them. Imagine how magnifie d
this placebo effect can be when a suffering person experiments on
himself, praying for some relief. Many stories no doubt are due
to the placebo effect, not to any real medical effects of
marijuana.</p>

<p>Second, most of the stories come from people who took
marijuana at the same time they took prescription drugs for their
symptoms. For example, Robert Randall claims marijuana has saved
his sight, yet he has taken standard glaucoma drugs continuously
since 1972. There is noobjective way to tell from these stories
whether it is marijuana that is helpful, or the proven,
traditional medicines. Even these users can never know for sure.</p>

<p>Third, any mind-altering drug that produces euphoria can make
a sick person think he feels better. Stories from patients who
claim marijuana helps them may be the result of the mind-altering
effects of the drug, not the results of improvements in the ir
conditions.</p>

<p>Fourth, long-time abusers of marijuana are not immune to
illness. Many eventually get cancer, glaucoma, MS and other
diseases. People who become dependent on mind-altering drugs tend
to rationalize their behavior. They invent excuses, which they ca
n come to believe, to justify their drug dependence. Stories of
marijuana&#146;s benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.
Robert Randall, for example, admits under oath to becoming a
regular marijuana user in 1968, four years before he showed the
first signs of, and was diagnosed as having, glaucoma. Since then
he has smoked marijuana 8 to 10 times every day.</p>

<p>A century ago many Americans relied on stories to pick their
medicines, especially from snake oil salesmen. Thanks to
scientific advances and to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) in 1906, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seg., we now
rely on rigorous scientific proof to assure the safety and
effectiveness of new drugs. Mere stories are not considered an
acceptable way to judge whether dangerous drugs should be used as
medicines.</p>

<p>There are doctors willing to testify that marijuana has
medical uses. NORML found over a dozen to testify in this case.
We have a natural tendency to believe doctors. We assume their
opinions are entitled to respect. But what if a doctor is giving
an opinion beyond his professional competence? Evaluating the
safety and effectiveness of drugs is a specialized area. Does the
doctor have this specialized expertise? Is he familiar with all
the published scientific studies? Or is he improperly basi ng his
opinion on mere stories or anecdotal evidence? Does he really
know what he is talking about? Does he have a personal motive to
exaggerate or lie? Questions like these led the United States
Supreme Court, in 1973, to warn about the opinions of do ctors
concerning the value of drugs as medicine, when not supported by
rigorous scientific testing,</p>

<p>Weinberger v. Hynson, etc., 412 U.S. 609, 639:</p>

<p>[I]mpressions or beliefs of physicians, no matter how
fervently held, are treacherous.</p>

<p>Nearly half the doctors who testified for NORML are
psychiatrists. They do not specialize in treating or researching
cancer, glaucoma or MS. One is a general practitioner who works
as a wellness counselor at a health spa. Under oath he admits to
us ing every illegal, mind-altering drug he has ever studied, and
he prides himself on recommending drugs that would never be
recommended by medical schools or reputable physicians. Another
is a general practitioner who quit practicing in 1974. He admits
h e has not kept up on new medical and scientific information
about marijuana for 18 years.</p>

<p>Only one of the doctors called by NORML is a
nationally-recognized expert. Doctor John C. Merritt is a
board-certified ophthalmologist and researcher who has authored
articles on the use of marijuana and cannabinoids to reduce eye
pressure. He is in private practice and sees mostly children who
suffer from glaucoma. Doctor Merritt testified, &#147;[M]arijuana
is a highly effective IOP-lowering drug which may be of critical
value to some glaucoma patients who, without marijuana, would
progressively go blind.&#148; The last scientific study using
marijuana in glaucoma patients, published by Doctor Merritt in
1979, concluded:</p>

<p>It is because of the frequency and severity with which the
untoward events occurred thatmarijuana inhalation is not an ideal
therapeutic modality for glaucoma patients.</p>

<p>One year later, in 1980, Doctor Merritt gave the following
testimony, under oath, before the United States Congress, House
Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control:</p>

<p>For me to sit here and say that the lowering pressure effects
occurred repeatedly, day in and day out, I have no data, and
neither does anyone else, and that is the real crux of the
matter. When we are talking about treating a disease like
glaucoma, w hich is a chronic disease, the real issue is, does
the marijuana repeatedly lower the intraocular pressure? I have
shown you no...studies and to my knowledge there is no data to
that effect.</p>

<p>Doctor Merritt was unable to explain, under oath, the
contradictory positions he has taken on this subject.</p>

<p>Each of NORML&#146;s doctors testified his opinion is based on
the published scientific studies. With one exception, none of
them could identify under oath the scientific studies they swore
they relied on. Only one had enough knowledge to discuss th e
scientific technicalities involved. Eventually, each one admitted
he was basing his opinion on anecdotal evidence, on stories he
heard from patients, and on his impressions about the drug.</p>

<p>Sadly, Doctor Ivan Silverberg, an oncologist from San
Francisco, exaggerated while on the witness stand. At first he
swore &#147;there is voluminous medical research which shows
marijuana is effective in easing nausea and vomiting.&#148;
Pushed on c ross-examination to identify this voluminous
research, Doctor Silverberg replied, &#147;Well..., I&#146;m
going to have to back off a little bit from that.&#148; How far
would Doctor Silberberg back off? Was he aware, at least, of the
approximate number of scientific studies that have been done
using marijuana to treat nausea? Under oath, he replied, &#147;I
would doubt very few. But, no, I&#146;m not.&#148;</p>

<p>Beyond doubt, the claims that marijuana is medicine are false,
dangerous and cruel.</p>

<p>Sick men, women and children can be fooled by these claims and
experiment with the drug. Instead of being helped, they risk
serious side effects. If they neglect their regular medicines
while trying marijuana, the damage could be irreversible. It i s
a cruel hoax to offer false hope to desperately ill people.</p>

<p>Those who insist marijuana has medical uses would serve
society better by promoting or sponsoring more legitimate
scientific research, rather than throwing their time, money and
rhetoric into lobbying, public relations campaigns and perennial
litigati on.</p>

<p>Clarification of Currently Accepted Medical Use</p>

<p>The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 divides the universe of
all drugs of abuse into five sets or schedules. Drugs in Schedule
I are subject to the most severe controls, because they have a
high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. 21 U.S.C. 812 (b) (1). Drugs of
abuse which have currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States are placed in Schedules II, III, IV and V.
Regrettably the Controlled Substances Act does not speak directly
to what is meant by &#147;currently accepted medical use.&#148;</p>

<p>A century before the Controlled Substances Act was enacted,
the determination of what drugs to accept as medicine was totally
democratic and totally standardless. Each patient and each
physician was free to decide for himself, often based on no more
than anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>This state of affairs became unsatisfactory to a majority of
the American people. In 1906, Congress intervened with the
passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). A shift began
away from anecdotal evidence to objectively conducted scientific
research, away fromuninformed opinions of lay persons and local
doctors to expert opinions of specialists trained to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of drugs, and away from totally
democratic decision-making to oversight by the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>By 1969, Congress had developed detailed Federal statutory
criteria under the FDCA to determine whether drugs are acceptable
for medical use. Those deemed acceptable can be marketed
nationally. Those deemed unacceptable are subject to Federal
seizur e if marketed interstate. The FDCA is a very complex
regulatory scheme not easily summarized. However, it is fair to
say that drugs falling into one of four FDCA categories were
accepted by Congress for medical use.</p>

<p>First, Congress accepted new drugs which have been approved by
FDA&#146;s experts as safe and effective for use in treatment,
based on substantial scientific evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and
355 (so-called &#147;NDA-approved drugs&#148;).</p>

<p>Second, Congress accepted those drugs &#147;generally
recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, as
safe and effective,&#148; based on substantial scientific
evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and 355; Weinberger v. Bentex
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 412 U.S.645 (1973). An acronym for this
category is &#147;human GRASE drugs&#148; (Generally Recognized
As Safe and Effective). These drugs achieve acceptance through
rigorous scienti fic proof, through a past history of widespread
use in treatment in the United States, and through recognition by
a consensus of drug experts outside the FDA.</p>

<p>Third, Congress accepted for use in veterinary medicine those
drugs &#147;generally recognized, among experts qualified by
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective,&#148; based
on substantial scientific evidence. 21 U.S.C. 321(w) and 355. An
acronym for these is &#147;animal GRASE drugs.&#148; They achieve
acceptance through rigorous scientific evidence and through
recognition by a consensus of drug experts outside the FDA. U
nlike human GRASE drugs, animal GRASE drugs need not have a past
history of widespread use.</p>

<p>Finally, Congress accepted those drugs marketed prior to 1938
which had been subject to the 1906 provisions of the FDCA,
provided these very old drugs retain their exact formulations and
are never promoted for new uses. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and (w). The se
are politically &#147;grandfathered&#148; drugs. They need not
meet modern standards for safety and effectiveness.</p>

<p>A fifth group of drugs was accepted for research use only, not
for use in treatment of patients. 21U.S.C. 355(I) (so-called
&#147;IND or approved investigational new drugs&#148;).</p>

<p>Drugs intended for medical use and shipped interstate are
subject to Federal seizure under the FDCA if they do not fit
within one of the above accepted sets or groupings. It seems fair
to say that seizable drugs were rejected by Congress for medical
use.</p>

<p>In enacting the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, could
Congress have intended to create a totally new Federal standard
for determining whether drugs have accepted medical uses? Or did
Congress intend to rely on standards it had developed over the pr
ior 64 years under the FDCA? There is nothing in the Controlled
Substances Act, its legislative history, or its purposes that
would indicate Congress intended to depart radically from
existing Federal law.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seems likely that the core standards developed
under the FDCA represent a long-term consensus of expert medical
and scientific opinion concerning when a drug should be accepted
by anyone as safe and effective for medical use.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a way to corroborate what Congress
intended. Congress did more than just announce criteria for
scheduling drugs of abuse under the Controlled Substances
Act;Congress applied those criteria to an initial listing of
drugs that it placed into the original five schedules of the Act.</p>

<p>NDA-approved drugs were placed by Congress into Schedules II,
III, IV and V of the Act. For example, pethidine (also known as
meperidine) received New Drug Application (NDA) approval in 1942.
Congress put it into Schedule II(b) (14). Methamphetamin e had an
approved NDA. Congress put it into Schedule III(a) (3). I am not
aware of any drug with an approved NDA that Congress originally
put into Schedule I.</p>

<p>Drugs with medical uses, but without approved NDA&#146;s also
were placed by Congress into Schedules II, III, IV and V. For
example, cocaine was put into Schedule II(a) (4). Codeine
combinations were put into Schedules III(d) (I) and V. Morphine
co mbinations were put into Schedule III(d) (8). Phenobarbital
was put into Schedule IV(11). Barbiturates were put into Schedule
III(b) (1). Amphetamines were put into Schedule III(a) (1).</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was correct when it
decided in Grinspoon v. DEA, 828 F.2d 881 (1987) that NDA
approval is not the only method by which drugs can achieve
Federal recognition as having medical uses. Congress put both
GRASE an d pre-1938-grandfathered drugs into Schedules II, III,
IV and V of the CSA.</p>

<p>Drugs recognized under the FDCA for research use only, not for
use in treatment, such as alphacetylmethadol and marijuana, were
placed by Congress into Schedule I.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Federal records are not complete enough to do a
comprehensive mathematical mapping, tracing every drug in the
initial Controlled Substances Act schedules back to its legal
status under the FDCA. Nevertheless, determining legislative in
tent does not require mathematical certainty. Probability based
on circumstantial evidence, on samplings, and in inductive
reasoning can suffice, especially when there is nowhere else to
turn.</p>

<p>The pattern of initial scheduling of drugs in the Controlled
Substances Act, viewed in light of the prior legal status of
these drugs under the FDCA, convinces me that Congress equated
the term &#147;currently accepted medical use in treatment in the
United States&#148; as used in the Controlled Substances Act with
the core FDCA standards for acceptance of drugs for medical sue.</p>

<p>This is not to say that every FDCA requirement for GRASE
status, or for NDA approval, is pertinent to scheduling
determinations under the Controlled Substances Act. There are
differences. But the core FDCA criteria appear to have guided the
Congress in the decisions it made concerning the initial
scheduling of drugs in the Act.</p>

<p>These same core FDCA criteria served as the basis for an
eight-point test used by my predecessor as Administrator to
describe drugs with currently accepted medical uses.</p>

<p>54 FR 53783 (December 29, 1989):</p>

<p>1.Scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry;</p>

<p>2.The toxicology and pharmacology of the substance in animals;</p>

<p>3.Establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials;</p>

<p>4.General availability of the substance and information
regarding the substance and its use;</p>

<p>5.Recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>6.Specific indications for the treatment of recognized
disorders;</p>

<p>7.Recognition of the use of the substance by organizations or
associations of physicians; and </p>

<p>8.Recognition and use of the substance by a substantial
segment of the medical practitioners in the United States.</p>

<p>Some uncertainty remains over the precise meaning and
application of parts of this test. Therefore, the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded these
proceedings for a further explanation. In addition to addressing
those parts o f the test that concerned the Court of Appeals, it
would be useful to clarify the entire test, pinpoint its origins,
and identify which elements are both necessary and sufficient to
establish a prima facie case of currently accepted medical use.
This is not an effort to change the substantive law. The
statutory meaning of currently accepted medical use remains the
same as enacted by Congress in 1970. My purpose simply is to
clarify this Agency&#146;s understanding of the law.</p>

<p>A. The Drug&#146;s Chemistry Must Be Known and Reproducible.</p>

<p>The ability to recreate a drug in standardized dosages is
fundamental to testing that drug and to using it as a medicine.
Knowing the composition, properties, methods of production, and
methods of analysis of a drug is essential to reproducing it in
standardized dosages. To be GRASE or to receive NDA approval, a
drug&#146;s chemistry must be known and reproducible. See e.g.,
21 CFR 314.50(d) (1) and 314.126(b) (7) (d); Dorovic v.
Richardson, 749F.2d 242, 251 (7th Cir. 1973). The listing of a
drug in a current edition of one of the official compendia
normally satisfies this requirement. 21 U.S.C. 321(j); 21 CFR
314.50(d) (1).</p>

<p>The first element of our eight-point test, namely,
&#147;scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry,&#148; should be clarified to read:</p>

<p>The substance&#146;s chemistry must be scientifically
established to permit it to be reproduced into dosages which can
be standardized. The listing of the substance in a current
edition of one of the official compendia, as defined by Section
201(j) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(j), is
sufficient generally to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>Acceptance of this knowledge will be discussed elsewhere.</p>

<p>B. There Must Be Adequate Safety Studies</p>

<p>No drug can be considered safe in the abstract. Safety has
meaning only when judged against the intended use of the drug,
its known effectiveness, its known and potential risks, the
severity of the illness to be treated, and the availability of
alter native therapies. Hess &amp; Clark Division of Rhodia, Inc.
v. FDA, 495 F.2d 975, 993 (D.C. Cir. 1974). To know the risks,
there must be adequate studies, by all methods reasonably
applicable, to show the pharmacological and toxicological effects
of the drug. 21 CFR 314.125(b) (2). This includes animal studies
and clinical trials in large numbers of humans. 21 CFR 312.21.
The studies need not be well-controlled, but they must be
adequate. Edison Pharmaceuticals Co. v. FDA, 600 F.2d 831 (D.C.
Cir. 1 979). Short term (acute) studies of a drug intended to
treat long term (chronic) illness, such as glaucoma or MS, are
clearly inadequate. United States v. Naremco, Inc., 553 F.2d
1138, 1143 (8th Cir. 1977). The second element of our eight-point
test, n amely, &#147;the toxicology and pharmacology of the
substance in animals,&#148; should be clarified as follows:</p>

<p>There must be adequate pharmacological and toxicological
studies, done by all methods reasonably applicable, on the basis
of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded, by experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of drugs, that the substance is safe for
treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that while the existence of adequate
safety tests is a separate analytical question, the ultimate
determination of whether a drug is safe for a specific use is not
adistinct issue. Safety and effectiveness are inextricably linked
in a risks-benefits calculation. A determination that a drug is
ineffective is tantamount to a determination that it is unsafe.
United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544 (1970).</p>

<p>The scheduling criteria of the Controlled Substances Act
appear to treat the lack of medical use and lack of safety as
separate considerations. Prior rulings of this Agency purported
to treat safety as a distinct factor. 53 FR 5156 (February 22,
198 8). In retrospect, this is inconsistent with scientific
reality. Safety cannot be treated as a separate analytical
question.</p>

<p>C. There Must Be Adequate and Well-Controlled Studies Proving
Efficacy.</p>

<p>Since 1962, Congress has prohibited the FDA to approve an NDA
unless the applicant submits adequate, well-controlled,
well-designed, well-conducted, and well-documented studies,
performed by qualified investigators, which prove the efficacy of
a drug for its intended use. 21 U.S.C. 355(d); 21 CFR 314.126.
Similarly, a drug cannot be considered GRASE unless it is
supported by this same quantity and quality of scientific proof.
21 CFR 314.200(e) (I); Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc. , 412 U.S. 609,
629 (19 73).</p>

<p>Studies involving related, but not identical, drugs are
irrelevant. United States v. Articles of Food &amp; Drug, 518
F.2d 743, 747 (5th Cir. 1975). Studies involving the same </p>

<p>drug combined with other drugs are irrelevant. United States
v. Articles of Drug...Promise Toothpaste, 826 F.2d 564, 570 (7th
Cir. 1987). Incomplete studies are insufficient. United States v.
Articles of Food &amp; Drug, supra. Uncontrolled studies a re
insufficient. 21 U.S.C. 355(d); Cooper Labs v. FDA, 501 F.2d 772,
778 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Statistically insignificant studies are
insufficient. 21 CFR 312.21, 314.50(d) (6) and 314.126(b) (7).
Poorly designed studies are insufficient. 21 CFR 314.126( b) (2).
Poorly conducted studies are insufficient. 21 CFR Part 58 - -
Good Laboratory Practices. Poorly documented studies are
insufficient. 21 CFR 312.58 and 314.200(e) (4). Studies by
investigators who are not qualified, both to conduct and to eval
uate them, are insufficient. 21 U.S.C. 355(d). Moreover, since
scientific reliability requires a double examination with similar
results, one valid study is insufficient. There must be two or
more valid studies which corroborate each other. See l J. O
&#146;Reilley &#147;Food and Drug Administration&#148; 13-55 n.12
(1985).</p>

<p>Lay testimonials, impressions of physicians, isolated case
studies, random clinical experience, reports so lacking in
details they cannot be scientifically evaluated, and all other
forms of anecdotal proof are entirely irrelevant. 21 CFR
314.126(e); Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 630 (1973).</p>

<p>Element three of our eight-point test, namely,
&#147;establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials,&#148; should be restated
as:</p>

<p>There must be adequate, well-controlled, well-designed,
well-conducted and well-documented studies, including clinical
investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, on
the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded
by such experts that the substance will have the intended effect
in treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>D. Acceptance by Qualified Experts Is Required.</p>

<p>The opinions of lay persons are totally irrelevant to whether
a drug is GRASE or meets NDA requirements. The observations and
opinions of medical practitioners who are not experts in
evaluating drugs also are irrelevant to whether a drug is GRASE
or meets NDA requirements.</p>

<p>Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 619 (1973). By
explicit requirements in the FDCA since 1938, the only body of
opinion that counts is that of experts qualified by scientific
trainingand experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
of d rugs. 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and (w).</p>

<p>From this, one would conclude that expert acceptance of a drug
as safe and effective for its intended use is essential to a drug
having a currently accepted medical use under the CSA. How
widespread must this expert acceptance be?</p>

<p>To be GRASE, a drug must be &#147;generally recognized&#148;
among experts as safe and effective for its intended use. The
drug must be known or familiar to the national community of
relevant experts. United States v Articles of Drug...Furestrol
Vag inal Suppositories, 294 F. Supp. 1307, 1309 (N.D. Ga. 1968)
aff&#146;d, 415 F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1969). To determine if a drug
is known to the community of experts, courts have looked to
whether there is widely available scientific literature about the
dru g, Premo Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Inc. v. United States,
629 F.2d 795, 803 (2d Cir. 1980), whether it is widely taught in
medical schools, Lemmon Pharmaceuticals Co. v. Richardson, 319 F.
Supp. 375, 378 (E.D. Pa. 1970), and whether it is widely discus
sed by experts. United States v. Bentex Ulcerine, 469 F.2d 875,
880 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>

<p>The recognition of a drug as GRASE need not be universal.
General recognition is sufficient. United States v. 41
Cartons...Ferro-Lac, 420 F.2d 1126, 1132 (5th Cir. 1970). The
Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean a consensus of experts
is fami liar with and accepts a drug as safe and effective.
Weinberger v. Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 629 (1973). However, if
there is a serious dispute among the experts, a drug cannot be
considered GRASE. United States v. An Article of Food...Coco
Rico, 752 F.2d 11, 15 (lst Cir. 1985); Merrit Corp. v. Folsom,
165 F. Supp. 418, 421 (D.D.C. 1958).</p>

<p>During the NDA process, the FDA may reach out to the expert
community for its views. 21 CFR 314.103 (3). The FDA need not
determine that a drug is generally known and accepted by the
expert community. Nor must the FDA develop a consensus of op
inion among outside experts. The FDA has both the experts and the
statutory mandate to resolve conflicts over the safety and
efficacy of new drugs. Weinberger v. Bentex Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 412 U.S. 638, 653 (1973).</p>

<p>In drafting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress appears to
have accommodated, rather than chosen from these different FDCA
standards. Clearly, the Controlled Substances Act does not
authorize the Attorney General, nor by delegation the DEA Admini
strator, to make the ultimate medical and policy decision as to
whether a drug should be used as medicine. Instead, he is limited
to determining whether others accept a drug for medical use. Any
other construction would have the effect of reading the wo rd
&#147;accepted&#148; out of the statutory standard. Since
Congress recognized NDA-approved drugs as having currently
accepted medical uses, without any need for a national consensus
of experts, FDA acceptance of a drug through the NDA process
would see m to satisfy the Controlled Substances Act. And, since
Congress recognized GRASE drugs as having currently accepted
medical uses, without the need for NDA approval, acceptance of a
drug by a national consensus of experts also would seem to
satisfy the Ac t.</p>

<p>When a drug lacks NDA approval and is not accepted by a
consensus of experts outside FDA, it cannot be found by the
Attorney General or his delegate to have a currently accepted
medical use. To do so would require the Attorney General to
resolve comp lex scientific and medical disputes among experts,
to decide the ultimate medical policy question, rather than
merely determine whether the drug is accepted by others.</p>

<p>Because the recognition of a drug by non-experts is irrelevant
to GRASE status, to NDAapproval, and to currently accepted
medical use under the Controlled Substances Act, points seven and
eight of our eight-point test should be combined and restated a s
follows:</p>

<p>The drug has a New Drug Application (NDA) approved by the Food
and Drug Administration pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. Or, a consensus of the national community of
experts, qualified by scientific training and experience to
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, accepts the
safety and effectiveness of the substance for use in treating a
specific, recognized disorder. A material conflict of opinion
among experts precludes a finding of consensus.</p>

<p>This restatement also incorporates the component of part one
of our eight-point test concerning &#147;accepted knowledge of
its chemistry.&#148;</p>

<p>E. The Scientific Evidence Must Be Widely Available. </p>

<p>Nothing in the FDCA, nor in FDA&#146;s regulations, requires
that scientific evidence supporting an NDA be published. This
stems from the fact that a consensus of experts outside FA is not
required for NDA approval. In contrast, most courts have hel d
that a drug cannot be considered GRASE unless the supporting
scientific evidence appears in the published scientific and
medical literature. Without published studies, it would be
difficult for the community of experts outside FDA to develop an
informe d acceptance of a drug for medical use. Cooper Labs Inc.
v. FDA, 501 F.2d 772, 786 (D.C. Cir. 1974).</p>

<p>Point four of the eight-point test focuses, in part, on the
&#147;general availability of information regarding the substance
and its use.&#148; This should be clarified to read:</p>

<p>In the absence of NDA approval, information concerning the
chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and effectiveness of the
substance must be reported, published, or otherwise widely
available, in sufficient detail to permit experts, qualified by
scientifi c training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of drugs, to fairly and responsibly conclude the
substance is safe and effective for use in treating a specific,
recognized disorder.</p>

<p>F. General Availability of a Drug Is Irrelevant.</p>

<p>The second component of point four of the eight-point test
involves the &#147;general availability of the substance&#148;
for use in treatment. The second component of point eight focuses
on &#147;use of the substance by a substantial segment of the
medical practitioners in the United States.&#148; These elements
justifiably concerned the Court of Appeals, leading to the remand
in this case.</p>

<p>Under the FDCA, a human GRASE drug must have a material
history of past use in treatment in the United States. 21 U.S.C.
321 (p) (2) (which has..., otherwise than in such investigations,
been used to a material extent or a material time); Weinberger v.
Hynson, Etc., 412 U.S. 609, 631 (1973). Rigorous scientific
proofs and current unanimous acceptance by the medical and
scientific community are not enough for a human drug to be GRASE.
Tri-Bio Labs, Inc. v. United States, 836 F.2d 135, 142 n.8 (3d
Cir .. 1987). The general availability of a drug for use in
treatment is a factor courts have considered to determine if a
human drug is GRASE.</p>

<p>In contrast, a drug can achieve current acceptance for human
medical use through the NDA process without a past history of
medical use in treatment. Also, animal drugs can become accepted
as GRASE without any past history of medical use. Given this
conflict in FDCA standards, which did Congress choose when
drafting the CSA?</p>

<p>As the Court of Appeals points out, requiring a material
history of past use in treatment before recognizing a drug as
having a currently accepted medical use, would permanently
freezeall Schedule I drugs into Schedule I. 930 F.2d at 940.
Clearly, C ongress did not intend this result. Moreover, the use
of the word &#147;currently&#148; before the term &#147;accepted
medical use&#148; would indicate Congress rejected the human
GRASE requirement of past material use in treatment. I conclude
that the general availability of a drug is irrelevant to whether
it has a currently accepted medical use in treatment within the
meaning of the Controlled Substances Act.</p>

<p>G. Recognition in Generally Accepted Texts Is Irrelevant.</p>

<p>Point five of the eight-point test deals with
&#147;recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks.&#148;
The listing of a drug in an official compendium is sufficient to
show its chemist ry is scientifically established. This appears
in my clarification to point one. The requirement that
information concerning the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology
and effectiveness of the substance be reported, published or
otherwise widely available, is explained adequately in revised
point four. To the extent the scheduling of a drug directly
influences its recognition in publications, this element is
subject to the same criticism identified by the Court of Appeals
concerning point four. Therefore , this should not be treated as
a distinct requirement.</p>

<p>H. Specific, Recognized Disorders Are the Referent.</p>

<p>It is impossible to judge the safety and effectiveness of a
drug except in relation to a specific intended use. A drug cannot
obtain NDA approval or GRASE status except in relation to the
treatment of a specific, recognized disorder. This is an esse
ntial aspect of whether a drug has currently accepted medical
use. Rather than standing alone, this requirement will be more
clearly understood by incorporating it into the other critical
elements.</p>

<p>To summarize, the five necessary elements of a drug with
currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States
are:</p>

<p>(I) The Drug&#146;s Chemistry Must Be Known and Reproducible</p>

<p>The substance&#146;s chemistry must be scientifically
established to permit it to be reproduced into dosages which can
be standardized. The listing of the substance in a current
edition of one of the official compendia, as defined by Section
201(j) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(j), is
sufficient generally to meet this requirement.</p>

<p>(ii) There Must Be Adequate Safety Studies</p>

<p>There must be adequate pharmacological and toxicological
studies done by all methods reasonably applicable on the basis of
which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded, by experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the
sa fety and effectiveness of drugs, that the substance is safe
for treating a specific, recognized disorder.</p>

<p>(iii) There Must Be Adequate and Well-Controlled Studies
Proving Efficacy</p>

<p>There must be adequate, well-controlled, well-designed,
well-conducted and well-documented studies, including clinical
investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and
experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs on
the b asis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded
by such experts, that the substance will have its intended effect
in treating a specific, recognized disorder. </p>

<p>(iv) The Drug Must Be Accepted by Qualified Experts</p>

<p>The drug must have a New Drug Application (NDA) approved by
the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. 21 U.S.C. 355. Or, a consensus of the national
community of experts, qualified by scientific training and experi
ence to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs, must
accept the safety and effectiveness of the substance for use in
treating a specific, recognized disorder. A materialconflict of
opinion among experts precludes a finding of consensus.</p>

<p>(v) The Scientific Evidence Must Be Widely Available</p>

<p>In the absence of NDA approval, information concerning the
chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and effectiveness of the
substance must be reported, published, or otherwise widely
available in sufficient detail to permit experts, qualified by
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of drugs, to fairly and responsibly conclude the
substance is safe and effective for use in treating a specific,
recognized disorder.</p>

<p>Together these five elements constitute prima facie evidence
that a drug has currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. In the interest of total clarity, let me
emphasize those proofs that are irrelevant to the determination
of currently accepted medical use, and that will not be
considered by the Administrator: </p>

<p>(I) Isolated case reports;</p>

<p>(ii) Clinical impressions of practitioners;</p>

<p>(iii) Opinions of persons not qualified by scientific training
and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
substance at issue;</p>

<p>(iv) Studies or reports so lacking in detail as to preclude
responsible scientific evaluation;</p>

<p>(v) Studies or reports involving drug substances other than
the precise substance at issue;</p>

<p>(vi) Studies or reports involving the substance at issue
combined with other drug substances;</p>

<p>(vii) Studies conducted by persons not qualified by scientific
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
of the substance at issue;</p>

<p>(viii) Opinions of experts based entirely on unrevealed or
unspecified information</p>

<p>(ix) Opinions of experts based entirely on theoretical
evaluations of safety or effectiveness.</p>

<p>Bad Medicine By Any Standard</p>

<p>My predecessor as DEA Administrator developed and relied upon
an eight-point test to determine whether marijuana has accepted
medical uses. 54 FR 53783 (December 29, 1989):</p>

<p>1.Scientifically determined and accepted knowledge of its
chemistry;</p>

<p>2.The toxicology and pharmacology of the substance in animals;</p>

<p>3.Establishment of its effectiveness in humans through
scientifically designed clinical trials;</p>

<p>4.General availability of the substance and information
regarding the substance and its use;</p>

<p>5.Recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>6.Specific indications for the treatment of recognized
disorders;</p>

<p>7.Recognition of the use of the substance by organizations or
associations of physicians; and</p>

<p>8.Recognition and use of the substance by a substantial
segment of the medical practitioners</p>

<p>in the United States. </p>

<p>The Court of Appeals remanded the decision of my predecessor
for clarification of what role factors (4), (5) and (8) of the
initial eight-point test played in his reasoning. For ease of
discussion, these factors can be divided as follows:</p>

<p>(4) (a) General availability of the substance...;</p>

<p>(4) (b) General availability of...information regarding the
substance and its use;</p>

<p>(5) Recognition of its clinical use in generally accepted
pharmacopeia; medical references, journals or textbooks;</p>

<p>(8)(a) Recognition...of the substance by a substantial segment
of the medical practitioners in the United States; and</p>

<p>(8) (b) [U]se of the substance by a substantial segment of the
medical practitioners in theUnited States.</p>

<p>I have found no evidence indicating initial factors (4) (a) or
(8) (b) played any role in my predecessor&#146;s decision. In
light of my understanding of the legal standard involved, these
factors are irrelevant to whether marijuana has a currently a
ccepted medical use.</p>

<p>My predecessor emphasized the lack of scientific evidence of
marijuana&#146;s effectiveness, and the limited data available on
its risks, as reflected in the published scientific studies. He
also emphasized the importance of this data to the conclusi ons
reached by experts concerning the drug. 54 FR 53783. I take this
to mean that, under initial factor (4) (b), he believed the
information available to experts is insufficient for them
responsibly and fairly to conclude that marijuana is safe and
effec tive for use as medicine</p>

<p>Marijuana is not recognized as medicine in generally accepted
pharmacopeia, medical references and textbooks, as noted by my
predecessor. 54 FR 53784. I take this to mean, under initial
factor (5), that he determined that marijuana&#146;s chemistry is
neither known, no reproducible, as evidenced by its absence from
the official pharmacopeia. Finally, my predecessor concluded,
under initial factor (8) (a), that the vast majority of
physicians does not accept marijuana as having medical use. 54 FR
5 3784. Along the way, he found that highly respected oncologists
and antiemetic researchers reject marijuana for use in
controlling nausea and vomiting, 54 FR 5377, that experts
experienced in researching glaucoma medications reject marijuana
for use in t reating glaucoma, 54 FR 53779, and that noted
neurologists who specialize in treating and conducting research
in spasticity reject marijuana for use by MS patients, 54 FR
53780. I take this to mean my predecessor found no national
consensus of qualified experts accepts marijuana&#146;s value as
medicine.</p>

<p>Certainly I cannot know my predecessor&#146;s unstated
reasoning. However, I have reviewed the entire record de novo,
and I am convinced that his application of the initial
eight-point test to this record correctly resulted in the
conclusion that mar ijuana has no currently accepted medical use
in treatment in the United States. Therefore, I adopt in their
entirety the findings of facts and conclusions of law reached by
the former Administrator in his final order of December 21, 1989,
54 FR 53767.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the remand of the Court of Appeals, I have
condensed and clarified the initial standard into a five-point
test. My application of the refined, five-point test to this
record is set out briefly below.</p>

<p>First, marijuana&#146;s chemistry is neither fully known, nor
reproducible. Thus far, over 400 different chemicals have been
identified in the plant. The proportions and concentrations
differ from plant to plant, depending on growing conditions, age
of the plant, harvesting and storage factors. THC levels can vary
from less than 0.2% to over 10%. It is now known how smoking or
burning the plant material affects the composition of all these
chemicals. It is not possible to reproduce the drug in dos ages
which can be considered standardized by any currently accepted
scientific criteria. Marijuana is not recognized in any current
edition of the official compendia. 21 U.S.C. 321(j).</p>

<p>Second, adequate safety studies have not been done. All
reasonably applicable pharmacological and toxicological studies
have not been carried out. Most of the chronic animal studies
have been conducted with oral or intravenous THC, not with
marijuan a. Pharmacological data on marijuana&#146;s
bioavailability, metabolic pathways and pharmacokinetics is
inadequate. Studies in humans are too small and too few.
Sophisticated epidemiological studies of marijuana use in large
populations are required, si milar to those done for tobacco use.
Far too many questions remain unknown for experts fairly and
responsibly to conclude marijuana is safe for any use.</p>

<p>Third, there are no adequate, well-controlled scientific
studies proving marijuana is effectivefor anything.</p>

<p>Fourth, marijuana is not accepted for medical use in treatment
by even a respectable minority, much less a consensus, of experts
trained to evaluate drugs. The FDA&#146;s expert drug evaluators
have rejected marijuana for medical use. No NDA has bee n
approved by FDA for marijuana. The testimony of nationally
recognized experts overwhelmingly rejects marijuana as medicine,
compared to the scientifically empty testimony of the
psychiatrists, a wellness counselor and general practitioners
presented by NORML.</p>

<p>Fifth, given my conclusions on points one, two and three, it
follows that the published scientific evidence is not adequate to
permit experts to fairly and responsibly conclude that marijuana
is safe and effective for use in humans.</p>

<p>A failure to meet just one of the five points precludes a drug
from having a currently accepted medical use. Marijuana fails all
five points of the test.</p>

<p>NORML has argued, unsuccessfully, that the legal standard for
currently accepted medical use should be whether a respectable
minority of physicians accepts the drug. The key to this medical
malpractice defense is that the minority opinion must be rec
ognized as respectable, as competent, by members of the
profession.</p>

<p>In the absence of reliable evidence adequately establishing
marijuana&#146;s chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and
effectiveness, no responsible physician could conclude that
marijuana is safe and effective for medical use. To quote Doctor
Kenneth P. Johnson, Chairman of the Department of Neurology at
the University of Maryland, and the author of over 100 scientific
and medical articles on MS: &#147;To conclude that marijuana is
therapeutically effective without conducting rigorous testing
would be professionally irresponsible.&#148;</p>

<p>By any modern scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine.</p>

        his wife, Barbara Jenks.&nbsp; Mrs. Jenks' health began
        to decline rapidly.&nbsp; Her weight dropped from 150 to
        112 pounds during a three week period as a result of
        constant vomiting, and she was hospitalized at least six
        times for two to three weeks at a time. Although she had
        been prescribed over a half-dozen oral medications for
        nausea, none of them worked.&nbsp; When given shots for
        nausea, she was left in a stupor and unable to
        function.&nbsp; Like wise, when Mr. Jenks started AZT
        treatment, he was not able to eat because the medication
        left him constantly nauseous.&nbsp; He also lost weight,

        that they were able to retain their AIDS medications,
        eat, gain weight, maintain their health, and stay out of
        the hospital.&nbsp; They asked their treating physician
        about prescribing the drug, but were unable to obtain a
        legal prescription.&nbsp; The Jenks decided to grow two
        marijuana plants to insure its availability, avoid the

        paraphernalia, a violation of Section 893.147, Florida

        Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291.&nbsp; The authors state
        that the defense is poorly developed in Anglo-American
        jurisprudence because there are so few cases dealing with
        it, &quot;probably because these cases are not often
        prosecuted.&quot;&nbsp; In any event, they indicate that
        although there is some disagreement on this, &quot;it
        seems clear that necessity was a defense at common

<h1>Cannabis 1988 Old Drug, New Dangers The Potency Question</h1>

<p>*Psychiatrist and Substance Abuse Therapist, 41 Tunnel Road,
Berkeley, California 94705. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The story of the new, allegedly stronger and more dangerous
marijuana was rebirthed in January 1986 by the late Sidney Cohen,
M.D., Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA: ``. . . material ten or
more times potent than the product smoked ten years ago is being
used, and the intoxicated state is more intense and lasts
longer.&quot; In addition, Cohen (1986) asserted that ``the
amount of THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] in confiscated street
samples averaged 4.1 percent THC during 1984. </p>

<p>The sinsemilla varieties were about 7 percent with some
samples reaching 14 percent. . . . all marijuana research to date
has been done on 1 or 2 percent THC material and we may be
underestimating present day smoking practices.&quot;</p>

<p>The average potency of marijuana samples seized by the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) increased from 0.5 percent THC
in 1974 to 3.5 percent in 1985-1986, with sinsemilla (seedless
marijuana) at 6.5 to 12 percent, announced Dr. Richard Hawks of
NIDA later that year (Kerr 1986: 1). ``Parents who experimented
in their youth are not aware that the potency is much
higher,&quot; added Donald M. Delzer, Chairman of the National
Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth (Kerr 1986: 18).</p>

<p>``Now perceived as a hard drug, marijuana has increased 1,400
percent in potency since 1970,&quot; proclaimed the flyer of a
national conference on marijuana (Henry Ohlhoff Outpatient
Programs 1986). Drug abuse treatment professionals soon
elaborated on the outcry. Tennant (1986) asserted that the drug
of the 1970's contained one to three percent THC, while that of
the 1980's contained five to 15 percent. Furthermore, the brain
registers the difference exponentially, so the difference between
one percent and 10 percent THC was not nine percent, but more
like 900 percent (Garcia 1986: 3). Smith (1987) stated that Cohen
``taught us that marijuana was a lot more dangerous than we
originally thought, particularly with the use of more potent
preparations by young people.&quot; Inaba (1987) added that
``this new, stronger marijuana has a more disruptive effect on
brain chemistry and body physiology than we had imagined
previously,&quot; and mentioned heretofore undescribed side
effects among athletes: ``Baseball players who get beaned a lot
admit to smoking marijuana. It impairs their ability to follow
the ball.&quot;</p>

<p>In a column for drug abuse counselors, Meyers (1987) advised
``supportive therapy&quot; for the effects of the ``new&quot;
marijuana, which were described as ``depersonalization,
disorientation, derealization, changes in perception, and
alterations in body image . . . acute brain syndromes with
temporary clouding of mental processes . . . a change of time
sense---where minutes seem like hours---slowed thinking, and
feared perception of brain damage.&quot; Schick Shadel Health
Services drug abuse treatment clinics (Unsigned 1987) now
advertise that ``marijuana has increased THC content from one
percent THC in 1975 to six to fourteen percent THC in 1985 due to
hybridization techniques. . . . </p>

<p>For those who have become addicted to marijuana, whether it
was years ago, or recently, treatment is necessary---even more
critical today.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite the respectability of these authorities, none of these
alarming claims are new, and neither is the potency issue. There
are several claims intertwined: (1) that the marijuana available
today is much stronger than that available previously,
particularly since the early 1970's; (2) that the effects of this
so-called new marijuana are different from effects known earlier;
and (3) that all previous marijuana research has been done with
weak material and is therefore irrelevant. Before leaping on the
bandwagon, one should examine the validity of these assertions.</p>

<p>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</p>

<p>Extremely potent marijuana has been described for 150 years by
Western scientists and (with the possible exception of the
bean-ball syndrome) so have the effects of the new marijuana.
There has been a great deal of research on high-potency cannabis
in many countries. </p>

<p>In the paper that introduced cannabis to Western medicine,
O'Shaughnessy (1839) discussed the widespread social and medical
uses of ganja (sinsemilla) in India and noted symptoms of
``delirium which the incautious use of the Hemp preparations
often occasions, especially among young men first commencing the
practice.&quot; Cannabis tinctures soon appeared in Europe and
America (Robertson 1847; Savory 1843) and Fitz Hugh Ludlow (1857)
described florid psychedelic trips after their oral ingestion,
including all the symptoms mentioned by Meyers (1987). The Ohio
State Medical Society (McMeens 1860) reviewed some 15 years of
clinical experience with the drug and acknowledged the intense
but physiologically benign mental effects caused by high doses or
idiosyncratic sensitivity.</p>

<p>Wood (1869) reported the subjective effects of a tincture made
from North American marijuana, experiencing a distortion in time
sense, convulsions and memory loss, but no adverse aftereffects.
He reported considerable success with it in the treatment of
severe neuralgia. However, 15 years later Wood and Smith (1884)
commented on the variable potency of cannabis and outlined
appropriate treatment for overdoses in medical practice.</p>

<p>Early investigators (McMeens 1860; Bell 1857) attributed this
variability to ``defective pharmaceutic processes&quot; employed
in foreign countries, and recommended that extracts prepared at
home would be preferable. However, extreme variations in locally
manufactured preparations were soon recognized in the
Dispensatory of the United States (Wood &amp; Bache 1868:
379-382). A practical bioassay technique was gradually perfected
starting from the systematic observations of Hare (1887),
followed by Evans (1894) and Marshall (1898), to compensate for
batch-to-batch potency variations.</p>

<p>Pragmatically, the solution to the overdose/potency problem in
both the United States (Wood &amp; Bache 1868: 382) and England
was to titrate the dose. In London, a patient who signed a letter
to the editors of Lancet, W.W. (1890) reported a typical case:
W.W. had inadvertently been given an overdose of cannabis for
treatment of neuralgia by his doctor and had suffered perceptual
distortion, agitation, mood swings, and fear of death. Sir J.
Russell Reynolds, M.D., F.R.S., physician to Queen Victoria's
household, responded with a recommendation based on 30 years of
experience with the drug (Reynolds 1890), stating ``that Indian
hemp, when pure and administered carefully, is one of the most
valuable medicines we possess. . . . a minimum dose should be
given to begin with, and . . . the dose should be very gradually
and cautiously increased.&quot; </p>

<p>During the nineteenth century, social and scientific research
on marijuana, as well as tinctures, were conducted with much
stronger material than is available on the illicit market today.
For example, the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission of 1893-1894
investigated the social, religious and medical uses of bhang
(marijuana), ganja (sinsemilla) and charas (hashish). The
potencies of varieties from different parts of the subcontinent
were evaluated by government chemists and botanists (Evans 1894;
Hooper 1894), using the ``acknowledged superiority&quot; of
Bengal ganja as the standard. The Commission found that the
moderate use of even highly potent marijuana caused no
significant physical, mental or moral damage (Kaplan 1969;
Mikuriya 1968).</p>

<p>In the 1890's, at the peak of medical interest in the drug,
British chemists (Wood, Spivey &amp; Easterfield 1899) isolated
an impure active principle, cannabinol, using a ``red oil&quot;
distilled from Indian cannabis as a starting point, which was
considered to be the active ingredient until the 1930's (Work,
Bergel &amp; Todd 1939; Cahn 1931). In 1909, Marshall
demonstrated that oxidation during storage was the primary cause
of the drug's variable potency. With this advance the
pharmaceutical industry shifted its attention to the production
of standard extracts that could be used to assay medicinal
compounds (Colson 1920). Because it had long been known that
ganja and charas produced the most reliable extracts (Wallich
1883; Robertson 1847), in practical terms this meant the European
and American producers had to learn how to grow ganja.</p>

<p>Sinsemilla cultivation by the Indian technique of culling male
plants from the fields before female plants could set seeds---the
very process to which recent researchers attribute the potency of
the new marijuana---was exhaustively described by the British
government in India (Kaplan 1969: 59-84; Prain 1893; Kerr 1877).
In an effort to promote Bengali ganja, the British Raj imposed an
export duty on inferior Bombay ganja at the turn of the century,
and pharmacognosists in Europe and the U.S. began learning
sinsemilla cultivation (Mair 1900).</p>

<p>Holmes (1900) discussed the potencies of Calcutta and Bombay
ganja and recommended that the former be used for pharmaceutical
preparations, either by home cultivation of ganja according to
the Bengal methods he outlined (Holmes 1902a) or by extracting it
immediately in Bengal and shipping it in tightly closed
containers (Holmes 1902b). Comparing the potency of cannabis from
Uganda, France and India, Holmes (1905) urged that only Indian
sinsemilla preparations be admitted to the British Pharmacopoeia.</p>

<p>Likewise, Whineray (1909) and Hooper (1908) described ganja
cultivation and manufacture, pointing out that cannabis grown in
North America by the Indian methods could be as fully potent as
Indian hemp. The National Standard Dispensatory of 1909, which
included medicines from the pharmacopoeias of the U.S., Britain
and Germany, gave the details of sinsemilla cultivation and
featured a drawing of a perfect Calcutta ganja flower top (see
Figure 1) as an example to be emulated by Western cultivators
(Hare, Caspari &amp; Rusby 1909: 374). </p>

<p>In the U.S., Hamilton and his colleagues (Hamilton 1918;
Hamilton 1915; Hamilton, Lescohier &amp; Perkins 1913; Houghton
&amp; Hamilton 1908) demonstrated that if care was exercised in
cultivating and processing the plant for extraction,
American-grown ganja and its extracts were as reliable as those
from India and would not deteriorate significantly if stored
properly. Information on cultivation of extremely potent seedless
marijuana was thus widely disseminated to Western pharmaceutical
producers during the first two decades of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The U.S. government ignored these sensimilla cultivation
techniques at the first federal marijuana farm established in
1904 on the Potomac Flats (where the Pentagon now sits) in
Washington, D.C. (Silver 1979: 262-263), and as a result the
10-foot marijuana plants grown there and elsewhere in America
proved to be much less potent than good samples of Indian hemp
(Eckler &amp; Miller 1912). However, private pharmaceutical firms
were more successful. The Eli Lilly and Parke-Davis companies ran
a cooperative venture at Parkedale (Parke-Davis's farm near
Rochester, Michigan) from 1913 until 1938 to develop cannabis
extracts for medical use, at first from Cannabis indica, but
later standardized on a highly potent strain they developed that
they called Cannabis Americana (Wheeler 1968). </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies were marketing cannabis extracts that
were uniformly effective at 10 mg dose levels (Parke-Davis &amp;
Company 1930: 82) 11 years before its official removal from
medicinal availability. </p>

<p>In 1941, cannabis was removed from the United States
Pharmacopoeia (USP) at the behest of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, which suddenly claimed that marijuana had no medical
uses (Mikuriya 1973: xx). Yet even the removal of cannabis from
the USP did not end scientific and social research on highly
potent forms of cannabis, ranging from the red-dirt marijuana of
the Midwest to the red oil of the laboratories. Adams, Pease and
Clark (1940) described improved procedures for preparing purified
red oil from Minnesota wild hemp, and comparison of the potencies
of Minnesota marijuana and red oil was of significant interest to
Loewe, pharmacological director of the LaGuardia Committee
(Mayor's Committee on Marihuana 1944: 186ff). Red oil
concentrates were used along with marijuana in the LaGuardia </p>

<p>Committee's experiments on prisoners, under Loewe's personal
direction (Mayor's Committee on Marihuana 1944: 32); for a
subjective account see Mezzrow and Wolfe (1946: 317ff). In the
1940's, Adams and Loewe in the U.S. and Todd in England isolated
other cannabinoids, including THC, which Adams (1940) postulated
as the active principle.</p>

<p>Such isolates were the mainstay of marijuana research during
the 1940's and 1950's. A potent marijuana oil created as a truth
drug for interrogation purposes by the Office of Strategic
Services during World War II (Lee &amp; Shlain 1985: 3-5) was the
forerunner of later clandestine experiments conducted by the CIA
and the Department of Defense at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland
from the 1950's to the 1970's (Mikuriya 1973: xxii). Experiments
with the designer drug synhexyl, a potent analog of delta3-THC,
were conducted from the 1940's (Adams et al. 1941) until the
mid-1970's (Lemberger 1976; Pars &amp; Razdan 1976), but were
abandoned before its potential was fully explored.</p>

<p>In the 1960's, the identification of pure delta9-THC as the
active principle in cannabis (Gaoni &amp; Mechoulam 1964) made it
possible to assay the relative potencies of cannabinoids directly
in human subjects (Isbell et al. 1967). Although Weil, Zinberg
and Nelsen (1968) demonstrated the safety of human marijuana
research, much of the U.S. research of the 1970's was conducted
with low-potency marijuana because the government would not
approve human research with high-potency strains. Indeed, in one
early study (Jones &amp; Stone 1970), a THC concentrate was
removed from Mexican marijuana and then redistributed back into
the bulk marijuana to return its potency to 0.9 percent THC.
Outside the U.S., these strictures did not apply: The fact that
cannabidiol interferes with the effects of delta9-THC was
discovered in Brazil, using both purified cannabinoids on humans
(Karniol et al. 1974).</p>

<p>The 1960's and 1970's saw a worldwide flowering of cannabis
research, including its social, psychological, chemical,
botanical and legal aspects as well as covering an enormous range
of potencies and dosages. Major botanical work involved potency
questions: observing phenotypes at the University of Mississippi
(Fetterman et al. 1971) and in Canada (Small 1979); establishing
a lectotype for Cannabis sativa L. (Stearn 1974); distinguishing
C. sativa from C. indica and C. ruderalis (Schultes et al. 1974);
and cultivation techniques for increased THC production (Clarke
1981; Frank &amp; Rosenthal 1978). </p>

<p>Thus the claim by Cohen (1986) that ``all marijuana research
to date has been done on 1 or 2 percent THC material&quot; is not
accurate for the 1970's or for any other decade going back to
1839. It ignores much of the laboratory research in the U.S. that
was summarized by Cohen himself (Cohen &amp; Stillman 1976),
Hollister (1986) and the National Academy of Sciences (1982), and
all of the social research on high-potency marijuana in Jamaica
(Rubin &amp; Comitas 1975; Bowman &amp; Pihl 1973), Costa Rica
(Carter &amp; Doughty 1976), Greece (Fink et al. 1976) and Africa
(DuToit 1980). It is difficult to think of any country in which
the claim is true.</p>

<p>RECENT ESTIMATES OF POTENCY</p>

<p>Since the advent of quantitative analysis technology, there
has been sporadic reportage of the percentage of delta9-THC and
other cannabinoids in natural and semisynthetic cannabis
products. Notwithstanding the psychophysical effects of other
cannabinoids, the amount of THC present in a marijuana sample is
believed to determine the drug's potency (National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse 1972: 50), and potency is usually
expressed in percent THC by weight. The results of quantitative
analyses performed on street samples of marijuana have been
published since the late 1960's. These results are generally
higher than the alleged 0.5 percent THC content of marijuana
cited for the early 1970's.</p>

<p>Lerner and Zeffert (1968) described the development of
quantitative analysis for the determination of THC content, and
noted much variation among samples of marijuana, hashish, and red
oil (still being used experimentally in the 1960's). The THC
content of confiscated Mexican marijuana was 0.8 to 1.4 percent,
hashish averaged eight percent and red oil 31 percent in 1968.</p>

<p>Quantitative analyses of street samples of marijuana and
hashish conducted by Canadian laboratories in 1971 for the
Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs (1972:
28-29) showed a range of 0.02 to 3.46 percent THC (median=0.93%)
for marijuana, with hashish ranging from 1.0 to 14.3 percent THC
(median=4.82%). Samples seized in police raids were less potent:
marijuana was 0.05 to 1.65 percent THC (median=0.21%), while
hashish was 0.0 to 8.6 percent THC (median=1.3%). The reported
difference between confiscated police seizures and street samples
submitted to laboratories for analysis may be due to the
voluntary samples being submitted precisely because of their
extraordinary potency, or that storage conditions in police
evidence lockers are hardly optimal for potency stability.</p>

<p>This has a bearing on the potency question because the low
potency cited by both Cohen (1986) and Hawks (see Kerr 1986)
referred to samples confiscated by the DEA. It has been known
since the early days of its isolation (Wollner et al. 1942) that
THC oxidizes to cannabinol rapidly in samples stored at room
temperature (24oC). Lerner (1963) reported that the concentration
of THC in marijuana decreased at a rate of three to five percent
under normal room conditions, and Razdan (1970) reported a rate
of 10 percent per month. </p>

<p>The influence of temperature, light and age on potency was
addressed by Starks (1977: 13-15). The low-baseline percentage of
THC reported for the early 1970's may be due to this
deterioration in confiscated, stored samples. In any case, the
low baseline makes the difference in the THC content of
later-reported samples appear much greater than it may have been
in actuality, assuming that the marijuana smoked by consumers was
fresher than stored police seizures.</p>

<p>For a short while in the early 1970's, PharmChem Laboratories
in Palo Alto, California, tested and reported the percent of the
THC content in anonymously submitted marijuana samples. For 1973,
PharmChem reported an average THC content of 1.62 percent in
marijuana, compared with hashish at 4.6 percent and hash oil (a
refined extract of hashish) at 13.5 percent (Ratcliffe 1974). </p>

<p>In 1974, the DEA published guidelines that no longer allowed
laboratories to provide quantitative results directly to the
sample donors. This, in effect, restricted public access to
analysis information to whatever government officials wished to
reveal. However, nonspecific summaries of THC percentage ranges
were allowed to be published (Unsigned 1974).</p>

<p>The results of an independent examination of gas-liquid
chromatographs of street samples of marijuana from California
that were submitted to PharmChem during 1973 and 1974 are shown
in Table I. </p>

<p>Seeded varieties ranged in THC from an average of 2.2 percent
(Mexican) to 4.9 percent (Panama Red), while sinsemilla averaged
2.8 percent for Big Sur ``Holy Weed&quot; to above six percent
for Thai Sticks and Hawaiian ``Maui Wowie.&quot; This would
appear to be a much more representative sample of the types of
marijuana available in California in 1973-1974 than the
half-percent grade cited by Cohen (1986) and Hawks (see Kerr
1986), or the one to three percent grade cited by Tennant (1986).</p>

<p>A retrospective summary of street-drug analysis trends from
1969 through 1975 published by PharmChem (Perry 1977) confirms
the fact that quite potent forms of cannabis were available on
the illicit U.S. market by 1975: ``Early quantitative work showed
a range of 1.0-2.5 percent THC for average marijuana. In 1975,
the range was 1.0-2.5 percent; samples in the range of 5.0-10.0
percent were not uncommon, and some contained as much as 14.0
percent THC. . . . Hash oil (concentrated from hash, usually
amber or red in color) and grass oil (from marijuana, dark green
or black in color) . . . vary greatly in potency, some samples
[containing] up to 40 percent THC.&quot; Abundant information on
the comparative potencies of cannabis grown in the U.S. and other
countries in the mid-1970's was summarized by Starks (1977:
41-87).</p>

<p>In the spring of another election year, 1980, Cohen and DuPont
launched a similar campaign, stating that confiscated marijuana
in 1975 contained only 0.4 percent THC, while in 1979 the average
was four percent, a 10-fold increase (Brody 1980: C1). This data
conflicts directly with that published by PharmChem for 1975
street samples (Perry 1977) and that shown in Table I. Perhaps
one should be thankful that, according to these estimates,
marijuana potency dropped from four percent THC in 1979 to 3.5
percent THC in 1986 (Kerr 1986). </p>

<p>The most recent comparison of cannabis potencies was compiled
from published sources from 1972 through 1981 by the National
Academy of Sciences (1982: 16), and is summarized in Table II. It
again demonstrates the great range of products available legally
(i.e., NIDA samples) and illegally during that decade, and may in
fact underestimate some potencies. For example, the 2.8 percent
THC content cited for Jamaican ganja (Marshman, Popham &amp;
Yawney 1976) is slightly lower than the mean 2.96 percent THC
material studied by Rubin and Comitas in 1970 through 1972
(Unsigned 1973), and significantly lower than the four to eight
percent THC Jamaican ganja cited by the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse (1972: 50).</p>

<p>The government ``research harvests&quot; in Table II
(Rosenkrantz 1981) are considerably less potent than the
sinsemilla samples that averaged three to 11 percent THC (Turner
1981, 1980). Perhaps this is because cultivators at the
government marijuana farm at the University of Mississippi, like
their predecessors in 1904, never learned proper sinsemilla
cultivation (Turner et al. 1979), while illicit cultivators in
California and Hawaii were making it standard for the industry
(Frank &amp; Rosenthal 1978: 258-259). If so, this alone could
explain the wide discrepancies between the potency of marijuana
reported by government sources and that actually being grown in
the U.S. during the 1970's and 1980's.</p>

<p>SELF-ADJUSTMENT OF DOSE</p>

<p>An important consideration in regard to the potency issue is
autotitration, the adjustment of dose by the individual user to
obtain optimal effects and avoid unpleasant ones. As noted above,
cautious titration of dose was standard practice when cannabis
preparations were used in medicine. Smoking marijuana, customary
in present social use of the drug, requires knowledge of when to
stop in order to avoid symptoms of overdose. The smoked route
gives rapid feedback to the user with regard to levels of effect
because the drug goes directly to the brain from the lungs,
unimpeded by the gut or the liver.</p>

<p>Researchers for the Mayor's Committee on Marihuana (1944: 13)
were among the first to notice that experienced marijuana smokers
in the ``tea-pads&quot; of Harlem routinely practiced
autotitration. The confirmed user, they noted, ``appears to be
quite conscious of the quantity he requires to reach the effect
called `high.' Once the desired effect is obtained he cannot be
persuaded to consume more. He knows when he has had enough . . .
and is ever-conscious of preventing himself from becoming `too
high.'&quot; Similarly the Commission of Inquiry into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs (1972: 48) observed that ``great
variations in potency are usually accommodated by the experienced
user through a `titration' of dose (intake is reduced or stopped
when the smoker reaches the preferred level of
intoxication).&quot; For U.S. users, the National Commission on
Marihuana and Drug Abuse (1972: 166) commented: ``. . . whatever
the potency of the drug used, individuals tend to smoke only the
amount necessary to achieve the desired effect.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<p>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</p>

<p>Observation of the real world of social marijuana use, where
autotitration is the norm, renders the scare tactics of the new
marijuana proponents not only inaccurate but irrelevant. There is
much published evidence about the availability of highly potent
varieties of cannabis from the nineteenth century through the
present day. The effects attributed to the new marijuana are the
same ones debated for centuries in many different cultures. The
assertion that ``all marijuana research to date has been done on
1 or 2 percent THC material&quot; (Cohen 1968) ignores several
thousand years of human experience with the drug. The old medical
cannabis extracts were stronger than most of the forms now
available, though the potency of illicit hash oils by the
mid-1970's was approaching the level of medicinal preparations
available before their removal from the USP.</p>

<p>While it may be true that sinsemilla is more widely available
than 10 or 15 years ago, its potency has not changed
significantly from the 2.4 to 9.5 percent THC materials available
in 1973-1974 (see Table I), or the five to 14 percent sinsemilla
of 1975 (Perry 1977). </p>

<p>The range of potencies available then (marijuana at 0.1% to
7.8% THC, averaging 2.0% to 5.0% THC by 1975) was approximately
the same as that reported now. With such a range, the evidence
simply cannot support the argument by Cohen (1986) that marijuana
is ``ten or more times more potent than the product smoked ten
years ago.&quot; And to say that marijuana potency has increased
1,400 percent since any date in history is patent nonsense.</p>

<p>It is not legitimate to imply that average low potencies
represent the full range of potencies available in reality.
Neither is it valid to cite the low end of the range then as a
baseline to compare with the high end of the range now. The
claimed baseline for THC content in the early 1970's would appear
to be too low, probably because confiscated, stored police
samples were utilized; and this low baseline makes the claimed
difference in potency appear to be greater than it has been in
reality.</p>

<p>In sum, the new marijuana is not new and neither is the
hyperbole surrounding this issue. The implications of the new
disinformation campaign are serious. Many people, particularly
the experienced users of the 1960's and their children, will once
again shrug off the warnings of drug experts and not heed more
reasonable admonishments about more dangerous drugs. This is not
only abusive to those who look to science, the medical
profession, and government for intelligent leadership, but will
sully the reputations of drug educators who wittingly cry wolf,
and will inevitably diminish the credibility of drug abuse
treatment professionals who pass on such flawed reports. </p>

<p>Medicine in the Western World has forgotten almost all it once
knew about therapeutic properties of marijuana, or cannabis. </p>

<p>Analgesia, anticonvulsant action, appetite stimulation,
ataraxia, antibiotic properties and low toxicity were described
throughout medical literature, beginning in 1839, when
O'Shaughnessy introduced cannabis into the Western pharmacopoeia.
</p>

<p>As these findings were reported throughout Western medicine,
cannabis attained wide use. Cannabis therapy was described in
most pharmacopoeial texts as a treatment for a variety of disease
conditions. </p>

<p>During the second half of the 1800s and in the present
century, medical researchers in some measure corroborated the
early reports of the therapeutic potential of cannabis. In
addition, much laboratory research has been concerned with
bioassay, determination of the mode of action, and attempts to
solve the problems of insolubility in water and variability of
strength among different cannabis specimens. </p>

<p>&quot;Recreational&quot; smoking of cannabis in the twentieth
century and the resultant restrictive federal legislation have
functionally ended all medical uses of marijuana. </p>

<p>In light of such assets as minimal toxicity, no buildup of
tolerance, no physical dependence, and minimal autonomic
disturbance, immediate major clinical reinvestigation of cannabis
preparations is indicated in the management of pain, chronic
neurologic diseases, convulsive disorders, migraine headache,
anorexia, mental illness, and bacterial infections. </p>

<p>Recently declassified secret U.S. Defense Department studies
reconfirm marijuana's congeners to have therapeutic utility. </p>

<p>Cannabis indica, Cannabis sativa, Cannabis americana, Indian
hemp and marijuana (or marihuana) all refer to the same plant.
Cannabis is used throughout the world for diverse purposes and
has a long history characterized by usefulness, euphoria or
evil--depending on one's point of view. To the agriculturist
cannabis is a fiber crop; to the physician of a century ago it
was a valuable medicine; to the physician of today it is an
enigma; to the user, a euphoriant; to the police, a menace; to
the traffickers, a source of profitable danger; to the convict or
parolee and his family, a source of sorrow. </p>

<p>This book is concerned primarily with the medicinal aspects of
cannabis. </p>

<p>The Chinese emperor Shen-nung is reported to have taught his
people to grow hemp for fiber in the twenty-eighth century B.C. A
text from the period 1500-1200 B.C. documents a knowledge of the
plant in China- -but not for use as fiber. In 200 A.D., the use
of cannabis as an analgesic was described by the physician
Hoa-tho.[44] </p>

<p>The Chinese emperor Shen-nung is reported to have taught his
people to grow hemp for fiber in the twenty-eighth century B.C. A
text from the period 1500-1200 B.C. documents a knowledge of the
plant in China- -but not for use as fiber. In 200 A.D., the use
of cannabis as an analgesic was described by the physician
Hoa-tho.[44] </p>

<p>In India the use of hemp preparations as a remedy was
described before 1000 B.C. In Persia, cannabis was known several
centuries before Christ. In Assyria, about 650 B.C., its
intoxicating properties were noted.[44] </p>

<p>Except for Herodotus' report that the Scythians used the smoke
from burning hemp seeds for intoxication, the ancient Greeks
seemed to be unaware of the psychoactive properties of cannabis.
Dioscorides in the first century A.D. rendered an accurate
morphologic description of the plant, but made no note of
intoxicating properties.[10] </p>

<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Arabic writers
described the social use of cannabis and resultant cruel but
unsuccessful attempts to suppress its non-medical use.[44] </p>

<p>Although Galen described the use of the seeds for creating
warmth, he did not describe the intoxicating qualities of hemp.
Of interest is the paucity of references to hemp's intoxicating
properties in the lay and medical literature of Europe before the
1800s.[44] </p>

<p>The therapeutic use of cannabis was introduced into Western
medicine in 1839, in a forty-page article by W. B. O'Shaughnessy,
a thirty- year-old physician serving with the British in
India.[27] His discussion of the history of the use of cannabis
products in the East reveals an awareness that these drugs had
not only been used in medicine for therapeutic purposes, but had
also been used for recreational and religious purposes. </p>

<p>O'Shaughnessy is not primarily known for his discovery of hemp
drugs, but rather for his basic studies on intravenous
electrolyte therapy in 1831, and his introduction of the
telegraph into India in the 1850s.[26] </p>

<p>After studying the literature on cannabis and conferring with
contemporary Hindu and Mohammedan scholars O'Shaughnessy tested
the effects of various hemp preparations on animals, before
attempting to use them to treat humans. Satisfied that the drug
was reasonably safe, he administered preparations of cannabis
extract to patients, and discovered that it had analgesic and
sedative properties. O'Shaughnessy successfully relieved the pain
of rheumatism and stilled the convulsions of an infant with this
strange new drug. His most spectacular success came, however,
when he quelled the wrenching muscle spasms of tetanus and rabies
with the fragrant resin. Psychic effects resembling a curious
delirium, when an overdose was given, were treated with strong
purgatives, emetics with a blister to the nape of the neck, and
leeches on the temples.[27] </p>

<p>The use of cannabis derivatives for medicinal purposes spread
rapidly throughout Western medicine, as is evidenced in the
report of the Committee on Cannabis Indica of the Ohio State
Medical Society, published in 1860. In that report physicians
told of success in treating stomach pain, childbirth psychosis,
chronic cough, and gonorrhea with hemp products.[25] A Dr.
Fronmueller, of Fuerth, Ohio, summarized his experiences with the
drug as follows: </p>

<p>I have used hemp many hundred times to relieve local pains of
an inflammatory as well as neuralgic nature, and judging from
these experiments, I have to assign to the Indian hemp a place
among the so-called hypnotic medicines next to opium; its effects
are less intense, and the secretions are not so much suppressed
by it. Digestion is not disturbed; the appetite rather increased;
sickness of the stomach seldom induced; congestion never. Hemp
may consequently be employed in inflammatory conditions. It
disturbs the expectoration far less than opium; the nervous
system is also not so much affected. The whole effect of hemp
being less violent, and producing a more natural sleep, without
interfering with the actions of the internal organs, it is
certainly often preferable to opium, although it is not equal to
that drug in strength and reliability. An alternating course of
opium and Indian hemp seems particularly adapted to those cases
where opium alone fails in producing the desired effect.[25] </p>

<p>Because cannabis did not lead to physical dependence, it was
found to be superior to the opiates for a number of therapeutic
purposes. Birch, in 1889, reported success in treating opiate and
chloral addiction with cannabis,[5] and Mattison in 1891
recommended its use to the young physician, comparing it
favorably with the opiates. He quoted his colleague Suckling: </p>

<p>With a wish for speedy effect, it is so easy to use that
modern mischief-maker, hypodermic morphia, that they [young
physicians] are prone to forget remote results of incautious
opiate giving. </p>

<p>Would that the wisdom which has come to their professional
fathers through, it may be, a hapless experience, might serve
them to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient
has gone awreck. </p>

<p>Indian hemp is not here lauded as a specific. It will, at
times, fail. So do other drugs. But the many cases in which it
acts well, entitle it to a large and lasting confidence. </p>

<p>My experience warrants this statement: cannabis indica is,
often, a safe and successful anodyne and hypnotic.[23] </p>

<p>In their study of the medical applications of cannabis,
physicians of the nineteenth century repeatedly encountered a
number of difficulties. Recognizing the therapeutic potential of
the drug, many experimenters sought ways of overcoming these
drawbacks to its use in medicine, in particular the following: </p>

<p>Cannabis products are insoluble in water. </p>

<p>The onset of the effects of medicinal preparations of cannabis
takes an hour or so; its action is therefore slower than that of
many other drugs. </p>

<p>Different batches of cannabis derivatives vary greatly in
strength; moreover, the common procedure for standardization of
cannabis samples, by administration to test animals, is subject
to error owing to variability of reactions among the animals. </p>

<p>There is wide variation among humans in their individual
responses to cannabis. </p>

<p>Despite these problems regarding the uncertainty of potency
and dosage and the difficulties in mode of administration,
cannabis has several important advantages over other substances
used as analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotics: </p>

<p>The prolonged use of cannabis does not lead to the development
of physical dependence. [11, 13, 14, 24, 39, 44] </p>

<p>There is minimal development of tolerance to cannabis
products. (Loewe notes a slight &quot;beginner's
habituation&quot; in dogs, during the first few trials with the
drug, as the only noticeable tolerance effect.[20]) [11, 13, 14,
24, 44] </p>

<p>Cannabis products have exceedingly low toxicity.[9, 21, 22,
24] (The oral dose required to kill a mouse has been found to be
about 40,000 times the dose required to produce typical symptoms
of intoxication in man.)[21] </p>

<p>Cannabis produces no disturbance of vegetative functioning,
whereas the opiates inhibit the gastrointestinal tract, the flow
of bile and the cough reflex.[1, 2, 24, 44, 46] </p>

<p>Besides investigating the physical effects of medicinal
preparations of cannabis, nineteenth-century physicians observed
the psychic effects of the drug in its therapeutic
applications.[4, 27, 33] They found that cannabis first mildly
stimulates, and then sedates the higher centers of the brain.
Hare suggested in 1887 a possible mechanism of cannabis'
analgesic properties: </p>

<p>During the time that this remarkable drug is relieving pain a
very curious psychical condition manifests itself; namely, that
the diminution of the pain seems to be due to its fading away in
the distance, so that the pain becomes less and less, just as the
pain in a delicate ear would grow less and less as a beaten drum
was carried farther and farther out of the range of hearing. </p>

<p>This condition is probably associated with the other well-
known symptom produced by the drug; namely, the prolongation of
time.[16] </p>

<p>Reynolds, in 1890,[33] summed up thirty years of his clinical
experience using cannabis, finding it useful as a nocturnal
sedative in senile insomnia, and valuable in treating
dysmenorrhea, neuralgias including tic douloureux and tabetic
symptoms, migraine headache and certain epileptoid or choreoid
muscle spasms. He felt it to be of uncertain benefit in asthma,
alcoholic delirium and depressions. Reynolds thought cannabis to
be of no value in joint pains that were aggravated by motion and
in cases of true chronic epilepsy. </p>

<p>Reynolds stressed the necessity of titrating the dose of each
patient, increasing gradually every third or fourth day, to avoid
&quot;toxic&quot; effects: </p>

<p>The dose should be given in minimum quantity, repeated in not
less than four or six hours, and gradually increased by one drop
every third or fourth day, until either relief is obtained, or
the drug is proved, in such case, to be useless. With these
precautions I have never met with any toxic effects, and have
rarely failed to find, after a comparatively short time, either
the value or the uselessness of the drug.[33] </p>

<p>Concerning migraine headache, Osler stated in his text:
Cannabis indica is probably the most satisfactory remedy.[11, 28]
</p>

<p>In his definitive survey of the literature and report of his
own studies, deceptively titled &quot;Marihuana, America's New
Drug Problem,&quot; Walton notes that cannabis was widely used
during the latter half of the nineteenth century, and
particularly before new drugs were developed: </p>

<p>This popularity of the hemp drugs can be attributed partly to
the fact that they were introduced before the synthetic hypnotics
and analgesics. Chloral hydrate was not introduced until 1869 and
was followed in the next thirty years by paraldehyde, sulfonal
and the barbitals. Antipyrine and acetanilide, the first of their
particular group of analgesics, were introduced about 1884. For
general sedative and analgesic purposes, the only drugs commonly
used at this time were the morphine derivatives and their
disadvantages were very well known. In fact, the most attractive
feature of the hemp narcotics was probably the fact that they did
not exhibit certain of the notorious disadvantages of the
opiates. The hemp narcotics do not constipate at all, they more
often increase than decrease appetite, they do not particularly
depress the respiratory center even in large doses, they rarely
or never cause pruritis or cutaneous eruptions and, most
important, the liability of developing addiction is very much
less than with opiates.[44] </p>

<p>The use of cannabis in American medicine was seriously
affected by the increased use of opiates in the latter half of
the nineteenth century. With the introduction of the hypodermic
syringe into American medicine from England in 1856 by Barker and
Ruppaner, the use of the faster acting, water-soluble opiate
drugs rapidly increased. The Civil War helped to spread the use
of opiates in this country; the injected drugs were administered
widely--and often indiscriminately--to relieve the pain of maimed
soldiers returning from combat. (Opiate addiction was once called
the &quot;army disease.&quot;[41]) As the use of injected opiates
increased, cannabis declined in popularity. </p>

<p>Cannabis preparations were still widely available in legend
and over-the-counter forms in the 1930s. Crump (Chairman,
Investigating Committee, American Medical Association) in 1931
mentioned the proprietaries &quot;Piso's Cure,&quot; &quot;One
Day Cough Cure&quot; and &quot;Neurosine&quot; as containing
cannabis.[44] In 1937 Sasman listed twenty-eight pharmaceuticals
containing cannabis.[36] Cannabis was still recognized as a
medicinal agent in that year, when the committee on legislative
activities of the American Medical Association concluded as
follows: </p>

<p>. . . there is positively no evidence to indicate the abuse of
cannabis as a medicinal agent or to show that its medicinal use
is leading to the development of cannabis addiction. Cannabis at
the present time is slightly used for medicinal purposes, but it
would seem worthwhile to maintain its status as a medicinal agent
for such purposes as it now has. There is a possibility that a
re-study of the drug by modern means may show other advantages to
be derived from its medicinal use.[32] </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Mexico, the poor were smoking marijuana to relax
and to endure heat and fatigue. (Originally marijuana was the
Mexican slang word for the smoking preparation of dried leaves
and flowering tops of the Cannabis sativa plant--the indigenous
variety of the hemp plant.) </p>

<p>The recreational smoking of marijuana may have started in this
country in New Orleans in about 1910, and continued on a small
scale there until 1926, when a newspaper ran a six-part series on
the use of the drug.[44] The fad subsequently spread up the
Mississippi and throughout the United States, faster than local
and state laws could be passed to discourage it. The use of
&quot;tea&quot; or &quot;muggles&quot; blossomed into a minor
&quot;psychedelic revolution&quot; of the 1920s. Narcotics
officers encouraged the enactment of local prohibitory laws and
eventually succeeded in bringing about restrictive Federal
legislation. In 1937 Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act, the
finale to a series of prohibitory acts in the individual states.
Under the new laws, the already dwindling use of cannabis as a
therapeutic substance in medicine was brought to a virtual halt.
In 1941, cannabis was dropped from the &quot;National Formulary
and Pharmacopoeia.&quot; </p>

<p>Around the time of the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act,
Walton postulated sites of action for cannabis drugs. Cortical
areas, he found, are affected at low dosage, while at high dosage
there seems to be a depressant effect on the thalamo-cortical
pathways. Hyperemia of the brain appears to be a local
phenomenon, unless centers controlling vasodilation might be
located in the thalamo-cortical region. Similar possible
mechanisms are suggested for the phenomenon of mild hypoglycemia,
usual hunger and thirst and occasional lacrimation and
nausea.[44] </p>

<p>Despite restrictive legislation, a few medical researchers
have had the opportunity to continue the investigation of the
therapeutic applications of cannabis in recent years. In his
study of the medical applications of cannabis for Mayor La
Guardia's committee, Dr. Samuel Allentuck reported, among other
findings, favorable results in treating withdrawal of opiate
addicts with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a powerful purified
product of the hemp plant.[1, 24] </p>

<p>An article in 1949, buried in a journal of chemical abstracts,
reported that a substance related to THC controlled epileptic
seizures in a group of children more effectively than
diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin(R)), a most commonly prescribed
anticonvulsant.[9] </p>

<p>A number of experimenters, believing that cannabis products
might be of value in psychiatry, have investigated the
applications of various forms of them in the treatment of mental
disorders. Cannabis had been used in the nineteenth century to
treat mental illness.[19, 25, 45, 46] However, aside from some
rather equivocal clinical studies, primarily in the treatment of
depression,[29, 30, 35, 39] and another report of success in
treating withdrawal from alcohol and opiate addiction,[42] no
significant contemporary psychiatric studies involving cannabis
therapy have been reported to date. </p>

<p>Many current &quot;authoritative&quot; publications
unequivocally state that there is no legitimate medical use for
marijuana. As compared with the 1800s, this century has seen very
little medical research on the array of some twenty chemicals
that are found in the hemp plant.[37] </p>

<p>Today's readers may tend to be skeptical about a report of a
cure for gonorrhea published over a century ago.[19, 25] Such
findings may bear reinvestigation, however, in the light of a
report from Czechoslovakia in 1960 that cannabidiolic acid, a
product of the unripe hemp plant, has bacteriocidal
properties.[7] Some of the therapeutic applications reported in
the early medical papers have been corroborated by later
investigators, but for the most part the therapeutic aspects of
cannabis remain to be re-explored under modern clinical
conditions. </p>

<p>In the past twenty years, clinical and basic research on
cannabis have dwindled to practically nothing. The record of tax
stamps issued by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics for cannabis
research, as compared with those for research on narcotic drugs,
tells the story of the twenty-year &quot;drought&quot; in the
investigation of cannabis products:[43] </p>

<p>The rising non-medical use of marijuana both floated and was
buoyed by the &quot;psychedelic revolution&quot; of the mid
1960s. The panicked reaction included a renewed scientific
interest in the drug. </p>

<p>Eleven studies funded by the National Institute of Mental
Health 1967 concerning cannabis were either specialized animal
experiments, part of an observational sociologic study of a
number of drugs, or explorations of chemical detection methods.
No human studies were included. </p>

<p>Of the fifty-six projects funded during the next fiscal years
1968-69 only two used humans.[52] The next year was somewhat less
cautious with eight out of thirty-five projects devoted to
clinical studies.[53] </p>

<p>Some of the preliminary results are in from these studies.
Much is still unpublished. </p>

<p>According to Harris, the toxicity factor of marijuana
derivatives is over two hundred and that chronic smoking of
marijuana is less harmful to the lungs than tobacco
cigarettes.[49] </p>

<p>Domino described the cross tolerance of THC and alcohol in
pigeons[47] corroborating Jones' clinical observations.[50, 51]
These rediscoveries demand therapeutic trial. </p>

<p>In August 1971 certain secret Defense Department documents
were declassified. While at NIMH as a consulting research
psychiatrist in 1967 I had become aware of the existence of
clandestine research at Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. </p>

<p>From 1954-59 Dr. Van M. Sim was in charge of the project. He
reported to &quot;Medical World News:&quot; &quot;Marijuana . . .
is probably the most potent anti-epileptic known to medicine
today.&quot;[49] </p>

<p>Dr. Harold F. Hardman, then with the Defense contracting group
at the University of Michigan's Department of Pharmacology
reported effects of profound hypothermia and felt marijuana
derivatives to be potentially quite useful in brain and traumatic
surgery.[48] </p>

<p>The principal focus was, however, on the possible use of THC
homologs as incapacitating agents. Besides the aforementioned
government agency and university, the private sector was
represented by the Arthur D. Little Company of Cambridge,
Massachusetts.[55] </p>

<p>Recently in the course of a study of effects on driving, it
was incidentally discovered that cannabis lowers intraocular
pressure, thus being possibly useful in the treatment of
glaucoma.[56] </p>

<p>Thus, a helix is made. Modern technologic methods confirm
O'Shaughnessy's observations 130 years ago. After swinging away
from the knowledge of marijuana's properties through the worship
of new synthetics, an unrelated rise of marijuana use socially,
illegalization and removal from availability for clinical use,
medicine rediscovers marijuana. </p>

<p>The flame of knowledge is at a low ebb, kept alive by isolated
scientists and clinicians; it is now being rekindled by these
recent circumscribed revelations. </p>

<p>Unless existing restrictive state and federal laws governing
marijuana are changed, there will be no future for either modern
scientific investigation or controlled clinical trial by
present-day methods. </p>

<p>The tide is turning. The Federal Bureau of Narcotic and
Dangerous Drugs, National Institute of Mental Health and The Food
and Drug Administration Joint Committee recently authorized human
therapeutic trial of cannabis products. We may now look forward
to reinvestigation of the numerous possible medical uses of
marijuana.[54] </p>

<p>A concerted effort is indicated for full-scale investigations
where knowledge is lacking. Acute and chronic effects of cannabis
should be restudied by modern methods. Metabolic pathways of
action and detoxification need exploration by the pharmaceutical
means of today. Chronic toxicity studies must be undertaken to
examine possible long- term effects of cannabis use. (Cunningham
in 1893 found no gross central nervous system changes with
chronic administration of hemp drugs to primates over several
months.[8]) </p>

<p>Medical science must again confront the problems of cannabis'
insolubility in water and its variable strength. Since human and
animal responses vary a great deal, individual doses must be
titrated. The popular &quot;double blind&quot; type of study
methods will require revision. The reporting of personal drug
experience was once acceptable to the scientific community.[15,
22, 25, 29, 34, 39, 44] Humans who are drug
&quot;sophisticates&quot; will again become indispensable to
psychoactive drug research, as wine tasters are to the wine
industry, for only humans can verbally report the subtle and
complex effects of these substances. </p>

<p>Government agencies having stimulated little significant
clinical research in this field, the pharmaceutical industry
should take the initiative in starting basic research and
clinical studies into the purified congeners of cannabis for
their chemical properties, pharmacologic qualities and
therapeutic applications. </p>

<p>&quot;Possible Therapeutic Applications of
Tetrahydrocannabinols and Like Products&quot; </p>

<p>Analgesic-hypnotic [16, 18, 19, 23, 25, 27,33, 45]<br>
Appetite stimulant [18, 25, 27]<br>
Antiepileptic-antispasmodic [9, 18, 27, 33, 40, 45, 49]<br>
Prophylactic and treatment of the neuralgias, including migraine
and tic douloureux [3, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 28, 31, 33, 38,
40, 45]<br>
Antidepressant-tranquilizer [6, 16, 18, 19, 23, 25, 31, 33, 40,
45]<br>
Antiasthmatic [18, 25, 45]<br>
Oxytocic [25, 45]<br>
Antitussive [3, 16, 25, 38, 45]<br>
Topical anesthetic [8]<br>
Withdrawal agent for opiate and alcohol addiction [5, 23, 24, 38,
42, 45, 47, 50, 51]<br>
Childbirth analgesic [12]<br>
Antibiotic [7]<br>
Intraocular hypotensive [56]<br>
Hypothermogenic [48]<br>
</p>

<p>Medicine, being an empiric art, has not hesitated in the past
to utilize a substance first used for recreational purposes,
(Morton &quot;discovered&quot; ether for anesthetic purposes
after observing medical students at &quot;ether frolics&quot; in
1846. [Howard W. Haggard: &quot;Devils, Drugs and Doctors,&quot;
Harper and Row, New York, 1929, p. 99.]) in the pursuit of the
more noble purposes of healing, relieving pain and teaching us
more of the workings of the human mind and body. The active
constituents of cannabis appear to have remarkably low acute and
chronic toxicity factors and might be quite useful in the
management of many chronic disease conditions. More reasonable
laws and regulations controlling psychoactive drug research are
required to permit significant medical inquiry to begin so that
we can fill the large gaps in our knowledge of cannabis. </p>

<h1>Cannabis as an Adjunctive Treatment for AIDS Related Illness.
</h1>

<p><b>By Tod Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19"><br>
</p>

<p>Ken D. is in a protracted war. For the last nine years this
thirty eight year old married mainframe computer programmer with
a degree in accounting has fought the human immunodefficiency
virus in his body one skirmish, one battle at a time. He is a
long term survivor, beating the odds. A wiry intelligent man with
a neatly trimmed beard to hide the lesions of Kaposi's Sarcoma,
KS, a form of cancer with many small colonies growing slowly in
his skin and mouth with itching and discolored patches. His beard
also protects from irritating the inflammation of the skin
erupting from the side effects of medications.<br>
</p>

<p>Ken also holds a fungal pneumonia at bay. Pneumocystis
Carinii, a fungus that is found most everywhere, including normal
healthy lungs without causing symptoms, hecomes invasive and
toxic when the immune system is weakened. This is one of many
opportunistic infectious diseases taking advantage of a weakened
immune system. <br>
</p>

<p>He wishes he could work but the terms of his disability status
would cost him his benefits that see him through his periods of
immobilization. The chemotherapies are specific poisons to target
specific enzyme systems of the cancer cells or the fungus but are
debilitating to the body. A major symptom is loss of appetite.
Anorexia is a major threat to the body when fighting these
invaders. In order to summon the strength to stimulate the immune
system to resist, there must be nourishment. Otherwise, the body
must consume itself to support the immune system. Ths loss of
appetite, and thus weight, represents a major threat to survival.
The weakness from inadequate nutrition leads to immobilization,
stasis, and other complications. <br>
</p>

<p>Many of the therapeutic agents cause anorexia as a side
effect, further suppressing an already poor appetite. <br>
</p>

<p>Ken had used cannabis 20 years but only occasionally in social

<h1>Cannabis as an Adjunctive Treatment for AIDS Related Illness.
</h1>

<p><b>Part 2</b> </p>

<p><b>By Tod Mikuriya</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>I interviewed Ken at the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club,
an illegal medical speakeasy where he comes to buy his marijuana.
</p>

<p>Ken D. is in a protracted war. For the last nine years this
thirty eight year old married mainframe computer programmer with
a degree in accounting has fought the human immunodefficiency
virus in his body one skirmish, one battle at a time. He is a
long term survivor, beating the odds. A wiry intelligent man with
a neatly trimmed beard to hide the lesions of Kaposi's Sarcoma,
KS, a form of cancer with many small colonies growing slowly in
his skin and mouth with itching and discolored patches. His beard
also protects from irritating the inflammation of the skin
erupting from the side effects of medications. </p>

<p>Mycosis Fungoides is another cancer that primarily affects the
skin. Colonies of T lymphocyte type white blood cells turned
cancerous by viruses they ingested grow slowly causing intense
itching. They are killed off by low level localized radiation and
chemotherapy. </p>

<p>Ken also holds a fungal pneumonia at bay. Pneumocystis
Carinii, a fungus that is found most everywhere, including normal
healthy lungs without causing symptoms, becomes invasive and
toxic when the immune system is weakened. This is one of many
opportunistic infectious diseases taking advantage of a weakened
immune system. </p>

<p>Oral &quot;thrush&quot;, another opportunistic infection from
the yeast Monilia, causes recurrent sore throat which also
decreases food intake. </p>

<p>He wishes he could work but the terms of his disability status
would cost him his benefits that see him through his periods of
immobilization. The chemotherapies are specific designer poisons
to target specific enzyme systems of the cancer cells or the
fungus but are debilitating to the body. A major symptom is loss
of appetite. Anorexia is a major threat to the body when fighting
these invaders. In order to summon the strength to stimulate the
immune system to resist, there must be nourishment. Otherwise,
the body must consume itself to support the immune system. Thus
loss of appetite, and thus weight, represents a major threat to
survival. </p>

<p>The weakness from inadequate nutrition leads to
immobilization, stasis, and other complications. Ken, in his
fight against depression, a major component, finds cannabis to be
an effective ally as both an appetite stimulant and
antidepressant. The itching from the KS and MF, however, is
intensified by cannabis, reports Ken, because it makes him more
aware of it. </p>

<p>Many of the therapeutic agents cause anorexia as a side
effect, further suppressing an already poor appetite. </p>

<p>Ken had used cannabis 20 years but only occasionally in social
situations. Since then, he has come to rely on using it daily to
maintain his appetite while taking the various chemotherapeutic
drugs. Not one to run from a fight, he has been a &quot;guinea
pig&quot; in many therapeutic research trials that have had
varying success in beating back the cancer or the fungal
infections. </p>

<p>Despite the sensitivity of his lungs from the PCP infection
that caused him to be hospitalized three years ago for four days,
he prefers to smoke cannabis. </p>

<p>Two or three puffs of high grade Northern California
sinsemilla using a water pipe twice or three times a day is
sufficient to maintain his appetite and provide the antidote to
the unwanted effects of the antibiotic and other chemotherapeutic
agents. He has tried oral preparations including Marinol but
found that he had difficulty controlling the dose. He was
incapacitated by both cannabis baked in brownies or 10 milligram
Marinol capsules. Ken describes himself as being sensitive to
cannabis' effects as compared with other social users. For him,
the effects of the brownie and Marinol were the same. </p>

<p>Having had lengthy association with fellow cannabis users in
his twenty years of experience he acknowledged that it is an
individual thing; the impact of the drug on one's mental state
for some may be adverse. For him? Definitely salutary. </p>

<p>The appetite stimulation and antidepressant effects help Ken
maintain his rational, if laconic, intelligent, I'll take it as
it comes attitude in his continuing internal lethal war of immune
system versus virus with opportunistic infectious invaders ever
seeking to gain advantage. The KS may be seen as a viral invader
causing a specific disseminated cancers that will slowly advance
unless poisoned or radiated. </p>

<p>Despite different causes of infectious assault upon the immune
system be it the Human Immunodefficiency Virus or other viral,
parasitic, or bacterial agents, cannabis has a long history of
reputed efficacy in traditional medicine for increasing
resistance to endemic infectious diseases in India. </p>

<p>In its massive study performed a century ago the Indian Hemp
Drugs Commission took note: </p>

<p>&quot;There is a large body of evidence showing that hemp
drugs, both as smoked and as drunk, are used as a febrifuge or
preventive of diseases common in malarious tracts or arising from
bad water. Cannabis continues to be used in contemporary
Ayurvedic Medicine to treat malarial fever.&quot; </p>

<p>The IHDC in its review of medicinal uses of cannabis discussed
one possible mechanism as to utilizing it to ward off febrile
illnesses in areas in India reputed to have high danger of
infection. Cannabis was recommended to be used by manual laborers
to promote appetite, enhance endurance, and protect against
illness. Again, the raising of the spirits, or inspiriting
provide a psychic component that accompanies the physical effects
of the drug. </p>

<p>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission reviewed Other beneficial
effects: </p>

<p>&quot;The drugs are said to be cheering in their effects, and
to be prized by many on this account. An interesting illustration
of this may perhaps be found in the popular belief existing in
many parts that these drugs protect against cholera and other
epidemic diseases. One very intelligent witness, who had seen
much of this use, explains it to as due to the stimulating and
inspiriting<b>*</b> nature of the drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>Expectations and attributes in the language entwine with the
pharmacology of the drug in producing its therapeutic (or
adverse) effects. This affirmative &quot;popular belief&quot; may
be seen as a factor that favorably affects the physiology of the
user including the immune system in optimizing its resistance to
stress. Psychogenic factors play a significant role in the
mediation of the immune response. </p>

<p>Linguistically the Sanskrit and Hindi references are to the
attributes of healing, strength, and success: </p>

<p>Vijaya victorious </p>

<p>Trailokyavijaya victorious in three worlds </p>

<p>Indracana Indra's food </p>

<p>Jaya victorious </p>

<p>Virapattra leaf of heroes </p>

<p>Capala the light hearted </p>

<p>Ajaya the unconquered </p>

<p>Ananda the joyful </p>

<p>Harsini the rejoicer </p>

<p>vakpradatava speech giving </p>

<p>medhakaritva inspiring of mental power </p>

<p>creshadipanatva a most excellent excitant </p>

<p>These Indian cultural images from a century ago are in bright
contrast with the vulgarized and argot of code, intoxication and
incapacitation where the drug is illegal. </p>

<p>To a worshiper of Shiva, many of the contemporary terms for
cannabis applied to this holy sacrament would be perceived as
unintelligible blasphemy if not barbarous obscenity. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding today's prohibition language of deviance and
intoxication, individuals self-medicating for a variety of
conditions make independent discoveries that affirm attributes
described in the medicine of a different culture. This
independent discovery in a prohibitionist society seems to
support pharmacology over placebo effect. </p>

<p>Ken has always known his antidepressant and appetite stimulant
as marijuana, becoming acquainted with it in a social rather than
therapeutic context. He didn't get to know it as a traditional
medicine Vijaya or Capala but nevertheless obtains benefit from
cannabis. </p>

<p>Postscript: Ken died peacefully ten months later at home with
his wife Mary in attendance who had helped him during his long
fight. He began to significantly decline in his energy a month
after the interview. His legs became increasingly weak and
painful. Morphine was begun six weeks later. Ken managed a trip
to Florida but needed to to be in a wheelchair. </p>

<p>A month after our interview his anorexia was so severe that
Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) was begun. A permanent tube was
inserted into a large vein for injecting a mixture of nutrients. </p>

<p>Six months after the interview the PCP worsened his condition
with increasing weakness and fatigue. It was felt that the fungus
had breached the blood-brain barrier and invaded Ken's brain. </p>

<p>Mentally, Ken was free from dementia until six weeks before
his death with intermittantly but increasingly severe
disorientation and confusion. He would be clear for days at a
time before becoming totally disoriented and confused. He would
recognize that someone was familiar but misidentify as someone
else. </p>

<p>Three weeks before he died he stopped smoking cannabis which
continued to ease his nausea and anorexia. Ken became too
confused and disoriented to light his pipe. </p>

<h1>Safe Use of Cannabis </h1>

<p> <b>by Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D. </b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Cannabis, ingested safely, is one of the most useful of
medicines for a variety of conditions. These include: pain,
spasticity, anxiety, depression, headache, nausea, anorexia,
epilepsy, asthma, dysmenorrhea, premenstrual tension, withdrawal
from other drugs, and glaucoma. </p>

<p> Ignorantly or imprudently used, cannabis can be harmful. </p>

<h2>Physical effects. </h2>

<p> Irritation of the throat and lungs is one of the most obvious
adverse effects to the marijuana smoker as is the inevitable
cough upon inhaling. </p>

<p> The cough is the body's reaction to the irritation of the
numerous constituents of the smoke. Prolonged and repeated
exposure to these irritants can lower resistance to and aggravate
infections from viruses, bacteria, or fungi. </p>

<p> The lesser the coughing, the safer the smoke. The fewer puffs
the better. </p>

<p> For these reasons, and to reduce harm to the user; better a
water pipe of the more potent flower tops of cannabis than a
joint of leaves. </p>

<h2>Even better: Vaporization. </h2>

<p> Delta 1,9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), psychoactive ingredient
of cannabis, is a resin that vaporizes at 155 to 157 degrees
centigrade (311-318 degrees Fahrenheit) which is lower than the
combustion point of cellulose: Fahrenheit 451. Any way to
decrease exposure of the throat and lungs to products of burning
reduces harm to the cannabis user. </p>

<h2>Dosage and Route of Administration </h2>

<p> Starting with a small amount and gradually increasing the
dose is the key to avoiding unwanted mental side effects. This is
called titration- self-titration if adjusted by the user. </p>

<h2>Mental Effects </h2>

<p> Impatience and overdosing with oral cannabis is the most
frequent mention of the drug in medical literature of the 1800's.
Oral cannabis overdoseage is much more intense and longer lasting
than from the inhaled route. Because of the two to three hours
before onset of effects, a common mistake of the inexperienced is
to repeat the oral dose with the consequence of overdosing. </p>

<h2>Overdoseage </h2>

<p> Should you take too much cannabis you may expect the mental
effects of time distortion, racing thoughts, disorientation,
speeding heart rate, dry mouth, and reddened eyes. The greater
the dose, the greater intensity and longer these stimulant
effects will last before sinking into a deep sleep. No lasting
harm will result but the experience will not be forgotten. </p>

<h2>Other Adverse Effects </h2>

<p> Other adverse mental effects are a prolonged dullness after
use or paranoia and a fear of loss of control. Cannabis, an
effective relaxant, can cause an alienation or detachment. The
price of relief of tension may be a dulling or suppression of
feelings. Insensitivity to feelings of others or situations may
result. </p>

<h2>Set and Setting </h2>

<p> The result of the drug is a combination of set
(expectations), setting, personality, and the drug. </p>

<p> Best case: Enjoying a puff or two sitting at home with a
friend at the end of the day. </p>

<p> Worst case: Taking a puff driving down the freeway, then
looking sideways into the eyes of a cop. </p>

<h2>Personality and Individual Difference </h2>

<p> Individuals with personalities that are prone to substance
abuse, allergy, sensitivity, or adverse reactions to other
medicines should exert greater caution and try the drug only if
absolutely necessary. </p>

<h2>Dependence &amp; Withdrawal </h2>

<p> Because cannabis is such an effective medicine for the relief
of many uncomfortable conditions, using the drug on a continuing
basis is not uncommon. One must decide issues of personal
risks/benefits of continuing using cannabis. </p>

<p> Withdrawal from chronic cannabis use produces several nights
of more intense dreaming and possibly some slightly increased
nervousness during the day. Some increase in exercise, if
possible, and/or small amounts of other sedatives will ease the
transition from cannabis dependence. </p>

<h2>Cannabis- a Tool </h2>

<p> Cannabis is a tool like other drugs; useful for many people
if informed of its effects. with realistic expectations,
responsibility and common sense. There is a range of appropriate
use: from total avoidance to using cannabis several times a day. </p>

<p> Because of current uncertainty of supply from it's illicit
status there can be great variability in strength. </p>

<p> <center><b>Oral vs Inhalation</b></center> </p>

<p> <center><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </center>
</p>

<p> Cannabis may be ingested orally or inhaled. Users of cannabis
usually inhale. Inhalation may be smoked or vaporized.Marinol's
fixed dose increment form is, for some patients, suboptimal for
induction </p>

<p> Gradual upward adjustment from a minimal initial dose over a
period of days was the standard of practice with cannabis extract
prior to removal in 1940 from prescriptive availability. </p>

<p> Anecdotal reports of users of both Marinol and cannabis
describe enhancement or constructive supplementation. Others who
have tried both have described cannabis as superior to Marinol.
The inhalation route is significantly more consistently
effective. </p>

<p> <b>Marinol </b>(dronabinol) synthetic delta -9
tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame oil. Supplied in fixed
doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 milligram soft gelatin capsules. Taken
orally. </p>

<p> <b>Cannabis</b> extract: </p>

<p> 9 known delta -9 Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p> 2 known delta -8 Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p> 50 other cannabinoids that may interact with or modify
reactions with the Tetrahydrocannabinols, the primary active
principles. </p>

<p> ( <i>Source: Marijuana and Health Institute of Medicine,
National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1982, P13-15)</i> </p>

<p> Oral ingestion of either cannabis or Marinol is characterized
by: </p>

<p> delayed onset of effects </p>

<p> variable level of effects </p>

<p> prolonged effects </p>

<p> Inhalation is characterized by: </p>

<p> quick onset of effects </p>

<p> consistent level of effects </p>

<p> shorter lasting effects. </p>

<p> <center><b>Inhalation: Vaporization vs Smoke</b> </center> </p>

<p> Significant irritants and toxic products of combustion
accompany smoking and can be minimized by vaporizing the
cannabinoids contained within the plant materials.
Tetrahydrocannabinols vaporize at 400 Fahrenheit while cellulose
combusts at 451 F. Two crude vaporizer prototypes have been
successfully demonstrated: a modified manually operated auto
cigarette lighter element, and a heat gun for electronic shrink
tubing set at 400 F. Unfortunately, vaporizers are currently
defined by law as illegal paraphernalia, a citable offense. </p>

<p> <b>Inhalation: Smoking: Harm Reduction Considerations</b> </p>

<p> Contrary to anti-marijuana statements that more potent or
stronger material is more dangerous, the opposite is true.
Admittedly cannabis smoke is irritating to the throat and lungs.
The less exposure the better. The more potent, the less exposure
is needed for effect. The potency before prohibition of medicinal
cannabis was greater than any illicit cannabis available- so far.
</p>

<p> For those using the drug infrequently or are sensitive to
cannabis, the lower potency of inexpensive illicit canabis may be
suitable. </p>

<p> The cooler, cleaner, and further the better. </p>

<p> A bong or water pipe is the best, a long pipe better than a
short pipe, a long joint better than a roach. </p>

<p> Not sharing a smoke is safer than passing it around and
possibly contracting infections diseases. </p>

<p> Never had it before? Use it with a friend who has. Find a
safe, quiet, and private place. Relax, and let the drug take its
effect. </p>

<p> Never use cannabis before or during driving or other
activities that need your full attention. </p>

<p> <center><b>Clinical Research Needed</b> </center> </p>

<p> Only <i>clinical</i> research comparing Marinol to other
Tetrahydrocannabinols and cannabinoids for therapeutic efficacy
can clarify this controversy. </p>

<p> Tentative and preliminary clinical findings indicate a
significant difference between Marinol and natural crude cannabis
preparations in favor of the crude product. Route of
administration and fixed incremental dosage may be factors in
comparative efficacy and unwanted effects. </p>

<h1>Medicinal Uses of Hemp Drugs </h1>

<p><b>Tod Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Introduced into western medicine in 1839 by William
O'Shaughnessey, M.D., hemp drugs attained wide uses. Sedative,
analgesic, and antispasmodic therapeutic qualities of this unique
substances combine efficacy and low toxicity. </p>

<p>Despite contemporary scientific protestations as to the lack
of substantive knowledge, a background of substantive clinical
and scientific data remains largely forgotten. </p>

<p>Because current drug laws preclude general clinical use,
review of medicinal, pharmaceutical, and social pre-prohibition
is requisite to understanding its medicinal utility. Bereft of
actual clinical experience with the drug its understanding has
become largely retrograde and atrophic. </p>

<p>Reefer madness signals were substituted for pharmacy. Cannabis
became marihuana. The Drug Enforcement Agency has continued the
official fictions, a side effect of national marijuana
prohibition of 1937. </p>

<p>Despite official denial and statements to the contrary,
significant evidence exists that hemp drugs are effective as: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Relaxant/sedative </li>
    <li>Antidepressant </li>
    <li>Analgesic/antispasmodic </li>
    <li>Child birth aid </li>
    <li>Intraocular hypotensive </li>
    <li>Appetite stimulant </li>
    <li>Hypothermogenic </li>
    <li>Alcohol substitute </li>
    <li>Withdrawal agent for sedative dependence </li>
    <li>Topical antibiotic </li>
</ul>

<p>Clinical efficacy before its' removal from availability as
reported in the literature is variable as with most medications
used in many conditions. One of the most frequently mentioned in
medical texts of the 1900's was migraine headache. </p>

<p>The effects of hemp drugs on the individual and society has
been one of the most extensively studied drugs in history. </p>

<ul>
    <li>1893-5 Indian Hemp Drugs Commission </li>
    <li>1931 Panama Canal Military Study </li>
    <li>1938-44 Mayors' Committee on Marihuana (New York) </li>
    <li>1973 National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse </li>
    <li>1980 National Academy of Science Study </li>
    <li>1990 California Research Advisory Panel </li>
</ul>

<p>The effects of politics upon the findings of commission
studies in the U.S. by presidents, prosecutors, and government
attorneys has been devastating. All of the findings and the
studies themselves have been rejected, ignored, or suppressed. </p>

<p>The latest disgraces in a public policy based upon resultant
debased information have been wrought by the recent federal
policies of withholding hemp drugs from AIDS victims. </p>

<p>The RESTORATION OF HEMP MEDICAL PREPARATIONS TO LIST OF
AVAILABLE MEDICINES IN CALIFORNIA; DECLARATION OF POLICY
initiative seeks to correct this bad and harmful policy. </p>

<p> DRAFT </p>

<p> Sedative Effects </p>

<p> Continued Use exhibits a much more controlled pattern of mood
management through a mild stimulation with low repeated inhaled
doses. Modulation of emotional reactivity appears to be another
significant desired effect of cannabis. The net effects for the
continuing moderate user are a unique combination of mood
elevation with a decrease in anxiety that is easily controlled. </p>

<p> Antidepressant </p>

<p> The ancient Greek, Indian, Persian, writings are replete with
descriptions of antidepressant properties: </p>

<p> Homer's Odyssey describes Helen using a potion obtained from
Polydamna that lifted the spirits at a morose gathering by
slipping Nepenthe in the wine. Nepenthe means &quot;against
sorrow&quot; . </p>

<p> Samscrit and Hindi writings characterize cannabis: </p>

<p> Before the 8th century an anti phlegmatic, Circa 1050:
victorious (Vijaya), and victorious in three worlds
(Trailokyavijaya). </p>

<p> 1300 A.D. in The Rajanighantu of Narahari Pandita: the light
hearted (Capala), the joyful (Ananda), the rejoicer (Harsini),
speech giving (vakpradatva) inspiring of mental power
(medhakaritva), and a most excellent excitant (cresthadipanatva).
</p>

<p> 17th Century Materia Medica The Rajavallabha: &quot;It
creates vital energy, the mental powers, and internal heat,
corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic humour, and is an
elixir vitae.&quot; </p>

<p> In contemporary terms a case of severe and chronic depression
may have been successfully treated through self medication with
cannabis. </p>

<p> The Persian physician Mirza Abdool Rhazes wrote:&quot;The
oldest work in which Hemp is noticed is a treatise by Hasan, who
states that in the year 658 (Mahometan era)(1258), the Sheikh
Djafar Shirazi, a monk of the order of Haider, learnt from his
master the history of the discovery of Hemp. Haider, the chief of
ascetics and self-chasteners, lived in rigid privation on a
mountain between Nishabor and Romah, where he established a
monastery of Fakirs. Ten years he had spent in his retreat,
without leaving it for a moment, till one burning summer's day,
when he departed alone to the fields. On his return an air of joy
and gaiety was imprinted on his countenance; he received the
visits of his brethren, and encouraged their conversation. On
being questioned, he stated that: struck by the aspect of a plant
which danced in the heat as if with joy, while all the rest of
the vegetable creation was torpid, he had gathered and eaten of
it's leaves. He led his companions to the spot, all ate, and all
were similarly excited. A tincture of the Hemp leaf in wine or
spirit seems to have been the favorite formula in which the
Sheikh Haider indulged himself. An Arab poet sings of Haider's
emerald cup; an evident allusion to the rich green colour of the
tincture of the drug. The Sheikh survived the discovery ten
years, subsisting chiefly on this herb, and on his death his
disciples by his desire planted it in an arbour about his tomb.
From this saintly sepulcher the knowledge of the effects of Hemp
is stated to have spread into Khorasan.&quot; </p>

<p> In 1845 J.J. Moreau de Tours, a French psychiatrist utilized
cannabis in the treatment of depression described the drug's
effects: </p>

<p> &quot;It seems that nothing can hurt you in this peace of
mind, that you are inaccessible to sadness. I doubt that the most
unfortunate news could draw you out of that imaginary bliss,
which can only be appreciated through experience. </p>

<p> I have just attempted to give an idea of the delights that
hashish produces. I hasten to add that I have presented them here
in no more than raw form, as it were, and at their simplest. It
will depend upon external circumstances to confer upon these
feelings of happiness still greater intensity by directing them
toward a determined goal and by concentrating them on a single
point. One imagines what reality can add to this state of bliss
and how much the joys of hashish can be enhanced by external
impressions, by direct sensory excitations, or by the stirring of
passions through natural causes. At that time, the rapture of
hashish intoxication, taking shape and form, will assume the
dimensions of delirium. This disposition of the mind, linked with
another which I will discuss later, was, I feel, the fertile
source from which the fanatic inhabitants of Lebanon derived that
happiness, those ineffable delights for which they gladly
sacrificed their lives. </p>

<p> It is necessary here to clarify what I have just said. It is
really happiness that hashish gives, and by that I mean mental
joy, not sensual joy as one might be tempted to believe. This is
indeed very curious, and one can draw strange conclusions- this
one among others, that all joy, all contentment, even though its
cause is strictly mental, deeply spiritual, and highly
idealistic, could well be in reality a purely physical sensation,
developed physiologically, exactly like those caused by hashish.
At least, if one relies on inner feelings, there is no
distinction to be made between these two orders of sensations, in
spite of the diversity of the causes to which they are related
for the hashish user is happy, not in the manner of the glutton,
of the ravenous man who satisfies his appetite, or even of the
hedonist who gratifies his desires, but in the manner, for
example, of the man who hears news that compounds his joys, of
the miser counting his treasures, of the gambler whom luck
favors, or the ambitious man whom success intoxicates. </p>

<p> However, the preceding remarks were not intended to raise a
psychological question. I am merely recording observations, and
have no other pretension than that of being the faithful and
exact historian of my sensations.&quot; This characterization of
the antidepressant effects of the drug in contemporary contexts
would be unthinkable pro drug sedition and would never be found
in any advertisement. </p>

<p> Depression as one of the conditions listed for treatment
appeared in general Materia Medica, or medical texts , , , </p>

<p> Subsequent clinical use in depression is described as having
variable results. Clouston in 1871 from the Cumberland and
Westmoreland asylum reported on five cases of melancholy with
some success in four and marked improvement in one. Villard
describes similar variable results in melancholia by physicians
in France. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1894 reviewed
medical literature, testimony by both indigenous medical
practitioners and Western trained physicians and described
cannabis to be used as a tonic to increase stamina, </p>

<p> Cannabis decreases emotional reactivity and intensity of
affect while increasing introspection as evidenced by the slowing
of the EEG after initial stimulation. The unique sedative effects
of cannabis then begin to prevail. Obsessive and pressured
thinking give way to introspective free associations when in
relaxed circumstances. Emotional reactivity is smoothed out,
worries are less pressing. The alteration of time perception
relieves the &quot;hurry sickness&quot;. </p>

<p> Analgesic Effects </p>

<p> Two thousand years ago Chinese used cannabis in high doses to
induce a state of altered consciousness to permit major surgery.
The analgesic effects of cannabis, which are less potent than the
opiates, appear in part to be from decreased affective
reactivity, which is modulated by altered time perception. </p>

<p> &quot;During the time that this remarkable drug is relieving
pain a very curious psychical condition sometimes manifests
itself; namely, that the diminution of pain seems to be due to
its fading into the distance, so that the pain in a delicate ear
would grow less and less as a beaten drum was carried farther and
farther out of the range of hearing. </p>

<p> This condition is probably associated with the other well
known symptom produced by the drug, namely, the prolongation of
time.&quot; Cannabis was mentioned in most general medical texts
as an analgesic but with lesser potency than the opiates. </p>

<p> Different types of pain respond differently to cannabis.
Review of clinical literature discloses two general categories
that respond affirmatively: Intermittent spasmodic pain and
inflammation. (See table 1) </p>

<p> Migraine Headache is a specific type of pain for which
cannabis was first described to be useful by J. Russell Reynolds
. After some thirty years clinical experience after this initial
observation, he described &quot;Migraine: very many victims have
for years kept their sufferings in abeyance by taking hemp at the
moment of threatening, or onset of the attack.&quot; In Osler's
medical text it was the treatment of choice for migraine
headache. The most recent (and last) mention of cannabis for the
treatment of migraine was from Morris Fishbein, M.D., Editor of
the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1942. </p>

<p> Cannabis was compared with alcohol in cross-cultural
comparisons in India. Daru vs Bhang. G. Morris Carstairs
described differences in emotional reactivity: contrast of
cannabis comparable effects of alcohol intoxication that
increases emotional reactivity. Cannabis cools the passions.
Alcohol inflames them. I have never heard of a pot room brawl. </p>

<p> Physical Effects: </p>

<p> Reddened Eyes: Increased Blood Circulation to the Brain </p>

<p> Moreau in his description of the clinical pharmacological
effects on the brain were to increase blood circulation during
effects of the drug. </p>

<p> The phenomenon of dilated eye blood vessels with cannabis
intoxication has been described extensively in writings on the
drug. The meninges, the membrane covering the brain, covers the
external eye. (except for the corneal area) The reddened eyes
represent a general increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). This
increase in blood circulation is due to decreased peripheral
resistance from dilation of the capillaries in the cerebral
cortex. CBF changes reflect mental effects; increased CBF:
stimulation of cognition, decreasing CBF: sedation. Chronic heavy
users appear to have decreased CBF when deprived of the drug. </p>

<p> Circulation and Heart Rate </p>

<p> Increased heart rate is due to central nervous system
modulation of the tenth cranial nerve (the vagus nerve). There
are no direct effects on the heart's electrical conduction system
nor general peripheral vasodilation. Heart rate increase is dose
related but not greater than moderate exercise. </p>

<p> Orthostatic hypotension which takes place with some cannabis
users is due to a transient lag in changes in the muscle tension
in artery walls when standing up after sitting or lying down. It
is a feeling of faintness or dizziness that is relieved by
sitting or reclining. This phenomenon is due to effects of
interfering with the reflex response readjusting the muscle
tension in arterial walls. Again, mediated through the vagus
nerve. </p>

<p> Glaucoma </p>

<p> Hepler and Frank in 1971 serindipitously discovered that
Marijuana smoking significantly lowered pressure in the eyeball
in 9 of 11 normal subjects. Frederick Blanton, M.D. , A Florida
ophthalmologist in private practice read about Hepler and Frank's
findings and tried cannabis in the form of marijuana spiked
brownies and marijuana cigarettes in 100 administrations with
positive results as compared to pilocarpine. In his series of 20
glaucoma patients their intraocular pressure was dropped from an
average of 25 to 18 mm Hg*. (Which is from the moderately
elevated to a normal value) Rather than being greeted by his
colleagues and the medical profession he was censured by his
county medical society and suspended for 6 months. The Hepler and
Frank team in a legal controlled study at U.C.L.A. confirmed Dr
Blanton's findings. </p>

<p> Robert Randall, a sufferer of glaucoma, after his arrest for
cultivation for personal use, successfully sued the federal
government on the basis of medical necessity and is currently
maintained on cannabis supplied by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse. He continues to hold his symptoms at bay through smoking
marijuana but if he attempts to stop experiences characteristic
symptoms of &quot;halo&quot; effects around lights and eye pain.
These symptoms cease when he starts inhaling marijuana smoke
again. </p>

<p> Asthma </p>

<p> The contradictory properties of irritation to the throat and
lungs causing bronchitis and the antiasthmatic effects
acknowledged by the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission: </p>

<p> &quot;In asthma and bronchitis inhalation of ganja smoke
appears to be very frequently prescribed; while on the other
hand, there is evidence which tends to indicate that both
affections may be induced by charas or ganja smoking indulged in
as a habit.&quot; </p>

<p> In Western medicine where the smoked route was rarely
employed cannabis was described as effective in controlling
asthma and cough. Since cannabis Prohibition the same seemingly
paradoxical properties have been confirmed. </p>

<p> Topical Effects </p>

<p> Cannabis resin, with the consistency of pine pitch, insoluble
in water is irritating to tissues although it has some topical
anesthetic properties. The crude plant also has bactericidal
properties. </p>

<p> Tracheobronchial Tree and Lungs </p>

<p> Because the most common route of administration is the smoked
route irritation to these organs is a safety concern. The
additional products from burning are undeniably irritating.
Animal experiments indicate that cannabis is different from
tobacco in its irritating effects on the lungs. The frequently
heard coughing fits of the cannabis smoker give irrefutable
involuntary vocal testimony to this undesirable side effect from
smoking cannabis. </p>

<p> Topical Applications </p>

<p> Aside from contact dermatitis in hemp harvesters and
processors at high levels of exposure, some allergenic
individuals react similarly to exposure to small amounts of
cannabis. </p>

<p> The powdered crude plant is moistened and applied to
arthritic joints. </p>

<p> Concentrated cannabis resin is topical anesthetic. Applied
directly to a nerve, the electrical impulses are inhibited. It
was mentioned as used on dental caries for treatment of pain. </p>

<p> Prior to removal from the market it was combined with
salicylic acid, a proteolytic agent, and collodion to keep it in
place for callus removal on feet. </p>

<p> [insert Corn Remedy Advertisement] </p>

<p> Although cannabis is water insoluble powdered cannabis has
been moistened and applied as a poultice to arthritic joints. </p>

<p> Cannabis powder has also been used as a topical antiseptic
applied to wounds to promote healing and prevent infection. </p>

<p> The antibiotic properties of cannabis appears to be in the
cannabidiolic acid and cannabidiol </p>

<p> Increased Appetite </p>

<p> Cannabis has been recognized as an appetite stimulant for
hundreds of years in non-western medicine. Mirza Abdool Rhazes,
&quot;a most intelligent Persian physician...considers Hemp to be
a powerful exciter of the flow of bile, and relates cases of its
efficacy in restoring appetite..&quot; &quot; &quot;produces a
healthy appetite,..digestive, easy of digestion,..and the
digestive faculty&quot; . </p>

<p> During its' century long prescriptive availability before
being taken off the market, stimulation of appetite was
frequently described, as a secondary effect during its use as an
analgesic or sedative in comparison with the opiates. McConnell
in 1888 specifically described success in treating anorexia
&quot;One of the conditions in which the drug has proved useful
in his hands is anorexia- loss of appetite consequent upon
exhausting diseases such as prolonged fevers, diarrhoea,
dysentery, phthisis, etc.&quot; </p>

<p> Appetite Stimulant </p>

<p> Antidiarrheal </p>

<p> Laxative </p>

<p> Lees described the drug as a mild stimulant to overcome
constipation and gastritis that is nervous in origin </p>

<p> Antiemetic </p>

<p> Anticonvulsant </p>

<p> With the introduction of cannabis to Western medicine in 1838

in 4 of his 18 patients in 1843. Acute rheumatism was
successfully treated by Buckingham in 1858 </p>

<p> Nail Patellar Tooth </p>

<p> Charcot Marie Tooth </p>

<p> Drusen of Optic Nerve </p>

<p> Cough Suppressant </p>

<p> Clendinning in 1843 described 18 cases of whom 6 presented
with cough- both acute and chronic that responded favorably to
cannabis. In addition to mention in most Materia Medica and
general medical literature as an antitussive, cannabis was
included in proprietary cough medicine like Piso's cough cure
that were available until 1937. </p>

<p> Antiasthmatic effects are described with both oral and smoked
routes of administration although the bronchitis from chronic use
was recognized as an undesirable side effect. </p>

<p> It was recognized to be useful &quot;in some cases of
Spasmodic Asthma&quot; </p>

<p> Antipruritic </p>

<p> Chronic and acute itching appear to respond well to cannabis
and is mentioned in several general medical texts. Grinspoon and
Baklar in Marijuana Forbidden Medicine reports a case of
self-medication with marijuana for intractable itching. </p>

<p> Alcohol, Opioid, and Sedative Substitute </p>

<p> Harm reduction through substitution </p>

<p> Clendinning also must be credited with substituting cannabis
for opium dependence in 4 of the 18 cases reported. Mattison in
1891 described cannabis as treatment of choice for the treatment
of opiate and alcohol dependence and cautioned the practitioner
to think twice before resorting to prolonged opiate use for pain:
&quot;Would that the wisdom which has come to their professional
fathers through, it maybe, a hapless experience, might serve them
to steer clear of narcotic shoals on which many a patient has
gone awreck. </p>

<p> Indian hemp is not here lauded as a specific. It will at
times, fail. So do other drugs. But the many cases in which it
acts well, entitle it to a large and lasting confidence.&quot; </p>

<p> Withdrawal and Substitute For Alcohol, Opioids, Sedatives,
and Nicotine </p>

<p> Three of Clendinning's cases were withdrawal from alcohol
dependence . Birch in 1889 and Mattison described cannabis as
useful in withdrawal from and substitute for chronic chloral and
chronic opium dependence. Reed described cannabis for the
treatment of nicotinism </p>

<p> Febrifuge </p>

<p> The mention in the 17th century Persian medical text
Makhzan-el-Adwiya as &quot;imparting a gentle heat, and then a
considerable refrigerant effect.&quot; The Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission took note: There is a large body of evidence showing
that hemp drugs, both as smoked and as drunk, are used as a
febrifuge or preventive of diseases common in malarious tracts or
arising from bad water.&quot; Cannabis continues to be used in
contemporary Ayurvedic Medicine to treat malarial fever. </p>

<p> Clendinning in 1843 described effectiveness in the treatment
of four cases of febrile illness. </p>

<p> While this property of cannabis went largely unnoticed by
Western medicine, it was rediscovered in the classified Army
research done from 1954 - 1959 reported by Van M. Sim, M.D.,
chief of the Edgewood Arsenal research program in an interview:
&quot;The tetrahydrocannabinols also are capable of lowering the
body temperature three to four degrees centigrade under
conditions of severe hyperpyrexia.&quot; While Dr Sim is credited
with getting the findings declassified, at this writing there has
been no clinical follow-up. </p>

<p> Sedative </p>

<p> The sedative and sleep inducing properties of cannabis were
described in both general and medical literature as the end phase
after an initial stimulation. </p>

<p> Edes while unsuccessfully treating headache relieved a
patient of nightmares. As late as 1937 it was officially
described by the American Medical Association as being
&quot;...the average physician will readily admit that Indian
hemp is employed in various preparations for internal use as a
sedative and antispasmodic&quot; Hindu and Persian writings give
many different accounts of the biphasic effects of the drug. The
legendary nepenthe in Greek mythology may have been cannabis. </p>

<p> Uterine stimulant and contracting agent </p>

<p> Hashish was discovered in an ancient tomb in Israel; a woman
who ha apparently died in chilbirth . Used in Africa by the
smoked route. Studied by Christison , Willis , Dey, Stille&quot;
, Grigor , and Batho all reported help with uterine dysfunction
as well as stimulation of labor. Treatment of dysmenorrhea and
premenstrual syndrome (PMS) . </p>

<p> Aphrodisiac and sexual aid </p>

<p> While controversial, the alleged aphrodisiac properties are
mentioned frequently in the Indian literature, there have never
been any definitive studies. A book was devoted to the sexual
power of marijuana. Sex and drugs continue to have continuing and
complex relationships. </p>

<p> Psychological Research Tool </p>

<p> With the development of the philosophy and psychology of the
individual with scientific methodology in the mid 19th century,
the study of effects of cannabis on the mind were diverse.
O'Shaughnessy's opening of a medical transcultural portal with
his 1838 monograph, On the Preparations of the Indian Hemp, or
Gunja (Cannabis Indica) Their Effects on the Animal Systems in
Health, and Their Utility in the Treatment of Tetanus and Other
Convulsive Diseases a timeless paradigm of modern scientific
method. Review of the literature, social observation, animal
studies, healthy human studies, and effects with diseases.
Psychotropic effects of cannabis were a salient aspect of this
drug which was new to western medicine. This basic primary
knowledge disseminated throughout medical and lay literature saw
a diverse application of cannabis' effects on the mind. </p>

<p> John Stuart Mill suggested using cannabis for the recall of
forgotten memories. </p>

<p> Moreau de Tours described study of the effects to mimic
mental illness, self administration to experientially understand
pathologic mental states of dementia, mania, and delusional
conditions suffered by patients. He also recommended personally
experiencing the effects of therapeutic drugs in order to be a
more empathetic and effective clinician. Self-study through the
effects of cannabis was not only acceptable but necessary for a
proper understanding of the drug. </p>

<p> Bell proposed its use in the treatment of mania, dementia,
and melancholia and cited Moreau's model of simulation of
different forms of mental disorder. </p>

<p> Kubie and Margolin described cannabis as useful in recovering
repressed memories during dissociative mental states caused by
the drug. Rolls and Stafford-Clark described success with the use
of a single session cannabis experience in the treatment of a
case of depersonalization where pentobarbital and methamphetamine
narcosynthesis had failed. </p>

<p> These properties of cannabis and the disruption of cognition
at higher dose were evaluated as chemical weapons by the secret
government research from 1947 through 1977 . It was an original
candidate as an aid in interrogation designated the &quot;Truth
Drug&quot; TD </p>

<p> Therapeutic Power of Cannabis: A General Theory </p>

<p> Effects of any drug are more than the pharmacology. The
effects include the set (or expectations), setting, physical and
psychological makeup of the user. The set and setting includes
the culture which is expressed in its language. Semantics and
pharmacology define the drug. </p>

<p> The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission reviewed Other beneficial
effects: </p>

<p> &quot;The drugs are said to be cheering in their effects, and
to be prized by many on this account. An interesting illustration
of this may perhaps be found in the popular belief existing in
many parts that these drugs protect against cholera and other
epidemic diseases. One very intelligent witness, who had seen
much of this use, explains it to as due to the stimulating and
inspiriting* nature of the drugs.&quot; </p>

<p> This semantic attitudinal component is synergistic with the
pharmacology of the drug in producing its therapeutic effects.
This affirmative &quot;popular belief&quot; may be seen as a
factor that favorably affects the physiology of the user
including the immune system in optimizing its resistance to
stress. Psychogenic factors play a significant role in the
mediation of the immune response. </p>

<p> Linguistically the Sanskrit and Hindi references are to the
attributes of healing, strength, and success: </p>

<p> Vijaya victorious </p>

<p> Trailokyavijaya victorious in three worlds </p>

<p> Indracana Indra's food </p>

<p> Jaya victorious </p>

<p> Virapattra leaf of heroes </p>

<p> Capala the light hearted </p>

<p> Ajaya the unconquered </p>

<p> Ananda the joyful </p>

<p> Harsini the rejoicer </p>

<p> vakpradatava speech giving </p>

<p> medhakaritva inspiring of mental power </p>

<p> creshadipanatva a most excellent excitant </p>

<p> With these product images of cannabis the set and
expectations are not of forbidden deviance or illicit sensual
pleasure implicit in the contemporary argot- marijuana. </p>

<p> The fact that medical marijuana was &quot;discovered&quot;
despite the heavy prohibitionist censorship and pejorative
semantics in descriptions of characteristics of the drug attests
to the significant and strong pharmacological component of the
therapeutic effects of cannabis. </p>

<p> I am left with the question as to the relationship between
social, psychological, and physical elements; the sequence, and
eventual accomodation. At this writing the salient problem is a
generalized ignorance within the medical and scientific
communities resulting from unavailability for clinical use- a
serious case of disuse atrophy. The vaccuum of clinical
experience with cannabis has been filled by poisonous fiction.
Medline, the computer data base of medical and scientific
abstracts and listings memorializes (if memorialize can be said
of volatile and evanescent data bases) the absence of therapeutic
applications. This temporocentric window of a decade or less on
the topic of cannabis is a poisonous memory hole. Drug policy
based upon this structurally mandated ignorance is harmful and
stupid. A social form of dementia. This ignorance is then
defended by the policy makers as they make wrongheaded and
harmful decisions that perpetuate these policies. These are
collective delusional behaviors. The courts, prosecutors, and
police play an excessively active role in facilitating and
perpetuating- if not actively perpetrating this social illness.
On the tricentennial of the Salem Witch Trials Satan is alive and
well; fed on the demonology of Prohibition. William Bennett,
first recent Drug Czar designate of the United States, proclaimed
Satan as etiology of drug woes. </p>

<p> Marijuana, Hashish, Cannabis, or Hemp?: What's in a Name? </p>

<p> Only with reluctance I have chosen to utilize the term
marijuana over cannabis or hemp drugs because of its contemporary
meanings. Etymologically, one sees this distinction in the 1839
paper by O'Shaughessey </p>

<p> &quot;The term &quot;marihuana&quot; is a mongrel word that
has crept into this country over the Mexican border and has no
general meaning, except as it relates to Cannabis preparations
for smoking. It is not recognized in medicine...&quot; testified
William C. Woodward, M.D., lobbyist for the American Medical
Association before congress at hearings for the 1937 Marihuana
Tax act that ended the medicinal use of cannabis after a
century's availability. </p>

<p> But one finds this in medical and scientific literature not
listed under marijuana- but under cannabis or hemp drugs. </p>

<p> Notwithstanding the availability of one of the active
principles, delta 1, 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol)
dissolved in sesame oil, (Marinol) since 1986 as a schedule II
drug with approved applications as an antiemetic for side effects
of cancer chemotherapy and since 1993 for AIDS wasting syndrome.
The numerous other medicinal uses of cannabis- or hemp drugs
remain largely undocumented and unreported (including use of
Marinol for applications not authorized under federal law but
permitted under California law) The chilling effect of policies
of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and its precursors
since the removal of cannabis from the U.S. Pharmacopeia and
National Formulary in 1940 continues to maintain the fiction that
cannabis drugs have no medicinal uses. </p>

<p> Unfortunately this harmful fiction has devastating
consequences for the many patients with serious painful
debilitating and lethal conditions. The poisonous immoral,
illicit and illegal image of marijuana has caused numerous
sufferers to reject efficacious treatment with cannabinoids. </p>

<p> When in consultations with elderly patients in proffering
Marinol to patients for anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, an
occasional victim rejects the &quot;pot&quot; pill &quot;because
it is wrong&quot;, I curse the deluded ignorance of our
contemporary medical and scientific realities distorted by
putting prosecutors and police in charge of medical decisions.
Sick? Call a cop. </p>

<p> The Future of Marijuana lies in the Past </p>

<p> Our contemporary font of knowledge of the therapeutic uses of
cannabis is poisoned by official moralistic lies and censorship.
Besides the immediate toxicity of inappropriate withholding of
the drug, the resulting loss of credibility of these statements
by those with personal experience diminishes trust and belief in
the sources. Thus the clinical research reported by medicine
before marijuana prohibition in 1937 becomes even more important.
</p>

<p> Contemporary perseverative voices claiming &quot;We don't
know enough to proceed further!&quot; merely articulate their
ignorance of the existing clinical literature. </p>

<p> Just below the layer of fouled and distorted information of
the present lies a convincing body of objective clinical
information on therapeutic attributes of the drug. </p>

<p> Cannabis in Western Medicine </p>

<p> Introduced to Western medicine by Sir William B.
O'Shaughnessey, M.D. in 1839 , he acknowledged both medical and
non-medical uses and confirmed previous observations cited in
earlier literature: &quot;...the kind of mental excitement it
produces depends on the temperament of the consumer.&quot; an
observation described in 1695 in Rumphius Herbarium Amboinense .
O'Shaughnessy, not confining himself to the minimal information
in contemporary Western medical literature, turned to Ayurvedic,
Persian, and Arabic systems for additional descriptions: </p>

<p> The pre-synthetic era pharmaceutical industry confronted
problems with wide variations in potency of different
preparations of cannabis. The descriptions of inadvertent
overdose with the drug are the most numerous in medical
literature of the 19th century. </p>

<p> A clinical protocol whose applicability transcends time and
technologic innovation is that of Sir J. Russell Reynolds, M.D.,
F.R.S. in 1890: </p>

<p> &quot;The dose should be given in minimum quantity, repeated
in not less than four or six hours, and gradually increased by
one drop every third or fourth day, until either relief is
obtained, or the drug is proved, in such case, to be
useless.&quot; </p>

<p> This patient, prudent, and cautious regimen by this physician
to Queen Victoria's court summarized his thirty years of clinical
experience with the drug. The Reynolds Protocol should be used
whenever possible. </p>

<p> Patience is of prime importance since it compensates for
idiosyncratic sensitivity, lengthy onset time when taken orally,
and variability in potency of the preparation. </p>

<p> In the 1800's, Transportation, storage, handling, shipping,
and processing problems caused significant variation in potency
from one sample to another. Today, the illicit market for
cannabis produces similar variability. </p>

<p> Unlike a century ago, a salient issue is the availability of
the crude drug in quantities adequate for continued personal
therapeutic trial. </p>

<p> A Legal Cannabinoid: Marinol </p>

<p> Marinol* Roxane Laboratories, Inc. , a synthetic single
tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame oil (dronabinol) in
doses of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 milligram soft gelatin capsules may
be quite useful in some cases. A schedule II drug requiring a
triplicate prescription, it is restricted for use in nausea and
vomiting for side effects in cancer chemotherapy, and (since
12/93) AIDS wasting syndrome. </p>

<p> In my clinical experience with Marinol it has been useful not
only in these indicated conditions and also in the treatment of
depression, insomnia, agitation, muscle spasm, migraine headache
and pain. </p>

<p> For others, Marinol is either ineffectual or produces
undesirable side effects. With some who experience side effects
it is due to improper administration. </p>

<p> Route of Administration: Inhalation vs Oral. </p>

<p> If at all possible, the oral route is preferable since the
throat and lungs are not irritated by the drug. The clinical
medical literature and pharmaceutical catalogs prior to the
removal of cannabis in 1937 indicates the oral route was the
medicinal standard. While crude powdered cannabis was available
through pharmacies that could be smoked, it was apparently
minimal compared with the use of tinctures (alcoholic solutions
of cannabis) and extracts (cannabis resin). In addition, cannabis
was added to sedative mixtures that would contain combinations of
other plant extracts and bromine salts. </p>

<p> Advantages of the oral route </p>

<p> * No irritation to throat and lungs </p>

<p> * Stable levels of the drug </p>

<p> * Lengthy period of action </p>

<p> Disadvantages of the oral route </p>

<p> * Difficult to estimate dosage with single doses </p>

<p> * Once eaten, the dose cannot be adjusted </p>

<p> * Slow onset of effects </p>

<p> * Dependent on activity and content of stomach and small
intestines </p>

<p> * Lengthy period of action </p>

<p> * Slow wearing off of effects </p>

<p> * Inefficient use of the drug </p>

<p> With an empty stomach in a relaxed situation, effects may
start in a an hour or so. The length of action is related to the
dosage or sensitivity. With a small dose some three or four
hours, with a large dose twelve or more hours. </p>

<p> The intensity of mental effects is directly dose related. </p>

<p> Inhalation: Smoking </p>

<p> Smoking, while traditionally associated with social or
recreational use, may be desirable for certain users but
unsuitable for others. </p>

<p> The advantages to inhalation are: </p>

<p> * Rapid onset of effects- a minute or less </p>

<p> * Accurate adjustment of dose </p>

<p> * Fast disappearance of effects </p>

<p> * Efficient use of drug </p>

<p> * Not effected by contents of stomach or intestines </p>

<p> * Not impeded by liver </p>

<p> * Difficult- if not impossible to overdose </p>

<p> Smoking: Minimizing Harm </p>

<p> Pharmacologically, as with most things there is no free
lunch; smoked crude cannabis is undeniably irritating to the
throat and lungs. If the user opts for the smoked use of cannabis
reducing harm is possible. </p>

<p> The stronger, cooler and cleaner the better. </p>

<p> The more potent the cannabis, the less the throat and lungs
are exposed to irritating impurities as fewer puffs are needed
for the desired effects. The further away from the mouth and
throat, the cooler the smoke which decreases irritation both by
the heat, itself, and by the mix of compounds carried in the
smoke. Bubbled through water, water soluble irritants are
lessened. </p>

<p> Irritation from smoked cannabis can be minimized by using a
water pipe which will absorb some of the unwanted impurities and
cool the smoke. The cooler the smoke, the less irritation. The
use of hand rolled cannabis cigarettes &quot;joints&quot; add
additional impurities from the burning paper. The small burnt
down end of the joint, a &quot;roach&quot; has the hottest and
most irritating mix of impurities. </p>

<p> Irritation from hot, impurity laden smoke from the roach can
be diminished by holding the stub away from the lips with a tube
made from a rolled up paper. Better yet; use a pipe instead. </p>

<p> Pipes </p>

<p> The further from the throat and lungs, the cooler. A pipe
with a long stem is better than a short stem. </p>

<p> Water Pipes </p>

<p> Water pipes (and bongs) must provide adequate scrubbing of
the smoke with a minimum of &quot;dead space&quot; inside the
vessel. </p>

<p> Smoking techniques </p>

<p> In countries where cannabis is inexpensive and available like
Morocco and Nepal the cannabis smoker lights a pipe and smokes it
much like a tobacco pipe with a medium sized breath with
immediate exhaling. (and in Morocco tobacco is added) Coping with
scarce and expensive cannabis, the United States and European
cannabis smokers learn techniques to maximize the efficiency of
using the drug. The smoker exhales as much as possible before
taking in the puff of carbureted smoke with a puff of air
following to push it past the &quot;dead space&quot; of the
throat, trachea, and bronchi. The breath is then held for some
five seconds before exhaling. </p>

<p> Irritation from low grade cannabis is felt immediately but
irritation from high resin cannabis has a delay of a few seconds
before the irritation is felt. The user thinks &quot;this wasn't
so harsh&quot; before the fit of coughing begins as the receptors
in the lungs respond to the irritation by the resin. (This delay
may be from topical anesthetic properties of cannabis resin
slowing the transmission of signals from receptors to the nervous
system.) The user then adjusts by increasing the dilution of the
smoke with air on subsequent puffs. Continuing adjustment is
needed because of the variability of the quality and potency of
the illicit plant. Even long time experienced users still may be
seen with fits of coughing from inhaling too concentrated puffs
of smoke. Heavy cannabis smokers suffer a chronic bronchitis from
this irritation. &quot;As in long-continued and excessive
cigarette smoking considerable bronchial irritation and chronic
catarrhal laryngitis may be induced, so to may a similar
condition be caused by excessive ganja (buds of the female plant
without seeds) or charas (hashish) smoking...&quot; </p>

<p> Variable Potency </p>

<p> Unless there is access properly stored large supplies that
will last for long periods, the chronic cannabis user can expect
this variability. While the medicinal cannabis user of a century
ago may have had to put up with variability, under cannabis
prohibition today must cope with variability in addition to
expense and scarcity. </p>

<p> Because of the rapid onset of effects through the inhaled
route self adjustment of dose (autotitration) is easy. The user
stops when the desired state is attained and waits until the
effect starts to wear off before taking another puff. </p>

<p> Smoking Behavior: Set and Setting </p>

<p> Expectations and circumstance are important in the effects of
cannabis. The effect of the drug will be different in different
situations. Sitting alone or with friends in a safe and private
place versus speeding down the highway at the wheel of a car with
a police cruiser pulling up from behind, lights flashing, would
produce different effects. </p>

<p> Since we are not islands unto ourselves one must consider the
effects of smoking upon others which are not without
consequences. Putting oneself and others at risk are not
responsible behavior. Operation of any complicated machinery like
driving a car under the influence of cannabis is a poor idea. </p>

<p> Detection and capture </p>

<p> As long as cannabis is illegal being caught and punished is
far more dangerous to one's well-being than any of the effects of
the drug. Depending on one's circumstance, it may be the end to a
career path, employment, or reputation. The poisonous personal
effects from social sanctions should not be minimized. Cannabis
users must be discreet to avoid these most harmful of side
effects of ignorance and viciousness that will befall if found
out. Knowledge of cannabis use can easily be used for blackmail
in a Prohibition society. </p>

<p> Side stream Exposure </p>

<p> Your throat and lung irritation is undesirable. Exposing
others to these effects without agreement is even less desirable.
If you didn't like or were allergic to the smoke you wouldn't
want it inflicted upon you. Cannabis smoke tends to be less
noxious than tobacco smoke because there is less of it. Ten times
as expensive, the cannabis smokers take fewer puffs and hold
their breath for better absorption. Smokers of high potency
cannabis take even fewer puffs with less resultant exhaled smoke.
Avoid smoking in a closed or poorly ventilated space. </p>

<p> Passing the Pipe, Joint- and Maybe Disease </p>

<p> While passing the joint or pipe may be a primal social
behavior that add to feelings of acceptance and help the relaxing
effects of the drug, the user is exposed to all saliva borne
infectious diseases in the group. </p>

<p> How can one minimize this not so obvious but real risk in
cannabis use? </p>

<p> Don't share with others. Either smoke solo or pass up the
pipe or joint when it is passed your way. &quot;No thanks, I have
a cold and don't want to give it to you&quot; should be an
acceptable reason. </p>

<p> Don't let the pipe or joint touch your lips. Hold it so as to
inhale in such a way as not to let it touch. This may take some
practice. Others may think you are a bit strange. If you must use
a joint, put it in your own personal holder that is not shared. </p>

<p> [insert picture of hand with joint or holder] </p>

<p> Sterilize the mouthpiece of the pipe for a second with flame
or wipe it with an alcohol pad. </p>

<p> Vaporization; Safer Inhalation of Cannabinoids </p>

<p> The unique physical property of consistency like pine pitch
and lack of water solubility of the active principles of cannabis
pose unique problems for administration. </p>

<p> Heating cannabis to a temperature where the drug portion of
the plant turns into a vapor which can be inhaled without burning
is safer than smoking. Vaporization avoids exposing the throat
and lungs to the irritating and toxic products of combustion of
the crude plant. In the 5th century BC, Herodotus' description of
the Scythians throwing cannabis atop a fire in an enclosure and
inhaling the vapors may be a an early description of
vaporization- or an inexact translation confusing smoke for
vapor. </p>

<p> Tetrahydrocannabinols, Cannabidiols, and cannabinols vaporize
in the range of 400* Fahrenheit; below their ignition point.
These resinous portions come to a boil and condense into tiny
particles which are dispersed in a fine air emulsion that is then
inhaled. Vaporization devices have been around since the sixties
but, because of their inefficiency (and illegality as drug
paraphernalia), have never become popular. </p>

<p> Prototype Vaporizers </p>

<p> Cigarette lighter element &amp; chamber </p>

<p> Powdered cannabis is placed in a thin layer on the heating
element which is heated until white vapor appears in the chamber.
The vapor is inhaled through a tube in the floor of the chamber
(made from a small glass jar or bowl). </p>

<p> Shrink tubing heater </p>

<p> Powdered cannabis is placed on a small mesh brass screen in
glass funnel with rubber or plastic tubing for inhalation. A hand
held electric heater with a small fan used for heating shrink
tubing on electronic parts is calibrated with a thermometer held
in the stream of hot air. (400 degrees Fahrenheit). </p>

<p> Heated wire and extracted resin </p>

<p> Cannabis resin with the consistency of pine pitch is placed
dropwise on the end of an iron or steel wire which is then
applied to a hot soldering iron or glowing charcoal. The ensuing
puff of vapor is captured by a large drinking straw placed close
above the point where the droplet is applied inhaled through the
straw. The application is timed with the beginning of the taking
in of a breath. </p>

<p> Charcoal pellet and heat exchange chamber </p>

<p> Utilized by the Premier cigarette by the Phillip Morris Co.
developed and test marketed in 1989 before dropped after protests
from nicotine prohibitionists and poor sales. This device it was
claimed could be converted from using enclosed the nicotine
pellet to other drugs- namely crack cocaine. </p>

<p> Effects: Physical and Mental </p>

<p> The Bell shaped curve </p>

<p> Reactions to cannabis products vary from totally beneficial
and necessary for life, to harmful, dangerous, and to be avoided.
They can be life saving to life threatening. An AIDS wasting
patient whose appetite is restored or a person violently allergic
or sensitive to smoke </p>

<p> Dose Relationships </p>

<p> The combination of individual sensitivity with amount taken
add up to the effects experienced. Route of administration also
affects the results. Effects both in terms of intensity and
length are directly related. </p>

<p> Dose and Route of Administration </p>

<p> The inhaled route avoids overdose since the rapid onset of
effects permits the user to cease intake of the drug when the
level of drug effect is reached. The oral route with it's slow
onset and variable absorption after eating does not allow this
fine degree of control in the case of a single dose. </p>

<p> Site of action </p>

<p> Unlike other sedative compounds, cannabinoids have their
effect in the upper portions of the brain with physical effects
mediated downward, rather than affecting lower centers of the
brain as with alcohol, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines. </p>

<p> While the existence of receptor sites have been identified in
homogenates of rat brains using radioisotopes, precise anatomic
sites have not been located in humans. </p>

<p> The limbic system is a prime candidate as an area that lies
below the cerebral cortex and plays a significant role in
mediating connections with upper and lower centers within the
central nervous system. </p>

<p> [insert diagram of limbic system] </p>

<p> Effects on the central nervous system </p>

<p> Brain Wave Effects </p>

<p> Cannabis' effects on the electroencephalogram (EEG) are a
biphasic stimulation and sedation that are mediated by dose, set,
setting, physiology, and personality. Initially, there is a
speeding up of brain wave activity and a reactive slowing as the
drug effects wear off. The higher the dosage, the more intense
the effects and longer the experience. As the effects wear off,
the stimulation gives way to sedation. The buzzing ideation of
the beta state gives way to introspection, then dream imagery of
alpha and theta frequencies moving towards sleep. With continuing
low level use, the effects are less intense but more frequent in
need to take inhaled drug. </p>

<p> Stimulation of both beta and theta frequencies. </p>

<p> Beta waves, high frequency (&gt;14 Hz) reflect the increased
cognitive activity subjectively experienced as a &quot;flow of
ideas&quot; that characterize the onset of cannabis mental
effect. The distortion of time with this &quot;speeding up of
thoughts&quot; causes subjective perception that there is a
slowing of time. </p>

<p> Theta waves, low frequency (4-7 Hz) are seen with visual
imagery. These images break through a background of thinking and
disrupt the train of thought. The thinking is distracted by these
intrusions which then modify thought content to varying degrees,
depending on dose, expectations, setting, and personality. </p>

<p> Adverse Effects of Cannabis </p>

<p> As with any drug, cannabis is a tool. There will always be
individuals that experience adverse consequences from any drug
use. The abuse of cannabis has been recognized for millennia.
These problems were described by O'Shaughnessey during his
observations in India in 1839 which included references in the
Persian medical literature. With widespread non medical use of
the drug for the past thirty years, psychiatrists have developed
classifications of cannabis presented in the latest Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual, Revision IV (DSM-IV) </p>

<p> Intoxication/Overdose </p>

<p> Overdose is most common by the oral route since the time from
taking the drug until the experience of effects begin is from one
to three or more hours. Inexperienced and ignorant first time
users will have an unforgettable experience. </p>

<p> The effects of overdose have been numerously described in
general, clinical, and scientific literature. Cannabis overdose
comprises the majority of listings in the Surgeon General's List,
19th century precursor of the Indicus Medicus. American literary
accounts in books: FizHugh Ludlow's Hasheesh Eater and An Essay
on Hasheesh by Victor Robinson M.D. are expressly devoted to
cannabis. Descriptions of experience with the drug as part of
travel to areas of indigenous use may be found in English and
European literature over the past three centuries. Scientific and
medical descriptions of effects of cannabis overdose have been
numerous extensive. Before and after its removal in 1937. </p>

<p> The effects of overdose are from the stimulation and sedation
of the central nervous system. Stimulation with a flooding of
ideas and images that are vivid and rapidly changing. Attention
and concentration are markedly impaired. Time perception is
significantly altered with minutes seeming like hours. There may
be distortion of spatial perception. </p>

<p> Secondary physical effects, aside from a speeding up of the
heart rate from the central nervous system stimulation, are
remarkable in their absence. The acceleration of the heart rate
is generally no more than that associated with mild to moderate
exercise. </p>

<p> Cannabis-Induced Disorders </p>

<p> 292.89 Cannabis Intoxication </p>

<p> A. Recent use of cannabis. </p>

<p> B. Clinically significant maladaptive behavioral or
psychological changes (e.g., impaired motor coordination,
euphoria, anxiety, sensation of slowed time, impaired judgment,
social withdrawal) that developed during, or shortly after,
cannabis use. </p>

<p> C. Two (or more) of the following signs, developing within </p>

<p> 2 hours of cannabis use: (1) conjunctival injection (2)
increased appetite (3) dry mouth (4) tachycardia </p>

<p> D. The symptoms are not due to a general medical condition
and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder. </p>

<p> Specify if: </p>

<p> With Perceptual Disturbances: This specifier may be noted
when hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory,
visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium.
Intact reality testing means that the person knows that the
hallucinations are induced by the substance and do not represent
external reality. When hallucinations occur in the absence of
intact reality testing, a diagnosis of Substance-Induced
Psychotic Disorder, With Hallucinations should be considered. </p>

<p> 292.81 Cannabis Intoxication Delirium </p>

<p> 292.11 Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder, With Delusions
Specify if With Onset During Intoxication </p>

<p> 292.12 Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder, With
Hallucinations Specify if With Onset During Intoxication </p>

<p> 292.89 Cannabis-Induced Anxiety Disorder Specify if: With
Onset During Intoxication </p>

<p> Continuing or chronic use. </p>

<p> Use or abuse? Cannabis, like any other drug, is a tool.
Properly utilized with realistic expectations and awareness of
its properties, cannabis is a safe and effective medicine.
Improperly used with unrealistic expectations and ignorance,
adverse effects may result. The onset of unwanted effects may be
obvious or insidious. The general etiology is some emotional
discomfort for which cannabis is taken to relieve producing
undesirable consequences from using the drug itself. </p>

<p> Paranoia and delusional thinking are not uncommon effects of
cannabis both acute and chronically. In the acute experience it
appears to be from the perceptual distortions of space, time and
feelings of detachment. </p>

<p> In chronic use paranoid and delusional thinking appear to be
the consequences of the suppression of feelings, The dulling of
feelings may alienate the cannabis users from others by
diminishing empathetic capabilities. This emotional insensitivity
then results in conflict through misperception. Misperception
results from the dulling of affect that is important contextual
collateral information source. An effective relief of emotional
distress then becomes an impediment to relationships with the
cannabis user. Feelings are an integral dimension of social
perception that convey important contextual information.
Cannabis, as an effective sedative and antidepressant, has this
undesirable side effect when misused. The relief afforded by the
drug may be paid for by complications caused by avoiding dealing
with the causes of the emotional pain as well as diminished
functioning while under its influence. </p>

<p> Cognitive impairment by continuing or overuse of cannabis
creates a form of mild dementia that may persist for up to
several weeks after discontinuing the drug. Individuals sensitive
to the drug report a persistent &quot;hangover&quot; that
diminishes the ability to pay attention and concentrate. The
onset may be insidious, subtle, and gradual. This condition is
reversible with abstinence from cannabis. </p>

<h1>Marijuana Addicts Anonymous </h1>

<p> <b>by Lance B.</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> An article in the June 23, 1987 Oakland Tribune caught my
eye: &quot;Grass not always green for long term marijuana
users&quot; described the formation of Marijuana Addicts
Anonymous on the Alcoholics Anonymous' 12 step model. </p>

<p> I put a quarter in the can and poured myself a cup of Peet's
espresso and was shown the stash of real half-and-half in the
refridge instead of the simulated dairy creamer out on the
counter. Flavoured mineral waters and juices for reasonable
donations gave the scene a definite Berkeley ambience. </p>

<p> After overcoming my behavioural denial &quot;mistake&quot; of
going to the wrong address and leaving the newspaper article with
the correct address at home that set my visit back by a week I
finally arrived at the meeting place. </p>

<p> Housed in a defunct computer software house's office building
now dedicated to drug treatment. </p>

<p> I had to rehearse it numerous times before going in.
&quot;Hi, I'm Lance and I'm a marijuana addict&quot;, smile, and
seem sincere. The words choked in my throat at first but became
easier as I set the script in place to be recited. A room in the
back was populated with angular chrome/naugahyde stacking chairs,
a heterogeneous grouping of 20 to 30 men and women from early
20's to late 40's sat down in a circle and recited the
&quot;serenity prayer&quot;. </p>

<p> I studied the handouts I collected from the table. Blurry
gray but readable copies of the lists of the 12 steps, serenity
prayer, 12 questions. There was an undated hit piece by Daryl
Inaba, recent convert to the NEW STRONGER DANGEROUS marijuana
federal mythology that enumerated the usual litany of brain
damage, immune system suppression, higher addictive potential,
lung cancer liability, and harm to sexual functioning. While all
of these claimed adverse effects are still problematic and
indelibly tainted by the current policy of &quot;its the signal
we send them&quot; school of psychopharmacology, the significant
role of marijuana in facilitating other drug dependencies Inaba
cites appears to have merit. </p>

<p> Fred, an extroverted unemployed mid-thirtyish balding man
with workingman plaid cotton flannel shirt and thick glasses who
giggled nervously, fidgeting, was chosen to read the
&quot;Questions&quot; The following questions may help you
determine whether marijuana is a problem in your life:
&quot;(insert 12 questions) He later went onto describe his other
difficulties with paranoid schizophrenia and alcoholism. His
monologue became disjointed and he would laugh an inappropriate
laugh that sounded mighty stoned- the way weed made me feel 20
years ago. </p>

<p> For a few moments when different members of the group
responded with the same laughs I felt the dry contact high. </p>

<p> Fred also attended AA meetings as did over half the group to
deal with concurrent problems with alcohol. The protocol and
routines of AA were easily modified to center on difficulties
with marijuana abuse and dependence. </p>

<p> &quot;Hi! I'm Cindy. I'm a marijuana addict.&quot; The
temporary chair, Cindy, a slender woman in her mid 20's with a
broad-jawed attractive face with aquiline nose described how it
dulled her ability to do her ceramics and caused her to become
withdrawn and shut down. </p>

<p> Helen, a short tense voluptuous woman in her late 20's
described difficulties dealing with the feelings of anger she now
attempts to cope with by working through instead of using
marijuana to suppress her feelings. She described confronting her
need to quit when her therapist refused to see her if she didn't.
The group applauded her staying straight for the last month. </p>

<p> Bob, a rather overweight man in his mid twenties described
undergoing a brush with temptation and death over the weekend
when out hiking in the Mt Shasta area he stumbled into a
marijuana patch and was confronted by the armed growers. He
managed to talk his way out of the situation but was sorely
tempted to buy some. He obsessed about it all the way back to San
Francisco and has memorized the way to find the patch should he
plan to go back up. </p>

<p> He still might. </p>

<p> Rick, a fourth year law student at Hastings in San Francisco
described his need to give up cannabis after having detoxed and
stayed clean from alcohol for the past six weeks. If he let
himself go to pot it set him up to fall of the wagon and take
that critical drink that would end in an uncontrollable binge. </p>

<p> Grace, a hefty dark hispanic in her 30's, brought along her
two preadolescent daughters who sat quietly on the chairs or on
the floor listening. A single parent divorcee grappling with her
other main addiction of overeating to cope with her bad feelings
as an adult child of an alcoholic family. </p>

<p> Many who attended AA or NA meetings complained that neither
group would give appropriate support to participants concerned
with kicking the cannabis habit. The AA groups, of course, were
centered around alcohol. The NA groups were dominated by the
heroinists and cocaine compulsives that discounted the concern
with cannabis dependence. </p>

<p> The topic of the evening was denial. The moderator of the
meeting after giving his potalog of his difficulties caused by
his cannabis habit and then called for a volunteer to speak out.
The substance may be different from alcohol but the addiction
process is the same. </p>

<p> Denial springs like crab grass on the lawn needing
extirpation all the time. </p>

<p> &quot;Im ____ and I'm a marijuana addict&quot; &quot;Hi
_____&quot; the group choruses in response. </p>

<p> Avoiding the weed is a preoccupation that brings as a
consequence the dealing with emotional issues nakedly instead of
with the help of that mild sedative that cuts down the fear and
anger reactions. Everything goes along OK until something goes
wrong and then without thinking a joint is rolled and smoked.
Back to square one. </p>

<p> Trying to interpose the detached less reactive
marijuana-stoned self unfortunately has the consequence of
emotionally distancing one from others with resulting problems
with family and friends. Additionally, the sedation and spaciness
from the weed cuts into concentration that causes problems on the
job with the secondary worries from the impaired performance. </p>

<p> There were no horror stories of broken homes, violence,
writhing-on-the-floor withdrawal but minor irritability,
nightmares during the first week and then the yearnings for the
herb in a social situation when it was offered by friends. The
biggest factor in relapse was some stressful event. </p>

<p> As the hour and a half drew to a close the secretary of the
meeting called for business announcements before all joined hands
in a circle and recited the closing prayer. </p>

<p> After the meeting outside the back door many of the members
carried on conversations in small knots- lighting up and often
passing around nicotine cigarettes. Overcoming addictions is a
step-by-step, drug-by-drug process for the afflicted is a
life-long personal struggle. </p>

<p> Three members were looking over hand drawn tentative designs
for a logo for the first chapter of Marijuana Addicts Anonymous
in the world here in Berkeley with gossip about some proprietary
marijuana dependence treatment groups. One of these for profit
groups back on the east coast have already laid claim to a
marijuana leaf with a red slashed circle superimposed. </p>

<p> There was clearly group pride and cohesiveness. This was
indeed a group of self-helpers that are there to help its members
hang on from week to week without the heavy exploitive hand of
government agencies. Telephone numbers are exchanged so that a
member in danger of relapse can reach out in his or her time of
need. </p>

<p> MAA now meets in Berkeley and Oakland in two different
locations three times a week. A new chapter will probably start
up soon in San Francisco. I admitted after the meeting to a few
people that I was active with NORML which didn't seem to put them
off. I suggested that MAA solicit support from NORML since we all
agreed the criminalization of marijuana didn't help anything...
at least these individuals didn't. When I told NORML's west coast
coordinator he liked the idea and will attend MAA with me in two
weeks. Who knows? </p>

<p> Lance B. </p>

<p> Berkeley, California </p>

<p> August 12, 1987 </p>

<p> Meeting number two was dominated by the potalog of Sheila an
attractive blonde female physician in her early thirties who was
recovering from alcohol and then finally kicking the pot habit
described her feelings of loss of control as she found herself
screaming at her patients. Speaking in a barely audible voice she
described her success in dealing with the emotions she once
suppressed with cannabis and other chemicals. </p>

<p> The number in attendance was pushing 30 and many were eager
to share their stories of temptation and travail. The speakers
would make efforts to refer to the previous offerings giving
liberal strokes of acknowledgment of similarity or pertinence to
his or her situation. </p>

<h1>Marinol and Cannabis </h1>

<p align="center"><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.*</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>Marinol </b>(dronabinol) delta -9 tetrahydrocannabinol
dissolved in sesame oil. Supplied in fixed doses of 2.5, 5, and
10 milligram soft gelatin capsules. Taken orally. </p>

<p><b>Cannabis</b> extract: 9 known delta -9
Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p>2 known delta -8 Tetrahydrocannabinols </p>

<p>50 other cannabinoids that may interact with or modify
reactions with the Tetrahydrocannabinols, the primary active
principles. <i>Source: Marijuana and Health Institute of
Medicine, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1982, P13-15</i>
</p>

<p>Cannabis may be ingested orally or inhaled. Inhalation may be
smoked or vaporized. </p>

<p>Anecdotal reports of users of both Marinol and cannabis
describe enhancement or constructive supplementation. Others who
have tried both have described cannabis as superior to Marinol.
Users of cannabis usually inhale. </p>

<p><b>Oral vs Inhalation:</b> Oral ingestion of either cannabis
or Marinol is characterized by: </p>

<p>delayed onset of effects, variable level of effects, and
prolonged effects. Inhalation provides quick onset of effects,
consistent level of effects, and shorter lasting effects. </p>

<p>The inhalation route is significantly more consistently
effective. </p>

<p><b>Inhalation: Vaporization vs Smoke</b> </p>

<p>Significant irritants and toxic products are produced by
combustion which can be minimized by vaporizing
Tetrahydrocannabinols and other cannabinoids.
Tetrahydrocannabinols vaporize at 400 Fahrenheit. Two crude
prototypes have been successfully demonstrated: a modified
manually operated auto cigarette lighter element, and a heat gun
for electronic shrink tubing set at 400 F. Unfortunately,
vaporizers are currently defined by law as illegal paraphernalia.
</p>

<p><b>Clinical Research Needed</b> </p>

<p>Only <i>clinical</i> research comparing Marinol to other
Tetrahydrocannabinols and cannabinoids for therapeutic efficacy
can clarify this controversy. </p>

<p>Tentative and preliminary clinical findings indicate a
significant difference between Marinol and natural crude cannabis
preparations in favor of the crude product. Route of
administration and fixed incremental dosage may be factors in
comparative efficacy and unwanted effects. </p>

<h1>Chronic Migraine Headache: </h1>

<h2>five cases successfully treated with Marinol and/or illicit
cannabis. </h2>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 1 </h2>

<p>A thirty eight year old white female stock broker supervisor
with a twenty-six year history of unilateral vascular headaches
escalating to generalized headache with tension headache overlay.
The severity and frequency of episodes responded only to
parenteral dihydroergotamine, meperidine, and trimethobenzamide
HCl with sedation and further immobilization. </p>

<p>Marinol (delta 1-9 tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame
oil) was begun with gradual upward titration dropwise to avoid
undesirable mental side effects. She experienced a significant
decrease in the frequency of attacks except when she ran out of
medication. </p>

<p>She tolerated 40 mg daily (10 mg QID) without side effects but
experienced an attack after running out of the THC capsules.
Because of financial straits secondary to her disability status
and the high expense of Marinol she has partially substituted
illicitly obtained marijuana which she has ingested orally with
similar relief. </p>

<p>Over the past four years she has maintained better control
over the attacks with only one trip to the emergency room for a
meperidine treatment in the past two years. She continues to
utilize illicit cannabis because of the high cost of Marinol but
has difficulty with irregular dosage with either too little or
too much. </p>

<h2>Case 2 </h2>

<p>Her mother, a 58 year old hospital ward clerk who has
experienced migraine headaches with similar symptoms but less
profoundly debilitating than those of her daughter.Likewise, she
was treated with a gradually increasing dosageof Marinol with
stabilization at a 10 mg daily dose (5 mg BID).Notwithstanding
her undergoing stressful conditions on the job she experienced
successful stopping of episodes in prodromal stage. </p>

<p>Left neck numbness, anorexia, water retention and left
diplopia were reversed with normalization of gastric motility,
diuresis,and peripheral vasodilation. She subjectively felt a
relief of affectual pressure. She experienced no debilitating
side effects as with other antimigraine agents and sedatives.
Perceptually she described a &quot;shift of vision&quot;-
slightly out of focus. This effect was transient. </p>

<h2>Case 3 </h2>

<p>A 44 year old female teacher has a thirty year history of
familial unilateral severe vascular headaches with antecedent
visual scotomata. She switched to self-medication with marijuana
after 9 years of </p>

<p>meperidine/sedative treatments with their impairing effects. </p>

<h2>Cases 4 &amp; 5 </h2>

<p>She taught her daughters ages 21 and 17 to self-medicate with
marijuana with similar success in aborting migraine headaches in
the prodromal phase with scotomata. </p>

<h2>Discussion </h2>

<p>While hemp drugs (cannabis) were introduced to western
medicine by O'Shaughnessy in 1839 and attained wide usage until
the turn of the century with the development of synthetic and
semisynthetic analgesics.Their use declined though maintaining
mention in medical texts until removal from the formulary in
1940. Reclassified as a schedule I drug in 1970 alleged to having
no medicinal redeeming importance, the synthetic THC created by
government sponsored research contractors was downscheduled to II
in 1986, the same as non-combination opiates requiring triplicate
prescription. </p>

<p>Grinspoon has recently described use of cannabinoids
therapeutically for migraine. </p>

<p>It would appear that further clinical trial of both Marinol
and cannabis for the treatment of migraine headache would be
desirable. </p>

<h1>CANNABIS AND MARINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF MIGRAINE HEADACHE </h1>

<p><b>by</b> </p>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>Edie L., a thirty eight year old pert, intense, intelligent,
articulate stock broker and former law student suffers from
severe one-sided headaches that started when she was eleven years
old. Aggravated by bacon, wines, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce,
and complicated by severe menstrual cramping, she had been
virtually house bound for weeks at a time. If the immobilizing
pain, nausea, and depression from the attacks weren't bad enough,
the side effects from conventional pharmacotherapy wrought
further dysfunction. </p>

<p>Sedatives like phenobarbital and minor tranquilizers like
Valium and Ativan left her sleepy and oversedated. Trips to the
emergency room were frequent where Demerol (meperidine) and
ergotamine (up to 3 injections in 24 hours) would bring the
attack under control. </p>

<p>She had been to numerous specialists and underwent extensive
workups including spinal taps, brain wave studies, xrays, allergy
tests, and psychiatric interviews. </p>

<p>She made the observation that if she smoked marijuana just as
the symptoms of an attack were starting that the attack could be
kept at bay or stopped. She told this to several specialists who
were treating her but this was either ignored or dismissed. </p>

<p>Because I could not prescribe marijuana Marinol was
prescribed. Starting dropwise from puncturing a 10 milligram
capsule using a method described by Dr. J. Russell Reynolds in
1890:&quot;The dose should be given in minimum quantity, repeated
in not less than four or six hours, and gradually increased by
one drop every third or fourth day, until either relief is
obtained, or the drug is proved, in such case, to be
useless.&quot; </p>

<p>Actually, the adjustment of the dose came more easily. She
found that her response to Marinol was not exquisitely sensitive
and within several days she found that 10 milligrams two or three
times a day was sufficient. The migraine attacks ceased.
Subjectively, the Marinol did not cause sedation or immobility as
with the other drugs but produced a feeling of well-being and
relieved feelings of depression. The other medications worsened
feelings of depression and immobility. </p>

<p>The expense of Marinol was, unfortunately prohibitive, causing
her to have to resort to illicit cannabis of varying potency.
Because of her continuing intermittantly severe recurrent
depression and premigraine anxiety, she has been unable to return
to work. On follow-up four years later she has had &quot;..only
one meperidine trip to the emergency room in the past two
years.&quot; She makes oral preparations using inexpensive
Mexican marijuana. She complains of not being able to optimize
the potency of her confections because of the varying potencies
and small quantities she must prepare. She also must resort to
smoking marijuana which is her route of least preference.
Notwithstanding, the use of cannabis for the treatment of
migraine headache and depression has proven to be better than any
of the previous conventional drug treatments she has been
prescribed. </p>

<p>Edie's case is not without precedent. A physician of a century
ago would have prescribed cannabis in one of the many purified
preparations that were available. Today, most physicians,
including headache specialists, are unaware of this and or that
Marinol is one of the active principles of cannabis. </p>

<p>Migraine Headache is a specific type of pain for which
cannabis was first described to be useful by J. Russell Reynolds
. After some thirty years clinical experience after this initial
observation, he described &quot;Migraine: very many victims have
for years kept their sufferings in abeyance by taking hemp at the
moment of threatening, or onset of the attack.&quot; In Osler's
medical text it was the treatment of choice for migraine
headache. The most recent (and last) mention of cannabis for the
treatment of migraine was from Morris Fishbein, M.D., Editor of
the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1942. </p>

<h1>Toxic Effects of Marijuana </h1>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Individual Toxicity</b> </p>

<p>The smoked use of cannabis is not without hazards which should
be clearly recognized so as to permit appropriate action to avoid
or minimize these untoward effects. </p>

<p><b>Physical Effects</b> </p>

<p>The smoke of cannabis is irritating to the mouth, throat,
trachea, bronchii, and lungs. The level of irritation is
comparable to that of tobacco with the level of irritation
dependent upon the amount of exposure, heat of the smoke and
degree of impurity. Because of it's illegality it is not yet
possible to scientifically document the possible connection with
actual lung disease. </p>

<p>For similar reasons it is not possible to determine possible
adverse effects upon passive exposure to marijuana smoke. </p>

<p>There are some people that are allergic to marijuana smoke and
develop hives or asthmatic symptoms when exposed to it. </p>

<p><b>Mental Effects</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis when smoked may cause confusion and disorientation in
the inexperienced or sensitive user. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Mikuriya's Credentials</b> </p>

<p>For the past twenty five years Dr. Mikuriya studied the
effects of marijuana professionally in capacities of drug abuse
treatment program director, research psychiatrist for the federal
government, visitor to endemic areas of use, general clinician
treating acute psychiatric in-patients and outpatients. </p>

<p>Politically, he was on the board of directors of the
California Marijuana Initiatives of 1972 - 74, Amorphia and an
advisor to its successor, the National Organization to Reform the
Marijuana Laws (NORML). </p>

<p>A graduate of Reed College, Mikuriya completed his medical
education at Temple University Medical School, Philadelphia. He
received his psychiatric specialty training at Oregon State
Hospital in Salem and Mendocino State Hospital in northern
California. After serving at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric
Institute at Princeton, Mikuriya was appointed first director of
marijuana research at the National Institute of Mental Health,
Chevy Chase, Maryland in 1967. Since then he has been in private
psychiatric practice in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley.
Mikuriya has published numerous papers on marijuana and is the
editor and publisher of Marijuana Medical Papers. </p>

<p> Abstract </p>

<h1>CANNABIS MEDICINAL USES AT A &quot;BUYERS'&quot; CLUB </h1>

<p> <b>Mikuriya, T.H. </b> </p>

<p> <b>Medicinal uses of cannabis at a buyers' club ___:
_____________ 1995</b> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> Background. A century ago, cannabis was regarded as the
second most important analgesic after the opiates for the control
of chronic pain. At the time of its removal from prescriptive
availability in 1938 it was recognized as a sedative and
antispasmodic. </p>

<p> Methods. 57 buyers of cannabis for self-medication were
interviewed by the author at the Cannabis Buyers' Club of San
Francisco utilizing a structured medical interview outline. </p>

<p> Results. 51 were male, 6 female, ranging in age from 18 to 69
with the median of 38 years. Race: 50 were white, 3 Hispanic, 2
Black, 1 Oriental, and 1 Samoan. Education ranged from 7th grade
to post doctoral study. Medical characteristics of the population
were 41 HIV+ and 16 Presumed HIV-. Time since HIV+ diagnosis
ranged from 1 month to 10 years with a median of 40 months.
Medicinal purposes reported were:
anorexia/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea 39, anxiety/panic
attacks/depression 39, AIDS related illness 35, arthritis and
other pain 22, muscle spasm 19, harm reduction: alcohol
substitution 12, opiod substitution 6, amphetamine substitution
1, followed by migraine/vascular headache 11, cancer/cancer
chemotherapy 10, asthma/cough 9, itching/hiccough 8, epilepsy 5,
glaucoma 4, drusen of the optic chiasm 1, psychiatric post
traumatic stress disorder 1, and pre menstrual syndrome 1. Of the
19 who tried Marinol* none experienced equipotent effects, 7
experienced partial relief without adverse side effects, 5
experienced no effects, and 7 experienced adverse side effects. </p>

<p> Conclusions. Cannabis is not a new drug. Medicinal
applications reported by self-medicating buyers would appear to
reconfirm descriptions in clinical literature before the drug was
removed from prescriptive availability. Further clinical study is
warranted. Restoration of cannabis to prescriptive availability
is indicated. </p>

<p> MEDICINAL USES OF CANNABIS AT A BUYERS' CLUB: A PILOT STUDY </p>

<p> by </p>

<p> Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D. </p>

<p> Background </p>

<p> From 1839 to 1938 cannabis was available by prescription and
utilized for a variety of conditions before removal after the
passage of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act at which time it was an
infrequently used sedative and antispasmodic . Since then it has
been legally defined as having no medicinal redeeming virtue
having high potential for abuse by the Controlled Substances Act
of 1970 as a Schedule I drug. </p>

<p> Recent History </p>

<p> Compassionate clinical investigative new drug (IND)
applications for marijuana were suspended in 1991 by then chief
of the Public Health Service James O. Mason, M.D. </p>

<p> Starting with a coalition of marijuana law reform and AIDS
treatment/prevention activists in the San Francisco gay community
a proposition was put on the ballot later that year to restore
hemp medical preparations for prescribing. The measure passed by
a 4:1 margin that resulted in passage of a supportive resolution
by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors that urged the District
Attorney to allow a letter from a treating physician to be
evidence of medical use. </p>

<p> In December, 1993 the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club
began to sell illicit cannabis to patients with a referral note
from their physician or health facility. </p>

<p> Interviews at the site by the author with 57 of the buyers
using a structured questionnaire (attached) provided the
following data regarding medical conditions and drug use. </p>

<p> Setting. Several doors away from a busy street corner is a
nondescript door with a peep lens. Pressing the doorbell between
the hours of 10 AM to 7 PM weekdays, the door is opened by a
doorman who asks to see the numbered club card. At the top of a
short flight of stairs, a second hall person of hefty stature
scrutinizes and greets the visitor. Entering midway in a large
old former dime-a-dance hall above the bar below, the room is
well lit from clerestory windows. The ceiling is covered by a
huge rainbow flag. The walls are covered with local artists' work
and political posters. Two small rooms to the right are a kitchen
with sink and refrigerator with access to the roof and an
interview room. A sink and toilet are off the short hallway to
the interview room. </p>

<p> The well ventilated rooms with open windows and a corner
15&quot; exhaust fan left from the dance hall era are needed to
cope with the clouds of cannabis (and some tobacco) smoke from
the patrons. A large old dining room table dominates the center
of the room, a semicircle of sofas at the left, and smaller
tables against the wall on the right accommodate the buyers.
Joints are rolled, pipes and water pipes are filled and shared
from medium grade cannabis furnished by the house on small trays.
The dealers measure out the cannabis from behind a
&quot;bar&quot; where buyers inspect and purchase cannabis.
Grades, types and prices are posted behind the bar on an erasable
board with samples of each available for inspection and trial.
Pipes, cigarette lighters, and rolling papers are also sold at
the counter. In addition to smoked cannabis baked goods for oral
use are sold. Cookies and brownies made from the lower grade
cannabis are bioassayed by the bakers and staff with rough
estimates of strength provided for each batch. On the periphery,
tables with diverse health and informational literature provides
reading materials for the buyers. Stationary, postage, and lists
of politicians provide other activities for buyers, staff, and
visitors. </p>

<p> Demographics </p>

<p> There were 51 men and 6 women. Their ages ranged from 18 to
69, with the median of 38 years. Education was from 7th grade to
post doctoral professionals. Racially, 50 were white, 3 hispanic,
2 black, 1 oriental, and 1 samoan. </p>

<p> Medical Characteristics </p>

<p> 41 were HIV+ with 35 seeking treatment of AIDS related
illness. The shortest time since diagnosis 1 month, the longest
time was 10 years with 40 months the median, and 53.8 months the
average. </p>

<p> The 16 presumed HIV- were 13 males and 3 females ages 23 to
69 years with a median of 36 with an average of 45.5 years of
age. The racial composition was 13 white, 1 Hispanic 1 Black and
1 Oriental. </p>

<p> Symptoms and Conditions </p>

<p> Gastrointestinal and affective conditions were the most
frequent with anorexia/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, anxiety/panic
attacks, and insomnia/depression (39 each). The second most
numerous category was the musculoskeletal with Arthritis and
other pain (22). The third most frequently mentioned target
symptom was muscle spasm (19) </p>

<p> Harm reduction through substitution of cannabis for more
toxic drugs: alcohol (12), sedative/opiates (6), amphetamine (1)
was the fourth most mentioned category. Migraine/vascular
headache (11) was the fifth largest category followed by:
asthma/cough (9), Itching/hiccough (8) Epilepsy (5) Glaucoma (4)
Post traumatic stress disorder (1) drusen of the optic chiasm (1)
</p>

<p> Allergic rhinitis 0 1 1 </p>

<p> Pre Menstrual Syndrome 0 1 1 </p>

<p> Past experience with cannabis </p>

<p> All had used the drug recreationally prior to self
medication. The shortest length of time since first use was 4
months, the longest was 48 years with the median of 14 years of
using cannabis. </p>

<p> Dosage and Frequency of Use of Cannabis </p>

<p> The range of dose varied from two puffs on a pipe every two
weeks to more than one cannabis cigarettes 6 times a day. The
modal frequency was one or less cigarette or equivalent daily. </p>

<p> Route of Administration </p>

<p> Fifty smoked cannabis. Three ate cannabis only. The marijuana
cigarette or &quot;joint&quot; was the most frequently used with
38, a pipe was second most popular with 27, water pipe third with
11. </p>

<p> Three inhaled but did not smoke. They utilized a vaporizer
that permits delivery of cannabinoids at temperatures below the
flash or burning point. </p>

<p> Twenty three both ate and smoked the drug. </p>

<p> Of the three cases who only ate the drug, all had significant
pulmonary pathology. One suffered recurrent fungal infections:
aspergillosis and cryptococcus, one had pneumocystis carinii
(PCP), and the third, recurrent bacterial pneumonitis and AIDS
encephalopathy. </p>

<p> Marinol, a legally available monocannabinoid, has been
promoted as a viable alternative to crude polycannabinoids. </p>

<p> Of the 19 who described experience with Marinol, only 3 knew
what dose they had taken. 5 experienced no effects or side
effects, 7 felt it was somewhat helpful without adverse side
effects. </p>

<p> The symptoms for which Marinol was somewhat helpful were: 5
Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, 4 Depression and 1 with post
traumatic injury pain. All of the dose levels were unknown. </p>

<p> Of the 7 who experienced adverse effects from Marinol, 5
complained of lethargy, tiredness and over sedation, 2 of
confusion, (one with a 30 milligram dose, the other of an unknown
dose), three described a worsening of the target symptoms of
nausea (all at unknown dosage), one experienced a transient
diploplia at an unknown dose, and one of a generalized headache
from 10 milligrams. </p>

<p> Discussion </p>

<p> It would appear that naturally occurring polycannabinoid
cannabis is superior to monocannabinoid dronabinol but that
dronabinol gives partial relief for some. Supplementing Marinol
with crude cannabis appears to decrease the intake of crude
cannabis. </p>

<p> Cannabis has been described as having therapeutic properties
in a variety of conditions in clinical literature prior to its
removal from prescriptive availability in 1938. Interviews with a
status criminalized population of 57 individuals with serious
illness self-medicating at a &quot;medical speakeasy&quot;,
confirm many of the pre prohibition therapeutic uses of cannabis.
</p>

<p> The wide variety of conditions appear to have some common
elements of affective, autonomic, and anti-inflammatory effects
that warrant further systematic clinical study. Burstine suggests
the inhibition of prostaglandin secretions modulated by
eicosanoids, complex fatty acids, caused by certain
tetrahydrocannabinols may be one of the mechanisms of action.
Indications of NSAID activity appear in the inhibition of
marihuana effects by premedication with indomethacin. </p>

<p> William B. O'Shaughnessy, M.D., who in 1839 introduced
cannabis to western medicine, acknowledged its non-medical use
but was able to recognize and study its therapeutic potential
despite the drug's adverse reputation. While much has been
learned scientifically of mechanisms of actions, adverse social
attitudes continue to prevent clinical study for therapeutic
potential. </p>

<p> The existence of this &quot;buyers' club, per se, (some 2,000
members) appears to functionally contradict official
pronouncements denying the therapeutic uses of cannabis and is a
compensatory social excrescence of Prohibition as a public
policy. </p>

<h1>Vaporization of Cannabinoids: a Preferable Drug Delivery
Route </h1>

<p> <center>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D. </center> </p>

<p> <img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </p>

<p> <b>Oral vs Inhaled</b> </p>

<p> While cannabis used medicinally has generally utilized the
oral route, certain difficulties have been recognized since its
introduction to western medicine by O'Shaughnessey in 1839. The
most common entry in the Surgeon General's List, 19th century
precursor to the Indicus Medicus described overdose. While not
physically harmful, the mental effects were alarming. </p>

<p> While the oral cannabis ingestion using gradual upward
titration may take days, oral cannabis' absorbtion rates vary,
depending on motility and contents of the gastrointestinal tract.
Inhaled cannabis by contrast produces much more rapid onset of
effect (within minutes compared with hours), reliable effect, and
accurate autotitration. </p>

<p> The current use of cigarette or pipe for the inhaling of
cannabinoids is recognized as delivering numerous irritants and
possible carcinogens along with the desired active principles to
the tracheobronchial tree and oral cavity. Vaporization separates
out the more therapeutic chemical components from the crude plant
or resin impurities and breakdown products of pyrrolysis. </p>

<p> The vaporization temperature range is significantly below the
flash point and pyrrolytic temperature of cannabinoids and
non-cannabinoid components of crude cannabis. </p>

<p> There are some 421 identified compounds in cannabis, 61 of
which are cannabinoids. All of these compounds are pyrrolyzed
into numerous degradation products which are delivered to the
respiratory tract through the process of smoking.** </p>

<p> Any mitigation of irritation to the oral cavity and
tracheobroncheal tree in the delivery of active principles of
cannabis- especially in the chronic marijuana user would be
inherently safer. For the immunocompromised, debilitated, or in
respiratory distress possibly life saving. </p>

<p> A program to study the physical and therapeutic properties
including asthma which would utilize the therapeutic properties
of the drug without the drawback of the irritation to the lungs. </p>

<p> Systematic evaluation of specific vaporization temperature
ranges is required to better differentiate and characterize the
optimal combinations of cannabinoids for different symptoms and
conditions. </p>

<h1>THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</h1>

<p><b>Full Text of the Marihuana Tax Act as passed in 1937</b> </p>

<p>Introduction (in italics) by David Solomon<br>
</p>

<p><em>The popular and therapeutic uses of hemp preparations are
not categorically prohibited by the provisions of the Marihuana
Tax Act of 1937. The apparent purpose of the Act is to levy a
token tax of approximately one dollar on all buyers, sellers,
importers, growers, physicians, veterinarians, and any other
persons who deal in marijuana commercially, prescribe it
professionally, or possess it. </em></p>

<p><em>The deceptive nature of that apparent purpose begins to
come into focus when the reader reaches the penalty provisions of
the Act: five years' imprisonment, a $2,000 fine, or both seem
rather excessive for evading a sum (provided for by the purchase
of a Treasury Department tax stamp) that, even if collected,
would produce only a minute amount of government revenue. (Fines
and jail sentences were f urther increased to the point of the
cruel and unusual in subsequent federal drug legislation that
incorporated the Marijuana Tax Act. It is now possible under the
later version of the Act to draw a life sentence for selling just
one marihuana cigarette to a minor.) One might wonder, too, why a
small clause, amounting to an open-ended catchall provision, was
inserted into the Act, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury
to grant the Commissioner (then Harry Anslinger) and agents of
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Narcotics absolute
administrative regulatory, and police powers in the enforcement
of the law. The message becomes entirely clear when, having
finished the short text of the Act itself, one proceeds to the
sixty-odd pages of administrative and enforcement procedures
established by the infamous Regulations No. 1. That regulation,
not fully reproduced here, calls for a maze of affidavits,
depositions, sworn statements, and constant Treasury Department
police inspection in every instance that marijuana is bought,
sold, used, raised, distributed, given away, and so on.
Physicians who wish to purchase the one-dollar tax stamp so that
they might prescribe it for their patients are forced to report
such use to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in sworn and attested
detail, revealing the name and address of the patient, the nature
of his ailment, the dates and amounts prescribed, and so on. If a
physician for any reason fails to do so immediately, both he and
his patient are liable to imprisonment-and a heavy fine.
Obviously, the details of that regulation make it far too risky
for anyone to have anything to do with marijuana in any way
whatsoever. </em></p>

<p><em>Regulations No. 1 was more than an invasion of the
traditional right of privacy between patient and physician; it
was a hopelessly involved set of rules that were obviously
designed not merely to discourage but to prohibit the medical and
popular use of marijuana. In addition to the Marihuana Tax Act
and Regulations No. 1, the Bureau of Narcotics prepared a
standard bill for marihuana that more than forty state
legislatures enacted. This bill made possession and use of
marihuana illegal per se, and so reinforced the federal act. <br>

shall be sold by said collectors shall be fixed by the Secretary
but shall not exceed 2 cents each. Whenever any collector shall
sell any of such forms he shall cause the date of sale, the name
and address of the proposed vendor, the name and address of the
purchaser, and the amount of marihuana ordered to be plainly
written or stamped thereon before delivering the same. </p>

<p>(d) Each such order form sold by a collector shall be prepared
by him and shall include an original and two copies, any one of
which shall be admissible in evidence as an original. The
original and one copy shall be given by the collector to the
purchaser thereof. The original shall in turn be given by the
purchaser thereof to any person who shall, in pursuance thereof,
transfer marihuana to him and shall be preserved by such person
for a period of two years so as to be readily accessible for
inspection by any officer, agent, or employee mentioned in
section 11. The copy given to the purchaser by the collector
shall be retained by the purchaser and preserved for a period of
two years so as to be readily accessible to inspection by any
officer, agent, or employee mentioned in section 11. The second
copy shall be preserved in the records of the collector. <br>
</p>

<p>SEC. 7. (a) There shall be levied, collected, and paid upon
all transfers of marihuana which are required by section 6 to be
carried out in pursuance of written order forms taxes at the
following rates: </p>

<p>(1) Upon each transfer to any person who has paid the special
tax and registered under section 2 of this Act, $1 per ounce of
marihuana or fraction thereof </p>

<p>(2) Upon each transfer to any person who has not paid the
special tax and registered under section 2 of this Act, $100 per
ounce of marihuana or fraction thereof. </p>

<p>(b) Such tax shall be paid by the transferee at the time of
securing each order form and shall be in addition to the price of
such form. Such transferee shall be liable for the tax imposed by
this section but in the event that the transfer is made in
violation of section 6 without an order form and without payment
of the transfer tax imposed by this section, the transferor shall
also be liable for such tax. </p>

<p>(c) Payment of the tax herein provided shall be represented by
appropriate stamps to be provided by the Secretary and said
stamps shall be affixed by the collector or his representative to
the original order form. </p>

<p>(d) All provisions of law relating to the engraving, issuance,
sale, accountability, cancelation, and destruction of tax-paid
stamps provided for in the internal-revenue laws shall, insofar
as applicable and not inconsistent with this Act, be extended and
made to apply to stamps provided for in this section. </p>

<p>(e) All provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in
respect of the taxes imposed by the Act of December 17, 1914 (38
Stat. 785; U. S. C., 1934 ed., title 26, secs. 1040-- 1061,
1383-1391), as amended, shall, insofar as not inconsistent with
this Act, be applicable in respect of the taxes imposed by this
Act. <br>
</p>

<p>SEC. 8. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person who is a
transferee required to pay the transfer tax imposed by section 7
to acquire or otherwise obtain any marihuana without having paid
such tax; and proof that any person shall have had in his
possession any marihuana and shall have failed, after reasonable
notice and demand by the collector, to produce the order form
required by section 6 to be retained by him, shall be presumptive
evidence of guilt under this section and of liability for the tax
imposed by section 7. </p>

<p>(b) No liability shall be imposed by virtue of this section
upon any duly authorized officer of the Treasury Department
engaged in the enforcement of this Act or upon any duly
authorized officer of any State, or Territory, or of any
political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or of
any insular possession of the United States, who shall be engaged
in the enforcement of any law or municipal ordinance dealing with
the production, sale, prescribing, dispensing, dealing in, or
distributing of marihuana. <br>
</p>

<p>SEC. 9. (a) Any marihuana which has been imported,
manufactured, compounded, transferred, or produced in violation
of any of the provisions of this Act shall be subject to seizure
and forfeiture and, except as inconsistent with the provisions of
this Act, all the provisions of internal-revenue laws relating to
searches, seizures, and forfeitures are extended to include
marihuana. </p>

whom seized be confiscated by and forfeited to the United States.
</p>

<p>(c) Any marihuana seized or coming into the possession of the
United States in the enforcement of this Act, the owner or owners
of which are unknown, shall be confiscated by and forfeited to
the United States. </p>

<p>(d) The Secretary is hereby directed to destroy any marihuana

</p>

<p>REGULATIONS <br>
</p>

<p>Introductory <br>
</p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, imposes special (occupational)
taxes upon persons engaging in activities involving articles or
material within the definition of &quot;marihuana&quot; contained
in the act, and also taxes the transfer of such articles or
material. </p>

<p>These regulations deal with details as to tax computation,
procedure, the forms of records and returns, and similar matters.
These matters in some degree are controlled by certain sections
of the United States Revised Statutes and other statutes of
general application. Provisions of these statutes, as well as of
the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 are quoted, in whole or in part, as
the immediate or general basis for the regulatory provisions set
forth. The quoted provisions are from the Marihuana Tax Act of
1937 unless otherwise indicated. </p>

<p>Provisions of the statutes upon which the various articles of
the regulations are based generally have not been repeated in the
articles. Therefore, the statutory excerpts preceding the several
articles should be examined to obtain complete information. <br>

<h1>Conference on Cannabis Sativa L. </h1>

<p><b>January 14, 1937 -- Room 81 Treasury Building, 10:30 AM</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Present: </p>

<p>Dr. Lyster F. Dewey (retired) Department of Agriculture. </p>

<p>Dr. James C. Munch, Professor of Pharmacology, Temple
University </p>

<p>Dr. Herny C. Fuller </p>

<p>Dr. Carl Voegtlin, Chief, Division of Pharmacology, National
Institute of Health </p>

<p>Mr. Arthur F. Sievers, Division of Drug and Related Plants,
Department of Agriculture </p>

<p>Mr. Peter Valaer, Alcohol Tax Unit Washington Laboratory </p>

<p>Dr. John Matchett, Chemist, Bureau of Narcotics </p>

<p>Mr. P. W. Simonds, Alcohol Tax Unit Laboratory </p>

<p>Mr. John F.; Williams, Chief, Division of Laboratories, Bureau
of Customs </p>

<p>Mr. H. J. Wollner, Consulting Chemist to the Secretary of the
Treasury. </p>

<p>M. H. J. Anslinger, Commissioner of Narcotics </p>

<p>Mr. A. L. Tennyson, Legal Division, Bureau of Narcotics </p>

<p>Mr. S. G. Tipton, General Counsel's Office </p>

<p>Mr. R. L. Pierce, General Counsel's Office<br>
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> As I understand the problem we've got
here, and according to Commissioner Anslinger, it is a question
of trying to set up a definition of terms with reference to what
we generically refer to as the marihuana problem, in a
sufficiently clear style and sufficiently competent as to be
significant from an enforcement point of view. Is that as you see
it, Mr. Tennyson? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> And at the same time be mindful of the
legitimate uses of the product. In going through the literature
on marihuana in pursuit of an answer to this general problem of
defining terms, you get very little satisfaction. For every
negative statement made there is a positive one made to
counteract it. One reference will tell you definitely there is no
active principle in the seed -- a dozen will -- and one will cast
a shadow of doubt. Dr. Munch is rather certain there is an active
principle in the seed. I spoke to Dr. Munch in Philadelphia this
week, and put this question to him this way: &quot;Can you take
the position that there is no resin in the male plant?&quot; He
said, &quot;No, because I have found some in the small glands
that secrete the resin so copiously on the leaves of the female
and are found in the male plant, though not to so large an
extent.&quot; Cannabis, in the Uniform Narcotic State Act, is
defined as follows: (reading from the Act) &quot;Cannabis
includes the following substances under whatever names they may
be designated: (a) The dried flowering or fruiting tops of the
pistillate plant Cannabis Sativa L., from which the resin has not
been extracted, (b) the resin extracted from such tops, and (c)
every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or
preparation of such resin, or of such tops from which the resin
has not been extracted.&quot; That obviously doesn't meet our
requirements.<br>
</p>

<p>In an effort to clarify the situation in anticipation of a
possible attempt to set up a more satisfactory legal program, the
technical division in the Treasury, the Narcotics Bureau, and the
Legal Division, have gotten together and asked themselves some
questions, which were distributed. I dare say that a duplicate or
triplicate set of questions might have been asked with equal
effect.<br>
</p>

<p>We haven't a problem akin to the morphine or opium problem. We
knew the chemical reactions of morphine and its behavior before
laws were passed. That state of definitive knowledge does not
obtain with regard to cannabinol, which, again, some people
dispute the existence of. In trying to define these terms we are
not privileged, I am afraid, to be too emphatic about this
compound known as cannabinol, especially since there may be
contributive active ingredients in the plant. It has been an
accepted situation in the past that all trouble derives from the
female plant. That has been thrown over. First of all it was
thought to be only the flowering tops; then, later, the leaves,
but that is questioned at the present time. There isn't very much
we can hang our hats on to. The problem is her of defining this
for purposes of legislation. I wonder whether we can take each of
these questions in turn and discuss them, in an attempt to
clarify the picture somewhat. (Reading first question):
&quot;What is the constituent in Cannabis Sativa which is
definitely know to produce deleterious physiological effects upon
the human body?&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>We, I think, can assume for the moment we refer to those
effects which are recognized as being the concomitant off smoking
the substance. How do you feel about that, Dr. Voegtlin?<br>
</p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> I think we can say that the substance
called cannabinol contains the chief specific pharmacological
principle or principles of the plant.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is that a fact?<br>
</p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> As far as we can tell. Recently a
crystalline substance has been isolated from the oil. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> It is active in that form? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> As far as I know the pharmacological
activity has not been tested. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> We separate cannabinol from the plant and
crystallize it. If we give an animal an injection from that, will
we get the same sort of reaction as it if were smoked? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> The work of Cahn on the crystalline
substance was published in 1932, but apparently it has not been
investigated as to its pharmacological action. Straub has made
partially purified preparations -- not crystalline -- and has
studied their pharmacological action on animals and humans. He
come to the conclusion that the products give essentially the
same response in humans as does the crude drug. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Could we have that reference, Doctor,
again? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Professor Walter Straub, University of
Munich, on &quot;Bavarian Hashisch&quot;. They tested Cannabis
grown locally and found it contained a much mower percentage of
resin -- about one-tenth, if I am right -- as compared with the
Persian product. The crude resin was partially purified. After
calling attention to the lack of reliability of the bio-assay of
Cannabis, they tested their products on rabbits and determined
the dose which was just sufficient to produce anesthesia taken by
human volunteers was found to produce definite symptoms
characteristic of Cannabis. Two doses produced more marked
symptoms. These are described in detail, especially from the
psychiatric standpoint. This is the first careful psychiatric
study of Cannabis. The doses used in terms of weight were very
small. Whether to toxic symptoms were due to one substance or
more than one, it is hard to say. Is it essential to attribute
the action to one definite constituent? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> It would be preferable. We might be able
to exempt certain parts definitely as coming within the purview
of the law. If you can't do that you have to include everything.
What do you think, Mr. Tennyson? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> That's the way I feel. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What do you think, Mr. Anslinger? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> I think so to. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> If it weren't used sometimes in legitimate
industry we wouldn't care. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> May I ask whether you have carried out
any tests here on the presence of active principles in the
different parts of the plant? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Testing say, the leaves, the seeds etc.? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Matchett and Valaer: Have you tried these?
</p>

<p>Negative response. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> </p>

<p>The only one who has done work of that kind is Dr. Munch. He
will be here shortly. His results, working with the seed, showed
two principles, one excitant and one depressive. Of course, the
work has not been confirmed yet. If you accept the possibility of
that, that is what you run into. That is why I asked that
question. Is it possible that you have here the same situation as
in opium, where you have a series of bi-alkaloids? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Just to clarify the situation, I would
like to ask, from the standpoint of the layman, the difference
between cannabin, cannabinol, and resin? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Voegtlin, can you clarify that point? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> The resin is the crude secretion
expressed from the plant. Cannabinol is a partially purified
preparation of the resin. Resin and cannabinol are usually
considered as containing the specific principles of Cannabis. As
I said before, Cahn has applied the name Cannabinol to his
crystalline substance, but this has not as yet been shown to be
physiologically active. The word Cannabin is loosely used by
different authors for impure products obtained from the resin. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Is the drug principle only from the
resin? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Williams:</b> I believe Cannaben is the name applied to
the alkaloid. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Isn't it true, that on the nether side of
the leaves there are long hairs among which are sacs which
secrete this resin analogous to opium? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Can that be obtained from the seed or the
stalk? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> That is the question. It can be obtained
from the flowering tops like opium. Can we define it as coming
from the leaves and the flowering tops, when later we may find it
comes also from the seeds and the stalk? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Can you identify it? If a substance
contains cannabinol, can you by some process tell it is there? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> If it is present in certain quantities and
in a certain state. That to a layman is no answer at all. If it
exists in the form Dr. Voegtlin has mentioned, we can identify it
if tit is there in sensible quantities. We do not know whether we
can identify it if it were in a form generically on either side
of it. We do not know what it is converted into if it stays in
the open. Specifically, from your point of view, we do not know
whether if you dehydrated the flowering tops for two years you
could reactivate it. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> As I understand it, Dr. Voegtlin, the
resin is not designated as cannabinol. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Cannabinol is an extract made from the
resin. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> The point is, we could not start with
cannabinol as the fundamental of this drug for purposes of
legislation, could we? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> No, you could not. </p>

<p>Mr. Valaer: I would like to make a practical suggestion. In
growing the two kinds, male and female plants, in my back yard, I
extracted a green resin from both plants. It looked exactly
alike. There was not enough material to make fine extractions fur
they appeared to be the same. There are more leaves on the female
plant. In the male, there is hardly anything to really make a
cigarette out of, but those leaves had the same sort of green
resin that was described by various authors as being found in the
female plant. Whether the physiological characteristics might be
different or not, I do not know, but they certainly look the same
and both gave the same Beam reaction. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> To confirm your work, Dr. Munch has done a
microscopic examination of the male plant and found exactly the
same sacs there as in the female, though many less of them. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> As a matter of fact the cannabis from Indian
seed grown in this country 35 or 40 years ago produced a plant
with both male and female flowers on the same plant. That's not
uncommon with plants taken out of their ordinary habitat. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> The seeds in my little investigation were
furnished by Dr. Dewey, and it seemed there were as many male as
female seeds. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> You never can tell by the seeds which they
are. They range from 60 percent to 40 percent always. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Did the male plant mature earlier than
the female? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> Yes. I brought specimens of both kinds
over. The male plant was dry while the female plant was still
green and pliable. Some of the green pollen formed early in the
male plant, and in order to get some seeds with it I shook some
onto the female plants. Evidently I did fertilize them, because
this is the third year, and I had volunteers this spring. It was
three years ago I made the test, and last year and this year they
showed up again. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Do you see what we are up against, Mr.
Tennyson? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Yes. I would like to ask Dr. Dewey a
question if I may, to bring out the possibility off varieties in
this plant. A question has been raised as to the difference
between Cannabis Americana and Cannabis Indica. My impression,
according to past talks over the telephone with Dr. Dewey, was
that they are all the same. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Three are many forms or types which are
quite different, but the differences are only in degree. There
are no distinct differences permitting a specific description I
brought an illustration of the plants as they grow. There is the
Cannabis Indica described by La Marsh in 1788, and in 1901; if he
had my own plants he could not have made a more accurate
description. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What can we be sure of? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> The danger in a definition would be to
describe one species like Indian hemp or Cannabis Sativa L. or
Cannabis Indica. We've got to be all-inclusive. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is there a generic title? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> There is only one species, but different
forms. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What would be the term under which we
would be certain of including all forms? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Cannabis Sativa L. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Sievers: </b>Unless you want to say Cannabis Sativa and
all varieties, if that would help any. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> We discovered a field in Massachusetts,
which has a law prohibiting the raising of Indian hemp, and the
man said he was raising Cannabis Americana. It raised a nice
question and might have availed him something in court if there
is any distinction between Indian hemp and American. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> This is a basis we can all agree upon,
then, that the designation be Cannabis Sativa L. That would
include the plant in any stage off growth or development from the
seed onward. Or would we have to further define that, Dr. Dewey? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> I don't think so. Cannabis will cover the
plant in all forms. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is there any question as to identification
of the seed? Suppose the possession of the seed were proscribed
by law and a man were found with a parcel of it. Is there any
possibility of error? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> I don't think so. The seed is very
characteristic. there are varieties in size ranging from 50 to
75% in different forms. I don't know of any seed that can be
mistaken for it though. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Would we have to actually plant the seed
and see what happens to definitely establish that this is the
seed? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> I would like to quote Dr. George L. Keenan:
&quot;The most characteristic seed that I have ever examined is
the cannabis seed.&quot; It is the easiest part of the plant to
identify. I don't believe that difficulty will ever come up. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Have you had any experience, Mr. Tennyson?
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Not in seed. From what I can learn from
Mr. Valaer and Mr. Simonds, it occurred to us that some one might
take this abstract and impregnate tobacco, and we wonder whether
it would be possible to identify that? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I think that is an enforcement problem
which would have to be predicated on present methods of
identification and what can be developed. My thought was to first
define the subject we are dealing with. Let's agree on the
terminology with reference to this plant marihuana, Cannabis
Indica, or Cannabis American. There seems to be no question that
if we call it Cannabis Sativa we include all forms of the plant.
The question is this: Can the plant in any of its forms be
mistaken for any other plant? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> I don't know of any other plant. The leaf is
very characteristic. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Sievers, how do you feel? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Sievers: </b>I want to confirm what Mr. Valaer said; it
is very easy to identify and there is no other seed known that
could be mistaken for it. Some of the nettles come the closest, I
believe. As to the character of the seed, Mr. Keenan told me just
the other day that there was no other seed known that would be
mistaken for it. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Munch, we are at the present time on
the question of defining terms in reference to this problem. We
have reached the point where all of us agree that if we refer to
this species as Cannabis Sativa L. we refer to it in all stages
of growth and development, and all the related members of the
same family. The question has come up as to whether there is any
possibility of confounding the seeds or the leaves separated from
the stalks, or the flowering tops of any of the plants
generically listed under this title, with any other type of
plant. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> In our experience, as far as the microscopic
examination goes, we think we can distinguish Cannabis Sativa
from any other plant that has been submitted. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What is the reason for the doubt implied
by your statement? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> We have only examined about fifty different
species of plants. There might be something we don't know about.
Thus far, we have not had any difficulty in distinguishing
Cannabis. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Regardless of the state of dehydration? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Regardless. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is that purely visual, or is a chemical
test included? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Only microscopic tests have been conducted
in detail. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> In aging the plant, is there any
likelihood of what you refer to as the source of the resin being
destroyed or in any way hidden or assimilated in the body of the
leaf in such a manner you could not recognize it? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> I would have to qualify my answer to that. I
haven't examined material less than three or four months old, and
the literature states that these glandular cells do not appear
until the plant is at least two months old. Under a variety of
conditions, our microscopic examinations have always shown the
presence of the typical glandular cells. The microscope seems to
work under all conditions. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Could we add to our definition that,
regardless of the state of the plant, we could always identify
any portion as belonging to this family? I was just wondering
whether we could back up anything we could say. Could we do
anything to the plant which would prevent us from identifying it?
Let's say it had the age of about one year. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> You are thinking about the leaf of the
plant? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> I think we can answer that in the
affirmative. I think that under ordinary conceivable conditions
we could identify it. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Voegtlin, how do you react? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> I'm not a botanist. Suppose you only had
fragments or leaves or seeds, could you identify them? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> You could microscopically. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> That's right. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> At one time I had to examine a cigarette
which was a mixture of tobacco and marijuana. It did not seem
difficult at all to distinguish between ordinary tobacco
structure and the other. It was a coarse yellow structure. It was
just like picking out a pea from a bean, almost, under the
microscope. In this first experience it seemed a very simple
matter. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> There are other characteristics of the
leaves besides the glands. I was looking at the pictorial
microscopic fragments of Karma yesterday, and there are twenty
things that might be concerned in distinguishing them. Cannabis
is easy in one way, because there is only one species for the
whole family. No other plant answers that description. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> It was the oldest plant described -- at
least 2700 BC. That description has come down without question to
the present time. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> They have references of its use in India
for the purposes we are discussing. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is there any part of the plant we can
exempt from any official cognizance? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Sievers: </b>I could suggest something, but in view of
Dr. Munich's work I am not so sure. It was always my
understanding that the mature seed was harmless, but I would like
to hear what Dr. Munch says. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Would you mind telling us, Dr. Munch, what
your recent experience has been? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> I would be very glad to. We became
interested in connection with the study of the possibility of
developing biochemical methods for detecting materials in the
saliva of animals, particularly men and horses. We studied two
lots of hemp seed bought from feed stores, and a third lot which
I separate by have from Cannabis Sativa plants grown under my
personal observation in Glenolden, Pennsylvania. All three lots
behaved in the same way. Ether removed the fat. Alcohol extracts
of the de-fatted material had either a depressive or stimulating
effect on mice, cats, dogs, and horses. We went a step further
and added norite to the alcohol solution. After norite treatment
the solution was lighter in color and contained the principle
giving the stimulating reaction. We next eluted with chloroform,
which gave us a cheesy-like material soluble in alcohol, and
producing only a depressant effect. When we took extracts of
commercial material (consisting of the leaves and fruit) and
tried them on our mice they showed either a depressive or
stimulating reaction; when we carefully removed all the fruits,
then the extracts of the leaves had a depressant effect only. Our
suggestion is that the stimulating principle of the fruit may go
in with the depressant of the leaves and the resultant extract
may show either stimulating or depressing effects, or nothing. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Did you try it on dogs? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> There was no ataxia? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> No. The extracts of the fruit do not produce
ataxia. In fact, they do not produce a typical cannabis reaction.
</p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> I think the depressing effect would be
similar to that of the barbiturates. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> In terms of seed used, what is the dose
as compared with the flowering tops? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> For the depressive type of effect? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Approximately ten times as large as the
leaves, on mice. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Matchett:</b> Isn't it true that the extract from the
leaves would be different from cannabinol in this case? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> We did not do any chemical work, but I
expect they would differ. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> It would appear there are at least three
principles we have to deal with. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> There is this to be said. We know that the
principle won't stand rigorous treatment. Is it definitely known
that cannabis does the job? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> I evade answering that by saying I have
never seen cannabinol. I have attempted to duplicate some of the
work reported in the literature, but have not gotten satisfactory
results. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Wollner:</b> I would like to see reference to this:
where a man has taken cannabinol, purified it and found it to be
active. Did Fraenkel do any tests? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Yes. His work was with a certain product
&quot;Cannabinol&quot; -- an oil -- which he found to be active.
The work of Straub and the more recent chemical work of Cahn and
Casparis shows that his suggested chemical constitution was not
right. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> The doses Straub used were small, getting
powerful effects in man, which would indicate that he dealt with
a highly potent material. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Fuller, I think you have something to
say. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> I think I can add one or two points, from
the experimental work I did covering about four years, some time
ago, working with the plant on a rather extensive scale. We grew
it by the acre -- fifteen or twenty acres at a time -- and
concentrated on the bushy plant and from seed selection we got
plants that would not grow over eight feet tall but were very
bushy. That is, in the female. The male is more scraggly. </p>

<p>In the work I was doing we attempted to root up the male
plants as fast as the blossoms became apparent so there would be
no fertilization. I think, in planting as we used to, ten to a
hill, we never get less than eight plants to come up and until
the reached a certain stage we could not tell them apart. Some of
these groups --- I don't know whether it is atmospheric
conditions, soil conditions, or what -- seemed to develop more
resin than others. One year we might get tops and leaves very
sticky, and again they did not seem to be so much so. </p>

<p>After it is harvested and dried all you have to do is cut and
shuck it like corn. There are always a certain number of seeds
that will remain on the tops, especially where the plants are
quite resinous. </p>

<p>Whether they can be gotten off by some process not known to
the seed men I don't know, but it appears to me that the effect
Dr. Munch has described probably came from a lack of thoroughness
in removing that last portion of the resin, rather than any
inherent substance in the interior of the seed itself. I am not
saying that is the case, and don't want to cast any doubt on Dr.
Munch's work, but am giving it as a suggestion. The plants I
worked with were carried down to as ultimate a point as possible
in the experiments that were conducted . This was done during the
war. We were working with Dr. Sievers' office and trying to
develop a drug industry. I found it was a very simple matter to
concentrate the active principle, and I believe there is more
than one as we got more than one effect-- depression,
uncoordination, and a narcosis on dogs. </p>

<p>The experiment I carried out was done with an extract from the
leaf and the seed and tops down to a point where we had a very
sticky deep green extract, soluble in petroleum either and that,
in turn, was treated with alkali which removed a great deal of
resinous material which I assumed was inert and, carrying down
further, we found this oily residue which was extremely active.
The fact that the product had been obtained using a strong
alkali, say 10 percent, would indicate to me that this substance
cannabinol is not very phenolic in character. If it had been, it
was my opinion it would have stayed in the alkali and not gone
into the petroleum either. All this petroleum either extract was
extremely active, and I was very anxious to go on with that to
see if I could not get out some things to which activity could be
actually ascribed, but, unfortunately, the people backing the
work died and my experiments ended at that point. The points I
want to make are these: </p>

<p>You will get drugs, cannabis, off probable different strength,
depending on the season, and the development of this resinous
matter. It is possible that what we consider as an active
principle in the seeds is due to the adherent resinous matter
which is difficult to abrade. I believe nobody knows definitely
what, in a chemical way, the active principle of cannabis is, and
I am almost of the opinion that there is more than one. I worked
with the leaves from the male tops before being dried, and they
are active, containing some resin. There is an active constituent
there, and there is no reason why, if anybody wanted to raise a
crop of cannabis they could not gather the male tops for that
purpose. The female contains more because of the bunchy
conditions of the tops. In other words, I believe both plants
contain active material but, of course, the female is the more
lucrative source. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> This confirms a lot you have said, Dr.
Munch. You confirmed that fact with the male plant. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Yes. Exception is taken to only one point of
Dr. Fuller's discussion. I set my hard-working assistants to work
picking off the shells, and we still got both the reactions from
the decorticated plants. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Mr. Anslinger, I think that answers some
doubts in your mind as to the Uniform State Act. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Yes. At this point, with regard to what
Dr. Fuller had to say about several constituents, I think we
might consider the experiments made by the Medical Division of
the War Department in Panama. They took ten or twenty soldiers,
gave them cigarettes to smoke and observed them over a given
period. It seems every man got a different reaction. Some were
depressed, some stimulated, some morose, some hysterical, some
slept, and some became wild. It bears out what Dr. Fuller had to
say about the possibility of there being a number of active
principles. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> I don't know whether that necessarily
follows. The way I understand the action of cannabis is that it
does away with cerebral inhibitions. Now, that might produce any
sort of reaction, according to the individual who is exposed to
the drug. I think that's the reason we get these different
manifestations. For instance, in this paper, (referring to
Bavaran Haschish by Straub.) scientific people would have a very
keen perception of their scientific problems, but they did not
develop mania as some people do. It s the psychological
constitution of the individual which determines the response. I
agree there is a good chance we are dealing with different
principles, though this has not be proven or disproven. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Wollner:</b> I think I am inclined to agree with Dr.
Voegtlin. The thing has not been sufficiently investigated to say
definitely that there is only one or that there is more than one.
From the legal point of view we cannot tie up any legislation
with the term cannabinol. I am afraid that has to be out until we
know more, and that may take thirty or forty years. There is a
concomitant to that, since we do not know the active ingredient
or ingredients, we are not in a position to say one chemical
treatment or another might not produce those active ingredients
from that portion of the plant which at the present time is
believed to be totally innocuous. We might be able to take the
stalk which is today a harmless part of the plant and generate it
from copious quantities of the active ingredient. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> That bears directly on the discussion we
had on limiting this for the purpose of a workable piece of
legislation to flowering tops, seeds, and leaves of the plant.
Our idea was to attempt to help the hemp industry if we could do
it. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> We might, among ourselves, compromise the
situation. That situation must be acknowledged in the same way
you have to accept the fact that morphine can be extracted from
the stalk of the opium plant. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> We might be in a bad position if we
eliminated the stalks and later found it to be present in them. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> My experience with it was that the active
principle was tied up in the resin -- whether this was gathered
up and held there mechanically and did not exist in the more
cellular portions of the plant I do not know. That was my only
experience. I made no tests on the stems. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> We could make those tests, couldn't we? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I wonder whether our botanist friends
could help us? What is the history of plants of this type? Are we
likely to have them behaving as morphine and present in all parts
of the plants? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> I can tell you our experience with
belladonna, which is easily identified. The succulent parts, that
is, the leaves toward the ends of the lateral stems and tops were
always the most potent. We grew some that were over 2 percent
alkaloid. As you come down to the big leaves which grew to
maturity early and were beginning to disappear, there was very
little alkaloid. The main stem and lateral stems that were woody
were devoid of alkaloid. Toward the ends -- in the top stems --
we got alkaloid. Where they were more or less woody there was
none. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Wouldn't that be predicated on the
sensitivity of your tests? Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume
that at any one time you would find it in the pipe lines? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> Yes, the pipe lines contained it all the
way through as long as they were succulent. The root as well as
the leaves of the belladonna contains the alkaloid. The woody
stem did not contain it. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Sievers: </b>The resin is probably parallel to
essential oils which are present in leaves or flowers more than
in the woody part. The stems as a rules contain a great deal
less. Occasionally you will find it in the root. I hardly think
the seed would contain much resin and at this time I would like
to be put clear on what Dr. Munch has developed -- whether he
really thinks the seed will produce any effects as the resin
does. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> The active material from the fruits does not
produce the same type of pharmacological response as the active
material from the leaves. We have instances recorded in the
literature of narcotic effects on children from the fruits. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> When you speak of fruits, do you include
seed? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Technically this is a fruit and not seed. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> The words are more or less synonymous in
the way they are used. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> There is a case on record, I believe, of
a prisoner who had a canary bird in the cell and the warden found
he was taking the seed brought in to the bird. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> May I offer for the record several lines of
French? In a publication by Dardanane, on page 20, he is
referring to some work done by Bouquet. The essence of it is that
physiological tests upon the twigs of Indian hemp showed 0.40
percent, whereas the inflorescences showed 7.20 percent of resin.
</p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> That sounds to me as if it was an immature
plant. </p>

<p>Mr. Anslinger. Bouquet is working on this now. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> It says the young shoots here showed a very
high percentage in comparison with the old shoots. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Sievers:</b> The old stems would still contain less. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> It occurs to me, Dr. Wollner, that if we
get a law we have to support it and everything in it when we go
before the committee. We have here some other uses -- I don't
know whether I am anticipating one of these questions or not.
There is a use for fiber, for bird-seed, and for oil in the
varnish industry. Those people will probably come in and complain
about what they consider a foolish attempted control if we try to
make this all-inclusive. If we are going to cast suspicion on
every part of the plant we certainly will have to be fortified. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I would offer this question to that,
although we think it is well taken. It does not follow that
because the seeds or the stalks are potential sources that we
wish legislation to control their use. I do feel that we should
be in a position to know what the situation is. I think that
would be a preferred position to be in -- to be able to say that
there is a possibility, but if it is existing, it is in amounts
not sufficient to warrant its inclusion. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> We had a complaint from the
Sherwin-Williams Company who wanted to start a farm. We tried to
discourage that. The point was raised in connection with this
tentative act we have drafted. We are faced, on account of
constitutional limitations, with the necessity of drafting this
as a tax measure, with lessening of application of the tax to the
legitimate articles of commerce which are innocent. In that phase
of the situation we have quite a problem to qualify the
exemptions, say seed, where there is apparently such a use for
it. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> One thing would help us a great deal. It
would be relatively simple, I imagine, to delete certain portions
of the plant if we could say how much of the active principle was
available in those parts of the plant. I turn to Dr. Voegtlin on
this. Is it possible to use a bio-assay? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> No, I don't think it is characteristic
enough. We are interested in the psychic manifestations which are
produce by this product. These are, of course, not recognized in
dogs or rabbits. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Dr. Voegtlin, you mentioned that article
by Straub in which he created this active principle in terms of
the corneal effect. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> The criticism of the bio-assay on dogs
holds also for the bio-assay on rabbits. both methods are based
on the degree of cerebral depression produced. The symptoms in
dogs and rabbits are not specific for cannabis, but occur also
after alcohol and other drugs having a similar pharmacological
action. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Cannabis Sativa is included in the U.S.
Pharmacopoeia in unit doses? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> How are they measured? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> By the bio-assay method. I was a member
of the Standardization Committee of the League of Nations and
that is one thing we discussed and we came to the conclusion it
was not reliable. Most pharmacopoeias do not contain a bio-assay
for cannabis, although the American one does. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> If I may intrude, that bio-assay was in the
10th, but is not in the 11th edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia.
When the American Drug Manufacturers Association submitted
samples they obtained such inconsistent results that the
bio-assay was deleted from U.S.P. XI. Qualitatively, the
procedure was all right. We found, in our dog tests, that only
about one dog in a hundred had a sufficiently developed brain to
be useful. I made a detailed study of the rabbits corneal
anesthesia method. We were unable to obtain any quantitative
results with fluid extract. We do think it is qualitatively
valuable. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Could you answer this question: Has an
active principle ever been separated from Cannabis Sativa, which
was not associated with cannabinol? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> If, by cannabinol, you refer to a particular
product mentioned in the literature by Fraenkel, then I can
answer the question. I believe that if the material reported by
Fraenkel is considered as an entity, there may be another
constituent in the leaf of Cannabis. Subsequent work has not
confirmed the original cannabinol, and there are possibly three
or four active principles at the present time, depending on the
author. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> We are after limiting specifications. It
is not necessary that the active principle be cannabinol or that
it be the one and only, but if we could definitely establish that
the active principle has been found then we could say &quot;a
substance which contains less than a certain amount of cannabinol
is exempt.&quot; Do you see what I mean? How do you feel,
Commissioner? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> I would like to ask Dr. Munch a
question. I thought you had found one other principle? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> I believe there are at least three active
principles. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What would the legal aspect of this be,
Mr. Tennyson? Would it be legally sound to measure the activity
of the product by the amount of a material which is present and
always associated with the material? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> This is a taxing measure, you know. We
like to think of it as some standard definite term that can be
referred to that everybody knows about. If you are going to tax
something on the basis of its strength, you have a lot of
trouble. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> You tax liquors by nature of their content
and material. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Wouldn't that place a colossal burden on
your division, Dr. Wollner, when we get these cases into court? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I think the Beams reaction would give
evidence of cannabinol. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> If the Commissioner finds a field of
fifteen acres growing will it be necessary to test ever plant to
determine that, or can you, when you have tested one strain, say
the rest of the field is the same? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> That would not be necessary, would it? If
you find a man with one hundred heroin pills it is not necessary
to test the hundred. We are trying to exempt the usable parts of
the plant. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> At the present time the chemist has an easy
time identifying. I would rather see us go further and say,
identify a green resin which is apparently in both male and
female plants. If you have to find a definite crystalline
substance it is going to put a burden on the chemist. I believe
we are going far enough to keep within practical grounds. If it
is not a definite structure we could say it is a green resin. We
have been very successful in court. I don't know of any case
where anybody has fallen down. If we go too far I am afraid we
are going to get into trouble. On this data here of the League of
Nations on which some of the best minds in Europe have expressed
themselves one man calls Cannabis one thing and one another
thing. They all agree that there is a crude green substance. If
you want to get into effect within the next year or so, if we get
as far as a green resin characteristic of the plant, we will
accomplish something. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> I am afraid of making it too
complicated. The agents out in the sticks would be confused. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What's wrong with Mr. Valaer's approach? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> That would make the question easier
constitutionally to defend I think, than if you were to link it
with some constituent part. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Suppose Dr. Matchett, as a result of his
investigations in the laboratory, finds he is able to recover a
certain amount of this green resin from the stalks, what is
Commissioner Anslinger supposed to do then? For the purpose of
this act could we define the substance first as a resin,
secondly, as the leaves of the male and female plant, third, as
the tops of the plants? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> Would that include bird seed? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> No. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> If Sherwin-Williams wants to put in an
acreage then they could do it. </p>

<p>Mr. Fuller: They can winnow the seeds out of the flowering
tops. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> The reason I am after the seed is the
preventive measure. Getting the seed out will make our trouble
disappear. </p>

<p>Mr. Sievers: Isn't that the same situation you have with
regard to poppy? You can grow them in this country for seed
legally, can't you? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> What you say is probably true, but we
like to discourage that as far as possible. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Sievers: </b>There is no law at present that would
prohibit me from growing poppy as a seed poppy. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> In every case I know of where it was
done we got the defendant. </p>

<p>Mr. Sievers: We had a project years ago where the scheme was
to grow the poppy and let it mature and have the seed as a side
crop, and we extracted morphine and other products. We did not go
far with it because the Secretary did not approve. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> Can't you have some provision in your
legislation for destroying the seed after the oil has been taken
out? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> I would like to pursue this definition
further. That sounds pretty good if you can define this greenish
substance. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I don't know whether it would be necessary
to define it beyond stating its generic state: &quot;The resin
which is derived from this plant.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> Given a batch of greenish resin, you can
determine that? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Yes, I think that can be done. That is a
question of laboratory technique. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> Can you say that the active principle is in
the resin? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Yes, we can definitely say that the active
principle is in the resin. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> Your suggested definition is the flowering
tops, the leaves, and the greenish resin? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> But that doesn't satisfy Commission
Anslinger because potentially every seed is harmful. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Our experience has been that in almost
every large seizure made we got a large quantity of the seed from
the defendant for growing purposes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What would happen if we proscribed the use
of seed for bird seed? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Dr. Munch told me it would stop the
birds from singing. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> The difficulty in Philadelphia now may be
illustrated by one of these photographs. The individuals
testified that this crop had been grown from bird seed scattered
on the ground. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> If we proscribe the use of this stuff as
bird seed we could eliminate that. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> Does ordinary commercial bird seed have any
particular effect on its use? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Bird seed only in part contains the
Cannabis Sativa seed. I do not think our state of knowledge on
that is sufficient. Not enough work has been done to say that it
is detrimental tot the birds. The idea would be to license the
growing of this stuff and to rule out the use of it for bird
seed. If anybody else had it after that they would be guilty of a
violation. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> The tentative idea was to place a
transfer tax on whatever we should cover, for instance,
marihuana, or a general term which would be recognized -- a
moderate tax for recognized purposes and a prohibitive transfer
tax for any other purpose. What was the first amount? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> $1.00 to register. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> The use of hemp seed for bird seed costs
about $1.00 per hundred pounds. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I don't see that it would present any
difficulties from the point of view of our technical side to
include all the parts of the plants we know to contribute to the
drug. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce: </b>We have excluded transfers to certain
users. We would like to know if it would be safe to exclude
transfers to persons just selling bird seed and who do not plant
tit? Can any ill effect come from this? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Suppose a man said he just discarded some
bird seed and threw it out his window? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> If it is growing he is liable for the tax. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Suppose he plants it on someone else's
property? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Practically all of our wild hemp is from
bird seed. I don't know of a single instance in America where the
fiber type has become wildly grown. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> Is hemp seed indispensable from bird seed?
If Commissioner Anslinger would agree to cut out bird seed it
would certainly help the bill and enforcement. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> Can they prove that the birds need this
food? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Matchett:</b> Two people told me the hemp seed had
potentialities for evil for the bird if the husks were not
removed; furthermore, that the seed is an oily seed and is
dangerous especially if the oil is rancid. I gathered that the
hemp would not be indispensable, but did not ask it directly. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Can we start setting up a definition for
the purposes of the legal division? We include in that the resin
derived from the plant Cannabis Sativa. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> Would you want to include the solid extract
too? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Any extract or derivative thereof. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> You would not need to do that. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> In other words, the usual terminology
would obtain with reference to this. Can't we get away from the
use of the term marihuana? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> We just happened to mention it as a
general term. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I think we would be on sounder ground if
we left t in the scientific name Cannabis Sativa Linne. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> In a statute you can pick a term and define
it as you please. Marihuana struck us as a good short form. Its
meaning in any other regard would be of no consequence. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> But don't you think, in order to be a
little more scientific, we might call it Cannabis? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> Certain state laws prohibit the use of
marihuana. If your Federal law defines marihuana, will that
strengthen your state laws? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> One of the purpose of the conference is
to give the States a better definition. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> We can say that Cannabis Sativa means
Cannabis Sativa Linne. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> Isn't there some advantage in using the
popular term marihuana? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> It is technically unsound and wrong, but
that's up to you men to decide. Whatever you call it, it means
Cannabis Sativa L, and any preparations, derivatives, etc. --
what else should there be? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> &quot;The salts, derivatives and
preparations&quot; or &quot;any resin, salt, derivative and
preparation thereof.&quot; Do you want to give that? Marihuana
means Cannabis Sativa L. and any resin, compound, mixture, salt,
preparation, etc.&quot; Would that mean everything? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Cannabis means the flowering tops, the
leaves and any resin, compound, mixture, salt, derivative or
preparation of the plant Cannabis Sativa L. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> That will include the fiber, won't it? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> We can exclude the fiber. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> In the Mexican Pharmacopoeia it says that
marihuana refers to the feminine inflorescence of Cannabis
Sativa. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Can we deliberately exempt the stalks? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> I think it would be better to say
&quot;Marihuana is the resin, and the flowering tops and leaves
of the plant Cannabis Sativa L., the preparations, etc.&quot;
That will eliminate the stalks yet include the resin. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Is the &quot;flowering top&quot;
sufficient to include the seed. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> It is not quite specific: </p>

<p><b>Mr. Valaer:</b> Let me give you a rough idea of what I have
in mind. For the purposes of this act marihuana shall include all
of the species of Cannabis Sativa Lynne, Noraceae and its
synonyms: Cannabis eradica paludosa endrs; Cannabis indica
Lamarck; Cannabis macoosperma stokes; Cannabis chinensis, delile;
Cannabis giganta, delile; and by all other designations known.
The provisions of this act shall pertain to all parts of the
pistillate (female plant) and all parts of the staminate (male
plant) and all parts that have been found to secrete the
characteristic resin of Cannabis Sativa L. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> That throws it wide open again. We would
have you out in the field looking for secretions. I don't think
you give us enough leeway for exempting the stalks. The
suggestion of Mr. Tipton fortifies us in this respect. The stalks
as such cannot be smoked. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Matchett:</b> Could it be possible that the young
plants might have the resin in their stalks? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> Put in the word mature. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> I think that's a good point. The only
thing you want to exclude are the mature stalks. I don't see any
reason why that should not be done. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> I can't think of any. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Would you be authorized to issue specific
regulations interpreting this? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> You have to be pretty definite in your act.
</p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Would you be undertaking too much if you
exempted the oil? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> In ou transfer tax we could make exceptions
for the paint companies. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> If you are going to take care of these
things in your transfer tax why not take care of your stalk there
too? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> We could. We are attempting to thrust the
marihuana traffic into legal channels where it could be taxed
some. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> What is that predicated on? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Physical transfer: </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Suppose I grew the stuff myself. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> You are taxed as a producer. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Would the tax on that be prohibitive? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> No, by paying $25.00 I think you can grow
and smoke all the marihuana you like, yourself. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Is it incumbent upon you to see that no
one else smokes it? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> There is a transfer tax which is
prohibitive, and, of course, criminal penalties. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> And the responsibility rests on the
enforcement officer to show that there was a transfer? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Mr. Pierce, would you try to re-word that
definition? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> How would it be if you let us work out the
definition. We have pretty well in mind what you wish to have
exempted. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Commissioner Anslinger, have you any
suggestions? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> No, I think that's going to be a great
improvement over the definition we started with. I wanted to show
the extent of the traffic and give some of the gentleman an idea
of this problem to show we are not on a fishing expedition. Last
year there were 296 seizures we know about. The illicit traffic
has shown up in almost every state. </p>

<p>There was a question about the forms of Cannabis derivatives
employed medicinally. This will take care of that trade, won't
it? Is the tax to be prohibitive as to the trade? We prepared for
the legal division a statement as to what was used. We had a list
of about three hundred compounds. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> We have allowed exemptions in another part
of the law for medical or veterinary uses. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Even that's going to be awfully
expensive, <b>Mr. Pierce:</b> </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> I was surprised to hear some medical
experts at Geneva recently say that is has absolutely no medical
use. I think that the Indian delegate wanted to know what he was
going to do for his corn plaster, and one of the medicos said it
wasn't the cannabis, but something else, that had the analgesic
effect. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Munch:</b> We have shown that Cannabis has no local
analgesic effect. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> (Reading the 14th question.) &quot;What
are the proofs that the use of marihuana in any of its forms, are
habit-forming or addicted, and what are the indications and
positive proofs that such addiction develops socially undesirable
characteristics in the user?&quot; We have a lot of cases showing
that it certainly develops undesirable characteristics. We have a
case of a boy, about 15, (reads from report of case). This took
place in a community playground in Finely, Ohio. The playground
supervisors were the men who were selling the stuff. It all
developed from the case of this youngster who was evidently going
crazy. That's only one of the many cases we have. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> Have you a lot of cases on this--horror
stories -- that's what we want. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Isn't there some literature on the
effects, Dr. Voegtlin? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> Oh, yes. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Anslinger:</b> And it leads to insanity? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Voegtlin:</b> I think it is an established fact that
prolonged use leads to insanity in certain cases, depending upon
the amount taken, of course. Many people take it and do not go
insane, but many do. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> At the League of Nations they whitewashed
the whole thing. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Colonel Crane wrote me it did cause trouble
over there. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> the Commission inquired into the fact and
said there was no more reason to control the hashish than to
control alcohol. If it leads to insanity, and we have a lot of
horror stories, we can build it up. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> There was a report given out by Wilbert in
1910 in which he claimed, as one of his conclusions, that there
was no evidence of a habit-forming nature from the use of
Cannabis by the Anglo-Saxon race. I just mention that because it
may be pulled on you in opposition some time. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Dewey:</b> Dr. Patrick, of the Bureau of Chemistry,
definitely stated it was the most dangerous habit-forming drug he
had taken, and he tried all of them. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Are there any other questions? </p>

<p>Mr. Sievers: I would like to ask what the situation is with
regard to the seed. What about a person who wants to import the
seed for bird seed or hemp oil? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> That's something still to be determined
when we consider this new definition. I am not quite sure myself
just how that will be handled. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> The only thing I had in mind was that we
would endeavor, by the use of exemptions, to protect the use for
oil-producing hemp, and to discourage the use of bird seed,
because bird seed, as the Commissioner remarks, results to a
great extent in illicit usage. </p>

<p>Mr. Seivers: Will there be a tax on the seed when used for oil
purposes? </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tipton:</b> The transfer tax will be exempted there. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Pierce:</b> I think we can work out the tax on
medicinal uses so that it won't be prohibitive. The bird seed
industry will be wiped out probably as far as hemp seed is
concerned. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Dr. Munch, you are quite familiar with
Sharpe &amp; Dohme's method of manufacture, aren't you? I was
thinking that this transfer tax would have to be appreciable at
least, and if it were at the rate of $1.00 an ounce on the raw
material and another dollar an ounce on the transfer of extract,
it would be rather expensive. </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> I think you will find that, while a great
many preparations may use a small quantity, there won't be a
great deal of it used medicinally. Bauer and Black, in Chicago,
used a great deal in making a plaster at one time. the rest of it
might use a few pounds a year and, perhaps, somebody making corn
plaster would use some. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Tennyson:</b> Veterinarians use a great deal, don't
they? </p>

<p><b>Dr. Fuller:</b> I don't think you will find the volume is
very great. I think the ue of Cannabis is diminishing as a
legitimate use. that is just my opinion. from the point of view
of one who has studied the situation for a good many years. </p>

<p><b>Mr. Wollner:</b> Gentlemen, I want to thank Dr. Fuller, Dr.
Dewey, Dr. Veogtlin, Mr. Sievers, and Dr. Munch for their very
kind assistance. I wonder if you gentlemen would be in a position
to confer with us further after this have been given more
consideration? <br>

<p>TAXATION OF MARIHUANA </p>

<p>HEARINGS BEFORE THE </p>

<p>COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS </p>

<p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p>

<p>SEVENTY-FIFTH CONGRESS </p>

<p>FIRST SESSION ON H.R. 6385 </p>

<p>APRIL 27, 28, 29, 30, AND MAY 4, 1937 </p>

<p>STATEMENT OF CLINTON M. HESTER, ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL FOR
THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY; AND S.G TIPTON, OFFICE OF GENERAL
COUNSEL </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman and members of the Ways and Means
Committee, for the past two years the Treasury Department has
been making a study of the subject of marihuana, a drug which is
found in the flowering tops, seeds, and leaves of Indian hemp and
is now being used extensively by high-school children in
cigarettes. Its effect is deadly. </p>

<p>I would like to say at this point that we have with us this
morning Commissioner Anslinger, of the Bureau of Narcotics, who
has had charge of the enforcement of the Harrison Narcotics Act,
and who will have charge of the enforcement of this act, if this
bill is enacted into law. We also have with use a pharmacologist
who is prepared to testify as to the effect of the drug on human
beings. We also have an expert chemist, and one of the
outstanding botanists in the country, who are prepared to testify
with reference to the bill, if you desire to hear them. </p>

<p>The leading newspapers of the United States have recognized
the seriousness of this problem and many of them have advocated
Federal legislation to control the traffic in marihuana. In fact,
several newspapers in the city of Washington have advocated such
legislation. In a recent editorial, the Washington Times stated: </p>

<p>The marihuana cigarette is one of the most insidious of all
forms of dope, largely because of he failure of the public to
understand its fatal qualities. </p>

<p>The Nation is almost defenseless against it, having no Federal
laws to cope with it and virtually no organized campaign for
combating it. The result is tragic. </p>

<p>School children are the prey of peddlers who infest school
neighborhoods. </p>

<p>High-school boys and girls buy the destructive weed without
knowledge of it capacity for harm, and conscienceless dealers
sell it with impunity. </p>

<p>This is a national problem and it must have national
attention. </p>

<p>The fatal marihuana cigarette must be recognized as a deadly
drug and American children must be protected against it. </p>

<p>As recently as the 17th of this month, there appeared in the
editorial columns of the Washington Post and editorial on this
subject, advocating the speedy enactment by Congress of this very
bill introduced by Chairman Doughton, and now before this
committee for consideration. In its concluding paragraph, the
editorial stated: </p>

<p>With a Federal law on the books a more ambitious attack can be
launched. It is time to wipe out the evil before its
potentialities for national degeneracy become more apparent. The
legislation just introduced in Congress by Representative
Doughton would further this end. Its speedy passage is desirable.
</p>

<p>In an editorial on this subject appearing in its editorial
columns on April 10, 1937, the Washington Herald quoted the
Journal of the American Medical Association, in part, as follows:
</p>

<p>The problems of greatest menace in the United States seem to
be the rise in use of Indian hemp (marihuana) with inadequate
control laws. </p>

<p>A cartoon unusually illustrative of the insidiousness of the
illicit traffic in marihuana appeared in the Washington Herald of
April 15, under the title &quot;Another Pied Piper&quot;. The
cartoon pictured the Pied Piper in the form of a marihuana
cigarette, marching down a road described as &quot;The Dope
Habit&quot;, playing his pipe and being followed by a group of
children portrayed as &quot;Our High School Youth&quot;. </p>

<p>Apropos the seriousness of the problem which H.R. 6385 is
designed to correct, is a statement made by Commissioner
Anslinger of the Bureau of Narcotics, before a House judiciary
subcommittee on Friday of last week. In the course of his
testimony in support of two bills, which, like H.R. 6385 are
designed to aid the Federal Government in its fight to stamp out
the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, Mr. Anslinger made the
statement, supported by statistics of the Department of Justice,
that the major criminal in the United States is the drug addict;
that of all the offenses committed against the laws of this
country, the narcotic addict is the most frequent offender. </p>

<p>The purpose of H.R. 6385 is to employ the Federal taxing power
not only to raise revenue from the marihuana traffic, but also to
discourage the current and widespread undesirable use of
marihuana by smokers and drug addicts and thus drive the traffic
into channels where the plant will be put to valuable industrial,
medical, and scientific uses. In accomplishing this general
purpose two objectives should dictate the form of the proposed
legislation: First, the development of a scheme of taxation which
would raise revenue and which would also render virtually
impossible the acquisition of marihuana by person who would put
it to illicit uses without unduly interfering with the use of the
plant for industrial , medical, and scientific purposes; and
second, the development of an adequate means of publicizing
dealings in marihuana in order that the traffic may be
effectively taxed and controlled. </p>

<p>The Harrison Narcotics Act (U.S.C. title 26, sec 1040-1054
1383-1391), was designed to accomplish these same general
objectives with reference to opium and coca leaves and their
derivatives. That act required all legitimate handlers of
narcotics to register, pay an occupational tax, and file
information returns setting forth the details surrounding their
use of the drugs. It further provided that no transfer of
narcotics (with a few exceptions, notably by practicioners in
their bona-fide practice and druggists who dispense on
prescription) could be made except upon written order forms.
Since it was also provided that no one except registered persons
could legally acquire these order forms and since illicit
consumers were not eligible to register, the order-form
requirement serves the double purpose of publicizing transfers of
narcotics and restricting them to legitimate users. </p>

<p>The same objectives impelled Congress to enact the National
Firearms Act (U.S.C. title 26, sec. 1132-1132q) In that act, in
order to accomplish them, it was provided that all manufacturers,
dealers, and importers of firearms should register and pay
special taxes ranging from $200 to $500 per year. It was further
provided that firearms could not be transferred except in
pursuance of a written order form and upon payment of a $200 tax
for each transfer, transfers made to law enforcement officers
being excepted. Thus, provision was made for publicizing dealings
in firearms and for restricting their use to those persons who
would have legitimate use for them. </p>

<p>The proposed marihuana bill is something of a synthesis of
both of these statutes. It provides that all manufacturers,
compounders, importers, producers, dealers, laboratory users, and
practicioners must register and pay a special occupational tax
ranging from one dollar for practicioners and scientific users to
fifty dollars for importers compounders, and manufacturers. The
filing of information returns is also required in order to
publicize the dealings in the plant. As an additional means of
bringing the marihuana traffic out into the open, the bill also
makes it illegal, with certain exceptions, to transfer marihuana
except in pursuance of a written order form setting forth the
facts surrounding the transaction. Substantial criminal penalties
are imposed for violating the order form or registry provisions
of this bill. </p>

<p>In order to raise additional revenue and to stamp out
transfers to persons who would use marihuana for undesirable
purposes, it is further required that on any transfer which is
required to be made in pursuance of an order form a transfer tax
shall be imposed. This tax will be at the comparatively low rate
of one dollar per ounce, or fraction thereof, for transfers to
registered persons, but at the rate of $100 per ounce, or
fraction thereof, on transfers to persons who have not registered
and paid the special occupational tax whether or not they are
required to register and pay the tax. It is made a criminal
offense to acquire marihuana without having paid the transfer
tax, when payment of such tax is required. Since those who would
consume marihuana are not eligible to register under the bill,
and since the $100 tax on unregistered persons is designed to be
prohibitive, such persons could not acquire marihuana. </p>

<p>The form of the bill is such, however, as not to interfere
materially with any industrial, medical, or scientific uses which
the plant may have. Since hemp fiber and articles manufactured
therefrom are obtained from the harmless mature stalk of the
plant, all such products have been completely eliminated from the
purview of the bill by defining the term &quot;marihuana&quot; in
the bill, so as to exclude from it provisions the mature stalks
and its compounds or manufactures. </p>

<p>There are also some dealings in marihuana seeds for planting
purposes and for use in the manufacture of oil which is
ultimately employed by the paint and varnish industry. As the
seeds, unlike the mature stalk, contain the drug, the same
complete exemption could not be applied in this instance. But
this type of transaction, as well as any transfer of completed
paint or varnish products, has been exempted from transfer tax.
Any negligible medical use which marihuana may have will also be
left largely unrestricted by this bill. </p>

<p>It is provided, as in the Harrison Act, that dispensations by
registered practicioners in the course of their professional
practice and transfers made in good faith by druggists in
pursuant of a written prescription issued by a registered
practicioner shall be exempt from the order-form provisions and
from the transfer tax. Moreover, we are informed by authorities
in the Public Health Service that there is no real medical use
for the drug marihuana for the reason that its effect on human
beings is so variable and also because there are better
substitutes. </p>

<p>The heart of this bill is contained in sections 2, 6, and 7.
Section 2 imposes an occupational excise tax in the case of (1)
importers, manufacturers, and compounders of marihuana, $50 per
year; (2) producers of marihuana, $25 per year; (3) physicians,
dentists, veterinary surgeons and other practicioners one dollar
per year; (4) persons who use marihuana for research, instruction
or analysis, $1 per year; (5) dealers, $15 per year. </p>

<p>Upon payment of the tax, the taxpayer is required to register
with the collector. These occupational taxes and registration
provisions are similar to those imposed by the Harrison Narcotic
Act and the National Firearms Act. The constitutionality of such
provisions in the Harrison Narcotics Act was sustained by the
Supreme Court in Doremus vs. United States (249 U.S. 86) and on
the 29th of March of this year, the Supreme Court sustained the
validity of the similar occupational taxes and registration
provisions imposed by the National Firearms Act in the case of
Sonzinsky vs. United States (57 S. Ct. 554). </p>

<p>Section 6 of the bill makes in unlawful for anyone to transfer
marihuana except in pursuance of a written order of the person to
whom such marihuana is transferred on a form to be issued in
blank, for that purpose by the Secretary of the Treasury. This
order form requirement does not apply, however, to a transfer of
marihuana by a practicioner to his patient, or by a druggist to a
consumer who presents to the druggist a prescription issued by a
practicioner registered under the act. Nor does it apply to
exportations of marihuana, transfers of marihuana to Government
officials, transfers to paint or varnish of which marihuana is an
ingredient, transfers of marihuana to registered persons for use
in the manufacture of paint or varnish and transfers of seeds of
the marihuana plant. This order form requirement is similar to
that contained in the Harrison Narcotics Act and the National
Firearms Act. </p>

<p>Section 7 imposes a tax of one dollar per ounce upon all
transfers of marihuana to person who have paid the special
occupational tax and registered under Section 2 of the bill. It
imposes a tax of $100 per ounce on transfers of marihuana to
nonregistered person. The types of transfer exempted form the
order form requirements under section 6, such as those by
practicioners and druggists, are likewise exempted from the
payment of any tax under the provisions of this section. </p>

<p>At this point, this bill, like the National Firearms Act,
departs from the plan of the Harrison Narcotics Act which limits
the right to purchase narcotic drugs to those persons who are
permitted to register under that act. This limitation was the
focal point of attack against the constitutionality of the
Harrison Narcotics Act in the case of Doremus vs. United States,
supra, and Nigro vs. United States (1927) (276 U.S. 332). In the
latter case, the minority of the court expressed the view that
this provision in the Harrison Narcotics Act, which limited the
persons entitled to purchase narcotic drugs, was unconstitutional
on the ground that it manifested an intention on the part of the
Congress to regulate a subject matter reserved to the States
under the Tenth Amendment. </p>

<p>Thus, in order to obviate the possibility of a similar attack
up the constitutionality of this bill, it , like the National
Firearms Act, permits the transfer of marihuana to nonregistered
persons upon the payment of a heavy transfer tax. The bill would
permit the transfer of marihuana to anyone, but would impose a
$100 per ounce tax upon a transfer to a person who might use it
for purposes which are dangerous and harmful to the public, just
as the National Firearms Act permits a transfer of a machine gun
to anyone but imposes a $200 tax upon a transfer to a person who
would be likely to put it to an illegal use. </p>

<p>Although the $100 transfer tax in this bill is intended to be
prohibitive, as is the $200 transfer tax in the National Firearms
Act, it is submitted that it is constitutional as a revenue
measure. </p>

<p>In the case of Veazie Bank v. Fenno (1869, 8 Wall, 533) the
Supreme Court sustained as a proper exercise of the taxing power
a ten percent tax upon state-bank notes, notwithstanding the tax,
as it was intended to be, was so heavy as to drive such notes out
of circulation. The Court said that the fact that a tax was
prohibitive would not invalidate it if, on its face, it appeared
to be a revenue raising measure, and the fact that a tax is
burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the thing taxed, does
not make it any the less a valid exercise of the taxing power.
Where the taxing act appears on its face to be a revenue measure,
the Court stated that it is not within the province of the
judiciary to inquire other motives that may have influenced the
Congress in enacting the tax. </p>

<p>In 1913 the Ways and Means Committee reported out a bill which
became the Smoking Opium Act of January 17, 1914 (38 Stat. 277).
That act imposed a prohibitive tax of $300 per pound upon the
manufacture of smoking opium. The act further required anyone
desiring to engage in the business of manufacturing smoking opium
to give to the United States a bond in the minimum amount of
$100,000 to insure the collection of this tax. The
constitutionality of this prohibitive tax was considered by the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the case of
Lee Mow Lin v. United States (195 U.S. 27), in which the court
considered the constitutionality of the Oleomargarine Act of
1902. That act imposed a tax of one-quarter cent per pound upon
the manufacture or white oleomargarine and a tax of ten cents per
pound upon the manufacture of yellow oleomargarine. The latter
tax was deliberately designed to discourage the manufacture of
yellow oleomargarine. The constitutionality of the ten cent tax
on yellow oleomargarine was challenged on the grounds, first,
that it was so heavy as to indicate an intention by Congress to
regulate a subject-matter reserved to the States by the tenth
amendment; and second, that it was an unreasonable classification
in that the ten cent tax arbitrarily discriminated against yellow
oleomargarine and in favor of white oleomargarine in violation of
the due process clause of the fifth amendment. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court overruled both of these contentions. IN
answer to the first, it held that, although the ten cent tax was
prohibitive, it was nevertheless within the power of Congress to
impose such a tax. The Court repeated the rule that so long as a
statute appears upon its face to be a revenue measure, the Court
cannot go behind the statute and inquire as to the motives which
impelled Congress to enact it, although these motives may have
been to regulate, rather than to raise revenue. </p>

<p>In answer to the second contention, namely, that the
classification as between the two kinds of oleomargarine violated
the due process clause of the fifth amendment, the Court stated
that a classification need be based only on a reasonable
difference between the subjects of the classification. Since
yellow oleomargarine was likely to deceive the public into buying
it as butter, the classification was held to be a reasonable one.
Just as many of the States now prohibit the manufacture of
marihuana, many of the States then prohibited the manufacture of
yellow oleomargarine. Since there is obviously a material
difference between a transfer of marihuana which may be used for
purposes dangerous or harmful to the public, and a transfer of
marihuana to a legitimate dealer who will put it to industrial,
scientific, or medical uses, it is submitted that the imposition
of the one dollar tax upon transfers of marihuana to registered
persons and the $100 tax upon transfers to nonregistered persons
is a reasonable classification and, therefore, valid. </p>

<p>Finally these same principles were reiterated in the recent
case of Sonzinsky v. United States, supra. In that case, the
defendant was indicted and convicted for failing to pay the
occupational tax and register under the National Firearms Act. He
contended that the whole act was an unconstitutional, regulatory
scheme, because of the cumulative effect of the heavy
occupational tax, coupled with the transfer taxes, was to
prohibit traffic in firearms. Although the court did not pass
upon the validity of the transfer tax standing by itself, the
court brushed aside this argument, remarking: </p>

<p>It has long been established that an act of Congress which on
its face purports to be an exercise of the taxing power is not
any the less so because the tax is burdensome, or tends to
restrict or suppress the thing taxed. </p>

<p>It is urged, therefore, that the $100 transfer tax imposed by
H.R. 6385 is a valid taxing provision on the authority of the
banknote, smoking opium, oleomargarine, and firearms cases,
supra, which hold that if a statute is on its face a revenue
measure, the court will not inquire as to what other motives may
have impelled Congress to enact it. Of course if a purported
taxing measure appears on its face to be regulatory, that is,
contains regulatory provisions which are not reasonably necessary
to protect or aid in the collection of the revenue, but the tax
is imposed to compel obedience to such regulatory provisions, the
statute will be held unconstitutional as an attempt by Congress
to regulate a subject-matter which is reserved to the States by
the tenth amendment. The court so held in the Child Labor Tax
Case (1921) 259 U.S. 20 and Hill v. Wallace (1922 259 U.S. 44) </p>

<p>In the Child Labor Case, the court considered a statute which
levied a ten percent tax upon the annual net earnings of
employers who had at any time during the year employed child
labor except where it was done in an honest mistake as to the
employee's age. The statute was held unconstitutional as an
attempt to regulate a subject matter reserved to the States by
the tenth amendment, because the purported excise was not a tax,
but a penalty to enforce the regulation of child labor. </p>

<p>As indicative of this fact, the court pointed out that the act
provided a heavy exaction for departure from a detailed and
specific course of conduct n business set out on the face of the
law, without basing the amount of the so-called tax in any degree
upon the extent or frequency of the departures. The element of
intent involved in the act was also associated, the court
thought, with criminal penalties rather than taxes. Finally, the
court pointed to the fact that the Secretary of Labor was to
participate in the administration of the act, and stated that
this also indicated that the law was not a revenue measure, since
revenue laws are administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. </p>

<p>The Grains Futures Trading Act which was held unconstitutional
in Hill v. Wallace, imposed a tax of twenty cents a bushel on all
contracts for the sale of grain for future delivery,. but
exempted contracts, consummated on boards of trade designated as
contract markets by the Secretary of Agriculture, the designation
being reserved for those markets which had complied with a large
number of stringent regulations set out in the act. The court
found it impossible to escape the conclusion that the act under
consideration was regulatory on its face, and that the tax was
merely imposed as a penalty to compel boards of trade to comply
with these regulations, many of which were not relevant to the
collection of the tax. </p>

<p>The court pointed out that the elaborate mechanism set up in
the statute for hearings by the Secretary of Agriculture to
determine whether or not a particular board of trade had complied
with the prescribed regulations and the fact that the title of
the act expressly recited that one of its purposes was that of
regulating boards of trade were also strong evidence of the
regulatory nature of the act. </p>

<p>It is submitted that the $100 tax imposed by H.R. 6385 could
not be held unconstitutional under these cases, for the only
regulation is that bill with which the taxpayer need comply is
that which requires him to make a transfer of marihuana upon an
order form. This order form requirement cannot be resorted to,
however, as indicating that the $100 transfer tax is intended to
regulate a subject-matter reserved to the States under the tenth
amendment, for the reason that the much more drastic order form
requirement in the Harrison Narcotic Act was upheld by the
Supreme Court in Doremus v. United States, supra, as a regulation
reasonably necessary to aid in the collection of the occupational
taxes imposed by that act. In the course of its decision the
Court stated: </p>

<p>Congress, with full power over the subject, short of arbitrary
and unreasonable action which is not to be assumed, inserted
these provisions in an act specifically providing for the raising
of revenue. Considered of themselves, we think they tend to keep
the traffic aboveboard and subject to the inspection of those
authorized to collect the revenue. They tend to diminish the
opportunity of unauthorized persons to obtain the drugs and sell
them clandestinely without paying the tax imposed by the Federal
law. </p>

<p>After the Doremus case, Congress amended the Harrison Narcotic
Act, raising the occupational taxes and imposing a manufacturer
excise tax on narcotics. In Nigro v. United States, supra, the
Supreme Court again sustained the order for requirement as
reasonable and necessary to aid in the collection of the
occupational taxes and, in passing, stated that it was also
reasonably necessary to aid the collection of the manufacturers'
excise taxes. Furthermore, the Supreme Court sustained the
additional and more stringent requirement absent in the National
Firearms Act and in this bill, which limits the persons to whom
the order forms may be sold and, consequently, those to whom
narcotics may be sold. In that decision, the Court stated: </p>

<p>It would seem admissible and wise, in a law seeking to impose
taxes for the sale of an elusive subject, to require conformity
to a prescribed method of sale and delivery calculated to
disclose or make more difficult any escape from the tax. If this
may be done, any departure from the steps enjoined may be
punished, and added penalties may be fixed for successive
omissions, but all for the one ultimate purpose of making it
difficult to sell opium or other narcotics without registering or
paying the tax. </p>

<p>The reasonableness of such requirements is will illustrated in
the many limitations which were imposed upon the ancient freedom
in the making and sales of distilled spirits, to the end that the
collection of the heavy tax on the subject matter might be
successfully secured in spite of the temptation to avoid the tax.
The provision of section 2 making it an offense to sell unless
the purchaser gives a particular official form of order to the
seller was enacted with a like object. The sale without such an
order thus carries its illegality on its face. Its absence
dispenses with the necessity of sending to examine the list of
those registered to learn whether the seller is engaged in a
legal sale. The requirement that the official forms can only be
bought and obtained by one entitled to buy, who name shall be
stamped on the order form, and that after the sale the order form
shall be recorded, effects a kind off registration of lawful
purchasers, in addition to one of lawful sellers, and keeps
selling and buying on a plane where evasion of the tax will be
difficult. </p>

<p>Since the similar order-form requirement in the Harrison Act
was sustained as a regulation reasonably necessary to aid in the
collection of the occupational taxes imposed by that act, anyone
challenging the constitutionality of the $100 transfer tax
imposed by this bill will be unable to rely upon the order-form
requirement as indicating that the $100 tax is regulatory in
character, but will be compelled to rely solely upon the fact
that the tax is too heavy. Thus, the $100 transfer tax is brought
squarely within the bank-note, smoking-opium, and oleomargarine
cases which establish the proposition that the prohibitive
character of a tax does not make it any the less a valid revenue
measure. </p>

<p>In the final analysis, after the committee has given full
consideration to the subject of marihuana, it is not beyond the
realm of possibility that the committee may conclude that the
legitimate uses of marihuana are so negligible as compared to the
injurious effect it has upon the public health and morals of the
people of this country, that the committee will conclude to
impose a prohibitive tax upon the production, manufacture, and
sale of marihuana, and thus discourage its use in any form in
this country. </p>

<p>MR. LEWIS: The treatment of this subject as a matter of
method, and so far as constitutional basis is concerned, is about
the same as the Harrison Narcotic Act, is it not? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: With one exception. </p>

<p>MR. LEWIS: I was thinking you might add this drug as an
amendment to the Harrison Narcotic Act. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: No; there are three reasons why we think that
would be a bad thing to do. </p>

<p>The first is that while the Harrison Narcotic Act would
include producers, there are actually no producers in the United
States of the plant from which opium and coca leaves are
obtained. Therefore, we have never had a problem under the
Harrison Narcotic Act with respect to products which are produced
in this country but have only been concerned with products which
are imported from abroad. </p>

<p>here we have the reverse situation. Practically all of this
marihuana is grown in the United States and for that reason,
instead of being concerned only with importation and sale as
under the Harrison Act, provision must also be made for
regulation of production of marihuana. </p>

<p>There is the further point that opium and coca leaves, which
are the subjects of the Harrison Act, are legitimately used
almost exclusively as medicines, whereas there are many
industrial uses for marihuana. That is another distinction
between the Harrison Act and this bill. </p>

<p>The third is this, that the Harrison Narcotic Act has twice
been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States and
lawyers are no longer challenging its constitutionality. If an
entirely new and different subject matter were to be inserted in
its provisions, the act might be subjected to further
constitutional attacks. </p>

<p>We feel, in view of the reasons I have cited, that this
problem is one that should be dealt with under a separate act. </p>

<p>We have departed from the Harrison Narcotic Act in one major
respect, and we have done that because the Ways and Means
Committee departed from the plan of the Harrison Act in preparing
the National Firearms Act. </p>

<p>Under the Harrison Narcotic Act no one can buy narcotics
unless he has registered and paid the occupational tax. In the
National Firearms Act the committee did not follow that plan.
Anyone is permitted to buy a machine gun or a submachine gun, but
he must pay a $200 transfer tax, and carry out the purchase on an
official order form. </p>

<p>The focal point of attack on the Harrison Narcotic Act by the
judges who dissented in the Doremus case and the Nigro case, was
that the provision of the act which limited the persons to whom
narcotics could be sold clearly indicated that the primary
purpose of the act was not to raise revenue but to regulate
matters which were reserved to the States under the tenth
amendment. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON How did the Court stand in those cases? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: In the first case the Court stood 5 to 4, and in
the second case the Court stood 66 to 3. </p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: What was the firearms case? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: The firearms case involved only the occupational
tax under the Firearms Act. </p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Was that decision unanimous? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, that was a unanimous decision. That is the
decision of March 29, In the Firearms Act you arranged it of that
anybody can buy a machine gun but he must pay a transfer tax of
$200 and would have to use an order form. </p>

<p>We have looked into the records in connection with the
transfer tax in the Firearms Act, and we found that only one
machine gun was purchased at $200 last year. </p>

<p>MR. DINGELL: Legitimately? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, this bill would permit anyone to purchase
marihuana, as was done in the National Firearms Act in permitting
anyone to buy a machine gun, but he would have to pay a tax of
$100 per ounce of marihuana and make his purchase on an official
order form. A person who wants to buy marihuana would have to go
to the collector and get an order form in duplicate, and buy the
$100 tax stamp and put it on the original order form there. He
would take the original to the vendor, and keep the duplicate. If
the purchaser wants to transfer it, the person who purchases the
marihuana from him has to do the same thing and pay the $100 tax.
That is the scheme that has been adopted to sto high-school
children from getting marihuana. </p>

<p>MR.VINSON: What is the fair market value, per ounce, of
marihuana? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: In its raw state it is about a dollar per ounce,
as a drug. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: I notice in your statement -- and I want to say it
is a good statement; the gentleman does not have any other kind
of a statement when he comes before our committee. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I thank you. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: You say in your statement that ---- </p>

<p>It is provided, as in the Harrison Act, that dispensations by
registered practitioners in the course of their professional
practice and transfers made in god faith by druggists in
pursuance f a written prescription issued by registered
practitioners shall be exempt from the order-form provisions and
from the transfer tax. </p>

<p>I was wondering whether the good-faith requirement was in the
Harrison Act. </p>

<p>MR. TIPTON: The good-faith requirement is not in the Harrison
Act. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: It seems to me that is a weakness of the Harrison
Act. I think the good-faith provisions in this act will
strengthen the law. </p>

<p>MR. TIPTON: Exactly. That is the reason we put that in there.
That provision is not in the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: It is not included in the Harrison Act? </p>

<p>MR. TIPTON: No. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Mr. Tipton says they have had difficulty in
enforcing the Harrison Act because of the absence of that
requirement. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: I had the notion that the provision would really
strengthen the law in regard to a menace of this kind. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: I would like to have some information as to where
you get this plant. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I have completed my statement, and I may say, Mr.
Vinson, that we have here a pharmacologist, a chemist, and an
outstanding botanist, who can give you information of that
nature. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: I take it, Mr. Hester, from your citations of the
decisions in the Doremus case, and in the Firearms case, together
with the decision in the Veazie case and the McCray, or
Oleomargarine case - - - </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: (interposing) We have cited five cases. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: What is the fifth one? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: that is a decision from the Circuit Court of
Appeals of the Eighth Circuit which sustained the imposition of a
tax of $300 per pound upon smoking opium. </p>

<p>MR. VINSON: In view of these cases you have no doubt as to the
power of Congress to enact this character of legislation? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: My answer to that is, no; we have given it a great
deal of consideration. In the final analysis we submit it to your
judgment. </p>

<p>The Supreme court, in the Nigro case and in the Doremus case
held that the regulatory provisions of the act, which even
limited the class of people who could buy narcotics, were
constitutional, since they were regulations reasonably necessary
to aid in collecting the revenue. Therefore in considering the
constitutionality of H.R. 6385 we do not even have to consider
the order-form provision in that bill. Consequently, there is
nothing left in the bill to consider but the prohibitive tax, and
the McCray case, which held constitutional ten percent tax on
yellow oleomargarine, and the Bank Note case and other cases
which we have cited clearly hold that, although the tax may be
prohibitive, if there are no regulatory provisions on the face of
the act which the court may say are not reasonable and necessary
to aid in the collection of the tax, the tax is constitutional. </p>

<h1>STATEMENT OF H. J. ANSLINGER, </h1>

<p><b>COMMISSIONER OF NARCOTICS, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS, DEPARTMENT
OF THE TREASURY</b> </p>

<hr>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Mr. Chairman, my name is H. J.
Anslinger; I am Commissioner of Narcotics in the Bureau of
Narcotics, in the Treasury Department. </p>

<p>Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Ways and Means
Committee, this traffic in marihuana is increasing to such an
extent that it has come to the be cause for the greatest national
concern. </p>

<p>This drug is as old as civilization itself. Homer wrote about,
as a drug that made me forget their homes, and that turned them
into swine. In Persia, a thousand years before Christ, there was
a religious and military order founded which was called the
Assassins and they derived their name from the drug called
hashish which is now known in this country as marihuana. They
were noted for their acts of cruelty, and the word
&quot;assassin&quot; very aptly describes the drug. </p>

<p>The plant from which the drugs comes is a hardy annual,
growing from 3 to 16 feet in height. </p>

<p>Marihuana is the same as Indian hemp, hashish. It is sometimes
cultivated in backyards. Over here in Maryland some of it has
been found, and last fall we discovered three acres of it in the
Southwest. </p>

<p>As I say, marihuana is the same as Indian hemp, and is
sometimes found as a residual weed, and sometimes as the result
of a dissemination of birdseed. It is known as cannabin, cannabis
Americana, or Cannabis Sativa. Marihuana is the Mexican term for
cannabis indica. We seem to have adopted the Mexican terminology,
and we call it marihuana, which means good feeling. In the
underworld it is referred to by such colorful, colloquial names
as reefer, muggles, Indian hay, hot hay, and weed. It is known in
various countries by a variety of names. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS: </b>In literature it is known as hashish, is it
not? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>Yes, sir. There is a great deal of use
of it in Egypt, particularly. It was found years ago in Egypt.
The traffic has grown so that something like 14 percent of the
population are addicts. In India it is sold over the counter to
the addicts, direct, and there it is known as bhang and ganja. </p>

<p>At the Geneva Convention is 1895 the term &quot;cannabis&quot;
included only the dried flowering or fruiting top of the
pistillate plant as the plant source of the dangerous resin, from
which the resin had not been extracted. That designation was used
in the uniform State act. &quot;but research that has been made
during the past few months has shown that this definition is not
sufficient, because it has been found by experiment that the
leaves of the pistillate plant as well as the leaves of the
staminate plant contain the active principle up to 50 percent of
the strength prescribed by the United States Pharmacopoeia. </p>

<p>So we have urged the States to revise their definition so as
to include all parts of the plant, as it now seems that the seeds
and portions other than the dried flowering tops contain
positively dangerous substances. </p>

<p>We were anticipating a challenge in one of the States of that
old definition. There was a case in Florida recently in which a
defendant appealed to a higher court on the ground that the
prosecution had not proven that this was the dried flowered top
of the pistillate plant. </p>

<p>The higher court said: </p>

<p>&quot;We are of the opinion, therefore, that the information
was insufficient to clearly apprise accused of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him because of the sale of
cigarettes containing cannabis, from which the resin had not been
extracted may relate to the resin of the staminate plant, the
resin of which appears to be harmless.&quot; </p>

<p>As a matter of fact the staminate leaves are about as harmless
as a rattlesnake. </p>

<p>So in this act it was necessary to make the definition all
inclusive. </p>

<p>In medical schools, the physician-to-be is taught that without
opium he would be like a one-armed man. That is true, because you
cannot get along without opium. </p>

<p>But here we have drug that is not like opium. Opium has all of
the good of Dr. Jekyll and all the evil of Mr. Hyde. This drug is
entirely the monster Hyde, the harmful effect of which cannot be
measured. </p>

<p>I have here an excerpt from a report made to the League of
Nations by the Council at its last session. It says:<br>
</p>

<p>Excerpt of League of Nations Document O.C. 1542 (O) Dated
Geneva, February 17, 1937<br>
</p>

<p>Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous
Drugs, Sub-Committee on Cannabis<br>
</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. J. Bouquet, hospital pharmacist, Tunis,
inspector of pharmacies, Tunis, containing answers to
questionnaire submitted to the experts)<br>
</p>

<p>VII (P. 39)<br>
</p>

<p>(7) (A) Do any preparations of Indian hemp exist possessing a
therapeutic value such that nothing else can take their place for
medical purposes? </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>(a) Indian hemp extract has been recommended for the
preparation of corn cures products, that most often consist of a
solution of salicylic acid in collodion; the action of the
cannabis extract is nil. </p>

<p>At my request, experiments were made for several months in
1912 with different preparations of cannabis, without the
addition of other synergetic substances (Profession Lannois'
Service, Lyons Hospital). The conclusion reached was that in a
few rare cases Indian hemp gives good results, but that in
general it is not superior to other medicaments which can be used
in therapeutics for the treatment of the same affliction. </p>

<p>To sum up, Indian hemp, like many other medicaments, has
enjoyed for a time a vogue which is not justified by the results
obtained. Therapeutics would not lose much if it were removed
from the list of medicaments. </p>

<p><b>MR. DINGELL: </b>I want to be certain what this is. Is this
the same weed that grows wild in some of our Western States which
is sometimes called the loco weed? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir, that is another family. </p>

<p><b>MR. DINGELL:</b> That is also a harmful drug-producing
weed, is it not? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Not to my knowledge. It is not used by
humans. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN: </b>In what particular sections does this
weed grow wild? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>In almost every state in the Union
today. </p>

<p><b>MR. REED: </b>What you are describing is a plant which has
a rather large flower? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir, a very small flower. </p>

<p><b>MR. REED: </b>It is not Indian hemp? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>It is Indian hemp. We have some
specimens here. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>When was this brought to your attention as
being a menace among our own people? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>About ten years ago. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>Why did you wait until 1937 to bring in a
recommendation of this kind? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>Ten years ago we only heard about it
throughout the Southwest. It is only in the last few years that
it has become a national menace. It has grown like wildfire, but
it has only become a national menace in the last three years. It
is only in the last two years that we have had to send reports
about it to the League of Nations. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON:</b> We did not have to have any convention
adopted by the League of Nations in order to legislate on this
subject? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>No; but it was covered in one of the
conventions. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>It seems to me you have been rather slow in
getting to this legislation. </p>

<p><b>MR. FULLER. </b>I do not think that is any defense for this
measure. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> We have been urging uniform state
legislation on the several States, and itt was only last month
that the last State legislature adopted such legislation. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>You have not urged the passage of any
legislation upon Congress. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>There is no law in the District. This
uniform act has been urged upon the states for four or five
years. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>But you have not urged Congress to pass
this act or anything that looks like it until now. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>No, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. FULLER: </b>That is no defense, if it is a good
measure. </p>

<p><b>MR. VINSON: </b>I am not talking about their defense. It
seems to me it has taken a long time to get this before Congress.
</p>

<p><b>MR. FULLER: </b>It took a hundred years to get the Harrison
Narcotic Act. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It is only in the last two years that we
have a report of seizures anywhere but in the Southwest. Las
year, New York State reported 195 tons seized, whereas before
that I do not believe that New York could have reported one ton
seized. </p>

<p>Let me quote from this report to the League of Nations: </p>

<p>This discussion disclosed that, from the medical point of view
in some countries the use of Indian hemp in its various forms is
regarded as in no way indispensable and that it is therefore
possible that little objection would be raised to drafting
limitations upon medical use of derivatives. </p>

<p>That is only last year. </p>

<p>Here is what Dr. J. Bouquet, hospital pharmacist at Tunis, and
inspector of pharmacists at Tunis, says. He is the outstanding
expert on cannabis in the world. He says: </p>

<p>To sum up, Indian hemp, like many other medicaments, has
enjoyed for a time a vogue which is not justified by the results
obtained. Therapeutics would not lose much if it were removed
from the list of medicaments.<br>
</p>

<p>That comes from the greatest authority on cannabis in the
world today. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK: </b>What are its first manifestations, a
feeling of grandeur and self-exaltation, and things of that sort?
</p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It affects different individuals in
different ways. Some individuals have a complete loss of sense of
time or a sense of value. They lose their sense of place. That
have an increased feeling of physical strength and power. </p>

<p>Some people will fly into a delirious rage, and they are
temporarily irresponsible and may commit violent crimes. Other
people will laugh uncontrollably. It is impossible to say what
the effect will be on any individual. Those research men who have
tried it have always been under control. They have always
insisted upon that. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Is it used by the criminal class? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>Yes, it is. It is dangerous to the mind
and body, and particularly dangerous to the criminal type,
because it releases all of the inhibitions. </p>

<p>I have here statements by the foremost expert in the world
talking on this subject, and by Dr. Cutter a noted and
distinguished medical man in this country. </p>

<p>(The statements referred to are as follows:) </p>

<p>(From the report by Dr. J. Bouquet, Tunis, to the League of
Nations) </p>

<p>Does Indian hemp (Cannabis Sativa) in its various forms give
rise to drug addiction? </p>

<p>The use of cannabis, whether smoked or ingested in its various
form, undoubtedly gives rise to a form of addiction, which has
serious social consequences (abandonment of work, propensity to
theft and crime, disappearance of reproductive power). </p>

<p>From the Washington Post, Nov. 23, 1936 </p>

<p><b>TODAY'S HEALTH TALK</b> </p>

<p>By Dr. Irving S. Cutter </p>

<p><b>A Dangerous Intoxicant</b> </p>

<p>Ever since the world began man has been searching for
chemicals or charms that would relieve pain. Out of the East came
Indian hemp, and it is surprising how rapidly its properties were
recognized and how widespread became its use. </p>

<p>History relates that in the eleventh century a remarkable sect
of Mohammedans established themselves as a powerful military unit
under the leadership of a sheik who led his marauding band to
victory while under the influence of hemp. In South Africa the
Hottentots smoked the drug under the name of dagga. </p>

<p>The plant was originally native in Persia and India, but
because of the desirability of its fiber it is now cultivated in
all parts of the world. For the last few years marihuana, as it
is commonly called, has been sold in the United States and
Canada, chiefly in the form of cigarettes, which are peddled
frequently in dance halls. Much of the raw material comes from
Mexico or the West Indies, and occasionally press dispatches will
report that the weed had been grown even within prison walls. </p>

<p>As a stimulant to crime the drug is probably as important as
cocaine, certainly far more so than opium or any of its
derivatives, and narcotic-control agencies will be put to a
severe test in routing out this traffic. </p>

<p>As a rule the addict passes into a dreamy state in which
judgment is lost and imagination runs riot. Fantasies arise which
are limitless and extravagant. Scenes pass before the mind's eye
in kaleidoscopic confusion and there is no sense of the passing
of time. </p>

<p>Under relatively large doses consciousness does not leave
entirely, even though actions and movements are out of control.
As the influence of the drug persists there may be periods of
stupor from which, however, the patient can be aroused. In most
individuals there is no succeeding nausea and the thrill seeker
finds inhibitions destroyed and, abandoning his normal sense of
propriety, he may do and say things quite foreign to his makeup. </p>

<p>Cannabis indica is the medicinal preparation known to
physicians. But the potent resin produced chiefly by the top of
the female plant is as much sought after in certain quarters as
is opium. Its legitimate use in the field of medicine is
relatively limited, as other drugs more accurate and dependable
as to effects have largely taken its place. </p>

<p>Cases of fatal poisoning rarely if ever occur. Nevertheless,
it is one of the dangerous drugs that should be known only to be
shunned--an intoxicant with the most vicious propensities. </p>

<p>Copyright, 1936, by the Chicago-Tribune, New York Times
Syndicate, Inc.<br>
</p>

<p>I will give you gentleman just a few outstanding evidences of
crimes that have been committed as a result of the use of
marihuana. </p>

<p><b>MR. REED:</b> The testimony before the committee of which I
was formerly chairman in reference to heroin said in reference to
the effect of it that it made men feel fearless, and that a great
majority of the crimes of great violence that were committed were
committed by addicts, and one man stated that it would make a
rabbit fight a bulldog. Does this drug have a similar effect? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER: </b>Here is a gang of seven young men, all
seven of them, young men under 21 years of age. They terrorized
central Ohio for more than two months, and they were responsible
for 38 stick-ups. They all boast they did those crimes while
under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS: </b>Was that as an excuse, or a defense? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> Does it strengthen the criminal will; does
it operate as whisky might, to provoke recklessness? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> I think it makes them irresponsible. A
man does not know what he is doing. It has not been recognized as
a defense by the courts, although it has been used as a defense. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS: </b>Probably the word &quot;excuse&quot; or
&quot;mitigation&quot; would be better than defense, I think. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Here is one of the worst cases I have
seen. The district attorney told me the defendant in this case
pleaded that he was under the influence of marihuana when he
committed that crime, but that has not been recognized. </p>

<p>We have several cases of that kind. There was one town in Ohio
where a young man went into a hotel and held up the clerk and
killed him, and his defense was that he had been affected by the
use of marihuana. </p>

<p><b>MR. FULLER: </b>The only question was whether or not he
knew what he was doing, whether he was insane. That is always a
defense, whether or not a man is in such a state of mind that he
does not know good from evil. The question is whether or not his
mind is right, whether he is responsible. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> As to these young men I was telling you
about, one of them said if he had killed somebody on the spot he
would not have known it. </p>

<p>In Florida a 21-year-old boy under the influence of this drug
killed his parents and his brothers and sisters. The evidence
showed that he had smoke marihuana. </p>

<p>In Chicago recently two boys murdered a policeman while under
the influence of marihuana. Not long ago we found a 15-year-old
boy going insane because, the doctor told the enforcement
officers, he thought the boy was smoking marihuana cigarettes.
They traced the sale to some man who had been growing marihuana
and selling it to these boys all under 15 years of age, on a
playground there. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>In my home town just recently two boys
were sent to the penitentiary for life for killing a man, and
their defense was built upon the fact that they had used a drug.
I do not believe it was this drug. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> There have been a number of cases in
Ohio recently. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>The defense was made for them by a very
successful lawyer. </p>

<p><b>MR. REED: </b>Is there any cure for a person who becomes an
addict? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> I do not think there is such a thing as
not being able to cure an addict. Marihuana addicts my go to a
Federal narcotic farm. But I have not seen many addicts who could
not be cured. An addict could drop it and he will not experience
any ill effects. </p>

<p>One of these boys I referred to went insane, and they stopped
it. Here in Colorado -- and Colorado seems to have had a lot of
cases of violence recently -- in Alamosa County, and in Huerfano
County the sheriff was killed as the result of the action of a
man under the influence of marihuana. Recently in Baltimore a
young man was sent to the electric chair for having raped a girl
while under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>I will show you how this traffic is increasing. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Have you completed your statement in
reference to the criminal cases? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> I have a number of cases here. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Are you acquainted with the report of
the public prosecutor at New Orleans in 1931? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> I think that would be valuable. That was
a case where 125 our of 450 prisoners were found to be marihuana
addicts, and slightly less than one-half of the murderers were
marihuana addicts, and about 20 percent of them were charged with
being addicts of what they call &quot;merry wonder&quot;. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is the same thing. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> You are acquainted with that? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, I have that report. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> There was a report from other cities
also. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is one of the finest reports that
has been written on marihuana by that district attorney. He had
daily contact with the problem and saw its effect on crime in
that city. </p>

<p>I might say in that connection, that he said this-- and this
is the report of Eugene Stanley -- in which he has said: </p>

<p>Inasmuch as the harmful effects of the use of the drug is
becoming more widely known each day, and it has been classed as a
narcotic by the statutory laws of 17 American states --</p>

<p>Since that time we have that in every State--- </p>

<p>England and Mexico, and persons addicted to its use have been
made eligible for treatment in the United States narcotic farms,
the United States Government, unquestionably, will be compelled
to adopt a consistent attitude toward the drug, and include it in
the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Law, so as to give Federal aid to the
States in their effort to suppress a traffic as deadly and as
destructive to society as the traffic in the other forms of
narcotics now prohibited by the Harrison Act.</p>

<p>This drug is not being used by those who have been using
heroin and morphine. It is being used by a different class, by a
mostly younger group of people. The age of the morphine and
heroin addict is increasing all the time, whereas the marihuana
smoker is quite young. </p>

<p><b>MR. DINGELL:</b> I am just wondering whether the marihuana
addict graduates into a heroin, an opium, or a cocaine user. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir; I have not heard of a case of
that kind. I think it is an entirely different class. The
marihuana addict does not go in that direction. </p>

<p><b>MR. DINGELL:</b> And the hardened narcotic user does not
fall back on marihuana. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir: he would not touch that. Dr.
Walter Bromberger, a distinguished psychiatrist in New York has
made this statement: </p>

<p>Young men between the ages of 16 and 25 are frequent smokers
of marihuana; even boys of 10 to 14 are initiated (frequently in
school groups); to them as other; marijuana holds out the thrill.
Since the economic depression the number of marihuana smokers has
increased by vagrant youths coming into contact with older
psychopaths. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> Do they make their own cigarettes? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. The cigarette is usually
rolled by the peddler. It is crudely rolled cigarette. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Is not Dr. Bromberger the senior
psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> What did he say in reference to crime? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> He argued one way and then he argued
another way. His conclusions were based on a study made of those
men who had been sentenced to prison. But that is not a fair
conclusion because at the present time we have so many in prison
in the several states sent up as a result of using marihuana. </p>

<p>I think in some states today that study would show a fairer
conclusion than he arrived at, although in one part of his
article he did say he believed that this excited to crime a man
who would be less likely to commit a crime. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> He did admit that it was a drug? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. I think he realized, and his
article indicated that he realized, the danger of it. </p>

<p>Last year several states made 338 seizures of marihuana that
we know of. In most of those we participated, because we are
cooperating with the states in carrying out the uniform State
legislation. We have also assisted several states by sending
chemists to the local police to show them how to identify this
drug, and we have conducted chemical research here. </p>

<p>Most of the complaints about this drug have been coming to the
Federal office, and because time is of the essence we would like
to have this legislation enacted very much, so we can step into
the situation where it is highly desirable that we do so. </p>

<p>I will refer you to the case of a man in one of the Southern
States. One of our good friends gave us information to indicate
that this man had about a ton of these high explosives stored in
his barn. There was no Federal law and no State law. We took up
the matter with the attorney general of that state, and we had to
wait until the state had its act enacted, before we could take
any action. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN:</b> How many states have laws in reference to
marihuana? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Every state, except the District of
Columbia. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN:</b> You said there was no state law. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> In that particular state at that time
there was no state law. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN:</b> The states now all do cooperate? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Every one of them, yes, sir. But they do
not all have central enforcement agencies. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> You say every state has a law, and there
are about 35 of the states that have the uniform state act? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. The uniform state act has been
adopted by 35 states. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN:</b> With this uniform state legislation, why
can they not stamp this out? What progress are they making? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> They are making some progress, as is
indicated by the 338 seizures made last year. Last year the state
of Pennsylvania destroyed 200,000 pounds. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> Under the uniform state act the growth and
distribution is prohibited. Is that correct? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is true in most of the states. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> What would the effect be in this case of our
imposing an act under which we would be collecting revenue, and
making the growth and distribution legitimate from the standpoint
of the Federal Government. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> The state acts provide for that. They
provide for legitimate distribution and for licensing of the
grower under certain conditions. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> Does this act require the licensing of the
grower? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It requires registration. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> What is the legitimate distribution of this
drug? You spoke of the industries. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> There is its use in medicine. Then the
hemp product is used in some parts of Kentucky, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin. It is grown for hemp purposes. It makes very fine
cordage, and this legislation exempts the mature stalk when it is
grown for hemp purposes. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> There are other commercial purposes: </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> There is fiber out of which hats are
made? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is not done so much in this
country. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> There is some of that. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Just a little. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Then is not the seed used for paints and
oil? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> They import all their seed from
Manchuria. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> And it is also used as a constituent of
commercial bird seed? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Mr. Lewis asked you a question about the
commercial purposes. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Those are the only commercial purposes
that I know of. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>Mr. Hester said that he thought the
commercial purposes were practically negligible . I understand
you to say that most of the products that are made from the seed
are made from imported seed. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is for oil. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>You say that 35 of the states have adopted
uniform legislation. Where do they get that uniformity from? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is from the commissioners on
uniform state laws. They were adopted by the American Bar
Association and approved by the American Medical Association and
some of the drug trade. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>If each state has a law on this subject I
wonder why that does not reach it. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It does reach it, but in spite of the
act, we get requests from public officials from different states,
and I will name particularly the states of Colorado, Kansas, New
Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma that have urged Federal
legislation for the purpose of enabling us to cooperate with the
several states. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>It seems to me if the states have taken
such action on this subject so far, and if we are going to take
any action at all, we ought to be able to stamp it out. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> I think this bill will do that. </p>

<p><b>MR. JENKINS: </b>If you are going to temporize with them
and say as it seems you say here &quot;No, we can not stamp it
out; we will encourage its growth. it is all right to grow
it.&quot; I do not see how you will stamp it out. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> We do not do that for hemp production,
and we recognize the fact that it is grown, that the farmers in
some of these states grow it for hemp purposes. I think about
10,000 acres cover that. Dr. Dewey can tell you about that. He
has been with this problem for 30 years, and I would defer to his
judgment, particularly as to legitimate uses. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> There are state laws in reference to
other drugs? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> The uniform state act covers opium and
its derivatives, coca leaf and its derivatives, but there is a
twilight zone there that the peddler breaks right through if the
state has not taken action. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> This is a tax measure and we might as
well get the revenue out of it that enables the Federal
government to cooperate with the states in connection with the
state activities. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> And you get a certain uniformity. You
also get to help the local police, and the always want it. You
also get to help the state police, and the always ask for this
help. Whenever they find marihuana the first place on which they
call for help is the Federal narcotic office, so that they can
take a man along who is a specialist on narcotic matters. </p>

<p>The have 35 states under the uniform act, and we have Federal
legislation dealing with opium and coca leaves. </p>

<p>With this legislation we will make a drive on this traffic,
and bend every effort to stamp it out, and it will not cost very
much. </p>

<p>I say that advisedly because we have men throughout the
country at the present time who are dealing with the narcotic
problem. But the use of marihuana is increasing. </p>

<p>I want to show you one more thing and that is in reference to
the international side of this problem. Canada made some seizures
over here last year and they pointed the finger of scorn at us
and said, &quot;Why do you not do something about this?&quot; We
had to admit that we did not have any legislation. </p>

<p>There is some evidence that this drug is being smuggled to
China today. We have always pointed the finger of scorn at China,
and now marihuana is being smuggled out to China, by sailors. </p>

<p>We are far ahead of any government when it comes to the 1912
Hague Convention, and the 1931 convention, but we are behind on
the 1925 convention. We are not signatories to it, but we
cooperate with them. </p>

<p>We were in a curious position only a few months ago when an
exporter sent a lot of cannabis to a British firm. It was a
legitimate shipment, but the British law demanded and export
certificate, and we had to tell the British government that we
did not have a law to compel that exporter to stop the shipment
of cannabis. He will probably do so, as a matter of cooperation.
But we had to warn him to stop violating British law, and that
goes for practically every government on the face of the earth,
except the United States. Over 50 nations have national
legislation on this problem, and it is very humiliating to have
to say to these people when they trace the matter right to our
shore, to tell them that we have no legislation to deal with that
problem: </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> You spoke about the District of Columbia
having no law. How about the Territories? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Hawaii has a law. I cannot tell you
about Alaska. Puerto Rico dos have a law. The only place I am not
sure about is Alaska. </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> You are sure about the District of Columbia?
</p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Not having a law? </p>

<p><b>MR. LEWIS:</b> Yes. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir; because last year there were
15 dealers arrested here for peddling marihuana, and they had to
be prosecuted for practicing pharmacy without a license. </p>

<p><b>MR. BUCK:</b> Have you suggested the enactment of such a
law to the Committee on the District of Columbia? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir; they have had a proposed
uniform state laws for 3 or 4 years. </p>

<p><b>MR. BUCK: </b>Have they taken action on it at all? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. THOMPSON: </b>What is the price of marihuana? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> The addict pays anywhere from 10 to 25
cents per cigarette. It will be sold by the cigarette. In illicit
traffic the bulk price would be around $20 per pound.
Legitimately, the bulk is around $2 per pound. </p>

<p><b>MR. THOMPSON:</b> How does that compare with the price of
opium or morphine? Do the class of people who use this drug use
it because it is cheaper than the other kinds? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is one reason, yes, sir. To be a
morphine or heroin addict it would cost you from $5 to $8 a day
to maintain your supply. But if you want to smoke a cigarette you
pay 10 cents. </p>

<p><b>MR. BOERNE: </b>Just one of them will knock the socks off
of you. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> One of them can do it. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Some of those cigarettes are sold much
cheaper that 10 cents, are they not? In other words, it is a
low-priced cigarette, and that is one of the reasons for the
tremendous increases in its use. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes; it is low enough in price for
school children to buy it. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> And they have parties in different parts
of the country that they call &quot;reefer parties&quot;. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir; we have heard of them, and
know of them. </p>

<p><b>MR. FULLER:</b> Another thing is that they will not be able
to get other kinds of dope, but they do have an opportunity to
get this marihuana, which causes it to be so much sought after
and used in the community. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That is true, and the effect is just
passed by word of mouth and everybody wants to try it. </p>

<p><b>MR. WOODRUFF: </b>Have you put into the record a statement
showing the names of the different states in which this drug
plant is grown? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It is grown in practically all states. I
have a statement in reference to the seizures, which I will put
in the record. </p>

<p><b>MR. THOMPSON: </b>I would like to know whether or not these
marihuana cigarettes move through legitimate channels. Are there
manufacturing concerns that make them, or are they rolled in the
kitchens and cellars like illicit liquor used to be made? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> It is 100 percent illicit. </p>

<p><b>MR. THOMPSON:</b> No concerns make it legitimately? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> No, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> As a matter of fact, I understand they
found that some were grown in one of our Federal prisons. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> They found some marihuana growing in one
of the prisons. We heard of that. </p>

<p>There was a seizure made in the Colorado State Reformatory for
boys not long ago. </p>

<p><b>MR. MCCORMACK:</b> Was there not one made at San Quentin? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> Yes, sir. </p>

<p><b>MR. BUCK.</b> Mr. Hester testified that there were about
11,000 acres in cultivation in the country. Is that legitimate
cultivation? </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> That would be legitimate cultivation.
Dr. Dewey of the Department of Agriculture can give you that
exact information. </p>

<p><b>MR. REED: </b>Mr. Anslinger, you have been interrupted in
your statement from time to time, and I am wondering if you have
not some statement that would give the general information to the
committee on this subject which you might like to put in the
record. </p>

<p><b>MR. ANSLINGER:</b> I would like to put in the record the
statement of the district attorney that I referred to. I also
have a statement showing the seizures of marihuana during the
calendar year 1936 in the various states. </p>

<p><b>THE CHAIRMAN:</b> Without objection, you may extend your
statement in the record by inserting such information as you
think would be helpful to the committee.</p>

<p>Transcripts of Congressional Hearings </p>

<p><b>ADDITIONAL STATEMENT OF H. J. ANSLINGER, COMMISSIONER OF
NARCOTICS</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(The following statements were submitted by Mr. Anslinger) </p>

<p><b>ORIGIN</b> </p>

<p>The origin of this drug is very ancient. In the year 1090
A.D., the religious and military order or sect of the Assassins
was founded in Persia and the numerous acts of cruelty of this
sect were known not only in Asia, but in Europe as well. This
branch of the Shiite sect, known as Ismalites, was called
Hashishan, derived from hashish, of the confection of hemp leaves
&quot;marihuana&quot;. In fact, from the Arabic Hasishan we have
the English word &quot;assassin.&quot; </p>

<p>The plant was known by the Greeks as &quot;nepenthe&quot; and
was lauded in the immortal Odyssey of Homer. It was known in
ancient times to the Egyptians, and its use in Egypt at the
present time is widespread. Its effect upon the Malays has been
terrific and the natives of the Malay Peninsula have been known,
while under its influence, to rush out and engage in violent and
bloody deeds, with complete disregard for their personal safety,
of the odds arrayed against them. to run &quot;amok&quot; in the
Malay Peninsula is synonomous with saying one is under the
influence of this drug. </p>

<p><b>DESCRIPTION:</b> </p>

<p>Indian hemp is a rough, annual plant, and grows to varying
heights, from about 3 to 16 feet. Its stem is erect, branching
and angular; the leaves are alternate or opposite and coarsely
serrated. Marihuana is the same as Indian hemp, hashish,
cannabin, cannabis Americana, or cannabis sativa. Marihuana is
the Mexican term for cannabis indica. In the argot of he
underworld it has colloquial, colorful names such as reefer,
muggles, Indian hay, hot hay, and weed. The drug is known in many
countries by a variety of different names. In India it is known
as bhang and ganja; as dagga in Africa. </p>

<p>the term &quot;cannabis&quot; in the Geneva Convention of 1925
and in the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act included only the dried
flowering or fruiting tops of the pistillate plant as the source
of the dangerous resin. Research during the past few months shows
conclusively that this definition is insufficient, as we have
found by experiment that the leaves of the pistillate plant as
well as the leaves of the staminate plant contain the active
principal up to 50 percent of the U.S.P. strength. Accordingly,
we are urging the several states to revise their definition to
include all parts of the plant, as it now appears that the seeds
and portions other than the dried flowering tops contain
positively dangerous substances. We have been anticipating a
challenge of the old definition in the courts and only a few
weeks ago a defendant in a case in Florida in appealing to the
higher court of that State said: </p>

<p>&quot;We are of the opinion, therefore, that the information
was insufficient to clearly apprise the accused of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him because of the sale of
cigarettes containing cannabis from which the resin had not been
abstracted may relate to the resin of the staminate plant, the
resin of which appears to be harmless.&quot; </p>

<p>This challenge demonstrates the advisability of making our
definition all-inclusive, which has been done with respect to the
bill under discussion, H.R. 6385. </p>

<p><b>EFFECTS </b></p>

<p>The toxic effects produced by &quot;cannabin&quot;, the active
narcotic principal of the cannabis sativa, hemp, or marihuana,
appear to be exclusively to the higher nerve centers. The drug
produces first an exaltation with a feeling of well-being; a
happy, jovial mood, usually; and increased feeling of physical
strength and power; and a general euphoria is experienced.
Accompanying this exaltation is a stimulation of the imagination,
followed by a more-or-less delirious state characterized by vivid
kaleidoscopic visions, sometimes of a pleasing sensual kind, but
occasionally of a gruesome nature. Accompanying this delirious
state is a remarkable loss in spatial and time relations; persons
and things in the environment look small; time is interminable;
seconds seem like minutes and hours like days. Let us think, for
instance, of what might happen if a person under its influence
were driving a high-powered automobile. </p>

<p>Those who are habitually accustomed to use of the drug are
said to develop a delirious rage after its administration, during
which they are temporarily, at least, irresponsible and liable to
commit violent crimes. The prolonged use of this narcotic is said
to produce mental deterioration. It apparently releases
inhibitions of an antisocial nature whichh dwell within the
individual. </p>

<p>It is said that the Mohammedan leaders, opposing the
Crusaders, utilized the services of individuals addicted to the
use of hashish for secret murders. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that medical men and scientists have
disagreed upon the properties of marihuana, and some are inclined
to minimize the harmfulness of this drug, the records offer ample
evidence that it has a disastrous effect upon many of its users.
Recently we have received many reports showing the crimes of
violence committed by persons while under the influence of
marihuana. </p>

<p>The effect of the use of the drug depends largely upon the
individual. Among some people the dreams produced are usually of
an erotic character, but the principal effect is on the mind
which seems to lose the power of directing and controlling its
thoughts. Then follow errors of sense, false convictions and the
predominance of extravagant ideas where all sense of value seems
to disappear. </p>

<p>The deleterious, even vicious, qualities of the drug render it
highly dangerous to the mind and body upon which it operates to
destroy the will, cause one to lose the power of connected
thought, producing imaginary delectable situations and gradually
weakening the physical powers. Its use frequently leads to
insanity. </p>

<p>I have statement here, giving an outline off cases reported to
the Bureau or in the press, wherein the use of marihuana is
connected with revolting crimes. </p>

<p><b>EXTENT OF TRAFFIC</b> </p>

<p>The rapid development of a widespread traffic in marihuana
during the past several years, particularly during 1935 and 1936
is a matte of grave national concern. About ten years ago there
was little traffic in marihuana except in parts of the Southwest.
The weed now grows wild in almost every state in the Union, is
easily obtainable, and has come to be widely abused in many
states. The situation is especially fraught with danger because
this drug is being carried as a new habit to circles which
heretofore have not been contaminated. Incomplete reports that
have come to my attention during the past year on marihuana
seizures effected throughout the country by state authorities
show the existence of a dangerous and rapidly increasing traffic
in this drug in at least 29 states. </p>

<p>(Included Table - Page 30) </p>

<p>Three hundred and thirty-eight arrests for violations during
1936, but this by no means represents extent of traffic, because
not many of the states have actually begun real enforcement as
against marijuana -- many of the states lack special enforcement
facilities and require education of their enforcement officers in
the detection and prevention of marihuana traffic, especially in
identifying the drug. </p>

<p><b>STATE LAWS</b> </p>

<p>All of the states now have some type of legislation directed
against the traffic in marihuana for improper purposes. There is
no legislation in effect with respect to the District of Columbia
dealing directly with marihuana traffic. There is unfortunately a
loophole in much of this state legislation because of a too
narrow definition of the term. Few of the states have a special
narcotic law enforcement agency and, speaking generally,
considerable training of the regular polce officers of the states
will be required together with increased enforcement facilities
before a reasonable measure of effectiveness under the state laws
can be achieved. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE NEED FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION</b> </p>

<p>Even in states which have legislation controlling in some
degree the marihuana traffic, public officials, private citizens,
and the press have urged or suggested the need for national
legislation dealing with this important problem. A partial list
of states wherein officials or the press have urged the need for
Federal legislation on the subject are Colorado, Kansas, New
Mexico, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. </p>

<p>The uniform state narcotic law has now been adopted by some 35
states, many of these including cannabis or marihuana within the
scope of control by that law. However, it has been recently
learned that the legislative definition of cannabis in most of
these laws is too narrow, and it will be necessary to have the
definition amplified in amendatory legislation in most of the
states, to accord with the definition in the pending Federal
bill. As is the case at present with respect to opium, coca
leaves, and their respective alkaloids, the uniform state law
does not completely solve the enforcement problem with respect to
marihuana but it will provide the necessary supplement to the
Federal act and permit cooperation of state an Federal forces,
each acting within its respective sphere, toward suppression of
traffic for abusive use, no matter in what form the traffic is
conducted. The Bureau of Narcotics, under the Marihuana Taxing
Act, would continue to act as an informal coordinating agency in
the enforcement of the uniform state law, exchanging information
as between the respective state authorities in methods of
procedure and attempting to secure true uniformity in the
enforcement of the act in the various states which have adopted
it. </p>

<p><b>INTERNATIONAL EFFECT</b> </p>

<p>The United Sates is not a party to the Geneva Convention off
1925 which includes Indian hemp in the classes of drugs with
respect to which the convention operates. It is a party to the
Hague Convention of 1912 and the Manufacturing Limitation
Convention of 1931, under both of which it submits complete
reports of progress in enforcement to the League of Nations
(insofar as opium, coca leaves, and their alkaloids are
concerned.) The United States goes beyond the letter of its
obligations under the last-mentioned conventions in international
cooperation with respect to opium and coca leaves and their
alkaloids. It is only with respect to cannabis (marihuana) that
it cannot afford complete cooperation with other countries, since
it is obviously handicapped by the lack of national drug
legislation which would permit a reasonable degree of control
over this drug and afford a direct means of information
concerning the trend of the traffic. The United States has more
than kept pace with other world powers in the united battle
against the opium, morphine, and cocaine traffic; it continues to
fall behind in the international movement directed against the
use of marihuana. The importation and exportation of marihuana,
with respect to the United States is practically unrestricted,
and on once occasion the attention of the Bureau was called to an
excess exportation of cannabis, by one of our exporters, to
England, When the British governmental agency called attention to
this exportation of a quantity from the United States in excess
of the British import certificate, we were in the humiliating
position of informing it that our laws did not cover cannabis,
and remedial action had to be limited to a warning to the
exporter -- not that he was violating a law of the United States,
but an admonition that he would please refrain from violating the
British laws. </p>

<p>Alamosa Daily Courier </p>

<p>Alamosa, Colorado, September 4, 1936 </p>

<p>United States Treasury Department </p>

<p>Bureau of Narcotics </p>

<p>Gentlemen: Two weeks ago a sex-mad degenerate, named Lee
Fernandez, brutally attacked a young Alamosa girl. He was
convicted of assault with intent to rape and sentenced to 10 to
14 years in the state penitentiary. Police officers here know
definitely that Fernandez was under the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>But this case is one in hundreds of murders, rapes, petty
crimes, insanity that has occurred in southern Colorado in recent
years. </p>

<p>The laws of this state make the first offense of using,
growing, or selling marihuana a mere misdemeanor. The second
offense constitutes a felony. </p>

<p>Indian hemp grows wild within the limits of this city. It is
clandestinely planted in practically every county in this
section. Its use amounts to a near traffic in drugs. </p>

<p>The people and officials here want to know why something can't
be done about marihuana. The sheriff, district attorney, and city
police are making every effort to destroy this menace. Our paper
is carrying on an educational campaign to describe the weed and
tell of its horrible effects. </p>

<p>Your bulletins on traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs
state that the production and use of Indian hemp are not
prohibited by Federal law. Why? </p>

<p>Is there any assistance your Bureau can give us in handling
this drug? Can you suggest campaigns? Can you enlarge your
Department to deal with marihuana? Can you do anything to help
us? </p>

<p>I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigaret can do
to one of our degenerate Spanish-speaking residents. That's why
our problem is so great; the greatest percentage of our
population is composed of Spanish-speaking persons, most of who
are low mentally, because of social and racial conditions. </p>

<p>While marihuana has figured in the greater number of crimes in
the past few years, officials fear it, not for what it has done,
but for what it is capable of doing. They want to check it before
an outbreak does occur. Did you read of the Drain murder case in
Pueblo recently? Marihuana is believed to have been used by one
of the bloody murderers. </p>

<p>Through representatives of civic leaders and law officers of
the San Luis Valley, I have been asked to write to you for help.
Any help you can give us will be most heartily appreciated. </p>

<p>Very sincerely yours, </p>

<p>Floyd K. Baskette </p>

<p>City Editor, The Alamosa Daily Courier </p>

<p><b>MARIHUANA - A MORE ALARMING MENACE TO SOCIETY THAN ALL
OTHER HABIT-FORMING DRUGS</b> </p>

<p>(By Dr. Frank R. Gomila, commissioner of public safety, and
Miss Madeline C. Gomila, assistant city chemist) </p>

<p>Many papers have been written on the effects, physical and
mental, of the marihuana weed. Some of the best descriptions that
we have read can be found in Bromberg's (1) paper called
Marihuana Intoxication; Bragman's (2) Toxic Effects - Weed of
Insanity; and Kingman's (3) Green Goddess. But talking and
writing of the various results that ensue from constant use of
this weed in no way impresses the reading public with the
seriousness of the problem that faces it today. </p>

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a paper as
this will be presented. After searching the literature thoroughly
we could find no complete record of the situation in this
country. We have not deluded ourselves into believing that the
information compiled her is in any way a complete record of the
situation, but we do believe that it is the best that can be
obtained. The difficulty encountered is that any drug addiction
is such a secretive affair that not even the authorities in
charge know all the culprits. Also, we have encountered some
rather unexpected reluctance on the part of some of the state
authorities to furnish the information. The large gaps in the
table that we compiled are due to this lack of information. </p>

<p>Referring to Table 1, we find that 46 out of 48 states, or 94
percent, have found it necessary to pass some legislation against
the use, possession, and sale of this menacing weed. the urgent
reason for all these laws was that in many states the discovery
was made that scores of youngsters of high school age had become
victims of the weed. It was only last year that the St. Louis
Star Times in a series of newspaper articles, led the people of
Missouri in a stirring fight for the passage of a state law for
the protection of their children. Quoting from the St. Louis
Start-Times of February 4, 1935, we read: &quot;Those acquainted
with the traffic say there are more women smokers than men. If
you are a 'right guy' a 'giggle smoke' is available in places of
lenient morals and may be purchased from a 'bystander' in many of
the cheaper downtown resorts. </p>

<p>&quot;One gentleman of the byways explained, 'The worst thing
about that loco weed is the way these kids go for them. Most of
them, boys and girls, are just punks and when they get high on
the stuff you can write your own ticker.'&quot; (4) </p>

<p>The article goes on to tell how, when the number of muggle
smokers increased, marihuana dives came into existence. Here is a
description, &quot;The windows were covered with blankets and a
single electric bulb flickers through smoke so dense you can
barely see across the room. A dozen person around a penny-ante
poker game. They range from boys of 16 to men in their late 20's,
all in a state of dazed exhilaration. </p>

<p>&quot;There are only a few rickety charis and the table for
furnishings and the gang lolls about the room, some chasing cheap
whisky with long muggles drags, others content to smoke, laugh
vacuously and 'walk on air.'&quot; (5) </p>

<p>Still quoting from the St. Louis Star-Times of an earlier date
we find the case of a young high school student reported. &quot;A
case in point is that of a young man, an intelligent high school
student, now confined to an institution for the mentally
diseased. His experience is entirely the result of acquiring the
habit of smoking marihuana cigarettes. </p>

<p>&quot;One of his friends said to a Star-Times reporter,
calling the youth by name, 'He was a swell fellow until marihuana
got him. Like the rest of us, he thought the weed wasn't
habit-forming and had no idea of the possible consequences of
smoking it. He smoked so many he couldn't quit. finally he went
crazy and his folks put him in a sanitarium.'&quot; (6) From this
same article we read: &quot;'Weed' smoking among young St.
Louisians appears to be chiefly confined to boys. Girls who
indulge do so largely as a result of association with boys who
smoke the drug.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A girl student, still in her teens told a reporter she
had seen some of her friends under the influence and named a boy
and a girl who lost their senses so completely after smoking
marihuana that they eloped and were married. </p>

<p>&quot;'Another boy I know got the habit so bad he didn't have
enough money to buy all the cigarettes he craved. To get the
money he stole jewelry from his mother while under the influence
of marihuana and pawned it. He was arrested, but when his mother
found out who the thief was she naturally dropped her complaint. </p>

<p>&quot;'I know at least 20 boys, some of them in school, whom I
have seen smoking marihuana cigarettes. Sometimes three or four
of them crowd into a telephone booth and puff on a single
cigarette. </p>

<p>&quot;'Several girls I know have smoked marihuana and I smoked
with them, but I've decided its bad business and haven't smoked
lately. </p>

<p>&quot;'Sometimes we would go to a beer tavern and smoke, the
boys always supplying the muggles.'&quot; </p>

<p>Referring to table II, we find then that Colorado reports that
the Mexican population there cultivates on an average of 2 to 3
tons of the weed annually. This the Mexicans make into
cigarettes, which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white
high school students. Strangely enough, it has been noted that
when this weed is grown at altitudes considerably higher than sea
level, it is much more potent. Colorado, a state that has an
average altitude than sea level (sic), can therefore grow a plant
that is much more powerful than one grown in Louisiana. (8) </p>

<p>From Massachusetts we learn that cigarettes sell for 25 cents
apiece and that they are chiefly used among the younger people
between the ages of 18 and 21. In Louisiana the age range is
18-37 years. Minnesota, like Missouri, has its difficulties with
high school addicts. Oklahoma is another of the afflicted
states,. Reports state that the weed is used widely among the
high school students there. </p>

<p>The tragic picture of all these youngsters coming under the
influence of the drug certainly must have some significance. It
means that more drastic action is necessary. All these states
have passed laws concerning this drug but though the law has
curbed the use of marihuana to a certain degree it has by no
means eradicated it. This is still a very important problem. Why
shouldn't our Federal government, with its wheels of action
already set in motion, take over the control of the use of this
dangerous drug in the United States? We said &quot;wheels of
action, already set in motion&quot;, because in many large cities
the Federal narcotic squads are cooperating with the local police
in stamping out the danger threatened by this drug. The states,
individually, are doing what they can, though in many instances
they are sorely handicapped by lack of experience with this
problem, insufficient funds and ignorance of the proper methods.
Referring to Table 1, again, we find that the narcotic squad is
even now helping curb this menace in Louisiana, Maryland, New
York, New Jersey, and Wyoming. </p>

<p>In New Orleans we were called in a case in which Federal
narcotics agents had made the wholesale arrests of 36 peddlers
simultaneously. This is just one case out of many handled by the
Federal men this year. These men are more thoroughly trained and
much better equipped to handle the situation than the local
police. Certainly our government could help out in this
deplorable situation by amending the Harrison Narcotic Act to
include marihuana as a potent and dangerous drug. As long ago as
1931 our country was one among 57 other countries that met at
Geneva Switzerland, in order to draw up a treaty convention for
restricting the manufacture and cultivation of narcotic drugs.
Included among the narcotics listed by this treaty convention is
marihuana. by the end of the year 1935, 55 nations had ratified
this convention, the United States being the second nation to do
so in 1932. Why then should our Government ratify this treaty
convention and not include marihuana in our own Harrison Narcotic
Act(11)? </p>

<p>The increasing prevalence of this menace is another matter for
serious thought. From Table 1, we find that eight states enacted
legislation against the use, sale, and possession of this weed in
1935 and 1936. by glancing over Table II you'll find that New
York State alone destroyed 187 tons of the weed in 1935. There
seems to be no shortage there. In Louisiana, in recent months,
the state police have destroyed more weed here than every before.
there are many states in a similar dilemma. This problem seems in
no way to be solved butt on the contrary is growing to be a more
dangerous one every day. </p>

<p>From table II we ascertain that out of 450 persons arrested in
New Orleans, La. in 1934, 125 were marihuana addicts; out of 37
murders 177 were addicted to the use of marihuana, and out of 193
convicted of thefts, 34 were under the influence of this drug.
Therefore, the ratio is that approximately 1 out of every 4
persons arrested in this city has become a victim of this
dangerous drug. (12) </p>

<p>In the state of New Mexico, 4 percent of the inmates of the
penitentiary are confessed users of the weed. In New York we find
that ten percent of all the narcotic violators are marihuana
cases. The warden of the state penitentiary in North Dakota
reports that some of the prisoners are addicted to the drug but
that there are none there at present. In Minnesota 10 out of 348
cases at the reformatory confessed to being addicts, while in
Mississippi 6 confessed users were arrested. Illinois reports
having arrested 30 marihuana addicts since 1933. </p>

<p>In the case of the city of New Orleans, if we refer to table
III for the year 1936, we find that in the first 4 months of that
year 36 arrests were made. This number does not include the
arrests made by the Federal narcotics men which greatly exceeds
this figure. If we consider this figure 36 as an average figure
for that period we find that the total number of arrests for the
year of 1936 will substantially exceed the total for any one of
the preceding years. This is a significant fact and proves that
the danger is growing instead of abating. </p>

<p>Practically every article written on the effects of the
marihuana weed will tell of deeds committed without the knowledge
of the culprit, while he was under the influence of this drug.
There are many arguments for and against this statement, and many
cases reported which uphold it, and still others which contradict
it. Our opinion is that both arguments for and against are
correct because of the inconsistency of the action of this drug
on individual victims. The reactions resulting depend to a large
extent on the innate characteristics of the individual. The
person who is so unfortunate as to come under the influence of
this drug, in many cases, becomes the unwilling offender of the
law because the central nervous system has become affected, as is
the case with other habit-forming drugs. As a representative
case, note the tragic predicament of this Californian. &quot;A
man under the influence of marihuana actually decapitated his
best friend; and thn, coming out of the effects of the drug, was
as horrified aas anyone over what he had done&quot; (9). Then we
have the case of a young boy in Florida. The story runs as
follows: &quot;A young boy who had become addicted to smoking
marihuana cigarettes, in a fit of frenzy because, as he stated
while still under the marihuana influence, a number of people
were trying to cut off his arms and legs, seized an axe and
killed his father, mother, two brothers and a sister, wiping out
the entire family except himself.&quot; (10) </p>

<p>Those of us who are native New Orleanians must well remember
the tragic incident that happened in our city last year. In a
downtown section a man under the influence of the weed became so
frenzied and angered at his wife as to kill her out on the street
in front of many witnesses. </p>

<p>These are only three cases of which there are hundreds. Each
one is a blot on the history of the State where the crime was
committed and so it is very difficult to unearth such
information. </p>

<p>Is marihuana sufficiently like any other habit-forming drug
that it should receive recognition as a real menace? For an
answer we have only to glance over table IV, where we find that
in comparison with other habit-forming drugs, heroin, morphine,
opium, and cocaine, marihuana has an established place. Like
these drugs named, it , too, derives it effects chiefly from
resultant changes to the central nervous system. It decreases
pain and in certain instances dispenses it completely. Comparable
to the other drugs mentioned, a certain amount of tolerance is
set up rather easily with marihuana. </p>

<p>In its action of depression and stimulation it is very much
like that noted under small doses of morphine. Habit-forming
drugs in ever case disturb the vision and heart. In this instance
marihuana reacts like cocaine, in that the pupils become dilated
and the pulse is accelerated. Habitual use of heroin weakens
judgment, self-control, and attention. IN this sense, marihuana
is like heroin as constant use results in loss of judgment and
measurement of time and space. Marihuana makes the imagination
run rampant and the dreams that result are as extravagant as
those reported by opium eaters. Social dangers that ensue from
the use of marihuana are comparable to those that result from
heroin. The heroin habit produces an utter disregard for
conventions and moral; similar results ensue from the smoking of
the weed. Here, however, the skeptic has a point which he can
dispute. The action of marihuana is much less constant than
heroin, as it depends to a certain extent on the disposition and
intellectual activity of the victim. However, we must remind
friend skeptic that the great majority of users are ignorant and
inexperienced youngsters and members of the lowest strata of
humanity. When you think this fact over there should be no room
for argument on that point. </p>

<p>After an exhaustive search on marihuana from its earliest
history to the present time, it is easy to see that the
destruction of the plant is absolutely essential in all
communities in this country. To this end we believe that the
members of the Orleans Parish Medical Society should lend their
wholehearted cooperation. </p>

<p>In conclusion we wish to state that we have proved
conclusively: </p>

<p>1. The seriousness of the problem as it concerns youngsters
who are willing to take a chance at all times. </p>

<p>2. The increasing prevalence of this menace which results in a
large percentage of criminal users. </p>

<p>3. The tragedy of persons who use the weed becoming unwilling
offenders of the law because the central nervous system has been
so affected. </p>

<p><b>MARIHUANA AS A DEVELOPER OF CRIMINALS</b> </p>

<p>(By Eugene Stanley, district attorney, parish of Orleans, New
Orleans, La.) </p>

<p>Many prosecuting attorneys in the South and Southwest have
been confronted with the defense that, at the time of the
commission of the criminal act, the defendant was irresponsible,
because he was under the influence of marihuana to such a degree
he was unable to appreciate the difference between right and
wrong, and was legally insane. A great deal of difficulty has
been experienced in rebutting this defense by the testimony of
psychiatrists, for, while some of these experts are conversant
with the nature and effect of this drug, it has been the
experience of the author that many psychiatrists know nothing
whatsoever of the effect of the drug. </p>

<p>This may be due to the fact that this drug has come into wide
use in certain parts of the South only within the last 10 years. </p>

<p>It is the purpose of this article to give a brief outline of
the nature and origin of this drug, the legislation enacted which
prohibits its sale and use, to recommend that this drug be placed
within the provisions of the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, and to
give a list of some of the works which may be consulted by any
persons interested in making a thorough study of the drug. </p>

<p><b>MARIHUANA IS THE MEXICAN TERM FOR CANNABIS INDICA.</b> </p>

<p>The plant or drug known as Cannabis indica, or marihuana, has
as its parent the plant known as Cannabis Sativa. </p>

<p>It is popularly known in India as Cannabis Indica,; in
America, as Cannabis americana; in Mexico as Cannabis mexicana,
or marihuana. </p>

<p>It is all the same drug, and is known in different countries
by different names. It is scientifically known as Cannabis
sativa, and is popularly called Cannabis americana, Cannabis
indica, or Cannabis mexicana, in accordance with the geographical
origin of the particular plant. </p>

<p>In the East it is known as charras, as gunga, as hasheesh, as
bhang, or siddi, and it is known by a variety of names in the
countries of continental Europe. </p>

<p>Cannabis sativa is an annual herb from the &quot;hemp&quot;
plant; it has angular, rough stems and deeply lobed leaves. </p>

<p>It is derived from the flowering tops of the female plant of
hemp grown in semi-tropical and temperate countries. It was once
thought that only the plant grown in India was active, but it has
been scientifically determined that the American specimen termed
&quot;marihuana&quot; or &quot;muggles&quot; is equal in potency
to the best weed of India. The plant is a moraceous herb. </p>

<p>In the South, amongst the Negroes, it is termed
&quot;mooter&quot;. </p>

<p>In India, where the plant is scientifically cultivated on a
wide scale for the drug obtained from it, the plants, when small,
are separated, the female plant being used exclusively for the
purpose of obtaining the drug. </p>

<p>In Mexico and in America, the plants are permitted to grow
together indiscriminately, without separating the male and female
plants, so that the potency of the female plant is lessened by
the admixture of the male element. </p>

<p>In semitropical climates, because of the fertility of the soil
and the ease with which hemp seed may be procured, the plant can
be easily cultivated, and prohibition of the actual cultivation
is rendered practically impossible. It resembles a weed, and has
been found growing in some of the back yards and lots of the
cities. the traffic in the plant , and the drug derived
therefrom, has been found to be considerable, particularly in the
South and Southwestern States. </p>

<p><b>CULTIVATION OF HEMP</b> </p>

<p>Hemp is cultivated all over the world; its culture probably
originated in China, from whence it spread. It is cultivated for
three purposes; For the fiber, out of which rope, twine, cloth,
and hats are made; for the seed, from which a rapidly drying oil
is obtained that is used in the arts and as a commercial
substitute for linseed oil; and for the narcotic contained in the
resin of the dried, flowering tops of the pistillate plant. The
seed is also sold as a constituent of commercial bird seed. </p>

<p>Hemp is grown in the New England Colonies for fiber used in
the making of homespun. It was also grown in the Virginia and
Pennsylvania Colonies and cultivated at an early date in the
settlements of Kentucky, from whence the industry spread to
Missouri. Hemp has been grown at various times in Illinois, near
Champagne; in the Kankakee River Valley, in Indiana;; in
southeastern Pennsylvania, and in Nebraska, Iowa, and California.
It is now abundant as a wild plant in many localities in Western
Missouri, Iowa, Southern Minnesota, and in the southwestern and
western states, where it is often found as a roadside weed. It is
not known when the plant was introduced into Mexico, and the
southwest, but probably along with the early Spanish settlements.
It was introduced into Chile in the 16th Century. </p>

<p>The early cultivation of hemp in the United States was of the
small European variety, but this has been replaced since 1857 by
the larger Chinese hemp. Practically all the seed for present-day
American hemp culture is grown in the Kentucky River Valley. </p>

<p><b>CANNABIS INDICA OR SATIVA</b> </p>

<p>Cannabis Sativa is designated as a &quot;narcotic&quot; in a
number of State laws. It is sometimes mentioned in the laws as
&quot;loco weed&quot; because of its inebriate effect upon men
and cattle; in others a &quot;marihuana&quot;, &quot;hemp&quot;,
or &quot;hashish&quot;; in fact, the drug is known by a wide
variety of names. </p>

<p>It is one of the several drugs included under the antinarcotic
laws of 17 States, namely Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico,
Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, Washington, Utah, Maine,
Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Iowa.
It is also prohibited under the laws of Mexico and England. </p>

<p>In a great many of the states where this legislation was
enacted, so widespread was the use of marihuana, and so terrific
the result, that grave emergencies were declared to exist which
justified the legislation taking effect immediately. </p>

<p>The restrictions respecting the smoking of &quot;hemp&quot;
are mentioned along with those restricting opium smoking. </p>

<p>Although the different forms of the plant have been described
under different botanical names, there are no essential
differences in any of the specific characteristics, and all
cultivated or wild hemp is now recognized as belonging to one
species - Cannabis sativa. </p>

<p><b>THE ORIGIN OF THE DRUG</b> </p>

<p>The origin of the drug is very ancient. </p>

<p>In the year 1090 A.D. the religious and military order or sect
of the Assassins was founded in Persia, and the numerous acts of
cruelty of this sect was known not only in Asia, but in Europe as
well. This branch of the Shiite sect, known as Ismalites, was
called Hashishan, derived from Hashish, or the confection of the
hemp leaves (Cannabis indica). </p>

<p>In fact, from the Arabic &quot;Hashishan&quot; we have the
English word &quot;Assassin&quot;. It is mentioned in the Arabian
Knights, and was known at the time of the Crusaders. It is known
to the Greeks as &quot;Nepenthe&quot;, and was lauded in the
immortal Odyssey of Homer as a drug to lull all pain and anger,
and to bring forgetfulness of all sorrow. </p>

<p>It was known in ancient times to the Egyptians, and its use in
Egypt, at the present time is widespread. </p>

<p>In fact, it is presently as widely used amongst the Egyptians,
and in the East, as opium is used by the Chinese, and alcohol by
the Americans and Europeans. Its effect upon the Malays has been
terrific, and the natives of the Malayan Peninsula have been
known, while under its influence, to rush out and engage in
violent or bloody deeds, with complete disregard for their
personal safety, or the odds arrayed against them. To run
&quot;amok&quot; in the Malayan Peninsula is synonymous with
saying one is under the influence of this drug. </p>

<p>In America, particularly in the South and Southwestern
portions of the United States, it is called marihuana. It is
popularly known amongst the criminal element as
&quot;muggles&quot;, or &quot;mooter&quot; and addicts are
commonly termed &quot;muggle heads.&quot; </p>

<p><b>THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF THE DRUG</b> </p>

<p>The flowering tops of the female plant are the source from
which the drug is obtained, and in American these flowering tops
are gathered and rolled into cigarettes and smoked, the smoke
being inhaled. </p>

<p>A favorite method of smoking these cigarettes is for a person
to draw into the mouth the smoke from one of these cigarettes and
to blow the smoke from the mouth against the cupped hands, and
then inhale the smoke. </p>

<p>In India, marihuana or &quot;muggles&quot; is mostly used in
&quot;ganja&quot; form, which is the Indian name for a mixture of
the stems, leaves, and flowering tops of the cultivate female
plants. It is smoked, as in America, in the form of cigarettes,
or in the pipe; its smell is typically offensive, and is easily
recognized by the initiated. </p>

<p>In Inida, Bhang, or siddi, are the Indian names for the
mixture of these dry leaves and capsules without stems, whether
male or female, cultivated, or in its wild state. It is the
cheapest and the weakest of all the preparations of hashish, and
is taken as tea. </p>

<p>In India, the resinous substance which exudes from the
flowering head of the female plant is called
&quot;chearris&quot;, and is either smoked or taken in pills or
in confections, or mixed with sugar or honey, and is commonly
sold amongst the bazaars of Egypt and the Far East. </p>

<p>In many respects, the action of cannabis sativa is similar to
that of alcohol or morphine. Its toxic effects are ecstasy,
merriment, uncontrollable laughter, self-satisfaction, bizarre
ideas lacking in continuity, and its results are extreme
hyperacidity, with occasional attacks of nausea and vomiting. It
has also been described as producing, in moderate doses, from a
mild intoxication to a dead drunk, a drowsy and semicomatose
condition, lapsing into a dreamy state, with a rapid flow of
ideas of a sexual nature and ending in a deep sleep, interrupted
by dreams. On awakening, there is a feeling of great dejection
and prostration. </p>

<p>Large doses produce excitement, delusions hallucinations,
rapid flow of ideas, a high state of ecstasy, psychomotor
activity with a tendency to willful damage and violence, and a
temporary amnesia of all that has transpired. In cases of
prolonged addiction, especially in the Malays, the somnolent
action of Cannabis indica is replaced with complete loss of
judgment and restraint, the same effects so frequently observed
in alcohol intoxication. </p>

<p>It is commonly used as an aphrodisiac, and its continued use
leads to impotency. This has been observed among the natives of
India. </p>

<p>It is an ideal drug to quickly cut off inhibitions. </p>

<p>At the time of the founding of the religious sect of the
&quot;Assassins&quot; in Persia, by Hassan Ben Sabbat, young men
whom the sheik desired to subjugate were given this drug, and
when under its influence, were taken, blindfolded, into the
garden of the sheik, where every pleasure which appealed to the
sense awaited them. </p>

<p>When complete indulgence in these pleasures were had, they
were taken from this garden, and so eager were they for a further
opportunity to use this drug and a repetition of these pleasures,
that they were under the complete domination of the sheik, who
alone knew the secret of this drug, and gladly followed his will,
even to the extent of sacrificing their lives is he commanded
them to do so, in order to further experience the pleasures to
which they had been initiated. </p>

<p>At the present time, the underworld has been quick to realize
the value of this drug in subjugating the will of human derelicts
to that of the master mind. Its use sweeps away all restraint,
and to its influence may be attributed many of our present day
crimes. </p>

<p>It has been the experience of the police and prosecuting
officials in the South that immediately before the commission of
many crimes the use of marihuana cigarettes has been indulged in
by many criminals, so as to relieve themselves from a sense of
natural restraint which might deter them from the commission of
these criminal acts, and to give them the false courage necessary
to commit the contemplated crime.<br>
</p>

<p>THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARD MARIHUANA<br>
</p>

<p>Indian hemp (marihuana) addicts were made eligible for
treatment in recent legislation enacted by the Seventieth
Congress, approved January 19, 1929, establishing narcotic farms
for the confinement and treatment of persons addicted to the use
of habit-forming narcotic drugs. </p>

<p>This legislation is somewhat unique in congressional
legislation, since Indian hemp is not classified as a
habit-forming drug or narcotic in other Federal narcotic laws. </p>

<p>Inasmuch as the harmful effects of the use of the drug is
becoming more widely known each day, and it has been classed as a
narcotic by the statutory laws of 17 American states, England,
and Mexico, and persons addicted to its use have been made
eligible for treatment in the United States narcotics farms, the
United States Government, unquestionably, will be compelled to
adopt a consistent attitude toward this drug, and include it in
the Harrison antinarcotic law, so as to give Federal aid to the
States in their effort to suppress a traffic as deadly and as
destructive to society as the traffic in the other forms of
narcotics now prohibited by the Harrison Act. </p>

<p>Answers to Marihuana Questionnaire </p>

<p>by </p>

<p>Dr. W. L. Treadway </p>

<p>Division of Mental Hygeine </p>

<p>Public Health Service<br>
</p>

<p>1. Cannabin. Contained in the resin produced by the female
pistillate plant of Indian hemp.<br>
</p>

<p>2. Cannabin is considered as the active principle. Any active
principle, may be curtailed by other substances which, in
themselves, are inert, or it may be enhanced, but I do not know
of any substance in hemp which activates Cannabinis regarded as
the active principle or substance. You may have a drug which has
a specific physiological action but that drug may be enhanced by
the addition of some other substance which, in itself, is
probably inert. For example, take calomel combined with soda --
you would enhance the action of the calomel by the presence of
that alkali.<br>
</p>

<p>3. It occurs largely in the resin that is found in the flowers
of the tops of the pistillate plant. It also occurs in small
quantities in the smaller leaves of the tops of the plant and,
possibly, to a slight extent, in the fresh or young stalk of the
plant.<br>
</p>

<p>4. In the seed.<br>
</p>

<p>5. I do not know. That would depend upon further
experimentation. I do not think it woud be practical, from a
commercial standpoint, to attempt to get any considerable yield
from any part of the plant other than the resin. It would involve
great technical knowledge to make it commercially possible in
terms of contraband trade. The small quantitiess in the leaves
and stalks would hardly be sufficient to warrant anyone going to
the trouble to get a satisfacgtory yield from it. In other words,
it may be technically possible but it would be impractical.<br>
</p>

<p>6. That is a moot point. I think it is most generally
accepted, however, that the resin from the female plant conains
the largest amount of Cannabin..<br>
</p>

<p>7. Yes. Top leavews and resin dried and kept for from a year
to eighteen months becomes practically inert. It loses the
strength rapidly. This is also true of the fluid extract of
Cannabis. It tends to become inert, or lose its physiological
strength. <br>
</p>

<p>8. Yes, if kept in dry storage for a long time it
deteriorates. <br>
</p>

<p>9. Hemp fiber has almost been replaced by cotton because it
can be produced cheaper (clothing, etc.) It is also cultured for
rope but has been replaced by Sesseli, of the Cactus family, and
Abacca fiber, grown in the Philippine Islands, both of which are
more desirable for rope and cheaper. Sesseli is the more
desirable of these two.<br>
</p>

<p>10. It is difficult to say whether the seed in its early
development or in its embryonic form, may be contaminated by the
presence of this resin. The resin acts as a medium for the
collection of pollen. The seed does not contain the active
principle of Cannabin. Theoretically, and from the standpoint of
tradition, hemp seed is included in bird seed -- probably because
of the idea that it did contaiin this resin and make the birds

<p>11. I suppose you could pinch off the tops of the plants but
it would have to be done two or three times for, after each
pruning, theyy would produce another series of buds. Like
chrysanthemums, after each pruning, they would probably make an
extra effort to produce more fruit and, while this pruning would
probably temporarily stop the production of ths deleterious
substance it woudl eventually enhance and increase it.<br>
</p>

<p>12. I do not know.<br>
</p>

<p>13. It has been employed since about 500 B.C. for its sedative
action. The principle pharmaceutiical product is the fluid
extract but it is very rarely used now in medicine because there
are so many more desirable hypnotics. It is used, however, as an
analgesic in corm plaster. From the standpoint of the
Pharmacopoeia, it has been in each revision, but in talking with
some of the men interested in the new revision they question
whether it is desirable to continue including it.<br>
</p>

<p>14. Cannabis Indica does not produce a dependence such as in
opium addiction. In opiium addiction there is a complete
dependence and when it is withdrawn there is actual physical pain
which is not the case witth Cannabis. Alcohol more nearly
produces the same effect as Cannabis in that there is an
excitement or ageneral feelingg of lifting of personality,
followed by a delirious stage, and a subsequent narcosis. There
is no dependence or increased tolerance such as in opium
addiction. Aas to the social or moral degradation associated with
Cannabis it probably belongs in the same category as alcohol. As
with alcohol, it may be taken a relatively long time without
social or emotional breakdown. Marihuana is habit-forming,
altthough not addicting, in the same sense as alcohol might be
with some people, or sugar, or coffee. Marihuana produces a
delerium with a frenzy which might result in violence; but this
is also true of alcohol.<br>

<h1>Additional Statement of Clinton M. Hester</h1>

<p>Taxation of Marihuana<br>
Wednesday, April 28, 1937<br>
<br>
House of Representatives<br>
Comittee on Ways and Means<br>
Washington, DC<br>
<br>
Additional Statement of Clinton M. Hester, Assistant General
Counsel, Office of General Counsel for the Department of the
Treasury.<br>
<br>
MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, I prepared last evening a brief summary
of the effect of the marihuana bill upon legitimate industry
which I thought would be of interest to the committee.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: If there is no objection, the statement referred
to will be inserted in the record.</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: The statement I have referred to is as follows</p>

<p>All legitimate users of marihuana are exempted from the
provisions of this bill which imposes taxes upon transfers of
marihuana and require such transfers to be made on order forms
obtained from the collector of internal revenue, except
purchasers of marihuana seeds for use in the making of bird seed,
or marihuana seeds as bird see, and purchasers of the flowering
tops and leaves of marihuana for use in the making of the refined
drug product.</p>

<p>These legitimate users of marihuana who are exempted from
these transfer taces and order form requirements, are purchasers
of the mature stalk of marihuana for use in the making of fiber
products such as twine, purchasers of marihuana seed for the
further planting of marihuana and the manufacture of oil, and
purchasers of such oil for use in the manufacture of paints and
varnishes.</p>

<p>Although all of the above manufacturers or dealers who use
marihuana are exempted from the transfer tax and order form
provisions of the bill (with exceptions noted), they are,
nevertheless, required to pay occupational taxes and register
with the collector of internal revenue, with two exception:
Dealers in paintt and varnish which contains marihuana; and
manufacturers of and dealers in fiber products manufacturedd from
the mature stock of marihuana. Likewise, all producers of
marihuna, whether they grow marihuana for hemp fiber, for seeds,
orr for the drug, must register as producers and pay the
occuptational tax.</p>

<p>I. Hemp. Since the definition of marihuana in the bill
excludes the mature stalk of the plant and any product or
manufacgture of such stalk such as twine, all hemp, fiber, or
cordage manufacturers and dealers would not be subject to any
provision of the bill. It is possible too safely exclude all such
persons from the purview of the bill because the mature stalk
does not contain any of the harmful drug ingredient. However, any
person who gros marihuana, even if for the sole purpose of slae
to a hemp manufacturer, would have to pay an occupations tac as a
producer. the reason for this is that such production cannot be
limited to the mature stalks of such plant since the stalk cannot
be grown without also producing the flowering tops and leaves.
Unles the legitimate producer transfers the tops and leaves to a
drug manufacgturere, his product will not be subject to a
transfer tax for the flowering tops and leaves are removed from
the mature stalk and left on the field.</p>

<p>II. Marihuana seed for planting purposes. - All persons whho
produce marihuana for seeds must pay the occupational tax as
producers, but all transfers of marihuana seeds to persons
registered as producers for use by such persons for the further
production of marihuana are exempted from the transfer tax and
order form provisions of the bill.</p>

<p>III. Marihuana as used in the pain and varnish industry.</p>

<p>It appears that there is some use of marihuana seeds for the
production of oil which is sold to paintt and varnish
manufacturers, to be used as a constituent of their products. The
bill requires manufacturers and importers of oil, paint, and
varnish dealers in oil, to pay occupational taxes but exempts
from occupational taxes dealers in paints or varnishes.</p>

<p>The reason why manufacturers and importers must pay the
occupational tax and register is that they will have raw
marihuana in their possession and the reason why their products
are exempt is because the drug cannot be extracted from the
products. However, paiint and varnish and the oil to be used in
paint and varnish would be exempted from the transfer tax. Thus,
a transfer of seed from a marihuana producer to a registered oil
manufacturer would be exempted as would a transfer of the
manufactured oil to a registered paint manufacturer and a
transfer off the completed paint or varnish to a dealer or by a
dealer to the consumer.</p>

<p>IV. Marijuana for medicinal use. All persons who produce,
manufacture, import, or deal in marihuana, or its byproducts for
medical use, as well as practitioners, would be compelled by the
bill to pay occupational taxes. All transfers to manufacturing
chemists, druggists, and practitioners, woudl be sujbect to the
transfer tax and order form requirement but, such persons all
being entitled to reigstry, the transfer tax would amount to only
one dollar per ounce. the final dispensation by a practitioner to
a patient in the course off his professional practice or by
druggists to the patients of such practitioners in pursuance of a
written prescription would, howevver, be exempted from the
transfer tax and order form provisions. Incidentally, it appears
that the marihuana drug is not indispensable to the medical
profession.</p>

<p>V. Bird seed. Since marihuana bird seed contains the drug and
is capable of being used by human beings for smoking purposes,
and since, if negligently disposed of, itt propagates new
marihuana very rapidly, all occupaitional and transfer taxses
imposed by the bill are applicable with respect to bird seed
containing marihuana. Since the ultimate purchaser of th bird
seed could not register under the bill, a transfer to him would
be subject to the prohibitive $100 tax. thus the effect of the
bill is tto prevent the use of marihuana seed in bird seed.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Who is your next witness, Mr. Hester?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, I would like the committee now to
hear Dr. Munch, a pharmacologist, from Temple University,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Will you give the reporter your full name and the
position you occupy?</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. MUNCH, PHARMACOLOGIST, TEMPLE
UNIVERSITY, PHILADELPHA, PA.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Mr. Chairman, my name is Dr. James C. Munch; I am a
pharmacologist at Temple University, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Will you tell us about your education and
professional background?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I am a doctor of philosophy. I have majored in
toxicology (the action of poisons) and in pharmacology (the
action of drugs on animals and on man.)</p>

<p>I was for ten years connected with the Food and Drug
Administration, during part of which time I was in charge of the
pharmacology laboratory there. I am still a consulting
pharmacologist for the Bureau of Biological Survey of the United
States Department of Agriculture. I am also professor of
physiology and pharmacology in the School of Pharmacology, Temple
University, Philadelphia. I ws the drector of pharmacological
research for Sharp and Dohme; at present I am in charge of tests
and standards, John Wyeth &amp; Bros., Philadelphia Pa.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: You are a graduate of what college?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Of George Washington University.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: When?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: In 1924.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Are you connected with the Government in any
way?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I am consulting pharmacologist for the Bureau of
Biological Survey in the Department of Agriculture. I have also
been interested in the work of the Narcotics Bureau, particularly
in the detection of the doping of racehorses, and in subjects of
that type.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: That is a rather interesting study by itself.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I find it so.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: You may proceed with your statement.</p>

<p>Dr. MUNCH: In connection with my studies of Cananbis, or
marihuana, I have followed its effects on animals and also, so
far as possible, its effects upon humans. I find that the doses
which are capable of producing effects may be very nearly
poisonous doses; that is to say, small doses have little effect.</p>

<p>The effect is directed first at the hind bain, or the
cerebellum, leading to a disturbance of the equilibrium, so that
a man will go temporarily into a state resembling alcoholism.
Larger doses tend to depress the heart.</p>

<p>Continuous use will tend to cause the degeneration of one part
of the brain, that part that is useful for higher or physic
reasoning, of the memory. Functions of that type are localized in
the cerebral cortex of the brain. Those are the disturbing and
harmful effects that follow continued exposure to marihuana.</p>

<p>I have found the active material lodged in male plants as well
as female plants.</p>

<p>There are no chemical methods of standardization of this
variable drug.</p>

<p>In 1910, 1920, and 1930 the United States Pharmacopoeia
revision committee, the commttee that is charges with drafting
standards for drugs, considered those methods of standardizatioon
in great detail.</p>

<p>In 1910, the method of standardization by producing an effect
upon dogs was introduced as the official method of
standardization in an attempt to get a more uniform drug to use
in medicine.</p>

<p>First, small doses of thematieral to be standardized are
hgiven the dogs and then larger doses until we find the dose that
produce an effect. I have found in studying the action on dogs
that only abut 1 dog in 300 is very senistive to the text. The
effects on dogs are extremely variable, although they vary little
in their susceptibility. the same thign is true for other animals
and for humans.</p>

<p>MR. REED: Will you explain to the committee whether this drug
affecgts the nerves, or does it go directly into the blood
stream?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: It does not matter whether it is absorbed by
smoking or swallowing; it goes into the blood stream; it is
carried to the brain by the bloood and produces its effects in
the brain.</p>

<p>Animals which show a particular susceptibility, that is, which
show a response to a given dose, when they begin to show it will
acquire a tolerance. We have to give larger doses as the animals
are used over a period of 6 months or a year. This means that the
animal is becoming habituated, and finally the animal must be
discarded because it is no lobber serviceable.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: We are more concerned with human beings than
with animals. Of course, I realize that those experiments are
necessary and valuable, because so far as the effect is
concerned, they have a significance also. but we would like to
hve whatever evidence you have as to the conditions existing int
he country, as to what the effect is upon human beings. Not that
we are not concerned abou the animals, but the important matter
before us concenr the use of this drug by human beings.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I was making the point to show that in 1910 and in
1920 the Pharmacopeia accepted cannbis as one drug for use in
human medicine, and that that is the method of standardization,
because there was no other method by which this could be
standardized. </p>

<p>When we considered the material for the Pharmacopoeia in 1930
we found that this method of standardization was not useful. We
found that the Intenrational Committe on Standardization of Drugs
of the League of Nations had not admitted cannabis because it is
not used throughout the world.</p>

<p>Therefore, that method of standardization was discarded, and
so at this time the product which may be used is used without
being standardized. But the use of it is definitely decreasing,
as is shown by production statistics and surveys of prescription
ingredients.</p>

<p>MR. REED: You say the use is receding?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: It is disappearing; that is, its use in human
medicine is decreasing.</p>

<p>MR. REED: You do not wish to infer that it is decreasing in
use as a narcotic, do you?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Not at all. I am discussing the medicinal use.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: For what was it used?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I can only give you the literature. No physician
with whom I am immediately acquainted uses it at this time.</p>

<p>In the early days it was used in cases of sleeplessness and to
make your last moments on earth less painful when you were dying
from tetanus or rabies. There may be other uses, but I have not
found them.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: Is it ever used now for those purposes? I take it
there are several substitutes.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes; there are. So far as human beings are
concerned, we hve different types of treatment, such as the
Pasteur treatment.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: But you had the Pasteur treatment when you had
marihuana, did you not?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Not in human medicine.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: No, sir.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: How long have you had it?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Cannabis or marihuana was introduced into human
medicine by O&#146;Shaughnessey in 1838.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: When did Pasteur come on the scene?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: The Pasteur treatment was developed about 1875.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: Then you had the Pasteur treatment between the
period of 1875 until 1920?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: Did they use marihuana in that period for rabies?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Its use had been decreasing during that period.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: As I understood you, the use of marihuana was to
ease the last hours of a person in distress from excruciating
pain.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: I feel certain there are many substitutes that
could have been used before and can be used now for the purpose
for which marihuana, to some extent, was used.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes; That is true. Most of the modern drugs for the
annulment of pain have been developed since about 1880 or 1890.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Is it used in dentistry?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: It is one component of a prescription which has
been used from time to time in dentistry in assuaging pain, but
there again we have better drugs. At the time -------</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: (interposing) So it is not used very much today in
dentistry?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: That is my understanding. With the development of
drugs lik novocaine, its use in dentistry has been decreasing. </p>

<p>Its other use is in corn salves and corn plasters. Everyone
knows that they must be green and negative. Marihuana contains a
green component called chlorophyl. We have made experiments on
men as well as upon animals in which we have applied the material
directly through the skin, either normal skin containing a corn,
and we find that it has no value in preventing pain. Cannabis or
marihuana it self will not decrease the pain of a corn. Salicylic
acid causes the destruction of the corn tissue.</p>

<p>Cannabis is used because it has a green color, but other green
dyes will be just as effective as marihuana for this purpose.</p>

<p>On last Saturday a paper was presented before the
Pharmacological Society in Memphis, Tenn. by Dr. Walton, who has
been making a special study of cannabis at this time. He said the
the cannabis grown in the neighborhood of New Orleans for
pharmaceutical purposes was similar in chemical ingredients to
that which has been bought in India and elsewhere.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: I take it that the effect is different upon
different persons.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes. sir.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: There is no question but what this is a drug,
is there?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: None at all.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Is it a harmful drug?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Any drug that produces the degeneration of the
brain is harmful. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: I agree with you on that, but I want to ask you
these questions and have your answers for the record, because
they will assist us in passing upon this legislation.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I have said it is a harmful drug.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: In some cases does it not bring about extreme
inertia?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, it does.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: And in other cases it causes violent
irritability?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: And those results lead to a disntegration of
personality, do they not?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: That is really the net result of the use of
that drug, no matter what other effects there may be; its
continued use means the disintegration of the personality fo the
person who uses it?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, that is true.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Can you give us any idea as to the period of
continued use that occurs bbefore this disintegration takes
place?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: I can only speak from my knowledge of animals. In
some animals we see the effect after about 3 months, while in
others it requires more than a year, when they are given the same
dose.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Are there not some animlas on which it reacted,
as I understand it, in a manner similar to its reaction on human
bbeings? Is that right?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Have you experimented upon any animals whose
reaction to this drug would be similar to that of human beings?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: The reason we use dogs is because the reaction fo
the dogs to this drug closely resembles the reaction of human
beings.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: And the continued use of it, aas you have
observed the reaction on dogs, has results in the disintegration
of personality?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, so far as I can tell, not being a dog
psychologist, the effecgts will develop in from 3 months to a
year.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: The recognition of the effects of the usse of
this drug is not only of comparatively recent origin is it not?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, comparatively recent.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: I suppose one reason was that it was not used
very much.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: I understand this drug came in from, or was
originally grown in Mexico and Latin American countries.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: &quot;Marihuana&quot; is the name for Cannabis in
the Mexican Pharmacopoiea. It was originally grown in Asia.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: That was way back in the oriental days. The
word &quot;assassin&quot; is derived from an oriental word or
name by which the drug was called; is that not true?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Yes, sir.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: So it goes way back to those years when hashish
was just a species of the same class which is identified by the
English translation of an oriental word; that is, the word
&quot;assassin&quot;; is that right?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: That is my understanding.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Is there any knowledge or information as to the
growth of the use of marihuana cigarettes, or any other form of
the drug by hman being for drug purposes, in recent years?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: Mr. Young was formerly connected with the Bureau of
Plant Industry fo the Untied States Department of Agriculture. He
left the Bureau several years ago and started a plantation in the
neighobrhood of Florence, S.C. for the growth of marihuana for
medicinal purposes. It is my understanding that because of the
lack of commercial demand he has disconttinued that project after
two years. I am not certain but I think he stopped that in 1928
or 1929 because of the lack of demand.</p>

<p>If I may amplify that a little bit, let me say this: In 1932
and 1933 an ingredient survey was made, a study of the components
of 122,000 prescriptions. It was found that cannabis was
prescribed only four or five times per 10,000.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Can you give us any information about the
growth in recent years of the use of it as a drug in connection
with the purposes that this bill was introduced to meet?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: You mean the illicit use rather than the medicinal
use?</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Exactly.</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: The knowledge that I have in that connection is
based on contacts with police officers as they collected
material, even in Philadelphia. They tell me that until ten years
ago they had no knowledge of it, but that now it is growing wild
in a number of different places.</p>

<p>I was in Colorado about three years ago, gooingg there as a
witness in a prosecution brought under the Colorado act in
connection with the use of marihuana. The plice officers there
told me its use developed there only within the last three or
four years, starting about 1932 or 1933.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: Has there ben a rapid increase in the use of
marihuana for illicit purposes - and I use the word illicit to
describe the sitaution we have in mind?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: It is my understanding that there has been.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: There is no question about that, is there?</p>

<p>DR. MUNCH: No, sir, there is not.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: We thank you for the statemetn you have given to
the committee. Who is your next witness, Mr. Hester?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: I would like the committee now to hear Mr.

<p>STATEMENT OF HERBERT J. WOLLNER, CONSULTING CHEMIST, OFFICE OF
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Mr. Chairman, my name is Herbert J. Wollner; I am
consulting chemist in the office of the Secretary of the
Treasury.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: You may proceed.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: The acttive principle in marihuana appears to be
associated with an element which is located or found in the
flowering tops and on the under side of the leaves of the plant.
Until relatively recently the lack oof refined chemical tests has
built up the traditional conception that it was only found in the
co-called female plant. But that is untrue. We have discovered
that it is present both in the male and female plant.</p>

<p>To iluminate the matter I have brought with me some slides, if
you care to look at them through the lenses, which I will be glad
to submit for your examination.</p>

<p>(The slides referred to were examined by the members of the
committee.)</p>

<p>Those are the flowering tops, and the plant is covered with a
tremendous number of very fine hairs. You will notice that at the
base of these hairs are little pockets, liike apertures, where
little sacks of resin are located. The resin contains an
ingredient which the chemical technologist referes to as
cannabinone or cannabinol, alternatively. It is the invariant
experience that this material contains the active principle which
does the job.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: How do they get this into commercial use? I am
talking about the flowering plantt. Do they have to take it in
its natural state?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: There are a variety of ways. In the early days,
when they used hashish, they would jounce the flowering tops up
and down in bags and then the resin would collect on the surface
of the cloth and was scraped off and mixed with sweets and eath.
At the present time in reefers and muggles there is no
separation. They smoke the stuff in toto, the leaves, the
flowering tops, and everything.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: They use the whole thing?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes. In the laboratory we extract this resin and
then identify it.</p>

<p>MR. MCCORMACK: After that it is dried quicker?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes, It goes through a process which is simlar to
the process through which tobacco goes. They are similar in that
respect.</p>

<p>MR. REED: As to this ingredient at the root of this hairlike
substance, is that in the nature of oil?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: Yes and no. This active substance will be
extractible from the resin. It is on the border line between
resin and oil. If you raise the temperature slightly, it becomes
fluid.</p>

<p>The identification problems have been worked out very clearly
from the botanical and from the purely laborattory approach, and
that is in such shape right now that the transmission of that
information to police officers throughout the country would be
perfectly possible.</p>

<p>MR. CROWTHER: Is that the oil that the manufacgtureres used to
produce in considerable quantities?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That is a different oil. That oil derives its
source from the seed of the marihuana plant. The seed of hte
plant contains a drying oil which is in a general way similar to
that of linseed. Those seeds contain a small amount of that
resin, appparently on their outer surface according to quite a
number of investigators depending upon the age of that seed.</p>

<p>The oil in the seed or the seed itself only contains the
active principle, apparently, where derived from an immature
plant. However, cerain investigators have found active principles
in smaller amounts even in mature seeds.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: It has been testified that the common manner of
use is tthrough cigarettes. Is anyone manufacturing those
cigarettes for sale, or do you just roll them?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: As I understand it from our law-enforcment
officers, both procedures are in common usage.</p>

<p>It is also sold in the form of loose tobacco, either mized or
straight.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: Do you know of any concern that is manufacturing
cigarettes with the marihuana content?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would not know of such a concern in the course
of my own experience.</p>

<p>MR. VINSON: The addicts can roll their own?</p>

<p>MR. BUCK: Does the oil from the seed contain any of this
deleterious matter?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That would in a large measure depend upon the
condition of the seed and the condition of manufacture, bit I
would say in any event the oil would not contain a large amount
of this resin.</p>

<p>It may be that that quantity active principle which is in the
oil was derived through contact with other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>MR. BUCK: Would it contain enough to have any harmful effect
on anyone, if taken internally?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: I would say no; it would not contain such an
amount.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: As I understand it, you say the oil dos not
contain much, if any, of the drug?</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: It does contain some fo the drug, but not much.
It woudl appear, offhand, to be rather difficult to spearate, but
processes might possibly be developed for that purpose.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: It would not be useful for the purpose for which
they are using marihuana.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: No.</p>

<p>MR. FULLER: So, so far as the oil from the seed is concerned,
it is harmless, as far as human use is concerned.</p>

<p>MR. WOLLNER: That is right.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: We thank you for your statement.</p>

<p>Mr. Hester, who is your next witness?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Mr. Chairman, we have one other witness, Dr.
Dewey, who was formerly chief of the fiber investigation of the
Bureau of Plant Industry in the Department of Agriculture. He is
a botanist, and while he is noe in retirement, officials of the
Department of Agriculture have referred us to him as the foremost
expert on the botanical aspect of this plant.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: Is he now connected with the Department of
Agriculture?</p>

<p>MR. HESTER: No, he is not, he is now in retirement.</p>

<p>MR. CULLEN: We will be glad to hear Dr. Dewey. Will you give
your full name to the reporter?</p>

<h1>Statement of Clinton M. Hester, </h1>

<p><b>Assistant General Counsel, Treasury Department</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>MR. HESTER: The purpose, Mr. Chairman, of H.R. 6906 s to
employ the Federal taxing power to raise revenue by imposing
occupational and transfer taxes upon dealings in marihuana and to
discourage the widespread use of the drug by smokers and drug
addicts. </p>

<p>The flowering tops, leaves, and seeds of the hemp plant
contain a dangerous drug, known as marihuana. The drug is used
only to a negligible extent by the medical profession. In fact,
last year only 4 out of every 10,000 prescriptions contained
marihuana. The drug is prescribed as a sedative, but is used very
rarely by the medical profession because the effect of the drug
is so variable that a physician cannot tell how his patient will
react to the drug and because there are so many better
substitutes. </p>

<p>The plant also has many industrial uses. From the mature stalk
fiber is produced which in turn is manufactured into twine, and
other fiber products. From the seeds, oil is extracted which is
used in the manufacture of such products as paint, varnish,
linoleum, and soap. From hemseed cake, the residue of the seed
after the oil has been extracted, cattle feed and fertilizer are
manufactured. In addition, the seed is used as special feed for
pigeons. </p>

<p>Marihuana is often used illicitly by smoking it in crudely
prepared cigarettes which are readily procurable in almost all
parts of the country at prices ranging from 10 to 25 cents each.
Under the influence of this drug the will is destroyed and all
power of directing and controlling thought is lost. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Do you mean that the cigarettes cost 25 cents
each?<br>
MR. HESTER: They are manufactured illicitly and that is the price
that the peddlers actually get for them. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: That is per cigarette and not per package? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is per cigarette. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: For one cigarette? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>Inhibitions are released. As a result of these effects, many
violent crimes have been and are being committed by persons under
the influence of this drug. Not only is marihuana used by
hardened criminals to steel them to commit violent crimes, but is
also being placed in the hands of high-school children in the
form of marihuana cigarettes by unscrupulous peddlers. Its
continued use results many times in impotency and insanity. </p>

<p>Two objectives have dictated the form of H.R. 6906, first, the
development of a plan of taxation which will raise revenue and at
the same time render extremely difficult the acquisition of
marihuana by persons who desire it for illicit uses, and second,
the development of an adequate means off publicizing dealings in
marihuana in order to tax and control the traffic effectively. </p>

<p>This bill is modeled upon both the Harrison Narcotics Act and
the National Firearms Act, which were designed to accomplish
these same general objectives with respect to opium and coca
leaves, and firearms, respectively. </p>

<p>Under the provisions of this bill all legitimate handlers of
marihuana, are required to pay occupational taxes as follows:
Manufacturers, compounders, and importers, $24 per year;
producers, $5 per year; dealers, $3 per year; practitioners
(doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and other of like character),
and persons who use marihuana for experimental purposes, $1 per
year. These persons, in addition to paying the occupational tax,
must register with the collector of Internal Revenue and file
information returns as to their dealings in marihuana. </p>

<p>However, as an additional means of bringing the traffic in
marihuana into the open, the bill requires all transfers of
marihuana to be made in pursuance of the official order forms
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon which the details
of the transaction are set forth. In order to raise additional
revenue and to prevent transfers to persons who would use
marihuana for undesirable purposes, a transfer tax is imposed
upon each transfer of marihuana. Upon transfer to registered
persons, this tax is $1 per ounce, while, upon transfers to
non-registered persons, who under ordinary circumstances will be
the illicit users of marihuana, a heavy tax off $100 is imposed.
Heavy criminal penalties are provided for the manufacturing,
producing, or dealing in marihuana without registering and paying
the special taxes, for transferring marihuana not in pursuance of
an order form, and for acquiring marihuana without payment of the
transfer tax. </p>

<p>Thus, the bill is designed, through the occupational tax and
the order form procedure, to publicize legitimate dealings in
marihuana and through the $100 transfer tax to prevent the drug
from coming into the hands of those who will put it to illicit
uses. </p>

<p>The production and sale of hemp and its products for
industrial purposes will not be adversely affected by this bill.
In general, the term &quot;marihuana&quot; is defined in the bill
as to include only the flowering tops, leaves, and seeds of the
hemp plant, and to exclude the mature stalk, oil, and meal
obtained from the seeds of the plant, and sterilized seed,
incapable of germination. </p>

<p>Under this definition of &quot;marihuana&quot; the hemp
producer will pay a small occupational tax but his fiber products
will be entirely exempt from the provisions of the bill,
including the order form and transfer tax provisions. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: This means the farmer will pay $5? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is all he will have to pay? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is all he will have to pay. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: And it makes no difference how extensive his
acreage is? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: No, $5 is the limit. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It is $5 whether he cultivates an acre or 10
acres? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>The same is true of seed produced by the hemp grower for sale
for the further production of the plant, for the manufacture of
oil or for birdseed, except that such transfers will be made
subject to regulations designed to prevent diversion of the seed
for illegal purposes. </p>

<p>Similarly, the manufacturers of oil and the byproducts of
seed, such as hemp seed cake and meal, will pay an occupational
tax, but their purchases of seed and sales of such oil, cake, and
meal will be entirely exempt from the provisions of the bill
except that the purchasers of such seed will be subject to
regulation designed to prevent diversion. </p>

<p>Manufacturers of birdseed will also pay an occupational tax,
but their purchases of seed will be exempt from the transfer tax
and order form provisions of the bill, if carried out in
accordance with regulations. Further, under the definition of
marihuana, the bill will not apply to their sales of birdseed, if
the hemp seed contained therein is sterilized so as to be
incapable of germination. </p>

<p>I might say at this point that this provision with respect to
the birdseed was worked out with the birdseed people, and those
who appeared before the Ways and Means Committee approved that
provision. </p>

<p>Now, this is an important provision, this particular provision
right here that we are discussing. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding, as already shown, that under the bill the
producers of hemp will only pay a small occupational tax and make
their purchases and sales of seed subject to regulations, some
suggestion has been made that the producers be entirely
eliminated from the bill. Such an exemption, however, is believed
to be impossible. </p>

<p>The imposition of an occupational tax enables the Government
constitutionally to make it illegal to engage in the occupation
without payment of the tax. Thus, unless the Congress in this
bill imposes an occupational tax on the producer of the hemp,
Congress cannot make the production of hemp for illicit purposes
illegal. Hence, if the occupational tax is not imposed upon
producers, marihuana may be legally produced for illicit
purposes. Furthermore, the imposition of an occupational tax
enables the Government to require the taxpayer to furnish
information in connection with the business taxed. This would
permit the Government to ascertain where the legitimate
production of hemp is being carried on, and having this
information, it can stamp out the illicit production more
effectively. Obviously, therefore, the legitimate producers of
hemp cannot be further exempted from the provisions of the bill.
Otherwise, the bill cannot be enforced. </p>

<p>Aside from the reasons stated as to why it is believed to be
impossible to further exempt the producers of hemp from the
provisions of the bill, attention is invited to the fact that the
primary purpose of this legislation is to raise revenue. </p>

<p>That completes my statement, and we have witnesses present. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Do I understand you to say that the primary
purpose of the bill is to raise revenue? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: The primary purpose of this legislation must be to
raise revenue, because we are resorting to the taxing clause of
the Constitution and the rule is that if on the face of the fill
it appears to be a revenue bill, the courts will not inquire into
any other motives that the Congress may have had in enacting this
legislation. </p>

<p>This bill is modeled on the Harrison Narcotics Act and the
National Firearms Act. The Harrison Narcotics Act has been
sustained by the Supreme Court, the first time by a 5-to-4
decision, and a second time by a 6-to-3 decision. The Supreme
Court in March of this year sustained the constitutionality of
the National Firearms Act, insofar as it related to the
occupational tax. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: The Harrison Narcotics Act you say was before
the Supreme Court twice. Was there a change in the judges between
the time of the first decision and the time of the second
decision? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: I do not know whether there was a new judge placed
upon the bench at that time or not, but the vote was 6-to-3 the
second time. That was some years later. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: What was the date of the 6-to-3 decision? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: 1927 </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Justice Stone went on the Supreme Court at that
time? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: He went on the Court in the Coolidge
administration. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: That is right. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Yes, he was on. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: When was the first decision? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: The first decision was about 1918. I think it was
about that time. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Hester, will you give us a summary of the
history of the state legislation respecting marihuana? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Every state in the Union has legislation
regulating the traffic in marihuana. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is there fairly uniform law on the subject
among the states? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Yes, it is fairly uniform. In some states they
prohibit entirely all production of marihuana. I think there are
six states that prohibit the production of marihuana, and it
probably could be constitutionally done by the Congress. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is, there could be a prohibition? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. But you would have to prohibit it
entirely and of course you would put all of these legitimate
industries out of business. The Supreme Court has held that where
on the face of the act it appears to be a taxing measure, the
fact that it happens to be prohibitive in character will not
affect the constitutionality of it. But we have tried throughout
this measure not to interfere materially with the production of
marihuana, but to permit it, and to do it in a manner which will
enable the Government to stamp out this illicit traffic in the
sale of it. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Say you are in this situation: You have a plant
that produces several articles that are valuable commercially. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: At the same time, as a byproduct the leaves and
the seeds can be used for marihuana? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is the deleterious part of it. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is correct. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As Senator Davis suggests, I think it would be
valuable if you would summarize the state legislation, first
informing us as to what the fairly uniform general legislation is
upon the subject, and then giving us the names of the states that
have prohibited the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: May we present a memorandum for inclusion in the
record on that because we really do not have that at the moment? </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Yes. </p>

<p>(included table) </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: We have with us this morning Commissioner
Anslinger, of the Bureau of Narcotics, who is in charge of the
enforcement of the Harrison Narcotics Act, and who will have
charge of the enforcement of this act if this legislation be
enacted into law. He is prepared to testify on the necessity of
the legislation and the practical situations. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: All right. Thank you, Mr. Hester. We will hear
from Mr. Anslinger. </p>

<h1>STATEMENT OF H. J. ANSLINGER, </h1>

<p><b>COMMISSIONER OF NARCOTICS, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS OF THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT</b> </p>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" width="562" height="19">
</p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the
committee, we are having a great deal of difficulty. Last year
there were 338 seizures of marihuana in some 31 states involving
several hundred tons of growing plants, bulk marihuana, and
cigarettes. </p>

<p>The states are asking for our help. We are trying to give it
to them, but we are rather limited in our ability at the present
time. </p>

<p>I have made a statement before the Ways and Means Committee,
which is in the record, but since that time I want to point out
to the committee an incident which occurred on June 28, at
Abingdon, Va. There was a marihuana farm at that point, and the
man who was growing those plants had been connected with a family
that was engaged in smuggling narcotic drugs into Atlanta
penitentiary some years ago. When we heard Dewey Doss was engaged
in the production of marihuana, we went after him, and we got the
state officers to make a case against him. We could not do
anything about that, although the information came to us first. </p>

<p>A month or so ago, down in Texas, a man was arrested on a
Missouri Pacific train going north with a quantity of cannabis,
and another man was arrested in the vicinity of this place,
called Raymondsville, Texas. They had both stripped the plants on
a hemp farm. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You mean they had taken the leaves off? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: They had taken the leaves off and the flowering
tops. </p>

<p>I received this letter from an attorney at Houston, Texas,
just the other day. This case involves a murder in which he
alleges that his client, a boy 19 years old, had been addicted to
the use of marihuana. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Shall we read this into the record? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir; I shall be very glad if you will. </p>

<p>(The letter is as follows:) </p>

<p>Houston, Tex., July 7, 1937 </p>

<p>H. J. Anslinger </p>

<p>United States Commissioner of Narcotics </p>

<p>Washington, DC </p>

<p>Dear sir: </p>

<p>Your article on Marihuana appearing in the July issue of the
American is very useful as well as interesting. </p>

<p>this subject strikes close to home because of a client II have
who not so long ago murdered in a brutal way a man who had
befriended him in giving him a ride. This client is a boy 20
years of age and he explained to me he has been smoking marihuana
for several years. I would like to have about 1 copies of your
article and will gladly pay any necessary charges. I would
appreciate an early reply. </p>

<p>Yours Truly, </p>

<p>Sidney Benbow </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I have another letter from the prosecutor at a
place in New Jersey. </p>

<p>It is as follows: </p>

<p>The Interstate Commission on Crime </p>

<p>March 18, 1937 </p>

<p>Charles Schwarz, Washington, DC </p>

<p>My Dear Mr. Schwarz: </p>

<p>That I fully appreciate the need for action, you may judge
from the fact that last January I tried a murder case for several
days, of a particularly brutal character in which one colored
young man killed another, literally smashing his face and head to
a pulp, as the enclosed photograph demonstrates. One of the
defenses was that the defendant's intellect was so prostrated
from his smoking marihuana cigarettes that he did not know what
he was doing. The defendant was found guilty and sentenced to a
long term of years. I am convinced that marihuana had been
indulged in, that the smoking had occurred, and the brutality of
the murder was accounted for by the narcotic, though the
defendant's intellect had not been totally prostrate, so the
verdict was legally correct. It seems to me that this instance
might be of value to you in your campaign. </p>

<p>Sincerely yours, </p>

<p>Richard Hartshorne </p>

<p>Mr. Hartshorne is a member of the Interstate Commission on
Crime. We have many cases of this kind. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It affects them that way? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: (viewing a photograph presented by Mr.
Anslinger) Was there in this case a blood or skin disease caused
by marihuana? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: No; this is a photograph of the murdered man,
Senator. It shows the fury of the murderer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is terrible. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: That is one of the worst cases that has come to
my attention, and it is to show you its relation to crime that I
am putting those two letters in the record. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: The first letter is also very interesting. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: This first letter was from an attorney at
Houston. In June of this year, at Geneva, an international
committee of experts in going over the reports received from all
over the world said that the reports thus far indicate that the
medical value of cannabis derivatives is very doubtful. There is
another report here from Dr. Paul Nicholas Leech. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is, to make perfectly clear, its medical
value is not very great, and there are many other drugs that may
be used in place of it that are fully as good if not better? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir; it is not indispensable. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think some medical men say that if we had no
such drug at all the medical profession would not be very greatly
handicapped. That is, medical science would not be very greatly
handicapped. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I think they are pretty generally in agreement
that its use could be abandoned without any suffering. </p>

<p>I have a few cases here that I would like to tell the
committee about. In Alamosa, Colorado, they seem to be having a
lot of difficulty. The citizens petitioned Congress for help, in
addition to the help that is given them under state law. In
Kansas and New Mexico also we have had a great deal of trouble. </p>

<p>Here is a typical illustration: A 15-year-old boy, found
mentally deranged from smoking marihuana cigarettes, furnished
enough information to police officers to lead to the seizure of
15 pounds of marihuana. That was seized in a garage in an Ohio
town. These boys had been getting marihuana at a playground, and
the supervisors there had been peddling it to children, but they
got rather alarmed when they saw these boys were developing the
habit, and particularly when this boy began to go insane. </p>

<p>In Florida some years ago we had the case of a 20-year-old boy
who killed his brothers, a sister, and his parents while under
the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>Recently, in Ohio, there was a gang of very young men, all
under 20 years of age, every one of whom had confessed that they
had committed some 38 holdups while under the influence of the
drug. </p>

<p>In another place in Ohio, a young man shot the hotel clerk
while trying to hold him up. His defense was that he was under
the influence of marihuana. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: When a person smokes the cigarette, how long
does the influence of the drug continue? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: From reports coming to me, I think it might
last as long as 48 hours before the effects of the drug fully
wear off. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I do not know whether it was your article I
read, or an article from some other source, but I understand that
experiments have been conducted, in which the persons smoking the
marihuana have been kept under control after taking the drug. Do
you know whether or not that demonstrated how long the effect
would be felt? </p>

<p>MR. ANLSINGER: As I remember it, the effects in those cases
were something like 48 hours, before they fully returned to their
normal senses. </p>

<p>Here is a case in Baltimore, where a young man committed rape
while under the influence of marihuana. He was hanged for it.
Last fall, about September, we uncovered a field of several
acres, growing right outside the city limits of Baltimore. Those
men were selling it to New York, sending it all over the country,
at $20 a pound. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: And how many pounds to the acre? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: That would depend, Senator. If they just took
the flowering tops the yield would not be so big, but some of
them strip off the leaves and the flowering tops and grind them
up. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Do the leaves have the same effect as the
flowering tops? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir; one of the Treasury's chemists is
here who can verify that, sir. It has been proved by experts in
other countries who have analyzed the leaves. They find that the
resin is also present in the leaf. Our experiments have not shown
the presence of any drug in the mature stalks, though. A one time
we thought that the dangerous principle was only in the flowering
top, but that is not true. What led us to the study as to whether
there was resin in the leaves was the fact that we had seen so
much of this stuff rolled up. In some cases only the leaves had
been crushed, and they seemed to be giving the effect. In New
Mexico, officers sent us about 4 or 5 pounds of nothing but
leaves, and some of that particular shipment had been the cause
of the killing of a police officer, and also the killing of a man
within the ring. Every day we have such seizures, reports. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is the cigarette that is made form the
flowering top more potent than the one made from the leaves? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir, it would be, because the tops have
the resin concentrated. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Do I understand that the seed is ground up,
too. and used to any extent? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Well, we have heard of them smoking the seed.. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Does it produce the same effect? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I am not qualified to say. We have not made any
experiments as to that, but we do know that the seed has been
smoked. I think that the proposition of the seed people
sterilizing the seed by heat and moisture will certainly do a lot
to kill this traffic. I think that that one thing might cut this
traffic in half, because much of the trouble we encounter is due
to the trafficker going to a feed store and buying the birdseed
and planting cannabis, and all due to the birdseed being
scattered during the winter. Hempseed is thrown out in the garden
or in the vacant lot. The following year you have a growth of
cannabis. That is what happened in Baltimore, and particularly in
Philadelphia. I know of a case there where the State officers got
over 200,000 pounds of growing plants, as the result of
dissemination by birdseeds. A lot of that growth was being used
illicitly. The traffickers knew where to get it. The plant
reseeded itself. </p>

<p>The action that will be taken under this bill by the birdseed
people in sterilizing the seed should have a remarkable effect in
killing the traffic. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: The sterilized seed will not reproduce? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: It will re-seed itself. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I am referring to the birdseed. What are they
going to do to the birdseed? </p>

<p>MR.ANSLINGER: They are going to kill the germinating power. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: When the seed is then thrown out, what will
happen? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Nothing will happen. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Will it be of any use as a birdseed? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Oh, yes. It will still have food properties. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: The birds will sing just the same? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: There is some question about that.
Sterilization is a voluntary act by the birdseed people. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is not in this bill? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: It is not in there. They voluntarily agreed to
do that under this act. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Yes, it is in the bill. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I wan to bring out one fact that you have not
touched upon yet. As I understand it marihuana is not a
habit-producing drug, at least to the same extent that opium is,
for instance. It is somewhat easier to break the habit in the
case of marihuana than it is in the case of opium smoking? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, you have stated that correctly, Senator.
It is a very difficult matter to break the opium habit. However,
this habit can be broken. There is some evidence that it is
habit-forming. The experts have not gone very far on that. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: There is the impression that it is stimulating
to a certain extent? It is used by criminals when they want too
go out and perform some deed that they would not commit in their
ordinary frame of mind? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: That was demonstrated by these seven boys, who
said they did not know what they were doing after they smoked
marihuana. They conceived the series of crimes while in a state
of marihuana intoxication. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: How many cigarettes would you have to smoke
before you got this vicious mental attitude toward your neighbor?
</p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I believe in some cases on cigarette might
develop a homicidal mania, probably to kill his brother. It
depends on the physical characteristics of the individual. Every
individual reacts differently to the drug. It stimulates some and
others it depresses. It is impossible to say just what the action
of the drug will be on a given individual, of the amount.
Probably some people could smoke five before it would take that
effect, but all the experts agree that the continued use leads to
insanity. There are many cases of insanity. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: Is it every type off hemp that contains this
drug, or is it just some particular type? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLIINGER: Yes, sir; there are different forms, but only
one species. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: This thought has impressed me: I read with care
the supplemental statement which you placed in the record before
the Ways and Means Committee, in which you brought out quite
clearly that the use, which will be &quot;illicit&quot; if we may
describe it that way, in the event this bill becomes a law, has
been known to the peoples of Europe and Mexico and the United
States for centuries. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Do you think that the recent great increase in
the use of it that has taken place in the United States is
probably due to the heavy hand of the law, in its effect upon the
use of other drugs, and that persons who desire a stimulant are
turning to this because of the enforcement of the Harrison
Narcotics Act and the State laws? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: We do not know of any cases where the opium
user has transferred to marihuana. there is an entirely new class
of people using marihuana. The opium user is around 35 to 40
years old. These users are 20 years old, and know nothing of
heroin or morphine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: What has happened to the new dissemination of
it? We did not hear anything of it until the last year or so. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I do not think that the way against opium has
very much bearing upon the situation. That same question has been
discussed in other countries; in Egypt particularly, where a
great deal of hasheesh is used, they tried to show that the
marihuana user went to heroin, and when heroin got short he
jumped back to hasheesh, but that is not true. This is an
entirely different class. </p>

<p>I do not know just why the abuse of marihuana has spread like
wildfire in the last 4 or 5 years. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Could you give us any estimate of the number of
persons that are engaged in this illicit traffic? Please state
that as nearly as you can. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I can only give you what our records show,
Senator. There were about 400 arrests throughout the States in
the year. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is for violations of State law? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: For violations of State law. That would not
include the arrests in California, where I understand they have
several hundred a year; but the figure I am giving you of 400
arrests would be about the average number that are being picked
up now, under just a noncoordinated enforcement policy , every
State doing its own work, and bringing us in occasionally. When
they run into &quot;dope&quot; work, and bringing it to us
occasionally. When they run into &quot;dope&quot; we down and
say, &quot;It is marihuana and you take the case.&quot; </p>

<p>The state of Ohio recently seized what we call a
&quot;plant&quot;. It was a seizure of marihuana. These people
had a mailing list of 6,000 customers scattered throughout the
States. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: How were they dispensing it? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: They were selling it in lots from a pound down,
just selling it by mail. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: There was nothing in the law to prevent a man
in Columbus, Ohio, using the mail in selling it to a person in
Louisville, Kentucky? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: No, they are doing it every day. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Is there anything in the present bill to
prevent them using the mail? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Under this bill it would have to be tax-paid,
and all of that would be illicit, sir. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: You say there are several hundred arrests in
California alone, and about that same number throughout the rest
of the United States? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLNGER: There are about the same number in the rest of
the United States. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: How do you account for that? Is it because of
their state law? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: It is because they have a state enforcement
agency there. They vigorously enforce the law. I might say that
Pennsylvania is doing important work also. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: It might be just as prevalent in other
states; but for the fact that we do not have the law enforced as
efficiently? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I would not say it is as prevalent, but
certainly the use has increased in the last few years. In
Pennsylvania the enforcement people are very active today,
particularly in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, and the are
constantly calling upon us. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Are they endorsing the Harrison Narcotics Act
in manner satisfactory to you? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir; that is satisfactory, but they are
asking us for help every now and then when they run into a rather
large situation. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think that while you are on that point you
had better make clear the need for Federal legislation. You say
the States have asked you to do that. I presume it is because of
the freedom of interstate traffic that the States require this
legislation? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: We have had requests from states to step in
because they claimed it was not growing in that state, but that
it was coming in from another state. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: And they could not touch that? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: And they could not touch it and we could not
touch it. </p>

<p>There is need for coordinated effort. We are required to
report ot the League of Nations, under a treaty arrangement, all
of the seizures of marihuana made throughout the United States.
It is rather difficult to get, I would say, half of them. One
particular reason and one primary reason for this is -- usually
these complaints come to us first -- that there is
&quot;dope&quot; being used in a certain place, and that there is
a supply of it on a certain street. Our men go and investigate
it, and they find that it is marihuana. Well, we have to call in
the state officers and there is a lot of lost effort. Very often
by the time the state officer comes the case is gone. I would say
in most of these cases we get the information first and turn it
over to the state officer. Now, we want to coordinate all of that
work throughout the states. By state and Federal cooperation we
can make a good dent in this traffic. </p>

<p>For instance, all states had narcotics laws before the
enactment of the Harrison Narcotics Act, but until the Federal
Government stepped in no substantial progress was made. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: What have you to say about the extent of the
production of hemp? May it be produced in practically any state
in the Union? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir, it can be produced. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: There is climatically no reason why it could
not be produced everywhere in the United States? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: No. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Growing as a weed could take place anywhere? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Anywhere; yes, sir. That has been demonstrated.
</p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: A moment ago I asked you what was the yield per
acre, and you then told me so much of the flower and so much of
the leaves. What is the combined yield per acre of both the
flower and the leaves? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I would not be able to say that, sir. That
would be impossible. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Is there any way of getting that information? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: We are growing an experimental crop over here
on the Agricultural Farm. We can find out that way, or we can
take a plant and strip the leaves and the flowers, and find out
how many plants there are in an acre and multiply it. I think
that would give a reasonably accurate estimate. I think I can
find that out. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: I wish you would. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Now, Commissioner Anslinger, I do not know
whether you are the best man to answer this question, or Mr.
Hester. What dangers, if any, does this bill have for the persons
engaged in the legitimate uses of the hemp plant? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I would say that they are not only amply
protected under this act, but they can go ahead and raise hemp
just as they have always done it. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It has been represented to me that the farmer
might hesitate to grow hemp when he is not only subjected to a $5
tax but also to the supervision by the Government, or what you
might call the &quot;nosing&quot; of the Government into his
business. What have you to say to this proposition? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Well, I would say the answer to that is the
fact that they are already controlled under state legislation. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: In practically every state in the Union. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Not all the states, but certainly in a lot
hemp-growing states they are controlled. In most of the states
cultivation is prohibited but in some states they are regulated
by license. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Administratively, it seems you have charge of
the administration of the tax and the collection of the tax? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Just what would happen? We will take a farmer
living the other side of Alexandria, over in Virginia. Just what
would happen to him if he wanted to grow 2 acres of hemp? What
would he have to do? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: He would go down to the collector of internal
revenue and put down his $5 and get a registration, a stamp tax.
That would permit him to grow under the act, and at the end of
year ---- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is a stamp tax similar to the one a doctor
gets who uses a narcotic? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir, the same kind of tax. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: He would hang that up in his house? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Yes, sir. At the end of the year we would just
ask how much he grew. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Would you not go down and look his field over,
to ascertain whether he was making any illicit use of the
otherwise worthless byproduct? As I understand it, there is no
legislation about the use of the petals or the flowers or of
these leaves. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: So far very few of these hemp people have been
involved. Well, they have not been involved in the illicit
traffic at all.. This case in Texas is the only case I know of.
We were not going to supervise his crop. It would be impossible. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I do not mean that, but suppose that some
fellow come along and says, &quot;I will give you $100 to let me
go in and strip your leaves and top flowers from your hemp
crop.&quot; How would you ever cover that? How would you meet a
situation of that kind? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Certainly under the act, if the farmer agreed
ot that, they would both be guilty of conspiracy to violate the
act. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: But you would exercise no particular
supervision over the growing of that crop? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: The exercise would be in this way: If we see
Mr. Dewey Doss, the photograph of whose place I showed you, go in
and pay $5 to the collector, we would watch that. We would be
very careful to see what disposition he made of that, but we
would certainly know the sheep from the goats without any close
general supervision. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I do not think that you would have any trouble
with legitimate manufacturers, because they are dealing with the
Government; but the farmer himself might be a little disposed not
to grow the hemp, knowing the illicit use that might be made of a
part of his crop. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: It is just an information return. That is all
we would be interested in, unless he would conspire with someone
else to have the crop stripped. But one saving feature about this
whole thing so far as the farmer is concerned is that the crop is
cut before the resin reaches the nth state. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Before it reaches its greatest potency? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: In other words, before it reaches its greatest
potency. There is some resin that comes up through the plant, but
if he is a legitimate hemp producer he will cut it down before
the resin makes its appearance. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You had before the Ways and Means Committee two
samples of the plant. Do you happen to have any of those samples
here? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: We do not have them here this morning. We can get
those samples for you. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: The plant which I have in my hand now can be
easily distinguished as you go along the road. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS. You can see that along all the highways of the
country. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Well, Senator Davis, that will grow up 16 feet.
</p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: How high? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Sixteen feet. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: Sixteen feet? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Sixteen feet. Of course when they are small
like that you cannot distinguish them. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: At what height are they usually harvested? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: About 14 or 16 feet. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: At that height? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Not for hemp production. That is for resin. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I mean for hemp production. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: Oh, for hemp production, I would say around 10,
12, 14 feet. But it is certainly before the resin gets up there
to do the damage. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Are there any other questions that any member
wants to ask Mr. Anslinger? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER (sic): What is the return to the farmer per
acre? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I do not know. The hemp people here could tell
you what the return is, but I understand it is around $30. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Does it require intense cultivation? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: I do not think so. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: It is a weed that will grow, is it not? </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: It will grow without any trouble. In fact, a
lot of these illicit traffickers will try to hide their field
with corn. They will grow corn all around it. Well, the hemp will
shoot right up above the corn and will grow 4 or 5 feet higher. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Before we complete our case I think we ought to
say one word on the regulations, if I may? </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Yes; we shall be glad to have that. </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: From time immemorial it has been the policy of
Congress in imposing taxes and in providing exemptions under
certain conditions from the imposition of certain taxes, to
provide that the exemption will be made under regulations to be
prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. </p>

<p>Take for example in this particular case, in the Revenue Act
of 1932 they provided that automobile parts and accessories
should be exempt from taxes if the manufacturer sells them to a
manufacturer who is going to make a complete automobile or truck.
</p>

<p>In order to get that exemption the manufacturer who is going
to sell that part of an automobile or truck to the other
manufacturer, who is going to make a completed truck, cannot get
that exemption except under regulations to be prescribed by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. </p>

<p>The Commissioner merely requires him to obtain a certificate
from the other manufacturer that this part is to be used in the
manufacture of a completed truck. </p>

<p>In this particular we have exactly the same situation here,
and we are simply following the practice, I say, that Congress
has followed from time immemorial in revenue acts. The farmer
here will not even have to go to the Collector's office. All he
will have to do will be merely to mail in his five dollars, and
they will send him the stamp tax and the registration. At the end
of the year he will make an information return as to how much
land he has under cultivation and what disposition he has made of
it. </p>

<p>When he wants to sell his crop off seeds all he will have to
do under the regulations of the Treasury Department will be to
obtain some evidence from the person to whom he sells it, that
that person is entitled to the exemption. </p>

<p>That is the situation with respect to the seed, which is the
important item involved here so far as the domestic interests are
concerned. Of course, the fiber products are entirely out of the
bill. </p>

<p>That completes our case. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Hester, what are you going to do with
respect to the large number of farmers who are not going to know
about this law in its earlier stages of enforcement? It seems to
me that with the lack of dissemination of information, a great
many of them are going to engage perhaps in a legitimate
production of it, not knowing of this law. Are you rather harsh
toward those fellows, or can you be reasonable and generous
toward them? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: No, the bill will not become effective for 60
days, and there are not a great many of the hemp producers in the
United Sates. Of course the Treasury Department would do
everything it possibly could to notify these people. There would
be no hardship imposed upon them. This would be administered
exactly as any other revenue act is administered, and frequently
there are excise taxes imposed where the individual does not know
anything about it. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: What legitimate uses are now made of the hemp
plant in the United States. That is, what causes the farmer to
raise it? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Some raise it for seeds. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Do you mean birdseeds? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: Yes. They raise the seeds for use in the
manufacture of birdseed. They make oil out of it. Most of the
seed, however, that is used in the manufacture of oil is imported
from Manchuria, but it may develop in this country. </p>

<p>Then after the seed is used for the making of oil, they take
that seed and crush it, and make meal and meal cake, and that is
sold to cattle raisers. </p>

<p>The oil is used in the manufacture of varnish and paint and
soap and linoleum, and then in the case of the mature stalk they
use that for making fiber and fiber products. Of course, they are
entirely outside the bill. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: While primarily you are placing a tax, it is
for the sole purpose of getting and enforcement of the law, and
getting a plan for enforcing it? </p>

<p>MR. HESTER: That is correct. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: If it should be one dollar, what difference
would that make? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Well, the situation is simply this: ------- </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: I am only talking from the farmer's point of
view, of charging him one dollar instead of five dollars. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I am glad you raised that point, Senator Davis,.
When the Harrison Act was first before the Supreme Court the
occupational tax was only one dollar, and the vote was 5 to 4. In
other words the Supreme Court said, &quot;This is a revenue
measure&quot;, although the tax was only one dollar. But the vote
was five to four. After that Congress raised the occupational tax
and then when the case came before the Supreme Court, the vote
was six to three. and the Court said, &quot;We now have more
reason to sustain the constitutionality of this act that we had
before, because it is more of a revenue act than it was
then.&quot; </p>

<p>In the case of the producers, under the Harrison Narcotics
Act, although there are no poppies grown in this country, if they
could develop it so that they could raise poppies, so that they
could get opium from it, the farmer would have to pay $24, but in
this case the producer only pays five dollars. </p>

<p>We have left the practicioner at one dollar, because that was
the situation of the Harrison Narcotics Act, and that is the real
reason why the figures are set in this bill at $24, $5, $3, and
one dollar, so that we can have a real revenue raising measure. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: You charge five dollars an acre under this? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Oh no, a year. </p>

<p>SENATOR DAVIS: I meant to say this: You charge five dollars
whether he produces on one acre of on one thousand acres? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>Senator Brown: Have you worked out the Canal Zone matter with
the Department? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: We have. They wish to be exempted, and they have
agreed not to propose their amendment providing for direct
regulation of marihuana in the zone because as I pointed out to
you the other day it might indicate on the face of the bill that
it is a regulatory measure, but they wish to be exempted, and we
have no objection. We are preparing to change that. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Just one or two more matters. Why should they
be exempted? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: There is no legitimate business in the Canal Zone,
and they say they have sufficient control over the marihuana
problem in the zone at this time under existing legislation, and
they object to general legislation being applied. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It would probably be considerable duplication
of effort down there. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: There might be some. The Harrison Narcotics Act
applies to the Canal Zone, and that is the reason why it was
included in this bill. But the Treasury Department has no
objection if the Canal Zone goes out. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Will this entail any considerable increase in
personnel of the Department? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: No, I do not think so. </p>

<p>MR. ANSLINGER: No, sir. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I understand this measure has the approval of
the Treasury Department. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, oh, yes. it is strongly recommended by the
Treasury Department. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is there anything further from the 'government?
Do you desire to have a chemist testify? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I think we have finished our case. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Very well, Thank you, Mr. Hester and
Commissioner Anslinger. </p>

<p>The next witness on my list is Mr. Rens of the Rens Hemp Coo.
of Brandon, Wis. We would be glad to hear from him. </p>

<h1>STATEMENT OF MATT RENS, </h1>

<p><b>REPRESENTING RENS HEMP CO., BRANDON, WIS.</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>MR. RENS: We have no objection whatever to controlling
narcotics. Personally I am a producer, a farmer, and also a mill
owner, a hemp mill owner, and we grow this hemp solely for the
purpose of fiber. It is American hemp, which we sell to the Navy
and to other industrials in the East, the spinning companies. </p>

<p>We have prepared an interpretation of this bill as we see it,
and also a general summary of the discussion and suggested
changes and reasons for these changes. This is quite lengthy. I
do not know as you want to take the time for me to read it. We
might have it ins the record and give it to you folks. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: We would be glad to have you present the
statement and put it in the record. </p>

<p>(The memorandum presented by Mr. Rens. is as follows:_ </p>

<p>Interpretation of H.R. 6906 -- Marihuana (Hemp) Bill </p>

<p>This attempt to interpret H.R. 6906 is intended to help
legitimate hemp producers and processors to understand these
provisions in H.R. 6906 that directly affect them. </p>

<p>RELATTION TO PRODUCERS </p>

<p>There are in the United States two rather distinct classes of
hemp producers; one produces hemp for seed; and the other
produces hemp for the fiber that is in the stalks The same person
may produce for both purpose, yet the usual situation is for
persons to produce for one or the other purpose only. the bill
H.R. 6906, affects each class of producers alike so far as taxes
and registrations are concerned. </p>

<p>Occupational Registration of Producers </p>

<p>Each producer of hemp, regardless of whether he is producing
for seed or for fiber, is required to register with the internal
revenue collector in the district in which the producer is
locate. While the specific procedure is not stated in the bill,
it is assumed that the producer will obtain the required forms
for occupational registration, and that the will execute these
forms and deliver them to the collector of internal revenue, when
this is done and the required tax in paid , the producer is then
registered. (Sec. 2a-5c) </p>

<p>There is nothing in H.R. 6906 to indicate the exact procedure;
such as whether the forms must be purchased, whether they may be
obtained by mail; or whether they must be obtained in person.
Neither is there any indication of the specific information that
must be supplied; such as acreage grown, or to be grown; intended
disposition of the harvested crop, or the like. </p>

<p>Transfer Registration of Producers: </p>

<p>The producer of hemp seed can transfer the seed which he
produced to any other registered producer without additional
registration or tax, or without an order from the purchaser (sec.
6b-5). The producer of hemp see. can also transfer to any
nonproducer, who is a registered dealer, upon the presentation of
an official (written) order for; or he may sell to an
unregistered dealer on the presentation of a properly executed
official order form (sec. 6a) </p>

<p>The producer can deliver this mature hemp straw (stalks) to
any person without any additional registration or tax and without
any order on an official form from the purchaser of the straw
(stalks) (sec. 1b) </p>

<p>Producers Taxes: Any person who grows hemp plants, regardless
of the purpose for which they The tax is paid to the collector of
internal revenue of the district in which the crop is grown and
the amount as now provided in the bill is five dollars per year
for each producer. (sec. 2a-2) </p>

<p>RELATION TO DEALERS </p>

<p>There are several classes of dealers, including registered
producer-dealers, registered dealers, who are not producers, and
dealers who are neither registered as producers nor registered as
dealers. Also there are dealers in seed, and the dealers in hemp
straw (mature stalks). Dealers in hempseed will be affected by
the proposed legislation while dealers in hemp straw (mature
stalks) are exempted. </p>

<p>Occupational registration of dealers: A dealer in hempseed who
is also a registered producer of hempseed, is not required to
register (reregister) as a dealer (sec. 2a-5). Those not
registered as producers, who wish to deal in hempseed must
register as a dealer (sec. 2a-5) </p>

<p>Transfer Registration of Dealers: All dealers who purchase
hemp seed, except registered producers, are required to use
official order form (register each purchase) (sec. 6b-5) </p>

<p>The foregoing means that, if anyone who is not a registered
producer, wishes to purchase seed, he must execute and official
blank for each purchase which he makes and pay a tax in each
case. this applies, regardless of whether or not the person from
whom the seed is purchased is a registered producer. The official
forms (order blanks) are bought from the collector of internal
revenue and must be prepared (filled out) by the collector (not
by the dealer) (sec. 6d) </p>

<p>The foregoing indicates that dealers, not registered as
producers, who wish to purchase hempseed, must visit the internal
revenue collector, supply him with whatever information is
required, and the collector must enter this information on the
order form. </p>

<p>Dealers' Occupational tax: Any persons dealing in hempseed,
who is not a registered producer must pay and occupation tax of
three dollars per year. <br>
this is paid in connection with is registration (sec. 2-5) </p>

<p>Dealer's Transfer Tax: Any person who deals in hemspeed and
who is not a registered producer pays a transfer tax. This is in
addition to his occupational tax. The amount of the transfer tax
is one dollar per ounce. </p>

<p>The foregoing means that anyone who is not a registered
producers and wishes to purchase (transfer) hempseed is required
to pay a tax of one dollar per ounce. </p>

<p>It is also provided in the bill that any person, who is not
registered either as a producer or as a dealer, can purchase
hempseed from a registered producer or dealer by presenting an
official and properly executed order form, and by paying a tax of
$100 per ounce. </p>

<p>GENERAL SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS </p>

<p>The utilization of hemp fiber is an old, well established, and
legitimate industry in the United States. Every person engaged in
the hemp industry would be affected by the proposed legislation.
The farmer-producer of hemp for fiber -- the person who plants,
grows, and harvests the fiber crop-- would be obliged to register
as a producer and to pay the producer's occupational tax. He
would probably register and pay the tax at the time he obtains
the seed. The seed would be distributed to him by the hemp
milling company. The producer of hemp for fiber would be obliged
to submit to no other registration, nor pay any additional tax,
in order to distribute all of his hemp straw (mature stalks) to
the hemp company; thus the procedure for growing and handling the
crop for fiber is reasonably clear cut and understandable. </p>

<p>Hemp companies in order to obtain the seed and distribute it
to the farmer-growers would be obliged either to qualify as a
producer or as a dealer. To qualify as a producer, the hemp
company would be obliged to grow hemp on its own account and to
register as such and to pay the producer's occupational tax. To
qualify as a dealer, a hemp company would be obliged to register
and pay the dealer's occupational tax, and in addition sell only
against properly executed order forms. </p>

<p>Relative to the requirements concerned with the producing,
distributing. and purchasing hempseed, the proposals in the bill
are decidely complicated and involved. In an attempt to trace the
procedure from the producer of hempseed to the final consumer,
who plants the seed for fiber purpose, we arrive at the
following: The person who grew hempseed would be obliged to
register and pay an occupational tax of five dollars. 'As a
registered producer, he could sell seed to any other registered
producer without any further registration, or payment of taxes
for the crop year concerned. If he were to sell to any person
other than a registered producer then the person to whom he sells
would be obliged to present a properly executed order form (a
form filled out by the collector of internal revenue). This
purchaser would have to register and pay a dealer's occupational
tax of three dollars and in addition pay a tax of one dollar per
ounce for the see purchased. This of course, means that no on,
except those registered as producers, could do business in
hempseed. In other words, this means that the only persons who
could buy and sell hempseed would be those registered as
producers; thus a registered fiber hemp grower in Illinois or
Wisconsin would be obliged to buy his hempseed from a registered
hempseed grower in Kentucky. This would exclude all legitimate
dealers in hempseed other than those who are producers as well as
dealers. It would also exclude hemp milling companies from acting
as dealers unless they want to qualify as producers. </p>

<p>Relative to the proposed tax on producers, there appears to be
no good reason why the amount should be five dollars per year for
each producer. Such a tax would force all small producers out of
the business of growing hemp and the proportion of small
producers in considerable. The tax should not be more than one
dollar per year for each grower, </p>

<p>SUGGESTED CHANGES IN H.R. 6906 </p>

<p>These suggestions are proposed in the interests of those
persons only who are connected with the legitimate hemp industry
in the United States, including hem fiber milling and processing
companies, farmers who produce hempseed, and farmers who produce
hemp for fiber. </p>

<p>1. I ever instance in which the word &quot;marihuana&quot; is
used in H.R. 6906, the term &quot;Cannabis&quot; should be
substituted. </p>

<p>2. Viable hempseed should be excluded from the definition of
Cannabis (marihuana); thus excluding all transfers of hempseed,
but not excluding producer of hemp seed (sec. 1b) </p>

<p>3. the definition of &quot;producer&quot; should be clarified
so that there can be no misunderstanding as to what persons are
producers. (sec. 1c) </p>

<p>4. The occupation tax for producers should be reduced from
five dollars per year to one dollar per year (Sec. 2-2) </p>

<p>REASONS FOR PROPOSED CHANGES </p>

<p>1. As used in the bill (H.R. 6906) the term
&quot;marihuana&quot; is synonomous with true hemp, the
scientific name of which is Cannabis sativa L. The chemical
substance found in hemp which produces the narcotic effects has
been officially termed &quot;Cannabis indica&quot;, and is known
throughout the world as Cannabis indica. Since botanists now
recognize hemp as consisting of one species, the term
&quot;indica&quot; should be discontinued; thus in referring to
hem in a narcotic sense, the term &quot;Cannabis&quot; is most
appropriate and more universally understood. There can be no good
reason for using the term marihuana, which is purely a localized
term of Mexican (Indian) origin, and has no more general
significance and is no more universally recognized that
&quot;bhang&quot;, &quot;hashish&quot;, and similar local terms.
Furthermore, in all national narcotic acts and in all state
narcotic acts the term Cannabis is used. Also in the Senate bill
(S. 326), introduced in the 75th Congress on January 25, 1937 the
term &quot;Cannabis&quot; is used. </p>

<p>2. By excluding hemp seed from the definition of cannabis
(marihuana) no registration or tax will be necessary by those who
transfer, import, or otherwise deal in either viable or
sterilized hemp seed. No evidence has been obtained, either by
scientific investigation or by practical observation to indicate
that hemp seed, as handled in the trade, contains an appreciable
proportion of the chemical substances which cause the narcotic
effect. The substances producing the narcotic effect have never
been specifically isolated or discovered. No one knows what
specific chemical compound or compounds produce the narcotic
effect. Biological tests on experimental animals are therefore
necessary. A recent and thorough-going inquiry indicates that
there are no biological tests or other researches which show that
narcotic-producing substances are present in the seeds themselves
in a sufficient proportion to be harmful, in fact, there is
nothing that shows that true seeds cause any of the narcotic
effects. </p>

<p>The technical evidence given in the hearings on H.R. 6385
shows that the seed does not contain an appreciable proportion of
the narcotic substances. The hearings also show that the seed was
considered so harmless as to warrant omitting sterilized hemp
seed from the definition of marihuana; thus in H.R. 6906
sterilized hemp seed is excluded (compare sec. 1 b, H.R. 6385
with sec. 1 b G.R. 6906.) There is also no evidence, either
practical or technical, to show that hemp seed has ever been used
to produce the drug effect. </p>

<p>All of the foregoing indicates very clearly that hemp seed as
such is not a source of marihuana. The requiring of registration
and tax payment by producers who transfer hemp or dealers who
trade in hemp seed must be construed as for the sole purpose of
obtaining information concerning where and by whom hemp as a
plant is being grown. It seems reasonable to assume that little
or nothing would be accomplished by registering and taxing the
transfer of hemp seed; that seed which would thus be registered
is not the source from which illegitimate producers of handlers
would obtain their supply; that those who use hemp for illicit
use would not report such transactions nor is it likely that any
transactions that such persons would make would be detectable
through the registering and taxing of legitimate dealers in hemp
seed. Illicit producers either carry over the seed from year to
year, or obtain it from others who deal in the same traffic, or
obtain it from plants that grow in a wild state in practically
all sections of the United States. Another thing, hemp plants are
noticeably conspicuous. They are large and readily observable,
and thus wild patches and all other areas can be easily detected
if any attempt is made to do so, and it seems reasonable to
assume that the use of Cannabis as an illicit drug will not be
controlled unless there is a thorough-going surveillance of the
growing plant. </p>

<p>In consideration of the foregoing, it is sincerely contended
that any tax or registration required of those who deal in hemp
seed to be used for legitimate purposes would not reduce to any
extent whatever the use of hemp for producing Cannabis
(marihuana). </p>

<p>3. The term &quot;producer&quot; as defined in H.R. 6906
includes both the persons who cultivate and grow the plants as a
crop, and also those who transfer (sell or deal in) use,
compound, process or consume Cannabis (marihuana). </p>

<p>In the definition there is no distinction between a true
producer and a dealer, yet the tax on a producer is different
than that on a dealer and the whole set-up of the bill rather
definitely distinguishes between the producer and the dealer. </p>

<p>It is urged, therefore, that the term &quot;producer&quot; be
limited to include only those persons who plant, cultivate,
harvest, or in any way facilitate the natural growth of
marihuana. There should be no mention in connection with the term
&quot;producer&quot; of such functions as transferring, or making
use of the plant. If it seems proper to include volunteer hemp
(which grows without planting); then the definition should
specifically include such hemp. (sec. 4b) </p>

<p>4. In H.R. 6906 it is proposed to tax each producer of hemp
(Cannabis or marihuana) five dollars per year. The tax proposed
for dealers is three dollars per year. and the tax proposed for
physicians, dentists, and the like is one dollar per year. Now
there does not seem to be any good reason why a producer should
be taxed any more than a physician, dentist, and the like. It
cannot be contended that a tax of five dollars would be necessary
in order to finance the enforcement of the bill because the
income obtained, if producers were taxed five dollars per year,
would not be greater than $3,500 per year. A reasonably accurate
estimate of the number of producers in the United States in 1937
shows that there are approximately 300 in Illinois, 120 in
Wisconsin, 50 in Minnesota, 200 in Kentucky, and 10 in Texas -- a
total of 680, which if taxed five dollars each, would provide an
annual revenue of $3,400. Now, this clearly indicates that, as a
source of revenue, a tax of five dollars per grower would be of
little consequence. On the other hand, individual growers in many
cases would be severely taxed, for in some sections it is common
practice for farmers to grow very small acreages. </p>

<p>In the Kentucky River bottom, where hemp is grown for seed, an
acreage per grower of less than one acre, and as little as
one-fourth acre, is not unusual. Also in Wisconsin, where hemp is
grown for fiber only, farmers may grow as little as one acre and
they frequently grow as little as four acres. For such small
growers, the tax would amount to from $1.25 per acre to as much
as $20 per acre. Thus, this bill, if enacted, would eliminate all
small growers. Thus it seems reasonable, fair, and in every way
in keeping with the intention of the proposed legislation that
the occupational tax for producers of hemp should not be more
than one dollar per year per individual producer. </p>

<p>CONCLUDING STATEMENT </p>

<p>It is maintained that the foregoing proposed changes would in
nowise defeat te purpose of the bill or weaken its effectiveness.
Sufficient authority is contained in section 10a to allow the
Treasury Department to prescribe legislation covering reports,
records, and the like. In addition, the proposed changes if made
would permit those now engaged in the legitimate phases of the
hemp industry to continue as heretofore without any serious
disturbance. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: With the general purposes of the bill you are
in agreement? </p>

<p>Mr. Rens: Yes </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You suggest a few modifications to it? </p>

<p>MR. RENS. Yes, sir. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Have you discussed that with Mr. Hester or
anyone in the Treasury Department? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: We have written to Mr. Anslinger, and we have sent a
copy of this to Mr. Edwards, of the Division of Cotton and Other
Fibers, of the Bureau of Standards. He has a copy of this also. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Rens, unless you have something else to
present you are excused and we thank you. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: No, not particularly, I think this covers it. As a
farmer, I am interested. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: We will take this into consideration. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: The reason I would state for reducing the fee from
five dollars to one dollar is this, that there are so many
farmers in Kentucky especially that grow this. That is where we
get our seed, in Kentucky. They have perhaps one-eighth or a
quarter of acre. It would discourage those farmers from growing
hemp </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: How much would they get from say an eighth of
an acre in way of total return? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Perhaps 12 or 14 bushels. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: What would that be worth? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: They may get two or three dollars a bushel. I do not
think they get more. We have to pay more. We have to pay the man
over there, the dealer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is all he would get at his farm? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Yes, and another thing, the fiber, our farmers will
hesitate. It will hurt us in getting the acreage for the mill. We
have 600 acres, personally; that is, the mill has; and we have
some 60 growers. Now, the tax I think we will have to pay for the
grower will come to one man. The grower will hesitate. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Hester, do you hear what he says to the
effect that farmers in Kentucky that produce for his mill, some
of them grow as small an amount as one-eighth of an acre and
their total return at the farm would be somewhere from twelve
dollars to fifteen dollars? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Bushels -- bushels per acre. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: How much in dollars? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Sometimes the yield will be less -- maybe from $20
to $30. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: $20 to $30? </p>

<p>MR. RENS: An acre; yes. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Well, of course, taking $5 out of $20 -- is a
high percentage. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: They would just have to add that five dollars tax
onto the price that this gentleman would pay for it. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Then you have first the price of the seed, and then
you have your transfer again. Another thing is the transfer of
this. If the man that buys it from Kentucky is a delaer, and not
a producer, that will mean one dollar an ounce. That man is out
of business. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I do not follow you there. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: As we see this bill, the interpretation of that is
that the dealer, who is not a producer ---- </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Let me say this. I think I can case the committee
time on that. We did not know until you have just made the
statement there, and I think Mr. Johnson brought it to our
attention, that there are some dealers in this country who act as
a broker for seeds. Now, we have no objection to an amendment in
this that would take care of that situation. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Exempting them? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, so there will not be any transfer tax. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Will you take care of that? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes. We will take care of that so they will save
that. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: I see no reason why growers should be charged five
dollars and the dentists or the doctors one dollar. They use the
drug which you are trying to prohibit, which you are tryng to
control. </p>

<p>Now, we harvest our hemp in the state when it is still green,
with no seed in itt and we field-wet it. All these leaves are
gone. There is no marihuana drug there in the way we handle it in
Wisconsin, and still the grower must pay. We often have grower
that only have say, two or three acres of hemp. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Do you think, Mr. Hester, an arrangement
whereby you would cut that five dollars down one dollar for
fractions of an acre would be any serious impediment? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Just how do you mean, Senator Brown? </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Suppose you made it five dollars for an acre or
more, or something like that, and one dollar for fractional parts
of an acre. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: The question would arise then as to whether that
would be a proper classification under the due process clause of
the Constitution. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Will you give that consideration? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: We will be very glad to look into that. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I can see something in your point there. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: Personally I have grown 100 acres or better. Well,
that is five dollars. but I have men that have two acres or three
acres. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It is the fellow as you said who has a quarter
or an eighth of an acre who has a small amount, who will have to
bear a proportionately heavier burden. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: The real purpose of this bill is not to raise money,
is it? </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Well, we are sticking to the proposition that
it is. </p>

<p>MR. RENS: It will cost a million. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: We thank you, Mr. Rens. </p>

<p>The next witness will be M.G. Moksnes. </p>

<h1>Statement of Mr. Moksnes,</h1>

<p><b>Superintendent of the Amhempco Corporation, Danville, Ill.</b>
</p>

<hr>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I happen to be the superintendent of the Amhempco
Corporation, at Danville, Ill. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I want to say that Congressman Meeks wrote me
about your problem. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: This company was organized three years ago by
Bell Bros., of Muncie, Ind, and the Sloan Interests, who are
textile people in New York. They had in mind developing a process
whereby a fiber that is now being used for rope and cordage could
be further processed to go into textiles, and also that the hurd
or the woody part could be processed and made into plastics.
Three years ago we planted 4,200 acres, last year 1,200 acres,
and this year 7,000 acres., and we are in operation. The capacity
of the plant is 15,000 acres. </p>

<p>We have to contract our seed from the growers in Kentucky,
that was covered by Mr. Rens, and their acreage runs anywhere
from a quarter of an acre up, and we have no objection to the
bill. In fact, any attempt to prevent the passage of a bill to
protect the narcotic traffic would be unethical and un-American.
That is not the point, but we do believe that a tax of five
dollars is going to be prohibitive for the small dealers as well
as the man that grows the hemp; not only the seed dealer, but the
man that grows the crop, because he will average -- I do no know
what the average will be, but they raise as little as two acres. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As I understand it, Mr. Hester can take care of
the dealer. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: The dealers, yes. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That will be generally agreed, that he will be
exempted from the tax.. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: From the transfer tax. he will be exempted from
the transfer tax. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is the deal. That is the transfer tax, but
how about the grower of the seed? </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: The man who only grows one-eighth off an acre
with a $20 or $25 crop cannot be harmed much. he does not have
much at stake. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: He would have to add the occupational tax on to
the price that he sells to the dealer in the city. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: Of course, that would make it pretty
difficult for him to compete with the producer who had 10 or 15
acres. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: You see we are dependent on the small growers
down in the Kentucky 'river bottoms to furnish our seed. There
are small growers who probably do not have over 10 or 15 acres of
land, distributed among several crops. If has to pay five dollars
an acre - -- </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Not five dollars an acre, five dollars a year. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I mean five dollars a year, and he has only a
quarter or half an acre, that tax is going to be prohibitive, we
are going to lose the small growers, and it is the combination of
growers that we have to depend on. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: According to our understanding, the Treasury
will endeavor to see if they can cover that problem, and we will
do our best about it. We are not certain what we can do about it,
but we will do the best we can. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is fine. Now, on the other had, the grower
of the stalk -- well, with 15,000 acres, that is $7,500. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: How is that? It is five dollars and nor more
no matter what the acreage is. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: I mean, 7,500 acres. We have to have about 600
growers. That is the way it will average up. That is $3,000. I am
quite sure that we are going to have trouble getting the farmer
to pay a five dollar tax. We will have to stand that ourselves. </p>

<p>Another point, where are we classed as mill men? We are not
classed as producers,. In fact, we have no classification. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: What is your business? How do you operate? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: We contract the seed from the seed grower on
contract. He raises so much. We pay him so much per bushel. We in
turn take that seed and sell itt to the hemp grower, the grower
of the straw, at cost, on a book charge, and it is deducted in
the fall when he delivers his crop. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: It seems to me you would be a seed dealer. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: A seed dealer? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: A seed dealer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You are also a manufacturer? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: We are also a manufacturer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As I view it under section 2 you would pay one
$24 tax only. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: As a seed dealer? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: As a manufacturer. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: As a manufacturer, and as one who sell, deals
in the product. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: The $24 would cover --- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: The $24? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: Yes, the $24 would cover - - </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That is a hasty summary on my part. Is that
right, Mr. Hester? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That is right. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think on page 2, section 2, in subdivisions
(a) and (a-1) you would be covered. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That point has been in question with us, as to
where we would fit in the picture, so far as a millman is
concerned. We did not want to be expected to ---- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: That section reads: </p>

<p>Every person who imports, manufactures, produces, compounds,
sells, deals in .. . </p>

<p>It would seem to me that you would pay one $24 tax. </p>

<p>Well, we will do our best to meet those problems. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: As we interpret this bill, of course, not knowing
where we were classified, we did not know whether we would expect
to pay one dollar an ounce for the seed or $100 an ounce. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: I think we might save the time of the committee if
this gentleman would let us sit down with him and explain the
bill to him. We have not had an opportunity to do that. I think
we would save the time of the committee by doing that. </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: That will be fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: You will do that some time today? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Yes, we will be glad to, immediately after the
committee adjourns. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is there anything else that you want to present
at this time? </p>

<p>MR. MOKSNES: Nothing else. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Johnson. </p>

<h1>STATEMENT OF ROYAL C. JOHNSON, </h1>

<p><b>ATTORNEY, WASHINGTON, D.C., REPRESENTING CHEMPSCO, INC. OF
WINONA, MINN. AND HEMP CHEMICAL CORPORATION OF MANKATO, MINN.</b>
</p>

<hr>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I am
representing Chempsco, Inc. of Winona. Minn, and the Hemp
chemical corporation of Mankato, Min.. </p>

<p>These people and those associated with them in Minnesota had
2,200 acres of hemp last year, and they use only the fiber and
the stalk. I want to say in the beginning that they are heartily
in favor of this bill. They think the use of marihuana ought to
be prohibited and they feel further that these legitimate
industries dealing with hemp and the stalk owe a duty to the
Government and to the Treasury to cooperate in every way. I would
even go so far as to say that f the do not cooperate they could
readily visualize themselves as entirely out of business, because
no industry, legitimate or otherwise, has any right in their
viewpoint and in mine to be so conducted in the United States as
to aid in the dissemination of any narcotics of any kind. </p>

<p>We have no dispute whatever with Mr. Hester and Mr. Anslinger.
or the Government. We have gone over the testimony carefully, and
we find that the testimony of Mr. Hester and others shows rather
definitely that there is not deleterious matter or property in
the stalk of the fiber. As I showed the chairman the other day,
the leaves and the seeds are the part of the plant that contains
marihuana. </p>

<p>The fiber, stalk, or hurd has nothing in it and the fiber in
which we are interested is an important part of the industry. It
is used in the making off fine papers, condenser tissues, carbon
paper, bible paper, and all other types of papers, including
cigarette papers. </p>

<p>As there is no marihuana, and no resin in the stalk, we think
the phraseology should be changed in the bill to some degree, not
to change the merits of the bill, but the phraseology. so that it
can be made clear that there iis no deleterious property in the
stalk or in the fiber. Very great industries can be worked up in
this country. I can readily visualize without much difficulty
25,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 acres of hemp with 2000,000 acres of
flax being used in the paper industry and in the plastic
industry, concerning which the gentleman just testified. </p>

<p>I would like to suggest a change in subsection (b) at the top
of page 2 in the bill. I do not think the use of the word
&quot;marihuana&quot; belongs in this measure, because it is a
word that came up from Mexico and attached to those cigarettes. I
see no use in it. This is hemp that is being grown, not
marihuana. I am going to offer these suggestion. I have handed a
copy to Mr. Anslinger, and I wish to offer these suggestion. I
have handed a copy to Mr. Anslinger, and I wish to read it for
the committee. Amend section 1, subsection (b) to read as
follows: </p>

<p>The term &quot;marihuana&quot; means such parts of the plant
Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not, which consists of the
leaves of the plant, the seeds thereof, the resin extracted from
any part of the plant, and every compound, manufacture, salt,
derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds, or
resin; but shall not include ---- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Mr. Johnson, as I understand it the petals of
the flower are the most dangerous. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: Yes; which eventually become the seeds. The
flower becomes seed. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It is used, as I understand it, as a petal. It
is not ground up? </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: The leaves. </p>

<p>SENATOR HERRING: Is not the bloom used the same as the
leaves.? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Oh, yes, the flower on the tops. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: The flower and the seeds. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: It seems to me that you did not cover the
flowers. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: I tried to copy in detail the words now in the
bill. I am copying the bill at this time, except as to the
insertion of the word &quot;such&quot; where they say
&quot;all&quot; in the first line. they have not said
&quot;flowers&quot; so I did not say &quot;flowers&quot;. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: &quot;All parts of the plant&quot; would
include the flowers? </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: Then flowers could be inserted. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think so. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: The leaves or the flowers of the plant&quot;; I
concede that, because I have wanted to cover it all (reading): </p>

<p>Such . . . plant, its seeds or resin; and shall not include
oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any compound,
manufacture,, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of mature
stalk, oil or cake of the sterilized seed which is incapable of
germination. </p>

<p>And then for the purpose of clarification I wanted to insert
this: </p>

<p>Specifically excluded are mature stalks known as hemp stalks,
which contain no resin or harmful properties, which are used for
various legitimate commercial purposes, and which are grown by
producers under contract with licensed processors or
manufacturers. </p>

<p>Now, getting down in the practical part of the measure; no one
has any business growing this hemp in any quantity whatever
except under contract with someone who is using it for a
legitimate business. They have no more business growing it on
one-tenth of an acre than I have growing sweet potatoes on my
front lawn. Anyone who uses the seed or who uses the stalk -- the
hurd -- or uses the fiber is a manufacturer, a processor, who
will contract to pay a man a good price to grow it for him; and
these other people ought to be simply barred, and I am in favor
of licensing them. I think the small producer is going to be
eliminated, this man that sticks in 0one-tentth of an acre. An
why shouldn't he be? He is doing no good to himself or anybody
else. But here is a great industry where men will put in 10, 20,
30,40, one gentleman will put in 10 acres, and the people I
represent have planted 2,200 acres and expect to plant 20,000
acres. </p>

<p>This has been experimented with in South Carolina, in Oregon,
and all over the country, because these big industries that use
the fiber and use the hurd have to take into consideration crop
failures, and therefore cannot confine themselves to just
Minnesota or to South Carolina or to Oregon. Some of these people
have already expended $300,000 in the last few years, trying to
work out in big industries the use of this fiber, and they feel
that it should be so stated in the law that the farmer who is
growing the stalk and growing the fiber knows definitely that he
is not growing anything that has marihuana in it. He does not
want to grow marihuana and yet we might lose an industry purely
by the phraseology of the measure. </p>

<p>I think I have said all I could say on that. I could say much
more, but I have stated it in a few words. </p>

<p>Now, on this question of the tax, and the constitutionality of
the law, I am firmly convinced that the farmers can be reduced to
one dollar and this law be sustained. This is not the sort of
measure that people here are saying it is, a regulatory measure
under the guise of a tax measure. We do not need to run around
the corner to the hemp in order to stop the sale of the flower or
of the leaves. it can be taxed like the automobile industry, like
the cosmetic industry, like the fur industry, and we o not need
to use any legal sophistry in this to sustain this statute
because hemp is produced in the United States and I would say in
the presence of this committee that I am sure and would almost
guarantee that Mr. Hester and Mr. Tipton could go before the
Supreme Court and get a unanimous decision, if they would argue
along the lines I am suggesting. This is not like narcotics where
there are no poppies grown, nothing like it. An my judgment a one
dollar tax on the farmers is sufficient. To my mind this industry
is going to be more affected by the regulations, but I have no
doubt Mr. Anslinger and the gentlemen associated with him, with
their wide experience and with their desire to do justice, will
work out regulations far more important than the law which will
be fair to industry and the farmer. </p>

<p>Now, I want to say further a little more on this industry
itself. If there are abuses by the legitimate producer --- </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Just let me ask one question there. You say you
want the farmer to be made to realize that he is not growing
marihuana? </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: In the stalk and fiber. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: In the stalk and fiber, but of course he cannot
grow the stalk and fiber without growing the resin plant? </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: That is right. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: How are you going to leave that out? I do not
see. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: Because he is going to have to sell his product.
He will have to sell this to a manufacturer. Now, as a matter of
fact the people making paper, and the finest grades of paper,
which you cannot make in this country without the use of hemp at
the present time, and which is being imported -- even a great
deal of the paper that goes into our money is being imported --
must have hemp fiber. It is just a ridiculous situation because
it can be made out of our local products in this country. The
paper manufacturer, when he gets the plants simply blows these
leaves away. They disappear when dried. They are gone. As a
matter of fact these people in Minnesota did not know until two
months ago that the hemp which they grew there contained
marihuana. Until this agitation came up they did not dream of it,
and the were as much surprise and anyone else. </p>

<p>Now, they will have some little difficulties, just as the
liquor people had some difficulties, eventually and the man who
does not recognize that, the producer or manufacturer, is going
to be put out of business in my judgment, because there is a
problem with marihuana. I will concede these licenses are right,
but I do think that the farmer's license fee ought to be reduced
to one dollar. I have no fear whatever but what the law will be
declared constitutional. I would like to see such amendments in
there. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Of course, you must have a situation where the
farmer is made to realize, it seems to me, just the opposite of
what you say. He has got to be made to realize that in growing
this legitimate product and fiber it can be put to illegitimate
uses. Therefore I think the bill should place in the farmer a
knowledge of that fact. Otherwise he will be just as your clients
were, ignorant of the fact that he is growing on his farm a
decidedly dangerous and deleterious product. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: Mr. Chairman, do you not think that thought that
that section 2 could be rewritten so it would say definitely that
&quot;in the flower, in the leaves&quot; and so forth, there is a
harmful product? </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Yes, that is all right. </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: So that it is clear, make it clear to him then,
but also make it clear in the bill that there is no harmful
product, which is agreed to by everyone, in the hurd, fiber, and
in the stalk. In other words, I do not think we have any
difficulty. If we would sit around the table for five minutes, I
think this could be worked out so we could do exactly what the
committee wants to do, and that there would be no opposition
whatever to this bill, except a desire on the part of everyone to
strengthen it and make it stronger in every possible way against
the illegitimate use of this hemp. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: If I may say a word there, we will be very happy
to sit down with you Mr. Johnson. I am sure that if you should
ask our recommendation on his amendment that we would agree to
recommend it, but we would be very happy to sit down and study it
with him. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Is that all, Mr. Johnson? </p>

<p>MR. JOHNSON: That is all, and I thank the committee very much.
</p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: We have Mr. Olman, I think as the only
remaining witness. </p>

<h1>STATEMENT OF O.C. OLMAN, </h1>

<p><b>REPRESENTING JUNEAU FIBRE CO. JUNEAU, WIS.</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>MR. OLMAN. From what I have heard here, and from has been
remarked by Mr. Hester, I do not know as I shall take any time of
the committee at all, because I am in the same both that Mr.
Moksnes is, and Mr. Johnson is. </p>

<p>I would like to mention just one or two things, Mr. Chairman,
and that will be all, but I think we can iron it out with Mr.
Hester, for instance, the discussion as to what is a mature
plant. Now, we cut the plant before that, in the pollen stage.
They are not mature according to our understanding. </p>

<p>This is one point I would like to ask Mr. Hester. Another
point, of course is the definition of &quot;producer&quot;, so we
can qualify as a producer. We are &quot;dealers&quot; under the
fill, but we would like to qualify as &quot;producers&quot;. </p>

<p>Then another thing is that for instance a farmer wants to grow
2 acres or 4 acres of hemp, and he has to go before the collector
of internal revenue and give such information as is wanted, and
then get his permit. Now, I think that can be ironed out. If he
has to do that, 60 or 70 off our farmers will have to drive 70
miles to Milwaukee. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: I think you can work that out. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: No, they just write a letter to the collector,
that is all. </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: And, of course we were afraid of the transfer tax,
and so on. </p>

<p>I was interested in the question you asked the doctor, Mr.
Chairman, and that was with reference to supervision or
inspection. I believe that we are in a position to give the
Government a great deal of help in supervising and inspecting and
reporting the growth of hemp. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: For your producers? </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: In our vicinity. I thank you. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: How long a time will you gentlemen want to
submit to the committee such representations as may be agreed
upon? Would Wednesday morning be about right? </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: That would be fine. </p>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Suppose, Senator Herring, we agree on 10
o'clock Wednesday morning for an executive session on this
measures, unless there is a serious disagreement. If there is you
gentlemen, who are in disagreement, can come in. </p>

<p>MR. OLMAN: I am sure there will not be. </p>

<p>MR, HESTER: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. </p>

<h1>Letter from the American Medical Association</h1>

<p><b>Re: H.R. 6906</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Before we adjourn, I desire to place in the
record a letter regarding the pending bill addressed to Senator
Harrison by Dr. William C. Woodward, of the American Medical
Association, Chicago, Ill. </p>

<p>American Medical Association </p>

<p>Bureau of Legal Medicine and Legislation </p>

<p>Chicago, July 10, 1937 </p>

<p>Hon. Pat Harrison </p>

<p>Chairman, Committee on Finance, United States Senate </p>

<p>Washington D.C. </p>

<p>SIR: I have been instructed by the board of trustees of the
American Medical Association to protest on behalf of the
association against the enactment in it present form of so much
of H.R. 6906 as relates to the medicinal use of cannabis and its
preparations and derivatives. The act is entitled &quot;An Act to
impose an occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in
marihuana, to impose a transfer tax upon certain dealings in
marihuana, and to safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and
recording.&quot; </p>

<p>Cannabis and its preparations and derivatives are covered in
the bill by the term &quot;marihuana&quot; as that term is
defined in section 1, paragraph (b). There is no evidence,
however, that the medicinal use of these drugs has caused or is
causing cannabis addiction. As remedial agents, they are used to
an inconsiderable extent, and the obvious purpose and effect of
this bill is to impose so many restrictions on their use as to
prevent such use altogether. Since the medicinal use of cannabis
has not caused and is not causing addiction, the prevention of
the use of the drug for medicinal purposes can accomplish no good
end whatsoever. How far it may serve to deprive the public of the
benefits of a drug that on further research may prove to be of
substantial value, it is impossible to foresee. </p>

<p>The American Medical Association has no objection to any
reasonable regulation of the medicinal use of cannabis and its
preparations and derivatives. It does pretest, however, against
being called upon to pay a special tax, to use special order
forms in order to procure the drug, to keep special records
concerning its professional use and to make special returns to
the Treasury Department officials, as a condition precedent to
the use of cannabis in the practice of medicine. in the several
States, all separate and apart from the taxes, order forms,
records, and reports required under the Harrison Narcotics Act
with reference to opium and coca leaves and their preparations
and derivatives. </p>

<p>If the medicinal use of cannabis calls for Federal legal
regulation further than the legal regulation that now exists, the
drug can without difficulty be covered under the provisions of
the Harrison Narcotics Act by a suitable amendment. By such a
procedure the professional use of cannabis may readily be
controlled as effectively as are the professional uses of opium
and coca leaves, with less interference with professional
practice and less cost and labor on the part of the Treasury
Department. </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the inclusion of cannabis into the
Harrison Narcotics Act would jeopardize the constitutionality of
that act, but that suggestion has been supported by no specific
statements of its legal basis or citations of legal authorities. </p>

<p>Wm. C. Woodward, </p>

<p>Legislative Counsel </p>

<p>Whereupon at 11:37 AM Monday, July 12, 1937, the subcommittee
adjourned. </p>

Commissioner Anslinger:
I assume the press will be after us. The Treasury Department has not 
as yet publicly announced this meeting. The Department will do this 
subsequently. I hope therefore, that none of you will be drawn into 
discussions with reporters until the meeting is concluded. The Treasury 
Department will issue a statement on the meeting.
I want all of you to freely express your opinions on every phase of 
the subject under discussion; and if you differ on any point, we hope you 
will not hesitate to present your side of the picture.
I want to give you a brief review of what took place at Geneva, 
Switzerland, last spring at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on Cannabis, of 
the Advisory Committee on traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs of 
the League of Nations. I think this a fitting way to open the Conference. It 
will illustrate the international significance of the Cannabis problem and 
show the current status of some of the excellent work that is being done 
by other nations on the question.
This work I think was very important, and I want to give you the 
reports of the experts of the various countries which will give you an idea 
as to the points on which the authorities still remain in doubt.

The Secretariat of the League referred to various points submitted 
to the Experts in a questionnaire drawn up for their use in January, l936, 
and used as a basis for the Sub-Committees work. He described the 
research work being undertaken.
The Sub-Committee endeavored to indicate on what phases of the 
Marihuana problem agreement exists, and on what points there is a 
divergence of views which has formed the subject of exchange of 
information between the Experts whether on chemical and agricultural 
questions, or on the medical and pathological questions.
Since the Advisory Committee's last session, Mr. J. V. Collins, 
Government Analyst, Ceylon, on January 12, l938, notified the Committee 
of his acceptance of the Advisory Committee's invitation to act as an 
Expert on Cannabis in place of the late Dr. Symons.
The Committee received important documents from two of its 
Experts, Dr. Bouquet and Dr. de Myttenaere.
Dr. Bouquet has for many years done a vast amount of work on 
Cannabis. He is the Inspector of Pharmacies in Tunis.

Dr. Bouquet submitted reports on the following points:

I	Vegetable products wrongly designated as hemp.
II	Microscopic examination of samples of Cannabis.
III	Physiologically active resin in the staminate Cannabis 
plant.
6

IV	 New variety of Cannabis.
V	Influence of drought on the growth of Cannabis.
VI	Medical uses of Cannabis and drugs with a Cannabis base.
VII	Use of animal charcoal. 
VIII	Dr. James C. Munch's Reaction.
IX	Is light petroleum the only solvent of the active element 
of Cannabis and its preparations? 
X	Addiction by certain solanaceae.

Then the report is supplemented by Dr. Bouquet regarding the following 
points:

I	Are the light petroleum extracts of Cannabis the only 
ones that are physiologically active?
II	Observations on document O.C.1542 (z) (Report on the 
research conducted by the Treasury Department of the United 
States of America, in cooperation with the Department of 
Agriculture, in connection with studies on the chemical 
identification of Cannabis Indica (Cannabis Sativa).
III	Identification test for Cannabis resin, proposed by Dr. de 
Myttenaere.
IV	Method of identifying resin, proposed by Dr. H. J. Wollner.
V	Procedure for experiments.
VI	Observations on the causes of Cannabis addiction in 
North Africa.
Dr. de Myttenaere submitted to the Secretariat a supplement to the 
third note on Indian hemp, and a fourth note on Indian hemp, including a 
study of the published work which has appeared since May, 1937, giving 
observations of Mr. Wollner's experiments in the United States.
Apart from these contributions from Experts of the Sub-Committee 
on Cannabis, the Secretariat received a Study of the Chemical 
Identification of Marihuana (Cannabis Indica)" by Dr. Rafael Plasencia, 
Government Chemist of Cuba, and a reply concerning the same subject 
from the United Kingdon Representative. It also received information 
regarding experiments on the chemical identification of Cannabis indica 
communicated by the United States Government. This is the report 
covering the investigation conducted by the Treasury Department in 
cooperation with the Department's Agriculture.
The United Kingdom also submitted to the Secretariat a 
communication concerning the question as to whether Cannabis stalks 
used commercially for the production of fibre still contained resin. That 
point was also discussed.
As to the American documents, we usually summarize all work that 
has been done on Cannabis, incorporate it into one document and submit it 
to the League of Nations.
As to Dr. Plasencia's experiment; he has followed up Beam's 
experiments and elaborated a new method which he

8

states is absolutely and specifically suitable for Cannabis and constant 
for all the varieties tested, even Merck's extract of Cannabis indica with 
which Beam's reaction gave no result.
Our Government has submitted observations on this paper.
The United Kingdom Representative also transmitted an opinion by 
the Government Chemist who suggests certain modifications in this 
method. These modifications consist of an attempt to separate the 
substances responsible for the characteristic color in Beam's test on the 
assumption that it is a phenol.
All of these documents are available in the United States Treasury 
Department for anyone who would like to study them.
It would seem that Dr. de Myttenaere and Mr. Wollner have different 
opinions on the point as to whether light petroleum is the best solvent for 
Cannabis. Dr. de Myttenaere considers that so far as is known at present, 
light petroleum is the best solvent for the extraction of the active 
principles of Cannabis, and hence the only one suitable for Beam's test; 
and he has carried out experiments as to whether ethyl acetate should be 
substituted, or is preferable as a solvent for petroleum ether.

9

In the report there is also given the list of vegetable products 
wrongfully designated as hemp,
We have a little trouble with that in this country, as it is frequently 
designated as Cannabis, New Zealand hemp, hemp of the Americas, Bombay 
hemp, African hemp, etc.
It has been found that these were all wrong designators used by 
various persons interested in the problem.
NOTE.--Until very recently. the definition of Cannabis sativa 
(marihuana) was based upon the traditional conception that the active 
principle of the drug, technically known as cannabinol or cannabinone, is 
present only in the female or pistillate plant and present there only in the 
flowering tops. Since the development of more refined chemical tests, it 
has been discovered that the active principle is contained in the leaves of 
the pistillate plant as well as the leaves of the staminate plant. This 
brought about the advisability of makihg the definition all inclusive in 
laws for control of the drug found in the male as well as the female plant. 
It will therefore be necessary to change the definition in the League of 
Nations Treaty of 1925.
Dr. Bouquet, while investigating this question, found that it always 
has been acknowledged that intoxicating resin could be obtained from 
male Cannabis plants but in

10

such small quantities that for practical purposes this source of 
production is not utilized at present. He realized, however, that it might 
become worthwhile for traffickers to turn their attention to it, and 
recommended that the free handling of the vegetative parts of both male 
and female Cannabis plants should be prohibited.
That work was started in America by the laboratory of Parke-Davis 
some years ago.
Then the question of the production of the fibre, the condition of 
development, depending on the meterological factors of the crop area was 
discussed. In this respect differences have been noted between the height 
of the plant, and the length, consistency and toughness of the textile 
fibres.
The growing conditions of the plant also affect the output of its 
resin, which depends directly on the degree of temperature; on the dryness 
of the soil; and probably on the amount of sunshine encountered.
In the annual report for Turkey for 1937, there is brought to the 
attention of the Committee data concerning a variety of Cannabis sativa 
having long stalks. It is grown for industrial purposes in various parts of 
Anatolia; the fibre is used for manufacturing ropes and sacks; and its 
resin content is so slight it could not be used for

11

the extraction of a narcotic drug.
That seems to be the answer to our prayers, if true. As to the 
psychical and psychopathic effects of Cannabis, the literature on this 
phase of the subject tends to confirm the analysis as to the psychic 
effects of hashish made as long ago as 1845 by Dr. Moreau de Tours in his 
book, which incidentally is still the standard work on the subject.
Also, Dr. Brottaux in his book on Hashish published in 1934, which I 
think is considered a veritable "bible" on the subject today, has followed 
up and in the main confirmed Dr. Moreau's analysis.
Then there was discussed the relation between Cannabis and 
insanity. There was reference to the work of Dhunsiboy, the Director of 
one of the Hospitals for Insane in Indiain which he points out that the 
prolonged use of Indian hemp leads to insanity.
The work of Dr. Bouquet was discussed; and also the work of the 
British Indian hemp Commission which carried out an inquiry in 1893 and 
1894 into the relationship of Indian hemp and lunacy.
Colonel Chopra did some work in India which was discussed. He found that 
in India a special form of mental disease classed as toxic insanity had 
direct relation to the excessive use of hemp drugs.

12

All of these experts laid stress on "excessive use."
Then there was a proposal discussed to authorize the sale of ganja 
to the Indian population in Burma.
As you probably know, in India. the Government maintains a 
Monopoly, and various narcotic products are sold across the counter tax-
paid.
The League of Nations wanted to point out to the Committee the 
various points that were raised in connection with the proposal to sell 
hemp.
To meet the allegation concerning the increase in insanity due to the 
use of ganja, a table prepared by the Inspector General of Civil Hospitals 
in Burma has been added showing that as far as the mental hospital at 
Tagadale was concerned, the percentage of mental cases attributable to 
the use of ganja and its derivatives varied during the years between 1928 
and 1937 from 0.87 to 4.35; and that in 1936, out of a total of 296 
admissions there were ten such cases, the corresponding figures for 1937 
being 356 and ten respectively.
The Sub-Committee was urged to examine the still-controversial 
question of the relationship between addiction to hemp drugs and the 
spread of insanity.
The work of Dr. Stringaris on Hashish was discussed. He is an 
authority on insanity due to the use of Hashish

13

in Russia. He maintains that a further increase can be expected in the 
ravages caused by Hashish in Asiatic Russia.
Then the question of the relationship between the abuse of narcotic 
drugs and alcoholism arose. It is still a mixed question, and considerable 
recommendations were furnished.
In Algeria, Dr. Bouquet has noted that Heroin addicts were recruited 
from the Hashish addicts, and Dr. Stringaris in Asiatic Russia has found 
that to be the case there also.
In conclusion the Secretariat pointed out that, as a result of 
concurrent investigations, progress has been made on chemical studies 
and research, while fresh information has been gathered in other spheres; 
at the same time, certain points still require clarification, especially in 
connection with the physiological, psychological, and psychopathic effects 
of Cannabis and with the relationships between Hashish-addiction and 
insanity, and between Cannabis-addiction and crime.
After considering all of the recommendations furnished by the 
League of Nations, the Sub-Committee then made the following report, 
which is very pertinent in the light of the points we want to discuss here.

"In discussion of the matter before it, the Sub-Committee divided 
consideration of the subject as follows:

14

(l)	Commercial uses of Cannabis 
(2)	Medical uses of Cannabis 
(3)	Effects of the abuse of Cannabis 
(4)	Methods of detecting the presence of Cannabis
(5)	Legal definition of the term "Cannabis.

The discussions developed the fact that the Committee still lacks 
complete information concerning the commercial uses of Cannabis. The 
Sub-Committee would welcome further information concerning the 
physiological, psychological and psychopathic effects of abusive use of 
Cannabis and the relation between Cannabis-addiction and crime.
Dr. Bouquet pointed out that percentages of resin content in the 
hemp plant raised in different countries should be ascertained with a view 
to deciding whether it is necessary to prohibit or merely to control the 
cultivation of Cannabis for industrial purposes.
The value of the Beam test for detecting the presence of Cannabis 
appears to have been confirmed by a further series of experiments, the 
results of which are before the Committee, including those attained by the 
employment of several different modifications of that text.
Dr. de Myttenaere said that his experience enabled him to state that 
the Beam alkaline reaction and its modifications indicated the chief 
element in the various

15

components of Cannabis resin which was the cause of Hashish addiction, 
i.e.the alcoholic group.
Dr. Bouquet informed the Sub-Committee that a test based upon new 
principles had recently been devised which will form the subject of a 
thesis to be presented by Messrs. Duquenois and Hassan Negm Mustapha at 
the University of Strasbourg in July, 1938, a brief description of which 
will be circulated to the Opium Advisory Committee.
The question of modifying the incomplete definition of Indian hemp 
in the Geneva Convention of 1925 was discussed, but no definite 
conclusion was arrived at. It appeared upon examination that such 
modification would affect not only Article 1 of the Convention, but also 
Articles 4 and 11 and would necessarily involve complicated adjustments 
in the Convention itself. It was therefore decided to postpone further 
consideration of this matter until the next session of this Sub-Committee 
when it is hoped that more time will be available for the work.
Up to the present time, the work of the Sub-Committee has 
consisted almost entirely of collecting information in regard to the 
various phases of the Cannabis problem, and, until the Sub-Committee has 
before it more data than it has at present, it would scarcely be considered 
advisable to undertake definite recommendations."

16

We would like to take inventory of our research and see what is 
needed.
The Federal Government did not get into this picture until after all 
48 states had adopted legislation controlling Marihuana in greater or less 
degree. The Marihuana Tax Act went into effect a little over a year ago, 
and since that time we have destroyed some 16,000 acres of the plant 
throughout the various States; most of it in the Middle West. About l,000 
violators have been arrested by the Federal Government.
I am not trying to sell this book, but I want to call your attention to 
the work on "Marihuana'a written by Dr. Robert P. Walton, Professor of 
Chemistry, University of Mississippi, with a foreword by Dr. Geller who is 
a distinguished pharmacologist connected with the University of Chicago.
I would like to start with the agricultural phases of this problem, 
which will also include the industrial and economic phases.
I am therefore going to call on Dr. Wright of the University of 
Wisconsin and ask him to discuss some of the questions that seem to be 
troubling us.

STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. WRIGHT
Professor of Agronomy University of Wisconsin

17

DR. WRIGHT: Gentlemen, let me say to you in the first place that 
while I am connected with the University of Wisconsin, so far as the hemp 
work is concerned, the hemp being Marihuana, I am working as an agent and 
in cooperation with the Bureau of Plant Industry here in Washington.
I had better assume that you are about the agricultural side like I am 
about chemistry, that you do not know very much about it. Therefore, 
suppose I sketch briefly the practical every day procedure by which hemp 
is handled in the United States and Canada, not mentioning anything about 
the European situation, and as Dr. Robinson is going to review something 
about the history of hemp, I will leave that out entirely.
In the United States hemp is an annual crop produced from seed 
planted each year, planted in the Spring the same as small grains are 
planted, the same as corn is planted.
It has been grown during recent years almost exclusively in very few 
sections; Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
It is planted en masse thickly as small grain, in other words, it is 
drilled in.
It is planted on very good soil in order to be a profitable production. 
It is a crop limited to good soil

18

for profitable production most every where in the world, and it is seeded 
about a bushel to the acre on soil, prepared as for small grain.
After it is planted, there is nothing left to be done except to wait 
for it to be harvested, and it is harvested in the latter part of August, 
throughout September, and sometimes extending into October depending on 
the section of the United States or Canada.
The seed is usually produced in Kentucky, and in the North American 
Continent, very rarely any other place. In the sections where it is grown 
for fibre or industrial uses, seed is not produced.
The usual, or arbitrary way of determining when to harvest a crop is 
when it is well in blossom, we will say rather late blossom when the 
pollen is being fairly cleared, depending from that time on how 
circumstances work out, but that is when it is begun.
It is generally harvested now by special machinery which has been 
developed during the last few years. It is cut and spread in swaths of even 
length. It is left in the stuble, spread out for retting.
Now, the exact procedure varies in different sections of the country. 
This retting period, that is the period when the so-called fibre portion of 
the stem is released

19

from the woody portion, varies from two weeks to, in certain cases, two 
months.
After it has reached that stage where the fibre can be removed from 
the straw by being dressed, it is gathered and bound in bundles and 
shocked. Then it is put in stacks, usually in hemp mills or processing 
plants.
From these stacks it is sent to the dryer, and dried to what is 
commonly called in the trade bone-dry condition and which would mean 8 
or 9 or 10% moisture.
Then it is crushed by the breaking process, that is the fiber is 
separated by the usual process called scutching, and it is divided into two 
kinds of fibre, one the long stretch, and the other tangled, and then it is 
inserted in bales.
That, I believe, is the agricultural procedure of the handling of the 
hemp.
There is a little variation in Kentucky because of the weather 
conditions. It is not retted immediately, but shocked until later in the 
season when the retting conditioning can be done.
In the northern part of the country, it is spread on the ground and the 
retting is done immediately.
Now, I want to avoid going into the acreage and that phase of the 
work for Dr. Robinson is going to cover that.

20

I would like to inject this thought here for I am sure it will do no 
harm, and that is that hemp has been an American industry ever since 
Colonial times It is not a large industry. It has had its ups and downs, but 
it has been an American industry since Colonial times, and it is one of the 
oldest crops that we have in the United States.
It is used, as you know, from an industrial stand-point for textile 
purposes, and to a minor extent for other purposes and Dr. Robinson will 
develop that.
Now, there might be perhaps some questions right now. One or two 
other items I want to take up before I am through.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Go right ahead.

DR. WRIGHT: You know I might not have another chance to say 
anything

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You will be given a chance. Go right 
ahead, Dr. Wright.

DR. WRIGHT: I was just wanted to throw this into the pot, and that 
is, of course, that we who work with the commercial producers, and the 
industry naturally collectively, and I suppose we are justifiable in that, 
our prejudices are on that side. I do not think we would be human if we 
were not, and I do not claim to be other than human. We have a small 
industry in the United States that

21

has had its ups and downs over a long period of time. We still produce 
commercial hemp and fibre. Those in the industry are naturally concerned. 
They have a stake in that they have what little they have invested in the 
business. 
They are not concerned about this last law because I believe they 
were given a very square deal in the national legislation on the matter. 
What they are concerned about is the public position, that indefinite 
intangible thing, public feeling about growing hemp at all. 
They have already been subjected to some rather embarrassing 
situations. 
Now, just suppose that as a result of the agitation, warranted or 
not, and there are probably two views on that, and I am open to both 
views, the extensive publicity that has been given in the hemp states, 
particularly Wisconsin where there is much agitation, that some kind of a 
legislation will come up to put out or eradicate the production of hemp 
under the Weed Control Department or the Legislature appropriating money 
to do it. 
I will not bother you long on that, but I just want to mention that 
and show what problem we will be called on to face. Those men have 
managed to keep their mouths

22
shut and have expressed no views concerning Marihuana in public, for we 
feel we are not in a position to do so, and we would like to be sure of our 
ground before doing it.
Of course, having worked with eradication procedures and 
eradication programs, unless you would convince us otherwise we would 
oppose the eradication program in Wisconsin as we see it now with the 
immense cost and the things of that sort.
Now comes the other phase of it. We have been trying, in cooperation 
with the Bureau of Plant Industry, and Dr. Robinson and the Division of 
Pharmacy of the University of Wisconsin and Dr. Link who is head of the 
Bio-Chemistry Department of the University of Wisconsin to begin a study 
of Cannabis in relation to hemp as a crop. 
Without going into details, I think I have told you my story for the 
present.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We thank you very much, Doctor. Before 
we go on to Dr. Robinson, I think there were various points brought up that 
our conferees would like to discuss.
There is one point about commercial hemp. We did not make a survey 
in your State, but we did make a survey in the State of Minnesota, and 
some of the hemp that was harvested in 1934 is still on the ground.

23

DR. WRIGHT: That is right.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is giving us a great deal of difficulty. 
The farmers up in Minnesota in some of the sections have been subjected 
to various promotion schemes. Due to the existence of stacks of the old 
1934 and 1935 crop of harvested hemp in Southern Minnesota, which is a 
menace to society in that it has been used by traffickers, we have 
arrested a gang who took a truck load of this Marihuana into New York.
I will say that the farmers up there have been cooperating with us 
100%. If they see anybody around that section who looks like a trafficker, 
they bring out their old shot guns, and he is soon disposed of. We have very 
little trouble from the farmers up there.
It is said that every stack contains a plentiful supply for smoking 
purposes.
Allegations have been made that if it was on the ground three years 
there would not be any resin left. Mr. Wollner can tell you how much resin 
some of the experts reported after Marihuana had been lying on the ground 
three years. It seems that the traffickers can find it. Our own chemists 
have found it.
We feel that the farmer is entitled to a reasonable return for these 
old crops. He planted the crop in goodfaith; he has no desire to violate the 
law, and we have

24

been assured that the removal of the harvested crops is very desirable. It 
is a very difficult situation.
Have you any observations to make, or any discussion on the 
question?

DR. ROBINSON: As to thw commercial procedure, tha plant is spread 
out on the land, and left there until the stalks are retted, and some of the 
leaves are gone. It is shocked and taken into the hemp mill. The grower is 
uncertain as to where he stands, and whether the leaves that are 
associated with the straw are in the legal sense Marihuana, referring, of 
course, to that particular clause in the law which refers to dry stalks.
Now this is done as follows: the straw is left on the land in the 
stubble for varying times, as I say, from two weeks or longer during this 
retting process. It is subject to the action of rains and bleaching and 
decomposition with the various effects of bacteria and fungi, but when it 
is taken in, it still retains a trace of the leaves. That is what affects the 
folks up there in Minnesota.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I notice the term "hurds" referred to.

DR. WRIGHT: That is the non-fibrous material crushed and taken away 
from the fibrous. It is the residue. It

25

would be the same as shives in flax.

MR. WOLLNER: I am afraid to say that the experiment with Minnesota 
hemp is rather inconclusive. As I understand it the hemp was bundled 
before it had been permitted to ret for an extended period of time.
It may be we will find that if the hemp is permitted to ret before it 
is stacked, a further decomposition of the drug will ensue. However, we do 
know that the Minnesota hemp of 1934 is active.

DR. WRIGHT: It would be active.

MR. WOLLNER. It is active but whether the activity was retained by 
improper handling of the hemp, I don't know. As I understand it they were 
advised to bunch their hemp before it was retted.

DR. WRIGHT: It was never rotted or retted. The plan of handling in 
Minnesota was unauthorized. In other words, it was contrary to the usual 
procedure. They put the green hemp or the semi-green hemp in a bundle, 
and at a later stage it would be known in the trade as green hemp. That 
was never used for textile purposes. It was not suitable for textile 
purposes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then, Dr. Wright, your opinion is that if 
harvested properly most of the leaves avould remain on the ground and not 
adhere to the stalks?

26

DR. WRIGHT: I will be perfectly frank in telling you that will vary in 
seasonal conditions, and so we are much concerned about that. There are 
leaves left. As to the condition of those leaves, we don't know. They are 
left, and there is no use in denying that. There are considerable left on the 
straw. There are not a great deal, but there are leaves left.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Then prompt harvesting would reduce this 
danger we are now confronted with? 

DR. WRIGHT: It would.

DR. MATCHETT: What about the hemp stacked green in Kentucky; 
doesn't that mold more than that left on the ground?

DR. WRIGHT: Hemp is left in the shock in Kentucky. You will correct 
me Dr. Robinson, if I'm wrong, because it has been fifteen years since I 
was down there, but it is my impression that it is shocked. It is first 
spread and allowed to wilt on the ground.

DR. MATCHETT: Then there is no molding?

DR. WRIGHT: If properly handled there will be no molding. 

MR. WOLLNER: From our point of view that would be improper 
handling; there would be no decomposition of the resin.

27

DR. WRIGHT: The general weathering we would get would be during 
the curing stage.

MR. WOLLNER: How long, about, does that take?

DR. WRIGHT: Now, after it is shocked, cured and stacked, later it is 
spread on the land again and retted.

DR. MATCHETT: But, during this period, of course, it would be in 
excellent condition for smoking, - that is, relatively dry in the stack.

DR. WRIGHT: From the time it is cut until it is rotted, whatever 
leaves there are should be suitable for Marihuana.

MR. SMITH: While we have not found in New York State a large 
agricultural growth, we do find that the largest part of our growth, 
instead of being on good soil, is on poor soil.
For the past two years when I have been looking for wild growth, I 
have found it in dumps or soil that has a high content of ashes or cinders, 
and I have found it trying to grow it in my own garden but the growth does 
not begin to compare with that of the cinder growth, and as a matter of 
fact we have found that most recently the wild growth seeks that kind of 
soil.
That does not prove anything, of course, except we have probably 
most of our wild growth coming from ashes

28

and cinders and public dumps. This did strike me very forcibly, and what 
struck me more forcibly was that we had some of the biggest growths in 
Brooklyn where it was almost a clear cinder dump.
Our experience in New York State so far has not produced anyone who 
desired to be licensed as a cultivator.
I think some of that might be offset if the public was assured that 
the cultivator would have to be licensed, after proper investigation, and 
that definite qualifications exist to establish control.

DR. WRIGHT: As to your first statement about hemp growing on 
cinder beds, wild hemp, - it is not a fibrous hemp. As all of you who are 
familMWith the middle west know, you will find blocks that were 
formerly even cinder beds, but fibrous hemp will not grow there.

MR. SMITH: The point I was chiefly interested in was the public 
interest, where it was grown, whether being produced by chance or design.

DR. WRIGHT: We are hopeful we can clarify this situation. Since 
legislation may be introduced to eradicate or to bring pressure upon the 
legitimate producer, I appreciate your suggestion. I think it is a good one.

MR. SMITH: We have also in New York State given some consideration 
to definite measures for removal, but so far we have operated under 
difficulties acting under nuisance laws. Under the Public Health laws in 
New York, we can fix a penalty for maintaining a public nuisance. We have 
in a few instances removed Marihuana from private property where the 
owner wouldn't undertake it himself, and then assessed a lien against the 
property within the Public Health law on the ground that we have removed 
a public nuisance.

DR. WRIGHT: It might be construed to apply to Marihuana under our 
Public Health regulations in Wisconsin. I do not know whether it has been 
discussed or not.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Robinson, we would like to hear from 
you.

STATEMENT OF DR. B. B. ROBINSON
BUREAU OF PLANT INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

DR. ROBINSON: If fibres produced from plants were ranked in 
accordance with their world production in tonnage, hemp would occupy a 
position of probably third or fourth. It would be surpassed by cotton and 
jute produced in India, and in some years by flax. That gives you some idea 
of where it stands in relative importance.
Dr. Wright mentioned a mattor that many of you are familMWith, the 
fact of the importance that hemp played in our earlier Colonial days 
before the introduction of

30

the cotton gin.
The culture of hemp in the United States, I might ay has decreased 
because of the cheap competitive fibres which are produced by cheap labor 
in foreign countries, and it is because of this cheapness that they are 
substituted for hemp in many cases, and not because of the fact that they 
have characteristics that are better than hemp for cordage or textile 
purposes.
The average world production between the years 1930 and 1954 for 
hemp was about 750,000 tons. And now, during that same period in the 
United States in this small industry we have produced about 500 tons. The 
world production was produced mainly by Russia where I think 56% of the 
fibre is produced, followed by Italy, Yugoslavia, Rumania as other 
producing countries, During the past year or two we imported for domestic 
consumption about 700 to 800 tons a year, so our total consumption, 
including domestically produced fibre, and imported fibre runs about from 
1500 to 2000 tons.
Now, many of you here may wonder why such a small industry as that 
should be favored to continue on, particularly in the light of the 
detrimental character of certain parts of the plant used illegally.
In the first place the United States is dependent


31

upon the foreign production of fibres other than cotton. The United States 
imports annually about 300,000 tons of fibre used for cordage and textile 
purposes. The estimated value last year was about $35,000,000. That does 
not include some importations of India twine.
I do not mean to infer that if hemp were grown in this country, it 
could substitute for all of this 300,000 tons imported, but it is the 
principal fibre which we can get in the United atates, which could be 
substituted in many cases if conditions arose to make it necessary.
The United States, is very thoroughly taken care of at present in 
reference to supplying our own needs on this cordage fibre.
Another argument for the hemp industry is the adaptability of the 
hemp plant to various regions of the country and because of suitability for 
mechanical handling, and these are some of the reasons why the office 
with which I am connected in the Department of Agriculture is interested 
in seeing this small nucleus of hemp industry continued each year until it 
is capable of supporting itself under economic conditions. I am speaking 
more of the industry in Wisconsin rather than the promotional attempts to 
grow hemp in Minnesota which one might speak of an unorthodox 
processing. But this industry we have is capable at the

32

present time of supporting itself if public opinion does not force it to be 
shut doan, or additional restrictions hamper it.
So, this industry could be benefited we naturally think, if this 
Marihuana stigma could be removed. However, the Wisconsin operators are 
not opposed to adjust themselves to the conditions and are very much 
interested in trying to overcome this drug problem.
A couple of years ago when this problem was brought to the front 
more vividly than in the past, the Department of Agriculture was naturally 
interested in it, and the main way we could see to combat it was as to 
how to get around it [sic]. Naturally there might be less restriction on the 
production of hemp in this country if we could prove that in certain 
sections of the country, because of climatic conditions, the drug was not 
active, or if we could possibly get plants of varieties that lack the drug, 
which is probably an Utopian view, or that had it in low concentration.
As a result we cooperated with the Bureau of Narcotics, in setting 
up some experiments. The Bureau of Narcotics has conducted all of the 
chemical work, and Dr. Marchett later on will speak of these tests. I do not 
want to go too much into his field. But, we have attempted under

33

this cooperative work to remove or reduce the resinous substance from 
commercial hemp.
You gentlemen who are chemists and pharmacologists can assist the 
Agricultural program by furnishing the Agriculture Department some 
working tools or some tests by which we can tell the presence or absence 
of this drug, or its activity. It may be said that I am throwing it all on the 
chemists. I am not trying to do that, but we do need something to work 
with.
So far we naturally have resorted to the Beam tests, the 
significance of which we do not know with certainty, but in the work we 
undertook last year, it was the only simple tool which we could work 
with.
Now last summer out at Arlington farm close by, we planted a field 
in which there were 98 small plots of hemp that were set up in 
conformity with the statistical method of analysis of variances by a man 
named Fisher.
We obtained statistically significant differences between the 
varieties using the alkaline but did not obtain it using the acid test. The 
question may arise, then, as to which is the most accurate of the tests in 
measuring the presence or absence of the drug.
In reference to that, the question of the region of the hemp may play 
some importance. The native home of

34

hemp is supposedly in central Asia, and the hemp of Chinese origin which 
has been distributed throughout the world has practically always been 
used for fibre purposes.
The hemp that has come from India has been of the narcotic type and 
has not been cultivated generally for fibre. It has been cultivated for the 
drug. I wish I knew the history of this a little better, but from what I have 
been able to learn from others, hemp does not appear to constitute a 
narcotic problem in China. That is of a fibrous variety, and there is a great 
difference between that hemp and the hemp that came from India. 
With reference to our test at Arlington, the narcotic chemists 
selected samples at three different periods for the acid and alkaline test. 
We got a difference, mathematically significant between those tests. That 
is, the first sampling which I think was in the early part of June, was 
different from the later two samplings in that it was lower in that 
characteristic of activity, the numbers they gave on the Beam test.
Actually, the last test was a little lower than the middle test, but it 
was not significantly lower.
We arranged 8 different fertilizer treatments for the various plots 
and found that the fertilizer used had no effect on the strength or 
incidence either the

35

acid or alkaline test.
Because of the fertilizer result it would appear that soil vs. variations 
that occurred probably did not produce any differences or that the soil does 
not play a part.
With reference to climate, so far we have not made a test for we have 
only had the work at Arlington.  But we plan next summer, if things go well at 
Arlington, to conduct a test in Wisconsin. We have some cooperative agents in 
Mississippi and we thought we could get a test farm there. It has been 
suggested that we try to get one other region, Arizona or New Mexico, or out 
in that section.  So far, we have not made arrangements, but, if we could get 
these various locations in the United States, then we could have a set-up 
whereby we could evolute [sic] climatic conditions in reference to certain 
tests, the Beam test or some other one if you can furnish it. These are the 
results which we have obtained so far in the agricultural program to get away 
from this drug.
There have been several reasons I have not brought out as to why we 
thought we could get somewhere.  We know by handling the plants that some 
of them are very resinous, and some are not.
So, we are receptive to the work you men will do to give us some means 
of testing our plants so as to allow

36

us to produce agriculturally some results which we hope will help the 
industry.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Thank you very muck, Dr. Robinson. You 
recall what I said about the Turkish annual report for the year 1937 in 
which it is said that Cannabis sativa with long stalks is grown for 
industrial purposes in various parts of Anatolia; that the fibre is used for 
the manufacture of ropes and sacks, and its resin content is so slight that 
it could not be used for the extraction of a narcotic drug. It might be 
interesting to get some Turkish seed. 

MR. WOLLNER: We have not had a great deal of success as regards 
those statements. We obtained some seed submitted by Dr. Bouquet and I 
believe Dr. Robinson planted some of them, without any success.

DR. ROBINSON: We planted them under favorable conditions last 
spring. Roughly we may have gotten in the field 200 or 300 plants, and 
after our first Beam test it was estimated we had about 100 left. About 
the first of August, I came back from a trip to the west, and we el-
iminated about two-thirds of the remainder leaving only about 40. I have 
harvested about 20 of these one-half were males, and we sent 10 from 
that collection over to Dr. Matchett to run an alkaline Beam test on. I was

37

able to obtain out of that .about one-third negative and the rest positive.

MR. WOLLNER: Was the amount of resin in these plants comparable to 
that in other plants?

DR. ROBINSON: In harvesting these plants, we merely stripped the 
seed in the field to keep the birds from getting it and I would say that the 
African plant was more resinous than the Manchurian plant. It may be that 
the African plant was later in maturing, but still, by comparison with the 
Manchurian plant, it had more resin. My hand was simply caked with resin 
in stripping the plant for the seed.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: The Indian Government report for 1934 
shows that where they did not have this type of hemp all of the resin was 
imported from Central Asia.
It is stated that the hemp cultivated in Europe does not carry the 
intoxicating properties of Indian hemp. While it is believed that the 
European hemp does not contain as much resin as is to be found in hemp 
usually produced in Asia, the production of the active resin is particularly 
variable, and there are some times great differences in quantity depending 
on the altitude of the place of cultivation.
Are there any questions that you care to ask, Dr.

38

Robinson?

DR. HIBBEN: I would like to ask if you made any experiments 
artificially in the new varieties by radiation?

DR. ROBINSON: We had a program for a number of years on hemp, and 
my predecessor, Mr. Dewey, who unfortunately could not be here this 
morning, reached retirement age three years ago, and our hemp program 
was interrupted.
So far we have not gone into that, but to some extent we have 
considered it. These other methods we have approached seemed to have 
possibilities of results if the tests mean anything.
I think this next spring, we should be able to plant these negative 
seeds we have, and those which have tested negative three different times 
and have been pollinated by plants in three different tests, and we should 
be able to give the chemists something definite to test.

DR. MUNCH: It is my recollection, when Mr. Dewey made a test of the 
original plants growing in Arlington back in 1922, we found different 
physiological portents in the male and the female but, at that time, Mr. 
Dewey had seed he had obtained from various parts of the world, and it is 
my impression that after about three years of cultivation at Arlington, the 
growth characteristics of all of these plants tended to the same type. In 
other

39

words, they all tended to hemp of a certain height, as I say that occurred 
after three years of cultivation.

DR. ROBINSON: I think that more or less that result is obtained. 
Professor Wright who may have had a little closer touch with the problem 
could answer you better. Wouldn't that be your opinion, Professor Wright?

DR. WRIGHT: Yes, under the method used of applying open pollinating, 
that was the tendency as far as our observation went,that they were 
more or less alike.

DR. ROBINSON: In reference to that, these stalks of hemp we obtained 
last year from these various sources, have all been isolated, so they have 
not been cross pollinated.

DR. MUNCH I do not know where Mr. Young of Florence, South Carolina, 
got his idea for the raising of Cannabis for a medicinal purpose -

DR. ROBINSON: He got it from Mr. Dewey.

DR. MUNCH: There was a material decrease in the material before he 
finally abandoned that project.

DR. ROBINSON: I do not know how he obtained it all, or that he 
obtained it all from Mr. Dewey, but as I recall, he did.

DR. MUNCH: There is one other question, and that is as to the method 
by which the seeds themselves were ob-

40

tained,-is that of any interest to you?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes, Dr. Wright, can you give us something 
on the that?

DR. WRIGHT: Commercial seed used for commercial planting?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes.

DR. WRIGHT: I do not have any notes on that. The seed are grown from 
plants cultivated principally for seed; I mean the ordinary hemp which has 
been planted for seed similar to corn. It is planted in rows, all harvested 
by hand, and put in large shocks like those in Kentucky. It is harvested in 
the latter part of September or the first of October in the section in 
which it is grown. Then the shocks are dumped over on large canvasses, 
smoothed out on the ground, and the stubble removed and beat out with 
sticks in the old fashioned method. This is the only place in the United 
States producing this commercially.

DR. MATCHETT: Isn't most of the seed planted here produced in 
foreign countries?

DR. WRIGHT: I do not get the question.

DR. MATCHETT: Aren't most of the seeds produced in foreign 
countries?

DR. WRIGHT: Most of the seed produced for Commercial purposes 
originated in China, central China or towards

41

the south part of China and was carried here for cultivation.

MR. WOLLNER: I believe what Dr. Matchett means is the commercial 
crop that is grown for instance in Wisconsin, does that originate from 
seed grown in Kentucky, or the Far East?

DR. WRIGHT: All of the hemp planted in the United States for 
commercial purposes comes from Kentucky. That is, all of the legitimate 
hemp comes from seed grown in Kentucky. Does that answer the question? 
DR. MATCHETT: Yes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Matchett, you have been collaborating 
with Dr. Robinson in these experiments at Arlington. Can you tell us what 
results you obtained? Dr. Robinson has told us quite a lot about the 
results, but I think you can probably elaborate upon them.

DR. MATCHETT: First of all I might state we made these tests in the 
manner that was published by us last year, and in the treatment we 
divided the tests into six categories, according to the depth of color that 
we obtained, beginning with zero for negative plants. These plants which, 
gave us only traces of color, which we felt should not be overlooked, but 
which we also felt would not constitute wholly satisfactory 
identification of the

42

plant, were designated number one.

Those plants characterized as 2, gave strong responses, definitely 
positive, and those as 3, 4, and 5 responded with increasing intensity in 
that order.

Briefly we found on variety No. 1, a Rumanian variety 97.5% of the 
plants tested would have been satisfactorily identified by the Beam test. 
That is assuming for the moment the single test would be sufficient, 
which I believe is generally understood not to be so.

Variety No. 2, another Rumanian variety, gave us 100%.

Variety No. 3, the third Rumanian variety, 87% of satisfactory 
response.

Variety No. 5, Manchuria, 22.9% satisfactory response. 

Variety No. 6, Chinese, 13.8% satisfactory. 

Variety No. 9, Italian, 98.1%

There is a very decided difference between the Chinese, and 
Manchurian varieties on the one hand and the Rumanian and Italian 
varieties on the other.

Now there were some very interesting things in reference to the 
differences between the three test periods.

It is true that there was one rather decided change, particularly in 
the second test, but there was not as significant difference between the 
number of negative plants, nor was the difference worked with reference 
to

43

category No. l.

The interesting thing was where we had many in category 2 in the 
first testing, in the next testing a considerable increase appeared in 
category 4, with a corresponding decrease in category 2.

The actual number of negative plants was not significantly 
different. I believe the first test gave us 36, the second test 32, and the 
third test 40.

During the course of our activities we found that molding had no 
apparent effect on one alkaline test response of either negative or 
positive plants. We permitted them to mold in a. very moist place for a 
period of five weeks. There was no change in the Beam test.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I want to ask Dr. Wright a question. In 
harvesting the plant, Doctor, we understand that the farmer usually 
harvests it before the resin reaches its highest stage. Is that true?

DR. WRIGHT: I will say yes, not knowing when the highest stage of 
the resin is reached myself, but from what I could gather from talking to 
Mr. Wollner and Dr. Link and those most familiar with the subject. It is cut 
in the mid-blossom stage, and from what I understand the plants are 
usually expected to have a high content of resin at that time.

44

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our eradication program, 16,000 acres 
have been gone over, and as I understand it we will also have to go over 
that same acreage during the coming year, and probably the third year. Do 
you know how long that seed will remain dormant in the soil? 

DR. WRIGHT: I can only give you some guess on that. It is quite 
variable, and how long the seed will remain in the soil is simply my guess. 
If it is harvested the first year, before pollination occurs I would expect 
that to handle the situation under most circumstances. I am basing that on 
practical observation and experience, but if there is a repetition and the 
plant does become a volunteer plant, if the same process as followed for 
two years we could expect almost complete eradication. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What seed could replace the hemp seed as 
bird food? There is a lot of growth throughout the country due to the 
casting about of bird seed. Now, however we require sterilization of hemp 
seed. We have not reached the 100% point in sterilization but the seed 
people tell us they should sell the seed in 5% mixtures; but even 5%, 
mixtures if the seed is not properly sterilized, might produce some wild 
growth. Have you any suggestions on that?

45

DR. WRIGHT: I believe that these gentlemen here from the animal 
biology department might be better able to judge of that than I am.

DR., COUCH: As a matter of fact, I do not know anything on that point, 
and we have not gone into it at all. I am extremely interested however.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think there should be some discussion 
as to the relative activities between the male and the female plants.

DR. BLATT: May I ask a question of Dr. Robinson? As I understand it, 
the average production is about 500 tons a year. Is that 500 tons of fibre?

DR. ROBINSON: Yes. This past summer, we had 1300 acres of hemp 
produced commercially in this country, and it has been running about that 
acreage with the exception that in 1934 and 1935 this acreage appeared in 
Minnesota, and in 1936 and 1937 we had a big acreages in Illinois, but 
those were acreages planted, you might say, for other purposes than the 
ordinary use, for there was an idea of producing fibre as a substitute for a 
wool and various things of that nature. Those industries that attempted to 
do that, for one reason or another, have dropped by the wayside, and 1000 
to 1500 acres is the normal hemp production each year in the United 
States.

46

MR. WOLLNER: Professor Wright, you heard Commissioner Anslinger's 
question for information on the relationship between male and female 
plants. You are undoubtedly aware of most of the discussions in the past 
years on the subject of Marihuana, and that it has centered around the 
female plant. As a matter of fact, I believe the United States 
Pharmacopoeia refers to the flowering type of the female plant, and it is 
stated that Marihuana comes mostly from the female plant. I wonder 
whether historically that might not have arisen from the fact that 
possibly the male plant flowered at an earlier period than the female 
plant in the growth of the plant itself, and at the time of harvesting by 
force of circumstance they were limited to harvesting female tops.

DR. WRIGHT: Not actually knowing it, I could not say, of course, but I 
am sure that is the answer. In the male plant the leaves drop off long 
before, the female plant, and when the traffickers have reached the plant 
the leaves have practically all gone from the male, but the females are 
luxuriant.

MR. LEVINE: Is there any distinction between the fiber of males and 
females?

DR. WRIGHT: You see, in fibre, they are cut at an early stage when the 
female plants are just forming the

47

bud, and the male plants just shedding the pollen.

MR. WOLLNER: Then the male plant would grow as tall as the female 
plant.

DR. WRIGHT: Yes, they do usually reach the same height.
MR. WOLLNER. When produced for fibre, the plant does not reach the 
height we experienced in Arlington.

DR. WRIGHT: It has reached its full height when cut for fibre. You 
planted it in rows, too, which would add to the height.

MR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Professor Wright a question as to 
whether or not there was any quantity of Cannabis raised in this country 
for commercial drug purposes.

DR. WRIGHT: I cannot answer that question.

DR. ROBINSON: Undoubtedly there are others here who could furnish 
that information. I do not know of a single case where any of it has been 
furnished companies for that purpose, but I think there are companies that 
get it for that purpose.

MR. SMITH: There was a concern that grew it in Indianapolis several 
years ago for their own purposes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Most of the pharmaceutical houses before 
enactment of Federal Marihuana Legislation

48

obtained their Cannabis supply from the Middle West. There was relatively 
little importation of Cannabis for medical purposes.

DR. COUCH: In the Food and Drug Administration, we occasionally see 
a questionnaire sent to the importers more or less of the patent medicine 
type, and also some well known pharmaceutical houses where cannabis is 
still found in the formula for certain products. Under the Pure Food and 
Drug Act, we have some requirements on that, and we are informed what 
the source of it is, whether gotten in this country or through importation.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think the stocks of some of the larger 
houses who are still putting this out are sufficient to carry them over for 
a considerable period of time. Some of the firms transferred or sold their 
product to other houses, but I know of a number of occasions where raw 
material was obtained in this country for the local trade.

DR. WRIGHT: I have been informed by Doctors that they did get a 
considerable amount of their prepared processed material from Mexico. I 
was wondering if there was any processing plant in Mexico.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I did not know they imported it for 
medical uses from Mexico.

49

DR. MUNCH: Many of the commercial manufacturers have grown it, but 
because of the extreme variability of the potency of the material they 
were growing themselves, they attempted to import it from Madras or 
Bombay. But the material imported was often weaker than that grown in 
this country. So the next step was to purchase from Mr. Young at 
Charleston, South Carolina, or the general neighborhood of Lexington, 
Kentucky, or Nantou, Illinois. But, those sources folded up within the last 
ten years and there has not been any substantial production of material in 
the United States since then. I tested most of the material grown in this 
country that has been offered.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I suppose that seed came from Kentucky, 
which in turn came from China.

DR. MUNCH: That is true, but I have tested material grown in the 
United States commercially that was more potent in its physiological 
aspects than that imported from India.

MR. FULLER: I think that came about as a result of the interest that 
developed in the production of it during the war, or just before we got into 
the war, because at that time I was in the field myself and grew it com-
mercially for four or five years in Virginia from that same stock of seed 
that Young used in South Carolina, and

50

which was obtained from the Bureau of Plant Industry. I do not know 
whether he got it from Dewey or not.

The plan we adopted was to cull out as much as possible the tall 
plants for purely commercial reasons. We could not get so much material 
from the tall plants. In other words, bushy plants grew up six and seven 
feet high, giving much more drug than those that grew up taller but not so 
bushy, When we considered it the proper time, you would grab hold of it. It 
felt like a sponge. We collected enough material then to produce a drug 
very much more potent than any imported material that came into the 
country.

It was our experience that it really did not make much difference 
where the hemp came from, after it had been grown here and become 
acclimated to our conditions you could select bushy plants from it, and it 
was just as potent. It did not make any difference where it came from. We 
used to cull our plants, particularly the male plants. I used to think it did 
not have much effect, but be that as it may, that was what we did. I do not 
think we could have ever used the male plants anyway for, in stripping, 
the amount of material obtained was so small.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How did you strip the plant?

MR. FULLER: It was a very easy process. It was done by women, and 
they used gloves. In all of the years we

51

were producing that material as far as we knew, there never was a case of 
where anybody used it for illegitimate purposes. In fact at that time, I do 
not think there was any Marihuana used. But, it did not pay us to go on.

I think a great deal of the Cannabis sold in the drug trade came from 
the wild materials that grew in the Middle West and one of the largest 
dealers in drugs handled that crop. I knew him very well, and he told me at 
the time.

DR. BROMBERG: What further preparation was there after stripping 
for medicinal purposes?

MR. FULLER: We just baled it and sold it.

DR. BROMBERG: Any other processing necessary?

MR. FULLER: In the manufacturing of medicinals, it has to be 
extracted usually with alcohol end concentrated down to a solid extract. 
There was no attempt, and I do not think there has been any attempt made, 
to separate for commercial purposes the active principle, for even with 
all of the work done, we do not know what it is.

MR. WOLLNER: Did you find, Mr. Fuller, in your growth of the plant 
commercially, that arid seasons or drier seasons would increase, or 
produce an increased quantity of resin?

52

MR. FULLER: I do not think we noticed any difference. Now, I was in 
that portion of Virginia very near to Washington on the first plateau, six 
or eight miles out, and some of those summers were very dry. We would 
get sometimes six weeks without rain, and it did not seem to affect the 
yield at all. One season, I recall particularly, there was a great deal of 
rain, and the crop was just about the same.

MR. WOLLNER: I would like to offer this thought to the Department of 
Agriculture. The statement is invariably made by people in Europe and the 
Far East and Near East that the amount of resin produced by a plant is in a 
measure proportionate to the rainfall, and the less rainfall the more resin. 
I wonder whether we are actually dealing with the question of the 
variation in the amount of resin produced as against the amount of resin 
exuded. That is to say, isn't it possible as a result of a condition, all that 
happens is the plant structure, so to speak, shrinks to evaporation and 
greater amount of resin appears on the surface, but the absolute quantity 
contained by the flowering tops and the leaves is the same ?

DR. ROBINSON: I think your point is well taken, and it was my 
intention to go into some of those points

53

in those tests throughout the United States. We collected material 
over at Arlington Farm last summer at various stages for the purpose of 
making a microtome test of these little pockets. So far we have not had 
time to do very much on that, and there are gentlemen here who have done 
more. We actually found those pockets present in pants two weeks old and 
on varying specimens which we have in our office. We want back to plants 
that were less [than] three weeks old and we found there hashish material. 
Now in older plants in some of the specimens we have of Indian hemp, it 
seemed to be exuded from the cells all over the surface, and I imagine in 
such plants as that, if it exuded if you touched it, much more would come 
off than if it had not exuded. Is that what you mean, certain climatic 
conditions would cause cells to erupt, and the viscosity of the exudate 
would be such that it would spread.

MR. WOLLNER: I am thinking in terms of opium or the poppy. You can 
get opium from the pod without scarifying, and the thought struck me, in 
the case of Cannabis, since the leaf is always extracted in this country, 
and since in the past the process has been of rubbing it from the outside, 
in the East, they get more resin than we do, due to the fact that more has 
exuded but not
54

more produced.

DR. HIBBEN: There is another factor involved in the question about 
rainfall, and the formation of resin, and that is perhaps the production of 
resin would depend upon the amount of sunshine, and the more rainfall, the 
less sunshine. In tomato plants for example, the Department of 
Agriculture has done a great deal of experimentation as to foliage, and [it] 
has been shown that the quantity of foliage depends greatly upon the 
duration of sunshine the plant has received.

MR. WOLLNER: I had not thought of that. 

DR. HIBBEN: Some plants require a great deal of sunshine. 

DR. WRIGHT: May I ask you this question, - I was interested in the 
fact that you selected the bushy plant believing it more profitable to do 
that. 

MR. FULLER: Yes.

DR. WRIGHT: Did you have any observations at all to indicate they 
were more potent or more satisfactory to the purchaser than the more 
slender plants; have you any reason to believe there is a difference 
between the two?

MR. FULLER: No, I do not think there is any difference, for the green 
leaf from the male plant yields resin, and as far as we could determine, 
the resin was just as

55

potent as the female. You do not get so much per plant. That was 
what we were interested in, but, as far as quality is concerned, I do not 
think there was any difference.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: And now, Gentlemen, if we have no more 
questions on the agricultural phase of the problem we will proceed to a 
little more controversial subject. The pharmacological phase. I would like 
to have Dr. Munch give us a little history of the pharmacology of 
Marihuana.

STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES C. MUNCH
PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOLOGY 
TEMPLE UNIVERSITY

DR. MUNCH: So far as the external effects are concerned of the fluid 
extract of Cannabis, the effects are hyperesthesia, fomication, and cold 
extremities. These cause increase in intensity. It is not local.

So far as the gastro-intestinal tract is concerned, there is no effect upon 
the taste. There is a tendency towards an increase in thirst and appetite, 
and large doses will cause nausea, emesis, vomiting, and the drugs 
produced diarrhea or constipation.
So far as the effect on the brain, I am only going into that to this 
extent, to say that in connection with USPVIII which was thirty years ago 
we were interested

in knowing whether the American grown plant could be used as well as 
that which had been imported from India. The study made by the American 
Drug Manufacturers Association and by others at that time led the USP 
official Committee to the stand that either the Indian or the American 
grown material would be comparable for medicinal purposes so long as it 
was tested and found to have a certain physiological effect, and from a 
number of bio-tests that were made in which the material was 
administered to dogs, there were three different effects produced, one 
effect being to cause the dog to sway from side to side, and back and 
forth, and finally not to be able to stand erect at all. It was then that 
satisfactory material was produced which would produce such a response.
When it became necessary to prepare revised standards for world 
use of the Cannabis, we standardized the standards. First, we obtained 
material from various manufacturers in this country representing the 
ordinary strength or potency of the product and then many of these 
manufacturers told me of the material of ten or twenty or thirty years 
before, and they gave me the products or materials which were of the 
same commercial strength as they have always been marketing.

Then through various means, we obtained drugs and

57

standardized those products, that is thirteen different products of this 
series of drugs. Those products were then mixed, and constituted the USP 
fluid extract of Cannabis, which was officially recognized in USP X.

Then as to the method of bio-assay. Contrary to much of the 
published literature we find that dogs vary as greatly in their response as 
do humans. On. some 500 dogs I have used, fully one-half were very 
insensitive, and were discarded immediately. The nervous type or short-
haired dog is usually a satisfactory animal but not necessarily the best.

Going back to the pharmacological action, so far as the causes, and 
effect on circulation, a small dose causes rapid beating of the heart which 
may be followed by less than normal. The blood pressure is usually 
unchanged, or there is a slight fall.

So far as the blood is concerned, there is a definite increase in the 
hypoglycemiacal content. At the same time, there is a definite increase in 
the blood sugar. Enormous doses have produced death by cardiac failure, 
but the doses were 100 to 200 times doses, which produced a tremendous 
physiological effect.

If smoked, there is a tendency to choking or coughing, and all doses 
tend to decrease the respiratory needs.

58

So far as the muscles are concerned, the muscles show a definite 
confusion, and with very large doses there are shown flexor spasms. But 
not with a therapeutic dose.

So far as the pupils of the eyes themselves, there is a very definite 
contraction of the conjunctiva, and usually but not always a dilation of 
the pupil.

So far as the effect on the glands, there is probably a double 
diuretical effect. There is a question, and the production of the diuretic 
effect is unsettled.

It has been reported there is a sexually stimulating effect. Some say 
it does and some say it does not exist.

So far as antidotes are concerned the thought is, if it has been 
swallowed, the administration of an emetic, caffeine or acid drinks in 
general.

So far as the habituation is concerned, it has been claimed and 
denied, and so far as elimination is concerned, I have not been able to 
detect it in the urine. So, I do not believe the active principle is 
eliminated by urine.

In the general pharmacopoeia developed by O'Shaunessy in 1843, 
which reached its peak ten or fifteen years later, it was clinically 
recommended for all sorts of diseases and later found worthless.

There is a definite decrease in the central Indian

59

drug which stimulated further work done by Casparis and others, after 
which it appears to have gone into innocuous desuetude until it began to be 
criminally exploited, which led to the present burst of study.

Pharmacology is right I think, when it is said it does not have the 
same effect, or one effect on the brain, and I may be sticking my head out 
when I make a suggested answer that the cause of the awful intoxication 
is largely due to the difference in the rate of absorption, whether the 
material is smoked or given by solution or in capsules and taken into the 
stomach, or given rectally, and also the susceptibility on the brain, 
because in many instances we have given the same material to humans or 
dogs. Some of the animals it has shown no effect upon, others it has 
shown an enormous effect with the same dose. So far as animals are 
concerned, we have made a comparative study and find that dogs and 
rabbits have proven most suitable for quantitative assays but none can be 
relied on for qualitative accuracy, that is 10 to 12%. That is a complete 
change from what I said in my book,1 but it is possible, by running from 14 
to 20 bio-assay, to obtain results accurate within plus or minus 11 to 
20%. But, it never has been done commercially and can only be done in 
connection with research.

60

Through what channels does the active principle find its way into 
the nerve centers? I should say through the blood.
So far as the effect on the blood pressure, I have attempted to cover 
those reflex changes. It has been stated and denied that there are 
significant lesions in the brain of humans. Dogs I have used for some 
years, in some instances showed certain types of brain changes. Whether 
those are connected with Cannabis, I do not know. I am trying to complete 
that now and perhaps within the next five years I can answer the question.
Regarding the other questions, I would rather refer those to Dr. 
Bromberg.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Before we enter into a general discussion, I 
would like to call on Dr. Loewe of Cornell University to give us a 
statement on the bio-assay method.

STATEMENT OF DR. S. LOEWE
PHARMACOLOGIST 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL COLLEGE

DR. LOEWE: The bio-assay, in my opinion, is the point where the 
pharmacologist has to enter this manifold picture at which we arrive in 
this conference for a very significant reason.

61

The reason is that all the manifold aspects of Marihuana are focused 
around and makes the existence of an active principle in this drug, active 
principles which are chemically not known, and as long as an active 
principle is not chemically known, it can only be determined from its 
action, that is, biologically, which can only be by bio-assay.

Dr. Munch has thoroughly depicted the many aspects of the 
pharmacological action of Marihuana. That is what we can call the 
pharmacological spectrum of this drug, But it must be emphasized, that 
the spectrum of the drug as such and not on one certain active principle 
necessarily, for nobody knows the active principle, and nobody ever knows 
whether there is only one active principle or more than one active 
principle.

It can be assumed from the beginning that there is more than one 
active principle but this must not necessarily concern the Marihuana 
interests, because the problem is narrowed to that active principle among 
possibly many active principles which produces the narcotic or "dope" 
action in humans.

Even with respect to this point, of course, we are not one hundred 
percent sure that this is the action of one principle or more than one.

62

Quantitative bio-assay of the active principle of Marihuana, of 
course, tends or aims to determine that one active principle or a complex 
of active principles, which is interesting from the human point of view, 
the narcotic principle. May I mention right here that as long as we do not 
know how many active principles there are, we have to assume primarily 
that every action is carried by a separate active principle, and with this 
assumption, may I speak for the definite ataxia principle, which is the 
principle which can be bio-assayed in the drug which produces the main 
action stored in the dog. There is another action in the drug, which I may 
call the depressant action, the cataleptic action, and then there is the 
anesthetic principle which can be studied in the rabbit, using the 
depression of the corneal reflex. The depressant action in the mouse, 
manifested by prolonging the hypnotic action, is an action which I have 
observed and used to bio-assay this one active principle.

Now, bio-assay has to start, therefore, with this, which one of these 
actions is preferable for the Marihuana problem for studying the narcotic 
principle, important for humans?

We have much evidence that the ataxia action is fairly well related 
to the narcotic action.

63

In detail, there is not much to say. Walton has elaborated the 
previous effects and experiences of the bio-assay of the drug in a fairly 
good manner. There are details, and certainly it is necessary to bio-assay 
a large number of animals due to the individual natures and non-
susceptibility which complicates the actions, and action can only be 
compared in one and the same animal, and only for comparison in a single 
animal, and the consequence is that a large group of animals has to be 
used.

The mode of administration has been emphasized by Dr. Munch. I 
would prefer and do prefer, for bio-assay, intravenous administration 
because the Marihuana action has a very long period of latency without the 
means of elimination from the system, so that the results seem to be 
fairly well comparable.

Now, I am of the opinion, just like Dr. Munch has emphasized, that 
the bio-assay method of the drug is not definitely eliminated. I have the 
impression that the method will result in fairly good accuracy, but it is an 
accuracy of plus or minus 15 or 20%, and which will suffice, I suppose, for 
the period in which bio-assay is necessary.

It is the unfortunate situation of the pharmacologist that in certain 
periods of development of active princi-

64

ples he is available for the purpose, and in a certain sense he is the man 
charged with the entire problem.  But, his unfortunate situation is that 
just when he has developed this method and applied it, it is always finally 
inherent that he is out of the picture for, as soon as the chemist comes 
into the picture, and the bio-assay is not any more necessary, the 
pharmacologist can be dropped.  If I may mention this at random, all of 
these points of view are true also as to the chemical test.  Before the 
chemist has developed the active principle, the chemical method of 
identification of much or great importance to the country, and they may be 
of much or less importance for identifying the active principles than are 
the bio-assay methods, but only after the discovery of the active principle 
and its chemical properties, the problem of the chemical test, the 
importance of the Beam test can become clear.
I know of another example where a greater activity of a certain drug 
was found, and the drug was not white but yellow, and this, of course, 
introduced many beliefs that yellow colors and opticals would be an easy 
expedient for getting a quantitative activity.  So, there was developed a 
number of tests for this drug, going into this problem, but finally it turned 
out what general color

65

of the narcotic or commodity was and the reason for the high activity of 
the drug.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Well, Doctor, we are going to have the 
chemists confer among themselves, and they will then give us some of 
their views. I think we can reserve the general discussion for the 
afternoon.

We will now hear from Dr. Walter Bromberg, Senior Psychiatrist of 
the Department of Hospitals, City of New York.

STATEMENT OF DR. WALTER BROMBERG
SENIOR PSYCHIATRIST 
DEPARTMENT OF HOSPITALS, CITY OF NEW YORK.

DR. BROMBERG: To start with, my interest in this Marihuana problem 
began in 1933 when I reported at Bellevue Hospital a group of 11 cases of 
mental reactions induced by smoking Marihuana and I reviewed the 
literature and medical knowledge at that time. Also, the experience which 
I obtained was at the Psychiatric Clinic of the Court of General Sessions 
over a period of six years. Persons showing overt mental symptoms were 
brought to the hospital by interested relatives and occasionally on a 
magistrate's order. For that reason, the vast majority of Marihuana 
smokers did not reach the hospital. Cases which came before the Clinic 
had passed through the Court of General Sessions and had been arraigned, 
indicted and

66

convicted of a felony.

There has been considerable literature on the intoxication and 
insanity-producing effect of Cannabis, in papers from Asia, Europe, and 
the United States. To sum up this material concisely, it can be said that 
the several types of syndromes recognized fall into three groups: (a) 
intoxication, (b) toxic psychosis with or without admixture of other types 
of mental reactions (schizophrenia, manic-depressive) and (c) according 
to Eastern European and Asiatic observers, chronic dementia and 
deterioration following prolonged use of the drug. Apparently this latter 
type of deteriorating process has not been observed in American clinics.

Our experience with mental conditions following Marihuana indicate 
to us that there are two categories of mental reaction. The following 
classification is suggested:

Acute intoxication (Marihuana Psychosis) Containing sensory, motor 
and subjective elements, lasting hours to several days, often with anxiety 
or hysterical reactions, and panic states and depressions of transient 
nature.
Toxic Psychoses (a) in which there are many admixtures of disturbed 
sensorlum, delusional and emotional reactions amounting to psychosis, but 
with the common characteristic
67

toxic signs and (b) functional psychoses of a typical variety, initiated by 
Marihuana or colored by Marihuana in their symptomatology, but which 
continue in the form of the underlying psychosis. In these cases Marihuana 
represents an incipient stage in the psychosis, apparently.

There were 14 cases of Acute Intoxication and 17 of Toxic 
psychosis.

The point at which the line is drawn between acute intoxicating due 
to Marihuana and psychosis due to Marihuana depends on the degree and 
severity of the symptoms. Acute intoxications, induced by smoking one to 
four cigarettes, bring about after an interval varying from one-half to five 
hours in the individual one or all of the following symptoms: an increase 
in motor activity, a feeling of excitement, mental confusion, 
disorientation, crowding of perception, elementary visual illusions and 
hallucinations, euphoria and talkativeness. In addition to these symptoms, 
numerous subjective experiences occur, such as increased speed of 
thought processes, a feeling of intellectual brilliance, change in time 
perception, various somatic feelings, dizziness, hunger, a feeling of 
swelling of the head, lightness of the extremities, a sensation of walking 
on air, lengthening of the limbs and sexual illusions. More often sex 
excitement consists

68

in the fact that the possible sexual objects in his environment 
become extraordinarily desirable. There is abundant evidence in our 
clinical and experimental material to show that the stimulus for sexual 
interest and activity derives from the aesthetic enhancement of objects 
in the environment. It is not so much a matter of increased potency on the 
part of the user as increased reaction to sexual fantasies and illusions. 
One of our patients said: "I saw black and white women lying in bed with 
legs separated, as if expecting men . . . some women in the park with 
nothing on, doing nasty dances, moving their hips. I chased after them." 
Others state women appear amazingly beautiful. Another patient said: "In 
the subway I felt very sexy. I wanted to touch every woman that passed."

The speeded-up physical motility has its counterpart in rapid 
speech. There is a feeling on the part of the individual that he is witty, 
even brilliant; his ideas flow quickly and words come readily to the 
tongue. Conclusions and answers seem to come to mind ready-formed and 
surprisingly clear, without the effort of thinking. This feelings of clarity 
is, of course, spurious. Actually the productions of the intoxicant are hard 
to follow, for when he wishes to explain what he has thought there is

69

only confusion. The rapid flow of ideas gives a subjective 
impression of brilliance of thought and observation. The sense of 
increased speed of thinking apparently has an effect on memory - hence 
the confusion that appears on trying to recall what was thought during the 
intoxication.

The smoker finds it pleasant to be with others and to impart his 
experiences to them. This is reflected in the fact that Marihuana is 
ordinarily smoked at parties or in groups. It is felt that this need for a 
social setting is a reaction to an inner anxiety arising from the threat of 
bodily destruction implied in somatic illusions induced by Marihuana In 
the ordinary case of smoking Marihuana, especially with one who is used 
to the drug, this threat becomes converted to euphoria which develops to 
uncontrollable fits of laughter. Nevertheless inquiry shows that almost 
every smoker is aware of definite uneasiness at the outset of the 
intoxication. The description from smokers in Harlem and from 
experimental subjects agrees on this point. In the words of a user of two 
years' standing, initiates "shrink together, feel tight inside and get 
frightened." After they smoke it more than once, the reality of these 
frightening somatic illusions becomes less. In occasional instances, and 
these are the cases

70

which are apt to come to medical attention, the fear of death, of insanity, 
of bodily deformity and of bodily dissolution are startling. These patients 
are tense, nervous, frightened, they may develop a state of panic. Often 
suicide or assaultive acts are the result of these emotional states. The 
anxiety state is so common in patients admitted to the hospital for 
uncomplicated Marihuana psychosis, that it can be considered part of the 
intoxication syndrome.

Notes taken on experimental subjects who were psychologically 
trained illustrate these points:

Subject l. Two cigarettes were smoked within 40 minutes. 
Immediately after the second a feeling of lightness in vertex of head was 
felt. Head was expanding; there was a feeling of mild excitement. Now the 
head felt heavy and there was a definite feeling of lengthening in the legs 
and a tension in the back muscles of the thigh. Head felt alternately light 
and heavy. There was a sensation as though the top of the head were lifted 
with about four inch increase in height, accompanied by optic images of 
skulls and skeletons. Feeling of the arms rising up in the air.
Subject was aware of a feeling of confusion. Suddenly he saw 
images of legs and arms in a dissecting

71

room which were terrifying.
Subject 2. "I felt a little euphoric at first, but with the first draw 
my heart feels faster, my eyes a little heavier. I feel myself perspiring all 
over, and shaking. I can feel a slight dizziness. I feel weak; the dizziness 
has left and I am perspiring (Asked to walk around the room. Refuses to do 
so and becomes negativistic).
On looking back I remembered that I had sexual thoughts during the 
time of the experiment. Time seems to pass in a peculiar way, there being 
a combination of fastness and slowness. I took my first inhalation a few 
minutes after 9 and when I looked at the clock and saw it was 10 after 9. I 
was very much surprised because it seemed like hours. The whole 
experiment seems now as if it lasted much longer than it did. Walking 
home I walked slowly in front of oncoming cars and felt a sense of 
recklessness connected with not being able to walk faster and not caring."

It is remarkable how much anxiety is developed when one looks for 
experimental subjects among laymen. The drug is popularly supposed to 
release aggressive and sexual impulses beyond the point of control; it is 
also regarded as being habit-forming. The legendary history and social 
connotation of hashish smoking may help to de-

72

velop in those who have had no experience with the drug, a series of 
anxieties masking sexual fantasies and aggressive impulses. This has 
come almost to the point of mass hysteria. Some public officials are 
unwilling to allow the use of Marihuana cigarettes for experimentation 
purposes, on the ground that it may be "immoral," tending to foster the 
development of drug addiction among the public. This frequent anxiety 
concerning Cannabis may have as its source the feeling of dissolution and 
other somatic changes induced in smokers which is communicated 
somehow to the non-smoking public.

In clinical material as indicated, Marihuana effects may range from 
mild intoxications to transitory psychoses which require psychiatric aid. 
The effects vary and not all the symptoms occur in every case. Illustrative 
of the Marihuana psychosis with anxiety reactions, and somatic sensory 
distortions:
A 31 year old white man, admitted March 27, 1934, with a history of 
having smoked just one cigarette. On admission the patient was depressed, 
retarded, apprehensive. He admitted smoking Marihuana. Was oriented and 
memory showed no defects. Physical examination was negative. The 
patient states, "My hand began to feel blue all of a sudden. I felt like 
laughing and I felt

73

funny in my head. it was the queerest feeling I ever had. I felt like I was 
kind of fainting away like. I sweat and then Id get kind of chilly. I got the 
scare of my life. I thought I was going to die and everything else. I knew 
what was happening all the time. I thought my hands were beginning to get 
blue. My throat began to get kind of dry. It was a little better than getting 
drunk. I did not want to step down from the curbit seemed to be so high. I 
was sitting down and was afraid to get up." Patient improved and on the 
second day was less apprehensive, was pleasant and cheerful. He was 
discharged as recovered, after two days.

This case demonstrates visual illusions, which recall the 
megalopsia (perceiving objects larger than they are), and more common 
micropsia, which has been reported experimentally and clinically. It is 
this type of illusion, induced by hashish, that may have been the basis for 
the story of Aladdin who saw the tremendous genie emerge from his lamp 
spout in the Arabian Nights' tale.

A 32 year old Irish-American, admitted September 17, 1937, with a 
history of smoking Marihuana cigarettes two hours prior to admission. He 
felt dizzy, wanted to commit suicide by jumping out of windows, bumping 
head on the wall, floor, etc. On admission was uneasy, ap-

74

prehensive, impulsive. Said, "I feel sick. I'm going through hell. I saw 
trucks coming at me getting larger and I wanted to open the door of the 
cab and jump out." He was discharged as improved in his own custody 
about 12 hours after admission.

A common type of intoxication is indicated in the following case:

A 38 year old Negro, admitted April 13, 1934, with history that he 
had run out of the house poorly clad and that he had smoked "artificial" 
cigarettes. He was confused on admission, was dazed in appearance and 
disoriented. He described a lightness of the head, dizziness and seeing 
star-shaped figures before his eyes after smoking a "doped" cigarette. He 
was apprehensive on examination. On the second or third day after 
admission, apprehension had disappeared and he was discharged as 
recovered, being clear, composed, but unable to account for his earlier 
excitement.

It is not uncommon to find the history of admixture of other drugs or 
alcohol in Cannabis intoxication. Frequently alcohol intensifies the 
Cannabis symptomatology.

A 27 year old man of old American stock, admitted on June 18, 1933, 
at his own request. He had been a chronic alcoholic and displayed definite 
evidences of psycho-

75

pathic makeup; had marked inferiority because of his eyes and body 
structure. On admission he appeared to be apprehensive, a little excited, 
spoke coherently and relevantly. His experiences were rather clearly set 
forth--"I was down on the water-front. A fellow gave me an Egyptian 
cigarette to smoke . . . it was hashish. About an hour afterwards I began to 
see things. I'd see things flying in the air. This made me laugh and I'd laugh 
at things not worth laughing at. Then I began to see green and other colors 
flowing before my eyes. Then things got black. I imagined people were 
following me and I screamed in my hotel and got kicked out. I still see red 
lines in front of my eyes and other different colors all stuck together. 
Then I began to hear bells that would get fainter and fainter and then start 
again. Imagined someone was after me all evening. I thought I heard 
footsteps and saw people ducking in and out of doorways behind. me. At 
the time I said to myself maybe it all affect my eyes. I seen a big splotch 
in front of me  it was scarlet very bright, exceptionally bright. It 
contracted, then faded away. I knew all the time it was due to hashish."

The second group comprises cases of toxic psychosis due to or 
initiated by Cannabis. There may be other

76

toxic agents present, as alcohol, other drugs, infective or other 
endogenous elements. Disordered sensorium, excitement and agitation, 
retardation, blocking with emotional rigidity, hallucinations, sensations 
of somatic change, delusional experiences may appear in the toxic 
psychosis. The psychosis lasts from weeks to months. Often the mental 
picture crystallizes out into a schizophrenic or manic depressive 
psychosis after several weeks or months (see paradigm). At the onset .of 
the illness what can be considered characteristic Cannabis symptom-
atology is discernible. As the underlying functional psychosis develops, 
the toxic elements recede.

A boy of 16, admitted February 27, 1934, with statement from the 
family that for two months he had been depressed, apprehensive, worried, 
scratching his hands in a nervous manner, prayed constantly. He 
complained that somebody read his thoughts. On admission was well 
developed and showed no physical signs. Patient was agitated, depressed, 
talked constantly in a bizarre manner about the devil influencing him, etc. 
Said: "I felt lightly when I was walking - as if I weighed only 10 pounds. I 
felt like running my whole body was light. I felt like jumping. As if I was 
walking on air. I felt happy. Then I saw yellow lights all around me. I saw 
blue and green

77

too. The colors were more bright than usual. There are just masses of 
colors - sometimes I see a black cross with everything red behind it. That 
means there is a God. He is helping me. The devil knows the evil thoughts 
in me." This agitated condition improved and patient was discharged about 
3 weeks after admission as a psychosis due to drugs; acute hallucinatory 
episode.

Patient was readmitted August 1st of that year with a picture of a 
depression with schizoid features. On this admission there were no 
evidences whatever of the sensory illusions and somatic feelings that he 
had previously when he smoked Marihuana. He was transferred to the state 
hospital, where he remained four years, being diagnosed as Paranoid 
Schizophrenia with Catatonic Features. There he was restless and 
overactive. He had a marked push of speech, expressed ideas of reference 
and religious delusions and was manneristic. Said: "I figured the devil was 
trying to pull me away from God so I cut a cross on my arm. Physically I 
am the same, but mentally I am another person. ...I feel that people 
influence me by touching me - like injecting dope." Later he was 
manneristic, grimaced, was untidy, repeated practically all questions 
asked, answered briefly and usually vaguely and would say, "I don' know 
exactly," or "I don't

78

know." He remained dull, apathetic, indifferent and mute until the present 
time.

The personality factor is of undoubted importance in this group of 
individuals. After the toxic state passed off in these patients in whom the 
intoxication reaches deeply enough into the personality, a basic psy-chotic 
state developed. At times, the toxic features are in the background, the 
personality reactions being pre-dominant. What the inner relationship is 
between Cannabis and the onset of a functional psychotic state is not 
always clear. From our observation, the inner reaction to somatic 
sensation seems to be vital. Such reactions consisted of panic states 
which disappeared as soon as the stimulus (effects of the drug) faded. It 
is generally known in psychopathology that when the perception of our 
own bodily sensations is disturbed we are liable to be profoundly affected 
psychologically. Disturbances in perception of the body-model 
(Korperschema), which is built up of kinesthetic, tactile, visual and other 
stimuli, and integrated into the core of the personality, elicit some type 
of reaction. Such disturbances act as a blow to the ego, invoking defensive 
reactions of anxiety, apprehension, projection, etc., which approach or are 
schizophrenic in their clinical manifestations. The

79

following case illustrates these points:

A 20 year-old colored man admitted February 22, 1936. He is said by 
his mother to have been "nervous" for some time, said he wanted to die, 
wanted to kill himself. Prior to admission his mother caught him with a 
bottle of lysol. He had been depressed and despondent. He was a boy of 
superior intelligence as measured by the Army Alpha test. On admission he 
stated that he used Marihuana for several months and during this time he 
had heard people talking about him They said' "Oh, what an ugly boy. How 
mean-looking he is." For four months, August to October, 1935, he smoked 
three to four cigarettes a day until he began to feel ill. At first Marihuana 
made him happy. Then he felt that he made a peculiar noise in his throat; 
ate once a day; was unable to sleep; and experienced auditory 
hallucinations. The hallucinations started four months ago and increased 
gradually. He thought his face was changing. He looked thin, mean, and 
ugly; he became self-conscious. He felt that every-one in the neighborhood 
knew it. He stated at times he seemed speeded up, but his mind was keenly 
alert with the development of the ideas of reference, he became self-
reproachful, apprehensive and fearful.

He was then transferred to a state hospital on March

80

13, 1936, where he stated his hallucinations had disappeared and his 
emotional reaction improved. After three months he was discharged to his 
home; within five months he was readmitted to Bellevue Hospital, where 
he had gone in a state of panic, and from where he was re-committed to a 
state hospital. He was tense, uneasy, still retained ideas of reference, 
acted oddly at home apparently in response to his delusions. Diagnosis on 
second admission to State Hospital was Dementia Praecox Paranoid Type, 
which was made about two years after the onset of the original illness.

Some cases showed the manic-depressive reactions, but these were 
in the minority. It is perhaps to be expected that schizophrenic-like 
psychoses are more common because individuals who take to drugs have 
some deep inadequacy to start with. The cyclothymic personality is less 
prone to require the drug.

A man of 28 who was brought to the hospital by his mother on 
February 13, 1938, with the history that he had been smoking reefers for 
some time. A year ago he had an episode, was not hospitalized and 
improved from it. On admission patient was confused, restless, apprehen-
sive. He engaged in violent daydreamings. At times he appeared to be 
reacting to hallucinations. He said he

81

"had a big head." He became talkative, euphoric, elated and overactive 
after a day or so. He said: "The best thing for me to do is. . . you look fine. 
I've got to look like you . I know what it is . . . when a Buick and a Packard 
get together." His speech was distinctly flighty, his behavior panicky; was 
constantly restless. Would cry, sing, talk.

He was transferred to a state hospital on February 24, 1938. There 
his condition persisted and he became somewhat depressed, but showed 
promise of recovery a few months after admission. Diagnosis at State 
Hospital was Manic Depressive Psychosis, Manic Type.

Mixed reactions merge with the toxic psychoses. These reactions 
vary clinically, some occurring in chronic alcoholics, some in 
schizophrenics and some in psychopathic personalities, and in all of them 
Marihuana usage was a factor. It can be clearly seen that aside from the 
direct toxic effect of the drug, the personality of the patient plays a 
tremendous role in psychotic states following Marihuana usage.

A Cuban, age 34, who was admitted on March 6, 1938, to Bellevue 
Hospital. He had been taking Marihuana for one and a half years. He had 
jumped in front of a south-bound subway train without injury. He was very 
depressed, dull, lackadaisical, despondent in attitude.

82

He was definitely under productive but still strongly suicidal. He 
described taking one cigarette every day of Marihuana for a year and a half 
because it took his worries away. For some time he had been conscious 
that people were looking at him He feels that his body is heavy all the 
time. Sometimes he hears deceased persons talking to him. He sees lights 
at times. At times he sees a photograph of a strange person.

His friend corroborated the history, stating that he had been in this 
depressed condition for 3-4 years. He had a work-house sentence for 2-3 
months for Marihuana. He was transferred to a state hospital March 18, 
1938. At that time he was dull, preoccupied, but lost his hallucinatory and 
delusional trends. The State Hospital diagnosed him as Schizophrenia, 
Hebephrenic Type (?) and he was released after two months.

In some cases the drug makes relatively little difference in the 
content of the psychosis. It is for the clinician to determine how much 
Marihuana influences the clinical picture. In South Africa, where dagga 
(equivalent of Marihuana) smoking is very widespread, a diagnosis of 
Marihuana psychosis is made in any "toxic psychosis where there are very 
good grounds for assuming addiction to dagga smoking." It is felt that 
there should

83

be more exact criteria, as we outlined above, for a diagnosis of 
Marihuana psychosis, by which we mean the presence of disordered 
sensorium, characteristic colored visual hallucinations, time changes, 
subjective and somatic feelings. One is apt to over-estimate the place of 
Marihuana in the causation of a psychotic picture.

A white man of 28, admitted January 23, 1938, to Bellevue Hospital 
with a history that he was in a state hospital in Arizona for 3 months 
about two years ago and one in Indiana for 9 months four years ago. "I was 
smoking this Marihuana weed (at time of admission to State Hospital in 
Arizona). I ran around the desert for a time, ran out nights and one day 
knocked on a door and told a woman I was Dillinger. I tried to see how 
much water I could walk in. I was just like hypnotized and walking in my 
sleep. Sometimes I feel like something's controlling me. Sometimes I feel 
just like I'm talking to somebody with my mouth closed. I just ask them a 
question with my brain and they answer. Sometimes it's a man, sometimes 
it's a woman's voice; it just works in my temple. I think it's imagination. 
It's just like a dream. People stare at me. Sometimes I see different 
colors. I had that years ago - just like a light coming towards me; it's not 
a light, it's an arc.

84

His effect was flat and he was dejected and slow-speaking. Showed 
blocking and evasiveness on. sex experiences. Had ideas of reference and 
persecutory ideas.

He was transferred to a state hospital, where he was noted as being 
preoccupied, under productive and somewhat dissociated. He stated that he 
had some sort of seizures that were not really fits, but that when he had 
them if he had a sword he would not mind cutting everybody's head off. He 
also believed if anybody got killed near the place where he worked he 
would be blamed for it. Said that when he looks in bright lights he sees 
visions like all sorts of different colors, blues, whites, and these seem to 
blind him. A diagnosis was made of Dementia Praecox, Paranoid Type, and 
he was still in State Hospital after five months.

In psychopathic personalities, those with deep inferiorities, use of 
drugs is a method of supporting the ego. In these cases Marihuana does not 
always produce the desirable effect. Apparently it is not strong enough to 
affect the problems which have involved deeper layers of the personality. 
Such individuals adopt heroin or morphine very soon after a short 
experience with Marihuana. The experience of drug addicts seen at the 
Court of General Sessions confirms this. Persons addicted to

85

heroin, morphine, cocaine or opium never return to Cannabis. Such 
individuals are admittedly psychopathic in that they need an increment of 
drug to make their lives tolerable, In the next case, the use of Cannabis 
represented the attempt of the patient to overcome his sexual inadequacy. 
In this respect the social psychology of the drug is a factor, since 
Marihuana is popularly supposed to free sexual inhibitions.

A white man, age 23, admitted to Bellevue Hospital on March 31, 
1938, with a history that he felt unworthy and thought he had a venereal 
disease. He held ideas of infidelity against his wife and was assaultive. 
Threw a four month old baby across a room. He turned gas jets on. On 
admission he was rambling, talkative, evasive, depressed, self-absorbed 
and had somatic complaints.

He said: 'I was sentenced to the Workhouse for 4 months for smoking 
Marihuana. I knew then I was not satisfying my wife and I thought it might 
help. A year ago some friends gave me the weed, I smoked several. I felt 
calm and liked to listen to music - very happy - exhilarating feeling - 
that's all."

In the hospital he was talkative, discussed his problem in detail and 
showed some depression, which improved. The infidelity ideas and his 
sexual inadequacies concerned him most. He was transferred to a state 
hospital with a

86

diagnosis of Psychosis with Psychopathic Personality; Cannabis usage a 
factor.

Often Cannabis intoxication represents a stage in the incipiency of a 
psychosis. The patient who is developing a functional psychosis strives in 
the incipient stage to overcome the unconsciously perceived difficulties. 
In this sense Marihuana usage represents a healthy reaction tendency, even 
though the mechanism may be unknown to the patient. The next case 
illustrated this problem. A boy who had made a successful adjustment on a 
moderate level of social attainment began to show schizoid behavior 
shortly after the usage of Marihuana. The process continued to a psychotic 
state. What role did the drug play? Could the psychosis have begun without 
the drug? Was the use of Cannabis the patient's attempt to cure his 
developing psychosis? These are problems needing careful judgment and 
study and wide clinical experience.

A young Negro, 20, admitted October 2, 1936 to Bellevue Hospital 
with a history of having been dull, indifferent for some time. Insisted 
upon keeping the windows closed, would not leave the house, but denied he 
heard voices. Would masturbate openly and made sign with fingers, and 
actions were decidedly peculiar. Mother states she caught him. smoking a 
sweet-smelling

87

cigarette with a white man and soon after got a history from his 
playmates that he had been smoking Marihuana cigarettes for a long time.

Observation in the hospital confirmed his withdrawn, retarded 
attitude. Psychometric gave an IQ. of 75 with rating of Borderline to Dull 
Normal Intelligence. Was pre-occupied on ward; difficult to obtain his 
attention; evasive; offered many excuses for closing window and putting 
out lights. About 10 days after admission he appeared a little more alert 
and cheerful. He was discharged in custody of mother as Incipient 
Schizophrenia (?) or Psychoneurosis, Reactive State, on October 13, 1936.

He was readmitted a year later, October 15, 1937. At that time 
mother gave a statement that for past year, since he left hospital, he had 
been dull, staying in the house in a "deep study." He seems to listen; does 
not say anything'. At one time he beat up an old man in the house who, he 
said, called him names. Prior to admission he had attacked a woman for no 
apparent reason. Sleeps day and night. Often looks as if he is in a dream, 
Changed personality reactions for more than a year. For two weeks 
distinctly worse.

On admission he was sluggish, dull and lethargic, spoke in a quiet, 
low voice, showed empty affect, but was

88

intact in intellectual functions, memory, comprehension, orientation. He 
was transferred to the State Hospital on October 20, 1937, where he was 
evasive and dull. He showed no interest in the surroundings and did not 
mingle with the other patients. He expressed mild ideas of persecution and 
of electricity, was evasive and suspicious. He said some people called him 
bad names across the street. Believes that an attempt was made to harm 
him. "I sometimes have a funny feeling in my legs (electricity)." Their 
diagnostic impression included the possibility of Dementias-Praecox, 
Paranoid Type.

Gradually he acquired an interest and socialized with other patients. 
At all times he was neat and tidy in personal appearance and habits. He 
improved after five months and was ready for parole.

Now, so much for the psychopathic. We now come to the criminology.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I thought we would cover that in another 
subject.

We will now adjourn for lunch and come back at 1:30.

(Thereupon at 12:20 oclock p.m., a recess was declared, the 
conference to resume discussions at 1:30 p.m.)

89

AFTERNOON SESSION.

The conference was resumed at 1:30 o'clock p.m., pursuant to the 
taking of a recess at noon.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Gentlemen, the Conference will be in 
order. We may very well start with the general discussion on the 
pharmacological phases of the problem, and you can direct your questions 
to Dr. Munch, Dr. Loewe, or Dr. Bromberg.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, I would like to ask you, in respect to the 
statement made by Dr. Walton that Cannabis has been used as a relief 
during labor in the Far East, are you familiar with that general picture?

DR. MUNCH: Yes. I think that the product that is actually used there is 
not Cannabis itself, but one of these peculiar mixtures of datura and 
opium and hashish and other things.

Some of the reports refer to the women smoking the cigarettes for a 
period in labor, but they are not in agreement with the information I have 
gotten from the Mexicans or out in Nevada, for example, where they have 
tried it and found it of no value.

On the isolated tissues the solutions of the drug have no effect, or 
have a very mild, quieting action.

If I remove the alcohol, they have little effect,

90

which means that the active principle is not sufficiently soluble in water 
to produce an action. So that I do not believe the action is very definitely 
therapeutic. It is more psychological, I believe, than it is physiological.

MR. WOLLNER: Who is Willis? One of them refers to the fact that 
Willis recommends its use in tedious labor where the patient is restless.

DR. MUNCH: Let me look at my copy of this book. 

MR. WOLLNER: It is on page 156.

DR. MUNCH: Did you say "Willis", Mr. Wollner?

MR. WOLLNER: Yes. On page 156, "EFFECTS DURING LABOR". It starts 
out, "Willis recommended".

DR. MUNCH: Willis has written a book on obstetrics and gynecology, 
but I cannot give you the reference to it right now.

MR. WOLLNER: All right.

DR. MUNCH: But he is one of the authors in that field. However, the 
work I was referring to more particularly was done by Watt (?) and 
Breyer-Brandwijh, which [sic] I believe is the co-author of the publication 
on poisonous plants in South Africa.
I have had correspondence with Watt along that line.

91

He refers to it in the last paragraph there after South Africa.

MR. WOLLNER: The reason I ask you that question is because of Dr. 
Bromberg's remarks, which I interpreted as being indicative of the 
production of a hypersensitivity. Am I wrong in that, Dr. Bromberg? 

DR. BROMBERG: A hypersensitivity?

MR. WOLLNER: On the part of an individual who uses Marihuana; that 
is, an increased agility.

DR. BROMBERG: The effects I refer to are on a motor activity. You 
refer to those, I presume? 

MR. WOLLNER: Yes.

DR. BROMBERG: By which we mean the promptness to move either 
aimlessly or purposefully; that is, in acute intoxication the smoker is apt 
to dance around and move or wave his arms, or go through movements that 
are more rapid than he would move ordinarily; move his chair, knock it 
across the room, talk to people, show a general output of activity.

Many of those prisoners whom I have contacted state that they 
rather slow up or would rather be quiet during this period. There are two 
effects, in other words.

The hyperactivity is not universal. The great, ex-

92

treme activity results in assault, throwing people around. This is similar 
to what you see in certain types of alcohol intoxication, so-called 
pathological intoxication, where a few drinks set a man off into a 
rampage, breaking things, throwing things around, and fighting.
I think maybe men come in on that more than women because of the 
basic physiological pattern. They are more active anyhow. This refers to 
women, does it not? 

MR. WOLLNER: Yes, sir.

DR. BROMBERG: Certainly the effects are not uniform and cannot be 
counterbalanced.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, regarding these 31 admissions 
out of 100,000, I think it would be interesting to know just what period 
they cover. Are they of recent origin, or are they scattered pretty well 
throughout the years?
The reason that I bring that up is that the mental hospital at Burma 
showed, with the increased illicit traffic in Marihuana, the total 
admissions of insanity cases rose from .87 to 4.35%. I am wondering 
whether we can expect an increase in such cases, and also whether these 
31 cases are more or less of recent origin.

93

DR. BROMBERG: I can answer that by saying that the admissions 
already in the past four years of this type of Marihuana insanity is almost 
twice that which it was during the first four years of our observation, 
that is, three years of our observation period.
Of course, you can realize that many other cases go to private 
hospitals which pass off without regulatory medical treatment, and there 
are other factors so great that I would not put much reliance on these 
figures. I merely give them to you as true data so far as we have available.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have been getting some reports from 
various sections of the country showing cases of alleged insanity due to 
Marihuana which have been brought to light.
For instance, there were interesting developments in a case in 
Findlay, Ohio, concerning a fifteen-year-old boy who showed signs of 
being insane.
When asked about his condition he made statements that he had been 
smoking cigarettes, and an investigation developed the information that 
there were two defendants, who were brothers, who were in charge of a 
playground, and they had been selling drugs that is, Marihuana cigarettes, 
to boys around there; and we found about sixteen pounds concealed above a 
garage owned by them. These fellows had

94

stopped selling the drug, because they noticed signs of the boys acting 
queer, and they became frightened. They were particularly alarmed 
because of what they thought was an unusual appetite for the drug.
We have a questionnaire whereby we ask Marihuana users involved in 
our cases, all sorts of questions. As a matter of fact, I would like now to 
revise that questionnaire, after what I have heard here.
One-fourth of those users when asked what effect the drug has on 
them, say, "It gives me a good appetite." "The first cigarette makes me 
feel hungry." They become hungry after they smoke, have a heavy and 
exceptionally good appetite. That is their answer without prompting. Yet 
that question does not appear in the questionnaire.
We ask them --- of course, we have to take their word for what they 
say --- whether they notice any permanent physical or mental effects, and 
they make statements which confirm the opinions of Dr. Munch and Dr. 
Bromberg. The answers are:
"I believe it has affected my nerves."
"I can not keep my mind on one thing long enough to think clearly."
"Loss of memory"; "Very bad on nerves"; "Produces twisted thoughts"; 
"Affects my brain"; "Dulls my head."

95

"Causes me to become deaf".
"I think Im more intelligent."
"Makes me tired".  "Hard to think"  "Headache and weakness".  
"Seemingly dulls senses"; and so on. 
Then the question is asked:  "What effects do you obtain from 
smoking Marihuana?" I think most of the answers confirm what has been 
said about the distortion of space, time, vision and hearing.
The auditory sensibilities are affected.
We are running into a great deal of cases which have to do with 
illicit traffic among musicians.
The next question is,  "Have you acquired tolerance?" Quite a number 
of the users have developed a craving for Marihuana.  Some of them stop 
after smoking few cigarettes, and there is no sign here that they increase 
the number that they smoke in a day.
Some of them vary between one cigarette and twenty cigarettes a 
day. Others have smoked it once; some have smoked it for ten years.

MR. WOLLNER:  I was wondering whether it would not be better, 
unless there are other specific questions, to postpone this portion of the 
Conference, which relates to bio-assay, which pertains to a chemist, 
because all of those questions are related, and go on with the rest of

96

the program.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: All right, unless there are questions.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, do you wish to say some thing?

DR. LOEWE: Among other things, I have tried Marihuana's action on a 
monkey, and I went to it with great hopes because I thought really that the 
psychic action would come out in this patient.
The observations were that the monkey reacts like the dog, and is 
one more of the few laboratory species which really show the ataxia 
action.
The other observation was that the monkey required higher doses per 
kilogram body weight than the dog, which was somewhat unexpected, and 
that all of the lower doses to which I have climbed up through the ratio of 
higher doses did not show anything which indicated a psychic action.
The monkeys do not show this type of abnormality which occurs in 
Dr. Bromberg's material.
MR. WOLLNER: What is the relation in the dosage per kilogram of 
weight of dog and human being?

DR. LOEWE: The dog dosage per kilogram of weight and the human 
being per kilogram of weight, are fairly

97

close. The higher doses used in humans are capable of showing the 
slightest ataxia symptoms, which would point to the fact that the dosage 
is almost the same.

DR. MATCHETT: This ataxia is never apparent in humans at all?

DR. LOEWE: I have no experience; I never saw it. 

DR. BROMBERG: I never saw it either.

MR. WOLLNER: Have you any observations about ataxia symptoms 
comparable to those in dogs as to humans?

DR. BROMBERG: No; but I have never seen a large enough quantity, 
certainly not the tincture or the fluid extract.

Dr. Munch can perhaps answer that.

DR. MUNCH: I have given doses up to twice that re-cognized, but I have 
not noticed ataxia in students.

DR. LOEWE: There is one factor which, of course, is important, and it 
is a fact which we notice from tobacco smoking, and that is that the 
dosage in the form of the cigarette is probably high enough to produce 
great ataxic symptoms in humans by way of the administration of inhala-
tion.

DR. HERWICK: I should like to ask Dr. Bromberg, clinically, whether 
there is a direct physiological addiction to this; that is, are withdrawal 
symptoms produced or do

98

you think it is purely a psychic addiction?

DR. BROMBERG: My idea of habituation on this matter is different, and 
there happen to be several, and we should have the thing clarified.
Habituation must rest on three cases, two of them being habit 
forming.
The first are the symptoms appearing of withdrawal of the habit 
forming drug.
The second is that the patient develops tolerance. 
The third is that because he needs more drug he gets the pleasure of 
addiction, and all medicine agrees that there must be withdrawal.
A morphine addict becomes intolerant of withdrawal. He has 
abdominal pains and various symptoms. When morphine is given he feels 
better. And that is the basis of a well known treatment.
Secondly, there are the people who take increasing doses to feel 
well. Those two are well acknowledged criteria.
In the New York County jail, the physician in charge thinks he sees 
withdrawal symptoms, but the offenders are not allowed to discuss the 
offense with anyone except counsel. They say they did smoke it, or they 
did not. You do not know whether the symptoms are tied up with the

99

drug.

So, I dare say that there are no clear withdrawal symptoms. The 
thing is not settled. Patients come in after being cut off without the drug.
The third is addiction of pleasure-loving, and in that category comes 
smoking and colorful music and things of that nature. You can say that one 
has to have pleasure after he becomes addicted to luxury, and that can be 
looked upon as a valid psychiatric observation.
So I would stop there and say that we can say that in the absence of 
other evidence, that it is essentially hedonistic addiction.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Loewe, you mentioned in your experiment on dogs 
that you had injected some of these extracts, but, nevertheless, in most of 
the experiments that had been previously done, I gather, the drug had been 
taken orally. Of course, we know the stuff is smoked.
Your introduction of injection as a method of administration raises 
the question in my mind as to whether we might, at some future date, 
anticipate the use of that on humans, in this way? Is there any possibility 
of this sort? Similar to that which obtains in heroin, for example?

DR. LOEWE: Only after the isolation in pure form

100

I would say, because, at the present time, by use. of the extracts it 
will not be an element in the whole picture to introduce it by intravenous 
injection. It has to be injected in alcohol solution, and a slight injection 
introduces a bad local infection, pain, and so on.

MR. WOLLNER: Why were you impelled to use it as an injection as a 
method of administration, rather than giving it to your dogs orally, Dr. 
Loewe?

DR. LOEWE: It goes faster. In view of the long period of latency, it is 
much more convenient to use it intravenously injected, because the peak 
of the curve is reached sooner.

MR. WOLLNER: Would you conclude from that that on dogs, for 
example, as a medium for standardization, that they are not as radically 
different when the stuff is in-jected as compared to when it is 
administered orally?

DR. LOEWE: Probably that is true, but only to an inconsiderable 
extent. In a slighter extent the variations have been reported by various 
examinators [sic] after oral administration.

MR. WOLLNER: Will you recommend it as the preferred procedure for 
bio-assay.

DR. LOEWE: I am not sure that I should give the preference to the 
intravenous way. I have to collect more

101

experiences.

DR. MATCHETT: Are the effects otherwise identical? 

DR. LOEWE: Identical.

MR. WOLLNER: The curve is more rapid; I mean you achieve the peak of 
the curve more rapidly. 

DR. LOEWE: Comparatively more rapidly. Beginning after only twenty 
minutes, and reaching the peak after half an hour or an hour.

MR. WOLLNER: Your experiments with mice were continued under the 
same circumstances?

DR. LOEWE: No. As to mice, they were injected orally only.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We can now go on to the sociological 
phases.
In 88 users there were 86 males and only 2 females. I do not know if 
that holds true generally. We might have got off the rails on the selection, 
but that is what those figures show.
There were 47 white, 20 colored, 15 Latin Americans. The age, of 
course, is much younger than among opium users. Most of the users were 
between 17 and 35. The greatest number was between 21 and 25.
I believe that was true of a survey made in New York City of the 
users.

102

MR. SMITH: We had 100 arrests there between January 1st and 
October 1st that ran: 99 Negro, 60 white, and 1 yellow; and the nativity, 
(and this nativity includes New York City and up-state New York:) 5 
Mexican, 1 Chinese, 32 Puerto Rican, 2 Greek:, some from South America, 
Cuba, Panama, and other places with 130 native born.
Then, in addition, I have 12 other cases, which to me were more 
interesting, because those persons who were held for crimes other than 
possession, and they ran such as unlawful entry, 3 for grand larceny, in 
addition to their possession; 1 for grand larceny, who admits he is a user.
Of course, the other possessor cases probably were users, but they 
are charged with possession. One with felonious assault with a pistol and 
possession; One, exposure of person; one felonious assault, both users; and 
another, felonious assault with possession; and one a wayward minor who 
admits, in addition to using Marihuana, that he is using heroin; one with 
assault and robbery, and one who was a policy peddler. They were held on 
other charges, rather than on mere possession charges.

MR. WOLLNER: What is the distribution in sexes, there, Mr. Smith? 

MR. SMITH: I have not the age nor sex distribution on those.

103

In at least four cases up-state we can show a definite connection 
with prostitution. In one we had a good report, not proven, but a good 
report that the Negro who was in possession was also running a school, 
teaching youngsters how to smoke Marihuana. Actually, we are not certain 
about the facts as to that, but that is the report that has been current 
with that individual. 

	COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Do you have anything on occupations 
of the users? 
MR. SMITH: We have four as musicians, two as farmers, and those 
two farmers were actually growing Marihuana on their farms. 
Many of them state "unemployed". But where most of those that 
report unemployed are laborers, they usually are associated with 
prostitution, policy, and some of the allied types of minor grade crimes.
 Prostitution, to me, seemed the most evident connection.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our 88, the occupation runs anywhere 
from bartender to unemployed. There are probably 50 different 
occupations, musicians are second to laborers,-of the 88.

The rest were distributed throughout the various

104

occupations.

MR. SMITH: I can give you a breakdown on that section. I have it here 
in another portion of my data.
There were 5 women arrested as sellers, and 8 women arrested for 
possession, and 147 males arrested for possession, and 7 for selling.

MR. WOLLNER: About 10 per cent. 

MR. SMITH: Yes, sir.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In our geographical distribution, we show 
the larger number of these around New York; a few in the New England 
areas; a few in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, several in the Middle 
Atlantic States, about 5 in the South, Kentucky and Tennessee, four; 
Michigan-Ohio, 13, Michigan-Ohio is second to New York.
And then they string out through the rest of the States, with 
California probably third.

MR. SMITH: In States with equal population ratios, as to the 
metropolitan district, as against up-state New York, our arrests for 
Marihuana violations in the State, excluding New York City, are about 10 
per cent; 15 cases, actually, against 160.
They probably will vary, though, as to the development of 
prosecution and apprehension, as in the various up-state cities they are 
just beginning to realize in the

105

last year that Marihuana is a problem, and the figures for 1938 will be 
higher than 1937. I expect 1939 will again be higher in up-state New York, 
so that that ratio of about 10 percent should rise.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Bromberg, you were about to start on 
the sociological phases. Will you give us the benefit of your views on 
that?

DR. BROMBERG: The material that I have collected comes from the 
Court of General Sessions. This is the criminal court of New York City.
Our material is limited to New York County, although it must be 
remembered that the courts clientele comes from many sections of the 
country.
We must also note that there are many racial types in our material. 
This is important, because the British investigators have noted in India 
that Cannabis does not bring out the motor excitement or hysterical 
symptoms among Anglo-Saxon users that occurs among natives. There are 
several other difficulties in selecting reliable material, one being the 
dependence on statements from prisoners without opportunity for 
objective tests or other corroborative checks, as in the case of other 
drugs, e.g., heroin or morphine.
During the routine interviews of some 17,000 offend-

106

ers during six and a half years, we have come across several hundred who 
have had direct experience with Cannabis. Their testimony checks with 
experimental results and clinical experiences in regard to 
symptomatology of intoxication, the absence of true addiction, and the 
negative connection with major crime. Especially is this noteworthy 
among sexual offenders, and in cases of assault or murder.
The extravagant claims of defense attorneys and the press, that 
crime is caused by Marihuana addiction, demand careful scrutiny.
The cases analyzed in this study cover a period of more than six 
years, from 1932 to 1938. Out of over 16,000 prisoners in this six-year 
period, 200 offenders were convicted of drug charges or found to be users 
of drugs, although convicted of other charges, in the Court of General 
Sessions.
Cases of possession for sale are handled in the Court of General 
Sessions which has jurisdiction over felonies. There is no distinction 
made in the indictment in the Court of General Sessions as to the nature 
of the drug sold.

Of this group of 200 drug offenders, 67 were indicated to be users of 
Marihuana in any degree and for any duration of time whether convicted of 
the crime of selling Marihuana or another crime.

107

The remaining 133 offenders were morphine or heroin users.
It is important to note that the only measure of Marihuana usage is 
the statement of the offender. Since statements of use are conceived by 
them to be prejudicial to their interests in court, we meet evasion and 
denial fairly consistently.
Our most reliable source of information is from those not arrested 
for traffic in drugs and questioned in the routine course of psychiatric 
study.
Now, this leaves out thousands of smokers who were never arrested, 
people who were never arrested, and people that we deal with who were 
arrested for major crimes, including the one of selling drugs. Those people 
were all questioned about Marihuana.
Those who were arrested for selling drugs, specifically Marihuana, 
were questioned as to the use of it. Some of those admitted using it, and 
some did not.
All the criminological material that we have has to be taken with a 
very large dose of salt, and they are either convicted by the time we see 
them, or about to be, and are still frightened, and want to keep their fair 
records clean.
The only useful record which we have in which we can

108

throw out and include material as it sounds reasonable to us, and it is 
checked, so far as the use of the sociological aspects of it, and the effect 
of it, and so forth, so that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 
87 cases of Marihuana users consisted of 21 whites (native born and 
European extraction), 23 Negroes, 20 Puerto Ricans (some of whom are 
considered to be racial mixtures), 2 Mexicans, and one Negro and Indian 
mixture.
Of the 67 studied, 46 were convicted of possession and sale of 
drugs, and 21 other charges. Among the 21 cases convicted of crimes other 
than the possession of and sale of drugs, were eight charges of burglary, 
five of grand larceny, three of robbery, two of assault, one each of petit 
larceny, forgery, and first degree murder, and none of sexual offenses. 
Burglary, grand larceny, and robbery, then, account for 16 of the 21 cases. 
There were but two sex cases of any description in the history of the 
Marihuana cases, in both of which sodomy occurred as previous offenses. 
In three cases, the individuals were what might be called constant users 
of Marihuana. One of these had commenced to use the Marihuana three 
years previous to the current conviction; another, with a sixteen year 
record, indicated Marihuana, had been used for fifteen years; the third 
referred to his use of Marihuana as

109

"several years duration. None of the offenders reported any lasting 
effects from Marihuana. Interrogations as to the habit-forming nature of 
Marihuana were all answered in the negative by the prisoners.
So that in the General Sessions of Criminal Court the 67 people who 
were offenders were involved in selling Marihuana or gave some history of 
using it. Most of those people had previous charges, not including drugs, as 
to being criminals of other types. The largest proportion were not drug 
users.
The next largest number had no previous connection with the 67. 
Fifty had never been arrested for taking any drugs. This was their first 
contact with the court. These were all special cases in the Special 
Sessions Court, which deals with misdemeanors and other cases.
Here, there were 202 cases. Thirteen were there on the first charge 
of any kind, that being a Marihuana charge. Those things do not mean very 
much to me, as they simply give a certain picture, a picture of people 
being picked up and brought in for using Marihuana, and there is not a very 
heavy weighted criminal record behind them. Drug users are not Marihuana 
users in the main.
In the Court of Special Sessions in the same picture, in the same 
six-year period, of approximately 75,000 in-

110

dictments for all crimes, there were 6,000 convictions for possession and 
use of drugs. Since neither the law, the district attorney, nor the police 
department make any distinction between the several kinds of narcotics, 
their arraignments or indictments, in Special Sessions as well as General 
Sessions, there were no figures from which to estimate the number of 
Marihuana users as distinguished from the number of users of other drugs. 
We therefore adopted a system of sampling the 6,000 cases in order to 
arrive at an approximate estimation of the total number of Marihuana users 
who came into conflict with the law. In this sampling, we examined the 
records of l,500 cases, or 25 per cent of the total of 6,000. Of these, 135 
were Marihuana charges. From this, it was estimated that about 540 cases, 
or 9 per cent of all drug cases coming to Special Sessions over a period of 
six years, were users of Marihuana. 
Analyzing this sample of 135 cases, it was found that 93 had no 
previous record; 8 had a previous drug charge or charges, only; 5 had 
previous charges, including drugs; and 29 had records not including drug 
charges. Among those with longer records, that is, from four to seven 
previous arrests, none showed progression in crime from drugs to other 
crimes.

111

	In considering all the Marihuana cases in both General Sessions 
and Special Sessions Courts, a total of 202 convictions, it is an impressive 
fact that only 30 offenders had been arrested before for drug charges. This 
does not argue very strongly for Marihuana as a  drug that initiates criminal 
careers. 
Where there is a series of crimes committed by one individual, our 
records show that he passes from other forms of crime to the use of drugs. 
Thus, in only three cases out of our series of 67, in which an arrest 
associated with Marihuana was recorded, did the criminal career start with 
the use of Marihuana, and in 7 cases out of 67 criminal activity started 
with other drugs. Ninety per cent of the group is accounted for by those who 
(1) have no criminal record except as drug users, and (2) have a previous 
record from which they turned to drugs This leaves a small minority of 
offenders whose criminal careers started with drugs and went on to other 
crimes like larceny, assault, and so on. As measured by the succession of 
arrests and convictions in the General Sessions cases (our only method of 
estimation), it can be said that drugs generally do not initiate criminal 
careers. Similarly, in Special Sessions, only 8 had previous charges of 
drugs, and 3.7 per cent has previous charges of drugs and other

112

petty crimes. In the vast majority of cases in this group of 135, then, 
earlier usage did not apparently predispose these offenders to crime, even 
that of drug usage. Whether the first offender Marihuana cases go on to 
major crime can only be ascertained by referring to the findings of the 
General Sessions Courts. The expectancy of major crimes following the use 
of Cannabis, then, is small, according to our experiences
The problem of habituation of Cannabis is one of grave importance 
According to the statements of confirmed heroin or morphine addicts, 
Marihuana is not a habit-forming drug. Naturally, where it is used in 
conjunction with heroin, morphine or cocaine another problem presents 
itself.
Occasionally, an astute drug peddler will adulterate Marihuana 
cigarettes with morphine or heroin in order to retain his clientele. Care 
must be exercised in evaluating the question of Marihuana habituation, so 
that we are not dealing with this type of adulterated Cannabis.

The medical diagnosis of habituation depends on the accepted criteria 
of acquired tolerance and after-effect upon withdrawal of the drug. 
Regarding the subject of tolerance, users of Marihuana examined in the 
clinic universally state that an increase in dosage is not neces-

113

sary to achieve the desired effect as time goes on.
The increase in cigarette consumption, sometimes noted, is simply 
related to how often and how long the smoker wants to experience these 
effects.
As to the question of withdrawal symptoms, cases have never, to the 
knowledge of the writer, been observed systematically in an environment 
where control of the drug can be exercised. Although of secondary value in 
deciding the problem of habituation, it should be noticed that experience 
with experimental subjects indicates that after usage of the drug and its 
cessation no withdrawal symptoms are reported.

It has not been possible to observe satisfactorily Marihuana users 
upon their entrance into custody to establish their behavior after cessation 
of usage. For one thing, the law does not allow questioning of a defendant 
prior to trial regarding his charge. The history of the offense cannot be 
discussed except with counsel, but an offender can be questioned in the 
course of medical treatment. The fact that Marihuana cases do not request 
medical treatment upon their incarceration argues for the absence of 
withdrawal symptoms.
As is well known, morphine, opium, etc., users become violently ill 
upon being taken in custody, away from the

114

source of their drug, and are vociferous in their demands for treatment.
Nevertheless, the wide discrepancies between the reports of other 
jurisdictions and ours in the question of addiction to Cannabis demands a 
serious attempt to establish the facts in the case.
Up to March 26, 1938, Cannabis was classed as a habit-forming drug 
in Section 1751 of the Penal Code, based on Public Health Law, Article 22, 
Uniform Narcotic Drug Act. Due to difficulty in this Court in proving it to 
be a habit-forming drug (case of People vs. Williams), the Law Revision 
Commission, appointed by the New York State Legislature, was requested 
to amend the Penal Code to read "narcotic" rather than "habit-forming" 
drug.
From a legal point of view, therefore, the problem of whether it is 
habit-forming or not is not vital in this and many other States, since its 
use as a narcotic by un-authorized persons is an offense.
The writer believes it highly desirable and important that a 
Commission be appointed to examine the matter scientifically as was 
done in the case of narcosan and other reputed drug cures in 1921 at the 
Bellevue Psychopathic Hospital under Commissioner Patterson of the 
Department of Correction.

115

The most that one can say on the basis of ascertainable facts is that 
prolonged Marihuana usage constitutes a "sensual" addiction, in that the 
user wishes to experience again and again the ecstatic sensations and 
feelings which the drug produces. 
Unlike morphine addiction, which is biochemically as well as 
psychologically determined, prolonged Marihuana usage is essentially in the 
services of the hedonistic elements of the personality. 
Those are the main conclusions I have developed from that.
Then we took the cases of the Marihuana users and tried to break 
those down. It indicates that no murderers were found among this group of 
67, not one murder committed in these six or seven years by a Marihuana 
user.
There were no sex cases among these 67. We have, however, seven 
hundred odd sex cases, from first degree rape down to exhibitionism, and in 
the course of the six or seven years not one of them was a Marihuana user, 
according to history or physical examination.
At the time of our examination, two of them had sex cases in their 
history some years before. One was sodomy, and the other some other type 
of offense.
Of all of these people, only three called themselves

116

constant users.  One for three years and twelve months, and the others 
nine months.
There is one other point which I would like to mention and that is 
the case of a man named Joseph Ogden who is reported among others in Mr. 
Merrill's paper as having been an addict.
I saw him and spent some time with him. He was a psychopathic 
individual. I think he had been in the State hospital at Lexington, and had 
had several other arrests. But nothing in his history indicated Marihuana.  
In other words, the newspaper accounts must be discounted. The fact of 
the matter was that he had not even been a drug addict, but was a 
homosexualist. The offender was murdered by him and shoved into a trunk.  
I do not know whether he disarticulated his arms or not, but he sent the 
trunk to the express station, and they saw blood oozing out of it, and 
picked him up.
He told the story rather frankly. It was a horrible crime. I think 
Marihuana was innocent of that. I am sure of that, because I have been able 
to check that very carefully.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER:  We have observed two cases of sex 
crimes where we have been able to prove the connection with Marihuana.

117

A boy named Perez, in Baltimore raped a ten-year-old girl, and of 
course he blamed it on Marihuana.
It so happened that, just a year before that, Perez had been picked up 
by the Baltimore police for the sale of 2,500 grains of Cannabis, and got 
three months in jail. This sex offense happened the following year.
And there is another case down in Corpus Christi that we have been 
able to establish, where an oil worker with a good reputation, obtained and 
smoked a cigarette, after which he raped his young daughter.
Those are two cases that I know of in which we have proof.
In the case of Perez, we do not know what else might have been wrong 
with him, but he was definitely a user and a seller of Marihuana.
I believe that Mr. Smith has had a great deal of experience up through 
New York State.

MR. SMITH: We have had one case in the last two or three months, 
which has been of great interest to the Motor Vehicle Department. A 
youngster in Mount Kisco, close to New York City, was involved in an 
automobile accident in that village by hitting three parked cars during the 
evening. When he was apprehended by the police, he literally tore the 
officer's blouse from his shoulder,

118

and he had great difficulty in subduing him. 
During the evening, they first thought it was alcohol, but later the 
youngster admitted having used a "reefer". From the information we 
obtained from him, we apprehended an individual who was growing it, and I 
think we picked up about six pounds. 
We had another case farther up-state, not as well established, but 
apparently pretty well shown, of the inability of the automobile driver to 
perceive distance and speed. 
So that factor will be of considerable interest to those interested in 
traffic control. 
Because of that recent case in White Plains, we have had some inquiry 
from the State Motor Vehicle Department, and they arc considering, I 
believe, the advisability of revoking the licenses of operators who can be 
shown to be users of Marihuana, in the same fashion that we are now able 
to do after showing evidence of narcotism. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that in your State law now?

MR. SMITH: No, sir, it is not in our State law now.
In fact, I do not know if it was decided that we could get away with 
it, but through the Motor Vehicle Department we could, as one of the 
requirements in the matter of

119

ability on the questionnaire in New York up-state you have to state whether 
or not you use narcotic drugs.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Marihuana users, when arrested, want to 
fight.
Their motor impulses seem to be working It takes, sometimes, four or 
five officers to subdue a man, and they sometimes wreck the living 
quarters in doing so.
We do not have anything like that in arresting opium users.
The agents proceed very cautiously when arresting a Marihuana user.

MR. SMITH: It conflicts with alcohol which seem to be the worst cases 
yet, and we have had a few cases who used both. Those are perhaps the few 
that you have run across. Then, of course, we have those who have just been 
on the reefer alone.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER, I have noticed a tendency towards more 
gunplay among Marihuana users than among opium users.

MR. SMITH: Than among opium users?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Yes. And there has been some gun play.
The first case that we arrested under the Marihuana Act, (I happened 
to have been present in the Denver court

120

when they brought this fellow up before the judge.) had been a user for a 
number of years. He was only 23 years old, but many of his arrests were for 
assault.
I have noticed that many of these violators have a record of assault.
In Wilmington, Delaware, there was the case of John Rhodes, who 
attacked an officer with a knife and was shot and killed resisting arrest.

MR. SMITH: I have four out of twelve in one city where the charges, in 
addition to possession, are assault.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: In many cases, particularly around Ohio, 
the officers are called in cases of disturbance and they find a Marihuana 
user with some stuff on him.

DR. MUNCH: A chap I talked to told me that the use of gin came in very 
particularly with the use of a reefer. Is that true with opium? Do Marihuana 
users tend to take gin along with smoking of the reefer?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not know about that. We have not run 
into that.

DR. MUNCH: The point I am asking could be that the alcohol there would 
tend to increase the solubility of any material that has been swallowed, 
and, therefore, they would get greater effect under such conditions than if 
they. had not taken the alcohol.

121

DR. MATCHETT One of the Internal Revenue officials, formerly in 
Texas, has told us that down there persons use alcohol and Marihuana 
together, and where they were very wild it took four or five officers to 
bring a man in. He attributed that to the combined effect rather than the 
effect of either one.

MR. SMITH: Still, there is a good deal of fancy on the part of some 
officers, whose experience with Marihuana is new.
I have had some experience with one or two sheriffs. I know of one 
who recently employed the services of two other sheriffs and four deputy 
sheriffs to secure the arrest of a farmer on a farm where the material was 
growing.
Any youngster, 18 or 19 years old, could have gone there and done it 
alone. This was because of the first experience of those officers with it. I 
think the men were anxious to capitalize on the possible publicity which 
might attend the arrest. So that sometimes you run up against that problem, 
where they report that it is necessary for a number of them to subdue an 
individual. That may be an effort to make it appear a more serious type of 
crime.
So that I think we have to put our tongues in our

122

cheeks as to this, also.

DR. MATCHETT: This story came from Deputy Commissioner Berkshire, 
of the Alcohol Tax Unit.

MR. SMITH: We did have in White Plains this additional situation: The 
fact appeared there that with children of high school age with good 
financial and social background, that two of those individuals, who were in 
difficulties there, stated that the smoking of reefers had become a part of 
the initiation in certain clubs or school fraternities.

That probably is a little bit unusual, as an incident, but that has been 
definitely reported in that vicinity. 

DR. WRIGHT: Where was that?

MR. SMITH: That was in White Plains, New York.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Did you not arrest a youngster sixteen 
years old for selling?

Mr.. SMITH: Yes, sir. There were two youngsters of excellent 
background, and fine social connections. That was probably a larger factor, 
as compared to anything else, I think, and that was that they probably had 
too much financial and social backing. That may be more true in that 
particular county than in other counties in that State.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: You mentioned a case of a

123

young man using Marihuana and heroin.

MR. WITH: Yes, sir. That was in New York City. 
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: What had he used first, do you know?

MR. SMITH: I do not know. That, I extracted from the Police 
Department records last Tuesday, but I did .not have time to go back and get 
the individual cards, and I doubt very much whether the information which 
appears in the police cards will show that.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have not run into many peddlers of 
heroin who also handle Marihuana, and we have not run into many users of 
Marihuana who are also heroin users. However, as Dr. Bouquet points out, in 
Tunis there is a tendency to switch from Marihuana to heroin.
Have you run into any cases like that, Doctor? 

DR. BROMBERG: I have seen many drug addicts, who have, once or 
twice, they say, tried Marihuana, and have dropped it, because it was not 
strong enough. Most true addicts start with heroin or opium.

MR. SMITH: Do you not think that that might be more the association 
with individuals than the association with the drug?

DR. BROMBERG: Perhaps. And there is one other fact, and that is that 
alcohol and Marihuana have a more potent

124

effect than alcohol alone.
I had a case where a man started smoking Marihuana. The seller 
introduced heroin, he noticed the effect, and he became a user, but, of 
course, that was not through any choice.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: As to this question of using alcohol with 
Marihuana, I recall a case in Indiana where a man was arrested who had an 
infusion of the drug in alcohol. How do they do that? Drink it and smoke a 
cigarette?

DR. BROMBERG: No. I think it is a sociological matter. He uses the gin 
with it, or otherwise, and it depends on the amount of money and the 
locality, and they smoke, and it represents having some fun, the effect 
which they look for.

MR. WOLLNER: I wonder how much can be deduced from the present 
figures in the matter of crime, in view of the fact that these figures 
represent a static picture whereas the entire Marihuana picture, so far as I 
know, is on an up-curve.
Have you noticed any tendencies that are not static over a period of 
years Dr. Bromberg?

DR. BROMBERG: That is a very good question, because the alcohol thing 
depends on the relationship between the two.

125

But I have been in contact with the court for about five years, and the 
number of Marihuana peddlers has not increased, but the number of 
Marihuana users we do not know about.

MR. WOLLNER: In what order, would you say?

DR. BROMBERG: It is impossible to say. These are only approximations, 
I admit. It all depends on the police activities.
They make a drive, and the figures go up. They forget about it, and 
there are no figures.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are there any questions as to this phase of 
the problem?
I must say that we are still sort of groping as to a lot of those 
questions.

DR. MUNCH: May I intrude there, just as a matter of difference in mind, 
as to any sort of figure representing the total number of users of 
Marihuana? I mean, has anybody said anything as to the number of heroine 
users being the same as the opium addicts, or less or more, or as to the 
Marihuana?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: It is impossible to say. The eradication of 
16,000 acres of Marihuana during the past year means nothing as to 
numbers of users. We are sure it was never meant for the illicit traffic. 
Probably

126

15,000 of the 16,000 acres was wild growth.

DR. BROMBERG: You mean additional acreage than that which had 
humans on it?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have arrested over 1,000. The Bureau of 
Prisons is a little concerned about that, because it is causing a definite 
increase in their jails.
Puerto Rico is starting to send a lot of these sellers and users to jail, 
which they did not do before. There has been a tremendous up-grade in 
apprehensions.
I do not recall just what the arrests have been by states throughout 
the country. These are Federal arrests. State arrests are probably over that 
figure.
I should say that the 16,000 acres represent only a drop in the bucket, 
because I know in one State there are 300,000 acres of the wild growth. We 
have a job here on eradication that is just stupendous.
Fortunately, a lot of this acreage that is discovered we hear about 
through people who do not tell anybody else about it.
The illicit trafficker is looking for growth. I cannot understand why 
the New York trafficker had to go out to Minnesota and strip some of those 
hemp fields.

MR. SMITH: We had two instances where the material was either 
reported to be, or actually was, of western

127

growth, and they were getting a higher price than was paid apparently for 
New York grown. Whether that was bona fide, as to the material from New 
York State, or as to the material from Minnesota, I do not know, or whether 
it was a question of price boosting as to the New York sales prices, we still 
do not know.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I think within a couple of blocks from 
where Dr. Munch lives you can walk into as much [as] fifty acres that has 
not been destroyed.

DR. MUNCH: They went over about 300 acres of that this year and ran 
out of C.C.C. men and then stopped.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: That is a tremendous problem with us. We 
have used many of the agencies of the Government, the W.P.A. has helped, 
and other agencies. We have discouraged all of these well-meaning people 
throughout the country who want to use Boy Scouts in the removal of' 
Marihuana.

DR. MUNCH: We have had considerable cooperation through Admiral 
Foote, and the Automobile Vehicle Department of our State.

DR. WRIGHT: May I ask Dr. Bromberg whether or not his contacts with 
these patients show whether or not there is any indication of whether 
these cigarettes used were tobacco which had been adulterated with 
Marihuana?

128

DR. BROMBERG: My source of information is the Police Department, and 
the cigarettes that they have gathered up are filled definitely with 
Marihuana, and no other compound.

MR. SMITH: I would like to ask Dr. Bromberg, or anybody else who has 
had experience as to the likelihood of development of perversion.
Has anybody had any experience on that?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Dr. Kolb, have you run into anything on 
that? 

DR. KOLB: No, sir. 

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: How many of these users have you in 
Lexington?

DR. KOLB: There are about one hundred patients who have used it 
occasionally, but they are mostly opium and heroin users. 
About twenty-five have used nothing but Marihuana alone. 
But, just as Dr. Bromberg has stated they use it occasionally, just to 
see if it is another drug that they need.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Are these Marihuana users, as such, a 
younger group than your opium smokers?

DR. KOLB: Most of the time.

129

For instance, we had a man from Puerto Rico, about fifty years old, 
who had been a judge, and who said it was a political plot that he should 
get four years. I do not know how politics came into it.
He said, "Well, they are trying to get rid of me."
He never had any criminal record. That seemed to be a rather strong 
sentence for users.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We have noticed the tendency in Puerto 
Rico, even with heroin users, to give them five years for use only.

DR. KOLB: Yes, they give them a very severe sentence.
The district attorney wrote me and wanted to take it up with judge 
Cooper. I told him that, from the stand-point of rehabilitation, it was a 
rather harmful matter to put a man in prison for four years. He is liable to 
learn a lot of things in prison and then go out and hate society and use them 
against society.
It is my idea that users should get one year, and especially the fellow 
who does not have a criminal record.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: I do not think the courts here are being too 
severe.

DR. KOLB' No, they are not.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: They are giving the seller

130

a great deal more than the user, on the average. 

DR. KOLB: Of course.

MR. WOLLNER: What does your investigation represent as to these 
twenty-five users of Marihuana alone, as compared to those who use other 
drugs other than Marihuana?

DR. KOLB: Of course, we get them after they have stopped using the 
drug, and after they have escaped the acute effects of the drugs, There is 
only one psychiatric case, which we are not quite sure of, that has been due 
to using the Marihuana drug.

MR. WOLLNER: I am going to ask an awfully unfair question.
What percentage of these people would have been in jail if they had 
not smoked Marihuana? 

DR. KOLB: Well, very few of them.

MR. WOLLNER: They would hot have been in jail?

DR. KOLB: That applies to a great many users of drugs.
A great many of them have done other things, particularly thievery, or 
other slippery types of work. 

MR. WOLLNER: Are they slightly impaired?

DR. KOLB: They are slightly impaired, partly due to the psychiatric 
condition, and to the distress of needing the drug.

131

There are very few violent types of crime with the opium addict.
Our experience with the Marihuana addicts is not enough to give an 
answer. I rather think that with the alcoholic-Marihuana user, that he 
would become a type of drug addict that would cause many crimes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER:  There was a case in Canada, Mr. Lancaster, 
there a Marihuana user had withdrawal symptoms similar to those of an 
opium user.

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, sir. That was the boy who was picked up and had 
used Marihuana for a long time. He was out of work, had no continual 
employment.
He tried to smoke Marihuana, rather liked it, and after several months 
of usage, he was jailed, and kept there for about a week.
His case was remanded, and he reported feeling tingling pains and 
needles in the hands and feet, and he was greatly upset and pleaded for a 
narcotic again. He was suffering with an imparity of that order. I do not 
think it was tried to see whether giving him Marihuana should relieve that 
case or not.
The general impression is that there is no great suffering, and if they 
are relieved from it after the first five days, naturally they want it again, 
but they do

132

not break down if they do not get it.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Bromberg, have you come across any occasion of 
drinking Marihuana in the form of tea extract, or something of that sort? 

DR. BROMBERG: No.

MR. SMITH: Is there any evidence of it being used in Canada? On any 
convictions, have you had any evidence of it ?

MR. LANCASTER: Not there, no. No, sir, so far there have been no 
samples submitted to us as yet.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: None that I know of.
But I understand they do mix them, mix it with sweets, in northern 
Africa.

MR. SMITH: There have been one or two reports that they do mix it in 
California.

MR. WOLLNER: For your ears, I can tell you, Mr. Smith, that all of the 
chemists are sitting on the edge of their seats, worrying about that 
happening

MR. SMITH: And there is a question as to the toxic effects which could 
be present.

MR. WOLLNER: And there may not be any way in which we can examine 
it. We are hoping that they do not guess that gasoline will extract it.

DR. MATCHETT: Is it true that that is a common form

133

in the Far East?

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: No, not in The Far East, but in the Near 
East. 

DR. MATCHETT: In the Near East, yes.
 
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: We seem to have covered the  sociological 
phases, so far as we are able to and I am going to turn the choir over, at 
this point, to Dr. Wollner, who will proceed with the chemical phases. 
This is where most of the spade work has got to be done, anyway.

STATEMENT OF MR.. H. J. WOLLNER, 
CONSULTING CHEMIST, TREASURY DEPARTMENT

MR. WOLLNER: The problem is not yet resolved. We are not yet in a 
position to know exactly what it is we are looking for, and, within four 
walls, I am perfectly frank to admit that al]. the chemists I have met, who 
are interested in this field, are at a complete loss when asked to prophesy 
the character of the narcotic principle, which we are going to eventually 
disclose.
The situation is as bad in the chemical literature as it is in all of the 
other phrases.
I should certainly be within the reasonable bounds of correctness 
when I say that ninety percent of the stuff that has been written on the 
chemical end of Can-

134

nabis is absolutely wrong, and, of the other ten percent, at least two-thirds 
of it is of no consequence.
That ninety per cent has had, however, to be dealt with, and chemists 
all over the world have been interested in Cannabis, and in the past few 
years have spent a goodly portion of their time upsetting a lot of this 
shibboleth and tradition which has been set up, probably a thousand years, 
so as to clear the ground and to be able to proceed in a more orderly 
fashion.

In this work the evidence, by force of circumstance, compels us to 
turn to the pharmacologist for guidance.

As Dr. Loewe ably expressed before, since we have no test in the 
chemical laboratories for indicating the presence or absence of the 
narcotic principle, every bit of the exploratory work of consequence that 
has been engaged upon had to be paralleled with work in the field of bio-
assay.

The chemical problem is so obvious that it does not require much 
delineation.

Chemists, enforcement administrative chemists, are interested in 
two things. First, and immediately, they want to know how to find and 
detect the presence of Cannabis sativa, or any of its products that are 
narcotic in character.

In other words, most enforcement officers will make

135

a seizure in some form, solid or liquid, and the question asked is, "Is this 
Marihuana?" And no satisfactory technique for answering such a question 
obtains today.
That does not say that in most of the cases that come before the 
chemists they are not in a definite position to make a definite statement, 
that before them the substance is definitely Cannabis sativa, but they can 
not do it as definitely as in the case of morphine, opium, and heroin.
The second question they would like answered is,
"What is the narcotic principle, or what are the narcotic principles 
present?"
That question is not one of enforcement so much as of general 
administration.
The Commissioner of Narcotics has the problem of deciding, at times, 
what regulations shall be invoked in respect to an industry or an 
agricultural phase of this problem.
The question arises, how long shall we have to wait before the resin 
is decomposed, during the rotting process, for example, and the only way I 
would know how to answer that question is to know how long that principle 
will exist during that rotting exhibition. Of course, we do not know. We can 
not answer that question.
The question arises, can recommendations be made to


136

exempt the use of certain portions of the plant and certain industrial 
directions, as far as governmental regulation is concerned, be given by 
virtue of the fact that they are harmless. No statement can he made on that 
score.
So, it becomes important, from an administrative point of view, for 
administrative chemists, associated with the carrying out of the Marihuana 
Act, to have a more competent picture of the drug, as competent as obtains 
at the present time in respect to the poppy and its secretion, opium, and its 
products, morphine, heroin, codeine, and so on.
This drug, peculiarly enough, has withstood competent attack for an 
extensive period of time.
Before the laws were passed controlling the opium picture, chemists 
were able to supply a fairly excellent background, against which such 
legislation and regulations might have been and were in fact predicated.
But, in the case of Marihuana, there is no such background. It is just a 
fog; without question the psychiatrists and bioassayists and agricultural 
people know far more about Cannabis than do the chemists.
So far as knowing anything about the plant, today, is concerned, all 
they can tell you is that such and such

137

a product is not a narcotic, such and such a product is non-narcotic, and 
they are trying to shrink the residue further and further, but they have not 
touched it.
Of great assistance in clarifying the issue has been the work 
undertaken by Dr. Blatt, in reviewing the literature.
Dr. Blatt has prepared a paper consisting of a critical review of the 
literature on narcotics, published in the journal of the Washington Academy 
of Sciences on the 15th of November. I have a number of copies of the paper 
here, and also a chart setting forth the general character of the critique, so 
that a person who is a technical man can get a picture of the thing.
I am going to ask that only these people who have a working 
knowledge of chemical symbology receive them, and we will try to get 
enough copies to mail them out to you later.
I am going to ask Dr. Blatt if he will be so kind as to offer a picture of 
his survey as to the chemical constituents of Cannabis Sativa.

STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. BLATT, 
HOWARD UNIVERSITY.

DR. BLATT: That will not take very long, because as Mr. Wollner has 
said, we are only dealing with two-

138

thirds of ten percent of the material. 
Very briefly, the story is, you can take Cannabis and extract it with 
one of several solvents, or combinations of solvents and obtain a 
physiologically active extract. The only successful technique that has been 
applied to that so far has been a distillation process, and through the 
distillation you can get out of it three substances, which I will simply 
name and pass on. 
One of them is a paraffin hydrocarbon known as nonacosane, that is, 
physiologically, inactive. 
If you do a distillation, you get a definite distillate, and all chemists 
who have worked with Cannabis know it as red oil. Unfortunately, it also 
was known as Cannabinol, and that has been the cause of much trouble. 
	This red oil looks a good bit like a lubricating oil of a rather poor 
quality, a semi-solid material at room temperature. 
That material we will simply call narcotic-active by a physiological 
test. The real nasty principle about the situation is that that material 
behaves as if it were a chemical substance, and there have been three 
different formulas proposed for it. 
One of the formulas has Cot so far as two individuals having agreed 
upon it. Then the hitch comes. In about

139

forty years, three English workers succeeded in preparing and isolating one 
pure chemical substance from this red oil.
They called that Cannabinol, and the one individual substance derived 
from it is also called Cannabinol. For thirty years, nobody following them 
was ever able to get this pure Cannabinol.
So, we went ahead and worked with Cannabinol, and assumed that we 
were working with the pure substance
Then, roughly about eight years ago, the pure chemical individual, pure 
Cannabinol, again was secured for the second time, and apparently it can be 
repeated.
Pure Cannabinol is the fourth chemical substance to be gotten out of 
Cannabis, and it is the fourth one to be lacking in narcotic activity. It is 
toxic, however, and it is quite possible that some of the .activity of Canna-
binol, some of this complex activity that has been referred to during the 
morning, is due to pure Cannabinol as a chemical individual.
The chemical structure of pure Cannabinol has been fairly well 
worked out. It is not definitely settled. We do not need to go into that
 There is one more thing that should be pointed out, and that is the 
fact that for thirty years perfectly com-

140

petent chemists have taken this red oil, distilled, and worked with it as if 
a pure chemical. It not only gives analytical values of resin, but they are 
even more complex. You can carry out the chemical reactions with this.
So, let us refer to red oil as the crude Cannabinol; and the chemical 
individual as pure Cannabinol. You can run chemical reactions. You can 
reduce an acetylate and the products you get out are still analyzable for the 
proper derivatives of crude Cannabinol. That is, where everybody has gone 
haywire.
There is one ray of hope, and a pretty definite one, as to the confusion 
of a mixture which was taken to be a definite chemical substance, and that 
is why progress has been so slow, and that is the fact that we have no way 
quantitatively of following the definite reaction of the chemical principle..
The one ray of hope I mention is the fact that you can take red oil, 
crude Cannabinol, remove one-fourth, which is inactive as pure Cannabinol, 
and the residual three-fourths still retains chemical activity. There is 
where the work begins. That is as far as has been gotten chemically.
There is just one more point here. As far as I have been able to find, 
and I received corroboration at noon, there not only is no correlation, or no 
correlation has

141

been made, so far as I can find. out, between the various color reactions for 
Cannabis and the narcotic activity, and I was told at noon that, not only had 
there been none made, but it was because there definitely is none. So we 
can not fail to follow the activity as to this color test.
I may be getting off in deep water, but that is the apparent final 
analysis. There is one more thing, and that will finish it up.
I hope not many people will be misled by the principle that the active 
principle of Cannabis is Cannabinol. You will find it even there. The active 
fraction which you will find, which is more or less of a mixture, is called 
Cannabinol.
You can find a chemical substance which is not active. I think that 
covers it.

MR. WOLLNER: I think that adds oils to the fire. 

DR. MUNCH: Is there an active substance there? 

MR. WOLLNER: I will take your word for it, and Bromberg's on the basis 
of his research in New York
It leads us pretty much to where we started.
I think if all the research work done so far were dumped together by a 
group of chemists, or if they started out today on this investigation, that 
they would be exactly the same as they are now inside of six months;

142

	that is, all of the information which we have, which is very 
little, could be accumulated in six months. 
Recognizing that situation, the Treasury two years ago undertook to 
lay the basis for a competent attack on the problem. 
We did not know what that would consist of, but we knew sound, 
fundamental, reproducible information and data had to be obtained. 
The first thing we did was to contact the Department of Agriculture, 
and with their cooperation, there was planted a plot at Arlington Farms 
over here, last summer, and the summer before, where the plant was 
observed in its various stages of growth, and which furnished us all of the 
criteria the literature offered us in the past. 
As I mentioned earlier, about ninety percent of all of it was thrown 
out. The report of the first year's investigation was published in the journal 
of the American Pharmaceutical Association. I have a number of copies 
here, if there are any technical men who have not soon that report. 
An equivalent report is being prepared at the present time on the 
basis of this summers work.
We have obtained several tons of Marihuana. We have extracted or are 
extracting huge quantities of that mater-

143

ial, in an effort to provide a satisfactory amount on the basis of which a 
broad attack on the problem may be predicated.
Dr. Matchett is in charge of the Treasury's own immediate attack on 
the problem, and I believe he has some information which he can lay before 
you this afternoon. 
Is that correct, Dr. Matchett? 

STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN R. MATCHETT, 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 

DR. MATCHETT: The problem is clarified a little bit by recognizing 
that there are two distinct phases involved, the first of which must be 
pretty well finished before the second can begin. 
First of all, there is the separation of the active principle from other 
material, and second, the characterization of it. 
Before a competent separation can be undertaken, we must be in 
possession of suitable assay methods. 
We, of course, are interested in those manifestations of Marihuana 
that lead to the effects, which have led in turn, to the passage of the Act
We are not sure, I take it, whether the substance produces ataxia in 
the dog, or sleep in the mouse, or corneal(?) anesthesia in the rabbit is the 
same as the one in which we are interested.

144

Nevertheless, something must be adopted, and by common consent, a 
dog assay, with all its faults, has been the method of choice.
It seems obvious that these various principles, if more than one 
exists, will be each characterized on its own merits.
In considering this phase of it, also, it must not be forgotten that any 
one of the effects may be combinations, and any of the effects that we are 
able to measure may possibly be combined effects, of which the bad effect 
of the drug itself may be only one. 
With that so disposed of, it is possible to recognize that certain 
characteristics of the so-called resin are fairly well defined already, 
although I think we must recognize that the resin itself is variable, and to 
what extent, we are not yet able to say very definitely.
As Dr. Blatt said, there have been certain individuals isolated in pure 
form, of which the most important are Cannabinol and the hydrocarbon 
nonacosame.
There is also present definitely in the resin a substance that responds 
to the alkaline Beam test.
There are still other substances among all those responsible for the 
psychological and physiological activity; of such there may be one or more.

145

And finally, there are those volatile oils, in which there is no 
tremendous interest other than to dispose of them before being able to 
isolate the drug.
Now, little or nothing is known of the nature of the active substance. 
All attacks on the problem have, thus far, broadly speaking, produced 
negative results. The thing, in any event, is not an alkaloid, because we are 
not able to extract it into acid solutions from solvents, nor does it contain 
any nitrogen. It is not an acid, since it does not extract into alkaline 
solution. And it has not been shown to contain any carbonyl groups because 
it does not form any derivatives with the common reagents for such.

There is evidence on the other hand that it forms esters and that it is 
an aromatic substance, the latter from the refractive index of the most 
active fraction. From that it would appear to be a phenolic compound. The 
substance is thermostable under rather rigorous conditions, but it is 
quickly destroyed in the presence of oxygen.
It is also quite likely that it is unsaturated since reduction by 
hydrogen is possible.
But all those, unfortunately, are properties of the active mixtures 
that Dr. Blatt referred to, rather than of any chemical individual. They are 
all of some assis-

146

tance though, in considering methods by which the problem may be 
attacked.
Now, only distillation in a rather high vacuum has been of any 
assistance thus far in fractionating the mixture, known as Cannabis resin. 
The volatile oils are so separated with relative ease. The substance 
responsible for the acid Beam test, whatever it may be, is removed, the 
acid test no longer appearing in the distillate.
The hydrocarbon which does appear in the distillate can be removed by 
crystallization from alcohol or some other solvent, and pure Cannabinol can 
be removed as a crystalline acetate or paranitry benzoate.
As Dr. Blatt pointed out, this point is where the trail ends at present, 
with the exception of a brief note indicating that it is definitely possible 
to find physiological effects in the material remaining after Cannabinol has 
been removed.
It is at that point that we purpose ultimately to actually begin.
The former distillation has been carried out at pressures anywhere 
from atmospheric down to a reported pressure of about five-one 
thousandths of a millimeter.
From the character of the work in which this was reported it would 
appear that the reported pressures must

147

be taken with a grain of salt. No essential difference however has appeared 
in the products of fractionation. The material, as you may be aware, is an 
exceedingly difficult material to work with, a heavy tar-like oil, and it 
does not lend itself readily to distillation by any means.
We have considered that at this point it might be preferable to resort 
to molecular distillation in an effort to obtain a more competent 
separation. If this hope be realized, a number of avenues of attack are 
opened or re-opened. That is, among other things the action of solvents may 
be reinvestigated, and of particular interest will be the action of solvents 
at low temperatures.
Then there are possibilities of preferential adsorption, and also it 
may be possible to prepare crystalline derivatives. They fail to appear from 
treatment of the present mixtures.
Now, the molecular distillation outfit that we have chosen for this 
work is of the static type, rather than the cyclic still with which you are 
probably more familiar, because the higher boiling fractions of this 
material are so viscous that they probably would not cycle with in that 
still without special precautions to maintain a high temperature.

148

The original material has been distilled before passing it into the 
molecular still in a flash apparatus that operates under a good vacuum. This 
is necessary since the crude oil is particularly prone to spit in the 
molecular still and ruin the distillation.
More specifically, the process that we are following is extraction 
from the plant material with cold alcohol, alcohol being chosen as a solvent 
rather than petroleum ether, on account of fire hazard. This process is 
followed by a liquid extraction from the alcohol by pentane, which does 
away with a lot of water soluble material, and tarry material of a 
nondescript character.
We have not yet thoroughly satisfied ourselves that all of the active 
material is extracted by pentane, but we believe we have every reason to 
think it is.
Then the pentane, which incidentally, extracts quite a little alcohol, 
is removed, and the alcohol is also removed.
The material is then passed through the flash process that I referred 
to a moment ago, and the distillate from here is placed in the molecular 
still. That is the point which the investigation has reached at this parti-
cular moment.
Now, it is expected to divide the oil into about ten

149

fractions in the stills, then to remove Cannabinol as the acetate and the 
hydrocarbon by precipitation from a suitable solvent, and then to 
refractions, to the remaining material.
The work from that point, of course, all depend upon the results of the 
fractionations, and can not be very definitely foreseen, other than that 
those processes, to which I referred a moment ago, will be applied.
Now, it would have been possible to have attacked certain phases of 
the problem along a number of other lines, a few of which I will suggest in 
conclusion. The first would be a characterization of those volatile oils, 
which have been referred to, and which would be of interest from a purely 
chemical point of view.
They are separated with relative ease, by steam distillation, for 
example. No one, of course, has been very much interested in them, and that 
line of attack has not been followed.
Again, someone might become interested in the substance which 
responds to the acid Beam test. It can be removed from a solution in 
petroleum either by means of alkali, and presumably would be isolated with 
relatively little difficulty, but experience shows that resins so prepared 
are not physiologically active, hence little in-

150

terest is attached to that substance.
A third possible line of attack would have been in connection with the 
Beam test itself. The development of the color is due to a product resulting 
from oxidation of some substance which is present In the resin. This 
substance is soluble in aqueous alkali, and is precipitated by acid. It can be 
readily extracted from acid solution. It, of course, is not actually the 
substance which responds to the alkaline Beam test, but it would be of 
great interest from the purely scientific point of view.

MR. WOLLNER: I would like to make a couple of announcements.
Those of you who are not particularly interested in the chemical 
attack here may find this part of the program a little arduous, and I want 
you to understand that you are at liberty to leave and interrupt if you want 
to, as I think this part of the program might be a little obtuse at certain 
points.
Dr. Blatt has just indicated that there are some errors in the material 
which he distributed on the critical review.
Do you want to indicate those?

DR. BLATT: There is one error in the literature, for example on page 
469 in the middle of the page are three

151

formulas, just one the paragraph beginning in the middle of those formulas. 
There is a carbon atom, a "C", a single line to an oxygen "0", and that should 
be a double line to make it conform to the other two.
Then, on that flow sheet, on the left-hand half of the page, the second 
of those errors reads "dihydrogenation with sulphur," and that should be 
dehydrogenation", and not "dihydrogenation".

MR. WOLLNER: As you gathered, Dr. Matchett's attack there is directed 
at the heart of the problem; that is to say, the isolation and 
characterization of the extreme number of active principles.
I indicated at the beginning that there is another phase of the 
problem, and that was identification. We at this time do not know whether 
the chemical attack is destined to determine the active principle in one 
year or sixty years.
The Treasury has issued a little manual of identification, consisting 
largely of photographs, and it is being distributed. In this country we are 
mostly dealing with the drug in its plant form, and in this manual they are 
showing the separate parts of plants, and so on, and it is helpful in that 
direction.
I am going to ask Mr. Levine to give us a picture

152

of the Beam test.





STATEMENT OF MR. LEVINE,
CHEMIST, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS.

MR. LEVINE: The Beam test seems to be the most widely used chemical 
test for the identification of Marihuana, and was first introduced by Dr. W. 
Beam, of the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratory, of Khartoum.
The alkaline test in 1911 and the acid Beam test in 1915 have come 
to be accepted as specific for Marihuana, although a lot of samples have 
failed to respond.
Workers in Europe and north Africa have used it and tried it on a large 
number of plant materials.
In general it is agreed that no other material responds 
characteristically to the test.
It has been attacked by some chemists, notably Trolle and Rende, who 
said they obtained the Beam test on a mixture of drugs consisting of ginger, 
coriander, licorice, nutmeg, and several other things.
Other workers, notably Fahamy and Keiy in Egypt, and Papavassiliou 
and Liberato, in Greece, applied the test to these materials, both 
individually and in the mixture, and failed to get a positive response to any 
of them.
As I stated before, a large number of authentic samples of Marihuana 
failed to respond to the Beam test, or

153

gave a very slightly dirty purple color, which might be mistaken for just a 
dirty color. So a number of modifications of the Beam test have been 
introduced to try to improve the results obtained in the test.
One of the steps taken to improve the test was the use of adsorbent 
charcoal to remove chlorophyll from the solution of the resin.
This was reported independently by Fahamy and Keiy, Bouquet, and by 
the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory.
One of the tests developed in the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory is 
the ethyl acetate test. Ethyl acetate is used as a solvent, because it is a 
good solvent for the resin, it has a low boiling point, hence is easily 
evaporated and it can be treated with activated charcoal, which removes 
most of the chlorophyll, and other substances, which would interfere with 
color development, but takes out very little of the material responsible for 
the Beam test.
In carrying out the test, a sample of Marihuana is extracted with a 
portion of ethyl acetate. The solvent is treated for a few seconds with 
darco or norite and filtered.
The filtrate is divided between two porcelain dishes and evaporated 
on a steam bath before a fan. To one of

154

the dishes is added several drops of the alkaline Beam reagent, and to the 
other, several drops of the acid Beam reagent.
In a large number of tests, no samples which were negative to this 
modification were found to be positive by the original Beam test, or any of 
a number of other modifications.
It seems, therefore, that this is the most satisfactory modification 
of the Beam test.
Dr. Bouquet, in Tunis, has developed two amyl alcohol tests, one of 
which uses charcoal, and the other does not.
His test consists of grinding a sample of Marihuana with potassium 
Hydroxide, and then adding a portion of alcohol, mixing thoroughly, and 
filtering, whereupon a purple color appears in the filtrate.
Then, to a portion of this filtrate he adds about a ten-fold volume of 
water, and extracts with one cc. of amyl alcohol. The purple color is 
extracted into the amyl alcohol.
In his test involving the use of charcoal, he adds a small amount of 
animal charcoal to the mixture of the alcohol, KOH, and Marihuana, 
presumably to remove chlorophyll, and then lets it stand for two hours 
before filtering.

155

The resultant filtrate is free of chlorophyll, and the tests obtained 
are better.
We have found that his test, involving the use of charcoal, works 
better with activated charcoal, such as norit or Darco than with the animal 
charcoal prescribed.
Also, we find that we get results by filtering immediately after the 
addition of charcoal, instead of letting the mixture stand for two hours. We 
have not found any case of failure to respond upon immediate filtration, 
which would respond after standing.
Another modification which we have developed in our laboratory, and 
which may be considered a modification of the Bouquet test, is probably 
most convenient of the modifications to run, because it involves the least 
manipulation. It consists merely of shaking for a few seconds the sample of 
Marihuana with a two percent alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide. 
Add to this is an amount of activated charcoal equal in weight to the 
Marihuana. The mixture is shaken for a few seconds, and filtered 
immediately. The filtrate is purple and on dilution with water, the purple 
colored substance may be extracted by amyl alcohol.
Other modifications of the technique have been proposed by Dr. 
Myttanaere, Viehoever, Placencias and others.

156

As I said before, a large number of plants fail to respond to any of 
these modifications of the Beam tests. We have followed the appearance of 
the Beam test in plants with regard to age, parts of plant, and variety.
In regard to age, some plants three inches tall have been found to 
respond to the Beam test. Some plants, at all states of growth, up to their 
decadence, respond.
Many male plants, which are all withered, and consist of nothing but a 
skeleton with a few dried flowers sticking to the top still respond to the 
alkaline Beam test.
As far as an individual plant goes, the order of response is best in the 
top, both with the male and female plants, followed by the upper leaves, 
lower leaves, upper twigs, upper stalk, lower twigs, and lower stalk. In 
other words, as you go up towards the top of the plant you get the best 
response.
Where the top responds very strongly, you generally get a weak 
response in the skin of the lower stalk. If the tops respond very weakly, the 
upper leaves will probably be negative, or just give a trace of response. We 
have never been able to get any response at all from the pith or roots of the 
plant.

157

This last summer we tested six varieties of hemp, as Dr. Robinson 
indicated this morning. Three of them were Roumanian varieties; one of 
them was Italian, one, Manchurian; and one of Chinese origin.
Of the three Roumanian varieties, about a percent could be positively 
identified by the alkaline Beam test, as Dr. Natchett pointed out this 
morning.
The other three gave a trace of response to the test.
The Italian variety was very close to this, having about 98 percent 
attainable by the Beam test.
Of the Manchurian and Chinese, only about 20 to 50 percent could be 
positively identified, and of these, practically none of the tests were as 
strong as the tests obtained from the Roumanian and Italian varieties. The 
largest number of the plants were absolutely negative, or showed merely 
faint trances of response, which we would not consider to be suitable for 
identification if the plants were unknown.
We studied the effect of heating the plants towards response to the 
alkaline Beam test. We found that heating parts of the plant at 100 degrees 
with air blowing over them for up to five hours did not have any harmful 
effects on the material response for the alkaline Beam test.
In fact, some of the plants showed better response

158

after heating than before. Although some workers in Europe say in no case 
should the extract be heated. over 50 degrees Centigrade.
However, heating the plant at 150 degrees under the same conditions 
did prove to have a deleterious effect.
Another treatment we tried was permitting the plant to mold. We 
subjected the tops of some of the plants, both negative and positive, to 
molding, in a very moist atmosphere, for a period of about five weeks. After 
this period, the whole plant was covered with slimy mold. Response to the 
alkaline Beam test was as good as it was originally.
Some negative plants which were molded remained negative after the 
molding period.
Oxidization is an essential part of the Beam test. Beam, in his 
original article, pointed out that if the tests be applied in the absence of 
air, a dirty brown color will result instead of the purple color. We have 
taken up some of the resin in alcohol, and added an equal volume of 2 per 
cent alcoholic KOH solution. The resultant solution was colorless, but on 
passing oxygen through it, the characteristic purple color developed.
Shaking the solution with charcoal had the same effect. Presumably 
this is because oxidization is effected

159

by the oxygen adsorbed on the charcoal.
Oxidation must be done in alkaline solution. Charcoal plays a dual role 
in the test. In the case of the ethyl acetate test the effect is merely to 
remove extraneous matter, since no oxidation is effected in this solution.
In certain solvents, such as petroleum ether, the activated charcoal 
will entirely remove from solution the material responsible for the Beam 
test, while animal charcoal does this to a much smaller extent. In fact, 
animal charcoal may be used in petroleum ether, although its effect as a 
cleaning agent is not very large.
The second role of charcoal is that of an oxidizing agent.
The oxygen adsorbed on activated charcoal is effective in producing 
the necessary oxidation of the material responsible for the alkaline Beam 
test. Animal charcoal is effective to a very much smaller extent, and is 
therefore unsatisfactory for use in this process.

MR. WOLLNER: I think we will have a recess now for about five 
minutes before we resume.

(A short recess was taken, after which the proceedings were 
resumed as follows:)

MR. WOLLNER: Now, after that rather exhaustive

160

treatise on the Beam test, I would like to have Mr. Benjamin tell us 
something about this so-called Duquenois test.
The reason time is being given on these tests is this: Every so often a 
new test is obtained, and this is the experience in every phase of chemical 
activity, and until several months or years have been put in on it, everyone 
gets highly enthusiastic about it.
Efforts are made to introduce it as witness material in court, and the 
first thing you know you run into a situation where you are yourself out on 
a peninsula and you can not possibly get back.
We have asked the Treasury Department not to employ any tests 
unless they are absolutely tests on a theory of so-called triangulation, so 
that when our men go to court to testify on a seizure that their evidence is 
sound.

Mr. Benjamin, will you tell us briefly about the Duquenois test and 
what our experience has been with that.

MR. BENJAMIN: I think this was proposed in the early part of 1938. 
Reagent number 1 is an alcoholic solution with vanillin and acetaldehyde.
The second reagent is concentrated hydrochloric acid;

161

The technique consists of extracting hemp with petroleum ether and 
driving off the solvent by heat.
One then takes one cc. of the alcoholic reagent, adds it to the residue, 
and into the solution thus prepared, puts two c.c.s of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid.
There is a change in color from green to slate blue to violet blue.
Now, since we have had this, we have tested approximately 165 
substances, including some of the alkaloids, the essential oils, C. D.  
alcohols, everything I could get my hands on that might show up with this 
reagent.
So far, not one sample of hemp has failed to respond to this test. 
When I say "hemp" I am referring to solid extracts, fluid extracts, and ether 
available preparations. They all show positive.
Certain essential oils when treated by the test procedure ran through 
the same changes as the hemp, namely, oil of bay, geranyl acetate, rhodinyl 
acetate, and one or two others.
There was also a compound known as Denol, that gave practically the 
same reaction as hemp. That is used in C. D. alcohols. I do not know exactly 
what it is composed of, but I think a mixture of higher alcohols and ketones.

162

MR. SCHICKTANZ: Yes, higher alcohols.

MR. BENJAMIN: I must emphasize the fact that not one sample of 
Cannabis or fluid extract of Cannabis or solid extract has failed so far.

MR. WOLLNER: Would you recommend the test as an eliminative test 
for hemp; that is to say, hemp would have to give a positive test of the 
Duquenois agent in order to be considered hemp, and then proceed?

 MR. BENJAMIN: Yes.

MR. WOLLNER: To apply another test to see whether it is another 
substance?

MR. BENJAMIN: I think the fact that ia the Duquenois test for Cannabis 
fails to respond, then one should hesitate to call the sample Cannabis.

MR. WOLLNER: That is predicated---

MR. BENJAMIN: (Interposing) On the 165. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, you have had some experience with some 
other tests, which we do not think very much of.

DR. MUNCH: That is fine. 

MR. WOLLNER: What is your experience with that test?

DR. MUNCH: I started about three or four years ago with the method 
developed by an official in the British pharmacopoeia for ergot, using 
paradimethyl amino benzal-

163

dehyde.
The results I obtained I then dropped, because I got busy on something 
else, but I have had occasion this last spring to review and finish up that 
work, which was reported at Madison and the American Pharmaceutical 
Association. The manuscript is in the hands of the editor of the American 
Pharmaceutical Association, and ought to be out next month.
In it I tried various modifications and found the 2-1/2 per cent 
solution of paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde in 65 per cent sulphuric acid, 
or in 65 per cent phosphoric acid, which is my principal reagent.
The material to be tested is shaken with 10 parts, or approximately 
10 parts, of low boiling petroleum ether, (below 40 degrees Centigrade) 
which has been redistilled and a half part of Mercks activated charcoal or 
norit, or any other U. S. P., activated carbon for five or ten minutes, then 
filtered. The filtrate is evaporated, and the reagent applied to the residue. 
The direct application of the reagent causes charring, or does not cause 
anything, according to how much material has been removed.
But on the addition of a drop of water there is an immediate 
development of a blue color, shifting toward the violet end of the spectrum, 
and disappearing within

164

two seconds or two hours, depending on how much material is present.
Ergot gives a blue color similar to that of Cannabis, but the color 
shift is toward the red. The red is much slower than with that of Cannabis, 
and it persists for several days.
I went to two neighborhood drug stores, and got ten or eleven 
materials out of their prescription department, and sent them through the 
same tests. Many of them gave no color. Others gave colors of some sort.
But, to make a long story short, none of them gave the same type of 
color as the blue shift that I obtained with Cannabis. 
I have tried about 50 samples of Cannabis, so far, and every one of 
those gave the same reaction. 
While my eye is not too good, still there is a symmetric trend 
between the potency on dogs and the degree of color developed here. By 
degree I mean intensity and duration, considering them together. But a 
product stronger on the dog has given me a stronger color. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Matchett, what is your experience with that 
Ghamrawy test? 

DR. MATCHETT: We found too many other substances, which we regard 
as giving colors too similar to that

165

given to Cannabis, to have any value in the hands [of] anyone not very 
definitely expert in the use of it. Even in such hands it is our judgment that 
colors given tobacco and certain other substances were still too near the 
color given by Cannabis for use in the case of extracts.
Of course, where we have a plant to look at, we realize a different 
situation exists.

DR. MUNCH: Even with tobacco? 

DR. MATCHETT: Tobacco was very close. 

DR. MUNCH: Is that right? 

DR. MATCHETT: This was not used with charcoal. 

DR. MUNCH: If I do not use charcoal, I get inconclusive results along 
that line. 

DR. MATCHETT: I am coming 'to that. 
It was our experience that the U.S.P. activated charcoal would remove 
either the hemp or tobacco test substance from petroleum ether. The result 
being that the test in hemp was about the same as it was in tobacco. 
I will ask Mr. Benjamin if that is a correct statement.

MR. BENJAMIN: That is correct. 

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Lancaster, have you had any experience with these 
tests in Canada?

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. [sic] Wollner.

166

Some years ago our interest was aroused as to whether or not 
Canadian Cannabis would be at all active. As some of you know, the plant 
thrives in all climates. We have it in all altitudes. There are no cultivated 
plants. 
But some years ago we wanted to satisfy ourselves about the activity 
of the Canadian produced Cannabis. Some was grown in western Canada for 
windbreak purposes, that is the only economic function it had with us. 
	After applying the alkaline Beam test, as put out from Geneva we 
obtained positive reactions, and the pharmacologists tried it on dogs and 
we found it responded, so we concluded that some of the Canadian Cannabis 
was active.
From the standpoint of the administration of the Narcotic Act, our 
interest is entirely limited to the illicit traffic, and it is confined to the 
reefer or cigarette, where we have the advantage of a physical. diagnosis, 
rather than chemical.
The chemical work on this we intend to follow up as of extreme 
importance, because it is difficult to predict to what extent the extracts 
may come into use.
There is a possibility of developing a non-reactive type of plant, but 
it is not of an immediate concern, although there again conditions of world 
trade and combined

167

complications might become such that Canada might be asked to take up 
that problem again. Who knows?
So we can not afford to lose interest in these chemical phases of the 
testing.

Our experience with the Beam test has been that it is somewhat 
erratic, and does not always give the equivalent results in the hands of 
different operators, for some reason.
Of course, there again, we have run some of our tests on plants where 
we know we have had them in storage for some years.
It is rather puzzling there is no reaction there.

MR. WOLLNER: No reaction? 

MR. LANCASTER: On prolonged storage. 

MR. WOLLNER: Under what conditions was that hemp stored? 

MR. LANCASTER: In a large glass stopped bottle. However, we have to 
check that again, because of the results of this vegetation which remained 
an open field, which is another puzzle.

MR. WOLLNER: That is where we all find ourselves at the moment.
What I would like to hear from the group is something in the way of 
suggestions as to how this problem can be

168

most competently attacked. What is to be done? The problem is not a 
simple one, although there is no indication as to its complexity. I say it is 
not a simple problem, because if material has not been advanced after 
several thousand years of experience there must be some barrier there. 
Is there any technique which should be considered which has not been 
considered?
Dr. Hibben, have you any suggestions along this line?

DR. HIBBEN: That is rather a difficult question. I think we are 
proceeding correctly.
I think the first thing that has to be done is developing an adequate 
method for determining the content of the active principle, and until such a 
method is developed, there is not going to be very much room for 
improvement.

MR. WOLLNER: The only difficulty has been that this problem has been 
very much the problem of peeling an onion--the more you peel, apparently 
the more peels you can take off, until you peel away the onion and then 
there is nothing left.

DR. HIBBEN: That is quite true. But I do not think there has been any 
comprehensive, systematic work done on the problem, by an adequate 
chemical staff, under ade-

169

quate direction.

MR. WOLLNER: The first thing seems to be to find the active principle. 
That is a different proposition.

DR. MUNCH: Has any work been done on the chlorophyl of the leaf?

DR. MATCHETT: All the work we know of is what you have done.

DR. MUNCH: The only thought I have is, if the chlorophyll of Marihuana 
happens to be different from all other chlorophylls in the universe, it can 
be identified microscopically.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Hibben, you have run some microscopic tests on 
Cannabis direct for the chlorophyll. 

DR. HIBBEN: I did not look for chlorophyll. I say that is very desirable, 
but I say they would be very doubtful on the chlorophyll alone.

DR. MATCHETT: Of course, there are some points about that. 

MR. VALAER: The chemistry of opium was very uncertain for a long, 
long time. We had a crude mass to work with, and gradually they pulled out 
one hundred pieces or more. I believe, after all, we have not been interested 
in this more than about two years. I believe the chemical crude resin 
Marihuana will work out in the same way. We have two stills upstairs. We 
have a good many people

170

working on it in extracts and various ways, even now in this brief time.

MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Couch, do you have anything to offer?

DR. COUCH: I would like to say that this problem is in no more 
desperate condition than a great many other problems in which a solution 
has not been reached. They all present this picture before the real work is 
done in solving it which makes it all seem extremely baffling.
It is very curious that by plugging along and keeping infernally at it, 
that one of these days the problem is solved almost before it is realized, 
and it seems to me that the lines that have been projected here and the 
lines that have been followed are exactly those that should be followed, and 
will, in the course of time, lead to the solution of the problem; I mean the 
information that you desire to have.
There is one thing that occurs to me that has not been mentioned, and 
that is if any work has been done upon the smoke from Marihuana, as the 
smoke is physiologically active.

It may be different from the resin taken by mouth or injected into the 
veins. That is another matter. But it seems to me that there is something 
there that might

171

be developed as a test for identity.

MR. SMITH: I think Dr. Hershfield did something on that chlorophyll 
work which he did two years ago.

DR. COUCH: Of course, along that line is also the possibility of 
reaction from the protein. It simply rests on the possibility and probability 
that that is, of course, the leafy tissue, and the extract probably would not 
serve.
The leafy portion would contain some propein. That with a water 
extract or salt extract of the plant itself, in a very short time would get 
positive results, one away or the other.
The difficulty there is there may be present some protein that is also 
present in another plant. That difficulty arises, but the precipitation 
reactions are amazingly specific and amazingly direct.
When one goes from one animal tissue to another he has to wash his 
hands extremely carefully as he changes over from one to another, so as not 
to spoil the test in the next tissue. There is that sort of delicacy.
I simply offer that as a test. I presume there has already been a lot of 
thought discounted on that subject.

MR. WOLLNER: I do not know of that test. Dr. Loewe? 

DR. LOEWE: If I may bring up the encroachment which

172

is in doubt, it has been known thousands and thousands of years that sex 
cells contain an active principle. However, it has taken up to this century to 
get hold of those active principles, and the reason was not the difficulty 
with respect to chemistry, but the difficulty was that there was no test 
for the active principle only as an active principle, and no chemical tests 
were given.
This is the same situation in Cannabis with one exception, and we 
know the physiological test for the active principle is given. It is much 
more easily accessible. This biological test is much more easily accessible, 
so there is a test, and the thing which has not yet been done, at least not 
yet systematically enough, is to dovetail the identification of the active 
principle by its active nature by a biological test.
I think this specific picture of the dovetail work gives immediately 
the solution, unless somebody is inclined to drop the whole thing.
But I again remember that same situation in the female hormone and 
the male hormone, which involves just this one property to give a beautiful 
color reaction. However, it did not take more than five years after finding 
the right test and using the right test in the right way from the first 
isolation of the principle. I think

173

this is the way prescribed.

MR. WOLLNER: Do you know of any experiments, Dr. Loewe, that have 
been performed on the smoke itself? 

DR. LOEWE: No.

DR. BLATT: I know of where they took the Marihuana smoke and passed 
it through solvents.

DR. LOEWE: Through chloroform? 

DR. BLATT: No, through water. 

DR. LOEWE Water, rather than chloroform?

DR. BLATT: Yes.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There is a great deal of work being done at 
the present time with respect to the use of opium smoke. A paper has just 
been prepared by someone in a laboratory in London, which has just been 
issued. Are you familiar with Dr. Nicholls?

MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. Nicholls was mentioned in connection with 
the research today.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that the same Nicholls who is on the 
Opium Assay Committee?

DR. BLATT: I was going to say very much the same thing as Dr. Loewe 
said; that is, that I can not see any reason for being discouraged as far as 
chemistry is concerned.
Now, you have got a perfectly good point of attack.

174

The amazing thing about this whole problem is that nothing has been 
done with the exception of this one matter in 1932, when it was 
established that crude Cannabinol behaves like a pure substance, and the 
customary high vacuum distillation technique fails to separate it into its 
constituents. 
The work has been apparently dropped from that time on.
The surprising thing is that someone has not jumped into that.

MR. WOLLNER: Of course, there has been no commercial demand in that 
respect, .and that is one of the reasons for that.

DR. BLATT: It is difficult to get hold of the material. 

DR. HIBBEN: If you want to get something on spectroscopic methods, 
when these chemists leave the point where there are spectroscopic 
methods for determination and for determining the structure, they would 
aid greatly in facilitating this problem.

MR. WOLLNER: It would aid greatly.

DR. MATCHETT: We would like to ask Dr. Hlbben if there are not some 
such methods which may be correlated to the bioassay?

175

The essential or volatile oils come out of this material very readily. 
It can be narrowed down to relatively few compounds.
If we knew, separately, the spectra of these various materials, would 
it not help to follow the separations at that stage of operations?

DR. HIBBEN: Yes, I think it would. You can start in by that procedure on 
hormones.

DR. MATCHETT: And I believe also carotenoids. 

DR. HIBBEN: Yes.

DR. MATCHETT: As the fractionation goes further and further, the 
number of bioassays increases almost without limit, and that is one reason 
we were particularly interested in it.
Also, the quantitative phase has to be considered. 

DR. LOEWE: But, as an economic matter, and the rational method is to 
proceed in an economical way, which can be done by carefully choosing 
fractions to test.

DR. MATCHETT: I do not believe we could quarrel about that.

DR. MUNCH: Doctor, there is the other thought, and that is that we have 
not been picking on any of the prisoners lately.

COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, we are not dealing

176

with the same problem as opium, where we can take the addict to a hospital 
at Lexington and go through all of the experiments.
There is a little danger that this drug might affect a man 
permanently. He might do something which we may be sorry for later.
I think that must be given serious thought.

DR. WRIGHT: Dr. Wollner, I will not be very long now, but I just want 
to clarify a point, and it would seem from reports and other information 
that the tests are rather indicative of hemp rather than of the active prin-
ciple.

I am saying that for this reason: We would like to be in a position to 
approach the development of strains that were free from the active 
principle,
Now, until we have a test it seems to be that we can not do anything.

MR. WOLLNER: Yes, and no.

DR. WRIGHT: I will say it is possible that one of these tests may be 
useful from a breeding standpoint, but it seems to me it is working entirely 
on a guess,
It would seem to me that any approach would be resolving the strains 
in pure breeding alone. In other words, approach the inbreeding situation in 
a hybrid manner;

177

that is the approach we want, but it would seem to me that all we could do 
at this state would be to develop those lines at random.

In other words, set up as many facilities as we could for pure 
breeding lines. Any individual plant that would be tested would be very 
indefinite as to what its progeny would be, and it would seem to me that 
that is more or less a blind approach; shall I say a lick in the dark; and we 
would have to develop as many as we could. We can do that, develop as many 
lines as possible, like in Prussic acid in Sudan grass.
My point is, and I am mentioning it to you chemists, that we can get 
nowhere without a test of consequence. We might be lucky. About ten 
thousand chances to one, we might be lucky until we have a test.

MR. WOLLNER: In the last analysis, you are unquestionably correct 
about that. Really, before significant progress can be made by the 
agricultural people, we will have to provide you with a formula.
Before we adjourn, I would like to invite any of the visiting friends 
present to come upstairs for a few minutes and see our laboratory set-up 
for tackling this job, the molecular stills, and extraction equipment, and I 
am quite sure you will enjoy it.

178

And I want to really express my appreciation and thanks for your kind 
cooperation in helping to clarify these issues.

(Whereupon, at 5:10 o'clock p.m., the Conference was adjourned sine 
die.)
