<STRONG><H1><I>Ants are everywhere!</I></H1></STRONG>
What do I have to do to keep them from moving into my home?
and what about getting them out of my garden? my roses?
I want to do it without using chemicals that can harm me and my
environment!
These questions and more will be answered in these pages of  <IMG SRC = goldstar.gif ></A> Dances with Ants.
I have been doing Natural Pest Control since 1972 and I have developed a very simple yet
safe way of controlling your ants.

I encourage your questions and I will answer them for you.
Because my time is limited, I can only answer IGA members'  questions.
However I have developed an FAQ section , so non-members
can send in their questions which I will post (in that dept) with an answer for all to see and use.
<P>     If the information available here is not enough, you have a few choices;
1... You can buy the ant chapter for just $2.  This is the latest version from my book
"Natural Pest Control".  In it you will find more help on ant control.<BR>
please GOTO  <A HREF = th01005.htm>Chapter Order Form</A>   for  info<BR>
<P>2... You can join IGA, see  <A HREF = th01002.htm>About The Invisible Gardeners of America / Joining</A>
see  also  ,  if you want the book, or <A HREF = th01004.htm>Natural Pest Control Book Info</A>
you can buy the book at your local store or look elsewhere for organic ant control
help... (if you find it , let me know and I will provide a link to it).
I hope you like what I am doing enough to lend your support by joining IGA (since 1972)
with your one time fee of $55! Good deal, huh?

     If  you  are interested in issues of sustainability and  concerned
     about  the  health and well-being of the Earth   and   all  living
     things,   a  gardener or farmer, researcher or policy  maker   you
     will want to read -

    <STRONG><H3> Remineralize the Earth Magazine</H3></STRONG>


     Published  by  Remineralize  the  Earth  International,    For   a
     Sustainable Agriculture, Forestry  and  Climate, incorporated   as
     a   non-profit corporation,  and currently seeking 501(c)3  status
     as an  educational tax exempt organization.

     E-mail: reminearth@aol.com or check email box below.


     Currently    research  is  being  conducted  by   theUSDA/ARS   in
     Beltsville,  MD  and the National Aggregate and Stone Associations
     have  a National Task  Force  on Remineralization. The U.S. Bureau
     of  Mines  reports there are millions of tons of  gravel  and rock
     dustas  a by-product of the sand and  gravel  and stone industries
     that are appropriate for remineralization all  over the country.

     Regenerating  our  soils, forests and health  and  the  climate  .
     Recycling  minerals  with  finely ground  gravel  and  rock  dust.
     Remineralize   the  Earth  has a rock dust  primer,  international
     gravel and  rock  dust source list, letters and forum, network and
     resource list.  You'll find out what's happening around the  world
     for   gardens and   farms,    forests  and  orchards, health   and
     nutrition    and stabilizing  the climate. You'll learn about  the
     cooperative  efforts  of  others,  businesses and  eco-sustainable
     projects  from  small  to large scale.

     Remineralize  the  Earth is a reflection, forum,  round  table  of
     ideas,  experiences   and  research   of  those  concerned    with
     networking  and implementing  soil remineralization.

     Each  issue  has  48-56  pages  of practical   how-to-remineralize
     articles,   the  latest research  and experiences from around  the
     world.   We   reach  an  emerging  global grass  roots   community
     network.

    <STRONG><H3> Restoring Ecological Balance</H3></STRONG>


     Remineralization  is regarded by a growing movement  worldwide  as
     a  blueprint  for the survival of the Earth, restoring  ecological
     balance  and, perhaps, even recreating Eden. The  remineralization
     of  forests,  farms, orchards  and  gardens with  glacial   gravel
     and   rock  dust  is nature's  way  to  regenerate  and  fertilize
     soils.

        During   an  Ice  Age, as glaciers grind rock to a  fine   dust
     over millennia,  a  fertile soil is created. Adding finely  ground
     gravel  dust to soils is a tremendous boost to organic agriculture
     and  can make it truly viable by adding up to  a  hundred elements
     and  trace  minerals  needed by all life and  by  nourishing   the
     microorganisms  in the soil, whose protoplasm is  the   basis   of
     all  living   things.  It is an alternative  to  harmful  chemical
     fertilizers and pesticides for a truly sustainable agriculture.

     <STRONG><H3>Remineralization and the Climate</H3></STRONG>


     There   is  evidence  to suggest that as forests  begin   to   die
     off  worldwide,   giving off carbon dioxide, the climate  of   the
     Earth   is  altered,  triggering  the  transition  from  the  warm
     interglacial   to   an Ice  Age. (See Newsweek  11/23/92)  We  are
     hastening  this  process   with  the  burning  of  fossil   fuels.
     Undertaking  the task of remineralization is urgent   to   restore
     our  agricultural  soils,  to  save the dying   forests   in   the
     temperate latitudes and stabilize our climate.


     <STRONG><H2>A BRIEF PERSPECTIVE</H2></STRONG>


     As   Ward   Chesworth  and  co-researchers write  in  Agricultural
     Alchemy:

     <STRONG><H3>Stones into Bread</H3></STRONG>


     "Our most optimistic expectations are no less than the realization
     of   an   old   dream:  What  will  fertilizing  with  stone  dust
     accomplish?   It  will   turn  stones into  bread...  make  barren
     regions (fruitful)  (and) feed the hungry."  Julius Hensel

    <STRONG><H3> Bread From Stones  (1894) Soil Remineralization -</H3></STRONG>

     <STRONG><H3> A Natural Fertilizer</H3></STRONG>


     The  soils of the entire world have become severely  demineralized
     by  erosion  over thousands of years. Plants require a  continuous
     intake of minerals, just as we do, and for very similar reasons  -
     calcium  to  build  structural support, iron to carry oxygen,  and
     so   on.  Plants growing on mineraldepleted soil do not get enough
     nourishment and  so become smaller, less-abundant and less  hardy,
     more  vulnerable to  the insects,  worms and fungi  that prey upon
     them.    Remineralization   causes  a   phenomenal    growth    of
     the  microorganisms   in   the  soil. It increases  the   nutrient
     intake  of plants.

     It   counters   the   effects of soil   acidity,   prevents   soil
     erosion  (just  for  that reason it would be worth  applying  rock
     dust), increases  the  storage  capacity of the  soil, contributes
     to   the  building  of precious humus complexes,  has  anti-fungal
     properties, and when you spray it on plants it repels  insects  as
     well.  The plants and trees become  highly  resistant to  insects,
     disease, frosts,  and  drought.

     Remineralization  also  enhances  and  speeds  up   the    process
     of  composting,  so  if  you  are composting  for   your   garden,
     consider putting on some rock dust.

     <STRONG><H3>For Agriculture</H3></STRONG>


     The  best  source of soil minerals is simple crushed gravel dust.

     In  1976   John Hamaker  spread gravel crusher screenings on  part
     of    his ten acres  in  Michigan. The following year, in an  area
     of  sparse rainfall  and dry summers, and with no irrigation,  his
     corn produced 65  bushels per acre, compared to yields of under 25
     from  other local farms. Moreover,  when independent analyses were
     done,  Hamaker's  corn  was found  to  contain 28% more   protein,
     47% more calcium,   57%  more phosphorous,  60% more magnesium and
     90%  more   potassium    than  the same type of  corn  grown  with
     chemical fertilizers nearby.  Don  Weaver grew 18-foot pole  beans
     on remineralized soil  (Jack  and the  Beanstalk?)  and got two to
     four  times the normal  organically grown yield.

     Alan   LePage  of Vermont grew a crop of carrots averaging   1-1/2
     feet  long. And  there  was  no insect damage to any   of    these
     crops.  Hamaker  estimates  that  on  fully  remineralized   soil,
     American agriculture could grow four times  as much food as it  is
     capable   of now  - or the same amount of food at about one-fourth
     the cost -  and with no pesticides
     or chemical fertilizers.

     <STRONG><H3>For Forests</H3></STRONG>


     The  results of long term experiments released in 1986 showed that
     in  a  forest  where pine seedlings were remineralized,  after  24
     years the wood volume was four times higher  than in the untreated
     area.  Recent remineralization  trials of a dying forest  on   Mt.
     Mitchell   by  Dr.  Robert Bruck, Ph.D.,  showed  12  weeks  after
     application  of  rock  dust, height  growth  of   red  spruce  was
     increased by 27% over  non-treated controls,  and height growth of
     Fraser fir was 19% greater  than  the untreated controls.
     (Forestry Research packet p. 9)

     The    Men    of    the  Trees  organization  in   Australia    is
     doing  remineralization  trials with  many  species  of  trees  in
     Australia  with phenomenal  results, such as five times the growth
     of  tree   seedlings  of  one  variety  of  eucalyptus,  over  the
     untreated controls. (See Forestry Research packet p.17)

     <STRONG><H3>The Nutritional Aspect</H3></STRONG>


     When   we   eat   food grown on depleted soil we  too,  like   the
     plants,   lose  our  natural  resistance  to  disease.   All   the
     degenerative  diseases  have  been  on the  rise  in  America   in
     recent  decades.   Dietary   fat, cholesterol,  salt  and  overly-
     refined   foods  seem  to  be  major   factors,  but   a   serious
     deficiency of minerals in our food may  be  another.

     Mineral   depletion  of  soils  has  been  found  to  be  directly
     correlated  with death rates. And deficiencies of only  one  of  a
     number  of   trace minerals  -  copper, iron,  selenium,  etc.   -
     have  been  found  in laboratory  studies   to  be associated with
     an   increased   risk  of cancer.  You  may   want  to  grow  more
     complete, nourishing  food  for yourself and your family.

    <STRONG><H3> A Global Perspective On Climate</H3></STRONG>


     The    problem   of  soil  demineralization  also  has  a   global
     perspective.   It   is  known  that  the  Earth's   soil   becomes
     demineralized  during  each interglacial  period,  the  relatively
     short 10,000-year  warm  period between each 90,000-year major Ice
     Age.   Consequent  decline and death of the  world's  forests  and
     other  vegetation which occurs causes great quantities  of  carbon
     dioxide  to  be  given off. The level of  carbon dioxide   in  the
     Earth's  atmosphere has been rising exponentially   for  the  past
     century.  Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse  gases  trap  excess
     heat from the sun, potentially affecting the world's climate.

     It   is  also well-known that when the glaciers advance  and  then
     recede  during each recurrent  Ice Age, they grind down  rocks  in
     their  path,  and this mineral-rich  dust  is blown far  and  wide
     over   the   surface   of  the Earth,  remineralizing   soils  and
     causing plant life to thrive again.

     John   Hamaker  has supplied one missing piece of a cosmic  puzzle
     to provide  an explanation,  long sought, of the  awesome  100,000-
     year cycle of major Ice Ages.

     Hamaker points out that the greenhouse effect occurs primarily  in
     the  tropics, which get  the most  sun, rather  than in the  polar
     regions    which   get  very  little.  When  this  happens,    the
     temperature  differential   between  the  tropics  and  the  poles
     increases,   resulting  in  fierce  wind   systems,    hurricanes,
     tornadoes and storms. The moisture picked up  by  these increasing
     storm  systems also is transported to the higher latitudes,  where
     it   gets  deposited  as snow and ice, eventually    bringing   on
     glaciation and the next Ice Age.

       This has  been happening  in  recent years,  with  record   snow
     cover in the Northern Hemisphere  and  a shortening of the growing
     season,  by  weeks  in  some places, a  pattern  which   is   also
     accelerating year by year.  Hamaker  estimates  that within  a few
     decades  the  growing  season may have decreased   so   much  that
     millions of people will starve, in the richer nations as  well  as
     the   poorer.   Remineralization of the world's soils and  forests
     will  store   carbon   and  contribute to  climate  stability.  By
     assuming  the task  of  remineralizing the Earth's soils, much  as
     the   glaciers  do during an Ice Age, we can create fertile  soils
     and abundance.  We can re-create Eden.

     <STRONG><H2>A ROCK DUST PRIMER</H2></STRONG>


    <STRONG><H3> What Type of Rock Is Best?</H3></STRONG>


     Feeding  poor soil with mixed rock dust may be compared to feeding
     an  ill   person  a  varied diet of unrefined, natural food.    If
     no   one  single food is a panacea, it might follow that no single
     rock type is "ideal." Indeed, the virtue of glacial gravel is said
     to lie  in  its broad spectrum of rock types.

     Hamaker   advocates  the use of glacial   gravel   dust,   ideally
     followed   by  river and seashore gravels and mixtures  of  single
     rock  types. John Hamaker in the book The Survival of Civilization
     suggests finelyground  glacial gravel because that is nature's way
     throughout
     millennia  to  create  fertile soils.  Glacial  gravel,  which  is
     a  natural  mixture  of rocks, will create  a  broad  spectrum  of
     minerals in the  soil  in  a natural balance. Much of value can be
     gleaned   from  Europe  and  the  research and  experiences  there
     (where  single  rock types  and  combinations of single rock types
     are  used.)   Hamaker's approach, however, may very well offer  an
     even  greater potential  for an ecologically sustainable and sound
     agriculture and forestry.

    <STRONG><H3> Does It Need To Be a Special Kind of Gravel?</H3></STRONG>


     Again,   the   analogy  of  feeding soils  to  feeding  humans  is
     pertinent. From  simplistic  notions of human dietary requirements
     as  straight protein-fat-carbohydrate ratios, our understanding of
     specific    human   dietary   needs  has   grown   to   staggering
     sophistication and complexity, and we are now learning  that  what
     we don't know may exceed what we do.

       Similarly,  we  have come a long way from the simple  NPK  idea.
     But  no  amount  of controlled  research has conclusively told  us
     (or   likely will  ever tell us) precisely which minerals specific
     plants really need and  in what precise proportion.

     The   attempt to second-guess nature in all her complexity is sure
     to  be  a  futile and perpetual game of catch-up.  Hamaker asserts
     that:  "Microorganisms select what they need to make the compounds
     of   life, and  reject  to  the subsoil what is not needed,  [such
     as]   aluminum, silicon, iron, etc., which are generally in excess
     [in  gravel dust]," further pointing to "the  Kervran research  on
     biological   transmutations",  which   suggests  that   biological
     organisms   may  play  an  active  role not   only   in  selecting
     specific elements, but also in modulating their
     elemental  nature  to  create needed materials where they  are  in
     short supply.

     Hamaker  says: As long as the soil is neutral [in pH] or close  to
     it,  microorganisms will control what goes into the  plant  roots.
     These  controls are off  when the soil is acid or acidic chemicals
     are added.

     <STRONG><H3>Composting With Rock Dust</H3></STRONG>


     Combining   gravel dust with organic materials in  compost  is   a
     great  way   to   solve  application problems  and  speed  up  the
     process.   Don't  forget   a  handful of soil  to  inoculate  with
     organisms.   Gravel  dust improves  aeration  and   structure  and
     therefore  prevents  rotting. Gravel dust is assimilated even more
     quickly  in  compost than in poor soils. Compost and gravel   dust
     are    a   symbiotic   combination:   the  compost  provides    an
     excellent  medium   for  the "microorganism population  explosion"
     promoted  by  the dust,  and  the  gravel dust will not only  help
     create   more organic matter,  but  will  also  help  hold  it  in
     place,  reduce  odors  and conserve it. Add 2-20 lb. of rock  dust
     per  cubic  yard  of  compost,  if one is  doing  pile  or  window
     composting.

     <STRONG><H3>Soil Acidity</H3></STRONG>


     Soil   pH   should   be  measured  annually.  If   the   soil   is
     acidic,  agricultural  limestone may be added  together  with  the
     rock   dust   to bring  the soil pH to neutral. Gravel  dust  will
     also  neutralize  soils to  a  great degree, but  limestone  is  a
     quick remedy for agricultural soils.  Limestone is not recommended
     for  forests as it  will  destroy the humus-building complex  over
     the long term.

     <STRONG><H3>Keep Insects In Natural Balance In Your Garden</H3></STRONG>


     For  short-term rescue, very fine  dust sprayed directly on plants
     and  trees  has  been  shown  in  research  in  Germany  to  deter
     insect  infestations very effectively. Trails of rock dust  around
     the   garden  help   keep   slugs out. And  healthy  remineralized
     plants  will  not  be plagued by insect infestations in  the  long
     term.

    <STRONG><H3> How To Apply Gravel Dust</H3></STRONG>


     There   are many ways to apply dust to the soil; which method  you
     use  depends  on the scale and your preference.  It can be  spread
     by   hand out  of  a  wheelbarrow, or roto-tilled and disked   in.
     Farmer   John Sundquist applies it with a manure spreader,  bander
     or  an "E-Z  Flow" type  fertilizer applicator. He also uses  rock
     dust in a potting soil made of compost, ashes and peat moss.

     <STRONG><H3> How Much To Use</H3></STRONG>


     A  grower  of crops or a gardener needs a good response the  first
     year   after  a  fall application.  The response in any  one  year
     depends   on    the   amount   of   minerals  available   to   the
     microorganisms,   soil moisture and the amount  of  inert  organic
     matter.

          If the last two factors are satisfactory, as little as 3 tons
     of  gravel  dust  per acre worked into the top 4  inches  of  soil
     should  give good  results.  However, I prefer about 10  tons  per
     acre   worked   in  about   8 inches, since one  application  will
     eliminate the cost  of  a number of more frequent applications and
     give high yields.

     The   Application Conversion chart (shown in magazine)  will  help
     you  to   determine  how  much gravel dust to use:   3  tons   per
     acre  is considered  the  minimum  application,  10  tons/acre  is
     Hamaker's  preferred long-term application, and  20  tons/acre  is
     given as a major
     remedial  application,  for especially  dry,  poor  soil.  Smaller
     amounts are recommended if the rock dust is finer than 200 mesh.

     Sources   of rock dust as a natural fertilizer and soil  amendment
     are  available   from local sand and gravel  quarries,  and  there
     are   many products  available on the market. Costs at a sand  and
     gravel   quarry  vary    from  $1-8./ton.   Specially   formulated
     products   are   more expensive   but  often  more  effective  and
     easy   to   apply.    See Remineralize the Earth magazine for  the
     latest   information  on  sources  in  your   area   and   product
     availability.

<PRE><P ALIGN = CENTER>Organic Flea Control
<B>The War against FLEAS</B>.</P>
     Let's talk about the cycles of the flea.  There are three different
types   of  fleas,  the  Cat  Flea  (Ctenocephalides),  The  Dog   Flea
(Ctenocephalides) and The Human Flea (Pulex irritans). The Cat Flea  is
the  one we are most interested in as the other two are very rare.  Cat
Fleas  not  only  like cats, dogs, and humans but they also  like  many
other species such as rats, chickens, etc.
<H1>The Life Cycle of the Cat Flea</H1>
     Adult  fleas lay eggs outside in the grass or any warm safe  place
(usually near a warm blooded host). The eggs develop into legless larva
which  feeds  on tiny amounts of organic matter for up  to  one  month.
Usually  the eggs are laid on the hosts which then drop to the  ground.
If inside they fall on the carpet, etc. The larvae do not bite but live
off  dried blood defecated by the adult fleas. Outdoors the larva  will
lie in a shady moist spot. The larva then becomes a pupae by spinning a
cocoon and emerge in about a week as a hungry adult.
     The  cycle  for reproduction is 30 to 60 days and is triggered  by
the  presence of the host's warmth and the carbon dioxide given  off  by
the host's respiration. The Larvae can live up to 6 months and the pupae
can live to a year until the conditions are right for emergence.
     What  this  means  is  that if you have  just  moved  into  a  new
apartment  or  home  which previously had a dog or cat as a tenant  is  that  your
presence,  or your  cat's  or  dog's could trigger off their  emergence!  Many
people  have allergic reactions to flea bites while others never notice
it.  Fleas  usually do not bite humans unless there are no other  hosts
around.
<HR>
<H1>Control Methods</H1>
     Your  treatment  should be spread out over a 60 day  period.  This
means that you should do regular flea treatments every month if you are
in  areas  prone  to having fleas. I have two cats and one  dog.  I  know
fleas.  The cats clean themselves and generally don't like to  be  told
what  to do or to have anything done to them, but they can be helped  as
well as the dogs. Fleas and dogs, fleas and cats, they go together.  It's
unnatural  for  there  never to be fleas again. WE  can't  totally  rid
ourselves  of  them any more then we can totally rid ourselves  of  the
ants. The answer here is to control and reduce them. The formulas given
here  along with the hints are to help you keep fleas out of the  house
and off your animals. Follow these hints and you will succeed.
     Many  flea  collars on the market contain Sevin which attacks  the
nervous  system of the insect (as well as your pet's nervous system  and
ours  as  well). I have seen flea collars which contain  DDT!  The
companies are getting smart and are using Pyrethrium but are screwing up
when  they  add Piperonyl butoxide to boost it up. This  product  has
been  associated  with  liver disorders. You should  avoid  using  this
product.  Especially avoid using around children or  seniors  or  those
with  health problems  1. Insist on using only pure pyrethrium flowers (the
whole  plant).  Read  the ingredients. ARBICO, REAL  GOODS,  GARDENER'S
SUPPLY  are  a  few  places you can buy pure Pyrethrium  (see  resources
directory). Also available at many garden centers, etc.,

barbara, did you read the natural flea control section on my web site?
try that first.
you  can  also  buy  my  latest book Natural Pest Control  $19.95  flea
chapter.
also  you can try dusting with boric acid.Ask you local vet how to  get
it and use it.

<PRE>Because it's  a two way street we must try to understand
why ants do what they do.
<HR>
     While  ants learn quickly, people do not. So  don't  be
ashamed  that  it will take you and the ants  some  time  to
understand what you want of them and what they want of  you.
Don't use any poison at this point.  Allow the ants to feed freely
from the ant cafe.  They need to know it as the source of  food.
Watch and see if they are entering and actually taking away
the food and or water.
<HR>
    During  this time you should be using the Dr.  Bronners
Peppermint soap or some other natural soap as per chapter one
"Dances with Ants", inside the house and along any paths the
ants are using. Do not spray the ant cafes!
<HR>
     Ants  like a mixture that has a lot of water in  it  since water
is an important part of their diet, so  I make  1/2 water and
enough sugar, whether it is honey or white sugar  or whatever,
and I make sure that I add enough to thicken the water just
a little. Ants really do love honey and sugar, so give them that first!
<HR>
The results:
     The results you'll get from using the ant cafe will  be
that  almost right away you will notice less ants  indoors!
Soon  there will be only a few scouts looking around, but  the
majority of the ants wll be staying outside.
 This is just a simplied answer to get you immediate help.
There is more info available on natural ant control in the
clubs section which is available to IGA members only.
Plus there are many situations of ants that require different
solutions to solve the proble. What works for one may not work for
the other.

</table>
<p><font size=3>Filippo Grassia obtained his Degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Genoa 
in 1970. In December 1971 he joined the Institute for Naval Automation (IAN) of Italy&#146;s 
National Research Council (CNR) as a Research Scientist. In June 1988 he was promoted 
Senior Research Scientist and in April 1991 was nominated Research Manager for 
Electrotechnics, Measurement and Automatic Control after a nationwide public selection.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Since 15 October 1990 he has been Director of the Naval Automation Institute. Under his 
guidance, the Institute&#146;s research involvement in the field of marine technology has made a 
considerable leap forward, and impulse has also been given to securing national and 
international research contracts, which each year provide additional funding that doubles 
the Institute&#146;s basic budgetary allocation.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>In his early years at IAN-CNR, his research activity centred on the development of 
software for vessel operation, the study of algorithms and mathematical models for 
computer-assisted navigation and the testing of these programs on board commercial 
vessels and later on CNR&#146;s research vessels.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He has served on the organizing and/or scientific committees of numerous national and 
international congresses in the field of automatic systems for safety in maritime navigation 
and engineering of marine systems. From 1982 to 1986 he was responsible for the 
Italo-Spanish research programme managed by the Universitat Politecnica de Cataluna in 
Barcelona, which was undertaken by IAN-CNR and the Institute of Cybernetics of the 
above university. The programme focused on studies and testing of &quot;Navigation Safety in 
Congested Waters and/or Straits&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font size=3>From 1983 to 1986 he participated in the project for &quot;Shorebased Aids to Maritime 
Navigation&quot; under the European Union&#146;s COST 301 Programme and coordinated 
experimental trials carried out by an international partnership that included Italy. The aim 
was to determine the feasibility of constructing a Mediterranean-wide system for 
surveillance and assistance to maritime navigation.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He serves on numerous Italian commissions for maritime traffic and marine environment 
technology. From 1985 to 1990, he coordinated IAN&#146;s research efforts in the following 
national research projects:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>feasibility study for an oceanographic ship;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>network of open-sea meteo-oceanographic buoys;</font></li>
<li><font size=3>innovative approaches to the design and management of bases and 
systems for marine environment monitoring.</font></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><font size=3>He leads IAN&#146;s research in SNECOW (Shipping Noise Evaluation in Coastal Waters), a 
project funded by the EC MAST I Programme. (When)He was appointed Member of the 
Advisory Committee of CNR&#146;s &quot;Trasporti Due&quot; Applied Project. In December 1991 he 
was appointed by the Italian Ministry for Research to an international commission of 
experts responsible for evaluating proposals submitted to the European Union under the 
MAST II Programme.</font></p>
<p><font size=3>Since 1993 he has been on the Consultory Board of the National Institute for Naval 
Research and Architecture (INSEAN); he was also appointed by the Ministry for 
Research to the Technical Scientific Committee for the development of applied research in 
the naval field within the Ministry for the Merchant Navy. In 1994 he was nominated 
scientific counsellor for the Centre of Marine-Maritime Technology in Genoa</font></p>
<p><font size=3>He has published over 80 papers in science journals, in the proceedings of national and 
international congresses and within internal technical reports documenting external contracts 
and specific projects.&#160;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Istituto per l&#146;Automazione Navale
(IAN) has conducted research in the marine-maritime field for
over twenty years. The focus has been on increasing navigation
safety and efficiency and on developing systems for the
protection of coasts and the marine environment. The expertise
gained in field research in collaboration with experts and scientists from
related disciplines has earned IAN a significant role in major
national and international programmes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">IAN&#146;s research has undergone a natural
evolution over the years in terms of objectives and now centres
on the following areas: </font></p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="navi" </a><font size="3">SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY IN
MARITIME NAVIGATION</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">The earliest Italian studies on ship automation
and safety in navigation were conducted in the mid- to late
sixties by Genoa University&#146;s Faculty of Engineering.
Funding for this research was provided by Italy's National
Research Council (CNR), the state organization which encompasses
IAN.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The university workgroup was later joined by a
purposely-created CNR laboratory, the Laboratorio per l'Automazione
Navale, which constituted the initial core of present-day IAN and
was subsequently to gain Institute status. In collaboration with
various Italian state organizations and industrial concerns, the
two partners launched the Esquilino Project. The goal was to
install a complex control system based on a central processing
computer on board Lloyd Triestino&#146;s m/v
&#147;Esquilino&#148;, which served the route from Italy to the
Far East. This centralized system would ensure automated engine
operation and navigation tasks, the latter involving optimization
procedures designed to achieve minimum transit times and safety
on the specific leg. Sensors and instruments were employed to
increase knowledge of the naval process, and data collected
during experimental campaigns from 1969 to 1973 was exhaustively
processed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following the advent of microprocessors, the
convenience of low-cost computers offering a high degree of
integration steered IAN&#146;s application projects towards
onboard automation and microcomputers linked into a local
network, with a supervisor which also had a backup function. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The end of the 70&#146;s saw the start of
intense experimentation to explore the feasibility of using
telecommunications via INMARSAT satellites to optimize
navigation. The final goal was to increase cost-effectiveness and
safety in sea carriage while at the same time analysing the
performance of commercial operators. The program was also
intended to promote the construction of a national INMARSAT
satellite terminal in collaboration with related industrial
concerns and the Istituto Superiore Poste and Telecomunicazioni.
To pursue this goal, campaigns were conducted onboard CNR&#146;s
oceanographic vessel &quot;Bannock&quot;, which was equipped with
sensors and instruments to collect navigation, meteo-oceanographic
and propulsion data. These were initially processed by a local
network of microcomputers and then forwarded to the processor
that automated satellite terminal operation; subsequently a
programmed transmission was sent in real time to the computation
centre at IAN via a ship-to-ship connection. The first phase of
the project received scientific contribution from D.F.V.L.R.,
West Germany&#146;s Institute for Space Research, which had
entered into a long-term agreement for scientific partnership
with IAN.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although progress in ship-to-shore
communication virtually solved the problem of creating fast,
reliable links between onboard and mainland networks, the need
remained for a shore service that would be able to integrate
messages from ships with information from ports, traffic control
stations, coastguards, shipping companies and shipping agencies.
The Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) was the answer to this need.
This is a shore service designed to collect systematically all sea
traffic information available in its area by constantly checking
all vessels transiting within its range. The VTS can also relay
to ships any information that may be needed and offer advice to
help increase safety and regularity in the area's traffic
patterns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The technical-scientific know-how gained by IAN
in the maritime sector provided the ideal basis for further investigation
of VTSs and the complex issues involved. In 1983 the Commission
of the European Communities launched the COST301 Project,
&#147;Shore-based Assistance to Maritime Navigation&#148; and IAN
was assigned an important role in organizing and co-ordinating
the relevant national Workgroup, which was composed of experts
with different professional backgrounds.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In view of its background, IAN was entrusted
with co-ordination of task 8.50, which involved a series of
real-time experimental trials known as Meditrials. These were to
provide a preliminary framework for a feasibility study of a regional
VTS system covering the whole Mediterranean. The Mediterranean
trials required the establishment of a Co-ordination Centre in
the Port of Genoa (called MECC) and were made possible by
long-term partnership between four countries: France, Greece,
Italy and Spain. After four preliminary tests, the actual
Meditrials started and were completed between September and
November 1986. The trials saw the active participation of 26
ports, 8 transit stations, 5,000 vessels (33 of which offering
uninterrupted collaboration) and 16 shipowners, amounting to
13,742 information packages - equal to approximately 150,000 data
items. The trials&#146; considerable success has demonstrated the
feasibility of developing a Mediterranean-wide system of maritime
traffic services, called Regional Vessel Traffic Services. </font></p>

<h3><a name="ocea" </a><font size="3">SYSTEMS FOR MARINE
ENVIRONMENT MONITORING AND PROTECTION</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">The first research efforts in this field date
back to 1973 and were conducted both on the oceanographic vessel &#147;Bannock&#148;
(for the studies partly described above) and through
collaboration with various teams working on oceanographic vessel
instrumentation. In 1974, the National Research Council made IAN
responsible for the management of oceanographic vessel
instrumentation. A new department was set up to carry out the
activity, which on the one hand complemented oceanographic
research and on the other allowed the Institute to widen its
scope from merely providing assistance to studying and developing
new instruments. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thanks to the know-how gained in marine data
collection, IAN organized and led Italy&#146;s participation (on
m/v &#147;Bannock&#148;) in NATO&#146;s 1975 International
Campaign in the Azores-based underwater electro-acoustic polygon. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the same period, IAN was involved in
drafting the &#147;Oceanography and Seafloors&#148; Applied
Project, which centred on the following areas: databases for the
marine environment, instrument calibration, steps to increase
Italian industry&#146;s interest in oceanographic
instrumentation. Within this project, IAN investigated the
following subjects: development of modular systems for data
collection in the marine environment; acquisition and operation
of a calibration system for CTD probes (salinity, temperature,
depth); participation in the EC COST 43 research programme for an
experimental network of meteo-oceanographic buoys. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The COST 43 Programme provided a suitable
framework for a number of research projects in marine technology. Italy
participated in the construction of two ODAS (Oceanographic Data
Acquisition Systems) buoys: ODAS ITALIA 1, which started
operation in 1979 and ODAS ITALIA 2, in 1982. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">ODAS ITALIA 1 is a spar buoy built in
collaboration with various parties. The buoy was moored in the
Ligurian Sea, initially south of La Spezia at a depth of 500
metres and subsequently 38 miles off the Genoa coast on the route
to Cape Corse, at a depth of 1270 metres. ODAS IT1 collects
meteo-oceanographic and physical-chemical parameters of the
marine environment and relays them at scheduled times to a
receiver station set up at IAN. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">After playing a significant role in
coordinating the development of the buoy, IAN subsequently became
responsible for running the system and covering its running
costs. The Institute has entirely redesigned and rebuilt both the
Laboratory section (containing the supply and data collection
systems) and the sensors. These are at the centre of major
studies conducted by the Buoy Optimization Work Team, a group
which was set up and is co-ordinated by the Institute. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The ODAS1 IT Project prompted the creation of
the Open-Sea Marine Laboratory, which conducts research into several
issues: analysis of the buoy&#146;s performance in rough seas, an
indispensable notion to evaluate platform stability development
of biological sampling systems, both on the buoy itself and its
mooring instrumentation and meteo-marine parameter measurement
systems designed for long-term operation in the open sea.</font></p>

<h3><a name="marine" </a><font size="3">MARINE ROBOTICS</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">IAN&#146;s </font><a
href="/robotics/Welcome.html"><font size="3">Department of
Robotics</font></a><font size="3"> was set up in 1989 to
investigate control of complex underwater robotic systems designed
to substitute the human operator in dangerous tasks and in
hostile environments. The main aspects addressed to date have
been mission control in autonomous underwater vehicles and the
testing of results achieved in theoretical study and simulation.
One basic activity conducted in the past few years has been the
development of a family of </font><a href="/robotics/vehicle.htm"><font
size="3">Unmanned Underwater Vehicles</font></a><font size="3">,
which are intended to serve both as test-beds and experimental
field vehicles for investigation of concrete problems. </font></p>

<p>The first prototype vehicle, called <a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROBY"><font size="3">ROBY</font></a><font
size="3">, was completed in 1990. ROBY has been defined as a
&#147;Virtual AUV&#148;, i.e. an ROV that combines a particularly
high-powered console with an underwater module featuring
remarkable sensorial and operational capabilities. A second,
vastly improved prototype vehicle, called </font><a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROBY2"><font size="3">ROBY2</font></a><font
size="3">, was constructed in 1992 and tested throughout 1993. </font></p>

<p>In the same year, the department developed a dynamic AUV
simulator called ROBYSIM. The system was designed to supply
qualitative guidelines for the development of various control
strategies, the study of navigational algorithms and on-line path
planning, the simulation of sensors and the construction of a
user-friendly man-machine interface. </p>

<p>The construction of the simulator, together with the
development and testing of a semi-automatic console, were major undertakings
that led up to ROBY2&#146;s participation in the first <a
href="/robotics/scienapp.htm#ANTARCTICA"><font size="3">Antarctic
campaign</font></a><font size="3"> in underwater robotics, which
was undertaken in 1993-94 as part of the 9th Italian Expedition
to Antarctica under the PNRA Programme (Programma Nazionale di
Ricerche in Antartide). ROBY2 helped scientists collect
oceanographic data and supported the testing of SARA (Sottomarino
Autonomo Robotizzato Antartico), a robotic system designed in
partnership with ENEA, Tecnomare and other concerns. This project
was launched by the National Commission for Research in
Antarctica and is funded by the Italian University and Research
Ministry. The aim is to develop an underwater robot that can replace
researchers in &#145;impossible tasks&#146; (such as observation
of the water-ice interface in undisturbed conditions and operation
in wintertime). </font></p>

<p>In January 1993, IAN was granted funding by the European
Commission for a three-year project to be carried out by the
Robotics Department in partnership with <a
href="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk:80/subsea/"><font size="3">Heriot-Watt
University</font></a><font size="3"> in Edinburgh and DIST, a
department of Genoa University. The project is known as </font><a
href="/robotics/amadeus.htm"><font size="3">AMADEUS</font></a><font
size="3"> and comes under the MAST II Framework Programme in the
area of Marine Technology. It centres on advanced manipulation in
deep underwater systems, the main objective being to construct a
multifingered gripper with tactile and force-feedback sensing
facilities. The project is due to terminate in March 1996. The
European Commission has recently accepted a proposal for a
follow-up of AMADEUS (1996-1998). Greater emphasis will be placed
on autonomous sampling capabilities and scientific application,
and to this effect the previous consortium has been extended to
include the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine
Biology in Crete. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since March 1994, the department has conducted
a joint research study on sonar mapping and localization with the </font><a
href="http://www.cs.nps.navy.mil/research/auv/"><font size="3">Naval
Postgraduate School</font></a><font size="3"> in Monterey, Ca.
The study is based on real data collected through a
high-frequency pencil beam profiling sonar (Tritech ST-1000) and
is aimed at reconstructing a 2-D map of the operating environment in
the case of known sonar position. The study has been integrated
with a method for localizing the sonar in the case of a
well-known environment and satisfactory results have also been
reached in the operational case of partially known environments.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1994 ROBY2 was successfully deployed on
another scientific mission in collaboration with Genoa
University&#146;s Institute of Zoology. The research program,
which received funding from the Ministry of Agriculture, involved
a survey of deep-sea red coral in the Ligurian Sea. The mission
has spotlighted vehicle features and functions that will need to be
enhanced in order to improve performance for this kind of
application. Future additions will include miniature sampling
systems for sea water and bottom, as well as grasping devices for
biological and geological sampling.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A new UUV prototype, named </font><a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROMEO"><font size="3">ROMEO</font></a><font
size="3">, is currently being developed. After ROBY2&#146;s
successful mission in Antarctica, it was decided that the vehicle
should be devoted to scientific applications in pools and in the Mediterranean,
rather than being further upgraded. As the architecture adopted
for the earlier vehicles has proved highly effective, ROMEO will
maintain the same approach but will be equipped with several
innovative features designed to overcome the limitations
encountered so far. </font></p>

        This module plans the mission off-line according to user

scheduling and synchronization and consists of object modules

language that supports concurrency such as ADA. Conversely, the
Coordination Level can be based on a C++ object-oriented

<p>Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are designed to perform
useful tasks in an unstructured environment without human
supervision. Task definition must take into account possible
technical limitations, such as fuel consumption and actuator
performance.</p>

<p>Two distinct types of underwater navigation can be identified:</p>

<p><img
src="file:///E:/frontpage/clipart/Punti elenco/Labirinto bianco.gif"
width="25" height="13">long range navigation: reaching the
proximity of the target frame (position and orientation);</p>

<p><img
src="file:///E:/frontpage/clipart/Punti elenco/Labirinto bianco.gif"
width="25" height="13">fine manoeuvring: hovering over the target
with high precision even in the presence of disturbance.</p>

<p>For simplicity, our studies focus on planar motion. While fine
manoeuvring requires control of three degrees of freedom, with
long range navigation it is sufficient to control longitudinal
speed and orientation to pilot the vehicle. This may help reduce
control efforts and power consumption.</p>

<p>In fine manoeuvring the system is described using standard
cartesian equations which, combined with appropriate Lyapunov
functions, permit computation of suitable control laws.
Conversely, in long range navigation the control law is based on
a particular set of kinematic equations, which are more suited to
the purpose, and on appropriate Lyapunov functions.</p>

<p>In both cases the control laws obtained are of a closed-loop
type, so they do not require any on-line planning. However, these
control laws define an external kinematic control loop, i.e. they
compute the speed reference values to be tracked by an internal
dynamic control loop. </p>

<p>The goal is to develop an Intelligent Underwater Vehicle that
is capable of understanding its surroundings and can organize and
update its internal representation of the real world. </p>

<h4>Underwater Environment:</h4>

<dir>
    <li>positioning represents an outstanding problem: inertial
        and acoustic positioning systems cannot determine the <i>precise</i>
        position of an underwater vehicle; however, in a
        well-known environment, fine positioning (localization) can
        be computed on the basis of the vehicle's relationship
        with its surroundings. </li>
    <li>vision-based environment sensing might be unattractive
        due to murky water, poor visibility and the need for lighting.
        In these conditions, acoustic monitoring methods perform
        better but their sampling frequency is lower. For this
        reason, we have chosen a high-frequency (1.25 Mhz) pencil
        beam profiling sonar, Tritech ST-1000. <h4>Research
        topics:</h4>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#local">Localization</a>: Estimation of
        kinematic status (linear and angular position and speed) </li>
    <li><a href="#mapping">Map Reconstruction</a>: Estimation of
        the environment model (list of entities and map which
        describes their distribution in space) <hr size="3">
        <h4><img src="/icons/atwork.gif" width="38" height="38">Current
        Research:<br>
        cross-evaluation of the kinematic state of an intelligent
        system and its internal geometric representation of the
        environment.</h4>
        <p>The case under examination involves: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>stationary environment </li>
            <li>planar motion (2-D) </li>

            <li>underwater environment: relationship between
                robot and real world is measured by a pencil beam profiling
                sonar: range and bearing information. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><a name="local"></a>Localization</h4>
        <p>Assuming perfect &#147;a priori&#148; knowledge of the
        operating environment, the problem of underwater vehicle localization
        using sonar returns from known features can be addressed
        using a suitable potential function whose gradient
        provides a measure of vehicle position error. The
        estimated position is recursively updated on the basis of
        the gradient of the potential function and vehicle
        dynamics by either a simple Least Mean Squares algorithm or
        a Kalman Filter for faster convergence. A fast
        convergence estimation algorithm has been designed for
        the case of marginal speed and position errors (Sliding
        Mode Observer).</p>
        <h4><a name="mapping"></a>Map Reconstruction</h4>
        <p>Drawing on Gibson&#146;s psycophysical observations
        about perception of geometric space, Albus stated that sensor
        data mainly describe the external physical world in terms
        of surfaces. Results obtained from tests using the
        Tritech ST-1000 indicate that sonar data describe the
        external environment primarily in terms of reflecting surfaces
        and their intersections (edges) [Leonard,Moran]. This
        suggests that their projections on the motion plane
        should be considered as the basic entities of the
        environment model. Since linear approximation of reflecting
        surfaces is adopted, segments and vertices are regarded
        as being the fundamental elements for representing space
        in the proposed geometric environment model.<br>
        Each basic entity is described by a set of geometric
        parameters and its likelihood, which measures the probability
        of a basic entity existing on the basis of the sensor
        data acquired until that moment. A segment's geometric
        parameters are position, orientation, length (coordinates
        of the extremes) and their uncertainties. A segment is a
        rigid body described by its center of mass and inertia
        matrix, which specifies its orientation and position/orientation
        uncertainty. It is the line that best fits a set of sonar
        pings which belong to the same reflecting surface in the
        sense of the Least Mean Squares.<br>
        Our map reconstruction algorithm is based on the
        classical Prediction-Comparison-Updating scheme. </p>

<p>In the area of robot control, our studies have mainly centred
on learning control, dynamic control of manipulation by means of
co-operating robots or robot hands, and co-ordinated head/eye
control.</p>

<p>The problem of hybrid position/force learning control has been
addressed within the scope of constrained mechanical systems.
This approach allows simple modelling of the interaction between
robot and environment (though only in the case of stiff grasp),
and makes it possible to formulate a vast class of robotic tasks,
including co-ordinated manipulation tasks. </p>

<p>The effectiveness of the control schemes proposed has been
shown through dynamic simulation experiments, including both the
constrained motion of a single manipulator and the case of
multiple robots handling a common object.</p>

<p>Another study addresses the problem of co-ordinated control in
a robotic head/eye system. A quantitative analysis of the
sensitivity of turning images into world co-ordinates has been
carried out, achieving some preliminary results. The analysis has
subsequently been used to design suitable control schemes which
tackle the basic problem of tracking features moving in space. </p>

        project funded by the <a
        href="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm/dg12/dg12tst2.html"><strong>European
        Commission</strong></a> under the MAST II Programme. <strong>AMADEUS </strong>was

        University</strong></a> in Edinburgh, UK, and<strong> </strong><a
        href="http://www.dist.unige.it"><strong>DIST</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a
        department from Genoa University, Italy.<br>
        The focus is on improving the dexterity and sensory
        abilities of underwater manipulation systems in support
        of marine geology and benthic science. The project
        involves: the design of a hydraulic manipulator with
        three tentacle-like fingers characterized by tactile and
        force sensing ability; the development of methodologies
        for planning and control of manipulator movements; the
        development of a hw/sw architecture for implementation of the
        control schemes; the design of a<strong> </strong><a
        href="mmi/mmi.htm"><strong>Man-Machine Interface</strong></a>
        to supervise manipulation. A dextrous three-fingered
        underwater gripper featuring force and slip sensors has
        been developed. The control system is designed to allow
        automatic grasping of objects up to 150 mm diameter and 5
        kg mass in conditions of zero visibility. At the end of
        Phase I, the gripper operated as a prototype system in
        laboratory conditions and demonstrated sampling
        operations on typical objects. </td>

<p>Phase II of the AMADEUS Project was approved by the European
Commission in early 1996 and started in April '96. The
manipulator will be upgraded to permit grasping of much larger
and heavier objects and to carry out ocean trials with marine
geologists and benthic scientists. New objectives in this phase
include the co-ordinated use of a pair of UUV manipulators for
grasping and manipulation, and the incorporation and use of
additional sensory information such as optical and acoustic
vision. To pursue the project goals, the previous consortium has
been enlarged to include two new partners, the University of
Barcelona and the Institute of Marine Biology of Crete.</p>

<p>SARA (Sottomarino Autonomo Robotizzato Antartico) is a project
launched by the National Commission for Research in Antarctica
and is funded by the Ministry for Higher Education and Research.
The partnership is formed by ENEA, IAN, Tecnomare and other
concerns and IAN brings its know-how in underwater navigation. </p>

<p>The final goal is to produce an underwater vehicle that can
replace researchers in long repetitive missions and permit research
in extreme conditions; this includes tasks which are impossible
for human operators, such as non-stop observation of the marine
environment under the ice pack during winter. </p>

<p>The approach is to develop an autonomous underwater vehicle
that can perform exploration and data acquisition at preset
intervals. SARA will operate from an underwater docking station
in the proximity of the Terranova Bay Station and will return to
the station at the end of missions to download data, recharge
batteries and await instructions. </p>

<p>Roby2 was developed in 1992 and tested in 1993, both in
swimming pools and in the Mediterranean. </p>

<p>In spring 1993, Roby2 was modified in preparation for the
expedition to <a href="scienapp.htm#ANTARCTICA">Antarctica</a>,
which took place in winter 1993/94; the mechanics were adapted
and the hardware was perfected to cope with extreme environmental conditons. </p>

<p>The study of suitable control algorithms for ROBY2 has relied
heavily on the development ROBYSIM, a simple dynamic AUV
simulator. ROBYSIM can supply qualitative guidelines for the
design of various control strategies, the study of navigational
algorithms and on-line path planning, the simulation of sensors
and the construction of a user-friendly man-machine interface.
ROBYSIM features a central nucleus formed by a generic solid body
model floating in fluid and a numeric integrator which can
integrate differential equations of dynamics; it also features an operator
interface, routines for the simulation of sensors and actuators
and, finally, control, planning and sensor-filtering routines,
which can be transferred unmodified to the real vehicle. </p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="ROMEO" </a><font color="#408080"
size="5">ROMEO</font></a></h3>

<p>A new underwater prototype, named ROMEO, is currently under
construction. The new vehicle expands the approach adopted for
the architecture of the previous prototypes, which has produced
satisfactory results, and seeks to overcome the limitations
encountered in the past. The aim is to produce a highly flexible,
easy-to-use testbed vehicle that will lend itself to a variety of
applications both in robotics and marine science. </p>

<p>Prospects for practical application are the guiding principle
in the ROMEO project, in consideration of the substantial investment
and effort required to develop and test new tools that can solve
the complex problems typical of the subsea environment. Besides
assisting scientists, ROMEO is also to serve as a testbed for the
development of UUV technology, particularly in the areas of
autonomous systems control and sensing. For both operational and research purposes,
the vehicle must be capable of high performance in attitude,
trajectory and hovering control and is required to handle
repetitive missions in a well-defined location on the sea bottom. </p>

<p>ROMEO has the same open-frame structure as the ROBY family,
which is easy to modify and maintain. The principle is to combine
small size and low weight with substantial payload capacity.
Great attention is being devoted to propulsion, seeking to ensure
maximum controllability and precision on the horizontal plane
while keeping pitch and roll to a miminum. Four symmetric
horizontal thrusters permit heading and hovering control and
horizontal motion in all directions; four vertical thrusters
allow depth and attitude control. The open-frame structure and
the propeller configuration make ROMEO more suitable for fine
manoeuvring rather than long-range autonomous navigation, allowing
it for instance to remain parallel to the sea bottom, at least up
to a certain inclination. </p>

<p>One of ROMEO's distinctive features is improved payload
capacity. The vehicle will be used for a variety of scientific applications,
such as real-time computer-assisted analysis of the sea bottom,
video recording and photo imaging, water measurement and
sampling, and seabed sampling. ROMEO is being constructed with an
eye to accommodating any special device needed by the final user.
Although the systems involved are widely available, they
generally require modification to take account of space
constraints and conditions in the underwater world. ROMEO's
payload chassis is designed to allow users to develop their own
system and easily mount it onto the vehicle. Chassis can be
removed and replaced without complex technical operations, thus
making it possible for users to mount several different chassis in sequence
onto to the vehicle during the same testing campaign. </p>

<p><font size="4">The vehicle's main features are</font>: </p>

<p align="left">The structure proposed in this paper has been
designed and implemented within the framework of the <a
href="/robotics/amadeus.htm">MAST II - AMADEUS</a> Project, whose
aim was to design, construct and test an advanced
non-anthropomorphic manipulator to be used in deep underwater
environments. A series of theoretic studies has been performed at
IAN-CNR in order to understand the global purpose of the Man
Machine Interface (MMI) system; the aim of this activity has been
not only to define the technical specifications of the system,
but also to understand how to maximize its efficiency and how to develop
the most rational <a href="mmi_ar.htm">architecture</a>: a
correct definition of tasks and good designing practice imply the
use of a fully modular structure; In particular, several issues
have been discussed and analyzed to define correctly the most important
MMI requirements: the necessity to deal with information which is
distributed over a series of different machines implies the
implementation of a standard <a href="mmi_com.htm">communication</a>
protocol; the continuous data exchange between modules implies
the use of a well-defined <a href="mmi_dat.htm">data structure</a>.
Synchronization techniques are used, and conflicts are managed by
appropriate regulation mechanisms. The MMI has been designed in a
way that will allow complete reuse for different marine robotics
applications, thanks to the total modularity and flexibility of
its structure; the same way, it grants the possibility of adding
new functionalities or hardware parts to the system, without any
substantial change in the control flow or having to redesign the
global control structure. One of the most meaningful tasks for a
MMI is to understand a human request, no matter what way it is
expressed (mouse, written language, voice, movement of virtual objects...),
interpret it and translate it into a series of commands which can
be used by the controlled machine. The MMI has the peculiarity of
easing manipulation of objects in a hostile environment: in
underwater applications, the possibility of taking accurate
measurements of objects&#146; features and positions (via a
video-camera, for example) is scarce: the <a href="mmi_fot.htm">MMI </a>can
provide the operator with feedback from the manipulator&#146;s
sensors, and give a description of environment and actions
through simulation. </p>

<p>This is a distributed, hierarchical control architecture based
on two different layers, with different computational capabilities:
the first with a low computation capability and very low power
requirements, and the second with large and expandable
computational power and higher power requirements. Some of the
modules of the layers are: #ABE: performs mission planning and
controls the operational activity of lower modules; it runs the
Forth language, which allows fast and simple mission programming;
each mission consists of a programmable sequence of vehicle movements,
sleeping periods and data collection operations; #NAV: the
navigator, whose task is to compute trajectories and execute
navigation algorithms; #CON: controls thrusters and executes
closed-loop control algorithms; #AM: handles the attitude
sensors: yaw, pitch and roll sensors, compass; #DP: handles the
depth sensors; #CAM: handles the image acquisition and storage
capabilities; </p>

<p>The architecture proposed is a testbed AUV based on the
breakdown of the overall vehicle control problem into a set of
different layers which are ordered according to the time
constraints of functions at each level. In classic control theories,
the time domain can be defined as the interval required by a
function to perform its action to completion. This is important
to take time domain into consideration when adding new functions
and, above all, new decision-making capabilities to a vehicle
which is already able to control its movement. As decision-making
capabilities are not of the rapid kind, the problem may be
resolved by layering all behaviours so that the upper layer
comprises longer time-consuming functions than the lower layer:
this is the concept of Hierarchical Time Domain. Hierarchical
layering based on time domains lets the system designer place any
function in a layer according to the time the function itself takes
to produce its results. </p>

<p>A layered, hierarchical architecture has been developed on the
basis of these considerations; moreover, as data acquisition and
management is strictly coupled with control, each level has been
designed with a data manipulation side and an action control
side, both managed by an appropriate module. Four different
levels have been designed. Real time level: the fastest level;
this executes sensor management, data processing, computation of
error signals and computation of effector settings; it is
composed of a Sensor Manager for data acquisition, and an
Effector Manager for motion control. System level: controls and
maintains the vehicle system, as well as determining how
accurately the desired path has been followed; Data Assessment
module receives data collected by the lower Sensor Manager and keeps
track of them, and is able to compute trends in data evolution;
the Guidance module stores a preprogrammed mission specification
and converts it into a series of motion commands, which are
transmitted to the Effector Manager for execution. Environment
level: this deals with the vehicle&#146;s physical environment;
the Situation Assessment module handles the process of building
an understanding of the current state of the world; it records
the state of the vehicle and the features of the surrounding
world, and communicates this information to the Navigator. The
latter&#146;s task is to manage route planning: on the basis of
information from mission description (waypoints, tasks to be
performed, goals), of its own world model, and of data concerning
present vehicle situation coming from Situation Assessment; the Navigator
can generate recursively a series of actions to be performed to
accomplish a sequence of subgoals. Mission level: the top level;
this handles aspects which are particular to the mission and the
tasks to be accomplished; it is a very high-level mission
planner, which uses descriptive data from the Environment level
to retrieve overall system state, and then applies these data to
current mission requirements to obtain a sequence of mission
goals the Navigator the can use and arrange. </p>

<p>This architecture is based on the subsumption approach, where
the concept of &#145;Level of Competence&#146; is strictly correlated
to that of &#145;Layer&#146;, the former being a general
description of a desired behaviour and the latter its implementation.
Three different levels of Competence describe the capabilities of
the system. Preservation Level: this performs obstacle avoidance
on the basis of variations in a potential field and the
subsequent search for a &#145;safety center&#146;; Exploration
Level: it performs high-level navigation and obstacle avoidance,
by adding biased random forces to the potential field of the
previous level: this way motion is encouraged in one direction by
breaking the &#145;dead zone&#146; of the potential;
Socialization Level: for object following; there is no explicit
coding of &#145;following objects&#146; but the behaviour is the
result of a summation of forces: attraction forces to turn the
machine towards an object, and repulsive forces to keep it from
colliding when the machine is getting too near an obstacle in the
motion direction. Different layers of control may be identified
within these functions, each one supported by the one below:
Estimate Ranges: measures distance to surrounding objects on the
basis of sensor data; Feel Force: produces the resultant force
vector, where force is a function of the inverse of a power of
measured distance; Flee Force: calculates the heading for Move; Move:
calculates the most appropriate set of velocities for the motors;
Pre-empt Collisions: sends collision warnings; Monitor Power:
determines how much power has been used on the basis of motor
settings; Brake: calculates reverse engine thrust if the vehicle
must be stopped; Estimate Dynamics: estimates the vehicle&#146;s
translational and rotational velocities and inclination; Swim
Around: generates the timed biased random vector to calculate
motion; Avoid: adds the new vector to Feel Force and suppresses
the output of Flee Force to allow the system to use the new
heading; Follow: monitors angles and forces and may suppress
heading calculated by lower levels if there could be an error; </p>

<p>The vehicle&#146;s architecture comprises several systems:
Support System: the energy distribution and monitoring module; its
task is also to handle emergency situations by surfacing the
vehicle. Propulsion System: controls propellers and rudders,
tracks a series of set points provided by the Dynamic Control
System; it also feeds back propulsion data to the Dynamic Control
System for closed loop control, and to the Mission Supervisor for
assessment of vehicle status. Dynamic Control System: accepts the
reference trajectory from the Mission Supervisor and the
information coming from the Navigation System and sends commands
to the Propulsion System. Environmental Inspection System: a series
of sensors for environmental data acquisition. Communications
System: manages communications between the vehicle and the human
operator, via exchange of messages, instructions, warnings and so
on; it is also responsible for the encoding and decoding of
messages. Navigation System: provides accurate estimates of
vehicle position and speed; it sends data to the Dynamic Control
System and to the Mission Supervisor for vehicle status and
performance assessment. Mission Supervisor: coordinates the
execution of mission tasks in accordance with the mission plan provided
by the operator; it is composed of three blocks: a Task
Scheduler, which performs task management on the basis of
operator&#146;s instructions and system status; a System
Coordination Module, to manage the exchange of information within
system modules; and a Status Assessment Module, which determines
vehicle status by examining data from the other modules. </p>

<p>The proposed control structure derives from the analysis of
the global system organization of the MARIUS AUV. In order to
achieve a well-defined plan and control mechanism, a hierarchical
structure is proposed, which to some extent recalls the concept
of Increasing Intelligence with Decreasing Precision. The
structure has a dynamic configuration capability: the system can
dynamically configure the connections between modules and store
information about the state of this configuration, in order to
allow the most suitable translations of planned actions into
commands. Moreover, the hierarchical structure allows the use of
some reactive behaviours, whose purpose is to handle safety and
integrity actions: they do not represent planned actions, but are
activated in certain conditions. </p>

<p>Three different layers are proposed. Organization level: the
Mission Planner uses a well defined language and grammar to
generate mission plans (waypoints and attitudes) on the basis of
the mission doctrine; Path Planner refines mission path in order
to obtain feasible trajectories; Mission Supervisor performs
mission monitoring, teleoperations and interaction with the
operator. Coordination level: coordinates the execution of
activities related to the accomplishment of mission goals; Plan
Interpreter generates a detailed action plan on the basis of
sensor information about the vehicle and the environment; Plan
Supervisor schedules the tasks for execution by the appropriate
functional modules and reacts to emergency conditions;
Architecture Coordinator manages the configuration of links
between the different modules of the functional layer: different
configurations may be scheduled depending on the evolution of the
mission situation, and the best available alternative is chosen;
dynamic adaptation of architecture to changing environmental conditions
is performed to maintain operational consistency; Task Refinement
transforms specified tasks into sequences of actions, according
to the mission context; Global Exception Handler is a high level
manager of error conditions and is invoked when lower level
modules are not able to cope with errors. Functional modules:
primitive modules are responsible for sensing and actuation, and
are connected according to decisions at the Coordination level; reactive
system behaviours correspond to different connections between
these modules; complex functional modules are composed of groups
of primitive modules in order to achieve higher level behaviours,
and to increase system modularity and expandability. </p>

<p>This is a hierarchical control structure for the NASA Space
Station Telerobot Control System. Even if NASREM has not been
designed for unmanned vehicle control, it has been included here
for comparison; its interest lies in the fact that it has been
successfully used, and it could be adapted for vehicle control.
It incorporates many AI concepts such as goal decomposition,
blackboard systems and expert systems, as well as aspects of
modern control theories, like adaptive control and learning. The
architecture is hierarchically structured into multiple layers
and vertically partitioned into three sections. The successive
layers are: Coordinate Transform: coordinate transformation and
output servoing; Primitive: computation of mechanical dynamics;
E-Move: obstacle detection and avoidance; Task: transformation of tasks
to be performed into effector movements; Service Bay: task
sequencing and scheduling; Service Mission: resource assignment;
The sections are: Sensory Processing: signal processing; pattern
recognition; correlation of observations and expectations; World
Modeling: CAD models of objects; maps of areas and volumes; lists
of objects and their attributes; tables of state variables; Task
Decomposition: planning and task monitoring; value-driven decisions;
servo control; interfaces for operator input. </p>

<p>The Rational Behaviour Model (RBM) architecture is based on
three levels of abstraction: Strategic, Tactical and Execution.
The use of different computer languages and different abstraction
mechanisms at each level offers important advantages in the
design and maintenance of control software. RBM is a
specialization of the SSS (Symbolic, Subsumption, Servo)
architecture. Strategic level: entirely symbolic, with no global
variables; its task is to designate and sequence particular goals
through decisional processes; it uses rule-based languages,
Prolog and Clips; it executes top-down mission analysis based on
goal-directed reasoning, and decomposition of the root goal into
a sequence of primitive goals, until they can be simplified no
further, and sends direct implementation messages to the Tactical
level; it has non-interruptible functioning, is not event-driven,
and receives lower level information by a polling technique. Tactical
level: asynchronous interface between the other two levels; it
decomposes high-level tasks so as to produce commands for lower
level execution; it uses languages that support object
hierarchies and event-driven multitasking, such as CLOS (the
object-oriented version of Common Lisp) or ADA; it is a
collection of objects and related methods, which may call on
other methods at the same level or send commands to the Execution
level; it executes data collection and replanning, if needed; in
order to prevent conflicts between behaviors, this level is
implemented as a hierarchy of objects: offspring objects are
components of parent objects and can only be accessed by them,
while the single root object is responsible both for
communications with the Strategic level and for transmission of
orders to the Execution level; decisions are made in response to
queries received from the high level at any time, and information from
the lower level is received using &#145;interrupt&#146;
techniques. Execution level: synchronous and entirely numerical
level; it operates vehicle actuators and sensors in response to
higher-level commands; it uses languages such as C, C++ and ADA,
which work within multitasking operating systems and utilize
timed interrupts; all commands and actions which could endanger
the vehicle are overridden here. </p>

<p>This is a mixed hierarchical and parallel architecture, with a
Supervisor that handles mission parameters on the basis of lower-level
information and three separate block functions, each with four
levels of intelligence: Sensory Data Base deals with the
environment, its representation and sensing; Knowledge Base
handles system knowledge according to particular Rules; Planner
deals with problems related to vehicle heading and control. A
particular adaptive approach has been adopted for vehicle
control: a Parameter Adaptation Algorithm is used to estimate
system and environmental parameters, so that the control
structure can quickly adapt to changing conditions: this is
performed by means of a neural network, whose advantage is the
ability to adapt to structural changes. </p>

<p>This structure consists of a layered control in which
behaviors play a key role and is composed of three levels: Dynamic
Control: manages the actuators and gives them instructions in
order to achieve the goal which has been determined higher up by
Layered Control; Layered Control: determines mission
configuration and manages vehicle behaviour; Mission Supervisor:
supervises mission control, accepts commands from the human
operator, handles vehicle control parameters and manages
different behaviors; This architecture is based on the concept of state-configured
Layered Control, whose basic unit is behaviour. Mission
specifications consist of a set of particular blocks, each one
having a particular task to perform. These blocks are
characterized by a particular state, and are connected through a
network of transition rules, which constitute the conditions for
modifying vehicle operating modes. Each block is composed of a
series of behaviors that encompass separate basic mission skills,
such as obstacle avoidance, bottom following, message posting,
reaching a given point, and so on. One important part of the
control architecture is data structure, which is able to keep
track of vehicle status and support the required behaviors: the Database
module contains a set of values collected by the sensors, as well
as a description of their features, while Behaviors Library
contains all available behaviors that can be managed and used
within blocks of Layered Control. This data structure also
contains a description of the actual configuration of Layered
Control. The whole control structure has been implemented on a
system that runs on the OS9 real-time multitasking operating
system. </p>

<p>Proteus is not a vehicle, but a configurable architecture for
control systems, composed of a hybrid between a highly structured
hierarchical control system and a purely distributed layered
control organization based on subsumption. The system is
hierarchically partitioned, and layered at each level of the
hierarchy, with the addition of cooperative functions. Proteus is
an extension of the &#145;event and action&#146; scheduler, as it
is event-based and the concept of subsumption is applied. The
system is made up of several basic components (called atoms),
each one having its own function, input and output. All these
general-purpose components can be stored in a library and reused,
so that constructing a particular mission simply consists in
choosing the required components from the library and defining interconnections.
Events are data flows linking some components and activating
their actions. In order to achieve more reliable results, the
technique of cooperation is used, sometimes allowing atoms to
share the same actuator rather than merely acting in a
subsumptive way. To solve problems related to interaction between
components with different speeds, a hierarchical structure is
implemented with a supervisory system of some kind. This can be,
for example, a Navigation Module which generates points for the
Heading Control module, which in turn generates commands for Actuator
Control. Missions are composed of sequences of operations called
tasks: to represent and configure a mission, the operator uses a
particular language to give instructions through a &#145;script
editor&#146;. A script is a collection of sequential steps, each
of which may contain more than one task to perform. </p>

<p>A typical control cycle for the system can be defined by the
concept of situation differentiation: on the basis of the idea that
&#147;to perceive is to distinguish&#148; , actions are decided
in relation to what is perceived as happening in the environment:
the sensors play the key role of differentiating situations to
allow the appropriate actions to be performed. The state of
sensors, actuators and the environment is represented by three
state vectors, whereas connections between them represent
functions linking the different states. Sensor space provides all
vehicle control information and is able to differentiate between
situations. Actuator space controls vehicle actuators and thus
influences environmental status. Environment space represents the
real world as influenced by actuators and perceived by sensors:
it determines whether the goal of a given task has been reached.
This control structure has been tested on ISER&#146;s ARCS AUV,
and used on the Theseus (in the picture) vehicle. </p>

<p>This vehicle can be classed as a &quot;Virtual AUV&quot;, in
that it is an ROV with a particularly high-powered control
console, great sensorial capabilities and excellent operational
features. Its distributed architecture is of the MASTER/SLAVE type,
where the SLAVE (on board the vehicle) is initially used only for
communication management, data acquisition and execution of
elementary control actions, while the MASTER (in the control
console) is dedicated to the management of the operator interface
and to all mission-related analysis and control functions. The
control structure is composed of five main modules: <u>Navigator,
Motion System, Sensing System, World Model , World Interpreter</u>. Sensing
System: composed of sensors to collect information and a sensor
filtering system to ensure that the measurement of
robot-environment relations is reliable; three classes of
sensors: self-knowledge, kinematics and environmental. World
Model: represents, at various degrees of abstraction, the spatial
arrangement of objects and parameters of various nature;
objective, a priori information may be updated with data from the
Navigator and the World Interpreter. World Interpreter: utilizes
a priori information provided by users, and updates information
on the basis of the latest experience and sensor measurements;
data fusion in a complex 3D model. Navigator: composed of three
modules: Mission Planner, which, on the basis of mission
requirements and the world model, dynamically establishes a
sequence of way-points (each visible from the preceding ones) and
operations to be performed at each one, and supplies the Path
Planner with the current target (3D point) to be reached; Path
Planner which dynamically determines the path to be followed to
reach current target point and performs obstacle avoidance; Auto
Pilot or Path Follower which interfaces the Navigator with the
Motion System, driving the vehicle along the route established by Path
Planner. Motion System: composed of two modules: Actuator, or
engines, and Control, which pilots the actuators to perform
actions dictated by Path Follower, thus allowing the operator to
control overall system motion rather than single engine
parameters. </p>

<p>Control architecture for unmanned underwater vehicles, tested
on a SPRINT ROV. A distributed, supervised architecture composed
of different modules: Sprint: interface between the vehicle and
the control program; Sonar: management of the sonar unit;
Distance: analysis of sonar data; Move: computation of relative
movements on the basis of sensory data; Collision: obstacle
detection; Position: vehicle position fixing on the basis of data
from Collision, Move and internal maps; Control: control of
vehicle behaviour on the basis of determined path and measured
data; Waypoint: piloting the vehicle to certain locations by
setting heading and speed on the basis of sensory data; error handling;
Path Plan: path planning on the basis of mission instructions,
current position and existing maps; replanning; Captain:
generation of mission requirements from the operator&#146;s
instructions, and conversion of requirements into a series of
commands for other modules; Error Handler: global management of
error detection and error recovery; Modularity is based on the
kinds of functions to be performed, and abstraction levels are
considered in relation to the kind of data a given function or
module is to handle. Typical layer division is as follows, with
the assignment of each module to the appropriate layer: Sensor:
Control, Distance, Move; Mapping and sensory data management: Waypoint,
Collision, Position; Geometry: Path Plan and Video Control;
Planning: Captain; </p>

<p>Task Based Control is a control architecture developed for
cooperating robotic manipulators and for free-flying space robots;
it has been successfully used by the MBARI vehicle, and on JASON,
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute&#146;s vehicle. TBC is a
hierarchical architecture composed of three levels: Servo Level
or Hardware Level: performs direct control of the actuators
through closed-loop algorithms; Coordination Level: constitutes
the interface between the other two levels, and may also be
called the Task Level; it is composed of &#145;tasks&#146;, i.e.
autonomous or semi-autonomous actions that the vehicle can
perform without human supervision; Organizational Level: performs high-level
mission planning, unexpected situation handling, data
interpretation and so on, and it is managed by a human operator; </p>

<p>Task Based Control has been conceived as a system for
tele-operated or semi-autonomous vehicles, which reduces communication
link problems, such as performance degradation due to bandwidth
restrictions: a set of task-level commands is defined, each
allowing the vehicle to perform a given action. A high-level
language, composed of high-density instructions, can be used to
handle transmission between the different levels. Different
methods have been used to encode tasks, including rule-based
systems (NPS) and Finite State Machines. </p>

<p>This Distributed Vehicle Management Architecture (DVMA) is a
software structure that can generate a sequence of behaviors to
handle missions, i.e. to organize vehicle behaviors according to
the specified mission. </p>

<p>DVMA consists of three hierarchical layers of software
modules: Hardware level: the bottom level, which directly controls
hardware interfaces. Functional level: composed of
&#145;functional modules&#146; whose aim is to organize specified behaviours.
An inter-layer communication module, for communications with the
upper level, is also included; the operation of these modules is
directed by particular &#145;behavioral scripts&#146;. Behavioral
level: the top level, where system status is determined; composed
of modules that can make decisions according to mission
specifications and current situation; they can exchange messages
and send commands to the functional modules to perform necessary
actions to achieve specific mission behaviour; each action is
called a &#145;behavioral mode&#146;: behavioral mode may be
changed only at behavioral level, independent of other levels.
Vehicle behaviour can only be determined by concentrating on the behavioral
level and acting within it. Vehicle functions can be extended by
preparing a software module for the new function and modifying
some behavioral script. </p>

<p>This is a three-layered architecture in which commands are
sent by each layer to the one below. The layers manage waypoint
execution, obstacle avoidance and motion control. From bottom to
top: Servo Controller: receives heading and pitch angle commands
and sends thrusters commands; Obstacle Avoidance: uses the sonar
data to calculate headings and avoid obstacles; Route Tracking:
produces the sequence of waypoints to follow and checks if the
given goal has been achieved. </p>

<p>The VORTEX vehicle's on-board electronics system only performs
basic control of engines and sensors; all the vehicle control
software is located on a surface computer. The control software
is a real-time, object-oriented system based on a C++ approach;
object classes are applied to the vehicle's different types of
subsystems: sensors, actuators, control laws, filters. The
operating system is VxWorks. Two kinds of control laws are
applied: basic and complex control tasks: Basic control tasks:
control of the vehicle's main state variables, governing the
vehicle's internal state and enabling it to reach and maintain a
given state. Complex control tasks: higher-level vehicle control
laws for performance of different missions; these use data
provided by sensors to perform specific tasks (wall following,
target detection and tracking). A mission is defined by a set of
scheduled actions, each one modeled as a control task with functional
and behavioral aspects; mission behaviour is event-driven, i.e.
its definition (start, end, task activation, recovery...) entails
defining a set of signals for handling. The synchronous
programming of reactive systems is performed through the use of
the Esterel Language. The proposed top-down architecture is
composed of different modules: Interpretation module: reads the
plan written by the operator via the user interface and, by
translating instructions, acts as an interface between the
operator and other modules. Knowledge data base: contains all
data related to the robot and the environment, as well as models
of actions and the representation of actions in progress; it also
contains some particular conditions which must be checked before
an action can be performed. Inference module: supervises the
execution of actions by checking their associated rules.
Execution module: constitutes the interface between the control
system and machine actuators and sensors; it manages
communications between the different modules and translates
messages and commands into orders, which are interpreted and
executed by the machine. </p>

<strong>Massimo CACCIA</strong><br>
Research Scientist</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Massimo Caccia received his degree in Electronic Engineering from Genoa University in 1991, with a thesis on 
Automated Planning of Autonomous Vehicle Motion. In the same year he obtained a Post-Graduate Research Grant 
from Ansaldo DNU-RTL to study sonar-based motion planning and control in wheeled land vehicles. In 1993 he 
collaborated with the Telerobot Consortium, focusing on real-time control architectures.</p>
<p>&#160;In May 1993 he joined the Istituto Automazione Navale (IAN) of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Genoa as a 
Research Scientist. His research at IAN has encompassed numerous subjects, notably: intelligent control and software 
architectures for underwater vehicles; sensor-based navigation (acoustic motion estimation and world modelling); 
guidance and control of UUVs; UUV simulation and identification; in-water testing.</p>
<p>&#160;He has devoted particular attention to the following areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Study of intelligent control architectures for complex robotic systems; design of the control and 
software architectures for IAN&#146;s prototype underwater vehicles Roby and Romeo;</li>
<li>Development of a dynamic simulator for underwater vehicles based on a simple uncoupled 
model and on PECE numeric integration methods</li>
<li>In-water testing of the vehicle Roby and identification of its heading and depth sensors, its 
hydrodynamic coefficients and the parameters of its propellers; identification of the parameters 
of ROMEO&#146;s propellers;</li>
<li>Construction of an autopilot based on PID techniques for the vehicle Roby; development of a 
regulator for heading control in underwater vehicles based on fuzzy logic methods;</li>
<li>Sonar-based reconstruction of a 2-D map of a structured environment in the case of known 
sensor position; integration of these mapping methods with acoustic localization methods 
developed at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey;</li>
<li>Joint study with the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey for sonar-based estimation of the 
World Model of an underwater vehicle and sonar-based estimation of underwater vehicle 
motion relative to a scanned surface</li>
<li>Joint study with the Instituto de Sistemas e Robotica in Lisbon for the definition of an interface 
between Roby&#146;s control software and the mission manager based on Petri Nets in use at the 
Portuguese centre.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The global MMI structure is composed of a series
of different modules: a nucleus (kernel), several independent processes
and a Common Memory Area (MECON). The <a href="mmi_nuc.htm">nucleus </a>contains
all functions related to the management of work sessions, data
storage and general graphic interface functions. The independent
processes are related to specific activities and each refers to a
particular window. The <a href="mmi_ap.htm">Application Processes</a>
are a series of concurrent processes which are regulated and
managed by kernel modules. MECON stores all data which can be
used by more than one module and by processes, and all messages
which can be exchanged with the &#145;actuation&#146; parts of
the gripper. All communications between modules are provided via
a series of queues, and conflicts between concurrent processes are
managed by appropriate regulation mechanisms (semaphores). </p>

<h2><i>Data Structure</i></h2>

<p><i>Data</i></p>

<p>Data packets are received by the MMI in an asynchronous way.
The structure of each packet is composed of several fields: 'data
family', to distinguish between different kinds of messages;
'packet number', to handle correctly the sequence of actions; and
'message content', with series of data describing the gripper
status. The &#145;message content&#146; part of the packet
contains data related to: <i>the hydraulic system</i>, the
pressure values of pumps in each finger; <i>the gripper shape and
positioning</i>, the frames with the 3D coordinates and
orientations of the fingers' main points; <i>forces and torques</i>
at contact locations; <i>slipping values</i> at contact
locations; </p>

<p><i>Commands</i></p>

<p>Command packets are sent to the LAN in an asynchronous way.
The structure of each packet is composed of: 'command family' and
'OPcode', to distinguish between different kinds of commands;
'packet number', to handle correctly the sequence of actions to
control; 'message content', composed of a series of fixed and
well-defined parameters describing the present actuation strategy
as decided by the human operator. The &#145;message content&#146;
part of the packet contains instructions related to: <i>press</i>
commands, the pressures of tubes inside the fingers; <i>bend</i> commands,
length, bend and spin value as defined for each finger; <i>gripper</i>
commands, the orders to grasp, manipulate or release an object; <i>status</i>
commands, to shut down the whole manipulating system. An
appropriate combination of codes written in the &#145;command
family&#146; and in the &#145;Opcode&#146; field of the packet
allows the MMI to determine the exact command the human operator
wants to issue. </p>

<h2><i>Kernel</i></h2>

<p align="center"><img src="mmi3.gif" align="center" width="497"
height="368"> </p>

<p align="left">The MMI Kernel is formed by the following
modules: </p>

<p><i>Boss</i></p>

<p>The main initialisation system whose purpose is to manage the
user&#146;s graphic interface. It controls the system's global initialization
procedures. It manages the input devices (mouse, keyboard ,
9-knob board) and data entry into the system; it also displays
all messages answering system events, as well as diagnostic and
error messages. The Boss also runs a multi-level menu structure
that activates all windows and MMI modules. </p>

<p><i>Slider</i></p>

<p>Runs independent processes and manages conflicts in all
situations in which concurrent mode is needed. All application processes
are managed via a series of &#145;fork&#146; calls and
communications with other modules are granted by the defined queues. </p>

<p><i>Keeper</i></p>

<p>Manages the Common memory area. It receives messages from High
Level Control, verifies their integrity and inserts them into
MECON. It checks for command messages in MECON and dispatches
them to lower control levels. All communications with the other
MMI modules are granted by the defined queues while
communications with lower control levels are achieved via LAN
links. In the case of loss of data linkage, Keeper waits ten
minutes and then assumes that an unrecoverable error or shutdown
has occurred in one of lower modules. </p>

<p><i>Recorder</i></p>

<p>Saves on disk all significant data and commands processed by
the MMI. This allows the user to obtain up-to-date information
about all MMI operation modes and actions so that an analysis of
the system work-flow can be carried out. Every active MMI process
and module writes significant data in a buffer inside MECON, and
the Recorder&#146;s task is to read the buffer and transfer
information into disk file(s). </p>

<h2><i>Application Processes</i></h2>

<p align="center"><img src="mmi5.gif" align="center" width="504"
height="453"> </p>

<p align="left">The Application Processes have direct
responsibility for managing data, controlling workflows and
viewing the necessary information. </p>

<p><i>Session</i></p>

<p>The MMI session control process. It enables the user to set
all session parameters (software parameters, working directories,
projects, priorities, and so on). It also monitors and displays
the actual parameters, such as communications status, working
status of processes, status of lower-level processes, and so on. </p>

<p><i>3Dgraph</i></p>

<p>The 3D graphic representation process. Its task is to create a
synthetic image of the gripper on the basis of its geometrical
model and of status information contained in MECON and received
from the HLC. Special graphic techniques allow the user to choose
the preferred viewing options: type of visualisation, point of
view, distance, and so on. </p>

<p><i>Press</i></p>

<p>The pressure control process. It lets the user manually
control the pressure of gripper palm and fingers. It can manage parameters
such as: <i>Knuckle</i>: angle between palm and fingers; and <i>Pressure</i>
of tubes in each finger; </p>

<p><i>Finger</i></p>

<p>The finger control process. It allows the user to manually set
the geometric position of the fingers. It can manage parameters
such as: <i>Knuckle</i>: angle between palm and fingers; <i>Length</i>:
length of each finger; <i>Bend</i>: curvature of each finger; <i>Spin</i>:
rotation angle of the curvature plane of each finger. </p>

<p><i>Grip</i></p>

<p>The gripper control process. Its task is to enable the user to
manage the high-level and automatic operations of grasping,
releasing and manipulating objects. This module is give the
pre-defined values of: <i>Speed</i>: maximum working speed at
fingers; <i>Force</i>: maximum force the gripper can exert on
objects. It also gives the gripper some fundamental high-level
commands, such as: <i>Grasp</i>: grasp an object; the pre-defined
values of force and speed may be used; <i>Manipulate</i>: rotate
and translate the object on the basis of defined values
describing the desired offset in position and spatial
orientation, and which can be entered in the system through a
procedure that will be described in the &#145;Data Entry&#146;
section; <i>Release</i>: release the object; the pre-defined
speed value may be used. </p>

<p><i>Monitor</i></p>

<p>The data monitoring process. Its purpose is to display the
status of selected variables and parameters which could be read
in MECON. </p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>HOPE&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;MANKIND? YOU&nbsp;DECIDE.</H1>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="monkburn.gif" HEIGHT=300 WIDTH=300></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="http://www.fva.org/1095/monks.html">Venerable Thich
Quang Do</A> on June 11, 1963.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>This Buddhist monk burned himself alive to send a message into
our minds and hearts. The image of a burning monk seared itself onto the
world's conscience and sharpened focus on Vietnam's civil strife. How far
will YOU go for what YOU BELIEVE&nbsp;IN? Obviously you don't have to go
this far. &nbsp;It is just an example of how far some people will go for
what they believe in.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>My belief is this: Even though most of the actions of the world
bring us closer to our certain destruction, the future is not fixed. &nbsp;Meaning
if you went back in time 5 times you would get the same results each time
you went. &nbsp;But if you went into the future 5 times it could be different
each time. This is because man has Free Will and has the opportunity to
change his future. &nbsp;The future is not fixed. A small effort on the
part of each person could change our current heading and start to reverse
the horrid disasters of which most are man made.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>We are currently destroying our planet in the following ways
&amp; more.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>1. Fossil Fuel.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>2. Nuclear Energy.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>3. Deforestation of the Rain Forests.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>4. Pollution of the Air, Soil, Water table, Oceans, Magnettic
spectrums.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>5. Overpopulation.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>6. Manipulation and destruction of the Animal Kingdom's natural
evolution.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>7. Morally: The world is full of HATE &amp; Jealousy.</P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Why should YOU care? &nbsp;The New World Order or whoever THEY
may be are too powerful for me to stop? Well perhaps you're right, you
miss the destruction of the world and you die young, you'll never have
to come back to this planet to see what happened right! &quot;You only
live Once..&quot; as the saying goes. &nbsp;Let's hope then for YOUR sake
that the saying is true or it may just be YOU who has to come back to earth
to live in a toxic wasteland. What can you do? </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The religious beliefs of man have been manipulated and mistranslated
through difffernt languages, most of the true meaning has been lost or
covered up in lessons of Fear. The Buddhist's are one of the only religions
who do not condem you for not belonging to their religious beliefs. &nbsp;You
should form your own opinion of God or whatever title you choose to give
the Grand Architect of the Universe. There is tremendous quantities of
truth in this world buried and uncovered, scattered under our noses most
of the time. But unless you look for it you will overlook it and be left
in the dark. </P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>Yes it is difficult to be labled different, to go against the
flow. So either decide now, Go with the flow. &nbsp;Or &quot;OPEN&nbsp;UP&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;MIND&nbsp;AND&nbsp;GO&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;OWN&nbsp;WAY.&quot;
(C) <A HREF="sepul.html">SEPULTURA</A> . You can teach the young to believe
in more than what the textbooks barely teach them, show them some of the
facts you have learned here and give them your opinions. It is a difficult
task but a rewarding one. If one person out of ten expands his mind to
a new level it will have been worth your effort. With knowledge and effort
and communication between like minded people I believe that the fate of
the world is not limited to doom just yet. Thank's for your time. We hope
you have learned a few things. Or at least have opened up to speculation
of things that could actually be!</P></CENTER>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The UMF&nbsp;MAG's all started in the form of text based
zines and articles released and spread througout the Amiga computer scene
in 1985-1994. These small text based magazines designed to focus interesting
scientific and strange world events into a single reading which normally
would be strewn througout the media and papers. We are happy to see, thanks
to the internet, Freedom of Information of such topics has increased tremdously
and has put light info into the minds of thousands of people who were in
the dark. We no longer make these Mags but we have concentrated instead
on this web site for distrubition of all the knowledge we gather on our
journey. &nbsp;But for your entertainment we have provided the Original
UMF&nbsp;MAG's Issues 1-7 online here. These were our first attempts of
spreading knowledge across the globe to all platforms in the unrestricted
BBS days. Enjoy.</H2>

the closest astronomical body to the Earth and we know more about it than
any other object in the heavens. Many surface features are visible to the

A small telescope shows vast seas of lava, large mountain ranges and hundreds
of craters of all sizes. Studies of the 382 kg of lunar rock and soil brought
back by the Apollo missions have revealed much about the early history
of both the Moon and the Earth. </P></CENTER>

<P>ARTICLE #1</P>

<P>OMNI: ANTIMATTER MAY 1993</P>

<P>TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF</P>

<P>Martian Mystery: Is the Red Planet host to a third lunar body or UFOs?</P>

<P>When a Soviet probe spun out of control near Phobos, one of two Martian
moons, experts called the accident an unavoidable hazard of venturing on
high. But to some members of the UFO community, the crash was the evil
handiwork of aliens based on Phobos for years. Fueling this otherworldy
rumor, it seems, was a statement by none other than Alexander Dunayev,
chairman of the Soviet SPace organization responsible for the space probe,
named Phobos 2. The doomed craft, Dunayev stated, had photographed the
imaged of an odd-shaped object between itself and Mars. The object could
have been &quot;debris in the orbit of Phobos,&quot; Dunayev suggested,
or perhaps the spacecraft's jettisoned &quot;autonomous propulsion subsystem.&quot;
But his tone of uncertainty-and the fact that the Russians never released
the spacecraft's final photographs-left saucer buffs guessing the mysterious
object had been a genuine UFO. Their suspicions were heightened just recently
when retired Soviet Col. Marina Popovich made a trip to the United States.
Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles, UFO advocate Popovich stated
that the object had measured a whopping 25 kilometers, or 15.5 miles, in
length. A former test pilot and the wife of a highly decorated cosmonaut,
Gen. Pavel Popovich, the visiting colonel said she had received the alarming
photo itself from cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, her friend. But if Washing,
DC, Astronomer Tom Van Flandern, formerly of the U.S. Naval Observatory
and now head of his own group, Meta Research, is correct, the failure of
the probe was no mystery at all. The Soviets had long said that the craft
had spun out of control because of an erroneous ground command on March
27, Van Flandern discovered, yet the photo of the mystery object had been
dated March 25. &quot;it was unlikely,&quot; he explains, &quot;that the
object in the photo had anything to do with the spacecraft's demise.&quot;
To determine the identity of the object, however, Van Flandern analyzed
the picture. &quot;The first thing that struck me,&quot; he explains, &quot;is
that the object was similar in brightness to Phobos, and asteroid like
body that is carbonaceous and dark.&quot; It did not reflect light as a
metallic, artificial object would. Van Flandern also examined the timing
of the Phobos II camera, set to track the motion of the Martian moon. Anything
not matching the moon's relative motion would appear to streak or trail
across the photographic page. Thus, the &quot;streak,&quot; thought to
be 25 kilometers long was, in face, a much smaller object imprinting its
motion, not its length, across the image. Only the very end of the enlongated
streak hints at the object's true shape: rounded but irregular, with one
end narrower than the other. To Van Flandern, the clues suggest the mystery
object was a moonlet, or a third, miniature Martian moon. Of course, Van
Flandern's conclusion has not pleased everybody. one German researcher
says the image is just an artifact produced by the malfunction of the Phobos
2 camera in space. And Popovich contends the object may be an alien craft.
To make her point, she has even given a copy of the telling photo to Don
Ecker, director of research for UFO Magazine, based in Los Angeles. Ecker,
deferring to &quot;the facts as presented by the Russians,&quot; favors
the notion of a Mars-based UFO. But Van Flandern contends the lack of alien
involvement in the image should not detract from its importance: &quot;It
is an exciting astronomical discovery,&quot; he contends, &quot;and means
that instead of just two moons revolving around Mars, we may have three.&quot;</P>

<P>ARTICLE #2</P>

<P>&quot;SPACED OUT&quot;</P>

<P>Starstruck UFO freaks and the company they keep..</P>

<P>(Fringe-Group Profile by Doug Vincent)</P>

<P>Typed in by [MEtONeR]-TRSI</P>

<P>What's the difference between a transplanted alien from Venus and a
raving lunatic at a space nut convention? Who knows?</P>

<P>The audience sits spellbound as the elderly gentleman before them tells
his story. His name is Alfred Bielek, he says, and he's a survivor of an
incredible, secret U.S. military operation called the &quot;Philadelphia
Experiment&quot;</P>

<P>According to Bielek, in 1943 the U.S. Navy used Einstein's Unified Field
Theory to successfully turn the warship U.S.S. Eldridge entirely invisible.
When the ship reappeared, however, some crewmen inexplicably burst into
flames. The bodies of others were horribly buried within the metal bulwark
of the ship. Those that remained went insane.</P>

<P>Bielek and his brother, deep in the hold of the ship, were somehow spared
the terrible fate of their fellow crewmen. Undeterred by the tragic results
of the initial test trial, however, the Navy, anxious to employ this spectacular
advantage over the Nazis, involved them in a second attempt three weeks
later, this time striving only to render the warship invisible to radar-supposedly
a simpler, less deadly ambition.</P>

<P>Again, thanks to Einsteinian, top-secret physics break- throughs, the
experiment worked. The Eldridge became radar invisible for about a minute-afterwhich,
to the Navy's consternation, there was a blue flash, and the ship vanished
completely.</P>

<P>The Bieleks-apparently protected by a special energy field in the ship's
hold-recognized the now familiar signs of incipient insanity in their defenseless
shipmates and jumped overboard. Instead of finding themselves floating
in the chilly waters of Philadelphia Harbor, however, they landed on solid
ground at Montauk Army Base in Long Island, New York- In 1983-where they
were greeted by the project's director, Dr. John Von Neumann, who had waited
40 years for their arrival.</P>

<P>Bielek was sent back in time to 1943. There he was brain- washed by
military brass, given a new identity and set free to live his life anew,
totally unaware of what had happened to him.</P>

<P>Alfred Bielek's audience at the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference
in Phoenix, Arizona, hangs on every word. After the oldster's disturbing
revelation, hundreds jockey for the chance to query him on every sensational
aspect of his incredible tale. Many pay an additional fee for his special
evening workshop, where Bielek discusses the Philadelphia Experiment and
other government cover-ups.</P>

<P>Bielek's proof that his story is true? Nothing but the sudden recollection
of his incredible adventure during a visit to Montauk Army Base after having
seen the science fiction movie The Philadelphia Experiment.</P>

<P>Lack of hard evidence doesn't deter conference attendees from avidly
supporting Bielek's astounding revelation. Most are convinced he is telling
the truth.</P>

<P>&quot;Why would he lie?&quot; asks a fiery conference attendee, a gray-haired,
grandmotherly woman. &quot;In light of Watergate and Contragate, and all
the other -gates, Alfred Bielek's story makes perfect sense. The government
will do anything to protect its ass. The cover-up of the Philadelphia Experiment
is a prime example. I think poor Mr. Bielek should be compensated for the
hell he's been through!&quot;</P>

<P>The woman's female companion, her sweater decorated with a We Are Not
Alone! button, agrees. &quot;The reality of time travel makes perfect sense,&quot;
she declares. &quot;I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that the
government discovered how to do it with help from extraterrestrial visitors.
How can any ordinary person describe the tremendous technological achie-
vements scientists have made in just a few years? People like Al Bielek
should be congratulated for coming forward with the truth.&quot; Following
Bielek on the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference's schedule of
amazements, hypnotherapist Calvin Vanness and psychic Jack Stephens directors
of the House of the Dawn, a metaphysics center in Phoenix, Arizona, purportedly
channel the spirit of Nikola Tesla, the creator of the Tesla electrical
coil and the rumored mastermind behind the so called Philadelphia Experiment.</P>

<P>Rambling in an odd, middle-European accent, Stephens/Tesla warns that
the Earth is going to hell in a handbasket, and that things will get worse
unless changes are made, after which dozens of people wave hands in the
air, eager to ask the chann- eled spirit of the long-deceased electrical
genius more infor- mation on his involvement with the Philadelphia Experiment
and the fate of the planet.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>The National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference is one of dozens of
such symposiums covering the broad spectrum of UFO research, New Age prophecy
and high weirdness held each year around the country.</P>

<P>Judging by the vocal testimony of the audiences these assem- blies attract,
the vast majority of Americans who are fasc- inated by UFOs and associated
paranormal activity sincerely believe in the existence of alien spacecraft.
Many, in fact, are convinced they've had extraterrestrial encounters of
some sort.</P>

<P>Quiet, serene New Ager Jerry Wills claims he used to be a UFO alien,
no less. According to Wills, his alien self died when his spaceship crashed
in the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. His extraterrestrial
spirit wandered through the land for five years before finding a home inside
the obliging consciousness of a Kentucky infant named Jerry Wills.</P>

<P>Wills claims his first close encounter with a fellow star person came
when he was 13 years old. Some time later, he fell ill and believed he
was going to die. That night, a group of extraterrestrials took him aboard
their craft and administered a healing medication. He recovered quickly,
and has been relatively healthy since.</P>

<P>Wills says he observed American prisoners being used as guinea pigs
during the testing of nuclear bombs in the Nevada desert. These unlucky
men and women were promised freedom if they survived, he says, and free
medical care if problems arose. Unfortunately, nothing has been heard of
them since.</P>

<P>Like Al Bielek, Wills has little to offer as proof of his astounding
tale. Nevertheless, he is regularly mobbed at UFO conventions by people
anxious to tell him they think they were &quot;walk-ins&quot; (stranded
aliens) like him. At the 1992 Inter- national Symposium on UFO Research
in Denver, Colorado, a woman known only as Sheila happily proclaimed that
she herself might have been an extraterrestrial in another life, an obser-
vation apparently corroborated through hypnotic regression-a form of hypnosis
regressing its subject to the reaches of earliest memory.</P>

<P>That wasn't all, Sheila ecstatically related. In another regression,
she found out that she'd been Moses's sister in Biblical times!</P>

<P>Joining Bielek, Wills and other firsthand UFOologist at the New Age
and Alien Agenda Conference is a gospel minister named Dr. Frank Stranges.
Stranges claims to have met a kindly visitor from Venus who had taken part
in top-level discussions at the Pentagon.</P>

<P>The alien told Stranges his name was Valient Thor (though his friends
called him Val), and he purported to be visiting Earth to help the peoples
of all nations, though the specific nature of Val's employment at the Pentagon
was kept a mystery. Val was obviously an alien, according to Stranges,
because he had no finger-prints, could heal people with a single touch
and wore an indestructible coat.</P>

<P>Pentagon officials deny any knowledge of the friendly, helpful Venusian,
Stranges says, but he feels the infor- mation is too spectacular to keep
to himself.</P>

<P>A pretty blonde from Oaklahoma, named Christa Tilton, tells an enthralled
crowd at the National New Age and Alien Agenda Conference that she has
been repeatedly impregnated by the aliens-and that the extraterrestrials
later snatched the fetuses from her womb. Tolton is convinced that the
episode was the insidious work of aliens because she became pregnant during
a period when she wasn't sexually active.</P>

<P>Tilton claims that in 1987 she was taken into an underground facility
beneath the Oaklahoma desert, where she saw human military personnel and
extraterrestrials working side by side on extremely mysterious projects.</P>

<P>During that visit, Tilton announces, she was taken into a private room
and given a pelvic exam by human and alien doctors. Afterward, she was
made to forget the entire visit, and returned to her home in Tucson, Arizona.
The episode finally came to light when she underwent hypnotherapy to deal
with some disturb- ing dreams.</P>

<P>&quot;That poor girl,&quot; laments a tall, lanky man to the woman sitt-
ing next to him. &quot;What a horrible, horrible experience. Some of those
aliens are real bastards.&quot; The woman nods sympathetically.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>Many UFOologists anticipate the future disclosure of a bizarre working
relationship between extraterrestrials and the United States government.
According to spacecase symposium rumor, the U.S. government has been in
cahoots with alien forces for decades.</P>

<P>*The U.S. military is working hand in hand with ETs to create an alien/human
hybrid, which explains why many female abductees report having eggs or
fetuses removed from their bodies during examination by extraterrestrials.
*Aliens keep track of the humans they abduct by implanting special receiver/transmitters
in their ears or noses. *A secret cabal of U.S. military leaders known
as Majestic-12 was established in 1947 by an executive order from President
Harry Truman, created as a liaison between the U.S. government and extraterrestrial
civilizations. *The military has dozens of dead aliens on ice at installations
nationwide, and also dozens of downed alien spacecraft, which are routinely
test-flown at a secret part of Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base known only
as Area 51.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>A great number of those who attend UFO symposiums are simply looking
for answers. Some have had experiences that defy ration- al explanation,
such as witnessing strange craft in the air or recurring, otherworldly
dreams. Alien abduction is, without question, the most commonly discussed
topic.</P>

<P>Much of clinical psychologist Dr. Edith Fiore's practice is devoted
to the treatment of people who believe themselves to be victims of extraterrestrial
abduction. A simple poll conducted during a Fiore alien-abduction workshop
reveals that more than half of the audience believes that they have been
abducted by extraterrestrials.</P>

<P>Fiore, who typically induces hypnotism in treatment of such cases, claims
to have treated many people plagued by the trauma. She has compiled the
ten most common signs of alien abduction: 1. Unaccountable periods of missing
time. 2. Persistent nightmares or dreams about flying saucers or extraterrestrials.
3. Sleeping disorders. 4. The sudden appearance of unusual marks on the
body. 5. Awakening with strange bodily sensations, including tingling or
temporary paralysis of the limbs. 6. The feeling of being watched or communicated
with. 7. Repeated sightings of UFOs. 8. Vague recollections of an abduction
experience. 9. The unexplained healing of ailments or diseases. 10. Reacting
with fear or discomfort when looking at pictures of flying saucers or extraterrestrials.
(&quot;One woman wet her pants in a bookstore when she saw the cover of
Whitley Strieber's book Communion,&quot; Fiore notes.)</P>

<P>During her workshop at the International Symposium on UFO research in
Denver, Colorado, Fiore stresses that such symp- toms don't necessarily
mean one has been abducted by aliens; but anyone with persistent doubts
might want to consider a hypnotic regression for a more conclusive answer-and
after saying this, she produces her business cards.</P>

<P>Phenomena researcher Linda Moulton Howe, author of An Alien Harvest:
Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien
Life Forms, recalls the bizarre case of a Georgia man named David Huggins
who was seduced by a beautiful, female alien and used as a walking sperm
bank.</P>

<P>According to Howe, Huggins met his alien lover when extra- terrestrials
led him aboard their craft. Later, an alien appeared in his apartment and
asked him to use his body. Huggins said yes, and pretty soon found himself
having sex with the alien woman on a regular basis.</P>

<P>Most times, Huggins would be awakened in the middle of the night to
find himself paralyzed in bed, a raging hard-on tenting his sheets. While
a strange mantis-like creature watched from a discreet distance, the alien
woman appeared, mounted Huggins until he climaxed, after which she usually
climbed off and disappeared.</P>

<P>One night, the alien woman appeared to Huggins with a hybrid baby in
her arms-the apparent result of having mated with the fertile Georgia man.
The woman told Huggins that the baby was dying. Suddenly Huggins found
himself aboard her spacecraft. He touched the baby and felt an odd jolt
of static electricity.</P>

<P>The baby immediately exhibited signs of reviving. The aliens became
very excited about this. They took Huggins to a nursery where hundreds
of hybrid babies were being kept in tiny incu- bators. The aliens told
Huggins that all of the babies were his, and asked him to give each a life-saving
touch.</P>

<P>The next morning, Howe relates, Huggins became angry at being used by
the aliens simply as a sperm bank. He masturbated three or four times that
day so they wouldn't have anything to take the next time they dropped in.
But an understanding was finally reached, and the climactic close encounters
continued until reaching at least, a more amenable conclusion.</P>

<P>Huggins who grew emotionally attached to his extraterrestrial lover,
is unlike most other abductees in that he didn't need hypnosis to figure
out what had happened. Instead, Howe reveals, vivid memories of his erotic
experience came flooding back while reading abduction specialist Budd Hopkins's
book Intruders-espe- cially the seventh chapter, which deals with another
man who reported similar sperm-retrieval methods utilized on his behalf
by alien visitors.</P>

<P>* * *</P>

<P>UFO buffs appear to be, by nature, an open-minded lot, but there's one
thing they adamantly refuse to tolerate:debunking. Attendees know what
they know-or have seen or experienced-and they aren't interested in being
told that their particular phenomenon might be something else, no matter
how logical alternative explanations may be.</P>

<P>Cynics in any New Age alien conference audience quickly learn that the
majority of their fellow attendees are fervent devotees of the latest,
hot abduction story or conspiracy theories, regardless of absurdity or
lack of proof. A negative observation is almost always met with an equally
earnest re- buttal supporting the veracity of the disputed situation, in
part or entirely because: *A noted researcher said so. *The person telling
the story would have nothing to gain by lying. *A skeptical analysis of
the alleged facts would merely contribute to the government's ongoing disinformation
campaign to discredit reputable UFO research.</P>

<P>One of the most hated figures in UFOology is Philip Klass, an aviation
journalist and author of several books debunking the UFO phenomenon.</P>

<P>Klass's reputation within the UFO community is well deserved- he pulls
no punches. In his 1983 book, UFOs: The Public Deceived, for example, he
notes: &quot;One possible explanation for the mush- rooming number of abduction
cases in recent years is that (the UFOers) are growing bolder.... The alternative
explanations that people have discovered how easy it is to fool famous
UFOologists with tall tales and to become instant international celebrities
via the pages of sensationalist tabloid newspapers.&quot;</P>

<P>One would think that the UFO community would embrace people like Klass
on the merit that a skeptical eye helps maintain objectivity. Instead,
prominent UFOologists spend considerable time, especially before an audience,
flogging Klass's research in the zealot's belief that skeptics do more
harm than good.</P>

<P>The 1992 International Symposium on UFO Research is no exception. Daniel
Drasin, a writer and long-time UFO researcher, offers a somewhat tongue-in-cheek
view of the situation in a humorous lecture titled &quot;How To Debunk
Just About Anything.&quot; In his talk, Drasin outlines in careful detail
how the debunkers and skeptics of the world go about the task of downplaying
or explaining away every new finding in the UFO field. Not unexpectedly,
his vicious tweak of Philip Klass gets one of the biggest laughs of all,
as eyes once more turn to the inexplicable to explain all.</P>

<P>TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF</P>

<P>Urgent News:</P>

<P>FBI DIRECTOR LAUNCHES POLICE STATE AGENDA AGAINST LAW-ABIDING GUN OWNERS.</P>

<P>For the first time in its history, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
has marched into politics to attack law-abiding gun owners by recommending
radical gun control laws. This attack could spell disaster for civil rights
and the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. FBI Director William
Sessions has officially recommended that the Justice Department endorse
a wide range of gun control proposals, including:</P>

<P>* Mandatory licensing of all handgun owners. * A ban on the manufacture,
transport and possession of semiautomatic firearms, with no compensation
for current owners. * A ban on high-performance ammunition commonly used
for hunting and self-defense. * Taxpayer-funded handgun buy-back programs
within an amnesty period. * Passage off the Brady bill &quot;national waiting
period.&quot; * Reallocation of FBI resources to increase regulation of
federally licensed firearm dealers.</P>

<P>It is the position of the National Rifle Association that this unprecedented
action is beyond the purview of the FBI, repugnant to American freedoms,
and an ominous sign of police state tactics against law-abiding gun owners.
Since the FBI was founded in response to government corruption there has
been widespread concern that the Bureau might become a potent political
police force. Recognizing that danger, the FBI acknowledged it should &quot;remain
apart from politics&quot; because engaging in political debate &quot;would
destroy the confidence of the Executive Branch, the Congress and the American
people.&quot; The Above quotation was taken directly from the FBI's June
11, 1993 manifesto outlining the &quot;FBI's Gun Control Policy.&quot;
The hypocrisy is obvious. On one hand, the FBI claims it must avoid partisan
politics to keep the confidence and trust of the American people. But Director
Sessions has ignored this critical principle and chosen to thrust the FBI
into the fray of one of the hottest political issues of the day. Even more
incredibly, the same document recommends that the FBI's Office of Public
and Congressional Affairs &quot;develop a media strategy to publicize and
develop support for the FBI's position.&quot; This directive defies federal
law Sec. 1913, Title 18, U.S.C., which prohibits the use of congressionally
appropriated funds for the purposes of lobbying. The entire BIll of Rights
was born of fear of the federal government infringing on the individual
rights of law-abiding citizens. This is precisely the course now being
pursued by William Sessions. Unless he is brought under control, Sessions'
policies will lead to a government-driven civil and Second Amendment rights
disaster. It is an insult to the FBI and its agents that their Director
has advanced a political agenda. It is doubly insulting that the justification
for his proposals contain no citations of any evidence or any supporting
criminological research. Glaringly absent is the massive research conducted
on firearms issues funded by the Department of Justice itself-research
which clearly proves gun control laws are a failure in reducing crime.
Implementing Sessions' New York City-style anti-gun schemes will cost millions
of taxpayer dollars, restrict the rights of honest people to defend themselves
against violent predators, and could trigger an epidemic of infringement
upon civil liberties protected by the U.S. Constitution. This amounts to
nothing short of an attack by a federal police force on the rights exercised
in half the households in the country. In fact, the June 11 FBI document
reveals a wish list that included &quot;a general ban on the possession
of handguns&quot; but that &quot;after careful consideration [it was] concluded
that a proposed ban would not receive sufficient support.&quot; So they
settled for mandatory licensing for anyone who wishes to possesses a handgun,
and a handgun buy-back program for those who don't wish to submit to government
licensing or who are denied a license. Whatever the result of Sessions'
recommendations, one thing is certain: Violent criminals will continue
to plague American neighborhoods, unaffected by laws which only the law
abiding obey. What we need from government isn't more restrictions on honest
citizens, but more restrictions on violent criminals. And what members
of Congress need is to hear NRA members express their immediate outrage
over WIlliam Sessoins' move to politicize the FBI, and insist that Congress
and the Clinton Administration reject all such restrictive gun laws. Sessions'
vision of the FBI is our Founding Fathers' worst fear: A federal police
force disarming the law-abiding populace.</P>

<P>Talking with Rosie: Home Robot Interfaces</P>

<P>The Average person on the street could not care less about the turing
test, but if you mention a robot that could help around the house, the
level of interest skyrockets. The next questions are where to buy it and
how much it costs. The general public has long been tantalized with Hollywood
images such as Rosie Jetson, R2D2, and Short Circuit and is now waiting
for consumer service robotics to appear in the household section of the
local department store along side vacuum cleaners and dishwashers. Getting&quot;Rosie&quot;
into the American home is not only a mechanical challenge but also a major
litmus test for AI technology. &quot;We are living in a pre-Wright-Brothers
era where home robots don't fly,&quot; says Brad Smallridge, director of
the San Francisco-based Robotics Society of America. &quot;Who will be
the one to put the right combination of mechanical and electronic devices
together? It may be a big company, but I suspect it may also be a garage-type
inventor, possible working in conjunction with a local robot organization.&quot;
Are technology pieces still missing? Six hundred and fifty thousand first-generation,
industrial robots have already proven the ability to outperform humans
in many repetitive tasks requiring advanced skills with high precision
in difficult factory environments. Simulation to alleviate programming,
extended mobility, and augmented reality capabilities are a few of the
reasons why advanced computing will continue to improve first-generation
robots for new manufacturing requirements. On the other hand, the unstructured
nature of the home puts higher demands on robots to interact with humans
and raises the specter of intelligent robotics. The general principle of
&quot;intelligent robotics&quot; was developed by G. Saridis more than
a decade ago in a quest to increase intelligence with decreased precision.
If robots are to assist the handicapped and elderly, befriend the young,
cook, clean, patrol, and perform other tasks, a primary target must be
the development of simple interfaces to intelligent machines. Maybe the
real feasibility of household robots requires something further: machine
intelligence that involves situational awareness and human empathy. We
may just need a fourth law to supplement Asimov's three laws of robotics:
* One: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow
a human being come to harm. * Two: A robot must obey the orders given to
it by human beings, except where such orders conflict with the first law.
* Three: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection
does not conflict with the first or second laws. * Four: A robot must understand
the dynamic environment and offer a helping hand to improve the environment
for the human being (except when in conflict with the three laws). Development
of the previously outlined intelligence capability is probably beyond our
time. However, there is a huge market that would be content with a low-cost,
metallic servant that can hear, understand, effectively perform a limited
set of &quot;dirty work&quot; household chores, and doesn't require social
security tax payments!</P>

<P>MAKING ROOM FOR ROSIE A recent roundtable session at the 1993 Robots
&amp; Vision Automation Conference in Detroit, Mich., was devoted to the
topic of household robots. Joseph Engelberger opened the debate with a
video presentation, prepared by Transitions Research Corp. (TRC) of Danbury,
Conn., showing simulations of bathroom cleaning, car washing, and drink
serving. Other robotic tasks shown were window washing, dishwasher loading,
and hospital courier service. The key concepts included: * Accurate sensory
suites are available today * The broad range of preprogrammed tasks must
not require absolute locations * Tactile feedback must be able to adjust
to the right amount of force. * Interchangeable end-effectors must be able
to match the right tool to the job. * Dynamic scene analysis must accompany
appropriate task nesting. * As long as the robot is ready for the next
assignment, time is a noncritical issue. * They keyboard form of human-machine
interface is not acceptable. * Voice recognition technology is now adequate
for many tasks. * A potentially profitable market exists for household
robots.</P>

<P>The Detroit roundtable debate discussed the national implications of
a program to develop the household robot. Brian Carlisle, president of
the Robotic Industries Association, stated that a business plan was needed
to get this program off the ground. He suggested that direct research funds,
such as those in the Advanced Technology Program at the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST), were needed. Carlisle pointed to the
fact that in Japan 3% of the workforce is robots, compared with United
States, where they only constitute .017% of the workforce. To overcome
such inertia, Carlsile suggested that the United States would need a multibillion
dollar robotics program, which would be analogous in program commitment
to sending someone to the moon. The debate quickly turned to costs. Engelberger
reminded everybody that the first VCR was very costly and that initial
global positioning systems (GPS) cost $25,000, while today a GPS unit costs
less than $25. Engelberger speculated that the first household robots would
probably cost about $50,000 and could be included in the mortgage. Engelberger
stated that the current cost of the technology behind &quot;smart houses,&quot;
which are essentially data collection networks of the microchips attached
to everything, is approximately $30,000-$60,000. In promoting home robotics,
Engelberger said that, rather than merely pushing data around, the household
robot would also be capable of pushing things around. James Albus, chief
of the Robot Systems Division at NIST, posed that replacing the neighborhood
kid who cuts the grass for $20, the local drive-through, or $6 car wash
is not practical. However, Albus declared that home robotics could help
reduce the cost of health care. Albus stated that a leading cause for the
elderly giving up the comfort of their own homes for a nursing home, at
an annual cost of approximately $25,000 per person, is hip injury from
falling on the way to the bathroom. If, for example, a home robot could
provide physical assistance for the elderly, and postpone relocation to
a nursing home by merely two years, the robot cost could be covered. Larry
Leifer, director at the Center for Design Research at Stanford University
in Palo ALto, Calif., pointed to the home robot as a solution to reduce
the $84 billion the United States spends annually to care for 80,000 severely
physically or mentally impaired persons: Robots would be able to provide
immediate benefit in such circumstances. William Harwin, director of Rehabilitation
Robotics at the A.I. duPont INstitute in Wilmington, Del, suggested that
people with disabilities are &quot;techno-friendly&quot; and could readily
make the transition to using home robots. James Hwang, project manager
of Automation and Robotics at Johnson NASA, suggested that development
of the house robot could leverage the advanced work in dexterous and mobile
robots and teleoperations at government robotics laboratories. For example,
Hwang suggested that the ability to control robotic tasks from a desktop
has already been developed at NASA. He pointed to the advanced robotics
at numerous universities, including Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, MIT, and
Texas. The roundtable session concluded with different viewpoints regarding
whether home robots should be developed as multipurpose machines or as
basic, single-task units with optional, add-on modules to perform specialized
tasks. It was argued that the economics of providing optional $3,000 modules
(to wash dishes, clean windows, and so on) would entice more customers
to invest in the basic model. Others argued that while the basic &quot;stripped-down&quot;
model may be cheaper to build initially, only the multipurpose robot could
integrate tasks intelligently and provide the necessary flexibility the
consumer market will eventually demand.</P>

<P>MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU Robotics will continue to benefit from the
exploding developments in sensor technology: smart sensors, adaptive architectures,
microlens imaging, and embedded fiber-optic sensors. Intelligence processing
is slowly migrating to the distributed sensors. For example, the aerospace
industry has long been interested in smart structures for applications
in structural dynamics, active vibration control, and aircraft health monitoring.
Likewise, the utility industries are interested in solutions requiring
remote operation and tolerance for harsh environments including radiation.
Surely if robots can clean up Chernobyl, they should be able to clean most
homes. An important principle for home robotic flexibility is force-feedback.
A simple device that demonstrates this principal was recently developed
at Stanford. An operator commands the cutting action of a remote set of
scissor blades (&quot;slave&quot;) through the use of a standard scissors-type
pair of handles (&quot;master&quot;). The intermediate electronics (&quot;control
logic&quot;) take the positional input from the master and direct the slave
to move accordingly while reading the force interaction data from the slave
and furnishing the master with the movements to reproduce the same response:
This gives the operator the sensation of actually cutting an object, even
though no direct physical connection exists. Applications of teleoperation
principles to robotic devices have been successful at A.I. duPont and are
improving manipulator control for people with severe disabilities. Individuals
with spinal cord and other paralyzing injuries may have complete loss of
motor and sensory functions that can impair their abilities to interact
with the environment and perform tasks such as feeding themselves or turning
the pages of a book. To enable these individuals, voice input and visual
feedback provide an electronic interface that approaches the integrity
of a physical linkage. Such research proves that systems that provide proprioceptive
feedback can offer superior control. T. Rahman and W. Harwin suggest that
persons with physical disabilities could use teleoperative methods remotely
to operate robotics devices for tasks such as vacuum cleaning. However,
for people who are seldom at home and want a robot that can automatically
vacuum the house at a convenient time, other issues are involved. The robot
must monitor itself and be able to return to base to recharge batteries
or dispose of trash. The robot must be able to distinguish between a lost
earning and household dirt and recognize task completion. The robot must
be designed so that it does not fall down the stairs, leave the house to
vacuum the lawn, or attempt to vacuum the cat. In recent years, considerable
discussion has surfaced in robotics literature about the automatic acquisition
of skills, while avoiding the high computational costs associated with
sensory processing, planning, and control. For example, J. Gefland discusses
a hybrid architecture of vision and neural nets for teaching a robot to
dribble a basketball. This skill requires the robot to learn to interact
dynamically with an external object at the correct force levels. The robotic
arm dribbles the basketball, and the position of the ball, arm, and obstacles
are sensed. A neural net learns the proper response through kinesthetic
information from the joint angle sensors, and the acquired control laws
compensate for errors in joint locations and velocities. The ball-dribbling
skill cannot be preprogrammed. Replacing human manipulation with electromechanical
analogues also introduces another significant challenge-the issue of safety
and the Asimov laws. Consider the recent successful application of robotics
to the orthopedic procedure of total hip replacement by the ROBODOC surgical
assistant, from Integrated Surgical Systems INc. of Sacramento, Calif.
With a human surgeon present, ROBODOC machines a cavity in the patient's
femur bone before the prosthetic implant is inserted. This procedure requires
a person-machine interface that is powerful and easy to use by individuals
who are not roboticists. In industry, gates, pressure-sensitive mats, flashing
lights, cages, and other devices keep people out of the robot workspace.
Since the surgical staff and the patient must be inside the ROBODOC work
envelope, a safety subsystem must ensure that people are not harmed in
the event of a robotic malfunction. ROBODOC has an independent safety hardware
processor with a direct interface to a second set of position encoders,
force sensors, and motion monitors for detection of potential collisions,
task failures, or other inconsistencies. Resolution of safety concerns
is critical. The household robot is envisioned as a general factor: part
butler, cook, maid, bodyguard, and grounds keeper. This list of roles demonstrates
that the heavy-handed approach in industry of isolating the robot is not
acceptable in home application. Electronic auras around robots could be
used to prevent robot movement whenever a human enters a robot's territory
or vice versa. Meanwhile, household robotics must continue to meet Asimov's
criteria. SAY IT AGAIN, SAM Humans should not have to agonize over making
their wants known. The robot must be able to recognize and understand the
spoken word, and, using voice synthesis, it must respond as situations
demand. This interface requirement is within current voice recognition
and speech synthesis capabilities. Consider the speech-activated manipulator
(SAM), the research tool developed over the last decade at AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J. SAM has been used in the study of robotics
in which executing complex tasks without requiring detailed programming
instruction is necessary. SAM is a 450-pound, six-axis arm equipped with
advanced sensory capabilities and can interact with a human via spoken
language-thus simulating a certain level of intelligence. According to
M. Brown, speech recognition has been augmented in SAM with semantic evaluation
to form a natural language understanding system that makes it easy to use,
without requiring that the user know about robots, computers, or programming.
SAM is connected to a knowledge base, which makes it more resistant to
user errors. SAM uses minimal descriptions thus, the user is spared the
tedium of listening to protracted descriptions every time SAM references
an object. SAM obtains information interactively from the user while attempting
to complete a command task. For example, a human may request that the robot
move an object that has been given an ambiguous object description, prompting
SAM to ask questions to resolve ambiguity. In other situations SAM can
resolve knowledge or task inconsistencies by initiating dialogue. One escape
is always provided for the user-the choice to stop SAM's line of questioning
at any time by telling it to &quot;ignore.&quot; Since semantic knowledge
is obtained by SAM through dialogue and direct teaching, much depends on
correct responses from the user. Brown suggests that this may be the weakest
part of the system; that is, if the user misleads SAM about the meaning
of words, SAM has no way of knowing or correcting the error. Future access
to commonsense reasoning, via access to the CYC-type, large knowledge bases,
could provide more robust interface solutions. SPEECH REVUE In the earliest
speech recognition developments, systems recognized isolated words (words
typically separated by about 1/4 second) from a small vocabulary (less
than 100 words) uttered by a specific speaker (&quot;speaker dependent&quot;).
Such systems worked by storing normalized templates of known words, which
had been spoken by each speaker. The incoming speech signals were split
easily into word segments because silence delimited the word segments.
The word segments then were normalized and matched against word templates,
using dynamic time-warping methods. This technique worked well for the
well constrained problem. However, once any of the constraints were relaxed,
this technique ran into serious problems. Such systems had to store and
search not only the word templates, but all potential combinations of word
templates. This process was necessary because of coarticulation, where
two speech sounds occurring together could combine to produce a different
sound (such as did you = didja or some milk = somilk). Even for a 50 word,
continuous-speech system, this approach required storing and searching
several thousand templates for each word. This technique proved to be unscalable.
The next generation of speech recognition systems attempted to work with
continuous speech. Word templates were scrapped, and an attempt was made
to understand the whole by understanding the parts. Word segments were
broken into word syllables, or atomic speech units, called phonemes. For
example, the word &quot;Rosie&quot; would be represented as &quot;r ow
jh iy.&quot; In this process, speech units were identified, and dictionaries
of words were build from these basic units. This approach constrained the
search over a finite and relatively small number of phonemes, since coarticulation
effects between phonemes could be accounted for by phonological rules.
While systems using this technique cleared the scalability hurdle, other
problems were created * Segmentation: Deciding where a segment starts and
where it ends is very difficult because there is no clear, well-established
delimiter between phonemes. Most systems resolve this problem by using
heuristic rules. * Labeling: Assigning a phoneme name to a segment is questionable
because phonemes come in various sizes and shapes, and distinguishing them
in nonrivial. Multiple labels with corresponding matching scores are often
assigned to a segment. Some systems, such as Dragon, use a segment-level
word-dictionary instead of labels. * Word Matching: The sets of labels
and matching scores from the incoming stream must be quickly mapped to
words, while retaining the ability to backtrack and pick the next-best
candidate word if the first choice is found incorrect. A majority of speech
recognition systems now use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) network- a probabilistic
finite-state automation method for mapping label sets to words. These problems
and others, including noise, unexpected starts or stops, corrections, and
grammatically incorrect utterances have restricted speech technology from
recognizing real-life, natural speech utterances from multiple speakers
in real time with high accuracy. The interface requirement to recognize
every word of speech rather than sentence recognition may need to be relaxed
to understand essential robotic commands. High-speed computing advances
and parallel processing will contribute significantly toward improving
recognition accuracy. Hybrid approaches (using neural networks as a first
stage classifer and distance computation unit for local frames, dynamic
time warping to compute normalized distances over frame-sequences, and
then to select the best match) hold great promise. For example, neural
nets were applied at duPont to characterize nonvocabulary utterances in
disordered speech. The disordered speech that results from timing problems
associated with dysarthria (cerebral palsy) is difficult to recognize because
it often involves periods of extraneous silence or non-speech sounds, as
well as abnormally timed or misplaced speech gestures. S. Peters used a
neural net to detect the presence of inappropriate or nonspeech sounds,
and a conjugate gradient algorithm was used to train the system to recognize
breaths and silence in a single dysarthic speaker. Further research is
necessary to achieve robust systems that can provide adequate voice recognition
performance in the presence of speech variability and noise. This includes
the problem of speakers under stress or with altered voices, such as those
induced by a cold. Another research area is prosodics, the features in
human speech involving emotion, intention, or emphasis. Prosodic information
can be detected from changes in intonation, tonality, vowel duration, pitch,
and volume. Applications that could benefit from such research include
airborne pilot assistance, airline baggage handling and railway ticketing
systems, voice-activated assembly, stock market transactions, and, of course,
household intelligent robotics.</P>

<P>ROBOTS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS Effective robot interaction demands two-way
communication, as we saw with SAM. Speech synthesis capability has been
available for many years and is much less complex in implementation than
voice recognition. Common metrics for speech synthesis are intelligibility
(the degree to which a listener can correctly understand the output) and
naturalness (the degree to which speech sounds human, not like a machine).
Current speech synthesis systems provide a &quot;faceless&quot; voice-a
generic voice rather than a personalized voice. For Rosie to be acceptable
in many households, it would be desirable to have a distinct, personalized
voice complete with localized accents and colloquialisms. Most speech systems
combine phonemes to produce speech. Such systems can effectively produce
unlimited speech, but the quality of speech is very poor because most do
not account for the coarticulation. Speech systems that combine large units
of words can produce excellent-quality speech, but there are severe limitations
in storage and retrieval. An intermediate approach-combining intermediate
size units such as diphones-to produce fair-quality speech with a substantial
vocabulary would probably be acceptable for robots. The number of commercial
products for speech recognition and synthesis is increasing. Apple Computer
developed the Casper voice-activated interface, IBM introduced numerous
voice technology products this year, and Northern Telecom has developed
a Flexible Vocabulary Recognition system to recognize thousands of words
over noise phone lines. New &quot;command-and-control&quot; products are
appearing on the market for improved VCR programming, automated teller
machine security, and speech translation. If such capability is entering
the living room with the TV and the phone, how long will it be before the
same technology can be integrated into a household robot? A &quot;home
robot standard&quot; would help define the voice interface. This might
include restricted domain models and language vocabularies, defined noise
thresholds, and limitations on continuous speech and speaker independence.
Easy integration of standardized voice interface components will let household
robotics integrators concentrate again on the intelligent tasking requirements.</P>

<P>A FEW GOOD ROBOTS Some service robots are already hard at work. For
example, HelpMate, TRC's mobile robotic courier product, designed to perform
material transport tasks, is employed in a dozen hospitals across the country.
The robots work around the clock, delivering meals, pharmaceuticals, medical
records, and lab results to nursing units. By assuming the time-consuming
&quot;go-fer&quot; tasks, the HelpMates free up hospital staff for more
important, direct patient-care duties. The health care industry is not
alone in successfully applying mobile-robot technology. Other service industry
applications include security and patrol, commercial floor care, hazardous
waste handling, bomb disposal, nuclear plant clean-up, janitorial services,
rehabilitation programs, and the military. A clearinghouse for information
on service robotics is the National Service Robot Association of Ann Arbor,
Mich. Let's look at some of the household robot design requirements (remembering
that the robot must function in an environment designed primarily for human
comfort and convenience). The household robot must: * Be able to navigate
throughout the house. Humans can be made very comfortable in surroundings
amenable to the wheeled locomotion necessary for robots; that is, homes
that are modified for wheelchairs. *Be able to locate in designated work
zones. The robot memory will contain a map of all regions to be visited,
and sensory perception will continuously analyze to the current location:
This is analogous to the maps posted strategically in theme parks and museums
that tell visitors, &quot;You are here.&quot; The robot's memory tells
it not only where it is but also where everything else is, of should be,
located. * Be robust, with smooth joint servos and load-bearing capabilities
appropriate for the job. End-effectors will be equipped with quick disconnect
wrists so that general purpose hands can be selectively replaced by special
purpose tools. Tactile sensing will be of two types: With its finger tips,
it will recognize shapes and grasping postures, and with its wrists, it
will recognize what is in hand and optimized interaction forces and torques.
*Have few speed requirements. Most industrial robots are bound to the assembly
line where production rates are directly proportional to robot arm point-to-point
speed. Meanwhile, the built-in servant has 24 hours a day and seven days
a week to get the job done. Some work is scheduled, such as meal preparation,
but much can be done at night or a time when humans are not at home. Expensive
global optimization computer calculations would rarely have to be run for
performance improvement. * Have vision and other sensory perception, to
see, recognize, and understand. The robot needs vision for navigation and
modest scene analysis and object location capabilities. Because the environment
will be intimately known, the vision requirements do not need to exceed
the current state-of-the-art. Enhancements in the next decade will reduce
the cost of vision components.</P>

<P>THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME Each household has a peculiar set of requirements.
Domestic robots will have a unique definition of setup and run-time parameters,
corresponding to the particular home. This requires a unique information
interface that stat with global task descriptions, develop into the robot
programs, and are tested in simulation. Simulation has shown significant
savings in cost and schedule for industrial robotic applications such as
welding, painting, and assembly. Simulation lets developers quickly and
easily model robot environments to optimize robot kinematics off-line before
running them on the shop floor. Robots can then be calibrated to the tasks,
routines sequenced, collisions detected, and exception handling defined.
This can reduce programmer requirements and disruptions due to error. The
architecture for such simulation is described by R. Bernhardt for a system
called ROSI (Robot Simulation). A similar approach could be used before
bringing Rosie into a home. They layout of the particular home environment
and task expectations would be available through databases and knowledge
bases. Simulation then could be used to define tasks, tine-tune parameters,
and identify potential problems. Eventually, simulation capability should
be automatically available to Rosie and transparent to the human user.
The &quot;Rosie the Maid&quot; character, created in the early 1960's for
the Jetsons cartoon series, was definitely fictional. However, with today's
advanced computing technologies and new research in robotics, sensors,
interfaces, and so on, the &quot;intelligent&quot; home robot will become
a reality. This venture seems like a reasonable challenge for AI technologies;
however, we should probably not say that too loudly, or the general public
will start beating down our doors.</P>

<P>TYPED BY CoB/\LT! America's Invisible Ship. If on a certain night the
moon were full off the California coast, and you could somehow infiltrate
the encircling picket line of military vessels to get within a few hundred
yards of the right spot,you might see with your naked eye what you could
see no other way. Disgorged from a hulking, barge-like mothership, a thin,
prismatic shadow glides silently out onto the shining water like a splinter
of obsidian. It is a ship of some kind, but there is something baffling
about its shape. As it slowly turns to head for open water, its faceted
surface presents the silou- ette of a different object with every few degrees
of rotation. One moment, it is long, sloping trapezoid, then it foreshortens
into a jumbled gemstone, then it resolves into a truncated letter A standing
upright on the water. If you happened to have with you a battery of sonar,
radar and infrared sensors, they would have told you that what you were
seeing wasn't there at all. Out of the black.. Until Friday, April 9, of
this year, the U.S. Navy would have told you the same thing. The vessel
is the Sea Shadow, Americas only known attempt to dis- appear as effectively
on water as the F-117 Stealth fighter can disappear in air. Construction
took place in total secrecy nearly a decade ago at the lock- heed Missiles
and Space Co.'s closely guarded Redwood city, California, facility. As
one of the Defense Department's &quot;black&quot; programs, the whole $200-million
und- ertaking officially did not exist. That changed this Spring with a
terse, page-long memorandum issued from the Pentagon. The need to conduct
testing during daylight, it said, had forced dis- closure to the program.
Beyond that, the Navy kept a lid on the details. Except for a single &quot;Media
availability&quot; at 8am on Easter morning, reporters' questions met with
brief answers from a script that public affairs officers were forbidden
to stray from. Among the sparse facts made available were these: length-160
ft.,width-70 ft., draft-14 ft., displacement-500 tons. The ships purpose
according to the memo, was &quot;to explore the application of a variety
advanced technologies to surface ships. These technologies involve ship
control, structures, automation, seakeeping and signature control.&quot;
Signature control is just another way of saying Stealth. One look at the
ship confirms that escaping detection was the dominant design concern.
It has been shaped according to the same principles that led to the F-117,
another Lockheed product. &quot;If you put wings on it and cut off the
pont- oons, you could probably fly it.&quot; joked Stan Zimmerman, a veteran
Pentagon wat- cher and editor of the newsletter Navy News &amp; Undersea
Technology. So why did the Navy decide to build a stealth ship? How did
they do it? And what will they do with the capabilities thus gained?</P>

<P>Exocet's impact</P>

<P>Part of the Navy's motivation can be read in the grisly headlines that
have followed the sea skirmishes of the past decade. The radar-guided sea
scimming missile, most notoriously the French Exocet, has shown itself
to be a deadly eq- ualizer, giving the small Navies of the world a way
to draw blood from much larger, better equipped forces. Launched from a
small patrol boat, helicopter, or attack plane, theses missiles close in
on a target at near supersonic speeds, while presenting a radar cross section
the size of a sea bird. They fly so low that they're less than a minute
from impact by the time they pop over the horizon and into view of even
the most powerful radars. Under these circumstances, currently available
countermeasures--chaff decoys, and defense gun and missile systems-- are
far from fullproof. Moreover, with a few hundred pounds of high explosive
aboard, seaskimming missiles pack a tremendous bang for their relatively
few bucks. Although, as was the case with the U.S. frigate Stark, heroic
damage-control measures may prevent a ship from actually sinking--that's
about the best that can be hoped for. &quot;If a ship gets hit by a cruise
missile, I think it's fair to say that their fighting for the day is over,&quot;
says U.S. Navy Capt. John Mc Gillvray, who recently resea- rched stealthship
technology at the Naval War College. He estimates that there are more than
15,000 sea-skimming missiles of one type or another in the hands of more
than 50 Navies in the world. Little wonder, then, that there are times
when a ships commander would like nothing better than simply to disappear.</P>

<P>Mystery Barge</P>

<P>On Nov. 4, 1982, an astute reader of the San Francisco papers might
have been puzzled by a brief item on the impending departure of a tremendous
floating dry- dock from thr Todd Shipyard there. Known as the Hughes Mining
Barge, the 4700- ton vessel was originally built for a secret CIA project
in the early 70's, and had been in mothballs for years. The CIA project,
it has since come out, was an attempt to recover a Soviet nuclear sub that
sank off the coast of Hawaii in 1968. This time, about all a Navy spokesman
would say was, &quot;I can assure you it is not going to be used to go
after a submarine. Inside the Barge is a 180-ft.-long, 70-ft.-high enclosure
covered by an ar- ched roof, where work can be conducted out of sight.
by flooding ballast tanks, operators can sink the interior floor beneath
the level of the surrounding sea- water and float vessels in and out. The
Barge left Todd in the summer of 1983 and arrived at Lockheed Missiles
&amp; Space in Redwood City shortly afterward. Har- dly anyone knew why
until this spring. According to the sketchy history released by the Navy,
construction of the Sea Shadow took place inside the Barge, apparently
between 1983 and '85. Night test were conducted in 1985 and '86, with the
Barge keeping the ship under co- ver for repairs and replenishment during
daylight. The tests were suspended in 1986 and not resumed until this spring,
when the ship was unveiled.</P>

<P>Shaping a shadow..</P>

<P>Although few specifics have been given on the reasoning behind the Sea
Sh- adow's design, its stealthy shape and unusual twin-hull configuration
give clues to the intentions and past experiences of those who built it.
Creating useful shapes with very small radar cross sections is still a
black art, but such shapes do have recognizable trademarks. Sea Shadow
appe- ars to be a product of first-generation stealth technology, which
would ex- plain its resemblance to the F-117. The shapes of both bear the
imprint of a computer program called ECHO 1. Developed by Lockheed in the
mid-1970's, this program was key to the company's success in winning the
F-117 contract. ECHO 1 was a breakthrough because it permitted designers
to predict the radar cross section of a shape before building it. The program
limited opt- ions, however, because it could only analyze shapes made up
of a finite num- ber of 2-dimensional panels. This accounts for the faceted
appearance of ea- rly stealth designs. Since then, more powerful computers
and software have made it possible to create more complex stealth designs
like the B-2 Stealth Bomber. But stealth ships have intended to stick with
the older approach. According to the naval architect Harold Armstrong of
Dowty Signature Management, an English maker of radar absorbing materials,
it's mostly a matter of cost. &quot;Welding toge- ther flat plates is much
easier than anything which is curved,&quot; he points out. </P>

<P>Stealth on stilts..</P>

<P>Of course, stealth at sea requires much more than just reducing a ship's
radar cross section. Sonar and infrared sensors can be equally threatening.
And even if the ship itself could be made completely undetectable, its
wake might still give it away. Modern radars can spot the waves kicked
up by small boats, and the Navy has worried that Russia might be working
on satellite- borne wake sensors that could watch vast expanses of ocean.</P>

<P>INVISIBLE WARSHIP..</P>

<P>The Sea Shadow addresses all of these concerns with a single neat design
stroke. The two thin struts that support its main hull stand on a pair
of submerged, torpedo-like pontoons in what's known as a small water plane
twin hull(SWATH) configuration. SWATH designs have long been known for
exceptional stability in heavy seas, but in the case of the Sea Shadow,ther
are important additional advantages. First, with only the knife-like struts
slicing the waters surface, the wake is reduced to almost nothing. Secondly,
the noisier of the propulsion system can be placed high above the water,
where their difficult to hear with passive sonar. The Navy says Sea Shadow's
propulsion is diesel electric, so the probable layout is one electric motor
in each pontoon, powered by one or more diesel generators up above. Photos
show exhaust venting between the SWATH hull's struts, where the heat would
be masked from infrared sensors. Swath also appears to help in evading
radar because it provides a wide base of support, from which the ship's
sides can slope inward. Normally, a ship's sides are nearly vertical, meeting
the water at close to 90 degrees. This pro- duces a bright radar echo called
a broadside flash, which is easy to home in on. Unfortunately, all those
capability has a price. A look at the Navy's TAGOS-19 SWATH surveillance
ships, which are said to incorporate lessons from the Sea Shadow, illustrates
the tradeoffs. Built to tow sub-hunting sonar arrays at high latitudes,
where punishing seas damage equipment and wear out crews aboard con- ventional
ships, the 3397-long-ton TAGOS-19s are the largest U.S. made SWATH vessels.
According to Joseph McMahon, a naval architect at McDermont Internat- ional
where the vessels are built, the SWATH configuration is well suited to
the TAGOS-19 mission, but suffers weight carrying and calm-water speed
limitations that would be a problem in other roles. Looking at pictures
of the Sea Shadow, McMahon commented on the inward slant, or dihedral,
of the hull struts. This would damp out heaving motions in heavy seas by
creating vertical drag. It also requires a nightmarishly complex stru-
cture. &quot;It's outstanding hydrodynamically. It's awful for the builder,&quot;
says McMahon.</P>

<P>What is it for?..</P>

<P>So in the Sea Shadow the navy has a ship that's stealthy, but difficult
to build, capable of only 13 knots, and unable to carry a heavy weapons
load. It's fair to ask, then what do they want with it&gt; At the very
least, they want information. According to what's been released, Sea Shadow
is strictly a one-off research tool. It's credited, for instance, with
insights that helped reduce the radar cross section of the Arleigh Burke-
class destroyers. But, like several other new warship designs under construction
around the world, the Arleigh Burke is better described as low observable
than as completely stealthy. Arleigh Burke's builders made the ship hard
enough to track that its other countermeasures are more effective, but
couldn't make the performance compromises needed to make it disappear from
radar. That brings us to the question of whether there is a role for a
ship that, like Sea Shadow or the F-117, puts stealth almost above everything
else. Maybe there is. Although critics of the idea point out that with
nuclear submarines the Navy can can already operate undetected at sea,
a stealthy ship would have at least two key advantages.One, it could be
used for air defense of convoys, which subs presently cannot. Two, it could
operate in a number of areas--some of them strategically important--where
the water is to shallow for the subs to get close to shore. The bottom
line is that, given how little we knew of the Sea Shadow until the moment
of its unveiling, there's no telling what other &quot;invisible ships&quot;
the Navy may have lurking at sea.</P>

<P>ARTICLE #6</P>

<P>It's time someone told you the truth about the AIDS cover up! TYPED
BY CoB/\LT!</P>

<P>Whats your fear about Aids? I'll tell you what mine is. It's the fact
that i'm being deceived by the very health authorities that are supposed
to be protecting me. And my fears are entirely justified. There is a coverup;
the authorities are running scared; and there's only one way to fight it;
with the truth!</P>

<P>Dear friend, The person i'm about to introduce to you has literally
lived thr- ough hell to get vital truths about Aids to the people who are
most in danger. Yet, he has been scorned, ignored, betrayed, and viciously
slan- dered by the press, politicians, his own trusted colleagues -- not
to men- tion various special interest groups -- for his heroic stand against
this silent killer. Dr. Strecker submitted paper after paper on his findings
to all the prestigious medical journals in America and in Europe. They
were refused. Later , newspapers turned down paid advertising for The Strecker
Memorandum. Few T.V. or radio stations would allow him to be interviewed.
He also suff- ered the loss of two close associates, including his own
brother, under very questionable and mysterious circumstances -- after
repeated threats of vio- lence. This fine physician is even-handed and
fair in his treatment of the fa- cts. But he is ruthless in the sense that
he will tell all the whole truth... even if it offends some special interests.
And often it has. Dr. Strecker has sworn, to get the truth out no matter
what the cost... and he has paid dearly for it. The fact that you're able
to get this material at all is a miracle. Now, take a look at The Strecker
Memorandum. I can al- most guarantee that, like me, you'll be hopping mad
before you're threw rea- ding.</P>

<P>We'd better move fast, or there will be no tomorrow!!</P>

<P>Are you scared? Good! Because it's time someone told the truth about
Aids. And it's time we started demanding our elected officials to do some-
thing about it. Over a 100,000 Americans have died because they didn't
know the truth about Aids. That's more people than we lost in the entire
Vietnam war! I can't tell you how angry all of this makes me. Millions
and millions are going to die because of the complacency of the very people
we've appoi- nted and elected to protect us from this dread disease. There
is no time to waste; we have no more time. The number of Aids- infected
people is doubling every 12 months -- in some areas even sooner. We must
do something to protect our children and ourselves ... or there will be
no more tomorrow. Urgently, </P>

<P>William Campbell Douglas, MD</P>

<P>Did someone finally go too far fooling around with Mother Nature?</P>

<P>&quot;I will show you how the Aids virus was actually predicted, requested,
created, produced, and developed-- and now threatens the very existence
of mankind--be- cause it works.&quot; --Robert Strecker, MD, PhD</P>

<P>Would scientists design and create a deadly virus on purpose? Could
it really be done? Were two horribly fatal animal viruses somehow combined
to create the worlds most deadly plague to hit mankind--one that may well
deci- mate the population within our lifetimes? Then answer, unfortunately,
is yes. Who did this? Who ordered the creation of a virus that could potentially
destroy mankind? And worse--how did it ever get into humans? That's just
one of the tough questions that Dr. Robert Strecker faces head-on in the
incredible video, The Strecker Memorandum. Was it intentional? Dr. Strecker
says it's entirely possible that the Aids virus was deliberately introduced
into the human population. The international infections of human groups
for scientific study has been well-documented.</P>

<P>Or was it an accidental? The frightening thought of a scientist foo-
ling around with the building blocks of nature is all to real a possi-
bility. Dr Strecker takes you inside the halls of science to reveal just
how possible this is.</P>

<P>That's not even the tip of the iceberg as far as the Aids deception
is concerned.</P>

<P>Dr. Robert Strecker spent five exhausting years studying the Aids virus,
it's origins, methods of transmission, and the devastating effects it has
on the human body. He did not like what he saw. And now he's telling you.</P>

<P>You get a quick, easy lesson in what Aids really is--not what &quot;they&quot;
want you to think it is. And at the end while your still reeling from all
the information, Dr. Strecker holds a riveting Q&amp;A session with several
skeptical colleagues. You will not believe your eyes...but you'd better!</P>

<P>Here's just a sample of what you'll learn in the Strecker Memorandum:</P>

<P>* What Aids really is * How the virus could have been created * How
it replicates * How long it really takes to show up * How it kills * How
it transmits between people * Four reasons it wasn't a green monkey * Why
the govt. doesn't want you to know where and why the virus ori- ginated
* How many viruses there really are--and worse, how many more there will
be * Why a vaccine is literally impossible * Why the cure is much more
likely--and whats standing in the way * Why condoms don't work to stop
infection</P>

<P>And there's much more you'll learn in The Strecker Memorandum. After
you watch The Strecker Memorandum, you'll know more about Aids than 99%
of the doctors in America!</P>

<P>Even if Science wasn't your favorite subject in school, you'll find
this video, not only eye opening--but easy to follow as well.</P>

<P>Dr. Strecker doesn't pull any punches. I've never seen a medical problem
explained in such a clear-cut,easy to understand way. He is a professional
in every sense of the word- and he has no agenda to serve except to explain
and disseminate the truth.</P>

<P>There is so much that we aren't told--intentionally or otherwise- about
what the virus really is, what it does and how it kills. Now, you can know
the scientific truth about this silent killer. And it's vital that you
do understand it. Because ignorance today could have devastating consequences
for you and your loved ones tomorrow.</P>

<P>If you think you are safe because you are not gay or promiscuous, or
even sexually active, then you must watch The Strecker Memorandum very
carefully... over and over again if necessary.</P>

<P>Dr. Robert Strecker practices internal medicine and gastroenterology
in Los Angeles. He is a trained pathologist and holds a Ph.D pharmacology.
Dr. Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were preparing a proposal
for a health main- tenance organization (HMO), and needed to know the long-term
financial effects of insuring the treating of Aids patients. The information
they covered from the beginning was so startling, so hard to believe, that
it would dramatically alter both their lives and lead them on a five-year
quest culminating in the creation of The Strecker Memorandum..</P>

<P>GATEWAY TO A CASHLESS SOCIETY Fund/Barter exchanges TYPED BY CoB/\LT!
</P>

<P>The 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was the first modern Olympiad
to ac- tually turn a tidy profit for the host city--thanks to some shrewd
maneuvering by olympic officials who relied on barter to trade licensing
rights for $116 million worth of goods and services from 30 major corporations.
Today, more than 240,000 businesses, ranging from doctors, lawyers, cate-
rers, dentists, restaurants, accountants, hotels,and building contractors
to household names like Xerox, Pan Am, Ramada Inns, MCDonnel Douglas, Mattel,
and Hilton, conducted $5.9 billion of barter transactions in 1991, according
to the International Reciprocal Trade Association, up from 90,000 firms
doing $2.2 bi- llion worth if swaps a decade earlier. The sluggish economy
is fueling this phenomenal growth because barter can preserve cash and
swell business 10 to 15 percent by using excess services and inventory.
For Fortune 500 corporations,the concept of barter used to be a dirty little
secret because it reeked of unloading unsalable inventories at distress
sale prices. No longer. The cataclysmic shifts in the geopolitical have
changed that, too. Former Eastern Bloc nations simply don't have hard currency.
So companies like Pepsi, eager to capitalize on these untapped markets,
have been unashamedly swapping soft syrup for vodka. Plus the recent development
of a trading network that harnesses the speed of supercomputers may be
the gateway to a cashless so- ciety in the twenty-first century. Barter,
once relegated to the back door of the economic underground, has gone legit.
&quot;Barter wont save a failing business. But it can give ones that are
surviving a real competitive edge, because it allows them to buy retail
with their own wh- olesale cost,&quot; says Stephen Friedland, president
of Los Angeles-based BXI Inter- national, which has more than 12,500 members
and 75 branches. Founded in 1960, BXI was the first modern barter exchange
and is still the largest of the nati- on's estimated 400 trading networks.
Typically, exchanges handle record keeping, expedite the flow of trades,
and promote clients through directories and newsletters. In return, they
take a 10- to 15- percent slice off the top of each trade. All transactions
are now repo- rted to the IRS, so bartering is no longer a convenient tax
dodge. People offer goods and services for &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;dollars&quot;
that can be traded on barter exchanges. And those &quot;trade dollars&quot;
can add up. For example, a gra- phic designer used barter credits for a
$20,000 down payment on a house, and a music teacher went on a photo safari
in Kenya-courtesy of her local barter exch- ange. Last year, New York's
Lexington Hotel acquired a $150,000 computer system in exchange for $300,000
worth of room credits. Since the Lexington always has vacant rooms , it's
only real expense was paying housekeepers to tidy rooms. If you think your
business could benefit from barter, check out the track record of a trade
exchange before you join. Fond out how long the exchange has been around.
Does the network have a directory of its members? Does it offer products
and services you can genuinely? Can you trade leftover inventory or services
for items you would otherwise pay for in cash? A new state-of-the-art software
system, UltraTrade, designed for superco- mputers may ultimately even transform
the way we do business. About 400 midsi- zed companies in Southern California
are already online with UltraTrade. If all major U.S. companies used this
trading system, experts estimate it would generate additional annual sales
of $1.5 trillion. &quot;We're on the edge of som- ething unbelievable,&quot;
says Bob Meyer, editor of BarterNews. &quot;The day you can get anything
you want on this exchange-which would require a critical mass of about
4,000 major companies-this will take off exponentially.&quot; and probably
make the green stuff obsolete.</P>

<P>MACH 25 TRANSPORTER</P>

<P>About the size of a Mercury capsule, Lightcraft is powered by a laser
beams relayed down from satellites orbiting Earth. Mirrors bounce the lasers
to a pulse-jet engine.</P>

<P>Sometime early in 2010, a passenger might take off from Albany, ride
a one person craft into space, and touch down 45 minutes later in Australia-all
without burning an ounce of fossil fuel. Lightcraft, a concept vehicle
designed by engineers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy,
N.Y., will be powered by lasers of microwaves beamed to it from satellites
orbiting Earth. Leik Myrabo, head of the RPI design team working on Lightcraft,
says the vehicle will fill a niche: &quot;Lightcraft will be a cheap, reliable
way to send individuals around the globe or into orbit. Many of the components
of the system were first developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
and we are testing models of the craft and is engine right now.&quot; Myrabo
envisions a Lightcraft perched on its slender tripod landing gear, waiting
for a satellite-based solar power station to come into position. When it
does, it will relay laser or microwave beams under the vehicle, heating
the air within a small area to 30,000 degrees K. At this temperature, molecules
of gases in the air explode, creating a series of blast waves that propels
the craft up through the atmosphere. When the craft reaches Mach 11 (8,000
mph) and 90,000 feet, it will switch to magnetohydrodynamic propulsion.
In the upper atmosphere, the air is too rarefied to detonate, but there
will still be enough propulsive force to creative a shock wave as the craft
zooms upward. Two rings of superconductive magnets and a laser-to-electric-power
converter will accelerate the glowing air plasma behind the shock wave,
blowing it backward to boost the craft to its orbital velocity of Mach
25. The converter uses a small amount of liquid hydrogen-the only fuel
LIghtcraft carries. The RPI team has already tested the liftoff pulse-jet
laser-powered engine at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.
The result: performance equal to the jet engines of 1942. &quot;We need
to bring out thrust-to-power ratios much higher,&quot; admits Myrabo, &quot;but
for the very first test of a new design, we think this shows great promise.&quot;
An unmanned demonstrator could be tested within five years.</P>

<P>OUT OF THE BLACK: SECRET MACH 6 SPY PLANE</P>

<P>Does the U.S. Air Force-or perhaps one of America's intelligence agencies-have
a new secret spy lane in action? A growing body of evidence suggests that
the answer is yes. A startling disclosure came recently when Chris Gibson,
a British oil engineer and highly trained aircraft-spotter, produced a
sketch that captured the shape and size of an unusual aircraft he saw during
daylight hours in August 1989, flying over his drilling rig in the North
Sea. The expert eyewitness' drawing is the keystone that, with other evidence,
provides an understanding of a secret hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft
that is widely rumored to exist, but routinely denied by U.S. officials.
Its nickname Aurora.</P>

<P>Gibson-a former member of the disbanded Royal Observer Corps, a group
of volunteer aircraft spotters was able to estimate the strange airplane's
length and width by comparing it with the known dimensions of the K-135
refueling tanker and two F-111 bombers flying alongside. But it wasn't
until last year, when he came across a magazine illustration of a hypersonic
(faster than Mach 5) aircraft design, that Gibson suddenly made sense of
the sharp triangular silhouette he saw.</P>

<P>Analysts believe that Aurora is an operational spy plane that replaces
the retired Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Like its predecessor, Aurora costs
several million dollars per flight and is send out only on missions where
the plane's sensors can gather vital information unobtainable by satellite
reconnaissance or other means. </P>

<P>It's plausible that Aurora was used to photograph Iraq during Operation
Desert Storm in an attempt to provide tactical intelligence to ground-based
military commanders. Aurora's unique capabilities also equip it for surveillance
of nuclear proliferation. The list of nations of varying political complexions
that covertly possess or are pursuing nuclear arms capabilities includes
India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, and South Africa. Surprise
visits by a reconnaissance aircraft can give intelligence analysts clues-such
as the presence of military trucks at an ostensibly civilian plant-which
wouldn't be left out in the open when a spy satellite is scheduled to make
its pass overhead.</P>

<P>Aurora overflights of Russia have probably not occurred. Such missions
would violate an agreement in place since a Lockheed U-2 spy plane was
show down over the Soviet Union in 1960. It is likely, however, that Aurora
monitors the submarine-building programs of Russia, China, and other nations
from well outside their airspace using side-looking sensors.</P>

<P>Gibson's North Sea sighting completes a puzzle that has obsessed military-aircraft
analysts for several years. Consider the following pieces of evidence hinting
at the existence of something unacknowledged that flies high and fast:</P>

<P>* In February 1990, the Air Force retired its SR-71 spy planes. The
official reason was saving the $200 million to $300 million a year it cost
to operate the fleet of Blackbirds. Reporters were told that the SR-71's
role had been taken over by advanced spy satellites.</P>

<P>* The money saved was less than 7 percent of the approximately $4 billion
the Air Force spends yearly on satellite reconnaissance-mere chicken feed
by Pentagon standards. Keeping the SR-71s in reserve would have provided
cheap insurance against an unlucky string of satellite and rocket failures,
such as the ones that occurred in 1985-86'.</P>

<P>* The Air Force actually discouraged congressional attempts to reverse
this termination of its most glamorous aircraft mission. Never in its history
had the flying service walked away from a manned mission without a fight.</P>

<P>* The pace of activity at the Air Force's top-secret Groom Lake test
site in the Nevada desert has increased dramatically in recent years, suggesting
the presence there of one or more secret aircraft programs. By comparing
recent photos of the base with ones taken in the late 1970s, it's apparent
that several large new buildings were added during the 1980s. Always visible
in the recent pictures are a number of charted Boing 737 airliners that
ferry workers in from other defense-industry towns such as Palmdale, Burbank,
or Edwards in Southern California, or from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.</P>

<P>* Since mid-1991, unexplained sonic booms have periodically rattled
Southern California Officials at the United States Geological Survey, the
agency that monitors earthquake activity, no doubt irked the military with
their public statements that a very fast, high-flying aircraft was causing
the &quot;airquakes&quot; registering on their array of seismographs. </P>

<P>* The Federation of American Scientist, a private Washington, D.C.-based
policy group, issued a report late last year on the likelihood that unacknowledged
military aircraft might exist. The cautious review of unclassified literature
on the subject concluded that several new types of aircraft may indeed
be covertly flying around. </P>

<P>Gibson's sighting now makes it possible to reconstruct the Aurora program's
history. The spy plane was operational, or nearly so, by August 1989, just
before the Air Force parked its SR-71s for the last time. Aurora would
have made its first flight by 1986 at the latest, following a development
effort that was launched in 1981.</P>

<P>This analysis elicited denials by high officials involved in defense
and intelligence matters. Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn asserted that
his sources in the intelligence community told him there was no such aircraft.
&quot;I think they're telling the truth,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>Pete Williams, chief spokesman for the Bush administration's Secretary
of Defense, Dick Cheney, gave a standard answer to a query about Aurora.
&quot;If there were such a program, we wouldn't discuss it.&quot; Williams
explained that Pentagon policy says the same answer &quot;must always be
given&quot; to queries about secret programs-whether or not they actually
exist-to avoid revealing the truth. Donald B. Rice, Bush's Secretary of
the Air Force, stated: &quot;There's no program in the AIr Force, none
anywhere else that I know of. It simply doesn't exist.&quot; To some observers
the stridency of Rice's response was puzzling. Why didn't he simply utter
the usual Pentagon disclaimer?</P>

<P>Black is the adjective most often applied to the hidden world in which
such engineering activities unfold. In a 1985 Pentagon budget document
requesting production funds for 1987, a censor's slip let the line item
&quot;Aurora&quot; appear, grouped with the SR-71 and U-2 programs. Even
if Aurora actually was the project's name at the time, it almost certainly
would have been changed after being thus compromised; &quot;Senior Citizen&quot;
is one new label that has been reported. Rated by the Pentagon as an &quot;unacknowledged
special-access program,&quot; the plane's existence and real name are secret,
and therefore deniable.</P>

<P>Unconfirmed reports of Aurora's existence first surfaced in 1986, and
Popular Science conjectured about the airplane's likely design in the November
1988 issue. Now, fresh reports from secret-airplane hunters like James
Goodall, who heard and felt bone-shaking sounds coming from the Groom Lake
facility late in December, continue to flesh out the picture of Aurora
and the technology that makes it work. Armed with patience and braced for
the occasional confrontation with no-nonsense security patrols, resolute
observers like Goodall trek through the harsh Nevada desert to a mountainside
overlooking desiccated Groom Lake. From several miles away-as close as
they can get without entering off-limits government land-the watchers can
see the large air base with its motley collection of hangars. Some of the
buildings are vast. Yet, like a mirage, the isolated facility with its
six-mile runway doesn't exist-officially, that is. And its non-existence
is longstanding. A 1992 Lockheed Corp. paper on the early days of the U-2
program refers to flight-testing at Groom Lake 35 years ago as having occurred
merely at &quot;a remote location.&quot; For some, monitoring events on
the dry lake bed provides the excitement of pursuing a mystery. Author
and photographer Goodall, who has been chasing classified programs for
almost 30 years, is motivated by enthusiasm for aircraft and a conviction
that he's entitled to know how his taxes are being spent. His earwitness
account indicated that the airplane's propulsion system is unconventional,
to say the least. &quot;We heard Aurora from 18 miles away. The sound is
so intense that you feel it. It was quite something else-a pulsing noise
that you'll never forget.&quot;</P>

<P>Aurora was almost certainly built by Lockheed's fabled Skunk Works,
now called the Lockheed Advanced Development Co. Of all known design organizations,
only the Skunk Works has the proven ability to manage large programs incorporating
breakthrough technology in total secrecy. Analysis of Lockheed's financial
statements makes it possible to estimate Aurora's price tag at abut $1
billion per aircraft. At most, 10 to 20 of the new spy planes have been
built.</P>

<P>A hypersonic prototype paved the way for Aurora. In 1975, Lockheed proposed
a small hypersonic research aircraft that would be launched from the back
of an early version of the SR-71. And a definitive survey of Lockheed aircraft,
published in 1982, stated that the company had already flown a Mach 6 experimental
craft. By the late 1970s the U.S. government probably had two main reasons
for going ahead with Aurora. The first: improved Soviet surface-to-air
missile (SAM) systems posed an increasing threat to the SR-71, which flies
at Mach 3.2 (2,100 mph) and reaches altitudes above 80,000 feet. By 1980,
two potent new Soviet antiaircraft weapons, the SA-10 Grumble and the SA-12
Gladiator/Giant, were under development, Both have a maximum altitude of
about 100,000 feet and feature advanced tracking and guidance systems.</P>

<P>The second reason for building Aurora was that satellites alone are
not the best solution to reconnaissance requirements. While they take superb
pictures, satellites also have inherent limitations. They follow fixed,
predictable orbits, which make their appearance no surprised to a shrewd
adversary. Although earthbound controllers can command satellites to fire
thrusters to adjust their orbits, this ability is strictly limited by a
finite on-board fuel supply. In addition, because it is difficult to supply
the amount of power needed to operate an all-weather radar, most satellites
carry only daylight or low-light cameras.</P>

<P>Although they cost several hundred million dollars apiece, spy satellites
last, on average, only five years before they are dumped into the atmosphere
and replaced. And it is difficult to increase surveillance quickly in a
crisis unless a stockpile of reserve satellites and launchers is kept ready-as
the former Soviet Union once did. Aircraft are much more flexible. They
can be dispatched exactly where and when they are needed, and they can
be fitted with day, night, or bad-weather sensors, depending on conditions
in the target area.</P>

<P>An analysis of Aurora's three-dimensional shape can be extrapolated
from its 75-degree swept triangular outline. The aircraft corresponds almost
exactly in form and size to hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft studied
in the 1970s and 1980s by McDonnel Douglas, according to Paul Czysz, now
a professor of aerospace engineering at St. Louis University. Czysz worked
on hypersonics while at McDonnel Douglas, including the company's proposal
for the National Aerospace Plane program, and is an acknowledged expert
in the field. Efficient hypersonic planes &quot;are basically air-breathing
propulsion systems,&quot; he says.</P>

<P>Like the SR-71, Aurora has a crew of two. Flying it is quite unlike
piloting a conventional aircraft. There is little if any outside view,
because a normally angled windshield causes too much drag and gets too
hot. For these reasons, Aurora may have a retractable windshield used only
for takeoffs and landings; at other times, the windshield would be covered
by a heat shield. Aurora's pilot is really a mission manager, monitoring
the aircraft and its systems and following the course of the flight on
large-format video displays. his or her most important function is to cope
with the unexpected: shifts in upper-atmospheric temperature, weather developments
over the target area or refueling zone, or problems with the plane's mechanical
or electronic systems. The RSO supervises a battery of sensors. The most
important is a synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), a side-looking instrument
that takes a sequence of snapshots of the target as the aircraft moves
and complies them into a single radar image that is as sharp as if it had
been acquired using an antenna hundreds of feet wide. The best SAR images
are classified, but have been described as &quot;near-photographic,&quot;
allowing different types of land vehicles to be easily distinguished from
more than 100 miles away, regardless of clouds or smoke. In clear weather,
Aurora uses daylight and infrared cameras for ultra-detailed work. And
unlike a satellite, the craft can be scheduled to make its reconnaissance
passes at the golden hour for covert imaging: early morning, when the low
sun provides even illumination and long shadows that highlight features
on the ground, before heat-induced haze forms. A phased-array antenna built
into Aurora's upper surface-near the tail end, where aerodynamic heating
is minimal-allows the airplane to transmit real-time or near-real-time
imagery to the Pentagon's satellite network.</P>

<P>Aurora uses ramjet engines, because no other type can work as efficiently
at the speeds the plane travels. in its simplest form, a ramjet is a pinched
tube that slows, compresses, and heats the incoming supersonic airstream
before adding fuel to it, producing enormous thrust from the hot gas expanding
out the exhaust nozzle. However, the compression process also generates
tremendous drag. The ramjet designer's challenge is to keep the level of
drag from canceling out the slim margin of thrust that propels the aircraft.</P>

<P>One way to make a ramjet engine efficient is to stretch it along the
entire length of the vehicle. In a hypersonic ramjet aircraft, the underside
of the forward body is a ramp that initially compresses the air before
it enters the inlet ducts, and the curved underside of the afterbody guides
the expansion of the exhaust gas.</P>

<P>IT'S A LIFTING BODY</P>

<P>The compressed air underneath the body serves a second purpose: It holds
the airplane up. At Mach 6, conventional wings would be superfluous appendages
creating horrendous drag. Accordingly, the tips of Aurora's delta platform
are mainly there to provide stability and control. The basic problem with
ramjets is that they don't work at all unless the aircraft is moving quite
fast, and they are not very efficient at speeds less than Mach 2.5. Therefore,
Aurora needs some other system to reach this speed.</P>

<P>There are two clues to the way Aurora's designers solved the low-speed
propulsion problem. The team for the X-30/National Aerospace Plane (NASP),
though tight-lipped about the &quot;accelerator&quot; portion of the NASP
engine design, has indicated that it functions as a ducted rocket in parts
of its operating cycle. The second clue is that Aurora has been associated
with two unusual noises: very-low-frequency pulsing sounds and an extremely
loud roar on takeoff.</P>

<P>ROCKET-ASSISTED RAMJETS</P>

<P>The surging or pulsing sound is associated with a class of standstill-to-hypersonic
&quot;combined-cycle&quot; propulsion systems invented in the late 1950s
and shrouded since then by obscurity rather than security (see The Combined-Cycle
Ramjet Engine). Czysz, who studied combined-cycle engines for hypersonic
aircraft while at McDonnell Douglas, say that their performance is remarkable.
&quot;they go like scalded rabbits,&quot; he says. According to Dr. Fred
Billig at the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University, who
experimented with the combined-cycle engine in the 1960s, one of the attractive
features of this engine is that it delivers high thrust per unit of frontal
area, a drag-reducing characteristic helpful in pushing efficiently past
the sound barrier. Most important, the combined-cycle engine can recover
energy that most engines throw away. by using cold fuel to cool the airplane's
structure and engines, for example, the system converts heat into mechanical
energy used to supercharge the ramjet and generate additional thrust.</P>

<P>SUPER-COLD FUEL </P>

<P>Even though Aurora is 80 to 90 feet long, which is about 20 feet shorter
than the SR-71, it could weigh more-as much as 170,000 pounds when fully
loaded. A clear two-thirds of its total mass would be fuel. Choosing the
right fuel was crucial to Aurora's design. Because various sections of
the craft will reach cruising-speed temperatures ranging form 1,000 degrees
F to more than 1,400 degrees F, its fuel must both provide energy for the
engines and extract destructive heat from the airplane's structures. This
is done on the SR-71, but at hypersonic speeds even an exotic kerosene,
such as the special high-flashpoint JP-7 fuel used by the Blackbird, cannot
absorb enough heat. The solution for Aurora is a cryogenic fuel-a cold
liquefied gas.</P>

<P>The best candidates identified so far are methane and hydrogen. Liquid
hydrogen provides more than twice as much energy and absorbs six times
more hear per pound than any other fuel. The snag is its low density, which
means bigger fuel tanks, a larger airframe, and more drag. While liquid
hydrogen is the fuel of choice for a spacelaunch vehicle that accelerates
quickly out of the atmosphere, studies have shown that liquid methane is
better for an aircraft cruising at Mach 5 to Mach 7.</P>

<P>Methane (natural gas) is widely available, provides more energy than
jet fuels, and can absorb five times as much heat as kerosene. Compared
with liquid hydrogen, it is three times denser and easier to handle-inflight
refueling has been studied and poses no problems. Aurora can fly at subsonic
speeds because its entire body, which has a great deal of area, is a lifting
surface. Also, its sharply swept leading edge-like the Concorde's wing-generates
a powerful vortex at nose-high flight angels, which clings to the leading
edge and boost the body's lift. Unencumbered by aerodynamic freeloaders
such as a conventional fuselage, Aurora's shape is structurally efficient.
It packs a lot of fuel and useful equipment into a relative small volume
that saves weight and minimizes friction drag.</P>

<P>The spy plane's airframe may incorporate some stealth technology, but
it hardly needs it. Hypersonic aircraft are actually much harder to shoot
down than a ballistic missile. Although a hypersonic plane isn't very maneuverable
in the traditional sense, its velocity is such that, within tens of seconds,
even a gentle turns puts it miles away from a SAM's projected interception
point. So why bother with stealth?</P>

<P>FLYING IN THE GOVERNMENT'S BLACK WORLD</P>

<P>The Pentagon's &quot;black world&quot; isn't a mirror-military running
parallel to the familiar one. Rather, it is a submerged network of covert
activities distributed throughout the armed services and other agencies.
It size can be gauged from unclassified Pentagon budget documents, which
include accurate total figures but conceal individual black programs by
labeling them with code names or burying them within other categories.</P>

<P>This hidden ocean of funds for research, development, and production
of secret equipment amounts to $16 billion of the Pentagon's $254 billion
1993 budget. When operations costs are included, the black budget's estimated
annual total comes to a staggering $35 billion.</P>

<P>New construction at the Air Force's secret Groom Lake test facility
in Nevada, and the number or workers being flown to and from there in recent
years, suggests that a decent chunk of this invisible money is being directed
toward several unacknowledged, large-scale aircraft or missile projects
under way at the remote site.</P>

<P>The Air Force has hidden major aircraft programs before on two occasions.
A giant Lockheed airplane called the CL-400 was the U-2 spy plane's intended
replacement Code-named Suntan, the Mach 2.5 aircraft was to be powered
by radical hydrogen fueled engines.</P>

<P>Lockheed had virtually completed the first four aircraft before Suntan
was canceled in 1958 due to technical snags. The project cost $250 million
in fat 1950's dollars. Not one word leaked out about Suntan until 20 years
later, when Lockheed started talking about liquid hydrogen as a future
aircraft fuel.</P>

<P>Suntan was replaced by a CIA project for a Mach 3 spy plane called Oxcart.
After Lockheed was selected to build the plane, it was renamed the A-12.
It first flew in April 196 from Groom Lake, which was made into a fully
equipped base supporting A-12 flight testing and the CIA's dozen operational
planes.</P>

<P>The Air Force subsequently ordered 30 SR-71 reconnaissance-strike aircraft
derived from the A-12 prototype. The existence of the SR-71 was disclosed
in a 1964 statement by President Lyndon Johnson. But the CIA's A-12s flew
secretly until mid-1968, and they were not revealed to the public until
1982. Through a combination of tight security and disinformation, the A-12
program was concealed for 23 years. Now ask yourself: Would your government
lie to you?</P>

<P>In &quot;Mystery Aircraft&quot; a report released last year, the Washington,
D.C. based Federation of American Scientists (FAS) concluded that two or
more types of secret airplanes are likely to exist. Bases on an extensive
analysis of unclassified Pentagon and corporate financial documents, technical
papers, and a range or news reports, the study favors the view that some
of the reported aircraft are prototypes, while at least one may be in regular
service.</P>

<P>&quot;It is probable that at least one high-speed, high-altitude experimental
air vehicle is currently undergoing flight tests,&quot; or may possibly
have achieved operational statue, the report states. The craft could manned
or unmanned, it notes, fitting either the general description of a Mach-4
to Mach-6 Aurora or a faster Mach-8 &quot;exotic propulsion aircraft&quot;
using pulse-detonation or external-combustion technology to reach hypersonic
cruise speed. </P>

<P>The &quot;doughnuts on a rope&quot; exhaust contrail photographed last
year in Texas might be the product of a pulse-detonation type of engine,
which combusts its fuel in intermittent bursts. An aircraft using external
combustion at high speeds would fit the description of a vehicle dubbed
&quot;The Pumpkin Seed&quot;. According to the FAS study, &quot;there is
also the possibility that the possibility that SR-71 follows is hidden
in plain&quot; within the National Aerospace Plane (NASP-also known as
the X-30) project, which is aimed at developing an air-breathing hypersonic
craft that can climb into low-Earth orbit from a runway in a single stage.
Knowledge about propulsion and high-temperature structures gained in the
NASP program may have proven applicable to a Mach 6 to Mach 8 aircraft
now flying.</P>

<P>As many as a few dozen examples of a subsonic stealthy reconnaissance
aircraft called the TR-3A or &quot;Black Manta,&quot; probably built by
Lockheed, may currently be in production or operational, the FAS analysts
say.</P>

<P>Finally, it is highly probable that some one-or two-of-a-kind stealth
aircraft prototypes exist, the study concludes. Such aircraft would be
built to test concepts intended the B-2 bomber, the TR-3A, the Navy's canceled
A-12 stealth attack plane (no relation to the SR-71's predecessor), or
other aircraft. These planes could account for the number of different
mysterious aircraft described in sighting reports.</P>

<P>Putting aside the romance sifting clues about secret airplanes possessing
wondrous characteristics, the authors of the FAS report raise a broader
fundamental question: With the Cold War behind us, what's the effect of
continuing to support such vast and costly secret defense activities?</P>

<P>The hard-nosed answer is provocative: &quot;Secrecy tends to obstruct
technological development by inhibiting communication of useful information,
increasing costs, generating public mistrust, and all too often promoting
fraud and abuse,&quot; the study says. &quot;It is being used to protect
controversial programs from public awareness, more than from hostile intelligence
services.&quot;</P>

<P>Recent major examples of secrecy masking incompetence include the B-2
Stealth bomber program, which has been shot through with cost overruns
and performance shortcomings, and the disgraced Navy A-12 program, which
was killed after billions of dollars of misguided expenditures.</P>

<P>The sentiment expressed by FAS is gathering broad support in Congress
and elsewhere. Its message to the Pentagon is this: Unjustified secrecy
is anti-democratic.</P>

<P>PUMPKIN SEED</P>

<P>Reports of a brightly glowing aircraft moving rapidly across the night
desert sky at high altitudes may be attributed to the use of external combustion.
The exotic hypersonic propulsion method involves igniting fuel released
from ports girdling the plane's flattened, diamond-shaped body. Exhaust
expands in the conical area defined by its shock wave to produce thrust.
Turbojets provide propulsion at low speeds. Here, an exotic propulsion
demonstrator is seen as it transitions from a turbojet-type accelerator
to external-burning powers. In theory, control at high speeds could be
provided by modulating the fuel flow to the propelling nozzles. This aircraft
may be unpiloted.</P>

<P>MOTHERSHIP</P>

<P>Observers in California's Mojave Desert have reported sighting a large
aircraft resembling both the SR-71 and the XB-70, a 1960s Mach 3 bomber
prototype. A flat area atop the plane's aft fuselage appears to server
as a mounting point for an unknown object-hence its nickname, &quot;The
Mother Ship.&quot; Piggyback payloads could include an air-launched satellite
delivery vehicle, an antisatellite weapon, or a high-speed aircraft lacking
a low-speed propulsion system. A vehicle of this kind could operate discreetly
from inland sites, and fly to overwater areas before accelerating to maximum
speed and launching its upper stages into orbit or ultra-high-altitude
flight. Engineers familiar with aircraft structure aerodynamics, and stealth
design assisted in developing the drawing.</P>

<P>TR-3A BLACK MANTA Somewhat bigger and much quieter than the F-117A stealth
attack plane, a stealthy reconnaissance aircraft identified as the TR-3A
may already be in service, according to a report by the Federation of American
Scientists. The subsonic, unarmed Black Manta's likely role would be to
loiter unobserved as far as 100 miles from its target, taking pictures
and conducting electronic eavesdropping. Its mission is similar to that
of the U2-R, a version of the veteran spy plane still in use, but the Black
Manta's likely role would be to loiter unobserved as far as 100 miles from
its target, taking pictures and conducting electronic eavesdropping. Its
mission is similar to that of the U-2R, a version of the veteran spy plane
still in use, but the Black Manta's likely role would be to loiter unobserved
as far as 100 miles from its target, taking pictures and conducting electronic
eavesdropping. Its mission is similar to that that of the U-2R, a version
of the veteran spy plane still in use, but the Black Manta's targets would
probably be unaware of its presence. A small fleet of Mantas (perhaps 20
to 30) may have been produced by Lockheed or Northrop.</P>

<P>ELEVEN THINGS THAT NASA DISCOVERED ABOUT THE MOON THAT YOU NEVER KNEW.</P>

<P>&quot;It seems much easier to explain the nonexistence of the moon than
its existence.&quot; -NASA scientist Dr. Robin Brett</P>

<P>1. The Puzzle of the Moon's Origin: Scientist have generally offered
three major theories to account for the moon in orbit about our planet.
All three are in serious trouble, but the least likely theory emerged from
the Apollo missions as the favorite theory. one theory was that the moon
might have been born alongside the earth out of the same cosmic cloud of
gas dust about 4.6 billion years ago. Another theory was that the moon
was the earth's child, ripped out the Pacific basin, possibly. Evidence
gathered by the Apollo program indicates though that the moon and the earth
differ greatly in composition. Scientists now tend to lean toward the third
theory-that the moon was &quot;captured&quot; by the earth's gravitational
field and locked into orbit ages ago. Opponents of the theory are in doubt,
and none satisfactory. NASA scientist Dr. Robin Brett sums it up best.</P>

<P>2. The Puzzle of the Moon's Age: Incredibly, over 99 percent of the
moon rocks brought back turned out upon analysis to be older than 90 percent
of the oldest rocks that can be found on earth. The first rock that Neil
Armstron picked up after landing on the Sea of Tranquility turned out to
be more than 3.6 billion years old. Other rocks turned out to be even older;
4.3, 4.5, 4.6, and one even alleged to be 5.3 billion years old! The oldest
rocks found on earth are about 3.7 billion years old, and the area that
the moon rocks came from was thought by scientists to be one of the youngest
area of the moon! Based on such evidence, some scientist have concluded
that the moon was formed among the stars long before our sun was born.</P>

<P>3. The Puzzle Of How Moon Soil Could Be Older Than Lunar Rocks: The
mystery of the age of the Moon is even more perplexing when rocks taken
from the Sea of Tranquility were young compared to the soil on which they
rested. Upon analysis, the soil proved to be at least a billion years older.
This would appear impossible, since the soil was presumably the powdered
remains of the rocks, but from somewhere else.</P>

<P>4. The Puzzle of Why the Moon &quot;Rings&quot; like a Hollow Sphere
When a Large Object Hits it: During the Apollo Moon missions, ascent stages
of lunar modules as well as the spent third stages of rockets crashed on
the hard surface of the moon. Each time, these caused the moon, according
to NASA to &quot;ring like a gong or bell.&quot; One one of the Apollo
12 flights, reverberations lasted from nearly an hour to as much as four
hours. NASA is reluctant to suggest that the moon may actually be hollow,
but can otherwise not explain this strange fact.</P>

<P>5. The Puzzle of the Mystifying Maria of the Moon: The dark areas of
the moon are known as maria (seas, as this is what they looked like to
early astronomers-dried-up seas). Some of these maria form the familiar
&quot;man-in-the-moon&quot; and are, strangely, located almost entirely
on one side of the moon. Astronauts found it extremely difficult to drill
into surface of these dark plainlike areas. Soil samples were loaded with
rare metals and elements like titanium, zirconium, yttrium, and beryllium.
This dumbfounded scientists because these elements require tremendous heat,
approximately 4,500 degrees fahrenheit, to melt and fuse with surrounding
rock, as it had.</P>

<P>6. The Puzzle of the Rustproof Iron Found on the Moon: Samples brought
back to earth by both Soviet and American space probes contain pure iron
particles. The Soviets announced that pure iron particles brought back
by the remote controlled lunar probe Zond 20 have not oxidized even after
several years on earth. Pure iron particles that do not rust are unheard
of in the scientific world (although there is a solid iron pillar of unknown
age in New Delhi, India, that has also never rusted, and no one knows why).</P>

<P>7. The Puzzle of the Moon's High Radioactivity: Apparently, the upper
8 miles of the moon's crust are surprisingly radioactive. When Apollo 15
astronauts used thermal equipment, they got unusually high readings, which
indicated that the heat flow near the Apennie Mountains was rather hot.
In fact, one lunar expert confessed: &quot;When we saw that we said, 'My
God, this place is about to melt! The core must be very hot.'&quot; But
that is puzzle. The core is not hot at all, but cold (in fact, as was assumed,
it is a hollow sphere). The amount of radioactive materials on the surface
is not only &quot;embarrassingly high&quot; but, difficult to account for.
Where did all this hot radioactive material (uranium, thorium, and potassium)
come from? And if it came from the interior of the moon (unlikely), how
did it get to the moon's surface?</P>

<P>8. The Puzzle of the Immense Clouds of Water Vapor on the Dry Moon:
The few lunar excursions indicated that the moon was a very dry world.
One lunar expert said that it was &quot;a million times as dry as the Gobi
Desert.&quot; The early Apollo missions did not even find the slightest
trace of water. But after Apollo 15, NASA experts were stunned when a cloud
of water vapor more than 100 square miles in size was detected on the moon's
surface. Red-faced scientists suggested that two tiny tanks, abandoned
on the moon by U.S. astronauts, had somehow ruptured. But the tanks could
not have produced a cloud of such magnitude. Nor would the astronauts'
urine, which had been dumped into the lunar skies, be an answer. The water
vapor appears to have come from the moon's interior, according to NASA.
Mists, clouds and surface changes have allegedly been seen on the moon
over the years by astronomers. For instance, six astronomers in the last
century have claimed to have seem a mist which obscured details in the
floor of the crater Plato. Clouds on the moon are extremely odd, because
the moon's supposed small gravity (one sixth of the earth's, claim many
conventional scientists and NASA) could not hold an atmosphere or have
any clouds on it at all.</P>

<P>9. The Puzzle of the Glassy Surface on the Moon: Lunar explorations
have revealed that much of the moon's surface is covered with a glassy
glaze, which indicates that the moon's surface has been scorched by an
unknown source of intense heat. As one scientist put it, the moon is &quot;paved
with glass.&quot; The experts' analysis shows this did not result from
massive meteor impacts. One explanation forwarded was that an intense solar
flare, of awesome proportions, scorched the moon some 30,000 years or so
ago. Scientists have remarked that the glassy glaze is not unlike that
created by atomic weapons (the high radiation of the moon should also be
considered in light of this theory).</P>

<P>10. The Puzzle of the Moon's Strange Magnetism: Early lunar tests and
studies indicated that the moon had little or no magnetic field. Then lunar
rocks proved upon analysis to be strongly magnetized. This was shocking
to scientists who had always assumed that the rocks had &quot;some very
strange magnetic properties...which were not expected.&quot; NASA can not
explain where this magnetic field came from.</P>

<P>11. The Puzzle of the Mysterious &quot;Mascons&quot; Inside the Moon:
In 1968, tracking data of the lunar orbiters first indicated that massive
concentrations (mascons) existed under the surface of the circular maria.
NASA even reported that the gravitational pull caused by them was so pronounced
that the spacecraft passing overhead dipped slightly and accelerated when
fitting by the circular lunar plains, thus revealing the existence of these
hidden structures, whatever they were. Scientists have calculated that
they are enormous concentrations of dense, heavy matter centered like a
bull's-eye under the circular maria. As one scientist put it, &quot;No
one seems to know quite what to do with them&quot;.</P>

<P>(Reprint of Nikola Tesla's last public work, written shortly before
his death.)</P>

<P>TYPED BY: [MEtONeR]/TRSI</P>

<P>A Machine to End War</P>

<P>By Nikola Tesla As Told To George Sylvester Viereck</P>

<P>Editor's note: Nikola Tesla, now in his seventy-eighth year, has been
called the father of radio, television, power transmission, the induction
motor, and the robot, and the discovery of the cosmic ray. Recently he
has announced a heretofore unknown source of energy present everywhere
in unlimited amounts, and he is now working upon a device which he believes
will make war impracticable.</P>

<P>Tesla and Edison have often been represented as rivals. They were rivals,
to a certain extent, in the battle between the alternating and direct current
in which Tesla championed the former. He won; the great power plants at
Niagara Falls and elsewhere are founded on the Tesla system. Otherwise
the two men were merely opposites. Edison had a genius for practical inventions
immediately applicable. Tesla, whose inventions were far ahead of the time,
aroused antagonisms which del- ayed the fruition of his ideas for years.</P>

<P>However, great physicists like Kelvin and Crookes spoke of his inventions
as marvelous. &quot;Tesla,&quot; said professor A.E. Kennely of Harvard
University when the Edison medal was presented to the inventor, &quot;set
the wheels going round all over the world...What he showed was a revelation
to science and art unto all time..&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Were we,&quot; remarks B.A. Behrend, distinguished author and
eng- ineer, &quot;to seize and to eliminate the results of Mr. Tesla's
work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn, our electric cars and
trains would stop, our towns would be dark, our mills would be dead and
idle.&quot;</P>

<P>Forecasting is perilous. No man can look very far into the future. Progress
and invention evolve in directions other than those anticipated. Such has
been my experience, although I may flatter myself that many of the developments
which I forecast has been verified by events in the first third of the
twentieth century.</P>

<P>It seems that I have always been ahead of my time. I had to wait nineteen
years before Niagra was harnessed by my system, fifteen years before the
basic inventions for wireless which I gave to the world in 1893 were applied
universally. I announced the cosmic ray and my theory of radioactivity
in 1896. One of my most important discoveries - terrestrial resonance -
which is the foundation of wireless power tran- smission and which I announced
in 1899, is not understood even today. Nearly two years after I had flashed
an electric current around the globe, Edison, Steinmetz, Marconi, and others
declared it would not be impossible to transmit even signals across the
Atlantic. Having anticipated so many important developments, it is not
without assurance that I attempt to predict what life is likely to be in
the twenty-first century.</P>

<P>Life is and will ever remain an equation incapable of solution, but
it contains certain known factors. We may definitely say that it is a movement
even if we do not fully understand its nature. Movement implies a body
which is being moved and a force which propels it against resistance. Man,
in large, is a mass urged on by a force. Hence the general laws governing
movement in the realm of mechanics are applicable to humanity.</P>

<P>There are three ways by which the energy which determines human progress
can be increased: First, we may increase the mass. This, in the case of
humanity, would mean the improvement of living conditions, health, eugenic,
etc. Second, we may reduce the frictional forces which impede progress,
such as ignorance, insanity, and religious fanaticism. Third, we may multiply
the energy of the human mass by enchaining the forces of the universe,
like those of the sun, the ocean, the winds and tides.</P>

<P>The first method increases food and well-being. The second tends to
bring peace. The third enhances our ability to work and to achieve. There
can be no progress that is not constantly directed toward increa- sing
well-being, peace, and achievement. Here the mechanistic conception of
life is one with the teaching of Buddha and the Sermon on the Mount.</P>

<P>While I am not a believer in the orthodox sense, I commend religion,
first, because every individual should have some ideal -religious, artistic,
scientific, or humanitarian -to give significance to his life. Second,
because all the great religions contain wise prescriptions relating to
the conduct of life, which hold good now as they did when they were promulgated.</P>

<P>There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of
science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because sci- ence
is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which
never came into being and will never end. The human being is no exception
to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine. Nothing enters
our minds or determines our actions which is not direct- ly or indirectly
a response to stimuli, and from the concordance of our reactions, understand
is born. In the course of ages, mechanisms of infinite complexity are developed,
but what we call &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;, is nothing more
than the sum of the functioning of the body. When this functioning ceases,
the &quot;soul&quot; or the &quot;spirit&quot; ceases likewise.</P>

<P>I expressed these ideas long before behaviorists, led by Pavlov in Russia
and by Watson in the United States, proclaimed their new psychol- ogy.
This apparently mechanistic conception is not antagonistic to an ethical
conception of life. The acceptance by mankind at large of these tenets
will not destroy religious ideas. Today Buddhism and Christianity are the
greatest religions both in number of desciples and in importance. I believe
that the essence of both will be the religion of the human race in the
twenty-first century.</P>

<P>The year 2100 will see eugenics as firmly established. In past ages,
the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less
desirable strains. Then man's new sense of pity began to interfere with
the ruthless workings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep alive
and to breed the unfit. The only method compatible with our notions of
civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization
and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct. Sever- al European
countries and a number of states of the American Union steri- lize the
criminal and insane. This is not sufficient. The trend among eugenists
is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not
a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from
now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person who
is eugenically until than to marry a habitual criminal.</P>

<P>Hygiene, physical culture will be recognized branches of education and
government. The Secretary of Hygiene of Physical Culture will be far more
important in the cabinet of the President of the United States who holds
office in the year 2035 than the Secretary of War. The pollution of our
beaches as exists today around New York City will seem as unthinkable to
our children and grandchildren as life without plumbing seems to us. Our
water supply will be more carefully supervised, and only a lunatic will
drink unsterilized water. More die or grow sick from polluted water than
from coffee, tea, tobacco, and other stimulants. I myself eschew all stimulants.
I also practically abstain from meat. I am convinced that within a century
coffee, tea, and tobacco will no longer in vogue. Alcohol, however, will
still be used. It is not a stimulant but a veritable elixir of life. The
abolition of stimulants will not come about forcibly. It will simply no
longer be fashionable to poison the system with harmful ingredients. Benarr
Macfadden has shown how it is possible to provide palatable food based
upon natural products such as milk, honey, and wheat. I believe that the
food which is served today in his penny restaurants will be the basis of
epicurean meals in the smartest banquet halls of the twenty- first century.
There will be enough wheat and wheat products to feed the entire world,
including the teem millions of China and India, now chronically on the
verge of starvation. The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails,
nitrogen drawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a process
for this purpose in 1900. It was perfected fourteen years later under the
stress of war by German chemists. Long before the next century dawns, systematic
reforestation and the scientific management of natural resources will have
made an end of all devastating droughts, forest fires, and floods. The
universal utilization of water power and its long-distance transmission
will supply every household with cheap power and will dispense with the
necessity or burning fuel. The struggle for existence being lessened, there
should be development along ideal rather than material lines.</P>

<P>Today the most civilized countries spend a maximum of their income on
war and a minimum on education. The twenty-first century will revise this
order. It will be more glorious to fight against ignorance than to die
on the field of battle. The discovery of a new scientific truth will be
more important than the squabbles of diplomats. Even the newspapers of
our own day are beginning to treat scientific discoveries and the creation
of fresh philosophical concepts as news. The newspapers of the twenty-first
century will give a mere &quot;stick&quot; in the back pages to accounts
of crime or political controversies, but will headline of the front pages
the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.</P>

<P>Progress along such lines will be impossible while nations persist in
the savage practice of killing each other off. I inherited from my father,
an erudite man who labored hard for peace, an ineradicable hatred of war.
Like other inventors, I believed at one time that war could be stopped
by making it more destructive. But I found that I was mistaken. I underestimated
man's combative instinct, which it will take more than a century to breed
out. We cannot abolish war by outlawing it. We cannot end it by disarming
the strong. War can be stopped, not by making the strong weak but by making
every nation weak or strong, able to defend itself. Hitherto all devices
that could be used for defense could also be utilized to serve for aggression.
This nullified the value of the improvement for purposes of peace. But
I was fortunate enough to evolve a new idea and to perfect means which
can be used chiefly for defense. If it is adopted, it will revolutionize
the relations between nations. It will make any country, large or small,
impregnable against armies, airplanes, and other means for attack. My invention
requires a large plant, but once it is established it will be possible
to destroy anything, men or machines, approaching within a radius of 200
miles. It will, so to speak, provide a wall of power offering an insuperable
obstacle against any effective aggression. If no country can be attacked
successfully, there can be no purpose in war. My discovery ends the menace
of airplanes or submarines, but it ensures the supremacy of the battleship,
because battleships may be provided with some of the required equipment.
There might still be war at sea, but no warship could successfully attack
the shore line, as the coast equipment will be superior to the armament
of any battleship. I want to state explicitly that this invention of mine
does not contemplate the use of any so-called &quot;death rays.&quot; Rays
are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities
and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance. All the energy of New
York City (approximately two million horsepower) transformed into rays
and projected twenty miles, could not kill a human being, because, according
to a well-known law of physics, it would disperse to such an extent as
to be ineffectual.</P>

<P>My apparatus projects particles which may be relatively large or of
microscopic dimensions, enabling us to convey to a small area at great
distance trillions of times more energy than is possible with rays of any
kind. Many thousands of horsepower can thus be transmitted by a stream
thinner than a hair, so that nothing can resist. This wonderful feature
will make it possible, among other things, to achieve undreamed-of results
in television, for there will be almost no limit to the intensity of illumination,
the size of the picture, or distance of projection. I do not say that there
may not be several destructive wars before the world accepts my gift. I
may not live to see its acceptance. But I am convinced that a century from
now every nation will render itself immune from attack by my device or
by a device based upon a similar principle. At present we suffer from the
derangement of our civilization because we have not yet completely adjusted
ourselves to the machine age. The solution of our problems does not lie
in destroying but in mastering the machine.</P>

<P>Innumerable activities still performed by human hands today will be
performed by automatons. At this very moment scientists working in the
laboratories of American Universities are attempting to create what has
been described as a &quot;thinking machine.&quot; I anticipated this development.</P>

<P>I actually constructed &quot;robots.&quot; Today the robot is an accepted
fact, but the principle has not been pushed far enough. In the twenty-first
century the robot will take the place which slave labor occupied in ancient
civilization. There is no reason at all why most of this should not come
to pass in less than a century, freeing mankind to peruse its higher aspirations.</P>

<P>And unless mankind's attention is too violently diverted by external
wars and internal revolutions, there is no reason why the elec- tric millennium
should not begin in a few decades.</P>

<P>Taken from American Rifleman, October 1993 edition.</P>

<P>TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF</P>

<P>WE WARNED YOU THEY WERE COMING AND THEY'RE HERE</P>

<P>The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. So just repeal
it. NRA warned its members. We tried to warn all Americans. We said the
stakes couldn't be higher, that innocent lives were on the line. And we
said it would be like no other threat. </P>

<P>Today, that threat is crouching at freedom's door, ready to commit the
ultimate crime against the Bill of Rights. For the first time, an anti-gun
White House is in league with anti-gun politicians in Congress. For the
first time, power-hungry federal bureaucrats have ganged up with gun hungry
enemies of the fundamental right to protect ourselves and our families.
And while these enemies of the Constitution stalk our rights and threaten
our values like never before, the media elite cover their tracks. Blinded
by bias and feeding on its hatred for you and other law-abiding gun owners,
the national press cheers on the gun ban movement, reserving greatest praise
for the greatest attack on your rights.</P>

<P>Never before has such raw political muscle been brought to bear in the
biggest power grab in Second Amendment history. And lost in the struggle
are not just patriots who salute the Second Amendment as a pillar of our
democracy, but crime victims-some 1.2 million annually who thwart criminal
attack with privately owned firearms. To these Americans, the Second Amendment
is the right to say &quot;No&quot; to a criminal predator and make it stick.</P>

<P>It's time for America to face the facts: the enemies of the right to
keep and bear arms always had a plan to infringe on the Second Amendment.
Now they've got the power to finish it off.</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: NO DEFENSE AGAINST &quot;THE MAN IN THE SHADOWS&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of
ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles...that we are
unable to think about reality.&quot; When he said this on March 11, 1993
(USA Today), President Bill Clinton was unable to think about the reality
of criminal attack. Sonya Dowdy was and remembering her attack two years
before, remains fixated on her right to defend herself: &quot;I was living
alone. My father bought me a handgun that day and gave it to me that night.
Fifteen minutes later, I was picking up my mail, and there was a man standing
in the shadows.&quot;-Sonya Dowdy</P>

<P>Bill Clinton could not have been clearer in his State of the Union address:
&quot;Send me [the Brady bill], and I'll sure sign it.&quot; And Sarah
Brady could not have been clearer in her statement to the New York Times
(8-15-93): &quot;Without the first step of the Brady bill, we're never
going to get anywhere...Once we get this [the Brady bill], I think it will
become easier to get the laws we need passed.&quot;</P>

<P>And Brady was clear on the laws she thinks you need: &quot;[M]ore thorough
background checks,&quot; the Times disclosed, &quot;including fingerprinting
of purchasers, require safety training for gun buyers and a system of 'needs-based
licensing' with different requirements for hunters, target shooters and
security guards.&quot; Crime victims need not apply for their rights. They
don't even make her list. But to these crimes against the Bill of Rights,
victims themselves can not be clearer: a president who asks them to wait
is a president who asks them to die: &quot;I pulled my gun, and he ran
away. If I had to wait,&quot; Sonya Dowdy said, &quot;I would be dead now.&quot;</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: CRIMINAL OFFENDERS &quot;GET TREATMENT'&quot; 3.2 CITIZENS
&quot;GET LOST&quot;</P>

<P>When crime threatens every American family, Americans demand that the
nation's chief law enforcement officer be a fighter whose aim on criminals
never falters and faith with crime victims is never broken. &quot;I later
learned he had committed a crime in Texas for which he got a 10-year sentence:
he served three months. He just raped a 12 year old. And he had wedged
himself between me and my car.&quot; -Sonya Dowdy</P>

<P>Under Clinton, they get an Attorney General who told prosecutors that
the Second Amendment's days are numbered: &quot;We can do something about
guns, if only this nation would rise up and tell the NRA to get lost!&quot;
In fact, we can do something about violent crime, if only this nation would
rise up and tell the chief law enforcement officer of the United States
to take her hatred of 3.2 million law-abiding citizens and channel it against
the violent criminals-and reserve treatment programs for crime victims.</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO SMIRKS AT SELF-DEFENSE</P>

<P>The day Clinton and Reno introduced their crime bill, NRA send CBS's
&quot;This Morning&quot; press clips of women who've defended themselves
with handguns purchased hours before they were attacked: Sonya Dowdy of
North Carolina defended herself with a gun received 15 minutes before an
attack. Rayna Ross of Virginia thwarted a knife attack with a gun purchased
the day before. The family of Virgen Blanca of Texas thwarted a repeat-intruder
with a gun purchased the day before.</P>

<P>But when CBS's Paula Zahn raised the issue of self-defense, the nation's
cheif law enforcement officer had one response: a smirk. &quot;This bill
is designed to get deadly assault weapons out of the hands of civilians.&quot;
she added.</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: A FEDERAL POLITICAL POLICE FORCE</P>

<P>This summer, secret documents inadvertently released by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation revealed that, under Clinton, the agency was given
the greed light to lobby for passages of the &quot;Brady bill.&quot; And
even for the FBI, Brady was just a start. FBI documents revealed a larger
campaign: semiautomatic firearms bans, restrictive licensing, a ban on
ammunition commonly used in hunting and personal protection, gun owner
registration, and federal qualifications for gun purchasers with buy-back
programs for the disqualified. The plan to convert FBI to a federal police
force was made complete by a &quot;publicity&quot; campaign-a proposed
taxpayer-funded lobbying effort expressly forbidden by federal law.</P>

<P>In firing FBI Director William Sessions soon after the documents were
made public, Bill Clinton faced a unique political opportunity. He could
assure the American people of the FBI's independence from politics and
salvage the morale of agents increasingly troubled over FBI politicization
in Clinton's own &quot;TravelGate&quot; fiasco-all with just four words
to his nominee: &quot;Stay out of politics.&quot; He didn't, or nominee
Judge Louis Freeh didn't listen. In responding to questions on the Brady
bill before the U.S. Senate July 30th, Freeh said only that such initiatives
should not be made public: &quot;I would not disagree or attempt to set
aside a recommendation which my predecessor has already made-although not
publicly, his recommendation was made in confidence to the Attorney General.
I would not set that aside or disagree with it.&quot; On the Brady bill,
the &quot;first step&quot; to more restrictions: &quot;I would enthusiastically
and vigorously support its enforcement.&quot; And on banning guns, he said,
&quot;The strongest piece of gun legislation [which Congress passes] I
would enforce diligently, completely and exhaustively. With that law on
the books...there would be no respite with respect to its enforcement.&quot;
&quot;Everybody has a right to be protected. And they deserve a chance
to have a gun. It's in the Bill of Rights.&quot; -Sonya Dowdy</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: A MASS MURDER COVER-UP</P>

<P>On July 23, 1993, U.S. Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) wrote to Lloyd Bentsen
and Janet Reno, concerned about the investigation into the deadly assault
on the Idaho home of Randy Weaver and the deaths of some 80 people at the
compound in Waco, Texas. Craig wrote: &quot;My own review has led me to
draw some preliminary conclusions hinting at problems larger than the Weaver/Harris
matter-pre-existing problems that were manifested in Idaho and potentially
in Waco, but are not limited to either case.&quot; &quot;Do you think there'd
be any convincing the politicians?&quot;-Sonya Dowdy Craig closed by saying
he looked forward to the results of the investigation. The Senator may
have quite a wait. The Clinton administration is covering up the Waco debacle.
His Treasury Department is attempting to hide the work of the &quot;Waco
Administrative Review Group&quot; under the guise of a separate &quot;system
of records&quot; exempted from public disclosure.</P>

<P>Arguing that releasing the records would &quot;allow individuals to
learn whether they have been identified as suspects,&quot; Clinton's cronies
forgot that most of the suspects are dead. Killed. Mention of any others
in official records can be bloated out to safeguard legitimate law enforcement
interests while the larger record is released in the public interest. Clinton's
unelected bureaucrats have given Americans only 30 days to object to the
secrecy. At press time, the Clinton cover-up is nearly a done deal.</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: A CONGRESS HUNGRY FOR YOUR GUNS</P>

<P>Politicians like Howard Metzenbaum and Charles Schumer have aimed for
your guns before. Now they've got a plan with presidential power. Senator
Metzenbaum's S.653 makes it a crime to &quot;transfer or possess&quot;
certain semiautomatic firearms, including some .22 rimfire self-loading
rifles. The bill also gives the Treasury Department the power to ban any
other semiautomatic firearm at the discretion of a political appointee
elected by no one. Senator Dennis DeConcini bans specific domestic and
imported self-loading firearms in S.639/H.R.1472. Senator Metzenbaum wants
much more: &quot;Until we ban all of them, we might as well ban none...&quot;
Metzenbaum said during an August 3rd hearing.</P>

<P>Politicians not only have the power to grab the guns millions of Americans
own, but the ammunition used for self-defense. Senator Daniel Moynihan's
S.178 (called cosmetically the &quot;Violent Crime Prevention Act&quot;)
prohibits the manufacture, transfer or importation of 9mm,.32 and .25 caliber
ammunition. His S.179 slaps a 1000 percent federal tax on 9mm, .32 and
.25 caliber ammunition. If you're wealthy, you have rights. If you're poor,
you're dead. And Congressman Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), in H.R.544, wants
to make it a federal crime for any individual to purchase more than one
handgun within a 30 day period. To Torricelli, firearms ownership is a
privilege to be rationed, not a constitutional right to be safeguarded.
Like other gun rationing advocates, he's ignorant of the facts. Since enactment
of a similar law in South Carolina, violent crime has risen steadily.</P>

<P>They have a plan-and the power-to grab your guns, your ammo and your
land. In a move to stop hunting and hunter access in an area the size of
Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, the misnamed &quot;California
Desert Protection Act.&quot; turns back the clock on scientific wildlife
management and reverses progress made in restoring game and non-game species
in the California desert. And it's a dangerous precedent: what they can
do in the desert, they can do in the hills and mountains of anywhere in
the U.S.A.</P>

<P>UNDER CLINTON: CITIZENS WHO'VE HAD ENOUGH</P>

<P>Never before have Americans faced a U.S. President so bent on restricting
the Second Amendment of the Constitution at the expense of crime victims.
</P>

<P>Never before has the director of the nation's premier law enforcement
agency openly expressed support for the strongest infringements on Second
Amendment rights.</P>

<P>And never before has the Congress so blatantly and adamantly called
for laws clearly written to shred the Bill of Rights, roll back America's
cultural tradition of hunting and our precious natural resources. For the
Bill of Rights, American history is beginning a new chapter. Only the individual
members of the National Rifle Association of America will decide whether
it's the Second Amendment's last chapter or a lasting record of its continuing
struggle.</P>

<P>With your commitment. Our children will read in the history of this
crucial era the first account of renewed liberty. They will learn of our
concerted drive against violent crime that carried us safely into the next
century. And they will discover that the ultimate crime against the Bill
of Rights was prevented, because American patriots cared enough to fight
for what's right.</P>

<P>FIGHTING CRIME - THE NRA WAY.</P>

<P>Each year, 60,000 predators are convicted of crime and never go to prison.
That includes 1,200 murderers, 7,000 rapists and 36,000 convicted of aggravated
assault. And each year their numbers grow by 60,000 more.</P>

<P>In the face of a tidal wave of violence, our nation is repeating its
worst domestic policy failure of the 1960s and 1970s: it is locking up
proportionately fewer offenders. At a reckless pace, Bill Clinton and like-minded
politicians in a growing number of states are abandoning the proven policy
of incapacitation and embracing the failed policy of rehabilitation. More
&quot;earned time&quot; credit. More unchecked plea bargaining. More automatic
paroles. More &quot;alternatives to incarceration.&quot; </P>

<P>More crime. Fewer rights for crime victims. Politicians like Bill Clinton
are not surrendering our streets to the criminals. They're giving them
away. The father of basketball superstar Michael Jordan may have been the
victim of this catch-and-release criminal justice travesty. One suspect
in the case served less than two years0for assault with a deadly weapon-an
ax-with intent to kill, plus armed robbery. The other suspect was months
on bond awaiting trial on charges that he nearly crushed a woman's skull
with a cinder block. </P>

<P>President Bill Clinton's answer to this merciless revolving-door system?
Spin the door faster. Clinton has cut a half a billion dollars from federal
prison construction. In its place, he wants 50,000 new police-a down-payment
on his campaign pledge of 100,000 officers.</P>

<P>Surely, there are jurisdictions that are under-patrolled and precincts
under-staffed. Americans, both citizens and police, don't want 50,000 new
police as much as they need 10,000 new prosecutors and judges. Without
any of Clinton's new recruits, Lumberton, North Carolina, is drowning in
criminal cases. The D.A&gt; who's handling the Jordan murder case told
the press he has a thousand pending cases. As in most locales, law enforcement
there is doing a great job. It's the bottleneck downstream-prosecutors,
the courts, prisons-that keeps skull-crushing monsters in business.</P>

<P>So why the Clinton bid for thousands of new police? Politics. According
to Clinton domestic policy advisor Bruce Reed: &quot;The best thing politically
for Bill Clinton is to have people look out their window, see a cop on
the corner and say: 'Bill Clinton put that cop there.'&quot; By focusing
on appearances instead of action, Bill Clinton ensures that any thug his
new officer arrests will be back on the streets faster than the officer
makes it home.</P>

<P>If the community policing strategy is right for your locale, fine. But
don't ignore the real answer to runaway violent crime: more prosecutors,
courts and prisons.</P>

<P>Through its CrimeStrike Division, NRA has an answer to violent crime-18
essential reforms for an effective criminal justice system. Representing
a consensus of some of the best criminal justice minds in the country.
CrimeStrike's &quot;Essential Elements&quot; include:</P>

<P>*Mandatory prison sentences for the most serious offenders, including
use of a deadly weapon and sex offenses against women and children.</P>

<P>*&quot;Real Offense&quot; Sentencing to ensure offenders are sentenced
for their &quot;real offense,&quot; not what they were able to plea-bargain.</P>

<P>*Mandatory life without release for a third conviction of violent or
serious felony similar to the &quot;3 Strikes You're Out&quot; initiative
backed by NRA in Washington state.</P>

<P>*Death penalty for first degree murder with aggravating circumstances.</P>

<P>*Tough, determinate sentences with &quot;truth-in-sentencing,&quot;
coupled with prison release policies that require every inmate to serve
no less than 85% of prison sentence.</P>

<P>*Affordable prisons and jails which do not allow persons in custody
to live better than law-abiding persons living at the poverty level.</P>

<P>*Comprehensive, effective juvenile justice reform with early intervention
for youth at risk.</P>

<P>*Adequate prison capacity with authority to privatize institutions.</P>

<P>*Protection against civil and criminal liability for a person's exercise

<P>NASA, THE MOON AND ANTI-GRAVITY</P>

<P>According to conventional science, the moon has only one-sixth of the
Earth's gravity. Sir Isaac Newton formulated the Law of Universal Gravitation
in 1666 which led to this conclusion. The famous law states that the gravitational
pull of one body on another body depends on the product of the masses of
the two bodies. Therefore, a planet such as the earth will attract another
object with this force. The further out in space one goes, the less attraction
is exerted on it by the body. That the moon's gravity is one sixth of the
earth's has been assumed for centuries, through there is now evidence that
this is not the case. William L. Brian II, a Nuclear Engineer from Oregon
State University investigated what he calls a &quot;NASA cover-up&quot;
in his 1982 book entitled: &quot;MOONGATE: SUPPRESSED FINDINGS OF THE U.S.
SPACE PROGRAM (THE NASA-MILITARY COVERUP).&quot; Brian centers his argument
for a cover-up on the so-called &quot;neutral point&quot; between the earth
and the moon. This neutral point, and all gravitational bodies have them,
is the point where a space vehicle enters the predominant attractive zone
of the moon's gravity. It is the region in space where the earth's force
of attraction equals the moon's force of attraction. Since the moon is
smaller and supposedly has a lesser surface gravity, the neutral point
should be quite close to the moon. If the moon has one sixth of the earth's
gravity, the neutral point is calculated to be about nine-tenths of the
distance between the earth and the moon. The average distance to the moon
is about 239,000 miles; hence this places the neutral point approximately
23,900 miles from the moon's center. Throughout the fifties and sixties,
the neutral point between the earth and the moon was given over and over
again as between 22,078 and 25,193 miles from the center of the moon. These
figures, merely logical guesses from trained scientists, were based upon
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. However, only be observing falling
or orbiting bodies in the moon's vicinity could the actual neutral point
distance, hence the moon's true gravity, be determined. Using the above
neutral point and assumed gravity for their calculations, the U.S. and
the Soviet Union began to send space probes to the moon in the late fifties.
They met with a miserable failure. The Russians were the first to launch
a successful lunar probe, Luna 1, on January 2, 1959. It flew within 4,660
miles of the moon and broadcast back information before continuing on into
deep space. The U.S. made three unsuccessful attempts before achieving
a fly-by of 37,000 miles from the surface some months after Luna 1 with
their Pioneer 4. The Russian's Luna 2 became the first space probe to hit
the moon and Luna 3 Circled the far side of the moon, approached within
4,372 miles, and sent back photos of the far side. Strangely, Russian moon
exploration came to a four year stop after these successes. Furthermore,
the Russian's were intensely secretive about the data they collected. The
American efforts were almost laughable at first. The Ranger Space Probes
were designed to hard land on the moon with seismometers in spherical containers
designed to withstand the impacts on the moon. Ranger 3, launched on January
26, 1962, missed its target completely and went into a solar orbit. Ranger
4, hit the moon but did not send back any useful information. Ranger 5
missed the moon by 450 miles and then the effort was put off for two years
while the entire program was reorganized--something was wrong with their
calculations! Ranger 6, launched on January 30, 1964, allegedly had its
electrical system burn out in flight and no pictures were sent. Subsequent
Ranger probes were more successful. The Russians reactivated their space
probes, but their Luna 5; launched on May 9, 1964; crashed at full speed
on the moon, when it was intended to make a soft landing. Luna 6 utterly
missed the moon, and Luna 7 crashed on the moon's surface when its retro-rockets
supposedly fired too soon. Luna 8 also crashed on the moon, but Luna 9
became the first probe to successfully soft land on the moon. Missions
became more successful after this, and Brian alleges that this is because
the Soviets and Americans had been able to recalculate the neutral point
and correct gravity of the moon from the many failures (and the few successes).
The strangest thing to come out of the reanalyzing of &quot;observing bodies
fall and orbit the moon&quot; was for NASA to come up with a new neutral
point between the earth and the moon. And this is the key to &quot;a NASA
cover-up&quot;, according to Brian. The July 25, 1969 issue of Time magazine
stated that the neutral point was 43,495 miles from the center of the moon.
Werner von Braun in the 1969 edition of &quot;History of Rocketry &amp;
Space Travel&quot;, said that the neutral point was 43,495 miles from the
center of the moon. Other reliable sources, obtaining their information
from NASA, claimed that the neutral point was between 38,000 and 43,495
miles from the center of the moon. The pre-Apollo distances were given
as 20,000 to 25,000 miles from the center of the moon. NASA, it appears,
had recalculated the neutral point, which would indicate that the moon's
gravity is not one sixth, as Newton had stated. We invite readers to research
these figures for themselves. According to Brian, if the neutral point
of the moon's gravity is 43,495 miles from the moon, then the gravitation
of the moon is 64% of the Earth's surface gravity, not one-sixth or 16.7%
as predicted by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation! Bizarrely, NASA
and the status-quo of science and government continue to allude that the
moon's gravity is one-sixth that of the earth's, representative of a neutral
point less than 25,193 miles from the moon. Brian goes on to say that if
the neutral point were more like 52,000 miles instead of 43,495 miles from
the moon, the moon's surface gravity would be identical to the earths!
Brian's data dwells heavily on inconsistent and contradictory information
released through NASA, indicating an official cover-up. Brian's book goes
on to list other evidence that the moon has a higher gravity than previously
assumed; in fact, a gravity nearly equal the earth's! He points out the
flight times of the Apollo spacecraft are inconsistent and much faster
than if the moon had only one-sixth gravity, as the vehicle would continue
to decelerate until it reached the neutral point, at which point it would
begin to accelerate again as it became pulled by the moon's gravity. Assuming
that Brian is right about a higher surface gravity on the moon, then the
ramification of the high gravity on the fuel requirements of the lunar
descent and ascent vehicle of the manned Apollo program to the moon are
horrific! The Apollo launch rocket weighed 6,400,000 pounds. The payloads
of the Lunar Module are correct, assuming that the moon had only one-sixth
gravity. However, under a high lunar gravity the Lunar module would have
had to have been nearly as large as a Titan 2 rocket which weighs 330,000
pounds and was 103 feet tall (the actual Lunar module, according to NASA,
weighed 33,200 pounds)! The startling conclusion is that if men really
landed on the moon in high lunar gravity conditions, it was not done with
rockets! These amazing conclusions, backed up by many scientists and using
NASA data itself, raise a number of questions: Why did the Russians apparently
pull out of the space race when they were hot on the trail of putting a
man on the moon? How did the United States succeed when rockets would clearly
not work in the high lunar gravity conditions? What was the military's
involvement in top secret research which led to the successful moon landings?
Did we even go to the moon as claimed? One publication, also by a former
NASA employee, uses the same information from NASA used by Brian to &quot;prove&quot;
that we never made the trip! (This book is &quot;We Never Went To The Moon&quot;,
by Bill Kaysing, 1981, Desert Publications, Cornville, Arizona). Brian
goes on to offer more &quot;proof&quot; that the moon's gravity is nearly
equal to that of earth's, and that NASA staged the whole show in order
to fake a one-sixth gravity, presumably to hide the fact that they had
to use the ultra-secret &quot;anti-gravity&quot; device that were what
really powered the Lunar Module. Consider these &quot;facts&quot;: In one
sixth gravity, a 180 pound man would weigh a mere 30 pounds. Writers had
programmed the public to expect athletic feats of a spectacular nature
when astronauts explored the moon. In the November 1967 issue of Science
Digest and article entitled, &quot;How To Walk on the Moon&quot; was printed
that predicted that men would be able to make 14-foot slow-motion leaps,
perform backflips and other gymnastics like professionals, and be able
to easily move up ladders and poles with their arms. An astronaut, even
in a cumbersome suit could jump six times higher on the moon than earth.
Even though the alleged weight of the spacesuits and backpacks of the astronauts
was 185 pounds, the total combined weight of a 185 pound astronaut and
his suit would be only 62 pounds. This is still only one third of the astronaut's
weight. Therefore, the astronauts should have been able to jump vertically
far higher than they could on Earth without any burden. Brian believes
that an average man can jump about 18 inches high without a run. Basketball
players routinely jump over three feet high. However, though astronauts
such as John Young made a number of leaps while on the moon, they never
jumped more than about 18 inches in height, while they were theoretically
capable of slow backflips! Brian believes that this is explained by the
evidence that the moon's gravity is not one sixth, but much heavier, and
that the spacesuits did not weight as much as NASA said. Young and other
astronauts were, essentially not capable of jumping more than 18 inches
off the ground. Evidence that the suits weighed far less and 185 pounds
is given that the astronauts practiced in the same suits at an area of
Oregon known as the &quot;Bend&quot;. What would be the point of doing
maneuvers in a 185 pound space suit, when on the moon the astronaut and
suit would weigh a mere combined total of 62 pounds? Furthermore, how did
they manage to do maneuvers if the suits weighed so much in the first place?
Brian estimates from his own research that the spacesuits and backpacks
weighed a combined total of about 75 pounds. Brian also discusses the scene
in which during Apollo 12 when astronaut Conrad jumped the final three
feet from the bottom of the ladder to the moon's surface. He mentioned
that the three foot jump may have been a short one for Neil, but for him
it was a long one. Later, when he was scooping up a contingency sample
of moon material, astronaut Bean warned him not to fall over since he appeared
to be leaning forward too far. Supposedly, it would be difficult for him
to get up in the moon suit if he fell over. Brian analyses the scene by
saying that jumping off a three foot ladder in one sixth gravity would
be like jumping from a 6 inch height on the earth. Even with a heavy suit
and back on, it would scarcely have been felt the astronaut, and they could
have lowered themselves down with their arm strength alone. Furthermore,
should Conrad have fallen over, they should have been able to right themselves
with a simple arm push. Furthermore, astronaut Charles Duke during Apollo
16 fell a number of times while on the moon. Since objects on the moon
would supposedly take two and a half times longer to fall in one-sixth
gravity, Duke should have had plenty of time to catch himself. Brian finds
it incredible that the astronauts during Apollo 14 failed to climb cone
crater as was planned. At one point during the mission, astronaut Sheppard
went down on one knee to pick up a rock and required the aid of astronaut
Mitchell to stand up! About two-thirds of the way to their destination,
their heart rates were up to 120 beats per minute as they moved uphill.
After four hours of travel, the two astronauts were still a half hour away,
they estimated from their goal, and Sheppard estimated that they could
not reach the top of the crater in that time, so they abandoned the mission.
This is all the more astonishing in that the crater is little more than
a hill, the entire distance to be traveled was estimated as 1.8 miles.
If the astronauts were two-thirds of the distance, they should have been
able to travel the remaining half a mile in six minutes, assuming that
they traveled a speed of five miles an hour on the moon in one-sixth gravity.
And yet, they estimated that half an hour would not be enough! Brian comments
on a great deal more material which he finds inconsistent in the Apollo
missions, including inconsistencies in the Moon Rover, but his final comment
is quite revealing. During Apollo 17 astronauts Cernan and Schmitt began
their first assignment by deploying and loading the Rover. Cernan apparently
became quite excited and his Capsule Communicator, astronaut Parker warned
him that his metabolic rate was going up. This meant that he was using
more oxygen. Cernan replied that he had never felt calmer in his life and
indicated to Parker that they would take it easy. He mentioned to Parker
that he thought Cernan was working at one-sixth gravity. Cernan's reply
was, &quot;Yes. You know where we are . . . whatever.&quot; Brian suggests
that the latter remark by Cernan in response to the moon's gravity seems
to suggest that he wanted to avoid the discussion. Perhaps Parker was not
aware of the high gravity situation and asked an embarrassing question.
Brian's book is fascinating, though not without flaw. For instance, he
does not seem to understand the difference between the fundamental physical
concepts of mass and weight. However, his discussion of the discrepancy
of stated values of the neutral point between the earth and the moon appears
valid. If Brian is correct, and the moon's gravity is nearly that of the
earth's, then we are faced with the question of how and if NASA &quot;really
did it.&quot; Perhaps NASA just faked it, as suggested in the movie Capricorn
One and discussed in the book, We Never Went To The Moon. On the other
hand, Brian and others suggest that we did in fact go to the moon, but
we defeated the high gravity conditions not with rockets, but with anti-gravity
devices. That the Lunar Module was in reality an anti-gravity device has
been suggested by several researchers. Brian claims that in high lunar
gravity conditions, the LM could not have taken off from the moon, and
that it's ascent is not consistent with that of a rocket powered vehicle.
he also states that no rocket exhaust can be seen from the lunar module
after it's initial explosion. Does the moon have a high surface gravity,
greater than one-sixth? Does gravity control really exist? If so, why do
we continue to expend billions of dollars on dangerous rockets that can
explode on take-off? If NASA has developed anti-gravity devices based on
Einstein's unified field, then have we really stopped going to the moon?
Perhaps the science-fiction of the Star Wars movies is more of a reality
than NASA would have us believe!</P>

<P>WHY ARE FRENCH HEMOPHILIACS DYING OF AIDS? BECAUSE FRENCH OFFICIALS
KNOWINGLY GAVE THEM TAINTED BLOOD.</P>

<P>B L O O D M O N E Y</P>

<P>This is a horror story, and it's far from over. It began in 1985 in
France, a country often envied for its system of universal health care
and tradition of medical excellence. In one of the most shameful episodes
of the AIDS epidemic, physicians and government officials there knowingly
allowed at least a thousand people to receive blood or blood products contaminated
by the virus that causes the disease. Three hundred of those people-mainly
hemophiliacs, many of them children-are already dead. The rest are going
to die, barring a miracle.</P>

<P>They are, of course, not the only victims of transfusion- related AIDS.
At the epidemic's start in the early 1980s, before a viral cause was found
and the blood supply could be protected, many hemophiliacs and people who
received transfusions were likewise infected by contaminated blood. The
tragedy, born out of ignorance, occurred in nearly every country in the
world. But in France what began as ignorance turned into calculated connivance.
Using tainted blood stocks became a matter of economic expediency and government-sanctioned
policy. The callous handling of the affair is widely believed to have contributed
to the rout of the ruling Socialist party in last March's elections. Two
years ago, when the scandal broke, Georgina Dufoix, who in l985 oversaw
the health system as minister of social affairs, protested her innocence
on television. &quot;I feel re- sponsible,&quot; she told a flabbergasted
audience, &quot;but not guilty&quot; To the disgust of many, when the case
first came to trial last summer both she and former health minister Edmond
Herve, her subordinate, were conspicuously absent from the dock. Instead
the rap was taken by lesser government officials and by Michel Garretta,
a physician (now suspended) and former director of the National Center
for Blood Transfusions (known as the CNTS in France). &quot;I'm not ashamed,&quot;
he said in his defense, with a disingenuousness that echoed Dufoix's. &quot;The
decisions I made at the time, I would make again, for myself and my own
children.&quot; Garretta has never stopped claiming that not enough was
known about AIDS even in early 1985 to foresee that hemophiliacs and transfusees
were running a mortal risk. Nor was he alone, he insisted at his trial,
in failing to act when he did know the truth. &quot;Thousands of people
were informed,&quot; he said, &quot;but they didn't necessarily draw the
consequences.&quot; Why not? There are answers, but none offers much comfort.</P>

<P>IN 1983 U.S. BLOOD BANKS WARNED THAT THE CAUSE OF AIDS WAS PROBABLY
TO BE FOUND IN BLOOD. THE FRENCH RESPONSE WAS &quot;BEATIFIC OPTIMISM.&quot;</P>

<P>Hemophilia is a genetic disease that afflicts males almost exclusively.
Those affected suffer crises of uncontrolled internal bleeding because
they lack proteins, most commonly one called factor VIII, that are needed
to clot blood. Until the 1960s such a crisis was usually treated with a
hospital transfusion of fresh whole blood or plasma (The fluid part of
the blood, which contains the critical proteins). But all that changed
with the introduction of cryoprecipitate-the sediment of frozen plasma,
which is five times richer than fresh blood in clotting proteins. A method
was soon developed to concentrate clotting proteins from the pooled blood
of hundreds of donors. Available in easily stored powered form, these concentrates
not only let hemophiliacs treat themselves but also enabled them to work
and travel with unprecedented freedom. The drawback of the concentrates
was that a single donor infected with a blood-borne disease (the most dreaded
before the 1980s was hepatitis) could contaminate all the concentrates
made from a batch of pooled blood. France's hemophiliacs, however, felt
relatively safe from that risk. &quot;In this country&quot; explains Francis
Graeve, honorary presi- dent of the Association of French Hemophiliacs,
&quot;blood is freely donated.&quot; French addicts couldn't sell their
disease-ridden blood for the price of a bottle or a fix (whereas in the
United States it was technically possible to sell blood until 1981, and
paying for plasma remains the norm). In the French view, giving blood was
a noble act, and donors were respected as healthy, civic-minded people.
Unfortunately many drug addicts in Paris gave blood to get the free sandwiches
and coffee handed out at collection posts. The French blood system was
a perplexing marriage of genuine idealism and charity, hitched to a quasi-feudal
power structure. At the top was the Ministry for Social Affairs, which
pays all medical costs in France through the Social Security Administration.
Next came the Ministry of Health, which granted the exclusive right to
collect and distribute blood to</P>

<P>160 transfusion centers (a network of independent, government- regulated
bodies). Seven of these were large regional centers responsible for manufacturing
and distributing blood products such as clotting factors, according to
prices set by the ministry. The most powerful regional fife (as you might
guess from its name) was the National Center for Blood Transfusions in
Paris, a gleaming black steel-and-glass bastion in the city's quiet fifteenth
arrondissement. Its factory was already satisfy - ing about half the national
demand for blood plasma and concentrates and was trying to do better. (In
1982 the Ministry of Health granted the CNTS a monopoly on imported blood
products, with instructions to reduce them and bolster national self-sufficiency.)
Together with its research advisers, who included top hematologists at
Paris 's giant public hospitals, the CNTS was a formidable operation. The
CNTS didn't initially think AIDS was its problem. In 1981 , when the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced its first cases , most were
occurring in homosexual men; the first AIDS diagnosis in an American hemophiliac
in January 1982 didn't alter the French perception that this was a gay
disease whose prime vector was semen. By March 1983, however, more unsettling
news had arrived from the United States. In the journal Transfusion, read
by hematologists the world over, American blood banks joined forces to
announce &quot;eight confirmed cases of AIDS in hemophiliacs treated with
antihemophilic factor&quot; and to warn that the still unknown causal agent
was probably to be found in blood. The startling response of the Ministry
of Health to this news was &quot;beatific optimism,&quot; according to
physician-journalist Anne-Marie Casteret, writing in the May 4 edition
of the doctors' daily, Le Quotidien du medecin. The ministry was apparently
not alone in ignoring the warning. The CNTS's research director, a hematologist
named Jean-Pierre Alllain, maintained that &quot;no relation has been demonstrated
between a very high number of transfusions and AIDS.&quot; Yet in June.</P>

<P>Allain himself published a study of 2,300 French hemophiliacs that suggested
otherwise: six of his subjects showed clinical signs of AIDS, such as swollen
lymph nodes and striking weight loss.. (There were no tests yet for the
still mysterious causative agent. A retrovirus had been isolated from a
patient that February by Luc Montagier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris,
but whether this virus caused AIDS remained to be confirmed.) What's more,
three of the six hemophiliacs showing signs of AIDS in Allain's study had
been receiving clotting factor made only from the blood of French donors.
It seemed that the French blood supply might not be pristine after all.
In July Ler Mode,France's newspaper of record, reported the first case
of AIDS in a French hemophiliac. That summer the ministry, chief medical
counsel, General Director of Health Jacques Roux, circulated a letter to
transfusion centers telling them to be wary off blood donations from people
in all the known risk groups, which now included intravenous drug users.
But beatific indifference prevailed. A ministry survey conducted shortly
afterward revealed that even in Paris-a city with a disproportionate share
of AIDS cases-a majority of blood banks didn't think of their donors as
presenting any risk. The myth of pure French blood was so pervasive that
in January 1984 a program to collect blood in prisons was actually stepped
up. (Studies for the following year showed that 25% of France's contaminated
units came from prisons.)</P>

<P>By the fall of 1983 Montagnier, at the Pasteur Institute, had developed
a prototype test to screen blood for antibodies to the virus he believed
was responsible for AIDS. This test involved mixing drops of blood with
proteins from the virus that were known to cause an antibody response:
a color change indicated that an antibody reaction had taken place and
that the blood was probably infected. An initial study of French hemophiliacs
using the Pasteur test identified &quot;a strong incidence&quot; of antibodies
to the virus in 133 French hemophiliacs. These results were announced-but
not published or fleshed out with numbers-by CNTS lab chief Anne-Marie
Courouce at an in-house conference on March 13, 1984. The myth of pure
French blood was crumbling fast. Yet the CNTS did not reveal these findings
to the Ministry of Health. Nor did CNTS share its information with the
hemophiliacs' association, whose officers were in the very same building.</P>

<P>This fog of willful optimism was penetrated almost by accident. The
events were set in motion not long after U.S. AIDS researcher Robert Gallo
stole Luc Montagnier's thunder by announcing in April 1984 that the retrovirus
both had been studying, the one we now call the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), was indeed the cause of AIDS. That July an ener- getic French
immunologist, Jacques Leibowitch, called Francois Pinon, chief of hematology
at the giant Cochin Hospital of] Paris, requesting a favor. A family member
was to have surgery at the hospital, and Leibowitch wanted to send Pinon
some AIDS-free blood donors that he'd selected himself. Pinon was offended;
he protested that his blood supplies were perfectly safe. But he was impressed
that Leibowitch had come up with his own way to screen blood for HIV antibodies-
neither Montagnier's Pasteur test nor any other was yet on the market.
(Leibowitch's method was to add blood samples to lab dishes containing
HIV -infected cells; an antibody response in the dish meant that the blood
being tested contained antibodies to the virus and, thus, that the donor
was already infected.) The two men subsequently decided to run a study
on Pinon's stocks . Neither realized how terrifying the results would be
.. That same July, at the congress of the International Blood Transfusion
Society in Munich, word went out that heating blood products could inactivate
tbe AIDS virus. Even though there were no published data yet, no transfusion
specialist could afford to ignore the implications. Indeed, Garretta, then
assistant director of the CNTS, opened negotiations while still in Munich
to license a heat treatment from Immuno, an Austrian firm. But at the time,
no deal was closed. Garretta became director of the CNTS the following
October He inherited an institution that was deeply dependent on Ministry
of Health subsidies to meet its operating losses; in addition, it was far
from its goal of making France self-sufficient in blood products. Garretta
immediately stepped up factor VIII production without waiting to develop
heating techniques, despite a report in the medical journal The Lancet
in September that heat treatment killed animal retroviruses. It was a terrible
miscalculation. Just how terrible became clear on December 12, when Leibowitch
finished screening the Cochin blood stocks. Ten of the 2,000 blood samples
provided by Pinon tested positive for HlV antibodies. (To make sure, the
results were independently confirmed by a much more laborious test called
a Western blot.) Aghast, Pinion did some fast mental arithmetic. Public
hospitals in Paris alone used 500,000 units of blood per year, based on
an infection rate of five units per thousand (0 . 5 percent) , that translated
into 2,500 contamination per year, or roughly seven new infections per
day. He issued a written warning to the doctors at Cochin to cut transfusions
to a bare minimum and then called the Ministry of Health and the CNTS.</P>

<P>The implications for Garretta were inescapable: each batch of the CNTS's
factor VIII was prepared from as many as 5,000 pooled blood donations,
so the chances of any batches escaping contamination were almost nil. By
upping his production, Garretta had accelerated the epidemic. Pinon had
confirmed what at least one of the CNTS 's top officials, the research
director Allain, already suspected. For some time Allain had been procuring
imported, heated concentrates for a young patient of his, a hemophiliac
teenager he'd taken into his own home; he warned the boy to destroy his
unheated CNTS stocks because tbe heated concentrates were &quot;purer.&quot;
But the vague admonition didn't stop the boy from injecting unheated factor
VIII one night that December when he felt a Painful bleeding crisis coming
on. Allain's wife, also a CNTS employee, exploded when she learned what
had happened. &quot;You idiot! &quot; she said to the boy. &quot;How could
you do that? &quot; He had previously tested seronegative; he became seropositive.
By February 1985 the case for heat-treating blood was closed. In two reports
in The Lancet, Montagnier confirmed that heat killed the AIDS virus and
that heated concentrates prevented infection. &quot;Virgin&quot; (previously
untreated) French hemophiliacs given only heated factor VIII tested negative
for HIV &quot;while those treated with unheated factor VIII tested positive
. Hurriedly&quot; Garretta signed a deal with Immuno for its heating technology.
But it would be months before his factory could be refitted, and only imports
of heated factor VIII could avert a tragedy in tbe interim. Still he held
back. If the CNTS asked the ministry to cover the cost of the imports,
its officials might want to know why it had taken so long to discover the
tainted-blood crisis and protect the blood supply. As Allain had warned
Garretta in January (in what Allain later claimed was a last-ditch attempt
to stop the catastrophe), &quot;Garretta was exposing the CNTS to&quot;
discredit and failure, in the achievement of one of its fundamental missions.
So Garretta began covering his track? That spring a CNTS official persuaded
Pinon to join an anti-AIDS strategy group. It was &quot;a way to not really
take into account, our alarm signal,&quot; Pinon summed up later, &quot;and
it is my impression that it delayed a decision.&quot; Pinon and the rest
of the group called for the immediate introduction of heat treated products,
imported from abroad if necessary. But in May, when the presiding CNTS
official submitted the group's report to the Ministry of Health, the document
included a phrase that recommended deferring the decision to recall or
to leave the unheated products in circulation to a higher government authority.
</P>

<P>Not that the ministry would necessarily have heeded Pinon and his colleagues.
On March 12, 1985, General Director of Health Roux had received a report
from an aide concerning Pinon and Leibowitch's latest finding. The two
had located 19 seropositive donors at Cochin and another hospital with
blood bank facilities; recipients of factor VIII prepared from their blood
had been located, too. All were seropositive. The report concluded: &quot;It
is probable that all the blood products prepared from pools of Parisian
donors are now contaminated,&quot; with the word all underlined for emphasis.
Roux couldn't ignore this report. Yet, he says now, he had &quot;no power
to implement&quot; health policy. Only Health Minister Herve could ordain
the destruction of contaminated stocks and speed up donor testing. (Montagnier's
antibody test still wasn't available, but a test made by Abbott, a U.S.
company, had been approved for American use on March 2, 1985.) So Roux
forwarded this report to Herve's office with a letter appealing for action.
Herve denies receiving it. It wasn't until May 9, 1985 five long months
after Pinon Called the CNTS with his initial data-that Garretta himself
wrote to the Ministry of Social Affairs, saying that cleaning up the blood
supply was &quot;an absolute urgency.&quot; But the CNTS's boss also said
that a &quot;compromise&quot; had to he found &quot;between the imperatives
of public health and the economic constraints.&quot; By his calculations
&quot;from that time on &quot;every three months of delay&quot; in testing
donor and using heated factor VIII meant &quot;the deaths of five to ten
hemophiliacs and some of their close relations.&quot; His guess was based
on studies showing that only 10 percent of HIV-positive patients had so
far developed AIDS. (The CDC now estimates that thus far 29 percent of
infected people have gone on to develop AIDS; of those, some 63 percent
have died to date.) But the economic constrains, he groused , were &quot;considerable&quot;
: importing heated factor VIII alone would cost 41 millions francs (about
$5 million at the time); destroying contaminated stocks and making up the
20 percent production loss due to the heating process would cost millions
more. The Ministries of Health and Social Affairs, of course, would have
to cover those costs. To minimize them, Garretta recommended that the CNTS
continue to provide unheated products to its clients until mid-July. He
was proposing that they all accept a few more deaths between May and July
for the sake of staying on budget. </P>

<P>On May 10 the officers of the Association of French Hemophiliacs trustingly
played into his hands. Garretta had recently promised them that the CNTS
would soon be making heated products. However, pleading technical problems,
he had not named a date. He omitted one other detail, said the association's
honorary president Graeve: &quot;He never told us the stocks of unheated
factor VIII were contaminated.&quot; So the association asked only that
the ministry ban the sale of unheated blood concentrates after October
1, 1985-time enough, they figured, for Garretta to refit his plant. It
never occurred to them, said Graeve, that Garretta also &quot;needed to
get rid of his stocks.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, on May 9, another link had been forged in the chain of tragedy.
That day representatives of the prime minister and the Ministries of Health,
External Commerce, Social Affairs, and Finances met to discuss the Pasteu
Institute's production arm, Pasteur Diagnostics, which was struggling toward
commercializing Montagnier's test. Its American competitor, Abbott, had
already requested French government approval for its own test in February.
Everyone knew that compulsory testing of blood donors was long overdue.
But they figured that if Abbott seized the market for tests in France's
transfusion centers, there would be no market for Pasteur's product, in
France or elsewhere. (Just as the French felt cheated out of the discovery
of HIV, they now felt in danger of being squeezed out of the antibody-test
market.) It added up to a choice between buying foreign tests and saving
lives, or saving an annual market estimated at 91 million francs ($11 million)
for a French company. Once again, economics won. It was decided that &quot;the
licensing file for Abbott be held awhile longer,&quot; until Pasteur caught
up. On May 29, in the CNTS building, Garretta held another meeting with
his top officers. The fundamental question facing them, he said, was this:
&quot;Should we accept that all our products are contaminated?&quot; Unfortunately,
he added, recalling contaminated products would entail &quot;grave consequences.&quot;
According to the meetings minutes, a CNTS doctor named Jean Yves Muller
said: &quot;The important thing is to avoid contaminating the hemophiliacs
who aren't yet.&quot; But no one suggested how contaminations could be
avoided if the deadly concentrates remained on the market. Instead they
resolved to wait &quot;for the higher authorities&quot;-meaning the Ministry
of Health-&quot;to forbid us to sell these products, with the financial
consequences that this represents.&quot; In effect, they were asking their
superiors to stop them before they killed again.</P>

<P>On June 1, Allain met with the Consulting Commission on Blood Transfusion,
a watchdog for the ministry composed of government officials and physicians.
One regional center director who was present recalls that the commission
decided discreetly-this does not appear in the recommendations signed by
the 31 physicians presents-that &quot;just for a few weeks, a transition
period, you could inject the unheated product into people who were already
seropositive.&quot; Of course, he admitted, &quot;we knew we needed heated
products for all hemophiliacs.&quot; There were medical as well as ethical
concerns: Who knew what effect reinfection might have in an HIV-positive
patient? (According to CDC researchers, reinfection poses the risk of becoming
contaminated with a new strain of the virus that might be resistant to
AIDS drugs and could exacerbate the disease.)</P>

<P>There were scattered revolts against Garretta. In mid- June, Roux &quot;slammed
the door on a meeting&quot; of Health Minister Herve's cabinet and refused
to attend meetings of the Consulting Commission until heated blood products
were universally available. In a bureaucratic pique be declared that he
&quot;wouldn't defend the ministry's policy anymore.&quot; But that left
no one to oppose Garretta inside the Ministry of Health. No one upstairs
was listening, anyway. On June 27 Jean Ducos, a usually influential director
of a transfusion center in Tonlouse, wrote to Dufoix, the minister of social
affairs, begging to see her immediately. One month later her secretary
replied that &quot;previous engagements&quot; made a meeting impossible.
Ducos also wrote Herve at the Health Ministry that it was &quot;impossible
. . . in all conscience to continue to pressure hemophiliacs&quot; to accept
&quot;noxions&quot; products. Herve never responded. Meanwhile, Garretta
began planning how to sell off his contaminated wares. On June 26 he wrote
to his aides at the CNTS: &quot;The distribution of nonheated products
remains the normal procedure, so long as they are in stock.&quot; If prescribing
physicians didn't ask for safe goods, they wouldn't get them. Heated concentrates,
he added, were &quot;authorized&quot;-not required-only for recipients
who tested HIV-negative.</P>

<P>His aides bullied physicians to accept unheated concentrates. &quot;You
couldn't just say, 'This patient's seronegative; give us the heated products,'&quot;
recalled Thierry Lambert, a Parisian hematologist and researcher. &quot;Each
prescription had to be discussed&quot;-and the discussions were &quot;sometimes
difficult.&quot; To prevent sharing of the precious heated goods, no patient
was allowed more than a one-month supply.</P>

<P>The worst of it, the awful catch-22, was that hardly any physicians
could prove their patients were seronegative-because there were still no
screening tests on the open market. Approval for the Pasteur tests came
only at the end of June, when Prime Minister Laurent Fabius (alerted that
Casteret and other reporters were readying highly critical stories) announced
compulsory testing of donors. Even then the promise rang hollow, since
it was not until July 23 that the social security system agreed to reimburse
the costs of testing. (Abbott's test was approved in France the following
day.) What with delays in distribution and the training of test personnel,
by the end of 1985 only 1,670 hemophiliacs-fewer than half the 4,000 in
France-had been tested for HIV.</P>

<P>That same July 23 the Ministries of Health and Social Affairs decided
that Garretta could continue to sell his unheated stocks as long as anyone
would buy them. The only caveat was that after October 1 the social security
fund, which ordinarily reimburses prescription costs, wouldn't pay for
unheated factor VIII. Apparently the transition period agreed to by the
Consulting Commission in June would now extend into the fall.</P>

<P>On September 6 the Association of French Hemophiliacs belatedly saw
the light. Agreement with Garretta's plans, their leaders said at a meeting,
had not been meant as permission &quot;to off-load cumbersome products
onto unsuspecting hemophiliacs.&quot; They called for a ban on unheated
concentrates and alerted their membership and the media. Garretta subsequently
complained that they had ruined his &quot;realistic and responsible&quot;
strategy. He'd been forced to import more heated factor VIII than he'd
planned, and he was stuck with &quot;large stocks of unused French products.&quot;
The contaminated ones, that is. </P>

<P>In fact, he had already sold plenty. According to internal CNTS records,
1.6 million units of its unheated factor VIII were off-loaded between July
and October of 1985. The biggest sales were just before and after the summer
vacation-to hemophiliacs and parents of young hemophiliacs stocking up
for trips, or replenishing supplies when they came home. Graeve, of the
hemophiliacs' association, was among them. On July 12 he bought some unheated
factor VIII for his hemophiliac teenage son. Graeve doesn't know whether
the batch he bought was contaminated and, if so, whether it hastened his
son's death from AIDS. But this much is certain: Graeve would never have
knowingly given his child a substance that might harm him.</P>

<P>Just how many people were condemned to die between December 1984, when
the CNTS became aware of the extent of the crisis, and October 1985, when
its last contaminated products were sold? Garretta and his aides have always
contended that upwards of 90 percent of France's seropositive hemophiliacs
were infected before 1985, when contamination, so to speak, became official
policy. HOwever, a retrospective study conducted at two Paris hospitals
found 60 hemophiliacs for whom &quot;the year of seroconversion is known
with precision thanks to a reference serum drawn less than a year before.&quot;
Seventeen of the 60-28 percent-seroconverted in 1985.</P>

<P>Nor were hemophiliacs the only victims. At an inquiry late last year,
the CNTS's Courouce testified that &quot;a simple calculation shows that
around 200 people per month were contaminated&quot; by blood from infected
donors from April through August 1985, in the months before AIDS tests
were easily available. In other words, there were &quot;about 1,000 victims,&quot;
not counting the victims' subsequently infected spouses, lovers, or newborns.</P>

<P>The French judicial system is commonly viewed as an arm of the state
rather than as an independent power. It thus surprised no one in France
that when the first suit was filed by hemophiliacs in 1988, the investigating
magistrate in charge of the case moved at an excruciatingly cautious pace.
It would take four years for the case to come to trial. Meanwhile, among
the press, only Casteret took the story seriously. She began to visit former
CNTS and ministry officials and to amass a gigantic file of official documents-a
feat in a country where freedom of information has never existed. Yet the
hardest part, she recalled, was to believe what she was seeing &quot;I'm
a doctor,&quot; she said, &quot;and I couldn't conceive that a doctor would
follow an economic logic instead of a healing logic.&quot; She withheld
full publication until she had checked her work too much to doubt it. In
April 1991 her articles began to appear in the newsweekly L'Evenment du
jeudi.</P>

<P>One of her readers was Edmont-Luc Henry, an accountant and hemophiliac
who had been contaminated with HIV in 1984 while under treatment by a CNTS
physician. Enraged by Casteret's revelations, Henery filed charges against
&quot;a person or persons unknown&quot; for &quot;poisoning&quot;-a felony
that, in the French penal code, carries a life sentence. Apparently to
forestall a felony trial, the state's investigating magistrate abruptly
issued misdemeanor indictments against Garretta, Allain, Roux, and Roux's
Ministry of Health colleague Robert Netter. In March 1992 they were charged
with &quot;deception over the basis quality of a product,&quot; under a
law that Sabine Paugam, Henry's lawyer, acidly described as designed to
punish vendors of spoiled mustard. (The indictment of Roux and Netter was
widely considered a maneuver to shield Herve himself.) The four men were
first tried last summer by a panel of judges at Paris's Palace of Justice.
In October 1992 Garretta was sentenced to four years in jail and a heavy
fine. (He lost any hope of clemency when he absconded to Boston before
his sentencing to work as a consultant for a biotech firm.) Roux received
a suspended sentence, Netter was acquitted, and Allain, sentenced to two
years in jail, appealed and was granted a retrial. In an unusual move,
perhaps to satisfy public opinion, which considered the sentence too lenient,
state prosecutors asked that all four men be retried. The object of the
second trial, which began this past May in the Paris Court of Appeals,
was to decide whether the original verdict would be upheld, lessened, or
stiffened. This was still a criminal trial, conducted by state prosecutors.
But in France victims and their lawyers are allowed to put their side of
the story to the court. During the appeal, Paugam and other lawyers representing
hemophiliacs pressed to move the case to the felony court on the tougher
charges of poisoning. If so, additional defendants could be named. The
lawyers have also asked that charges of poisoning be filed against Herve,
Dufoix, and former prime minister Fabius in the HIgh Court of Justice,
the only tribunal in France that can try former ministers for offenses
committed while in office.</P>

<P>As he awaited the outcome of this latest trial, Henry summed up the
legal and ethical issues at stake with the relentless simplicity of a dying
man: &quot;If you're sitting in an office counting boxes of products, you
can talk about marketing,&quot; he said. &quot;But not if you're treating
human beings. If you're a doctor, you don't give people products that can
hurt them.&quot;</P>

<P>Indeed, Garretta didn't just help destroy hundreds of lives; he deeply
damaged the relationship between patient and doctor. &quot;What I most
reproach Garretta for,&quot; Pinon said recently, &quot;is that he created
distrust in the blood system, which is completely built on trust.&quot;
Garretta's performance in the May court hearings did nothing to restore
the French public's faith. Day after day, the haggard former head of the
CNTS tearfully recited the same refrain: &quot;It wasn't possible for me
to decide alone. No one ever said we should do things differently.&quot;
He was a scapegoat, he said, for a common failure of foresight and courage.</P>

<P>Should doctors be better than the rest of us? Why blame Allain, for
example, for staying on at the CNTS and carrying out Garretta's policy?
After all, as he said when interviewed during the trial, &quot;I have four
children of my own, and I need to make a living.&quot; Behind him was a
courtroom packed with anguished parents who used to have children of their
own. Their sons are dead now because men like Garretta and Allain-and no
doubt many others who will never be publicly named-betrayed them.</P>

<P>TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF TALES FROM THE RED PLANET: MARS, UFOs,
AND ANTI-GRAVITY </P>

<P>&quot;The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge
authority as such; for every great advance in natural knowledge has involved
the absolute rejection of authority&quot; T. H. Huxley</P>

<P>As if the moon were not the source of enough mysteries and cover-ups
by NASA and the scientific community, in their apparent attempt to hide
their own &quot;flying saucer&quot; research and other military schemes,
the Red Planet, Mars adds its two bits to the whole bizarre scenario.</P>

<P>Mars has featured in mankind's fantasies and mythology for thousands
of years. The planet itself is named after the Roman god of war (or vice
versa). Jonathan Swift wrote in &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot; in 1726
that astronomers on &quot;Laputa,&quot; the mythical floating land which
also means &quot;prostitute&quot; in spanish, had discovered two swiftly
moving moons on Mars, and provided information on their distances from
Mars and their periods of revolution about Mars. Astonishingly, the moons
of Mars had not been &quot;discovered&quot; yet, and would not be, officially
for another hundred and fifty years of so, though Kepler had surmised before
Swift's time that Mars had two moons. Swift's information on the distances
from the planet and the revolution periods of Mars were two moons. most
Scientists merely pass it off as a &quot;good guess.&quot; This was just
the start of the mystery of the moons of Mars, and of Mars itself. Prior
to 1877, when the moons were seen for the first time, no one (except possibly
Swift) had seen any moons on Mars even through excellent telescopes were
at the disposal of astronomers, easily capable of discerning the moons.
Mars was a popular planet to view, and literally hundreds of astronomers
observed Mars for some time, and even discovered moons on Uranus until
one day Asaph Hall found that Mars had two satellites where none had been
before.</P>

<P>Not only this, but the two Martian satellites moved at very high speeds
and, strangely, traveled in different directions! These and other factors
have led some prominent astronomers to actually put forth the supposition
that the moons are artificial! The Soviet astronomer I.S. Schklovsky, pointed
out that the Martian satellite Phobos exhibits a strange acceleration in
its orbit, an irregularity which would be expected if the satellite were
in reality a huge metallic sphere that was hollow. The same difference
in speed, however, would be impossible for a natural astronomical body.
Therefore, says, Dr. Schklovsky, at least one of the moons of Mars is not
a natural object, but an artificial satellite placed in orbit around the
planet, possibly in 1877, or shortly before that time.</P>

<P>A few years later, astronomers observing Mars began to notice markings
on the planet that seemed to be connected in a system that covered the
whole planet. These markings were dubbed to be &quot;canals&quot; and were
actually thought to be just that by many of the foremost astronomers of
the times. The Italian astronomer Schiaparelli was the first to note the
canals in the early 1890s, and other astronomers began to notice them as
well. The American astronomer Percival Lowell, who built one of the best
observatories in the world in Flagstaff, Arizona, became obsessed with
the canals, drew detailed maps of them and worried that the Martians were
fighting a losing battle to survive on a dying planet.</P>

<P>The &quot;canals&quot; exist, there can be no doubt. Just what they
are, is the question. Considering the great variety of canals on the Martian
surface, it was thought by some scientists that the Martians were trying
to signal us. At one time plans were suggested for planting mid-western
crops in patterns by way of acknowledging the communication. Canals were
seen to wax and wane by astronomers, and would apparently move at times,
confusing everybody.</P>

<P>In the 1910 issue of &quot;Nature,&quot; the astronomer James Worthington
made the comment, after visiting Lowell at his observatory in Flagstaff
(and Lowell was of the outspoken opinion that there was life on Mars and
the canals were of an artificial nature), &quot;As to the deductions which
Dr. Lowell had drawn from his observations I have nothing to say except
that the startlingly artificial and geometrical appearance of the markings
did force itself upon me.&quot;</P>

<P>Flashes of light were frequently seen on Mars and have been called Transient
Martian Phenomena, much like the Transient Lunar Phenomena of the same
nature. While some astronomers interpreted it as signals, others thought
it to be clouds drifting across the surface. One prominent place where
the &quot;projections&quot; (flashes of light) occurred, is the lcarium
Mare, and Percival Lowell stated at the American Philosophical Society
meeting in December 1901, that more han 400 projections seen in the Mare
were clouds reflecting light. Icarium Mare, he said, was undoubtedly a
great tract of vegetation and was given to forming clouds.</P>

<P>As time went on, and Percival Lowell died, other scientists were sure
to make statements that there was no life on Mars, nor any of the other
planets in our solar system. This did not stop the wave of hysteria when
Orson Wells broadcast his Halloween hoax of H.G. Wells' &quot;War Of The
Worlds,&quot; simulating an actual invasion from Mars. After the Viking
1 Orbiter flew by Mars on July 31, 1976 at an altitude of 1,278 miles,
taking picture of the Martian surface, some new and interesting information
suddenly came up in a photograph released and described by NASA only as
&quot;the northern latitudes of Mars.&quot; In the photograph since published
several times in Omni magazine (April, 1982 and March, 1985), as well as
in other journals, a huge rock formation that looks like a face can be
seen in the center of the photo. This rock formation has been measured
as one mile across. NASA claims that it is an illusion caused by the angel
of the sun.</P>

<P>Furthermore, to the left of the photo are two rock formations which
appear to be pyramidical in shape. They are clearly throwing out triangular
shadows. Parallel lines, looking like perfectly straight runways or roads
appear in the upper left hand portion on the photo. According to Jim Safran
of Lunar Photos in Van Nuys, California, these markings appear in quite
a few of the Viking Mars photos. Oddly, these artificial-looking markings
have been cropped out of the photos that appeared in Omni magazine and
are not mentioned at all.</P>

<P>Fortunately, two computer scientists who work for Computer Science Technicolor
Associates, of Seabrook, Maryland, a company that does contract work for
NASA, noticed the photos, and decided to analyze them themselves. The scientists,
Vincent DiPietro and Greg Molenaar concluded that the face in the photos,
taken of the Elysian Plains, would &quot;appear to have been carved rather
than formed by nature,&quot; as there is no surrounding sediment that could
have resulted from natural erosion, as NASA claimed.</P>

<P>They furthermore concluded that the face was truly symmetrical (they
were using computer enhanced photos to make their detailed analysis). It
had two halves, each containing an &quot;eye,&quot; a &quot;cheek&quot;
and an appropriate continuation of the &quot;mouth.&quot; They even discovered
what resembles an eyeball with a visible pupil in the eye socket. They
also discovered that there was a second NASA photograph of the &quot;Face
in Space,&quot; as it has been dubbed, and that it was just an illusion
caused by the angle of the sun on a natural formation.</P>

<P>The whole affair got even sticker when a science writer who was a friend
of DiPietro and Molenaar, named Richard Hoagland, got original copies of
the photos and then claimed to have found, in the same photo, a &quot;lost
civilization on Mars&quot; (Omni, Vol 7 No. 6, March, 1985)! They had turned
their attentions to the pyramidical features to the west of the face, and
to the grid-like pattern of rectilinear markings like the layout of a city
in the shadows of the upper pyramid. He also spotted a series of right
angles contributing to an overall impression of a main avenue leading toward
the face.</P>

<P>Hoagland discovered that this main &quot;avenue&quot; seems to be aligned
in a special way with the face, which itself runs along a northeast-southeast
axis with the Martian poles. Back then, a person standing in the center
of the &quot;city,&quot; gazing east over the face, would be sighting along
a solstice alignment; that is, seeing the sun rise directly over the face
on the longest day of the Martian year. Hoagland surmised that for 50,000
years, the first summer sun of the year would have risen above the face.
Later, as the planet tilted, the alignment of the solstice viewing would
have passed right through the top of the pyramid as well.</P>

<P>The honeycomb like tracery that exists in the shadow of the pyramid
could be optical &quot;glitches&quot; caused by the photo-enhancing process.
Yet, these walls cast shadows, and DiPietro and Molenaar claim they did
not get these kinds of glitches with enhancements of aerial photos taken
here on Earth. The grid spacing suspiciously resembles that of real city
streets, and the layout is aligned toward the winter solstice sunrise.
An architect friend of Hoagland's calculated the buildings would have been
oriented in a manner that would best use the scant winter warmth of the
shortest day of the Martian year. Incredibly, the senior scientist with
the U.S. Geological Survey and one of the world's leading experts on Martian
geology, a man who headed the NASA group in charge of selecting the sites
where the Viking landers set down, Harold Masursky, told Omni magazine,
&quot;If you're going to say features like that are evidence for a past
civilization, that's total nonsense. I'm working on finding landing sites
for a possible Mars Rover. And this (the city on Mars) is not one of the
areas where I would send what is probably a thirty-billion dollar mission.
In fact, if somebody bought us a free one, I'm not sure I'd send it there
because there are too many other places that are more interesting.&quot;
Is Masursky a blind idiot, or is he toeing the party line, so to speak?
He is probably not an idiot, and considering the startling finds of NASA
on the Moon, and their many secret projects and coverups, it is not surprising
that he would make such statements. Either masursky is on the periphery
of NASA knowledge, and actually believes that there is nothing worth viewing
at this &quot;Martian City&quot; (it would be interesting to hear his comments
of UFOs), or he is naturally trying to avert attention from this startling
find and cover up what may even be a &quot;live city&quot; as opposed to
a &quot;dead&quot; one. Interestingly, a book published in 1978 by Avon
books in the United States, and which originally appeared as a BBC special
in Britain, called &quot;Alternative 3&quot; (by Leslie Watkins, David
Ambrose and Christopher Miles) was reportedly an investigation into the
disappearance of scientists in Britain and the United States. According
to the book, these scientists were being send to Mars(!) by NASA to work
in secret cities there, in an effort to create a habitual climate on Mars
(which included melting the polar ice caps and building dome-cities on
the planet). The reason, the book stated, was that NASA was doing this
because the Earth's atmosphere is becoming super-heated and unbreathable.
Life was doomed on earth; therefore, a secret conspiracy, involving most
of the world's governments (including the U.S.S.R.) were working to move
a certain portion of mankind to Mars.</P>

<P>According to the book, the first manned landing on Mars took place in
the early 1960s, and Mars Bases were begun shortly afterwards. Anti-gravity
spaceships were used to shuttle scientists and &quot;brainwashed,&quot;
kidnapped, slave-workers to the bases to work. There was a lunar staging
base in a crater on the moon.</P>

<P>While the book made some impact on UFO and conspiracy buffs, and was
written in a matter-of-fact style and purported to be an investigative
book, it was in fact an April Fool's Day television special done for the
BBC that was never aired on April Fool's Day because of a television strike
in Britain. When it was finally aired, straight-faced, some months later,
most people did not realize that is was an April Fool's joke. It was later
published in Britain and the United States in book form as &quot;science
fact,&quot; also on April Fool's Day. An interesting story, it is however
quite unlikely, considering the difficulty that both the Soviets and the
Americans had in just landing space probes on the moon in the early sixties,
much less Mars. Even if NASA possessed anti-gravity vehicles at that time,
it seems unlikely that they would have been flying them to Mars while laughingly
flinging Rangers at the Moon. Furthermore, the author, British journalist
Leslie Watkins has come right out and said that the whole book was a hoax.
Yet still, many UFO buffs believe it as fact.</P>

<P>One does wonder, though, if NASA has visited Mars yet in one of its
supposed &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; craft? It seems unlikely. They are far
too busy preparing for nuclear war and setting up presumed bases on the
Moon. With all the UFOs out there (especially on the Moon, if reports are
to be believed), and their occasional interference in the NASA space program,
NASA may consider it too dangerous to take a manned flight to Mars.</P>

<P>One cannot help but think that there was certainly life on Mars in the
past, if not now. Are some UFOs from Mars? Perhaps they are little green
men, busy mining our Moon without a permit, exploiting Earth's God-given
natural resources, much as huge multi-national companies and western powers
have been doing to underdeveloped nations here on earth.</P>

<P>Still more disturbing are the many reports of captured alien craft and
even aliens, by the U.S. Government. In the book, Clear Intent: The Government
Coverup of the UFO Experience, by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood,
they catalog a great deal of evidence for what they term a massive coverup
of UFO data and even captured UFOs that have either crash landed or been
shot down by the airforce.</P>

<P>They relate one interesting story about a &quot;crashed&quot; UFO in
the Pacific that happened in 1973. An unidentified Naval Intelligence officer
tells how, while stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Base in Chicago, he
was the Officer of the Guard and was asked to take a sealed message to
the Commander inside a highly restricted quonset hut at the northwestern
end of the base. He had been told that there was highly top secret material
inside. Normally the OD would come to the door, but was busy that night
so he was allowed inside. This was highly unusual.</P>

<P>&quot;As I went to the doorway, where the OD was, I saw a very highly
unusual craft over to my left. The craft was possibly thirty to thirty-five
feet long, about twelve to fifteen feet at its thickest part; then it tapered
off in the front to a teardrop shape. I only caught it at an angular view.
It looked like it did not have any seams to it. It had a bluish tint, but
that was only if you looked at it for a few seconds.&quot; As the officer
turned to leave, he got another look at it, &quot;At this time I had a
very good view about halfway from the craft to the tail section. The whole
craft tapered back to a very high edge. It looked as if it had a razor
sharp edge. The bottom went about three quarters the length of the craft
and then angled sharply upward.&quot; The craft sat on a frame made out
of four by four wooden blocks, with crossbeams under it, so that it was
sitting one or two feet off the floor.</P>

<P>Later, the Intelligence Officer was in San Diego talking to some crew
members of a destroyer who said that they had tangled with an unidentified
craft. The destroyer had show down the craft while heading from San Diego
to Hawaii in 1973 with a surface to air missile, but did not destroy it.
It sank in about 350 feet of water. The Glomar Explorer was used to extract
the craft and it was sent by rail to Chicago. When the crew member drew
a picture of the unidentified craft, it matched perfectly the craft that
the Intelligence Officer had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Base.</P>

<P>One interesting incident reported in 1981 by many newspapers as well
as OMNI and other magazines, was the case of three Texas school teachers
who saw a &quot;flying saucer&quot; was an Army helicopter, which landed
at the crash site. The ladies, all middle-aged, and respectable, reported
their sightings to the police. Then, a few days later, all three of the
women los all the hair on their heads! They had apparently gotten a dose
of radiation!</P>

<P>This case does not appear to be one of an alien ship, but rather an
unsuccessful test of an experimental U.S. military craft. Other tales of
crashed UFOs appear in many books; the most famous is probably &quot;the
Roswell Incident,&quot; detailed by Charles Berlitz in the book, &quot;The
Roswell Incident&quot;. While many of the stories appear rather fanciful
in nature, and most &quot;kidnapping&quot; stories appear to be utter bunk,
one can not discount the possibility that the U.S. and other governments
have captured a UFO</P>

<P>San Francisco Chronicle Monday, September 16, 1985</P>

<P>TYPED BY: The P/\NTHER TRSI-UMF U.S. Contesting Lawsuit Over UFO Radiation.</P>

<P>Houston</P>

<P>Three people suing the federal government for $20 million say they do
not know to this day what it was that hovered far over their heads and
zapped them with radiation almost five years ago.</P>

<P>They claim it was an unidentified flying object that was escorted away
by military helicopters. They say they suspect it was a secret U.S. military
experiment. In any event, they say, the government should have warned residents
that a UFO was in their area.</P>

<P>The military says it had nothing to do with the alleged occurrence Dec.
29, 1980, on a rural road northeast of Houston. Even if there were UFOs,
a U.S. attorney says, the government has no duty to warn people about them
because the government does not know whether they are dangerous.</P>

<P>With such straightforward arguments, the government is urging U.S. District
Judge Ross Sterling to throw out a lawsuit filed year by former Dayton,
Texas cafe owner Betty Cash, 56, former waitress Vickie Landrum, 61, and
Landrum's grandson, Colby Landrum, 11.</P>

<P>The suit claims that about 9 p.m. on Dec. 29, 1980 while headed for
their homes in Dayton along a two -lane road about 30 miles northeast of
Houston, the three encountered a brightly glowing craft the size of a city
water tower. It hovered at treetop level, had red and orange flames flowing
from its bottom, and bathed them in intense heat for several minutes before
it was escorted away by at least 23 helicopters, they assert.</P>

<P>Their lawsuit, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claims that
the government failed to warn them of the UFO and &quot;negligently, carelessly
and recklessly&quot; allowed it &quot;to fly over a publicly used road
and come in contact with the plaintiffs.&quot;</P>

<P>As a result, all suffered stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation
burns, deteriorating eyesight, and the women's hair fell out and grew back
with a different texture, the suit claims. It also says that they became
highly sensitive to sunlight, suffered blisters and headaches, and that
Cash developed breast cancer.</P>

<P>Despite the plaintiffs report that there were no markings on the &quot;large,
unconventional aerial object&quot; or on the helicopters, the lawsuit has
recently moved from simply suggesting that the government merely knew about
the UFO to saying that the government owned the UFO.</P>

<P>The government has offered affidavits from high-ranking officials that
it had nothing to do with the UFO. -Dallas Times Herald</P>

whenever&quot; Sun. Come join us... -Show the military that we value this
land and will fight their attempts to take it -See,from legal viewpoint,
the big military base that the government does not acknowledge. -Visit
the newly discovered public vantage point, Freedom Ridge, offering an even
better view of the base. -Help mark trails and improve the area for future
hikers and campers. -Camp under the stars and enjoy the desert.</P>

<P>This is an informal&quot;bring your own everything&quot; event. There
sill be no protests confrontations or storming of the gates. All courtesies
and laws will be respected. Come with your backpack and sleeping bag and
have a good time. Activities and camping will center on White Sides peak,
a 1-12 hour hike from the road</P>

<P>Loosely organized activities will include... -An MPE cookout. Bring
your own Meal-Ready-to Eat, either an official military one (available
at army-navy stores), or a comparably bland substitute of your own making.
-A marshmallow toast on the Mount. Mallows provided, but bring some firewood
if you can, as this is scarce in the desert. -A semi-organized hike along
border. -Industrious SECRET PROJECTS.Bring work gloves. -Sky watching,
base viewing and flying saucer hunting. Bring binoculars or telescope if
you have them.</P>

<P>Details: The camp-out will be either pleasantly intimate or the Groom
Range &quot;Woodstock&quot; depending on how many people come. We will
meet at noon at the White-Side Trail head. If you can't arrive by noon,
then come whenever you can. Expect a rigorous high-altitude hike (from
5000 up to 6000 feet) but most people can make it. If they take their time.</P>

<P>Daytime temperatures here are usually very pleasant in the fall, but
afternoons can be windy and nights can be cold-often close to freezing.
Unless you have a cold weather sleeping bag, consider bringing two summer
ones; to use one inside the other.</P>

<P>You sill also need a foam pad to sleep on-The ground is rocky- and a
camp shovel can be useful to make a flat place for yourself. Tents are
not practical on the Mount, although you could use them back near the trailhead.
(Merit badges are awarded only to people who spend the whole night on the
mountain) Rain is unlikely, but should it occur call the secretary at the
number below for more information, awarded only to people who spend the
whole night on the mountain). Rain is unlikely, but should it occur, call
the secretary at the number below for more information.</P>

<P>Recommended Items: Backpack, sleeping bat (or two) foam pad, food for
3-4 meals sturdy hiking shoes, flashlight, hat gloves and warm clothing

telescope, camp shovel.work gloves, MRE,space blankets, kids. We ask that
you NOT bring: Beer pr amy other alcohol, drugs or anything illegal, firearms.</P>

<P>Ground rules: (1) Be aware of where the Restricted Area border is and
do not and do not cross it. (The border is clearly marked by signs or every
dirt road and by orange posts in the desert). (2) Be aware that the military
is very sensitive about photography of their secret base. (See signs upon
arrival). If you choose to bring a camera or videocamera, keep it out of
sight. (3) It is illegal to park or camp within 100 yards of the water
trough at the White Sides Trail head. Alternate parking will be provided.
(4) Carry in, carry out. (5) Watch for cattle as you drive, range is unfenced.
(6) Please respect the rancher's privacy. Do not approach the ranch compound
(7) You are responsible for your own safety, the organizers of this camp-out
accept no liability for any injury or damages. (8)Please respect the land
and mind your manners.</P>

<P>In the event of a Land Seizure: The military wants to take the mountain
because it overlooks their secret Groom base, home of the Black Budget
aircraft and many still active Cold War weapons programs. Since The move
to take White Sides has already been initiated in Washington. It is possible
that a new land grab could take place before the date of the camp-out.
You can be sure, in that case, that guards will be posted and that the
new claims will be clearly marked. If the military does take White Sides,
then the camp-out will proceed as scheduled, but with a new agenda and
a different set of activities.</P>

<P>Meet at noon Saturday at the closest accessible point to White Sides.</P>

<P>PURPOSE</P>

<P>The Police Officers, National Guardsmen and military officers who have
contributed to this special publication are aware of a plan to overthrow
the Constitutional Republic of these United States of America.</P>

<P>This publication, many months in preparation, was found difficult to
compile for many reasons. One important reason was that none of the officers
involved were pleased with the duty of bringing to the attention of our
colleagues the names and activities of some in our nation who have been
in the past (or presently) engaged in what can only be described by law
as treason and/or sedition against their own government. While detailing
the plan of these Internationalists, the main goal of this special police
publication will be to promote an active program that will defend America
from those at work forming an oligarchy of Imperialism against this nation
of free people. The herein described plan to halt this unAmerican activity
can succeed only with the combined efforts of the People's Protectors (the
Police, Guardsmen and Military) and their countrymen in the private sector.</P>

<P><A NAME="-2-"></A>-2-</P>

<P>TREASON AND SEDITION</P>

<P>DEFINITIONS In defining &quot;treason&quot; and &quot;sedition&quot;
we look to the Fifth edition of Black's Law Dictionary, pg. 1345, and pg.
1218</P>

<P>TREASON: Thee offense of attempting by covert acts to overthrow the
government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance; or of betraying
the state into the hands of a foreign power.</P>

<P>SEDITION: ...knowingly becoming a member of any organization which advocates
the overthrow or reformation of the existing form of government of this
state by violence or unlawful means.</P>

<P>The facts and information about some of the persons and their actions
listed in this special report is prima facie evidence of their long involvement
in activities directly designed to covertly overthrow the lawful, constitutional
government of the United States of America. These individuals thus hope
to deliver the People of the U.S. into the hands of a foreign power known
as the United Nations, which is in actuality an oligarchy of the world's
super rich, who have no allegiance to any one nation and who control the
U.N. from behind the scenes.</P>

<P>As the reader will find, many of these persons are, or have been, members
of various organizations that have as their purpose the destruction of
this Constitutional Republic.</P>

<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all of the people listed in this report are involved
in treason and sedition against the United States. Some of the individuals
listed and quoted are presenting evidence of these crimes committed by
others or are listed/quoted for informational purposes only.</P>

<P>As patriotic Americans of all races, religions and political beliefs,
we claim our right to defend our Republic from all enemies foreign and
domestic. This educational work is one such attempt.</P>

<P><A NAME="-3-"></A>-3-</P>

<P>THE NEW AGE/NEW WORLD GOVERNMENT PLAN</P>

<P>Many of our Nation's INTERNAL PROTECTORS know of the well-laid plan
which will culminate before the year 2000, to usher the United States,
along with the rest of the nations of the world, into a &quot;utopian&quot;
global community allegedly under the control of a &quot;philanthropic&quot;
United Nations. A great many of our fellow Officers and National Guardsmen
are taking a stand against this plan because they realize that their fellow
Americans were never allowed to know of this plan nor given the opportunity
to vote on such a change in their government. In addition, the officers
are concerned patriots and realize that this plan of world domination is
injurious in the extreme, and a total fraud perpetrated against the people
of the world!</P>

<P>This publication outlines the plan of these American Internal Protectors
which they believe will stop this diabolical agenda.</P>

<P>THE NEW ORDER</P>

<P>Allegedly this new order is being set up to save THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD
from a whole variety of &quot;imminent&quot; life and world-threatening
disasters. Of those sworn protectors of the people that are aware of this
global scheme, few realize that the actual behind-the-scenes plan is for
an oligarchy of the world's richest families to place 1/2 the masses of
the earth in servitude under their complete control, administered from
behind the false front of the United Nations. To facilitate management
capabilities, the plan calls for the elimination of the other 2.5 billion
people through war, disease, abortion and famine by the year 2000. As we
can plainly see, their plan for &quot;Population Control&quot; (reduction)
is well established and under way.</P>

<P>WORLD GOVERNMENT PLAN: ALIEN TROOPS TO POLICE U.S.A.</P>

<P>Officers who think they will be at home watching their own children
and spouses are wrong. Once the NWO is set up in the year 2000 (just a
couple of years away) you, officer, guardsman, and soldiers, will be in
other countries (listed below). Foreign police troops will be guarding
and enslaving your spouses and children in U.S.A. Here is the plan-</P>

<P>See Picture #1 for map</P>

<P>United States troops to be stationed:</P>

<P>Region 12. Australia</P>

<P>Region 32 Uruguay, Argentina</P>

<P>Region 55 Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria</P>

<P>Region 58 Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia</P>

<P>Region 75 India, Nepal, Blutan, Tibet, E. Pakistan</P>

<P>Region 85 Kazak SSR, Turkmen, Uzbeg, Tadzhik, Kirghiz SSR</P>

for World Government, shows what alien troops would occupy and police the
six regions into which the United States and Canada would be divided.</P>

<P>The ruling body or World Parliament would consist only of appointed
members. It would reflect population strengths: so Asia would dominate
it.</P>

<P>There would be a World Director. 8 zone directors and 51 regional directors.
None of the zone or regional directors would ever serve in their own countries.
So an alien would command troops stationed in the U.S. and through them
enforce World Government law, and prevent Americans from &quot;sheltering
behind national allegiance.&quot;</P>

<P>OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000</P>

<P>Our OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 plan invokes the awakening (education)
of our fellow officers to the extreme need for them to take an immediate
and active role in assisting their fellow Americans in stopping this plan
for world dominion, using every lawful means available.</P>

<P>HUMAN PARASITES</P>

<P>These elitists and their families have made most of their massive fortunes
off the American people, and have dedicated entire lifetimes to using public
funds to subjugate the People to the will of their new world ARISTOCRACY.</P>

<P>This special police officer publication is a private endeavor, and is
dedicated to those sworn Protectors of the People who refuse to play a
role in enslaving their countrymen. We are proud of these brave Officers
who are presently assisting other patriotic Americans of all races and
creeds in halting this program for world dominion called the</P>

<P>NEW AGE/NEW WORLD ORDER.</P>

<P>Some of our Police/National Guardsmen readers suggested names for this
private police action plan. Our government, to maintain privacy in its
activities, has long been in the practice of choosing unusual names for
covert operations, such as &quot;Transylvania &amp; Co.&quot;, &quot;Garden
Plot&quot;, &quot;Operation Zapata&quot;, &quot;Thunder Muffin, Inc.&quot;,
&quot;Operation Watch Tower&quot;, and &quot;Cable Splicer&quot;, to name
a few. We Officers, while in the alternative, desiring the greatest amount
of publicity about our plan of attack against these anti-American types,
likewise have chosen a cute little name for our off-duty, First Amendment
POLICE ACTION. That name is:</P>

<P>OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000!</P>

<P>-5-</P>

<P>It is felt that this name reflects the actual program in which officers
are involved, designed to stop or &quot;kill off&quot; the ongoing, elitist,
covert operation which has been installed in the American system with great
stealth and cunning. They, the Globalists, have stated that the date of
termination of the American way of life is the year 2000. Therefore it
is fitting that our date to terminate, at the very least; their plan, is
also the year 2000.</P>

<P>LET IT BE WELL UNDERSTOOD, WE PROTECTORS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE
NOT ASKED FOR THIS BATTLE. IT IS OUR NATION'S ENEMIES WHO HAVE BROUGHT
THIS FIGHT TO THE VERY DOOR OF EVERY GOOD AMERICAN.</P>

<P>BE IT RESOLVED:</P>

<P>* Our prayer and promise is to do all within our power, as faithful
countrymen, to overthrow this evil, treasonous plan in a completely non-violent,
lawful manner.</P>

<P>* Our sworn duty is to protect the people of this nation and its constitutional,
republican form of government from any enemy that would come against it.</P>

<P>* Our pledge is that WE WILL, BY EVERY MEANS GIVEN TO UNTO US, UPHOLD
OUR OATHS AND FULFILL OUR SWORN DUTY TO OUR COUNTRYMEN.</P>

<P>PUTTING THE STAKE THROUGH DRACULA'S HEART</P>

<P>WHAT CAN WE DO, WHAT SHOULD WE DO? The Globalists' agenda is a diabolical
program which, through patient gradualism, is slowly draining the moral,
economic and political life blood from the United States and the hard working
American people.</P>

<P>We in America, Officers and private citizens alike, are fortunate that
at this moment in our history we can still LAWFULLY EXTERMINATE these parasitic
Global Blood Suckers by placing numerous &quot;STAKES&quot; made of words,
paper, pen, and hard work through their hardened hearts.</P>

<P>-6-</P>

<P>EVIDENTIARY FOUNDATION</P>

<P>Presented here are often-used, famous quotes and statements which will
make for easy reference for those who wish to use them to educate our fellow
officers, National Guardsmen and military, or the private sector. As the
reader will see, most of these statements have been around for many decades
and are known by those who study history and the machinations of megalomaniacs
known today as Globalists. Most are not new revelations, but just the opposite;
however, few will ever be found in the controlled press. There are literally
thousands of such well-worn statements about the coming world government.
We have selected some of the very best and well known.</P>

<P>INVESTIGATOR'S NOTE: As the investigator will notice not all of the
quotes are documented as to date and place of utterance. This will trouble
some. If this is a problem to the reader, he should either eliminate those
quotes, or consider, as police investigators do, the great preponderance
of evidence pointing toward any given hypothesis! In addition, as in other
investigations, sometimes the investigator must look at the results to
accurately check the validity of the information one is receiving. This
is to say, that may times we must look to see if what the statement purported
would occur, ACTUALLY OCCURRED, in order to check and see if the original
information received was valid. As the investigator will recognize, this
is the same process used by law enforcement in proving the reliability
of a Confidential Informant (CI). The reader will readily see that what
the undocumented statements listed in this publication exposed, or stated
would occur in the future, has either occurred, or is in the process of
taking place today. Therein lies the proof of the validity of the original
statements and why they were chosen to be included in this publication.</P>

<P>FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES</P>

<P>FROM THEIR WORKS YOU WILL KNOW THEM. Here are their words and works,
and some very important evidence (STAKES) to use and expose and &quot;kill
off&quot; the World Government Vampires in our society. In addition to
this are included other pertinent materials (government maps, etc.) all
of which revealed other parts of the same treasonous operation.</P>

<P>With these facts in hand, our nation's internal protectors, police and
National Guardsmen, will be able to alert even the most hard-headed of
our colleagues to understand that: VERY SOON, IF WE DO NOT STOP THESE WORLD
GOVERNMENT PROPONENTS, AND INSTALL IN PLACES OF LEADERSHIP HONORABLE MEN
AND WOMEN, ALL MILITARY, NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS OF THE LAW WILL
BE USED</P>

<P>-7-</P>

<P>AS THE &quot;ENFORCEMENT ARM&quot; TO GUARANTEE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF
&quot;VOLUNTEERS&quot; FOR THESE IMPERIALISTS' &quot;PEACEFUL&quot; SOCIALIST
GLOBAL SOCIETY.</P>

<P>EXPOSURE IS THE DEATH KNELL OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER</P>

<P>Investigating Officers always must demand proof of a crime. No assumption
can stand alone. Here are the confessions right from the mouths of these
parasites of liberty. Once armed with this information, our PLAN is simply
for each Officer to take this publication, make copies of it (or order
more copies) and pass them out ASAP to every Police Officer and National
Guardsman he knows. All officers, for their own welfare, and in order to
be of assistance, need these facts. Keep in mind that these global government
Blood Suckers, just like the old movie Vampires, must do their dirty deeds
in darkness. The purpose of this publication is to bring that darkness
to light! If we do this, the only other activity we &quot;Police Against
the New World Order&quot; need apply is to UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OFFICE. In
other words, our duty is to protect the people and their rights under the
U.S. and State Constitutions.</P>

<P>We welcome every Internal Protector that loves liberty and has taken
an oath &quot;to protect our U.S&gt; Constitution and the freedoms of their
fellow countrymen&quot;, to join us in</P>

<P>SAYING &quot;NO&quot; TO THE NEW WORLD ORDER.</P>

<P><A NAME="-8-"></A>-8-</P>

<P>WHAT &quot;NEW WORLD&quot; ?</P>

<P>Man's desire to rule the world is as old as his presence on earth. The
&quot;New&quot; World Order is actually the same old plan for world domination.
Biblical history itself shows this to be true. The Tower of Babel was one
such futile attempt by men to set up a ONE WORLD SOCIETY without God. And
God Himself crushed it. Satan tempted even Jesus, promising Him world dominion
as His reward. This same promise has been given to scores of other men
over the ages. History tells of many who have accepted the Great Deceiver's
terms. This diabolical quest has continued on through the 19th Century
and into the 20th, with national and world figures each successively making
plans for world rule. Listed here are but a few of such statements from
many past decades up to the present.</P>

<P>HOW SHALL WE KNOW?</P>

<P>Some among us ask, &quot;How shall we know when tyranny has come to
America's door?&quot; There are very few answers that our Founding Fathers
failed to leave us regarding the proper and improper role of government.
Here is the answer to the question of how we shall recognize tyranny:</P>

<P>&quot;SINGLE ACTS OF TYRANNY MAY BE ASCRIBED TO THE ACCIDENTAL OPINION
OF A DAY; BUT A SERIES OF OPPRESSIONS, BEGUN AT A DISTINGUISHED PERIOD,
AND PURSUED UNALTERABLY THROUGH EVERY CHANGE OF MINISTERS (ADMINISTRATIONS),
TOO PLAINLY PROVES A DELIBERATE, SYSTEMATIC PLAN OF REDUCING US TO SLAVERY.&quot;
- Thomas Jefferson. (Has tyranny come to America?)</P>

<P>Another of our Founders said - &quot;WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FEARS THE PEOPLE
THERE IS LIBERTY; WHEN THE PEOPLE FEAR THE GOVERNMENT THERE IS TYRANNY&quot;.
(There is no question at this time in our history that Americans fear their
government.)</P>

<P>THE FAMOUS &amp; INFAMOUS-QUOTES</P>

<P>Like the legendary Vampire Dracula lays claim to his victims, the Globalist
slowly drains the essence of life and liberty from our Land. While it may
be surprising to some, we will begin this overview of U.S. treason and
debauchery with America's current, number one proponent of world conquest,
President George Bush:</P>

<P>GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, President of U.S., CFR Director, Trilateralist,
&quot;Lip-reader&quot;, CIA Director. Bush, one moonlit night in 1948 at
Yale University, crawled naked into a coffin. With 15 brother &quot;Bonesmen&quot;
(as they call one another) encircling him, he told personal tales of debauchery,
took an occult oath, was raised (&quot;born-again&quot;) as a MAN-GOD,
jumped into a pile of mud, thus joining the occult, elitist Skull &amp;
Bones Society. He, indeed, is still a &quot;Boner&quot; today.</P>

<P>See Picture 2.</P>

<P>Bush spoke before Congress on Sept. 11, 1990, delivering a speech which
he entitled &quot;Toward a New World Order&quot;. Addressing the subject
of his Gulf War, he made his first public utterance of his, and his rich
cronies' plans for a world imperialism in stating that the war against
Iraq was &quot;...a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period
of cooperation. Out of these troubled times... a new world order can emerge.&quot;</P>

<P>-10-</P>

<P>Let us take a moment to compare the statements of the &quot;Father of
our Republic&quot; with those of Internationalist George &quot;Boner&quot;
Bush:</P>

<P>&quot;The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations,
is in extending our commercial relations to have as little political connection
as possible.&quot; &quot;...Why, by interweaving our destiny with that
of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of
European ambition, rivalships, interest, humor, or caprice?&quot; &quot;...It
is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion
of the foreign world.&quot; - George Washington, September 19, 1796. (Which
George should we follow?)</P>

<P>Bush has given his New World Order (NWO) pep talks at least 20 times
over the last two years for various groups around the world. Space does
not allow us to list all of these treasonous discourses; however, several
more are listed further on in this report.</P>

<P>NOTE: DON'T MISTAKE THIS &quot;BUSH BASHING&quot; AS ANTI-REPUBLICANISM!</P>

<P>Many of our Officers are deeply involved in either the Socialistic Republican
Party of the Socialist Democratic Party. Both parties have played a large
part in setting America on the course toward 3rd World Nation status. Bill
Clinton's goals are identical to Bush's - - A New World Order Imperialism.
Perot's ideas for government are also pro-Globalism.</P>

<P>We can give Bush credit that his recent unabashed utterance of his dream
of a New World Order served to awaken at least a few slumbering Americans.
These Americans now understand that, what was long planned and covertly
implemented, is well on its way to fruition. Some will remember historical
accounts of other megalomaniacs of the past who acted upon similar global
ambitions. Several of the following are relatively recent examples:</P>

<P>ADAM WISEHOPHF, professor at Germany 's Ingolstadt University, founded
The Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776. This man designed the very
plan of world domination that is still in use today to enslave the world's
masses. Here, upon establishing his &quot;Order of the Illuminati&quot;,
he smugly reflects on his &quot;conning&quot; the gullible Christians of
his day, saying:</P>

<P>&quot;The most wonderful thing of all is that the distinguished Lutheran
and Calvinist theologians who belong to our order really believe that they
see it in (Illuminati) the true and genuine sense of Christian religion.
Oh mortal man, is there anything you cannot be made to believe?</P>

<P>-11-</P>

<P>Evidently not! And a high percentage of Christians today are still being
conned in the same way. One prime example of this are the millions of Christians,
and most church denominations, who have fallen for the NWO plan of a &quot;One
World RELIGION&quot;, being spearheaded by the United Nations' National
and World Counsel of Churches, behind the battle cry of ecumenicalism.</P>

<P>Watch the future and we will see only small groups of spiritual Americans,
who will resist following the millions of &quot;religious&quot; lambs to
slaughter. The Lord of the Bible always warned His people to never follow
the MULTITUDE.</P>

<P>WORLD &amp; NATIONAL LEADERS POINT THE WAY</P>

<P>Let us continue with statements from those who over the last few generations
have recognized the One World conspiracy.</P>

<P>BENJAMIN DISRAELI, Prime Minister of England, was attributed with this
statement in 1844: &quot;The world is governed by very different personages
from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.&quot;</P>

<P>WINSTON CHURCHILL, Prime Minister of England, stated to the London press
in 1922: &quot;From the days of Sparticus, Wisehophf, Karl Marx, Trotski,
Belacoon, Rosa Luxenberg, and Ema Goldman, this world conspiracy has been
steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in
the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every
subversive movement during the 19th century. And now at last this band
of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities
of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their
head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.&quot;</P>

<P>JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER, U.S. Supreme Court Justice: &quot;The real
rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes.&quot;</P>

<P>JOHN F. HYLAN, Mayor of New York 1918-1925, said &quot;The real menace
of our Republic is the invisible government which like a giant octopus
sprawls its slimy legs over our cities states and nation.&quot;</P>

<P>FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, U.S. President, in a letter written Nov. 21,
1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House, Roosevelt states: &quot;The real truth
of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large
centers has owned the government of the U.S. since</P>

<P>-12-</P>

<P>the days of Andrew Jackson.&quot; (History points to the last truly
honorable and incorruptible American president as Andrew Jackson &quot;Old
Hickory&quot;.)</P>

<P>ROWAN GAITHER, President of the Ford Foundation, in 1954 lends proof
to what we know to be fact today, namely that many of our Presidents have
been a knowing part of this World Conquest plot. Mr. Gaither stated to
Congressional Reese Commission investigator Norman Dodd: &quot;We operate
here under directives which emulate from the White House...The substance
of the directives under which we operate is that we shall use our grant
making power to alter life in the United States so that we can comfortably
be merged with the Soviet Union.&quot; (Ike was President at that time.)</P>

<P>CARROLL QUIGLEY, Professor of History at Georgetown University, member
of the CFR (one of the U.S. organizations dedicated to World Government)
stated in his book &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;: &quot;The Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) is the American Branch of a society which originated in
England... (and)...believes national boundaries should be obliterated and
one-world-rule established.&quot; (Professor Quigley, according to his
book, was totally dedicated to the One World Government program. Hundreds
of our City, State and National politicians are members of this and other
NWO groups. Governor Clinton, for example, attended Georgetown U. and stated
that his mentor, Professor Q, taught him so many wonderful things. Since
Gov. Clinton and his wife are totally dedicated, International Socialists
and NWO promoters, perhaps Prof. Q. did have a great affect!)</P>

<P>BARRY GOLDWATER, U.S. Senator (Arizona) in his book &quot;WITH NO APOLOGIES&quot;,
stated this about another Globalist group: &quot;The Trilateral Commission
is international (and) is intended to be the vehicle for multinational
consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control
of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission
represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate
the four centers of power- POLITICAL, MONETARY, INTELLECTUAL, AND ECCLESIASTICAL.&quot;</P>

<P>PETER HOAGLAND, Nebraska State Senator and Humanist, speaking on radio
in 1983 with the great American Pastor and Patriot Everett Sileven said:
&quot;Fundamental, Bible-believing people do not have the right to indoctrinate
their children in their religious beliefs because we, the state, are preparing
them for the year 2000, when America will be part of a one-world global
society and their children will not fit in.&quot;</P>

<P>-13-</P>

<P>DAVID ROCKEFELLER, Internationalist billionaire, Humanist, CFR kingpin,
founder of the Trilateral Commission, World Order Godfather (and in all
probability the High School graduate voted &quot;Most Likely to Be Hanged
for Treason&quot;), voiced his praise of the controlled U.S. media for
keeping their oath not to divulge the Globalist plans to the public. Speaking
to his fellow conspirators at a meeting, June 1991 in Baden Baden, Germany,
of yet one more infamous World Order group, the Bilderbergers, Mr. Rockerfeller
said:</P>

<P>&quot;We are grateful to the Washington Post, The New York Times, Time
Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our
meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years.&quot;</P>

<P>He went on to explain:</P>

<P>&quot;It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the
world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those
years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards
a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite
and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination
practiced in past centuries&quot;.</P>

<P>(It is not reported if the attendees kissed his ring - or anything else
- after their leader bestowed his blessing on those in attendance). Actually,
we could ask Governor Clinton or Dan Quayle, both of whom were there. Bush
and Clinton are Bilderbergers, Internationalists, and their goals are exactly
the same for America.</P>

<P>Let us repeat... CLINTON'S, BUSH'S, AND PEROT'S, PLANS FOR AMERICA ARE
VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL. The Republicans and Democrats goals for America are
virtually identical. They both are taking our nation into global government.</P>

<P>Globalist Mr. Dan Quayle was there at the June 91 meeting being sized
up as a possible Bilderberger U.S. Presidential contender for 1996. The
major media's job is to convince Americans that the Republicans and Democrats
are on opposite sides and fighting each other.</P>

<P><A NAME="-14-"></A>-14-</P>

<P>JAMES PAUL WARBURG, Foreign Agent of the Rothchild Dynasty, major player
in the Federal Reserve Act scam: on February 17, 1950, while speaking before
the United States Senate, this pompous Internationalist boasted confidently,
&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only
question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot;</P>

<P>ROBERT KENNEDY, former U.S. Attorney General of the U.S: &quot;All of
us will ultimately be judged on the effort we have contributed to building
a NEW WORLD ORDER.&quot; - 1967. (We can all agree with Robert on one thing:
All Traitors who participate in the NWO WILL be judged one day!)</P>

<P>-15-</P>

<P>THE WORLD MONEY POWERS</P>

<P>The Global MONEY Vampires are in control of the finances of most of
the world. Here are some statements of those who, past and present, have
been aware of that control:</P>

<P>GEORGE W. MALONE, U.S. Senator (Nevada), speaking before Congress in
1957, alluded to the families that secretly own the &quot;Federal&quot;
Reserve Bank and control the finances of the U.S.. He stated:</P>

<P>&quot;I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what
Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move move
on to Washington; whey would not wait for an election...It adds up to a
preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the
United States!&quot;</P>

<P>THOMAS JEFFERSON, U.S. President: &quot;I believe that banking institutions
are more dangerous to our liberties that standing armies. Already they
have raised up a moneyed aristocracy that has set the Government at defiance.
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people
to whom it properly belongs.&quot;</P>

<P>JAMES A. GARFIELD, U.S. President: &quot;Whoever controls the volume
of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.&quot;</P>

<P>HENRY FORD, Founder of Ford Motor Company, commented on the privately
owned &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve System scam: &quot;It is well enough
that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system,
for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow
morning.&quot;</P>

<P>-16-</P>

<P>LEWIS MCFADDIN, U.S. Congressman, said this about those same international
financial conspirators, during the very time they were taking over the
monetary control of America: &quot;We have in this country one of the most
corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve
Board and the Federal Reserve Banks, hereinafter called the FED. They are
not government institutions. They are private monopolies which pray upon
the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and their
foreign customers...&quot;</P>

<P>AMERICAN MECURY MAGAZINE, December 1957, pg. 92 &quot;The invisible
Money Power is working to control and enslave mankind. It financed Communism,
Fascism, Marxism, Zionism and Socialism. All of these are directed to making
the United States a member of a World Government...&quot;</P>

<P>(With very little study one can easily prove the above is 100% factual
and correct!)</P>

<P>MAYER AMSHEL BAUER, (Alias Rothschild/Head Bloodsucker) The Godfather
of the Rothschild Banking Cartel of Europe stated, &quot;Give me control
of a nation's money and I care not who makes the laws.&quot;</P>

<P>(Our Congress gave him and fellow International Bankers complete control
of the U.S. monetary system through passage of the &quot;Federal&quot;
Reserve Act, the Income Tax Act, and the 17th Amendment in 1913.)</P>

<P>ROTHSCHILD BROTHERS OF LONDON. In a letter discussing their new banking
scheme with fellow conspirators, June 25, 1863, they stated:</P>

<P>&quot;The few who understand the system, will either be so interested
in its profits, or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition
from that class. The great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending
the tremendous advantages will bear its burden without complaint&quot;.</P>

<P>(This was long before their takeover of the U.S. Banking system.)</P>

<P>RUSSELL MUNK, Assistant General Counsel, Dept. of the Treasury, in a
1977 letter admitted: &quot;Federal Reserve Notes Are Not Dollars.&quot;</P>

<P>(Then what is that paper stuff in your wallet?)</P>

<P>-17-</P>

<P>ONE LAST WORD ON THE MONEY VAMPIRES: Do we wonder why so many Americans
are being sucked dry and are losing their homes, farms and businesses of
each Americans are being sucked dry and are losing their homes, farms and
businesses each week? Is it just &quot;cycliacal (temporary) economic downturn&quot;
as the Establishment &quot;Experts&quot; and controlled media tell us?
That is a fabrication to the 10th power. If any Officer doubts this after
reading the preceding statements by the money parasites, it would be wise
to consider this secret communique circulated among the leading U.S. Bankers
only, way back in 1934, entitled.</P>

<P>&quot;THE BANKER'S MANIFESTO&quot;:</P>

<P>&quot;Capital must protect itself in every way...Debts must be collected
and loans and mortgages foreclosed as soon as possible. When through a
process of law the common people have lost their homes, they will be more
tractable and more easily governed by the STRONG ARM OF THE LAW (Cops)
applied by the central power of leading financiers. People without homes
will not quarrel with their leader. This is well known among our principal
men now engaged in forming an imperialism of capitalism to govern the world.
By dividing the people we can get them to expend their energies in fighting
over questions of not importance to us except as TEACHERS OF THE COMMON
HERD.&quot; (Taken from the Civil Servants' Year Book, &quot;The Organizer&quot;
Jan. 1934.)</P>

<P>Well, fellow &quot;Strong-Arms-of-the-Law&quot;, Americans are now losing
over 4,000 homes, 2,000 farms, 2,500 businesses per week to the Money Vampires
who made the prior statement. Is it just coincidence? How many homes, businesses
and farms have you helped take away from good Americans for the IRS/Banksters?
For those Officers who still do not know it, &quot;YES, THE IRS IS AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THE WORLD ORDER PLAN TO DIVEST AMERICANS OF THEIR WEALTH, AND MAKE
THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES PAY FOR THEIR OWN NATIONAL DESTRUCTION.&quot;</P>

<P>The above should make every Officer stop and think before assisting
the bankers or &quot;their&quot; IRS government revenue agents.</P>

<P>It happens a thousand times a day across this land that our fellow Officers
are unknowingly made a party to fraud and theft. And if you are one such
Officer, then YOU unknowingly become the &quot;executioners&quot; for the
men behind this diabolical system. Take heart, Officer. You can learn,
as many others have, how to be a VAMPIRE KILLER, uphold your oath to protect
the American People, and at the same time stay within the law.</P>

<P><A NAME="-18-"></A>-18-</P>

<P>MEDIA BLACKS OUT THE FACTS</P>

<P>&quot;BUT SURELY, IF THIS WORLD CONSPIRACY WERE TRUE I WOULD HAVE HEARD
ABOUT IT IN THE DAILY NEWS!&quot;</P>

<P>As in all investigations, it always comes down to, &quot;How can we
prove our case?&quot; We personally feel it's hard to top the proof coming
from the mouths of the very ones involved in this treacherous unAmerican
program. Here's one terrific example. John Swinton, the former Chief of
Staff for the New York Times, was one of America's best loved newspapermen.
Called by his peers &quot;The Dean of his Profession&quot;, John was asked
in 1953 to give a toast before the New York Press Club, and in so doing
made a monumentally important and revealing statement. He is quoted as
follows:</P>

<P>&quot;There is no such thing, at this date of the world's history, in
America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not
one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you
know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for
keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with. Others
of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who
would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets
looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one
issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.
The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth; to lie outright;
to pervert; to vilify; to fawn at the feet of common, and to sell his country
and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it and what folly
is this toasting an independent press? We are the tools and vassals of
rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings
and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the</P>

<P>-19-</P>

<P>property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.&quot; Hard to
believe? If there is any doubt - read on.</P>

<P>RICHARD M. COHAN, Senior Producer of CBS political news said: &quot;We
are going to impose OUR AGENDA on the coverage by dealing with issues and
subjects that WE choose to deal with.&quot;</P>

<P>RICHARD SALANT, former President of CBS News stated: &quot;Our job is
to give people not what they want, but what WE decide they ought to have.&quot;</P>

<P>And what is their &quot;agenda&quot;? What do they believe we, the american
people, - THE COMMON HERD, &quot;...ought to have&quot;? Here is the answer:</P>

<P>U.S. COMMUNIST SAYS &quot;LIBERALISM&quot; IS SOCIALISM</P>

<P>NORMAN THOMAS, For many years the U.S. Socialist Presidential candidate
proclaimed: &quot;The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism.
But under the name of &quot;liberalism&quot; they will adopt every fragment
of the Socialist program, until one day America will be a Socialist nation,
without knowing how it happened.&quot;</P>

<P>(How sadly true his words. He (Thomas) and Gus Hall, the U.S. Communist
Party candidate, both quit Americans politics, agreeing that the Republican
and Democratic parties by 1970 had adopted every plank of the Communist/Socialist
Party and they no longer had an alternative party platform on which to
run.)</P>

<P>Following are some statements made by a few America's top news personalities,
but altered just slightly. In honor of Socialist Presidential candidate
Thomas, following each use of the word &quot;liberal&quot; let's place
also the word &quot;socialist&quot;. This may help us gain some insight
into why America, after 70-plus years of continual &quot;liberal&quot;
indoctrination on every media, educational, and political front, has drawn
&quot;Socialism/Communism&quot; and the New World Order to her bosom.</P>

<P>HERMAN DISMORE, foreign editor of the N.Y. Times from 1950 to 1960:
&quot;The New York Times is deliberately pitched to the liberal (socialist)
point of view.&quot;</P>

<P>WALTER CRONKITE: &quot;News reporters are certainly liberal (socialist)
and left of center.&quot;</P>

<P>BARBARA WALTERS: &quot;The news media in general are liberals (socialist).&quot;</P>

<P>We could go on, but I believe we get their point!</P>

<P><A NAME="-20-"></A>-20-</P>

<P>WORLD GOVERNMENT UNDER THE U.N.</P>

<P>Just what is this most &quot;wonderful&quot; global organization all
about?</P>

<P>DR. KURK E. KOCH, Professor, Lectured at 100 Universities in 65 countries
on 5 continents. Subjects of expertise: New World Order, Occultism, Extreme
Movements, Parapsychology. His assessment of the coming NWO under the United
Nations is that it will reduce everything to one common denominator:</P>

<P>&quot;The system will be made up of a single currency single centrally
financed government, single tax system, single language, single political
system, single world court of justice, single head (one individual leader),
single state religion.&quot;</P>

<P>He further states: &quot;Each person will have a registered number,
without which he will not be allowed to buy or sell; and there will be
one universal world church. Anyone who refuses to take part in this universal
system will have no right to exist.&quot;</P>

<P>We should ask the following question of those fellow Officers who may
doubt that they will be asked to enforce such a system on the American
people, &quot;Whom do they think will enforce all of this?&quot; Who will
make the masses &quot;fit-in&quot;? Who will &quot;remove&quot; those who
do not fit-in? Will it be the auto mechanics, bankers, school teachers,
bakers, or candlestick makers??? Or, is it more likely to be Enforcement
Officers?</P>

<P>JOHN E. RANKIN, U.S. Congressman: &quot;The United Nations is the greatest
fraud in all History. Its purpose is to destroy the United States.&quot;</P>

<P>-21-</P>

<P>GEORGE BUSH, New York 1991, &quot;My vision of a NEW WORLD ORDER foresees
a United Nations with a revitalized peacekeeping function.&quot;</P>

<P>And one more classic quote from our traitor President: &quot;It is the
SACRED principles enshrined in the UN Charter to which we will henceforth
pledge our allegiance.&quot; - UN Building, February 1, 1992.</P>

<P>UNBELIEVABLE! That ought to FRY THE GRITS OF EVERY LAWMAN AND TRUE AMERICAN
THAT READS THIS QUOTE. Brother and sister Officers, how many of you are
going to take a &quot;sacred&quot; oath of allegiance to the U.N. World
Government?</P>

<P>Imagine, there will still be a few of our fellow Officers who will read
this treasonous claptrap and not believe that they will soon be ENFORCERS
in a totalitarian world government.</P>

<P>There is no question that Bush, Clinton and Perot want Officer to join
them in swearing allegiance to such as the following:</P>

<P>UNITED NATIONS' WORLD CONSTITUTION: &quot;...The age of nations must
end...The governments of the nations have decided to order their separate
sovereignties into one government to which they surrender their arms.&quot;</P>

<P>NEED WE SAY MORE?</P>

<P>We must, with great haste, awaken our fellow officers and ask them,
&quot;Will you pledge your allegiance to this NEW SLAVE STATE as your traitor
President of his fellow Internationalists Slick Willie Clinton and H.Ross
Perot believe you will??</P>

<P>ZBIGNIEW BREZHINSKY, National Security Advisor to Pres. Jimmy Carter
and advisor to 4 other presidents, Exec. Dir. of Trilateral Comm., Marxist
and proud of it! Here he speaks about what a New World Order will be like:
&quot;The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled
society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by
traditional values.&quot;</P>

<P>-22-</P>

<P>WE MUST MAKE OFFICERS LISTEN! Whom do we think will &quot;dominate&quot;
the masses in UN-controlled society of &quot;non-traditional&quot; (unGodly)
values?</P>

<P>ZBIGNIEW continues: &quot;Soon it will be possible to assert almost
continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete
files containing even the most personal information about the citizen.
These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.&quot;
- From Zbig's book, BETWEEN TWO AGES.</P>

<P>ADLAI STEVENSON, Council on Foreign Relations member and promoter of
U.N. &quot;Salvation&quot;: &quot;The U.S. program (UN program) calls for
total elimination of national capacity to make international war.&quot;
(Take comfort in the fact that the U.N. Promises to protect us.)</P>

<P>WALT RUSTOW, Council on Foreign Relations member and U.N. spokesmen:
&quot;It is in the American interest to put an end to Nationhood.&quot;
(Sure it is, Walter!)</P>

<P>HUMANIST MANIFESTO, Article 12: &quot;We deplore the division of humankind
on nationalistic grounds. We have reached a turning point in human history
where the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereignty
and to move towards the building of a world community. We look towards
the development of a system of world law, world order, based upon transnational
government.&quot; (Humanists propose that the United Nations care for and
control all peoples of the earth.)</P>

<P>LT. COL. JAMES &quot;BO&quot; GRITZ (RET), U.S. Presidential Candidate
1992, Most decorated Green Beret Commander in American history. Commander,
U.S. Army Special Forces, Latin America. Chief, Delta force. This great
American hero explains the conspiracy within the U.S. government as follows:
&quot;...A spider web of &quot;patriots for profit,&quot; operating from
the highest positions of special trust and confidence, have successfully
circumvented our constitutional system in pursuit of a New World Order.
They have infused America with drugs in order to fund covert operations
while sealing the fate of our servicemen left in Communist prisons.</P>

<P>Hiding behind a mask of official righteousness, this secret combination
seeks to impose its own concept of geopolitical navigation, nullifying
liberty as the hard won birthright of all Americans&quot;.</P>

<P>THE RELIGION OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER?</P>

<P>DAVID SPANGLER, Director of PLANETARY INITIATIVE, (a United Nations
World government group): &quot;No one will enter the New World Order unless
he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the
New Age unless she will take a Luciferian Initiation.&quot;</P>

<P>RALPH NADER: &quot;Is there a number or mark planned for the hard or
forehead in a new cashless society? YES, and I have seen the machines that
are now ready to put it into operation.&quot;</P>

<P>(Does this sounds familiar - hand and forehead???) This &quot;marking&quot;
may be another job for our U.S. Police Officers/Guardsmen, soon to be U.N.
Enforcers, who have taken to U.N. oath of allegiance which &quot;Boner&quot;
Bush mentioned earlier.)</P>

<P>FRENCH TRAVEL POSTER</P>

<P>1992 French &quot;New World Order&quot; Color Poster: Depicts people
as robots, constructing a new Tower of Babel inside the old tower that
God had destroyed. These robotic people are trying to reach their god who
is depicted with the sigh of Lucifer (the Goat of Mendez five pointed star)
above the newly built tower. The caption reads, &quot;EUROPE: MANY TONGUES,
ONE VOICE.&quot;</P>

<P>As students of the Scriptures know, the building of the Tower of Babel
was man's first attempt to set up a World Order. God himself destroyed
this abomination and punished the people. This poster is most revealing.
A copy in the right hands can assist in pointing out to our colleagues
that many of those who are in leadership in establishing this new order
are</P>

<P>-24-</P>

<P>truly religious, not atheist, as we are led to believe. But, whom do
they worship? The poster clearly shows their god is Lucifer and they are
proud of it. The picture on the poster points out that the New World Order
promoters know the Scriptures and they are determined to once again defy
the One True God.</P>

<P>We are presently in the process of trying to get several hundred of
these French New World Order Posters. It looks like we may be successful
and some of you may wish to have one. If you are interested here is the
deal: The donations/proceeds from the sales of this color poster will be
used as a fundraiser to reach and educate more of our colleagues in Law
Enforcement. Order through Aid &amp; Abet Police Newsletter for $6 single,
$10 for 2, $4 for 3-5. $3 P&amp;H for protective tube container. (If we
get them in, it will have to be &quot;first come, first served&quot;.)</P>

<P>NEW AGE PROFESSORS TEACH OUR CHILDREN'S TEACHERS</P>

<P>Turning now to education, let's quote a few of the top U.S. spokesmen
and professors in that field, to see the over-all philosophy used to train
our teachers, who then go on to prepare our children for the New World
Order.</P>

<P>DR. CHESTER PIERCE, Harvard University Professor, Humanist, New World
Order Guru. This Professor instructs teachers and those students who aspire
to become teachers of our children as follows:</P>

<P>&quot;Every child in America who enters a school at the age of five
is mentally ill, because he comes to school with an allegiance to our institutions,
toward the preservation of this form of government that we have. Patriotism,
Nationalism, and sovereignty, all that proves that children are sick because
a truly well individual is one who has rejected all of those things, and
is truly the international child of the future.&quot;</P>

<P>DR. PAUL BRANDWEIN, Leading U.S. child psychologist. This man also instructs
teachers on how to recognize mental disability in our school children.
He states: &quot;Every child who believes in God is mentally ill.&quot;
(All government schools have a psychologist.)</P>

<P>DR. SIDNEY SIMON, Lecturer, Educator who some say specializes in encouraging
immoral and criminal activity in youths. He instructs teachers as follows:</P>

<P>&quot;We do not need any more preaching about right and wrong. The old
'thou shalt nots' simply are not relevant.&quot; Further he says, &quot;Values
clarification is a method for teachers to change the values of children
without getting caught.&quot;</P>

<P><A NAME="-26-"></A>-26-</P>

<P>HUMANIST CURRICULUM: Along with these &quot;Humanist Wackos&quot; training
our nation's teachers to be &quot;change agents&quot; for their New World
Order, there is the matter of the literature that they have for teachers
to use to instruct American children. One such book entitled &quot;Weep
for Our Children&quot;, might explain to Police Officers a great deal about
why crime rates in school age children are skyrocketing. Consider this
one passage touting the humanistic &quot;Values Clarification/Situation
Ethics&quot; program:</P>

<P>&quot;It's OK to lie. It's OK to steal. It's OK to have premarital sex.
It's OK to cheat or to kill if these things are part of your value system,
and you clarified these values for yourself. THe important thing is not
what values you choose, but that you have chosen them yourself freely and
without coercion of parents, spouse, priest, friends, ministers or social
pressure of any kind.&quot;</P>

<P>This type of values/moral code (or lack thereof!) is all to evident
in America's schools today, as many Police Officers know. many officers
write expressing alarm at seeing this type of unholy &quot;Situation Ethics&quot;
instruction so wide-spread in our nation's schools.</P>

<P>PSYCHIATRISTS LEAD THE WAY</P>

<P>For decades, it has been the job of those within the psychology field
to introduce to the American public the idea that those who believe in
God are sick and must be &quot;enlightened&quot; or eliminated, and that
&quot;immorality&quot; is the only path to the NEW AGE. And indeed it is.
The several quotes below will drive home this well planned scenario.</P>

<P>BERTRAND RUSSELL, philosopher, educator and atheist: &quot;I think the
subject which will be of most importance politically is Mass Psychology...It's
importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods
of propaganda...ALthough this science will be diligently studied, it will
be rigidly confined to the governing class (Elite). The populace will not
be allowed to know how its convictions were generated.&quot;</P>

<P>One of the great Psychiatric Gurus of Mental Health speaks:</P>

<P>DR G. BROCK CHISHOLM, First head of the World Federation of Mental Health
(A NWO group.) &quot;What basic psychological distortion can be found in
every civilization of which we know anything? The only psychological force
capable of producing these perversions is morality - the concept of right
and wrong. The re-interpretation and eventual</P>

<P>-27-</P>

<P>eradication of the concept of right and wrong are the belated objectives
of nearly all psychotherapy.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The pretense is made that to do away with right and wrong would
produce uncivilized people, immorality, lawlessness, and social chaos.
The fact is that most psychiatrists and psychologists and other respected
people have escaped from moral chains and are able to think freely.&quot;
- Taken from the updated book, NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON, by J.A. Stormer.</P>

<P>Police Officers have been among the first to notice that such teachings
have produced exactly the results he (the good Doctor) said they would
not produce. He lied. There is no greater promoter of change than FEAR,
and no greater creator of fear than chaos and lawlessness throughout a
nation. The enemy of our system knows that immorality breeds chaos and
lawlessness. Chaos and lawlessness breeds fear in the people and when fearful
enough the people will accept any solutions. Guess what the solution is?</P>

<P>We agree with Dr. Chisholm, that most of these minions of &quot;psycho-babble&quot;
have truly &quot;escaped&quot; from any and all moral foundation in their
lives. Anything their patients dream up is perfectly O.K. and encouraged
by most such &quot;professionals&quot;. This &quot;there is no right or
wrong&quot; psycho-babble is what is being drilled into the heads of those
American school children whose parents have unfortunately placed them in
Government Indoctrination Centers which we erroneously call our &quot;educational&quot;
system.</P>

<P>In case any officer reading this publication thinks that this change
in the morals of our nation is accidental, he or she must read the book,
&quot;THE SOVIET ART OF BRAIN WASHING - A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook
on Psychopolitics&quot;, written by a Kenneth Goff. In this book, Goff,
a one-time dues-paying member of the Communist Party, writes: &quot;During
my training I was trained in Psychopolitics. This was the art of capturing
the minds of a nation through brainwashing and fake mental health.&quot;</P>

<P>Kenneth Goff paid a high price for his efforts to alert the American
people. After attempting to inform America of Marxist-trained Psychologists
being placed inside the U.S. to change the morals and beliefs of our nation,
he mysteriously died from poisoning in 1943. His farewell in his book says:
&quot;This manual of the Communist Party should be in the hands of every
loyal American, that they may be alerted to the fact that it is not always
by armies and guns that a nation is conquered.&quot; In this book is found
an address by Beria, the Head</P>

<P>-28-</P>

<P>of the Lenin University School of Psychopolitics. His 1933 address to
a group of American/Marxist Psychology students is most revealing.</P>

<P>Speaking to this group who would be returning to ply their treachery
in the U.S. he said:</P>

<P>&quot;A psychopolitician must work hard to produce the maximum chaos
in the fields of 'mental healing.' You must work until every teacher of
psychology unknowingly or knowingly teachers only Communist doctrine under
the guise of 'psychology.' You must labor until every doctor and psychiatrist
is either a psycho-politician or an unwitting assistant to our aims. You
most labor until we have dominion over the minds and bodies of every important
person in your nation (America). You must work until suicide arising from
mental imbalance is common and calls forth no general investigation or
remark... You must dominate as respected men the fields of psychiatry and
psychology. You must dominate the hospitals and universities... You can
come and take your instruction as worshipers of Freud...Psychopolitics
is a solemn charge. With it you can erase our enemies as insects. You (psychologists)
can change their (leaders) loyalties by psychopolitics. Given a short time
with a psychopolitician you can alter forever the loyalty of a soldier
in our hands or a statesman or a leader in his own country, or you can
destroy his mind.</P>

<P>Use the courts, use the judges, use the Constitution of the country,
use its medical societies and its laws to further our ends...By psychopolitics
create chaos. Leave a nation leaderless. Kill our enemies. And bring to
Earth, through Communism, the greatest peace man has ever known. Thank
you.&quot;</P>

<P>(This is only a short part of Beria's speech to the visiting American
psychology students.)</P>

<P>NOTE: Everything he asked these students to accomplish when they returned
to practice their &quot;art&quot; in our nation has occurred. And now we
can look forward to that &quot;peace&quot; he promised under the U.N. New
World Order.</P>

<P><A NAME="-29-"></A>-29-</P>

<P>WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED &quot;PEACE&quot; ?</P>

<P>JOSEPH STALIN stated that after Communism succeeds, &quot;...then, there
will come a peace across the earth.&quot;</P>

<P>KARL MARX said, &quot;...the meaning of peace is the absence of opposition
to Socialism.&quot;</P>

<P>THE LORD GOD said, &quot;...they have seduced my people, saying PEACE;
and there was NO PEACE.&quot; (Ezekiel 13:10)</P>

<P>St. Paul said, &quot;For when they shall say, 'PEACE and SAFETY', then
sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child;
and they shall not escape.&quot; (1 Thes. 5:3)</P>

<P>We should note that the Globalist' main tactic and motivation to entice
the world's people into their United Nations trap is ultimate &quot;PEACE
and SAFETY&quot;.</P>

<P>FOUNDING FATHERS' RECIPE FOR SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT</P>

<P>This affords a good chance to show the contrast between the kind of
government our great leaders of the past gave us as a nation, and the immoral
cesspool that is in place today. Using the memorable quotes that follow,
compare and see if you can figure out why today our government, our families,
and individuals lives by the millions are falling apart.</P>

<P>-30-</P>

<P>JAMES MADISON: &quot;We have staked the whole future of American civilization,
not upon the power of government, far from it. We have staked the future...upon
the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to sustain ourselves,
according to the Ten Commandments of God.&quot; (Question: Do we still
govern and sustain ourselves by the Ten Commandments today?)</P>

<P>JOHN ADAMS: &quot;Our Constitution was made only for a religious and
moral people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.&quot;
(Question: Are Americans still a religious and moral people?)</P>

<P>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: &quot;Man will ultimately be governed by GOD or by
tyrants.&quot; (Question:Which is it that governs us today)</P>

<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON: &quot;The people know it is impossible to rightly
govern without GOD and the BIBLE.&quot; (Question: Are we sure the American
people still know this today?)</P>

<P>ANDREW JACKSON: &quot;The BIBLE is the rock on which our Republic rests.&quot;</P>

<P>(Two Questions: -1) When is the last time you have heard of a public
official honestly and accurately call America a Republic? 2) On the other
hand, can a democracy rest on the BIBLE?</P>

<P>DANIEL WEBSTER: &quot;If we abide by the principles taught in the BIBLE,
our country will go on prospering.&quot; (Question: Why is our nation not
prospering?)</P>

<P>ALEXIS DE TOQUEVILLE: Upon visiting America in the early 19th century,
this French historian observed: &quot;America is great because America
is GOOD. If America ever ceases to be good it will cease to be great.&quot;</P>

<P>* QUESTION: Based on the above quotes, &quot;Why did America become
the greatest nation in history?&quot;</P>

<P>* QUESTION: Did the Founders place the concept of Separation of CHurch
and State in our Constitution? Answer: NO. It is found only in the Communist
Constitution.</P>

<P>* QUESTION: If one wanted to destroy a nation like America, would he
not look to what the Founders said was the cornerstone (Laws of God) upon
which our REpublic was built, and then ATTACK THAT VERY FOUNDATION?</P>

<P>-31-</P>

<P>GOALS OF AMERICA's ENEMIES</P>

<P>KARL MARX: &quot;My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism.&quot;
(Question: Has he succeeded?)</P>

<P>LEV DAVIDOVICH TROTSKY: &quot;Religions are illogical primitive ignorance.
There is nothing as ridiculous and tragic as a religious government.&quot;</P>

<P>ANOTHER QUESTION: Is Trotsky's or Marx's plan any different than the
Humanist Movement's plan? Check below.</P>

<P>AMERICAN HUMANIST MOVEMENT, Doctrinal statement:</P>

<P>&quot;We are humanist...We are not for God...We are for socialism.&quot;</P>

<P>HUMANIST MAGAZINE, 1983 Jan.-Feb. issue. Humanist John J. Dunphy: &quot;I
am convinced that the battle for humankind's future must be waged and won
in the public school classroom by teachers that correctly perceive their
role as proselytizers of a new faith which will replace the rotting corpse
of Christianity.&quot;</P>

<P>HAVE THEY REACHED THEIR GOALS? (Check it out below.)</P>

<P>COMMUNIST RULES FOR REVOLUTION (Captured at Dusseldorf in May 1919 by
Allied Forces)</P>

<P>1. Corrupt the young; get them away from religion. Get them interested
in sex. Make them superficial; destroy their ruggedness.</P>

<P>2. By specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues:
honesty, sobriety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness.</P>

<P>3. Encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude
on the part of government toward such disorders. (L.A. riots were just
a coincidence?! ... Of course!)</P>

<P>4. Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial
matters of no importance. (Racial differences?)</P>

<P>5. Get people's minds off their government by focusing their attention
on athletics, sexy books, plays, and other trivialities.</P>

<P>-32-</P>

<P>6. Get control of all means of publicity. (Media)</P>

<P>7. Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding the
latter up to contempt, ridicule and obloquy (disgrace).</P>

<P>8. Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a view
to confiscation and leaving the population helpless.</P>

<P>This is only a partial list. It was secured and stamped with the seal
of Florida State Attorney, George A. Broutigam. This material testimony
was taken from someone he terms &quot;a known member of the Communist Party&quot;.
According to this Communist's testimony this strategy is still part of
the Communist plan to overthrow free societies such as the United States.</P>

<P>(Can the reader find any of these 8 items that has NOT already been
installed in the American system?)</P>

<P>IN CONTRAST:</P>

<P>Thomas Jefferson says, &quot;To compel a man to furnish funds for the
propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.&quot;
(Indeed it is!)</P>

<P>Most officers don't realize it but their federal and state governments
are funding programs that were created by anti-American/New World Order
proponents for the express purpose of lowering America's economic, spiritual
and moral standards. (The North American Free Trade Agreement another destructive
device being foisted on gullible Americans.)</P>

<P>PLAN WORKING PERFECTLY</P>

<P>So far we have put the spotlight on a good many New World ORder BLOOD
SUCKERS - obvious spies, seditions, traitors, some of them Americans, some
foreign. There is an important, underlying factor in all this that must
not be missed: The global conspirators, along with thousands of their world
government &quot;comrades&quot; in the U.S. have been deliberately whipping
the American public into a fearful frenzy.</P>

<P>With just the &quot;right&quot; manipulations, they have been successfully
conditioning our people to see all our societal systems - governmental,
political, educational, penal, ecological, etc. - as completely out of
control. This is not true.</P>

<P>-33-</P>

<P>Let us not be fooled. All of these areas are completely under their
control and have been for decades.</P>

<P>They are functioning just as well as the enemy wishes them to function.
Remember also what Rowan Gaither, head of the Ford Foundation said (on
page 12 of this publication), the task is to &quot;covertly lower the standard
of living, the whole social structure, of America so that we can be MERGED
with all other nations.&quot;</P>

<P>FACT: Their Parasitic PLAN to cause this total (controlled) breakdown
is &quot;right on course&quot;. The American system is collapsing &quot;on
time&quot;, and just as programmed. Remember what FDR said, &quot;In politics
nothing happens by accident. If it happened, you can bet it was planned
that way.&quot;</P>

<P>The plan of these globalists is that when America, the last &quot;holdout&quot;,
is brought to its knees, the American &quot;sheep&quot; will beg their
new god (GOVERNMENT) to save them! The &quot;salvation&quot; they are demanding
will be the merging together of all nations under that great &quot;bastian
of peace and freedom&quot;, the United Nations.</P>

<P><A NAME="-34-"></A>-34-</P>

<P>TRAITORS' GRAND FINALES (Martial law the Goal.)</P>

<P>PLAN A</P>

<P>RACE WARS: We will see the fanning of the flames of their planned RACE
WAR program in the months ahead as government, through some of their covert
national organizations, promotes &quot;whites hating people of color&quot;
and vice-versa. Aided by their controlled media, and NWO government-paid
agitators/&quot;leaders&quot; on both sides, the goal is to frighten Americans,
of all colors, into accepting Martial Law. These elitists actually have
no lover for &quot;minorities&quot; or &quot;commoners&quot; of any race.
Those who have studied these Imperialists will notice that there is continual
intermarriage among these super rich Internationalists' families. NEVER
do they participate in the mixing of blood other than BLUE BLOOD. The race-mixing
program was created for their &quot;subjects&quot; - i.e. the world's common
people of all races. Some of these Internationalists have stated over the
years, &quot;...when all other humans are of one color, (brown), then they
will be more easily managed.&quot;</P>

<P>KEEP THE RACES FROM JOINING TOGETHER!</P>

<P>Racial strife is one of their most important NWO tools and they mean
to keep it going. It has worked well for promoting the globalist cause
in the recent past. HATE must be kept flowing to prevent the various races
in America from finding out the truth. If they find out</P>

<P>-35-</P>

<P>who is destroying their freedoms and economic future, they might find
some way to work together to overthrow their COMMON ENEMY.</P>

<P>WHO ARE THE AGENT-PROVOCATEURS?</P>

<P>Our problem is in identifying these NWO lackeys (agent/provocateurs).
Incoming intelligence over the years has informed us that these provocateurs
are of all racial mixes. Yes, whites, blacks, hispanic etc. are involved
in promoting planned racial hate incidents and tensions to assist in causing
the masses to accept Martial Law and serve the NWO gang. Although these
employee/provocateurs have been promised a position of power in this &quot;utopian&quot;
Socialist society, it is a shame that they are not smart enough to know
that they are to be &quot;eliminated&quot; when their usefulness has run
out. (As has been the practice of every Marxist/Socialist conquering army
after taking power.)</P>

<P>There is sound logic in this &quot;execution of your agent/provocateurs&quot;,
after you're in power. The logic is: &quot;If these agents will spy and
turn again their own people, then there is no way you can trust them to
not turn on you.&quot; VERY TRUE! The other shame is that no tears will
be shed for these traitors to their own people.</P>

<P><A NAME="34B"></A>PLAN B</P>

<P>The globalists, along with their controlled media, are well along in
the promotion of their PLAN B program. Here it is: With the threat of nuclear
way supposedly subsiding, the American people &quot;must have&quot; a new
Boogie Man!</P>

<P>ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSE: This phase involves the fraud of the &quot;imminent
ecological collapse of the world&quot;. this phase is being promoted by
these who were not able to completely destroy America with Marxism. These
NWO Marxist have therefore started, or taken over, the various GREEN (environmentalist)
parties.</P>

<P>Many of these environmentalists are rightfully labeled the &quot;WATERMELONS
of the world&quot;. That is to say, green on the outside, but RED (Marxist)
on the inside. Many wonderful, good, well-intentioned Americans are being
duped into assisting with this fraud. Sadly, some are our families and
friends.</P>

<P>-36-</P>

<P><A NAME="34C"></A>PLAN C</P>

<P>VISITORS FROM AFAR: This phase makes certain that few Americans escape
the NWO program. How? By creating TOTAL PANIC. This is accomplished with
3 choices being offered to the gullible. The Globalists have &quot;suddenly&quot;
brought to light their long planned and well established &quot;UFO-Little-Devils-from-Outer-Space&quot;
CON, to strike utter fear in the hearts of all the people of the earth.</P>

<P>* The first choice: The subtle message to us, &quot;the masses&quot;,
is that, if we don't go willingly and gently into global government, we
will be &quot;eaten&quot;, &quot;raped&quot;, or become the experimental
guinea pigs of some far-our evil &quot;SPACE CADETS&quot;. And of course,
you can't ask for assistance and protection from your own country's government
because as we all have been told, &quot;no individual nation could possibly
stand a chance in defense against this obviously 'Superior' Race from space.&quot;
AH, but isn't it wonderful that &quot;salvation&quot; is only a one-world-government
away?!?</P>

<P>* A second twist to this planned scenario is: These &quot;cute little
space things&quot; are our BOSOM BUDDIES; they bring us tiding of good
will, and come &quot;conveniently&quot; to SAVE our world from the brink
of total destruction! &quot;Isn't that precious?!&quot;</P>

<P>In other words, this particular plan is to convince gullible Americans
that anyone of anything (but that Jesus Christ &quot;guy&quot;), WILL SAVE
OUR WORLD!</P>

<P>Quite &quot;coincidentally&quot;, these same &quot;funny little fellows&quot;
are also here to set up a UTOPIAN GLOBAL SOCIETY! Surprised?</P>

<P>* And the newest twist to the CON (to grab religious Americans that
did not fall for the first two) is that Christ Himself has sent these wonderful
little &quot;UFO things&quot;, in HIS place, to save us. (Suggesting, we
suppose, that Jesus Christ got busy and had to &quot;delegate&quot;. And
as soon as these &quot;wonderful&quot; Space &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;
get us all together in a New World Society, He (Christ) will be along to
take over. Think of them as God's Secret Service advance team!) Believe
it or not.</P>

<P>Is there something there?...&quot;OUT THERE&quot;? Absolutely! But,
are THEY truly coming from &quot;out-there&quot;? We are not to be told,
at this time, the truth about what these entities are, or who has absolute
control over them. If we were told the truth we would never fall for their
New World Order UFO con.</P>

<P>-37-</P>

<P>It is sad to see coming true what the Scriptures foretold, namely, that
some of the most spiritual and intelligent people in our world are being
completely deceived by our government and &quot;spiritually enlightened&quot;
conmen..(and women).</P>

<P>As foretold, it's happening before our eyes. SHAME!</P>

<P>In all seriousness, for anyone that does not believe that the UFO scare
is a contrived fraud, it should be agreed that the wise position to take
is on the side of caution. Consider it possible that those who promote
the NWO plan are presently involved in a &quot;trial run&quot; of all three
of the above-described UFO scenarios. Such plans are being promoted by
the Globalists, among those whom they consider to be the &quot;Wacko&quot;,
&quot;Radical&quot;, &quot;Extremist&quot;, Nationalist, Pro-American organizations,
in order to test which scenario is more acceptable. For example, pick any
one of the three scenarios below:</P>

<P>(1) The evil little devils from outer space, who will dissect, destroy,
or devious us all.</P>

<P>(2) The sweet, funny little COSMIC critters who, like our government,
are only &quot;HERE TO HELP YOU&quot;</P>

<P>And lastly, for the gullible religious masses:</P>

<P>(3) The Space &quot;Disciples of God&quot; bringing salvation to earthlings.</P>

<P>Indeed the Globalist care not which we choose. For they all lead to
their NEW WORLD ORDER. Tell our brothers and sisters to just - Think about
it!</P>

<P>(Some of the above information has come from those on the &quot;inside&quot;
and some from &quot;outside&quot; of our government. It's nice to have
our own agents inside their anti-American, anti-God cliques. What is that
French word - TOUCHE'?)</P>

<P>THE GREAT DELUSION - Will you be caught?</P>

<P>Called America's greatest female writer, Ellen G. White said it like
this:</P>

<P>&quot;The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist
is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit
resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between them
except by Holy Scriptures.&quot; (The Great Controversy, 1888). And so
it is.</P>

<P>-38-</P>

<P>LISTEN CAREFULLY! THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS PUBLICATION!</P>

<P>Some may say that this is not the type of publication that should get
into &quot;religion&quot;. We agree, to a point. However, if religion is
being used by the enemy of America to attack Americans, then like it or
not, we must address it. It is the enemy of our nation that is using &quot;spiritualism&quot;
to trick millions of religious fellow Officers and private citizens info
falling for their NEW AGE/NEW WORLD ORDER fraud. One wise tip: Leviticus
19:31 says, &quot;Regard not them that have familiar spirits; neither seek
after wizards, to be defied by them; I am the Lord your God.&quot;</P>

<P>COMMUNISM GONE? - DON'T TAKE ANY BETS!</P>

<P>V.I. LENIN: &quot;It would be the greatest mistake, certainly, to think
that concessions mean PEACE. Nothing of the kind. Concessions are nothing
but a new form of war.&quot;</P>

<P>DIMITRI MANUALISKY, Soviet Diplomat (1947) revealed the Communists'
intention to brainwash the American public: &quot;We will offer the Christian
world unheard of peace overtures, and these nations, stupid and decadent,
will leap at the chance to be our friends; they will willingly cooperate
in their own destruction. Then, when their guard is down, and they have
gone to sleep, we will smash them with out clenched fist.&quot;</P>

<P>Many gullible Americans, and the controlled U.S. media, will gush, &quot;The
above statement was uttered a long time ago and things have truly changed
in the new Commonwealth of &quot;Independent&quot; States (CIS). Is that
so? Read on!</P>

<P>MIKHAIL GORBACHEV's speech at the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution (1987): &quot;...In October 1917, we parted with the old world,
rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, a world,
rejecting it once and for all. We are moving toward a new world, a world
of Communism. We shall never turn off that road.&quot;</P>

<P>And from his speech to the Soviet Politburo, November 1987:</P>

<P>&quot;Gentlemen, comrades, do not be concerned about all you hear about
Glasnost and Perestroika and democracy in the coming years. These are primarily
for outward consumption. There will be no significant internal changes
in the Soviet Union, other than for cosmetic purposes. Out purpose is to
disarm the Americans and let them fall asleep. We want to accomplish three
things:</P>

<P>-40-</P>

<P>One, we want the Americans to withdraw conventional forces from Europe.</P>

<P>Two, we want them to withdraw nuclear forces from Europe.</P>

<P>Three, we want the Americans to stop proceeding with Strategic Defense
Initiative.&quot; (And alas, this is what has been done!)</P>

<P>GENERAL SIR WALTER WALKER, Former NATO Commander-in-chief, following
the phony Soviet coup, said: &quot;I consider it my duty to tell you of
the extremely dangerous threats that lie ahead. I KNOW FOR CERTAIN that
we are now in a period of the greatest strategic deception, perhaps in
all history...The Cold War is NOT over, only in the state of remission...The
Soviet Union is not truly 'on the verge of collapse'. Western defense,
on the other hand, is.&quot;</P>

<P>Many of our readers are Intelligence Officers or former Intelligence
Officers We thanks those readers who are members of the Intelligence community
for providing the following FACTS which back up Gorbie and Sir Walter Walker's
words:</P>

<P>FACT: Russian intelligence agencies are working as hard as ever at espionage
in the U.S. Both the DCI Robert Gates and FBI Director WIlliam Sessions
have spoken out on the high level of Russian intelligence collection efforts
in recent months, now known by its Russian acronym SVR. Senior FBI counterintelligence
official, Wayne Gilbert states the same thing, &quot;There has been no
apparent reduction in covert intelligence gathering here by the Russians.&quot;
In contrast, Chief of the SVR, Yevgeny Primakov, said during a recent visit
to Sweden, &quot;I can tell you we no longer have cloak and dagger spies
in the traditional sense, agents who meddle in other countries' internal
affairs.&quot; - (Newsletter of the Assoc. of Former Intelligence Officers,
Vol. XVII, No. 6, 1992.)</P>

<P>FACT: The KGB is still in control. As America's Global Elite purposely
the alleged breakup of the Soviet Union. It is housed under the new Russian
Ministry of Security. It has been greatly strengthened by Yelstin and is
involved in more espionage activities against the West than ever before.
As has happened four times in the past, after we (the West) once again
rebuild the Communist infrastructure, the same old KGB with a new face,
will step from its behind the scenes control of CIS to OUTWARDLY reclaim
control of the &quot;New&quot;, revitalized, rearmed, and more powerful
Soviet Union.</P>

<P>FACT: America and Canada are disarming unilaterally.</P>

<P>-41-</P>

<P>FACT: Unknown to the masses, each of the nations that have split off
from the &quot;defunct&quot; Soviet Union is presently covertly led by
hard line Communists.</P>

<P>FACT: The &quot;defunct&quot; Soviet military is presently building
more offensive weapons of all type, than at any time in its history. Production
rate:</P>

<P>* 1 Tank division per month.</P>

<P>* 700 new fighter aircraft (approx. 58 per months) in 1991 and 1992.</P>

<P>* 1 Nuclear Submarine every two months.</P>

<P>* Numerous Tactical nuke bomb and mobile launchers (actual number unknown).</P>

<P>(This intel update is per U.S. Intelligence sources 6/92.)</P>

<P>(As with the last 4 times this CON JOB of a &quot;Communist collapse&quot;
was perpetrated, all of this rearming and dramatic increases in espionage
is being accomplished while the Communists' economy &quot;CRASHES&quot;.</P>

<P>We must understand that this military build-up can occur only as long
as American tax dollars continue to feed the Commonwealth of &quot;Independent&quot;
States people. And that is part of the NWO plan. What is it &quot;Boner
Bush&quot; and other NWO nations are sending them? - 25 billion to begin
with?</P>

<P>Obviously, this has been an unbelievable CON JOB that started in 1917,
when fellow Parasites, Jacob Schiff on Kuhn, Loeb and Company, Prescott
Bush, Max M. Warburg, and a few other traitors sent by Leon Trotsky, with
his 300 New York trained private army of street thugs, to Russia with $20,000,000
in gold finance Lenin and the Bolshevik Revolution. These men started Communism
for one reason: to promote the takeover of our nation of free people by
Socialists so Americans would not be able to stand in the way of their
New World Order plans. There was no way they could do this if America remained
free, strong, and had no real threats to her security. For this reason,
they built America an enemy! (There is not space here for a big history
lesson regardless of the importance. For more of an honest review of our
historic record read THE NEW WORLD ORDER by Eustace Mullins. It can be
obtained from Ezra Pound Institute of Civilization, P.O. Box 1105, Staunton,
VA. 24401.</P>

<P><A NAME="-42-"></A>-42-</P>

<P>Police Officers must remember what the renowned H.L. Mencken said,</P>

<P>&quot;To die for an idea; it is unquestionably noble. But how much nobler
it would be if men died for ideas that were true.&quot;</P>

<P>Officers are told the reason guns have to be removed from the American
People is to stop crime and the killing of the innocent. This is a fabrication.
Truthfully, the only reason the guns must be removed is to stop any chance
of our countrymen raising up and throwing off the &quot;wonderful&quot;
programs that their &quot;philanthropic&quot; government leaders have planned
for them.</P>

<P>It is time to seriously consider what each of us will do when these
Global elitists in our government instruct OFFICERS and NATIONAL GUARDSMEN
to go forth and take the guns away from the armed, good people of your
city or town...&quot;FOR THEIR OWN GOOD&quot;. Most officers know the day
will come when they will have to make that very hard decision on this gun
removal issue. The evidence is all around us that this day is near.</P>

<P>Consider the Imperialist NWO position. For the World Elite to truly
enjoy their &quot;utopian&quot; Socialist Society, the subject masses must
not have a means to protect themselves against more &quot;voluntary compliance&quot;.
When one grasps this logical position, there is no longer any question
about it: THE GUNS WILL HAVE TO GO.</P>

<P>If there are any Officers who will still doubt this, we are about to
prove this planned scenario to you. Keep in mind that the second part of
the three-part plan of the NWO Regional Government program</P>

<P>-43-</P>

<P>(which precedes the One World Government) is that Canada, USA, Mexico
and South and Central America are to be combined into one Region. Hence,
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on a FAST-TRACK with
the backing of our notorious NWO President, NWO Congressmen, Senators and
Governors. The other 2 parts presently in the works are: First part - the
uniting of the European Nations (Common Market), and #3 - the uniting of
the Asian nations. These will make up the &quot;TRI&quot; [3] parts of
the Tri-lateral One World Government.</P>

<P>Understanding this well planned program will make the following &quot;PERSONAL
PROTECTION&quot; proclamation more clear to any doubting Bobbies.</P>

<P>You will find on the next page a recent declaration from the government
of Australia, which is a member of the British Commonwealth. The Canadians,
our soon-to-be northern countrymen, are also a British Commonwealth. Question:When
we are merged with the British Commonwealth by the Elitist NWO Parasites
will we assume these British Socialists' anti-gun laws or will they assume
ours?</P>

<P>(See Article, page 44.)</P>

<P>Realizing that the plan is to merge us Americans, Latin Americans, and
the Canadians, into one Region, you already know whose guns policies we
are to adopt. (Mexico has the same very limited gun rights as Canada and
Australia.)</P>

<P>DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY, OFFICER!</P>

<P>Officers should not worry. There is a &quot;good&quot; plan to get the
guns away from your fellow Americans. Should officers be concerned - just
because this &quot;good&quot; plan calls for them to go get 200,000,000
firearms (BATF figures are very low) away from 250,000,000 very &quot;peaceful
and cooperative&quot; citizens? What do you think?</P>

<P>SOME &quot;AN EASY MARK&quot;</P>

<P>Some guns will be easily removed. Many unsuspecting (and very naive)
Americans will turn in their &quot;liberty teeth&quot; (means of personal
protection) when told to do so. Every officer knows such people in the
community, i.e. those &quot;good&quot; citizens who are too scared to oppose
anything their government tells them to do.</P>

<P>-44-</P>

<P>See Picture 3 (If you can't read it then read the following..)</P>

<P>Personal Protection is NO reason to have a gun</P>

<P>If you own a gun which you keep to protect yourself, your family or
your property, you must dispose of it legally.</P>

<P>Under the latest gun laws, personal and property protection are no longer
considered acceptable reasons to possess any type of firearm, or to get
a license.</P>

<P>If you wish to possess any gun, you must have a license and meet the
new requirements for safe storage of the weapon and its ammunition. When
your current license expires you must reapply if you want to continue to
possess or use a gun. Be warned, making a false or misleading statement
on your license application could earn you ten years in prison.</P>

<P>Act quickly, if you haven't got a license, now is the time to either
apply for one, or legally dispose of your gun. One way you can do it is
at your local police station. Possession and use of any firearm for personal
or property protection is illegal and will attract severe penalties. No
exceptions, no excuses.</P>

<P><A NAME="-45-"></A>-45-</P>

<P>Yes, even if they know it's wrong, they will go along of just keep their
mouths shut. Every captive nation has a large percentage of such people.
These are the &quot;production units&quot; (PU's) that will fit very well
into the New World Order. They are ready-made slaves.</P>

<P>As strange as it may seem, many of theses &quot;sheep&quot; still believe
that they can trust and believe in our government to SAVE THEM from anarchy.
This is amusing to some of our government officials and Police Officers.
It amazes them that these people are so unaware of what is happening and
continue trusting the same government that has planned and promoted the
anarchy in the streets in the first place - precisely to scare them into
submission. (See Aid &amp; Abet Police Newsletter 2-2)</P>

<P>L.A. RIOTS - AN ORCHESTRATION.</P>

<P>A Prime example was the recent L.A. riots. The beating of King was not
part of the plan, but it offered a grand opportunity to accomplish three
important things for the Globalists.</P>

<P>1) Get rid of Chief Gates, who for years has stood in the way of Socialist
- NWO gang member, Tom Bradley and others involved in trying to get the
L.A. Police Dept. into the coming national police force. (See soon to be
release book, THE CENTRALIZATION OF U.S. POLICE POWERS, available from
U.S. Federal Law Research Center, P.O. Box 8712, Phx. AZ. 85066.)</P>

<P>2) Further convince the People that their only salvation from crime
and evil in society will be found in the &quot;protection&quot; provided
by a global government.</P>

<P>3) A grand opportunity for Globalists George, Pete and Tom to practice
FEMA - style Martial Law. It matters little that some among the masses
have to die. Remember, the new government philosophy is the same as that
of the Communist, &quot;THE END DOES INDEED JUSTIFY THE MEANS.&quot;</P>

<P>Once again, the masses were to think that everything was out of control.
It was not (the riots were planned). But it was a good enough reason that
in a matter of hours, 2,000 U.S. Marines were on the streets of an American
city. This was a very important test. A most severe breach of Constitutional
law was brought to bear; and more importantly, the People</P>

<P>-46-</P>

<P>said nothing. The masses complained only that the government should
have acted sooner and greater strength. For, when there is anarchy in the
streets the &quot;sheep&quot; do not care who saves them. This planned
Martial Law scenario actually worked out better than the NWO social planners
ever expected.</P>

<P>DETECTIVE BROWN SPEAKS OUT</P>

<P>Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Larry Brown speaking in Phoenix,
Arizona August 1992 stated that there was more behind the riots than the
public knows. He revealed that known agitators from the Revolutionary Communist
Party (RCP), Socialist WOrkers Party (SWP), Progressive Labor Party (PLP),
Socialist Organizing Network (SON), were there to press for a riot before
it started and some members of these organizations participated in the
rioting, looting, and arson.</P>

<P>He said that Mayor Bradley gave a very inflammatory statement that was
broadcast on L.A. T.V. before the riots. He states, what many Police Officers
already know, that Mayor Bradley has strongly supported the Communist Party
USA since he first ran for mayor. Also, he received support from the ACLU,
and the National Lawyers Guild (Both pro-Communist groups.) In his 1969
bid to become mayor his political manager was Communist Party functionary
Don Rothenberg. Gus Hall, the Director of the Communist Party U.S.A. came
to L.A&gt; to tell the Communists to help elect Bradley.</P>

<P>Some of our fellow Officers in Southern California believe, after evaluation
of the evidence and results, that the outcome of the trial was planned
by certain government officials and carried out with precision by the judge
and prosecutor. We believe they are right. How did they manipulate the
jury? (Read Aid &amp; Abet Police Newsletter Vol. 1, Num. 10, that addresses
the science of how this is accomplished.) There is no doubt that it was
understood what a NOT GUILTY verdict would accomplish. But, that's another
story. (See Aid &amp; Abet Vol. 2, Num.1 and Num2., which covers other
parts of this incredible well-laid plan for creating anarchy in the streets
and TERROR in the hearts of U.S. citizens. The goal: To get the citizens
to give up their Bill of Rights so that their government can make the streets
&quot;safe again&quot; through global government.)</P>

<P>BACK TO &quot;GETTING THEM GUNS!&quot;</P>

<P>Officers should keep in mind that some of the guns are not going to
be easily removed. For instance, those</P>

<P>-47-</P>

<P>owned by true patriots - those freedom-loving Americans who know, without
a doubt, what's coming next if they giver up their guns. It should not
be a surprise to Police Officers that many good Americans will not walk
meekly into NEW WORLD ORDER slavery. And there are a few Officers who would
want it any other way.</P>

<P>So the question each Officer individually must face is a very difficult
but realistic one: &quot;Which way will your own gun face when the orders
are issued?&quot; Will you protect the people you have sworn to protect?
Or, will you do what other patriotic officers from other countries have
done to their countrymen, &quot;obediently just follow orders&quot;?</P>

<P>Every Police Officer/Military soldier in every enslaved nation on earth
has had to face this same question. Certainly, it's an individual decision
whether or not to take lethal action against fellow countrymen when ordered
to take their weapons (and with them their liberty.) But, each Officer
WILL make that decision.</P>

<P>OFFICER, WILL YOU KILL FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHEN ORDERED TO TAKE THEIR
WEAPONS? Perhaps it will help that you will be told by superiors, &quot;It's
for the national good&quot;, and/or, &quot;It's for the good of society.&quot;
(History proves that the nations' Enforcers can expect some such motivational
indoctrination such as this.)</P>

<P>Could there be such a police action, taken against the public, if the
police were told the truth, i.e. &quot;that officers should take the guns
and liberties from the masses so that the Controlling Elite of the nation
can enslave them&quot;? We think not.</P>

<P>Why not? Because national Police Enforcers are not mercenaries; they
are always highly patriotic and would not do such a thing as enslaving
their countrymen, unless in some manner they were totally convinced that
it was the only thing to do to save their country,&quot; the &quot;patriotic&quot;
thing to do...&quot;FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY&quot; don't you know!</P>

<P>&quot;CRIMINALS&quot; EVERY ONE Actually, it may not be a difficult
decision for some Police Officers and National Guardsmen, because before
it</P>

<P>-48-</P>

<P>comes time to take the guns, all these terrible, &quot;radical RESISTERS
with those nasty guns&quot; will have been branded as &quot;CRIMINALS OF
THE STATE&quot;. And as you and I know, we have been trained that there
is little wrong with killing an armed and resisting &quot;criminal&quot;.
RIDICULOUS? Have you ever wondered exactly how governments throughout recent
history have gotten local and state Police Officers in other enslaved nations
to participate in executing their own citizens. This is accomplished by
labeling them &quot;criminals&quot;. (Piece of Cake!)</P>

<P>It is not a figment of someone's imagination that thousands of unarmed
fathers, mothers and children have been shot to death by their own local
police, while attempting to run or climb to freedom. It is through a process
of indoctrination that the very best Officers - highly patriotic Officers
- are brought to the point mentally where they can be counted on to do
such things. Remember, it is always accomplished by convincing the best
officers: &quot;It is a necessary and patriotic thing to do.&quot;</P>

<P>PATRIOTIC AMERICANS WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH</P>

<P>Police officers would do well not to see the above title as only part
of the script out of an old John Wayne movie.</P>

<P>We should consider, with utmost seriousness, that if good Americans
(including internal protectors) allow this plan of the Globalists to get
this far, it can be expected that casualties among Police Officers, National
guardsmen, and armed &quot;criminal&quot; patriotic citizens will be very
high before the gun removal process can be successfully completed. (If
indeed it can be completed.) But, with Police Officers and Guardsmen, and
armed &quot;criminal&quot; patriotic citizens will be very high before
the gun removal process can be successfully completed. (If indeed it can
be completed.) But, with Police Officers and Guardsmen serving as the &quot;cannon
fodder&quot; to enforce the Globalist plan, these deaths will be merely
&quot;acceptable loses&quot; to those giving the orders and looking down
from their safe and secure Ivory Towers.</P>

<P>It is therefore entirely relevant that our brothers and sisters decide
very soon which side they will serve in the setting up of this &quot;Utopian&quot;
Global Society. They must not be followed by government officials that
tell them that all men and women with American blood running through their
veins will walk gently into lifelong servitude.</P>

<P>It cannot be contradicted that a great many out there on the other end
of those half-billions &quot;Liberty Teeth&quot; (guns) still underscore
the statement of J.J. Rousseau:</P>

<P>-49-</P>

<P>&quot;I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery.&quot;</P>

<P>INTELLIGENT Americans read and study history. On the other hand, the
vast majority of government &quot;leaders&quot;, &quot;educators&quot;
and media persons apparently don't! Concerning the 2nd Amendment, for example,
they try to tell us that the Founding Fathers meant for only the Organized
Militia (National Guard) to have weapons. Please read the quotes given
below and decide: Could these countrymen have spoken any more plainly?</P>

<P>&quot;NO FREE MAN SHALL EVER BE DE-BARRED THE USE OF ARMS. THE STRONGEST
REASON FOR THE PEOPLE TO RETAIN THEIR RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS IS AS
A LAST RESORT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST TYRANNY IN GOVERNMENT.&quot;
- THOMAS JEFFERSON</P>

<P>&quot;THE SAID CONSTITUTION SHALL NEVER BE CONSTRUED TO AUTHORIZE CONGRESS
TO PREVENT THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE PEACEABLE CITIZENS FROM
KEEPING THEIR OWN ARMS.&quot; - SAM ADAMS</P>

<P>&quot;THE GREAT OBJECT IS THAT EVERY MAN BE ARMED. EVERYONE WHO IS ABLE
MAY HAVE A GUN.&quot; - PATRICK HENRY</P>

<P>&quot;AMERICANS NEED NEVER FEAR THEIR GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGE
OF BEING ARMED, WHICH THE AMERICANS POSSESS OVER THE PEOPLE OF ALMOST EVERY
OTHER NATION.&quot; - JAMES MADISON</P>

<P>Well now, those statements are really ambiguous aren't they?! Don't
you wish our Founders would have stated clearly what was on their minds?</P>

<P>Why are our school children lied to by Establishment educators about
this? You know the answer, don't you? Good NWO slaves will not need guns.
And that is exactly what our children will have to look forward to if American
Police Officers and National Guardsmen don't say &quot;NO&quot; TO THE
NEW WORLD ORDER.</P>

<P>Here are several other statements about the importance of guns in the
hands of the masses:</P>

<P>VLADIMIR I. LENIN: &quot;...one of the basic conditions for the victory
of socialism is the arming of the workers (Communist) and the disarming
of the bourgeoisie (the middle class).&quot;</P>

<P><A NAME="-50-"></A>-50-</P>

<P>GEORGE KEENAN, 1964: &quot;Popular revolt against a ruthless, experienced
modern dictatorship, which enjoys a MONOPOLY OVER WEAPONS and COMMUNICATIONS,...is
simply not a possibility in the modern age.&quot; (U.S. conspirators already
control the major communication sources, now they have to - GET THE GUNS!)</P>

<P>LEO TOLSTOY, 1893: &quot;Governments need armies to protect them against
their enslaved and oppressed subjects.&quot;</P>

<P>And one of our own:</P>

<P>PROFESSOR DEAN MORRIS, Government employee, Director of Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (LEAA), in testimony to Congress stated: &quot;I
am one who believes that as a first step the U.S. should move expeditiously
to disarm the civilian population, other than police and security officers,
of all handguns, pistols and revolvers...no one should have a right to
anonymous ownership or use of a gun.&quot;</P>

<P>His government LEAA administration would later publish, &quot;There
can be no right of privacy in regard to armament...We seek a disarmed populace.&quot;</P>

<P>Our government now tell us that they &quot;disbanded&quot; LEAA.</P>

<P>FACT: They removed the name and address, but every tenant of the LEAA
program is still in place and the goal and time table is precisely on course.
(See book, U.S. Centralization of Police Powers.)</P>

<P>Who was it that said these words?</P>

<P>&quot;If the opposition (citizen) disarms, well and good. If it refuses
to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.&quot; All those Officers who answered,
&quot;Pete WIlson&quot;, &quot;George Bush&quot;, &quot;Willie Clinton&quot;,
or &quot;Ross Perot&quot;, you are wrong. It was actually JOSEF STALIN.
A simple mistake!</P>

<P>Perhaps as a last HURRAH in closing this section on U.S. citizens retaining
their guns, we should heed the cry of a recent victim of anti-gun legislation.
In 1990, a female student from Beijing, Red China, described her partner's
last words to her:</P>

<P>&quot;Tell the American people never to loose their guns. As long as
they keep their guns in their hands, what happened here will never happen
there.&quot; (Amen!)</P>

<P>-50-</P>

<P>REMEMBER, IT CAN'T WORK WITHOUT YOU</P>

<P>Now realize that for any plan, that would subjugate Americans, to have
any chance to succeed, the people's protectors must go against their solemn
oath, turn on the people, and assist other seditionists and traitors in
such criminal acts. So we must ask our fellow Officer again, &quot;Will
they be like those who have used pathetic statement such as, &quot;WELL,
IT'S THE LAW, SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENFORCE IT.&quot;?</P>

<P>As many Officers know, that has been the lame excuse offered by the
People's &quot;Protectors&quot; in all the Marxist nations of the world
during the last 75 years of totalitarian rule.</P>

<P>Fine, dedicated, HIGHLY PATRIOTIC (and brainwashed) police officers
by the millions UPHELD THE &quot;LAW&quot; in these other countries, and
went on to round up and execute 170 million of their own countrymen because
they were told by their leaders that &quot;to save their nation&quot; they
must do these things.</P>

<P>HOW COULD THEY DO THAT? Every time a nation's officers have committed
such acts against their own people it was because of their deep patriotism
that they were easily brainwashed into believing these types of activities
were in the nation's best interest. (Of course, as mentioned earlier, these
170 million people were labeled &quot;CRIMINALS&quot; of the state.)</P>

<P>&quot;BUT I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS&quot;, has always been the most
popular &quot;last words&quot; of obedient government officers. Least we
forget Nuremberg!</P>

<P>-52-</P>

<P>&quot;BUT, IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE&quot;, some will say. Let me tell you
that it is already happening here, and many officers know it. It is now
well known that Governor Pete Wilson has just declared 500,000 plus good
Americans to be &quot;felons&quot; - CRIMINALS OF THE STATE- for not obeying
his unconstitutional gun restrictions by March 30th of 1992. The U.S. Congress,
and some other states and cities are in the process of doing the same thing.
REMEMBER, we already spoke about how much easier it is to kill armed &quot;criminals&quot;?
And so it begins.</P>

<P>PEOPLE'S PROTECTORS ARE AWAKENING!</P>

<P>Be of good cheer! All over this nation Officers, Guardsmen and military
personnel are awakening to this oncoming planned disaster. Many are beginning
to take a stand against the NEW WORLD ORDER Bloodsuckers. They now understand
that if they do not side with the people, but allow themselves to be used
to enslave the masses, the will become the ENEMY, KEEPERS, and EXECUTIONERS
of their own countrymen.</P>

<P>WILL OUR &quot;OPERATION VAMPIRE KILLER 2000&quot; PLAN WORK?</P>

<P>WHO ARE YOU? by A. Rick Dalton</P>

<P>Fellow Officer: Have you ever considered just who you are? Do you realize
that you are the &quot;thin blue line&quot; between civilized society and
lawlessness? You have been entrusted with the collective right to self-protection
for thousands of American citizens who depend on you. You and I are, in
our own sphere of operations and influence, among the most important and
powerful people on earth!</P>

<P>We have had awesome give to us, and we must never forget that we are,
first and foremost, DEFENDERS, not PUNISHERS of the people. We must honor
and hold sacred the God-given rights of the people which we defend. And
we must use our influence, our discretion and sometimes our authority to
protect these inalienable rights.</P>

<P><A NAME="-53-"></A>-53-</P>

<P>Our plan to shut down the Establishment's NWO Slave State by re-educating
and returning the patriotic People's Servants and Protectors to the side
of the People is working as we speak. Here is a fine example.</P>

<P>A PERSONAL TESTIMONY</P>

<P>Let this old cop relate one of many recent, memorable meetings I've
had with fellow patriot Police Officers and Guardsmen. I was a guest speaker
at the Seattle, Washington Preparedness Expo in 1991, which drew a crowd
of 5,000 plus concerned Americans. At each of my talks there were many
fine federal, state and local police officers and military persons in the
audience. I was privileged to meet a number of these good patriot Officers
and to be able to speak with them after my speeches.</P>

<P>I recall in particular two Officers who worked as partners for the local
police department. I can't tell you how impressed I was with their expression
of their love for their fellow Americans and their country. They promised
me that they would go forward from the Expo, study and share their knowledge
and concerns with their police colleagues. As the reader will soon see,
they did exactly that. Read below the first published article written by
these two grand American Police Officers, and addressed to their peers.</P>

<P>WE HAVE THE POWER</P>

<P>Officers A.J. Seitz and Mike Lewis Puyallup Police Department, WA.</P>

<P>Mike writes:</P>

<P>When A.J. and I first informed people that were going to start writing
an article on the U.S. Constitution, we received mixed responses. Some
of our fellow officers were sharpening their pencils preparing to write
a rebuttal until they saw the piece (no, not A.J.'s HK-91. I'm talking
about the article.) The article was primarily written as an opening statement
just to get the ball rolling and hopefully make people probe into their
beliefs and ideals. Several comments were made as to whether we wore white
hoods when we wrote the article.</P>

<P>-54-</P>

<P>We neither support nor condone the activities of the K.K.K. or any other
similar organization. What we do believe in is the U.S. Constitution and
the Bill of RIghts. This is something that every officer has sworn to protect
and serve. Yet, it's amazing the number of people, officers included, that
really don't know what the Bill of Rights contain and where it is applicable
in the field of Law Enforcement. How many of you can recite the first,
second, fourth, fifth, sixth and the eighth amendment if asked by a citizen?
These listed are primarily used in our profession. Of course, we all have
some idea that freedom of speech, religion and search and seizure are in
there somewhere, but most are not exactly sure what else is in there. We
all know that the Constitution and Bill of Rights supersedes all other
laws. It gives the people the right to govern themselves as they see fit.
It was our founding fathers' goal to not have a totalitarian state such
as England. How many of us have been dismayed over the passage of a new
law, with the knowledge that the act would not be practical on the street,
or just does not sound quite legal? All we do is bitch or enforce it unquestionably.
It goes no further than that. We as a people (especially police officers)
have a great amount of power. Let's begin to use it! We want you only to
have an open mind, which for some will be tough, I know. Do something for
yourself. LIFE MAGAZINE has a special Fall edition solely based on the
Bill of Rights. Take one home (Well, pay for it first!) and read it. You'd
be surprised at what you find. Plus it will be great for you kids' future
history papers. All we ask is that you search you own soul and question
yourself if you are upholding the people's right, or are you upholding
the Federal and State Legislative wishes.</P>

<P>A.J. writes:</P>

<P>As Officer Lewis said above, some people, including officers, fell that
when a person uses the Bill of Rights as supportive material to an argument
on a social issue, then that person must be a radical. Perhaps if you are
pro-government control, I guess you're right. However, were our founding
fathers radicals against the English government when they were fighting
for our freedom? Since we are discussing the right of the people to govern
themselves, fellow officer label us &quot;right wing extremists.&quot;</P>

<P>This brings us to the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights: &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press,
or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances.&quot; This has been said to be the cornerstone
of all other rights, yet this right seems to be constantly under attack
by politicians who owe allegiance to special interest groups, as in the
political correctness issue.</P>

<P>-55-</P>

<P>This has obviously irritated the citizens of this country, which can
been seen by the recent election across the nation, where several special
interest politicians were voted out of office, and in our own state where
term limitations nearly passed.</P>

<P>One of the reasons that the government is in the this state (excessive
taxation, creating tighter government control, and any of the other topics
people complain about) is that the people have little knowledge about the
history of our government. One example is the Sedition law. In 1797, John
Adams, a Federalist, beat Thomas Jefferson, a Republican, by three votes
for the presidency. In 1978, Jefferson and Madison opposed an imminent
war with France. The Federalists, who had close ties with the Plutocrats
(rule by the wealthy) in England, passed the sedition law. Bouviers law
dictionary defines sedition as &quot;a revolt against legitimate authority,
the raising of commotions and disturbances in the state or advocacy or
suggestion by word, act, or writing of public disorder or resistance to
the government&quot;. The idea behind sedition is that the government has
the right to protect itself against disgruntled citizens. This sounds great
on the surface until you remember that, as stated in the Declaration of
Independence, Bill of Rights, and the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Government
is a government of, for and by the PEOPLE.</P>

<P>The first victim of this law was Matthew Lyons, a member of the Vermont
Congress and reporter of a Vermond newspaper. He accused Adams of setting
himself in a position of king of the people. Lyons soon found himself imprisoned,
as did many other politicians, writers, and anyone else who dared suggest
they could govern themselves or speak out against Adams and fellow Federalists.
Jefferson labeled the law as the &quot;Alien Friends Act&quot; and persuaded
Kentucky and Virginia to pass resolutions against the law. As the people
of the New Nation began to rally against Adams, the Federalists and the
sedition law. In 1800, Jefferson won election to the presidency by a landslide
and Federalists slowly left, apparently in name only. The citizens now
lived in freedom once again, but only for a short period of time.</P>

<P>In the 1940's, a group called the American Firsters began to oppose
President Roosevelt, the New Deal, the government ties with the Soviet
Union, and inparticular, going to war with Germany. The FDR administration,
with help from a reporter from the Washington Post, entrapped 28 people.
Using an alias, the reporter ordered books, pamphlets, etc. and had them
sent to Washington D.C.. The 28 defendants were indicted, arrested and
taken to Washington D.C. on sedition charges. After four years Chief Justice
Laws stated, &quot;This is a travesty upon justice,...case dismissed.&quot;
Although the government did not win the case, they</P>

<P>-56-</P>

<P>did succeed in running the defendants financially and in scaring anyone
else who would oppose the current administration.</P>

<P>On Feb. 16, 1988 at Fort Smith, Arkansas, the government again indicted
14 individuals on sedition charges. After 110 witnesses for the state,
1200 pieces of visual evidence, and 8 weeks of trial, all defendants were
found innocent.</P>

<P>The other tool the federal government uses is &quot;conspiracy to commit
RICCO&quot;. The only evidence required is for someone to say that they
discussed a commission of a crime with another, just like in Orwell's novel,
&quot;1984&quot;. Interesting! Just think, you can be imprisoned for thought
crimes. This is not new. It's been developing since the country started.
If certain professional politicians had their way, they would control everything.</P>

<P>Another example is the media. We're not saying that we support either
of these professionals, but look at the difference in standards. During
the Louisiana governor's race, established professional politicians, with
a lot of help from mass media, succeeded in lambasting David Duke's campaign
and yet the same media censored Gary Trudeau's editorial cartoon depicting
allegations of Dan Quayle and a DEA file. Nothing obscene or disgusting,
but an issue that the people deserve to hear. What happened to unbiased
news?</P>

<P>We realize these things are far removed from the issues we deal with
on the street, but you have to stop and think. If the federal government
tries to make these terror tactics and harassment seems like &quot;the
end justifies the means&quot;, it has to make us justify any tactic we
may use to make an arrest (or dare I say &quot;A STAT)&quot; no matter
what rights we may bend or break.</P>

<P>Remember, we have the power to protect these rights that were given
to us all, even to street cops. Those of you who have had I.A.'s should
know best. Citizens deserve no less protection of their rights than what
you got, or at least what you should have gotten. - End</P>

<P>(Note: Research material was taken from the documentary videotape, &quot;Sedition
USSA&quot;, by Video Truth Network, and the Fall issue of LIFE MAGAZINE.)</P>

<P>Editor McLamb continues:</P>

<P>You see, since most Cops are highly patriotic, the truth about what
is wrong with America, can spread like wildfire among the ranks. And officers
like A.J. and Mike who are definitely</P>

<P>-57-</P>

<P>two Police Officers &quot;Against the New World Order&quot;, are starting
the fire in the bosom of their fellow officers. I wish to commend and thank
both these wonderful young officers for their patriotism and efforts to
save our nation. As usual, they are taking a bit of heat, but that is the
price of liberty and true leadership today. As my dear friend Col. Bo Gritz
says...&quot; If you're over the target, you are going to take flak.&quot;</P>

<P>These Officers have since written other articles and are working hard
to educate our colleagues in their state. Think of how many of our fellow
Officers they will reach, educate and turn back to serving the People of
our nation. And then how many of the officers A.J. and Mike educate will
in turn reach out to touch other Officers and Guardsmen across their state,
and other states. And so it goes and grows. We, who call ourselves &quot;POLICE
AGAINST THE NEW WORLD ORDER&quot; are growing in number as in geometric
progression. Every patriotic officer whom we can awaken becomes a &quot;force
of one' that can have a great impact on many others, who will then have
an impact on others. There are over 4,500 Police and National Guardsmen
on our educational, constitutional Air &amp; Abet Police Newsletter. We
&quot;ENFORCERS&quot; have the potential of stopping this treasonous Global
Government scam very quickly. Remember,</P>

<P>&quot;IF OFFICERS DON'T ENFORCE TREASON, IT WON'T GET ENFORCED&quot;?</P>

<P>This editor is humbled by the love and devotion to &quot;We The People&quot;
of the many federal, state and local officers and Guardsmen with whom I
am in communication across America. I am fortunate to be able to work and
communicate daily with our nation's greatest assets - its Patriots. - End.</P>

<P>Officer Jack McLamb, (Ret) Editor/Publisher, Aid &amp; Abet Police Newsletter.
P.O. Box 8787, Phx. AZ. 85066</P>

<P><A NAME="-58-"></A>-58-</P>

<P>VAMPIRE KILLER 2000 IS WORKING</P>

<P>More than ever before we, as Police Officers, National Guardsmen and
Soldiers, are learning the truth about America's enemies and remembering
whom it was we swore to protect and serve, the &quot;SYSTEM&quot; or the
PEOPLE?</P>

<P>It was once said, &quot;MAN CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS&quot;. Indeed,
we cannot!</P>

<P>BUT WHICH OATH?</P>

<P>This is a confidential letter from a government Officer that does not
want to be identified. Therefore, we must write this message with this
in mind. A federal officer, to whom we have given the code name &quot;G&quot;,
told us recently that &quot;G&quot; was part of a new federal action team
that was formed for a very important reason. &quot;G&quot; stated that
this &quot;action team&quot; is extremely well trained. It is equipped
with the newest technology and can respond to any type of &quot;emergency&quot;
over a large area. &quot;G's&quot; concern is that none of these &quot;action
teams&quot; members across the nation has been given an oath of officer.
They have not sworn to protect any Constitution, people or government.
This Officer wonders if perhaps these groups of highly trained men and
women are to be used for something UNAMERICAN.</P>

<P>Could it be that these men and women are to take another type of oath,
possibly this one?:</P>

<P>-59-</P>

<P>&quot;I solemnly affirm to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience
the functions entrusted to me as a member of the international service
of the United Nations, to discharge those functions and regulate my conduct
with the interest of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or
accept instructions in respect to the performance of my duties from any
government or other authority external to the organization.&quot; - UNITED
NATIONS' LOYALTY OATH.</P>

<P>Could this be the oath of all U.S. officers will take in the near future?
Have some already taken it? Must we reiterate what our illustrious traitor/President
Bush stated in front of the UN building Feb. 1, 1992,...that we officers
would swear an oath to this &quot;SACRED&quot; organization in the future??</P>

<P>(So we don't appear biased, let us restate that Clinton and Perot are
NWO clones, and if given a chance they would do the exact same thing.)</P>

<P>The Federal Officer above is not the first person that has informed
us that the Oath of Allegiance is being attacked. Several have reported
changes. Some refer to subtle changes in their State oaths that have been
appearing in recent months. All such attempts must be challenged.</P>

<P>PROTECTING &quot;THE SYSTEM&quot; FROM THE MASSES</P>

<P>Recapping what we said earlier: In Communist countries the SYSTEM or
GROUP is always held in higher regard than the individual citizen. The
alert observer will have noticed that America has now accepted this same
political philosophy. In a true free nation the INDIVIDUAL</P>

<P>-60-</P>

<P>is protected over the group or the system. A Constitutional Republic
is a system of government which protects each individual, and thereby protects
the whole. A Democracy is Mob Rule. It protects the group or mob over the
individual, crushing the individual, if necessary, to protect the group.
A Lynch Mob is a prime example of a Democracy...'The Lynchee does not want
to get hung, the Lynchors want to hang the Lynchee, so they have a vote.&quot;
A perfect Democracy!</P>

<P>You see, friends and colleagues, the enemies of our Republic, lurking
inside our government, have a very big problem. They assume that officers,
after going through our U.S. socialistic/humanistic government schools
and government police academies, are now psychologically prepared to do
ANYTHING they are ordered to do regardless, to protect &quot;the system&quot;
from the masses. As mentioned earlier, this is always sold to them as &quot;DOING
THEIR PATRIOTIC DUTY&quot;. This Enemy has for years applied the same program
of indoctrination to the Police Officers of other nations, and with great
success. They are now convinced that our fellow Officers, having undergone
a similar type of indoctrination, will now make it work here in America
as well. Many Officers, if asked, would say THEY ARE WRONG!</P>

<P>-61-</P>

<P>What these One Worlders don't understand is that Americans are different
from the &quot;subjects&quot; of collectivist empire nations. The fact
is, for generations we have tasted the elixir of something called personal
INDEPENDENCE and LIBERTY, the likes of which no other people in history
have ever known. Let us share with you one of our favorite quotes from
our 2nd President, John Adams:</P>

<P>&quot;YOUR HAVE RIGHTS ANTECEDENT TO ALL EARTHLY GOVERNMENTS; RIGHTS
THAT CANNOT BE REPEALED OR RESTRAINED BY HUMAN LAWS; RIGHTS DERIVED FROM
THE GREAT LEGISLATOR OF THE UNIVERSE.&quot;</P>

<P>But of course the international &quot;Elitists&quot; like Bush, Clinton,
Perot, Kennedy, Rockefeller, Brezhinsky, Hammer, etc. have a difficult
time relating to this, due to the fact that most have never actually given
100% allegiance to any nation.</P>

<P>Over the last 100 years these Internationalist have slowly drained some,
if not all, of this patriotism and independence out of some of our people.
But, let them beware. They are in for a big surprise if they think the
majority of our people, inside or outside our government, are now ready
for the harness of servitude under their &quot;beneficent&quot; IMPERIAL
U.N. RULE.</P>

<P>DO YOU HEAR THAT, YOU INTERNATIONALIST BLOOD-SUCKERS? Those whom you
think will do you dastardly biddings without question (Police, National
Guardsmen and Military) give you good warning: The battle to enslave the
American people is not won! Not by a long shot!</P>

<P><A NAME="-62-"></A>-62-</P>

<P>ENEMY'S WORST NIGHTMARE</P>

<P>Pushing hard for their vision of a collectivist, &quot;utopian&quot;
New World Order, the behind the scenes controllers of Clinton, Bush and
Perot undoubtedly have as their worst nightmare the prospect that you,
their ENFORCERS, might awaken and return to the side of the People. Their
plan cannot succeed unless you will act without thinking, not understanding
how they will manipulate and use you to implement their plan for world
conquest. Think about it: Whatever would they do, if you, because of your
strong patriotism, decide to do nothing more than uphold your oath of service
and protection to the People of America and JUST SAY &quot;NO&quot;? What
could they do?</P>

<P>GREAT POWER IN YOUR HANDS</P>

<P>Have you ever desired great power? Dear Officer, Guardsmen, Soldier,
you already have GREAT POWER!! The secret enemies now in control of America
know of your great power, even if you don't. That is why they will do anything
to stop you from learning about your power. They cannot allow you to be
awakened, because they know that if you, our nation's INTERNAL PROTECTORS,
turn from being Enforcers of the SYSTEM, and return to being</P>

<P>-63-</P>

<P>PROTECTORS of the PEOPLE, there is no way they can pull off their coup.</P>

<P>&quot;MAKE YOURSELVES SHEEP AND THE WOLVES WILL EAT YOU&quot;</P>

<P>This admonition is one given by our good brother and RIght Honorable
Top Cop, Professor James Jarrett of Phoenix. May it serve to lead us into
the last main point we wish to leave with you - something we hope you will
remember above all else.</P>

<P>As stated earlier, these treacherous Internationalists absolutely cannot
accomplish their goals without the nation's Enforcers aiding &amp; abetting
their treasonous, unconstitutional mandates. But, they know also that for
the most part if they can label certain patriotic Americans as &quot;criminals&quot;,
most of our fellow Police Officers will respond accordingly and treat them
as such. This is presently occurring in many areas. IRS Director, Donald
Alexander, admitted to Congress 20 years ago, &quot;We now have so many
regulations that everyone is guilty of some violation.&quot; Imagine what
it's like today.</P>

<P>Another such attempt, is not only to label as &quot;criminals&quot;
those who refuse to relinquish or register weapons of personal defense,
but also all those Americans who wish to exercise their Constitutionally
guaranteed right to dissent or speak out. Such as we officers have done
in this publication and we do regularly through the AID &amp; ABET Police
Newsletter. (Note: Aid &amp; Abet Police Newsletter is available to Internal
Protectors and private citizens by writing to P.O. Box 8787, Phx. Az. 85066.)</P>

<P>There is ample evidence from testimonies of readers/Officers from various
parts of the country, to show that this move is already begun. But, this
labeling of good Americans as &quot;criminals&quot; cannot succeed without
the full cooperation of the 1,000,000-plus American Police Officers and
National Guardsmen.</P>

<P>Keep in mind the following:</P>

<P>THERE IS NO WAY WE CAN LOSE IN THIS STRUGGLE TO SAVE OUR GREAT REPUBLIC,
IF WE AMERICAN &quot;INTERNAL PROTECTORS&quot; WILL DO WHAT WE MUST DO,
AND THAT IS TO UPHOLD OUR OATH OF OFFICE TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE FROM ALL
ENEMIES.</P>

<P>It does sound simple, does it not?</P>

<P>-64-</P>

<P>SOMETIMES &quot;DISORDER&quot; IS GOOD</P>

<P>As Protectors of the People, let us involve ourselves now and for the
future in bringing DISorder to the &quot;New World Order&quot; by committing
ourselves this day along side Thomas Jefferson to this wonderful pledge:</P>

<P>&quot;I have sworn upon the altar of Almighty God eternal hostility
against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&quot;</P>

<P>For those of our brothers and sisters who have children, this very evening
quietly sneak in and look down into the small faces of your posterity and
ask yourselves this question: Can there be a greater work that to save
our nation for these little ones? Working together with our fellow countrymen,
we can place the final stake through the heart of this Parasitic Beast
that has gripped our once vibrant nation by the throat. In so doing, we
will secure for ourselves, our children and grandchildren, a grand and
marvelous future.</P>

<P><A NAME="-65-"></A>-65-</P>

<P>HOW CAN YOU PLAY A PART IN OUR NATION'S RECOVERY?</P>

<P>EACH OFFICER OR NATIONAL GUARDSMAN THAT WISHES TO BECOME A PART OF THE
RECOVERY OF OUR NATION MUST START WITH EDUCATION. BUT, BECAUSE OF THE LATENESS
OF THE HOUR, IT MUST BE DONE QUICKLY. EACH OFFICER MUST KNOW JUST WHAT
ARE THE PROBLEMS AND HOW ONE OFFICER CAN HELP.</P>

<P>1) Start by sharing this publication with every Police Officer, National
Guardsman and Soldier you know and ask them to do the same. Ordering a
subscription to AID &amp; ABET POLICE NEWSLETTER is another must so that
you can communicate with other likeminded patriot Officers. Also there
are very important seminar tapes that have much vital information. Through
this exposure you will learn of many other fine publications, persons and
groups that can help you grow. (See order information at back of this publication.)
NOTE: Secondary targets for this manual. All Fed..State and local Government
officials, school board members, teachers, ministers, neighbors.</P>

<P>-66-</P>

<P>2) This next change will be hard for certain colleagues. But, trust
us on this one. You must seek out those whom the government says are using
the Constitution to destroy our nation. We told you this would be a tough
one!</P>

<P>There are indeed groups that were set up to use the U.S. Constitution
to destroy America, such as the ACLU. We speak only of those Americans
whom the government and media &quot;attack&quot; vehemently. Those who
are presently risking incarceration daily to try to awaken the American
People to the traitors in our government. This is the group that government
and the controlled media have labeled as &quot;evil&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot;,
&quot;right-wing fanatics&quot;, &quot;violence-prone&quot;, &quot;unAmerican&quot;,
&quot;hatemongers&quot;,&quot;radicals&quot;, etc., etc. Yes, these great
AMERICAN PATRIOTS are listed as &quot;PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE&quot; by
our government. Can you guess why that is? It is because they are the ONLY
PEOPLE IN OUR NATION who are fighting the NEW WORLD ORDER. In truth, they
are none of the horrible things our government and the media say they are.
Trust your fellow Officers on this until you have met these great Americans
yourself. If we are wrong, then you will know it very quickly. Is that
not so?</P>

<P>These wonderful &quot;crazy&quot; Americans meet in small group all
across our nation every week, to non-violently plan and work to save our
nation through education from the terrible tragedy of Internationalism/globalism
and the likes. These people are not the wealthy. They, like police officers,
are the working class. Theirs is the spirit that made America the greatest
nation on earth! They have heart and they have love; and all of them love
Freedom. But, make no mistake, they are not &quot;weak&quot;. If need by,
they will indeed go to war against those who try to enslave them, their
families and their fellow Americans.</P>

<P>ATTEND MEETINGS. Go to as many of their meetings as possible and learn.
Even though they many at first be suspect of you (as a government officers),
get with them, and tell them you truly love America and want to be knowledgeable
of what is occurring in your country and want to help. They will teach
you, as they have taught the officers who have put together this publication,
and many other American protectors. These patriots know our nation's founding
principles, know what went wrong and how to fix America.</P>

<P>-67-</P>

<P>3) Officer if you believe in prayer, do pray! Pray that the Lord will
lead you as HE is presently leading many of your fellow officers to know
what role you can play in the recovery of our nation. Your police colleagues
give you this guarantee: If you are sincere, you will get an answer.</P>

<P>4) Write to us. We are your brothers and sisters in law enforcement
and we love you. We truly do!</P>

<P>That may sound strange to you Macho Cops, but we mean it. Those that
know us know we mean it. Have you ever been in a foxhole with the bullets
flying all around? Or in a commercial building on night shift, doing a
burglary check when several big Bad Guys came out of the dark? Did you
not love him who protected your backside? Get the point? You know exactly
what we mean. Honestly, it is past time that we show our brotherly love
for our countrymen.</P>

<P>We're here as your support. You're going to need it if you decide to
stand up for your fellow Americans. Write, let us know what is on your
mind and in your heart. Some of us, your colleagues, have been through
a living hell in order to keep serving and protecting the People from all
enemies. Sharing the truth found in this publication with your fellow officers
will not be popular among some within your agencies. Remember, there is
little you will go through that we have not already experienced. Let us
help. Together, we are strong!</P>

<P>THAT'S ALL FOR NOW!</P>

<P>It is indeed just that simple. STUDY but don't take all day about it.
Go to those who know. If you can't find a group of involved, knowledgeable,
patriotic Americans write to us and we will connect you with some fine
Patriots in your area.</P>

<P>America's government and the freedoms it gives are an acclaimed wonder
throughout the world. Why has our constitution served us so well? The bedrock
was the Christian worldview of those who founded this Country.</P>

<P><A NAME="-68-"></A>-68-</P>

<P>BATTLE CRY</P>

<P>The most important quote in promoting this plan of recovery for our
nation is this one by Sir Winston Churchill. In a sense it is the Battle
Cry of all FREE MEN. It is the battle cry of POLICE AGAINST THE NEW WORLD
ORDER:</P>

<P>&quot;Still, if you will not fight for the right when you can easily
win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be
sure and not so costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to
fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance for survival.
There may be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no chance
of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.&quot;
- Winston Churchill</P>

<P><A NAME="-69-"></A>-69-</P>

<P>DOCUMENTS AND PLANS</P>

<P>The following are a few documents that point out the plans of those
whose goal it is to destroy America.</P>

<P>-70-</P>

<P>The Hegelian Principle</P>

<P>Revolutionaries in government have created economic chaos, shortages
in food and fuel, confiscatory taxation, a crisis in education, the threat
of war, and other diversions to condition Americans for &quot;The New World
Order.&quot;</P>

<P>The technique is as old as politics itself. It is the Hegelian principle
of bringing about change in a three-step process: Thesis. Antithesis and
Synthesis.</P>

<P>The first step (thesis) is to create a problem. The second step (antithesis)
is to generate opposition to the problem (fear, panic,hysteria). The third
step (synthesis) is to offer the solution to the problem created in step
one, -change which would have been impossible to impose on the people without
the proper psychological conditioning achieved in stages one and two.</P>

<P>Applying the Hegelian principle, and irresistible financial influence,
concealed mattoids seek to dismantle social and political structures by
which free men govern themselves - ancient landmarks erected at great cost
in blood and treasure.</P>

<P>Their objective is to emasculate sovereign states, merge nation under
universal government, centralize economic powers, and control the world's
people and resources. -71-</P>

<P>See Picture #4a/4b</P>

<P>REGIONAL GOVERNMENT UPDATE 1987</P>

<P>The country is partitioned off into 10 &quot;regions&quot;. The most
bold black lines delineate the ten section (regions), each having its own
&quot;capital&quot;. The less bold lines depict the replacement for countries.
They are called U.M.J.O.s (Umbrella Multi Jurisdictional Organizations).
Every state has been so recast. The finest lines are the present country
structure that is &quot;planned&quot; to be abolished! -Bernadine Smith</P>

<P>President Nixon on 3-27-69 through the Government Reorganization Act
divided the United States into ten Regions. To further implement this Regional
Governance over the U.S.A., President Nixon signed Executive Order 11649
and entered it in the Federal Register Feb. 12,1972. (Vo. 37, No. 30)</P>

<P>Through the authority vested in him as President of the U.S., he established
a Federal Regional Council for each of the ten standard regions. It stated
that, the President shall designate one member of each such Council as
Chairman of that Council and such chairman shall serve at the pleasure
of the President.</P>

<P>-72-</P>

<P>STATES BEING ABOLISHED</P>

<P>Study the constitution of your state. You may find that your state constitution
no longer describes the boundaries of the state-effectively abolishing
the state. At last check, the only states that still lay out their boundaries
in their constitutions are Washington, Idaho, Montana, North and South
Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Kansas,
Arizona, New Mexico and Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Florida.</P>

<P>See Picture #5</P>

<P>Only the states marked with a slash still retain state boundaries which
are still specified in their State Constitutions. When the State borders
are no longer in the State Constitution, it is the signal that the State
has lost its sovereignty (and its State Citizens). Now a CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
HAS BEEN FORMED WHICH IS THE STEP INTO INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM THROUGH
THE UNITED NATIONS...WAKE UP AMERICA!</P>

<P>Vote Down Home Rule! THIS IS A DESIGNED AND PLANNED POLITICAL REVOLUTION.
This is being done through the ballot box to destroy out State Constitutions
and State Governments while we are kept busy fighting brush fires and fanning
windmills on lesser matters of importance or of no significance.</P>

<P>Obtain a copy of your present State Constitution and a copy of my proposed
changed of your State Constitution. The perpetrators of Regional and World
Government well know this. They well know that the STATE GOVERNMENTS WILL
HAVE TO BE ABOLISHED BEFORE THEY CAN FORCE REGIONAL, METROPOLITAN AND WORLD
GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES-This has already been done in 30 of the
50 states!</P>

<P>Friday, October 2nd, 1992 Chaos has descended in &quot;Carandiru,&quot;
the biggest penitentiary complex in South America. Over a hundred inmates
dead and hundreds injured on the massacre. The police arrived with helicopters
and over two hundred armed forces. They took the jailblock called &quot;Pavilhao
Nove&quot; and opened fire on the inmates in a holocaust method of annihilation.
The government of the city of Sao Paulo cannot control the brutality of
its police. Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet.
The bodies were filled with bullets and bites from the police dogs. The
police try to hide the massacre saying there were only eight deaths. The
violence of Brazilian cops is very well known outside of Brazil, This kind
of extermination is a method that they use to get rid of the overpopulation
in the jails. The violence of the cops left the whole pavilion destroyed
after the rebellion.</P>

<P>BIG BROTHER WANTS TO LOOK INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT (Any Time It Pleases)</P>

<P>The US Government is constructing a system to track all financial transactions
in realtime-ostensibly to catch drug traffickers, terrorists, and financial
criminals. Does that leave you with the warm fuzzies-or scare you out of
your wits?</P>

<P>By Anthony L. Kimery ascii'ed by The P/\NTHER -TRZ/TRSI/UMF-</P>

<P>There wasn't much to go on. The Police salvaged the slip of paper that
a small time East Coast drug dealer tried to eat before being arrested,
but on it they found scribbled only a &quot;John.&quot; This frustrated
the police. They had anticipated more incriminating information on the
man they believed was the supplier not only to the dealer they'd just busted,
but also to dozens of other street corner crack peddlers.</P>

<P>With two slim leads, the police weren't technically equipped to do much
more than antiquated detective work that probably wouldn't yield evidence
they could use to indict John. So they turned to the quasi-secretive, federal
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for the digital sleuthing
they needed.</P>

<P>Less than 45 minutes after receiving the official police request for
help, FinCEN had retrieved enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing from
government databases that the district attorney prosecuting the case was
able to seek indictments against John on charges of money laundering and
conspiracy to traffic narcotics. The local police were impressed.</P>

<P>Launched with a low-key champagne reception at the Treasury Department
in April 1990, FinCEN is the US government's (perhaps the world's) most
effective financial crime investigation unit. Even Russian President Boris
Yeltsin asked for its help in locating stolen Communist Party funds. This
start-of-the-art computer-snooping agency is quietly tucked away under
the auspices of the Treasury Department. Its mission is to map the digital
trails of dirty money, be it the laundered profits from drug sales , stolen
S&amp;L, loot, hidden political slush funds, or the financing conduits
of terrorists. It's the only federal unit devoted solely to the systematic
collation and cross-analysis of law enforcement, intelligence, and public
databases.</P>

<P>Until August 1993, FinCEN headquarters was an old Social Security Administration
building with a ceiling ravaged by asbestos abatement crews, but that didn't
seem to faze director Brian Bruh (he retired in October). With 25 years
of experience in law enforcement, Bruh is a seasoned federal cop who has
headed up criminal investigations at both the IRS and the Pentagon. Prior
to overseeing FinCEN, he was the chief investigator for the Tower Commission,
President Reagan's blue ribbon probe into the Iran-Contra scandal. FinCEN
was his crowning achievement, and he took pride in directing visitors to
FinCEN's computer command center as he touted the agency's successes.</P>

<P>In private and in testimony to Congress, statistics roll off Bruh's
tongue. Last year FinCEN's computer operations center responded to priority
requests for tactical intelligence on nearly 12,000 individuals and entities,
doubling the 1991 workload. The 1995 total will be three times the 1991
sum. Longer-term strategic analytical reports have been completed for 715
investigations involving 16,000 other individuals and entities.</P>

<P>Two of the government's biggest strikes against organized drug-money
laundering-operation Green Ice (a lengthy DEA operation that resulted in
the arrests of high-ranking Cali and Medellin cartel financial officers
and the seizure of US$54 million cash and assets) and Polar Cap V (a spinoff
of Green Ice that culminated in April 1990) - owe a great deal to FinCEN
for having identified and targeted money laundering activities via computer.
In the Polar Cap operation, FinCEN's computer tracking documented more
than US$500 million in financial activity by 47 individuals who have since
been indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.</P>

<P>Inside FinCEN's new digs on the second floor of a gleaming high-rise
office building down the road from the CIA in Vienna, Virginia (otherwise
known as &quot;Spook City&quot;), the talents of the IRS, FBI, DEA, Secret
Service, and other traditional federal cops such as customs agents and
postal inspectors are pooled. According to senior intelligence officers,
these investigative units can access the resources of the CIA, the National
Security Agency (which intercepts data on electronic currency movements
into and out of the United States, some of which make their way into FinCEN's
analyses), and the Defense Intelligence Agency.</P>

<P>Bruh and other FinCEN officials openly acknowledge their association
with the CIA, but they refuse to discuss further any aspect of FinCEN's
dealings with it or any other intelligence agency. In addition to the CIA,
intelligence officials have admitted, off the record, that the National
Security Council and the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research (INR) have also joined FinCEN's impressive intelligence crew.
In short, FinCEN is a one-of-a-kind cauldron containing all the available
financial intelligence in the United States.</P>

<P>&quot;It's the first ever government-wide, multi-source intelligence
and analytical network brought together under one roof to combat financial
crimes,&quot; said Peter Djinis, director of the Treasury department's
Office of Financial Enforcement and one of the few Treasury officials close
to FinCEN activities.</P>

<P>&quot;FinCEN is absolutely necessary,&quot; said a senior General Accounting
Office (GAO) official involved in an audit of FinCEN required by new anti-money-laundering
laws passed last year. The agency's report wasn't released by press time,
but according to the GAO official, no irregularities were uncovered. However,
the GAO's scrutiny skirted emerging concerns about privacy, civil rights,
and the appropriate role of the intelligence community.</P>

<P>FinCEN's mission requires the involvement of the intelligence community,
particularly in tracking the financial dealings of terrorists and in conducting
financial counterintelligence, although few are willing to discuss the
trend openly. Because these activities cross into the world of cloaks and
daggers, some watchdogs are concerned that such endeavors will encroach
on -privacy and civil rights. When you look at the power of FinCEN and
its proposed offspring, their fears seem justified.</P>

<P>HOW TO BUST A JOHN</P>

<P>The whiz kids at FinCEN are good. Very good. That's why state and local
police have come to depend on FinCEN to pull them out of the electronic-sleuthing
quicksand. The case of John the drug supplier is a good example of one
of their less-complex assignments, and it illustrates the adeptness with
which the government can collate existing financial data.</P>

<P>Seated at a computer terminal inside FinCEN's former command post, a
FinCEN analyst began the hunt. He started by querying a database of business
phone numbers. He scored a hit with the number of a local restaurant. Next
he entered the Currency and Banking Database (CBDB), an IRS database accessed
through the Currency and Banking Retrieval System. CBDB contains roughly
50 million Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), which document all financial
transactions of more than $10,000. By law these transactions must be filed
by banks, S&amp;Ls, credit unions, securities brokers, casinos, and other
individuals and businesses engaged in the exchange of large sums of money.</P>

<P>The analyst narrowed his quest by searching for CTRs filed for transactions
deemed &quot;suspicious.&quot; Financial institutions must still file a
CTR, or IRS Form 4789, if a transaction under US$10,000 is considered suspicious
under the terms of an extensive federal government list. There was a hit.
A series of &quot;suspicious&quot; CTRs existed in the restaurant's ZIP
code. Punching up images of the identified CTRs on his terminal, the FinCEN
analyst noted that the transactions were made by a person whose first name
was John. The CTRs were suspicious all right; they were submitted for a
series of transactions each in the amount of US$9,5000, just below the
CTR threshold of US$10,000. This was hard evidence that John structured
the deposits to avoid filing a Form 4789, and that is a federal crime.</P>

<P>Selecting one of the CTRs for &quot;an expanded review,&quot; the analyst
got John's full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address,
driver license number, and other vital statistics, including bank account
numbers.</P>

<P>Plunging back into the IRS database, the analyst broadened his search
for all CTRs filed on behalf of the suspect, including non-suspicious CTRs.
Only 20 reports deemed suspicious popped up on the screen, but more than
150 CTRs were filed in all. A review of the non-suspicious ones revealed
that on several, John listed his occupation as the owner or manager of
the restaurant identified by the telephone number on the slip of paper
taken from the arrested drug dealer. The connection between the name and
the phone number originally given to FinCEN was secured.</P>

<P>The FinCEN analyst then tapped commercial and government databases,
and turned up business information on the restaurant showing that John
had reported an expected annual revenue for his eatery of substantially
less than the money he had been depositing, as indicated by the CTRs. Fishing
in a database of local tax assessment records, the analyst discovered that
John owned other properties and businesses. With the names of these other
companies, the analyst went back into the CTR database and found that suspicious
transaction reports were filed on several of them as well.</P>

<P>As routine as such assignments as this case may be, the chumminess between
FinCEN and the intelligence community raises serious questions about the
privacy and security for the financial records of citizens John and Jane
Doe, considering the intelligence community's historic penchant for illegal
spying on non-criminals. Given the vast reach and ease with which the government
can now tap into an individual's or business's financial records on a whim,
these questions have received far too little scrutiny.</P>

<P>WHOSE PRIVACY? &quot;There are legitimate concerns&quot; regarding privacy,
a ranking House banking committee staffer conceded in an interview with
Wired. &quot;Quite frankly, there hasn't been much congressional oversight
with respect to the intelligence community's involvement with FinCEN. When
you start trying to look into this, you start running up against all kinds
of roadblocks.&quot; The GAO official involved in auditing FinCEN agreed
that questions regarding the intelligence community's involvement and attendant
privacy concerns haven't been addressed. If such issues have been the subject
of discussion behind the closed doors of the House and Senate intelligence
committees, no one is talking openly about it.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the potential for abusive intrusion by government into the
financial affairs of private citizens and businesses is growing almost
unnoticed and unchecked.</P>

<P>Two of the latest electronic inroads into the financial records of private
citizens and businesses are &quot;Operation Gateway,&quot; a FinCEN initiative,
and the proposed Deposit Tracking System, which other intelligence agencies
would like to see established. Both are inherently prone to abuse and provide
a disturbing indication of the direction in which the government is moving.</P>

<P>Gateway is a pilot program launched in Texas this July that gives state
and local law enforcement officials direct access to the massive federal
Financial Database (FDB) through a designated FinCEN coordinator. The FDB
contains the records that financial institutions have been filing under
the Bank Secrecy Act for the last 23 years - CTRs, suspicious transaction
reports, International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments
reports, and Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports. In addition.
Congress is expected to grant FinCEN authority to tap into the database
of Forms 8300, which are reports of payments over US$10k000 received in
a trade or business. These documents principally contain information on
deposits, withdrawals, and the movement of large sums of currency. It is
FinCEN's intent to give all state governments individual access to the
FDB.</P>

<P>Under the Gateway proposal, results from all queries would be written
into a master audit file that will constantly be compared against other
requests and databases to track whether the subject of the inquiry is of
interest to another agency or has popped up in a record somewhere else.</P>

<P>State coordinators designated by FinCEN will do the logging on, as FinCEN
is uncomfortable with giving 50,000 federal agents and 500,000 police officers
direct electronic access to its database. &quot;This is very sensitive
information,&quot; concedes Andy Flodin, special assistant to the FinCEN
director . &quot;We'd have to have additional security safeguards before
we could open it up to every police agency.&quot;</P>

<P>But while the FDB contains only records on major money movements and
thus is not as much of a threat to individual privacy, the Deposit Tracking
System (DTS) is a potential menace. If implemented, the estimated US$12.5
million computer system could be used to penetrate the security of bank
accounts belonging to you, me, and 388 million other bank account holders
in the US.</P>

<P>The government argues that such a system is necessary for two reasons;
first, to assess adequately the funding needed for federal deposit insurance
and second, to locate the assets of individuals ordered by courts to make
restitution for financial crimes - like the savings and loan crooks. (It
seems the government can't trace most of the money they stole.)</P>

<P>The first reason stems from a requirement of the seemingly innocuous
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991- one of Congress's
legislative response to the savings and loan debacle. The Act requires
the FDIC to study the costs, feasibility, and privacy implications of tracking
every bank deposit in the United States.</P>

<P>So far the DTS exists only on paper. The FDIC's completed feasibility
study is currently being examined by Congress, but it is unlikely to act
on before late next year. For the time being, the US$12.5 million price
tag seems to be the biggest drawback to its implementation.</P>

<P>Concerns about he DTS have been widespread, although it has received
scant attention in the mainstream press. But according to Diane Casey,
executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America, the
DTS &quot;would fundamentally change the relationships among banks, consumers,
and the government in ways that have implications beyond banking policy.
Out open and democratic society would be changed profoundly if any agency
of the government maintained the scope of information on private citizens
described in this proposal. It raises questions about our democracy that
would have to be addressed by the highest policy making levels of government.&quot;</P>

<P>The American Bankers association (ABA) voiced equally serious concerns.
The ABA doubts &quot;whether there are any privacy safeguards that would
be adequate to effectively protect this database from use by government
agencies and, eventually, private parties,&quot; an ABA spokesman explains.
&quot;It is inconceivable to the ABA that such a database could be used
only by the FDIC in deposit insurance coverage functions. Such a database...would
provide a wealth of information for investigations being conducted by the
FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the IRS, to name but a few.
Like the baseball diamond in Field of Dreams, build this database and they
will come. Eventually, whether legally or illegally, they will gain access
to this database.&quot;</P>

<P>The FDIC forcefully argued against the DTS in the 234-page draft report
it submitted to Congress in June 1993, but it may not have the bureaucratic
clout necessary to kill the proposal. Wired was told by intelligence analysts
and congressional sources dealing with oversight of the intelligence community
that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies are privately clamoring
for the system, apparently disregarding both the privacy issues and the
systems's start up cost (which does not include the additional US$20 million
a year the feasibility study said would be required for facilities, for
salaries and benefits, and for routine hardware and software maintenance).</P>

<P>Further driving the intelligence agencies's desire for the DTS is the
much-hyped role of economic intelligence gathering, a key focus of the
Clinton administration's reform of the intelligence community. Agencies
like the CIA view the system as a boon to their ability to monitor foreign
financial dealings in the US, according to both congressional and intelligence
courses.</P>

<P>Adding Intelligence to the Equation.</P>

<P>Regardless of the form it takes, the sources said, the DTS and any other
financial databases that come down the pike could be easily interfaced
to FinCEN's Artificial Intelligence/Massive Parallel Processing (AI/MPP)
program, a criminal targeting system that will go online in a few years.</P>

<P>Because laundered money is moved undetected along with the millions
of legitimate computerized wire transfers that occur daily, FinCEN's computer
investigations naturally demand expert systems that can single the dirty
money out of the crowd. FinCEN's current Artificial Intelligence capability
allows it to search the Financial Database for suspicious, preprogrammed
patterns of monetary transactions. While not very flexible, the system
identified previously unknown criminal organizations and activities.</P>

<P>But FinCEN has a hush-hush US$2.4 million contract with the US Department
of Energy's Los Alamo National Laboratory to develop what Bruh and other
FinCEN officials described as a powerful &quot;money flow model.&quot;
Unlike FinCEN's current system, Los Alamo's AI software will look for unexplained,
atypical money flows. Coupled with a massively parallel computer system,
the AI/MPP could perform real-time monitoring of the entire US electronic
banking landscape.</P>

<P>FinCEN's AI capabilities currently exploit the Financial Database for
proactive targeting of criminal activity. The system automatically monitors
the entire FDB database, constantly identifying suspicious financial activity
in supercomputer-aided, rapid-response time. In addition to the FDB, FinCEN
is applying AI to the Criminal Referral Forms that must be filed with FinCEN
whenever banks, examiners, and regulators uncover financial activities
they suspect are illegal.</P>

<P>In the near future, all of these government databases will be interfaced
by way of AI/MPP technology. &quot;MPP is critical to FinCEN's ability
to analyze (banking) data to its full capacity,&quot; Bruh insists.</P>

<P>The pure power of such a &quot;database of databases&quot; terrifies
critics. Though FinCEN and other authorities discount the potential for
abuse, tell that to the CIA. It charter forbids it from engaging in domestic
surveillance; nonetheless, it spied on Americans for seven consecutive
presidential administrations (it says it finally ceased its internal spying
in the mid-1970s).</P>

<P>FinCEN's AI operation has been employed legitimately with great success.
Perhaps its least-known project was assisting the CIA in identifying and
tracking the flow of money between Iran's state-sponsored Islamic fundamentalist
terrorist organizations and the men linked to the bombing of the World
Trade Center. According to a Treasury official and confirmed by Anna Fotias,
FinCEN's congressional liaison, FinCEN identified suspicious transaction
reports filed by a bank in New Jersey on wire transfers from Germany to
the accounts of two of the men charged with the bombing. With the bank
account in Germany identified, further AI processing-utilizing intelligence
from the CIA's DESIST computer system, the world's most extensive database
on terrorists-identified a company as a front for an Iranian terrorist
group. Coupled with DESIST's data on the two men's terrorist connections,
FinCEN was able to identify a number of previously unknown conduits of
terrorist funding in the US and abroad. Similarly, FinCEN was crucial in
identifying Iraqi assets in the US that were frozen in the wake of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, according to a Treasury official.</P>

<P>Still, given the CIA's less-than-spotless record, privacy advocates
are likely to find it disturbing that there are some within the walls of
CIA headquarters - apparently unbeknownst to anyone at FinCEN - who want
to merge DESIST with FinCEN's eventual AI/MPP ability and with all the
databases FinCEN routinely surveys. The justification for creating such
a system is compelling: More likely than not it would identify scores of
previously unknown financial conduits to terrorists.</P>

<P>Advocates of a full-time DESIST/FinCEN system carry their argument one
step further: Hooked into the yet to be authorized Deposit Tracking System,
the DESIST/FinCEN system would be able to identify terrorist financial
movements in real time, thus providing early warning of potentially imminent
terrorist actions. Some within the intelligence community take it still
another step: They would have the system tied into the private computers
that hold credit card transactions &quot;so that we could have nearly instant
time-tracking capability,&quot; with the CIA's Counterterrorist Center.</P>

<P>Conversely, a CIA/FinCEN/DTS endeavor could monitor on a real-time basis
the financial activity of narcotics traffickers, since drug dealing also
is within the purview of the CIA. The agency's Counternarcotics Center,
of CNC, already works closely with FinCEN.</P>

<P>Before the CIA would be allowed to tap into a system as sensitive as
the proposed Deposit Tracking System, it would have to clear plenty of
civil liberties hurdles, not the least of which is the prohibition on the
CIA from gathering intelligence on US citizens. As long as the DTS itself
was shielded from direct access by the CIA, proponents could argue that
the operation was allowable under law. Opponents, on the other hand, fear
that the CIA would find a way to download, copy, or otherwise secretly
access the DTS.</P>

<P>&quot;The risk of the CIA getting its hands on this is serious-we know
the kind of unscrupulous people who populate the spook world,&quot; said
a Washington-area private investigator who conducts many legitimate financial
investigations for a CIA-linked firm. &quot;This kind of financial data,
when coupled with other information like a person's credit history, could
be used for blackmail, bribery, and extortion,&quot; said the investigator,
who has a military intelligence background.</P>

<P>Bruce Hemmings is a veteran CIA clandestine-services officer who retired
in 1989. Prior to the DTS proposal, he told Wired that the CIA routinely
digs for financial dirt on people from whom the agency wants specific information.
Typically they are foreign intelligence officers working in the US under
a diplomatic guise, and this financial information is often used as leverage
in getting them to talk. In less civilized venues, this is called blackmail.</P>

<P>DTS could present an inviting mechanism for quieting unwanted dissent
or for defanging an unruly congressional leader bent on exposing some questionable
CIA operation. Although still in its embryonic stage and in spite of the
looming privacy obstacle it will inevitably confront, FinCEN is seen by
many in the government as the catalyst for a powerful, all-seeing, all-knowing,
global, financial-tracking organization. In fact, FinCEN is already working
closely with INTERPOL, and Bruh's deputy just resigned to head up INTERPOL's
US office.</P>

<P>As the privacy debate heats up, FinCEN's digital dirty-money trackers
go on about their work, hoping they don't have to choose sides if what
they do becomes a full-blown privacy invasion problem. As Bruh puts it,
&quot;There's tons of crooks out there who are disguising their criminal
profits. FinCEN needs to computerize as much as possible to be able to
identify the really significant criminals and their activities.&quot;</P>

<P>The question then becomes, at what point does it stop?</P>

<P>AMERICA'S NUCLEAR SECRETS</P>

<P>Article reprinted from Newsweek December 27, 1993 by The P/\NTHER/TRSI/UMF</P>

<P>Experiments on human guinea pigs, unannounced nuclear tests, a pulsating
wasteland of lethal atomic debris-the legacy of cold-war secrecy and superpower
competition is just how becoming clear.</P>

<P>Scenes from the Nuclear theater of a long cold war. In the 1940s and
'50s, when Americans still trusted their doctors and their government,
researchers subjected hundreds of ill-informed people to doses of nuclear
radiation, in order to study the effect on human beings. Later on, in two
experiments on the West Coast, 131 prison inmates, many of them black,
had their testicles irradiated. From 1963 on, the U.S. government conducted
hundreds of unannounced nuclear tests. The Russians weren't fooled, but
Americans were. Washington last secret underground detonation occurred
as recently as April 4, 1990.</P>

<P>By the 1990s, America was awash in nuclear waste. Tons of plutonium
from arms factories and spent fuel from nuclear reactors were stored haphazardly
and unsafely, sometimes threatening plant workers and nearby residents.
The public still has not been told the true dimensions of the toxic mess.</P>

<P>Bits and pieces of this disturbing story have been leaking out for years
in press articles, scientific studies and congressional hearings. But only
now is the extent of America's nuclear secrets coming into focus. It is
clear that the U.S. government behaved far more maliciously and recklessly
than most Americans ever suspected. The fact that Moscow's rival nuclear
program was probably dirtier still, and even less humane, offers scant
comfort.</P>

<P>Some things cannot be explained away, even by the imperatives of national
security. The most conspicuous agent of revelation so far is Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary. Two weeks ago she blew the whistle on her own department
and the rest of the government's nuclear establishment, by disclosing that,
over a span of 45 years, the United States had set off 204 unannounced
nuclear explosions and conducted radiation experiments on about 600 human
guinea pigs. The scientist who conducted those tests so long ago surely
had rational reasons: the struggle with the Soviet Union, the fear of imminent
nuclear war, the urgent need to unlock all the secrets of the atom, for
purposes both military and medical. But in the aftermath of the cold war,
and measured against today's more stringent ethical and procedural standards,
the science of the early nuclear age can seem almost barbaric. &quot;I
said, 'Who were these people [conducting experiments] and why did this
happen?&quot; O'Leary said in an interview with NEWSWEEK. &quot;The only
thing I could think of was Nazi Germany.&quot;</P>

<P>To date, O'Leary has told only part of the story, the tiny fraction
that has emerged from a 32 million-page mountain of secret documents waiting
to be declassified. Other parts have been dug up recently by local newspapers,
notably The Albuquerque Tribune in New Mexico, and Westword, a Denver weekly.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, weighed
in last week with the first conclusive evidence that the U.S. government
had conducted radioactive-warfare tests in the atmosphere. But information
is being pried out of the bureaucracy an inch at a time. O'Leary had to
fight with the Pentagon through 17 drafts of disclosure documents in order
to declassify the amount of plutonium contained in stockpiles throughout
the country (33.5 metric tons). She even had to battle her own staff to
release a report two weeks ago on the deteriorating storage facilities
for spent nuclear fuel.</P>

<P>Many facts have been uncovered by Congress as well including a subcommittee
chaired in 1986 by Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts. His report was
entitled &quot;American Nuclear Guinea Pigs.&quot; After studying 31 experiments
dating back to 1945, Markey wrote that U.S. citizens &quot;became nuclear
calibration devices for experiments run amok.&quot; He also charged: &quot;Too
many of these experiments used human subjects that were captive audiences
or populations ... considered 'expendable': the elderly, prisoners, hospital
patients, who might not have retained their full faculties for informed
consent.&quot;</P>

<P>Starting in 1963, 131 inmates at two prisons in Oregon and Washington
state were recruited for experiments paid for by the Atomic Energy Commission,
a predecessor of today's Department of Energy (DOE). Each volunteer was
paid about $200 and had to sign a consent form. &quot;I hereby agree to
submit to X-ray radiation of my scrotum and testes,&quot; said the form
used in Oregon. The inmates were warned about the possibility of sterility
and radiation burns, but the Oregon form said nothing about a risk of testicular
cancer. After the experiment the Oregon men were given vasectomies-&quot;to
avoid the possibility of contaminating the general population with irradiation-induced
mutants,&quot; wrote the late Dr. Carl Heller, who ran the tests. For that
reason, Roman Catholic inmates were not allowed to participate, Markey's
report noted.</P>

<P>The men were given varied doses of radiation as high as 600 roentgen
(today the largest recommended dose is six roentgen for an entire year.)
Those who received 15 roentgen or more became sterile temporarily. There
is no evidence that any of them developed cancer as a result of the experiment.
But none of the Washington prisoners has been tracked since the early 1970s:
the inmates themselves didn't want continued medical scrutiny. In Oregon,
where no follow-up tests were done either, some of the prisoners filed
suit in 1976 demanding medical treatment. Eventually the Oregon state Legislature
intervened, granting continued treatment to nine of the men and awarding
them with a cash payment. The nine men split a total of $2,215.</P>

<P>Hot shots: Last month The Albuquerque Tribune published a series naming
five of 18 hospital patients who were given &quot;tracer&quot; injections
of plutonium in a government sponsored study between 1945 and 1947. Many
of the patients were expected to die soon, but some cases didn't work out
that way. Elmer Allen, an impoverished 36-year-old railroad porter from
Texas, got a shot of plutonium in his injured leg. Three days later the
leg was amputated above the knee and taken away by researchers. Allen didn't
die for another 44 years, but long life was no blessing to him. His daughter,
Elmerine Whitfield said he had seizures and was severely depressed. He
drank too much. &quot;I believe my father was aware something had been
done to him.&quot; said Whitfield. But she insisted he never gave informed
consent to the experiment. &quot;I know he didn't understand plutonium,&quot;
she said.</P>

<P>Scientists who worked in the dawn of the nuclear age defend the validity
of the plutonium tests. &quot;We should be extremely cautious about criticizing
their work.&quot; says John Simpson, a retired astrophysicist who worked
on health and safety issues as a group leader on the Manhattan Project,
which developed the first atomic bomb. If research had not been done on
humans, he says, &quot;radioactive dangers would be greater throughout
the world today.&quot;</P>

<P>Biophysicist Newell Stanard, an authority on the history of radiological
research, says the plutonium tests were launched because several Manhattan
Project workers in Los ALAMO, N.M. had been exposed to the material. No
one knew for sure how much damage the plutonium would do to them or how
quickly and thoroughly it would be expelled from their bodies. &quot;There
had been a lot or work with animals that showed rates of fecal and urine
excretion of the plutonium, how much went to bone marrow and so on,&quot;
says Stannard. &quot;But there was this big question: will it be the same
in man? The Manhattan Project said we've got to do experiments in terminal
patients and see if the results are the same as in animals.&quot;</P>

<P>Stannard says that 11 of the 18 tests were done in Rochester, N.Y. by
a respected internist, Dr. Sam Bassett; the others were scattered around
the country. Were the patients fully informed? &quot;I simply don't know,&quot;
says Stannard. &quot;I do know that Sam Bassett was a very straightforward,
honest guy. I'm sure he told the patients he was going to do something.&quot;
But plutonium research was a top-secret subject in those days. &quot;I
have a feeling Bassett told people they were taking something for the war
effort,&quot; says Stannard.</P>

<P>Many other tests conducted on humans were benign and were performed
quite casually, without a lot of red tape. &quot;The level of acceptable
informed consent has changed,&quot; says Dr. Merril Eisenbud, professor
emeritus of environmental medicine at New York University Medical Center.
He describes some of his own research. &quot;Open-air [nuclear] weapons
testing left iodine in the milk worldwide,&quot; he says. &quot;One of
my experiments was to determine the significance in terms of the dose absorbed
by a child's thyroid. We used to get the children to come over from a pediatric
clinic with their moms. We'd explain what we were doing, sit each child
down and-using a scintillometer that didn't even touch him-measure radiation
in the thyroid. We'd give the child a lollipop, and that was the end of
that. Today you'd have to fill out so much paperwork that it would discourage
people from participating in the test.&quot;</P>

<P>In the 1940s and '50s, many doctors weren't in the habit of explaining
things to their patients. &quot;Doctors weren't questioned,&quot; says
Dr. Andrew Davis of Chicago, a frequent writer on radiation-health issues.
&quot;When you combine that with radiation technology, born of secrecy
in the name of military security, it becomes easier to understand-if not
condone-these experiments and accidents. Dr. Kildare could do no wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>Death Spray: In reality, of course, some researchers did numerous wrongs,
as they are now defined. According to the GAO report, radiation was deliberately
released into the atmosphere in at least a dozen secret tests in New Mexico,
Tennessee and Utah between 1948 and 1952. The tests were part of an effort
to develop a radiological weapon-or to defend against one, if the Soviets
developed a death spray. At about the same time, the Hanford Nuclear Facility
in Richland, Wash., was regularly showering its neighbors with radioactivity.
A secret internal memo uncovered in 1986 described the infamous Green Run
experiments, in which plant managers deliberately released a huge cloud
of radioactive iodine-131, to see how far downwind it could be traced.
The could floated over Spokane and drifted all the way to the California-Oregon
border, carrying hundreds (or perhaps thousands) of times more radiation
than that emitted by the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania.</P>

<P>Now that nuclear testing has ended, at least in the United States, the
government is left with a vast, pulsating landscape of atomic waste dumps
to clean up. The people who developed nuclear reactors and weapons were
no more prescient about future environmental hazards than they were about
health risks. The storage of spent fuel and other nuclear materials was
shockingly sloppy. &quot;Every time you turn over a new document, there's
a $5 billion problem,&quot; says Dan Reicher, a special assistant to O'Leary.</P>

<P>The DOE's nuclear-weapons complex, spread over 4,000 square miles in
13 states, appears to be particularly hazardous. Steven Blush, a DOE safety
official who was forced out of his job last spring, wrote a lurid report
charging that the bomb factories averaged three accidents a day in 1991
and '92. Most of the mishaps were minor, but a few of them posed potentially
major health threats to factory workers and nearby residents, Blush charged.</P>

<P>One of the most conspicuous problem plants is the DOE's weapons facility
at Rocky Flats, outside Denver. Starting in 1989, a federal grand jury
collected evidence about alleged violations of environmental law there.
Early last year the grand jury tried to indict DOE officials and executives
of Rockwell International, a former operator of the plant, accusing them
of participating in &quot;an ongoing criminal enterprise&quot; by ignoring
environmental laws.</P>

<P>The local U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, and instead announced
a plea bargain with Rockwell, which agreed to pay a fine of $18.5 million-slightly
less than the annual performance bonus it received for successful stewardship
of the plant. The grand jurors continued to press their case, and when
the story leaked to Westword, they found themselves under investigation
for violation of secrecy laws. Now the grand jurors are hoping to testify
before Congress. &quot;It's doubtful that you could find a bigger environmental
criminal than the Department of Energy,&quot; charges their lawyer, Jonathan
Turley, an expert on environmental law at George Washington University.
&quot;It hasn't changed with the new administration,&quot; he maintains.</P>

<P>Morning after: O'Leary would dispute that. The secretary bucked her
own bureaucracy by insisting that the DOE release a report on deteriorating
storage sites for spent nuclear fuel. Aides warned that disclosure could
cause liability problems. O'Leary insisted. &quot;I want this done,&quot;
she said. But there's a lot more to do. &quot;It's as though you had a
party every night for 45 years, and you never cleaned it up,&quot; says
Thomas Grumbly, DOE assistant secretary for environmental restoration and
waste management.</P>

<P>Grumbly is a worrier. He predicts that the figures currently quoted
for the total cost of the cleanup-from $200 billion to $300 billion-may
not even be close. &quot;It could be a couple of times larger than that,&quot;
he says. He frets about the notorious storage tanks at Hanford, where so
many different wastes have been dumped that no one knows exactly what kind
of witches' brew is in them. &quot;Every time the phone rings after 10
o'clock at night, I think 'This is it we've had an event',&quot; says Grumbly.
Like his boss, he things the time has come for &quot;throwing open the
blinds&quot; to shed some light on the nuclear-waste crisis. The government's
complete disregard of the byproducts of its cold-war born nuclear obsession
has left us with &quot;the single largest environmental and health risk
in the nation,&quot; he says. It may also be the last of America's nuclear
secrets-and perhaps the most dangerous of them all.</P>

<P>A HUMAN HORROR STORY Plutonium: What doctors didn't tell Eda Charlton</P>

<P>Eda Schultz Charlton was alone and sick when she visited the University
of Rochester's Strong Memorial Hospital in the fall of 1945. A protein
deficiency had swollen her ankles and covered her body in a serious rash.
Doctors also suspected a mild case of hepatitis. The 48 year old seamstress
was newly widowed-her husband had died suddenly a year earlier. Her only
son was in the service. Physicians put her on a high protein, low salt
diet.</P>

<P>They also made Charlton an unwitting subject in a grotesque government
sponsored medical experiment. On Nov. 27, 1945, according to records unearthed
by The Albuquerque Tribune, doctors at Stong working for the Manhattan
Project injected her with plutonium-239 to study how quickly the body rids
itself of the radioactive substance. (The hospital never sanctioned the
experiments.) Between 1945 and 1947, she and most of the 17 other patients
in the secret program-11 of them in Rochester-received dosages of about
.3 microcurie. That is about 43 times what is now regarded as the safe
lifetime limit. Charlton wouldn't learn of the official poisoning for another
30 years.</P>

<P>Family members say they suspected she was monitored during her routine
checkups over the years at Strong. The visits often turned into stays lasting
several days-even when it was clear she wasn't all that ill. &quot;They
used to keep her in a section that was like a hotel,&quot; says her son,
Fred Schultz. Once his mother said that doctors placed her in a sealed
room to check her body for radiation. Efforts to glean any information
were always rebuffed. In the early 1970s, the family quizzed one doctor
who'd treated Charlton since 1950. &quot;When I asked her about plutonium,
she'd say, 'I don't know a thing about it',&quot; recalled her daughter-in-law,
Helen Schultz.</P>

<P>Hospital officials say they informed Charlton and other living victims
of the experiment on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1974. The
Schultzes say they learned about it from a doctor at Strong five years
later. Doctors claim Charlton suffered no health problems from the radiation.
She died of a heart attack in 1983. But Fred Schultz, now 73, remains bitter.
&quot;I was over there fighting the Germans who were conducting these horrific
medical experiments,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time my own country
was conducting them on my mother.&quot;</P>

<P>SINS OF A PARANOID AGE</P>

<P>Cold War: Desperate times made for desperate-and dangerous-measures</P>

<P>In 1949, WHEN MOST AMERICANS wanted nothing more than to &quot;go to
the movies and drink Coke,&quot; as W. Averell Harriman once put it, the
Soviets exploded a Nuclear bomb. The onset of the cold war came as a cruel
surprise. The United States had just won World War II. Was World War III
around the corner? By 1951, when the CIA received an intelligence tip that
seemed to indicate that the Russians were about to corner the world market
in LSD, anxiety about communism had become paranoia. The CIA was particularly
obsessed with mind control. At show trials in the East bloc, innocents
with glazed eyes were confessing to impossible crimes, while American POWs
in the Korean War were reportedly being &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the
Chinese. Had the communists developed some of the new mind-bending drugs
that could be used as a mass weapon against the West?</P>

<P>The LSD scare, like many intelligence tips in that era, turned out to
be bogus. But that didn't stop the CIA from taking steps to develop its
own mind-control program, code-named MKUltra. The technique that most intrigued
the agency was LSD, a new psychoactive drug that could induce hallucinations.
Unfazed when one of the agency's own researchers jumped out a window after
experimenting with LSD in 1953, the CIA hired prostitutes in Greenwich
Village, N.Y., and San Francisco to slip LSD doses to unsuspecting johns.
CIA researchers dutifully recorded the results from behind two-way mirrors.
Dozens of unwitting lowlifes went on wild trips, but the agency never did
learn how to control anyone's mind. The experiment was finally abandoned
in 1963.</P>

<P>The nuclear experiments that are now coming to light are just come of
the examples of how far America went in the cause of combating global communism.
In another phase of operation MKUltra, the CIA-seeking the perfect assassin-
tried to create &quot;guided animals.&quot; In one experiment, the agency
wired up a cat (its tail was the antenna) that had a habit of wandering
off the job and was eventually run over by a taxi. For years the Pentagon
and the Atomic Energy Commission were conducting all manner of secret tests-from
releasing clouds of radiation into the atmosphere in a determined attempt
to build bigger and better bombs, to irradiating the testicles of prison
inmates in order to find our how much would cause sterility. As it turned
out, almost all the reports of Russian superiority in the cold war were
hyped. When the development of the U-2 spy plane allowed overflights in
the mid-to late 1950s, it was discovered that the &quot;bomber gap&quot;
and the &quot;missile gap&quot; were phony. The only gap was the other
way around: In 1961, the Pentagon had 98 missiles aimed at the Soviet Union,
the Kremlin no more than 35 aimed at the United States.</P>

<P>For all its cold-war glamour, the CIA was not a very effective espionage
agency in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Though it had reasonable success
overthrowing left-leaning governments in the Third World, the agency utterly
failed to penetrate the Kremlin (admittedly a difficult task against a
police state). Still, it did not serve top leaders to admit this to the
public.</P>

<P>In order to persuade lawmakers to pay for worthy causes like the Marshall
Plan, it was sometimes necessary to make things &quot;clearer than the
truth,&quot; said Dean Acheson, President Truman's secretary of state.
If that meant scaring people, so be it. Certainly, the people were ready
to be scared: families built fallout shelters, while children learned how
to duck under their desks.</P>

<P>Washington officials lied in part because they could get away with it.
The press was cozier with policymakers in the 1950s, and lawmakers didn't
really want to know what the CIA was up to, as long as the cause was battling
the Red Menace. Hungry for higher budgets, the Pentagon inflated the threat
it faced. And over time, even the most cynical politicians began to believe
their own rhetoric. In the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy
was still warning about the missile gap. When his defense secretary, Robert
McNamara, publicly admitted that none existed, Kennedy privately chastised
him for telling the truth. McNamara apologized-and promptly ordered a massive
buildup of America's nuclear arsenal.</P>

<P>The Randy Weaver Case...Another Federal Fiasco!</P>

<P>Reprinted from American Rifleman November 1993 by The P/\NTHER -TRZ-TRSI-UMF-</P>

<P>Seeing his dog, Striker, shot to death by masked intruders clad in camouflage,
Sammy Weaver, 14, fired back in fear for his life. The 4 ft, 11&quot;-tall
youngster was hit in the arm, then shot in the back as he turned to run
for home. He died instantly, killed by an agent of the federal government.
Cradling her 10 month old daughter in her arms, Vicki Weaver stood in the
doorway of her home, mourning her slain son, unaware that she herself had
only seconds to live. In an instant a bullet tore into Vicki Weaver's face,
blew through her jaw and severed her carotid artery. The bullet was fired
from 200 yds. away by an agent of the federal government.</P>

<P>What had the Weaver family done to bring FBI snipers and submachine-gun-toting
U.S. Marshals to the woods around their cabin on Ruby Ridge in northern
Idaho? Why did the government act as though the Weavers and forfeited the
protections guaranteed all Americans by the United States Constitution?
Who made the decisions that led to their unjustified deaths and also to
the death of deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan?</P>

<P>For the six men working near Weaver's plywood cabin on Ruby Ridge, Aug.
21 1992, was another day on a job that had been going on more than 16 months.
Their employer, the U.S. government, was spending $13,000 a week, and there
had been no end in sight to the work.</P>

<P>The cabin-really a shack-was home to 44-year-old former Green Beret
Randy Weaver and his family-wife, Vicki; son, Sammy; and daughters, Sara,
Rachel and Elisheba. It was also home to their young friend, Kevin Harris.
There were subsistence hunters, and tended a garden, putting up vegetables.
A generator produced occasional electricity. They had no TV, no radio.</P>

<P>This day there were some new men on the job site not far from the cabin-one,
42-year-old William Degan, had been brought to northern Idaho on special
orders. He was to help plan a successful conclusion to the job.</P>

<P>The men in the woods were dressed in their work clothes-camouflage commando
outfits complete with masks. They carried the tools of their trade-two-way
radios rigged for quiet operation, night vision equipment, semi-automatic
handguns, fully automatic military rifles and at least one silenced HK
submachine gun. One of the men was a medic, prepared to care for any casualties.</P>

<P>The Weaver family had dogs. Somebody threw a rock to test their reaction.
A golden retriever barked near the cabin and came running their way. A
mission somebody in the Marshal Service had dubbed &quot;Operation Northern
Exposure&quot; was about to end.</P>

<P>The &quot;op&quot; had included use of jet reconnaissance overflights
with aerial photographic analysis by the Defense Mapping Agency, and placement
of high-resolution video equipment recording activity by the Weaver family
from sites 1 1/2 miles away-160 hours worth of tape used.</P>

<P>For nearly a year and a half, federal agents had roamed the area, picking
locations for surveillance and for snipers. Degan belonged to the Special
Operations Group, the Marshals' national SWAT team. The six on-site this
day were deputy U.S. Marshals.</P>

<P>The target of all of this-and of a Federal law enforcement and prosecution
effort that would eventually total approximately $3 million-was Randy Weaver.
What kind of criminal was he to demand this kind of attention? Was he a
major drug dealer? Serial killer? Was he a terrorist bomber?</P>

<P>No. On Oct. 24, 1989, Weaver sold two shotguns whose barrels arguably
measured 1/4&quot; less than the 18&quot; length determined arbitrarily
by Congress to be legal. The H&amp;R single-barrels 12-ga. and Remington
pump were sold to a good friend who instructed Weaver to shorten the barrels.
The &quot;good friend&quot; was an undercover informant working for the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), who later told reporters
he was in it &quot;mainly for the excitement.&quot;</P>

<P>Eight months after he sold the shotguns, Weaver was approached by two
BATF agent with an offer-spy on the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist
hate group headquartered in northern Idaho, or go to jail. Weaver refused
to become a government informer, and-six moths later-he was indicted on
the shotgun charge.</P>

<P>On Jan. 17, 1991, as Weaver and his wife were driving to town for supplies,
they encountered a pickup truck camper with its hood up, a man and a woman
seeming to be in trouble. The Weavers stopped to offer their help. A horde
of federal agents piled out of the camper. A pistol was pressed against
Weaver's neck. Vicki Weaver was thrown to the slushy ground.</P>

<P>Weaver was arraigned before a federal magistrate, who later admitted
he cited the wrong law. Out on bond, Weaver went back to his cabin. According
to friends who testified in court, he and his wife vowed not to have any
more dealings with the courts of the federal government. They would just
stay on their mountain.</P>

<P>A hearing was set on the shotgun matter for Federal Court in Moscow,
Idaho. The government notified Weaver by letter that he was to appear March
20, 1991. The actual hearing was held February 20-one month earlier. The
error in dates was enough to give rise to a memo within the Marshal Service
saying the case would be a washout. (Weaver did not show for the wrong
date, either.) U.S. Attorney Ron Howen went to the grand jury anyway, and
Weaver was indicted for failure to appear.</P>

<P>But why had the BATF picked Randy Weaver to set up as an informer? He
was a man devoted to his family, a man with no criminal record, a veteran
who served his country with honor. It was Weaver's beliefs that made him
an ideal target. His unorthodox religious and political views were far
outside mainstream America. He was a white separatist. And, Randy Weaver
was little, a nobody.</P>

<P>Over the next 16 months, the feds painted Weaver as racist, as anti-semitic,
as a criminal. But they had to entrap him into his only crime, altering
two guns. The media were unquestioning. In print and on TV and radio, Weaver's
home-the plywood shack he built himself-became a &quot;mountain fortress,&quot;
and then &quot;a bunker,&quot; and &quot;a stronghold protected by a cache
of 15 weapons and ammunition capable of piercing armored personnel carriers.&quot;</P>

<P>The common shotguns Weaver sold became the chosen &quot;weapon of drug
dealers and terrorists&quot; of &quot;gangster weapons&quot; that &quot;have
no sporting use.&quot; The media always added the universal out...&quot;agents
said.&quot; But there were no gangsters. There were no terrorist or drug
dealers, just Weaver, the gun buyer and the government.</P>

<P>It was all a lie. Hate-hype. People believed it, maybe even the agents
who planted the hate-hype began to believe it. It all ceased to matter
on August 21, when Striker barked and sniffed out the agents spying on
the cabin-lives changed, lives ended.</P>

<P>Nobody, except the people who were there, knows exactly what happened
next. There were several versions of the story. But some facts jibe. Randy
Weaver's little boy, Sammy-a kid whose voice hadn't yet changed-and Kevin
Harris followed Striker. Harris and Weaver later said they thought the
dog was chasing a deer. Harris carried a bolt-action hunting rifle. The
boy also had a gun.</P>

<P>Without a warning a federal agent fired a burst into Striker, killing
him. (It came out in court later that there had been a plan to take the
dog &quot;out of the equation.&quot;) The boy, frightened, shot back, and
when one of the agents fired another burst, Sammy lay dead.</P>

<P>Kevin Harris shot deputy William Degan in the chest. He died a few moments
later. The shooting ended relatively quickly. The agents would claim Harris
fired first. Harris claimed he fired after the boy was shot. Agents told
the media their men had been pinned down for eight hours. It was lie.</P>

<P>The dog was dead. The boy was dead. Deputy Degan was dead. Two American
families had tragically lost loved-ones. During the night hours. Randy
Weaver and Kevin Harris brought the little boy's body to a shed near the
cabin and washed.</P>

<P>Deputy Degan's shooting brought in the FBI. Soon, the Weaver's property
was ringed by a huge force of FBI, BATF, U.S. Marshals, Idaho state police
and local law enforcement and Idaho National Guard. Among the federal law
enforcement commanders was Richard Rogers, the head of the FBI's hostage
rescue team, which includes its snipers. On the flight out, he took an
extraordinary step-he decided to alter radically the prescribed rules of
engagement of FBI sharpshooters.</P>

<P>Normally, agents can only shoot when they are facing death or grievous
harm. But the 11 snipers that were positioned around the Weaver cabin were
given new orders: &quot;If any adult in the compound is observed with a
weapon after the surrender announcement is made, deadly force can and should
be employed to neutralize the individual.&quot; This meant Randy Weaver's
wife would be fair game. It went on: &quot;If any adult male is observed
with a weapon prior to the announcement, deadly force can and should be
employed if the shot can be taken without endangering the children.&quot;
(Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>In words reminiscent of hollow justifications used in Waco, Texas, federal
spokesmen kept telling the media of their concern for the children. In
fact, Gene Glenn, the agent in charge of the siege, told The New York Times
he considered the kids to be hostages. Yet they'd already killed one child.</P>

<P>The negotiators were not in place, and no effort had been made to contact
the Weavers, when Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris-armed-and 16 year old Sara
Weaver left then cabin and moved to the shed where Sam's body lay.</P>

<P>As the three reached the shed, an FBI sniper some 200 yds. away aimed
at Weaver. He told the court he was aiming for the spine, just below the
neck. He missed; shot Weaver in the back of the arm, the bullet exiting
through the armpit.</P>

<P>Sara later told Spokesman Review staff writer Jess Walter in a copyrighted
story: &quot;I ran up to my dad and tried to shield him and pushed him
toward the house. If they were going to shoot someone, I was going to make
them shoot a kid.&quot;</P>

<P>At the cabin, Vicki Weaver was waiting at the door, holding her infant
daughter, Elisheba. The sniper fired again. His bullet hit Vicki Weaver.
She was dead before the baby hit the floor, miraculously unhurt. Harris
was hit by bullet fragments and bone from Vicki's skull. He was bleeding
badly. Randy Weaver, daughters Sara and 10 year old Rachel all saw the
violent death.</P>

<P>Later, sniper Lon Horiuchi stated in court that killing Vicki Weaver
had been a mistake; that he was aiming for Kevin Harris. Defense attorney
Spence asked him, &quot;You wanted to kill him didn't you?&quot; He answered,
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Sara Weaver recounted the night following her mother's death. Against
from reporter Jess Walter's story:</P>

<P>&quot;Elisheba cried during the night. She was saying, 'Mama, mama,mama.'...Dad
was crying and saying, 'I know baby. I know baby. Your Mama's gone..'&quot;</P>

<P>She told Walter that on Sunday, they tried to yell at federal agents
and get their attention, to tell them that her mother was dead. She said
they got no response. Instead they would hear FBI negotiators. &quot;They'd
come on real late at night and say, 'Come out and talk to us, Mrs. Weaver.
How's the baby, Mrs Weaver,' in a real smart-alecky voice. Or they'd say
'Good morning, Randall. How'd you sleep? We're having pancakes. What are
you having?'&quot;</P>

<P>The FBI later claimed it had no idea that its sniper had shot Vicki
Weaver. Yet, a New York Times stringer quoted FBI sources as saying they
were &quot;using a listening device that allowed them to hear conversations,
and even the baby's cries in the cabin.&quot; Another lie?</P>

<P>On Thursday, August 27, radio newsman Paul Harvey used his noon broadcast
to reach the Weavers, who he'd learned were regular listeners. Urging Randy
Weaver to surrender, Harvey said, prophetically, &quot;Randy, you'll have
a much better chance with a jury of understanding homefolks than you could
ever have with any kind of shoot-out with 200 frustrated lawmen.&quot;</P>

<P>As part of their efforts to make contact with the Weavers, the FBI sent
a robot with a telephone to the cabin. But the robot also had a shotgun
pointed at the door, so the Weavers feared that reaching for the phone
could result in death or injury.</P>

<P>Somewhere in all of this, the FBI discovered the body of Sammy. They
told the news media they didn't know he'd been killed.</P>

<P>The siege began to unravel six days after Vicki Weaver had been killed.
Her body remained in the kitchen of the cabin all that time. Sara crawled
around her to get food and water for her family. It was during this time
that Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris dictated their version of their story
to Sara. In this letter, Weaver accused his government of murdering his
wife.</P>

<P>The news media, based on information from the feds, repeatedly reported
that Vicki had been killed in &quot;an exchange of gunfire&quot; or in
a &quot;gun battle.&quot; More spin control.</P>

<P>The only shots were two-from the government's sniper.</P>

<P>Kevin Harris was the first person to come out. Sunday, August 30, badly
wounded, he was rushed to a Spokane hospital where he was treated and charged
with murder. A magistrate told him he was facing the death penalty.</P>

<P>The rest of the family came out on the next day. The surrender was negotiated
not by the FBI-but by Bo Gritz, former Green Beret hero.</P>

<P>All the lies and federal spin control over the story were about to end.
The case was going to court.</P>

<P>The 36 day trial took place in the U.S. District Court in Boise, with
Judge Edward Lodge presiding. The jury of eight women and four men heard
the government put on 56 witnesses. The defense rested without calling
a single witness, confident that the government had destroyed its own case.
They were right.</P>

<P>The jury deliberated for nearly three weeks, and found Harris not guilty
of murder or any other charges leveled against him. They found Weaver not
guilty of eight federal felony counts. The judge had earlier thrown out
two other counts.</P>

<P>Weaver was found guilty of two counts: failing to appear in court and
violating his bail conditions. He was declared not guilty of the gun charge-the
seed of all this misery.</P>

<P>It was a bizarre trial, full of contradictions, with government witnesses
countering each other's stories as to the events of August 21, and countering
the events leading up to Vicki Weaver's death the next day.</P>

<P>The question of who fired first-Harris or the Marshals-was key to the
jury deciding on the murder charge against Harris. In the end they believed
Kevin Harris acted in self-defense. Earlier, the death penalty had been
ruled out. The law the prosecution cited had been struck down by the U.S.
Supreme Court two decades before.</P>

<P>The government spent days going over the Weavers' religious views, trying
to establish they were racist and demonstrated a long-lived conspiracy
to violently confront the government. The jury didn't believe it.</P>

<P>Marshal Service witnesses told about a series of pre-seige scenarios
to root Weaver out of his cabin. But when pressed by the defense, they
said they never considered simply knocking on the door and arresting him.</P>

<P>During the trial, the government admitted that the FBI had tampered
with the evidence; that the crime scene photos given the defense were phony
reenactments. Physical evidence had been removed and replaced. The prosecutor
knew and had failed to tell the defense.</P>

<P>The prosecution also withheld documents that might have helped the defense.
When ordered by the judge to produce them immediately, the FBI sent the
material from Washington, D.C., via Fourth Class mail, which took two weeks
to cross the country. For prosecutorial misconduct, the judge ordered the
government to pay part of the defense attorneys' fees, an action almost
unheard of in a criminal case. Prosecutor Howen also was forced to apologize
in open court. At the end of the trial, he collapsed in the middle of a
statement, telling the judge, &quot;I can't go on.&quot;</P>

<P>Gerry Spence told the jury, &quot;This is a murder case, but the people
who committed the murder have not been charged. The people who committed
the murder are not here in court.&quot;</P>

<P>After the trial, Spence told the New York Times, &quot;A jury today
has said that you can't kill somebody just because you wear badges, then
cover up those homicides by prosecuting the innocent.&quot; &quot;What
are we going to do now about the deaths of Vicki Weaver, a mother who was
killed with a baby in her arms, and Sammy Weaver, a boy who was shot in
the back?&quot; &quot;Here you had federal agents come into a little county
in northern Idaho, suspend state law and then say they had the right to
eliminate anyone with a gun.&quot; &quot;The crime he committed was not
sawing off a shotgun. The crime he committed was refusing to go undercover
for the BATF.&quot;-Garry Spence</P>

<P>Spence has asked the Boundary County, Idaho, prosecutor to bring charges
against various federal agents. Should that happen, lingering questions
about the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happen, lingering
questions about the Weaver case finally may be answered. Should that happen
another jury undoubtedly will serve notice to those who have forgotten
that the United States government is supposed to serve its citizen, not
entrap them, not defame them, not falsify evidence against them and absolutely
not kill their children.</P>

<P>ENEMY ATTACK AND UFO POTENTIAL Few Residents of the United States, except
for those in Hawaii, have experienced an enemy attack on their hometown
in this century; some think they have. The Great Los Angeles Air Raid of
February 26, 1942, began at 2:25 A.M. when the U.S. Army announced the
approach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warning system went
into effect for the first time in World War II. &quot;Suddenly the night
was rent by sirens. Searchlights began to sweep the sky. Minutes later
gun crews at Army forts along the coast line began snapping on their lights...
The din continued for two hours. Finally the guns fell silent. The enemy,
evidently, had been routed. Los Angeles began to taste the exhilaration
of its first military victory.&quot;</P>

<P>WHAT IS WAR?</P>

<P>&quot;War is a man-mad disaster. Earthquakes and floods happen to mankind,
but man makes war himself.&quot; War is a struggle in which two or more
large groups of people try to destroy or conquer each other. There are
&quot;hot&quot; wars and there are &quot;cold&quot; wars. When overt acts
of aggression involving force are employed, it is a &quot;hot&quot; war,
and there was a time in history when such wars were actually declared,
but not in the past half-century. However, the United States in each decade
since World War II has found itself involved in at least limited military
actions. Since the 1940s there have been the Korean &quot;police&quot;
action in the 1950s, the Vietnam conflict in the 1960s and 1970s, the Panama
invasion, and many other incidents arising showing the possibility of the
U.S. becoming involved in another &quot;World&quot; war.</P>

<P>Guard Against Complacency</P>

<P>It is easy for those of us in North America to consider the possibility
of enemy attack as being quite remote. While it is true that this continent
has not been visited with the death and destruction accompanying past wars,
we have found in each generation that wars are all to common and could
indeed at some future date involve our country. Certainly many portions
of North America are within easy range of enemy nuclear submarines and
we could at the least expected time be suddenly involved in a conflict.</P>

<P>The Persian Gulf War served as an example of how quickly the United
States can find itself in military conflict. Hence, there is always a need
to guard against the complacency that has evolved as our country has enjoyed
relative insulation from previous wars.</P>

<P>THE UFO THREAT-A FACT</P>

<P>In this chapter we will now turn our attention to the very real threat
posed by Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), whether they exist or not.
The well-documented and highly publicized War of the Worlds radio drama
by Orson Welles shows how even a perceived existence to alien creatures
can cause very real disaster-like conditions and panic among a given populace.
In addition, if the apparent visits by alien beings and their space vehicles
should pose any type of threat, it will as always be the fire service that
is called upon to provide the first line of life-saving defense and disaster
mitigation.</P>

<P>On April 25, 1991, radio station KSHE in St. Louis, Missouri, was fined
$25,000 by the Federal Communications Commission for broadcasting a mock
warning of a nuclear attack during the Persian Gulf War. The seriousness
with which the FCC treated this case is indicative of the very real panic
that can be created from even illusionary or fictional phenomena. Certainly
if these unexplainable events become more prevalent, the possibility of
panic could be even greater: and again, the fire department will be the
agency called upon to handle the situation. (35) Hence, as we near the
year 2000 and move beyond, any comprehensive disaster plan should address
the potential for panic and other deleterious effects that might befall
a populated area when unexplainable phenomena occur. We will see, as we
continue our discussion in this chapter, that widespread blackouts, communication
disruptions, and other potentially disastrous conditions have been linked
directly to UFO sightings. Hence, fire service leaders who want to ensure
that their disaster planning is complete will not neglect an appendix to
outline those things that could be done in preparation for the occurrence
of such phenomena.</P>

<P>Throughout this book, many of the references to actual events are based
on the experiences of both of the authors. However, in this area of UFOs
and their potential, we are relying largely on the research and experiences
of Charles Bahme. Chuck has made a considerable study of this subject and
is acquiring many publications and VCR tapes to augment his library on
this and related phenomena. His interest in UFOs was greatly heightened
when Congress in 1969 adopted a law (14 CFR Ch. V Part 1211 - Extraterrestrial
Exposure) which gave the NASA Administrator the arbitrary discretion to
quarantine under armed guard any object, person, or other form of life
which has been extraterrestrially exposed. The very fact that our congressmen
believed there was a necessity for such drastic authority made Chuck wonder
if they had only our astronauts in mind when they adopted it. Could it
be applied to anyone who has had a UFO encounter? Whether it has or not
is not likely to be a topic for public dissemination.</P>

<P>UFO Discussion-Why Now?</P>

<P>The subject of UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) was not included in
previous editions of this book. The first edition was the Handbook of Disaster
Control which Chuck personally published in 1952 following his release
from active naval duty in the Korean War. Although his services in the
conflict as Security Coordinator for the Chief of Naval Operations involved
the creation of a worldwide disaster control organization for the protection
of the physical properties of the Navy, it must be admitted that the directives
approved for this new organization did not reflect any significant concern
for a flying saucer threat to its shore establishment. That was in the
1950s. Now that we are in the 1990s it is doubtful that the UFO potential
would be brushed off so lightly by our military security forces. This change
of attitude was evidenced as far back as December 24, 1959, when the Inspector
General of the Air Force issued the following Operations and Training Order:
&quot;Unidentified Flying Objects-sometimes treated lightly by the press
and referred to as 'Flying Saucers'-must be rapidly and accurately identified
as serious Air Force business...&quot; (36)</P>

<P>There is no uncertainty about the reality of the war between nations
on our planet and the disastrous effects of military actions. The 200 sorties
flown every hour against Iraq in the Persian Gulf provided ample evidence
of global war's destructive power. On the other hand, there are many persons
who may believe that a discussion of the theoretical harm that could be
caused by a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs would be &quot;far out!&quot;
But this is not so for the thousands of witnesses of unexplained aerial
phenomena. To them it is also serious business.</P>

<P>Chuck's interest in UFOs commenced during the early morning hours of
August 26, 1942, while he was roller skating from his house to the nearest
fire station a few blocks away: the wail of sirens had signaled his recall
to fire duty, and with the stringent blackout orders in effect, driving
was not wise: besides, it was much more exciting to be out in the open
where he could see the spectacular aerial &quot;fireworks&quot; that filled
the heavens all around him. Few residents of the U.S. had ever experienced
a real or imaginary invasion of UFOs like that which occurred in what has
become known as &quot;The Los Angeles Air Raid of 1942.&quot; The Army
announced the approach of hostile aircraft and the city's air raid warning
system went into effect for the first time in World War II. The defense
to this &quot;attack&quot; is described in dramatic terms in the opening
paragraph of this chapter.</P>

<P>But what enemy had been routed? No one ever knew. All the fire fighters
saw in the sky were the 15 or 20 moving &quot;things&quot; which seemed
to change course at great speed apparently unaffected by the flak from
bursting shells all around them. Rumors that one had been shot down were
never verified, nor was the explanation that these zig-zagging invaders
were weather balloons ever taken seriously. In any event, for Chuck, that
unforgettable episode aroused a continuing interest in UFOs, rivaling his
professional fields of law and fire protection. The fact that he subsequently
was a member of a group whose sighting of a flight of UFOs was authenticated
by airport radar helped to sustain that interest.</P>

<P>UFO Background Information</P>

<P>With no intention of trying to prove or disprove the authenticity of
the numerous UFO encounters often related by very credible witnesses including
airline and military pilots, astronauts, police officers, fire fighters,
members of Congress, and even a U.S. President, the balance of this chapter
will present a brief history and nature of UFOs and their alleged occupants:
their propulsion origin, and possible motives for continuing reconnaissance.</P>

<P>A quick look at some of the classic accounts of encounters documented
in numerous foreign and U.S. publications might help us judge the magnitude
of their threat, if any, to social stability, and, if deemed desirable,
propose a fire service plan for coping with some of the conceivable catastrophic
effects that UFOs could produce on cities and densely populated areas.</P>

<P>For readers who already have made up their minds that there is no such
thing as a UFO notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence to the contrary,
it should be pointed out that there is circumstantial evidence that disastrous
effects have already been attributed to UFO activity in more than one nation,
including the United States.</P>

<P>UFOs-What Are They?</P>

<P>William Shakespeare put a fitting observation in the mouth of Hamlet,
the Prince of Denmark, that went like this: &quot;There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.&quot;
Whether Hamlet was referring to those strange lights or objects that appear
in the sky or near the ground and have no known cause, we will never know,
but the World Book Encyclopedia defines such things as UFOs. (37)</P>

<P>Several theories have been propounded as to what they might be. Some
scientists believe that they are of extraterrestrial origin-coming from
other planets. Military officers conjecture that they might be alien aircraft.
Some attribute them all to natural causes, such as meteors, comets, sun
dogs, light reflections, marsh gas, ball lighting, even though they must
admit that scientists cannot explain all UFO reports in that manner. Still
others are inclined to believe that they may be forms from other dimensions
which can materialize and dematerialize at will perhaps by making a wavelength
or frequency transition so as to become invisible to humans. Some believe
they are time travelers from the future.</P>

<P>UFO Classification System</P>

<P>Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Northern University Professor Emeritus of Astronomy
and an advisor to the Air Force's Blue Book Project, adopted a very simple
classification system based solely upon the manner of observation:</P>

<P>1. Nocturnal lights 2. Daylight disks 3. Close encounters (day or night)
4. Radar readings.</P>

<P>He concluded that this system tells us nothing about the nature of the
UFOs, but can suggest a means for gathering data.(38) He found that while
a large number of such reports were readily identifiable by trained investigators
as misconceptions of known objects or events, a small residue (about 1,000)
were not. These came from credible witnesses from such widely separated
places as Canada, Australia, South America, and Antarctica. He concludes
with: &quot;Although I know of no hypothesis that adequately covers the
mountainous evidence, this should not and must not deter us from following
the advice of Schroedinger: to be curious, capable of being astonished,
and eager to find out.&quot; (39) Dr. Hynek has an excellence, well-illustrated
article on UFOs in a 1982 book which gives a detailed history of the UFO
sightings, together with the reports of some well-known people who made
them, including President Jimmy Carter while governor of Georgia. (40)</P>

<P>Shapes of UFOs</P>

<P>Witnesses have described the shapes of UFOs as anything varying from
a sphere to a boomerang. Some have resembled flying saucers with a lid:
others a glowing tube: some as semi-spherical with colored apertures: some
with reddish-orange glows, or fire-like or sparking discharges. Incredible
speed and maneuverabilities not attainable by aircraft of any kind are
commonly observed. Many of the books and articles in Appendix H have excellent
photographs of these unexplained visitors-photos that have been checked
by experts for their authenticity.</P>

<P>History of UFOs</P>

<P>For hundreds of years mysterious objects in the sky and strange moving
lights have been reported by many people, including the military pilots
in World War II who called them foo fighters. (&quot;Where there's Foo,
there's Fire&quot;). In the middle of the 1900s flying saucers were increasingly
observed in the United States and other countries. Scientists at the University
of Colorado hired by the Air Force from 1966 to 1968 to study this type
of aerial phenomena could explain most of the UFO reports as a star (Venus),
meteor, planet, balloon, rocket, artificial satellite, etc. Sometimes atmospheric
conditions, aircraft exhaust trails, or unusual lighting conditions may
produce optical illusions that observers thought were UFOs. After investigating
more than 12,000 reports, the U.S. Air Force was unable to explain where
the unexplained UFOs come from, but apparently concluded that the national
security was not threatened by them. (41) The emphasis of the university's
team headed by Edward U. Condon, seemed to be more concerned with the establishment
of the emotional stability or instability of those who reported the sightings
than with other evidence.</P>

<P>Psychiatrists have examined the witnesses who claimed to have encountered
UFOs and even been taken aboard their craft, such as the two shipyard workers
in Mississippi, and found that they are not unbalanced people. (42) &quot;They're
not crackpots. There was definitely something here that was not terrestrial.&quot;
(43)</P>

<P>Dr. J. Allen Hynek agreed, and added, &quot;Where they are coming from
and why they are here is a matter of conjecture, but the fact that they
were here on this planet is beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; (44)</P>

<P>The Air Force, after 20 years of being deluged with UFO sightings and
spending millions of dollars on their investigation, decided to drop the
inquiry business and turned the project over to a Kensington, Maryland,
group called NICAP (National Investigation Committee on Aerial Administration)
with part of the task of trying to run UFO sighting reports, including
many by its own Apollo and Skylab astronauts. By 1974 over a score of astronauts
saw and photographed UFOs during their flights beyond the earth's atmosphere.</P>

<P>Early in the Apollo II mission, which culminated in the moon walk, astronauts
Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins reported sightings of
what seemed to be a UFO during the first half of their flight to the lunar
surface. There were many more sightings by U.S. and Soviet Astronauts.
On November 11, 1966, Gemini XII Astronauts Jim Lovell and Edwin Aldrin
said that they saw four UFOs linked together, and on October 12, 1964,
three Russian astronauts aboard Voskod reported that they were surrounded
by a &quot;formation of fast-moving disc-shaped objects.&quot; (45)</P>

<P>UFO Organizations</P>

<P>In addition to NICAP, some of the other organizations that study UFO
phenomena are MUFON (Mutual UFO Networks), CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy),
GSW (Ground Saucer Watch), CUFOS (the Center for UFO Studies), and APRO
(Aerial Phenomena Research Organization), an Arizona nonprofit scientific
and educational organization, founded in 1952. (46)</P>

<P>Why the Secrecy?</P>

<P>In their book UFOs Over America, authors Jim and Carol Lorenzo charge
that the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) has been closely involved in
the collection and suppression of UFO information. &quot;Witnesses to the
phenomena have been bribed, coerced, and threatened by the CIA, who wanted
valuable evidence given to them alone.&quot; (47) One reason given is that
military intelligence may view the UFOs as a tool of either a known or
unknown potential enemy. &quot;If these vehicles prove evasive and surreptitious,
all the more reason to suspect them...the probability looms large that
the minds behind these vehicles may well be gathering intelligence of their
own.&quot; (48)</P>

<P>Another reason for secrecy may lie in the hope of obtaining knowledge
relating to advanced propulsion methods and anti-gravity systems before
other potential enemies on earth may acquire it. Hence, though many nations
are secretly investigating UFOs, they are reluctant to share their findings.
Robert Lofton, in his book Identified Flying Saucers, claims that the Air
Force became the &quot;goat&quot; in the effort of the CIA to debunk many
sightings by pilots, radar technicians, and reliable civilian observers.
He thinks that the suppression of information about how dangerous UFOs
can be is wrong. After citing a case where a child was burned over 50 to
60 percent of her body by a low flying UFO and then taken to an Air Force
hospital, no one would explain why her clothes were not burned at the same
time. He also describes another burn case in New Mexico and another man
who recently received a sledge-hammer like blow that knocked him unconscious
by the force field of a 100-foot diameter UFO. &quot;The public ought to
be told the danger! . . . Nothing helps rumors and panic more than ignorance.&quot;
(49)</P>

<P>Major Donald Kehoe describes in his book Aliens from Space, The Real
Story of Unidentified Flying Objects the difficulties he had in 1957 in
trying to get the truth from government agencies after he was director
of NICAP, the world's largest UFO research organization with over 30 subcommittees
in the U.S. and abroad. (50)</P>

<P>According to some UFOlogists the attempts at cover-up by the CIA extend
to destruction of evidence that it could not confiscate. Apparently some
of our nation's important leaders have been denied access to some UFO secrets
in the possession of an agency of the United States, the very existence
of which is classified above top secret. (51) Senator Barry Goldwater,
a retired Air Force Reserve Brigadier General and pilot with many decades
of flying experience, was quoted as saying &quot;I certainly believe in
aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings
that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities.&quot; He said he
was refused permission to check the Air Force files on UFOs and added.
&quot;I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going
on that we don't know about-and probably never will unless the Air Force
discloses them.&quot; (52) He said that he put faith in the reports of
the Air Force, Navy, and commercial pilots who reported instances where
a UFO would fly near them- right off their plane's wing-and then just zoom
away at incredible speeds. &quot;I remember the case in Georgia in the
1950s of a National Guard plane going after a UFO and never returning.
And I recall the case in Franklin, Kentucky, when four military planes
investigated a UFO. One of them exploded in midair and no one knows why.&quot;
(53)</P>

<P>Unleashed by the policy of Glasnost (greater openness) the Soviet media
felt free to include accounts of UFO sightings. A Tass report of October
10, 1989, reported a large shiny ball or disk hovering over a Voronezh
park; residents saw the UFO land and three creatures similar to human beings
emerged, accompanied by a robot. (54)</P>

<P>Apparently the Russians felt no need to suppress this report which was
poked fun at in Newsweek and Time magazines (55) but not in U.S. News and
World Report: &quot;A scant few decades ago, both the U.S. government and
the media treated flying objects as no laughing matter-which even Congress
looked into. In 1966 Representative Ford responded to a rash of sightings
in his home state of Michigan by calling for, and getting, a House hearing
on UFOs.&quot; (56)</P>

<P>UFO Missions</P>

<P>Many reasons have been advanced for the purpose of the UFOs visits to
our planet. Although some of the persons who apparently have been the subjects
of genetic investigation, such as the family of Whitley Streiber may not
agree, the majority of those who have studied possible UFO visitors feel
that they are friendly. Mr. Streiber described his experience as terrifying,
and believes that these &quot;little figures with eyes that seem to stare
into the deepest core of being are asking for something. Whatever it is,
it is more than simple information. The goal does not seem to be a sort
of clear and open exchange that we might expect; whatever may be surfacing,
it wants far more than that. It seems to me that it seeks the very depth
of soul; it seeks communion.&quot; (57)</P>

<P>From the thousands of reports he has studied, William Spaulding, aerospace
engineer and head of the Arizona-based Ground Saucer Watch, believes that
a pattern indicates that UFOs are here on a surveillance mission; the fact
that a majority of sightings occur around our military installations, research
and development areas leads to the conclusion that a methodical study is
being made of the earth and its defensive and offensive capabilities. &quot;The
phenomena is not unlike our own space explorations:scout ship survey: soil
samples: landing.&quot; (58)</P>

<P>In his book Incident at Exeter. John Fuller discusses the seemingly
affinity of UFOs for electrical power lines in the northeastern part of
the United States. In a later section of this chapter dealing with the
effects of UFOs on our terrestrial activities, we will see how this affinity
may have been responsible for causing 36 million people to lose power over
an area of 8,000 square miles. (59)</P>

<P>Because of our recent adventures into space, there are some who speculate
that UFOs are more concerned with what we will do there, than in settling
here. In any event, the Air Force's official publication (issued by the
Government Printing Office 1968) called Flying Objects says that &quot;No
UFO has been determined to represent a threat to our national security.&quot;
That conclusion, however should not rule out less disastrous consequences
than the overthrow of our government.</P>

<P>ADVERSE POTENTIAL OF UFOS</P>

<P>Regardless of its past evaluations, the Air Force could be wrong about
a number of things. &quot;It can't even guess within a couple of billion
dollars what one of its planes is going to cost: maybe, despite skepticism
of the scientists and other investigators, the UFOs sent from other planets
do exist and have visited earth.&quot; (60) And maybe they have exhibited
some destructive effects, whether or not intentionally in ever instance,
which we need to consider when drafting a plan for coping with an emergency
situation where UFOs are involved. Some of these documented effects are
as follows.</P>

<P>UFO Hazards</P>

<P>The two principal hazards noted with relation to UFOs have been attributed
to powerful electrical fields which they can project in a general populace
or individual contacts.</P>

<P>Force Field Impact</P>

<P>The disruption of air and ground travel has often been reported in the
presence of UFOs. The ignition systems of auto and aircraft engines have
apparently been affected by energized force fields to such an extent as
to stop their operation: the headlights and radios have also ceased to
function. Here are a couple of examples. In Buenos Aires, on March 29,
1978, &quot;A strange force shut off their engine and headlights of their
Citroen CG, lifted it 15 feet off the road, then set it down a minute later
and 75 miles to the north.&quot; The driver had noticed a yellow and violet
light shining in his rear view mirror while driving the last leg of a long
stock car race, and he realized that it was approaching too fast to be
a competitor. A month later a Colombian bank manager and a navy officer
had their car headlights go off when buzzed by a UFO, with the navy man
suffering temporary paralysis. Other South American countries in which
similar actions were reported around that time included Argentina, Chile,
Peru, and Uruguay. (61)</P>

<P>These effects have also been noted to influence the controls and instruments
of aircraft, e.g., the pilot of a Piper PH-24 reported that his controls
became inoperable when he was approached by three disk-shaped objects,
10 to 12 feet in diameter, over Mexico City on May 3, 1975. (62) Similar
cases have been reported by military pilots, illustrated by the classic
case of the near mid-air collision of an army helicopter with a UFO on
October 18, 1973, over Ohio, where not only did both the UHF and VHF radio
wavelengths go dead temporarily, but the downward movement of the helicopter
with its four occupants was levitated upward by a green beam from the UFO
in time to prevent its crash into the ground. (63)</P>

<P>Communications Disruption</P>

<P>In addition to the impedance of radio transmissions and reception, such
as that described in the preceding incident, telephone interference has
occurred, illustrated by the chagrin of President Lyndon Johnson in having
his conversation from the Texas White House cut off while talking to assistants
in Washington, D.C. (64) The ability to render inoperable all electronic
forms of communications, including those that control the launching of
defense weapons systems, has been considered within the range of UFO capability.
Whether this could extend to the erasing of recorded computer data such
as bank records, personnel data, FBI, CIA, and NSA files, along with critical
information of every kind, is not beyond the realm of possibility.</P>

<P>Regional Power Blackouts</P>

<P>It has long been suspected that UFOs have the capability of blacking
out a city, state, or many states by exerting a force field sufficient
to overload the circuits of public and private utility installations. &quot;Few
things are more disturbing than to be plunged into pitch darkness without
warning: it is dangerous for masses of people. It paralyzes cities, blocks
highways, stops trains, leaves elevators suspended between floors. In general
it simply plays hell with the modern way of life.&quot; (65) You would
think that the power companies would have achieved sufficient reliability
in their high tech systems that a mass failure such as that which blacked
out New York and New England in 1965 would never happen-but it did. Although,
as we have mentioned before, it was known that UFO activity was associated
with disturbances with compasses, instruments, ignition systems, radios,
etc., it was inconceivable that it could also interfere with generation
and disturbance of electrical power. Such a connection was also inferred
in November 1953, when a glowing red object went over a residential area
of New Haven, Connecticut, causing lights to dim out on both sides of the
object's path and them come on when it went out of sight.</P>

<P>Power failures were also reported in association with UFOs in Brazil
in 1957 to 1959, Rome, Italy, in 1958: and Mexico in 1965. Likewise, in
Uberlandia, where the power station operators promptly closed the circuits
when the UFO apparently caused them to open, it did no good, and they were
unable to restore the power until the UFO departed.</P>

<P>&quot;The Granddaddy of all blackouts to date was the stygian blanket
that fell over 30 million people in the northeastern corner of the U.S.
during the early evening rush hour period on November 9, 1965.&quot; (66)
Relay services that were supposed to automatically transfer the load in
case of failure in one area to an alternate source malfunctioned. Military
communications relying on public power without alternate backup systems
also failed, but communications were operable to make a quick public announcement
that there was no military emergency. Though it was largely over by the
next morning, the official explanation about a malfunctioning small device
in a Canadian hydroelectric generating plant never accounted for the failure
of millions of dollars worth of electronic devices to shift the load when
the breakdown occurred.</P>

<P>Fireballs Over Syracuse-The Blackout Connection</P>

<P>Airplane pilots reported that UFOs were being chased across Pennsylvania
about 4:30 P.M., and electronics and construction engineers about 5:30
P.M., just prior to the Great Blackout. A veteran flight instructor who
had been flying over Syracuse on a training flight say a glowing globe
over the power lines leading the Niagara Falls generating plant. Hundreds
of others saw the glowing object in the sky on the night of the big power
failure.</P>

<P>That was on November 9th. On December 2nd, about 700,000 persons in
Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico also had their power fail. It was said to
have originated in a regular failure in El Paso: then on December 5th,
three nights later, 40,000 homes plus military installations in the area
of East Texas were also blacked out-overloaded! Missile grounds (White
Sands), Fort Bliss, Holloman Air Force Base, and numerous airports were
all blacked out (with no emergency power backup), and this was when President
Johnson's telephone call to the White House in Washington D.C. was cut
off. In response to his request for an explanation, President Johnson was
told that his calls were fed into a cable system that went dead when the
surge of power caused by the El Paso regulator blow-up hit it, and the
backup batteries didn't work. Though it may be debatable whether the above
cases of electrical transmission failure were merely coincidences with
UFO activity, an incident on April 18, 1962, involving a UFO that had been
tracked from New York, through Kansas to Eureka, Utah, was well documented.
The Air Force spokesman admitted that the object had landed, and during
the 42 minutes that it was on the ground near the power station there was
no power, but it was restored when the UFO left. The object was pursued
by jet interceptors summoned from Phoenix and Stead Field in Reno until
it exploded over the Mesquite Range in Nevada in a brilliant glare that
was visible over five states. (67)</P>

<P>UFOs-The Panic Hazard</P>

<P>The second major disastrous effect that UFO activity, real or imagined,
can have on the populace, is the creation of fear, panic, flight, and all
kinds of irrational behavior. We have mentioned already the rather well-documented
case of hysterical contagion and mass hysteria created by War of the Worlds,
the radio drama by Orson Welles about an invasion of Martians. It was broadcast
on Halloween of 1938 during the period of the invasions of Germany into
Austria and Japan into China. &quot;The drama, realistically presented
in the form of news bulletins and interviews concerning an alien spaceship
landing in New Jersey, resulted in many kinds of hysterical actions, including
thousands of panic-stricken phone calls, wildly fleeing automobiles, and
impromptu shot gun brigades.&quot; (68)</P>

<P>Though most persons reporting UFOs do not interpret them as personal
threats, it is possible that some of the large volume of reports may be
attributable to hysterical contagion. In any case, one of the reasons often
cited for the tight secrecy on government UFO research findings is the
need to prevent the possible panic that a revelation of the truth might
arouse. Rumors that people were being abducted, dematerialized, burned,
made radioactive, rounded up and impounded, liquidated with ray guns and
lasers or shipped off to Mars or Venus might well give rise to fear-fear
of the unknown. Hysteria could cause frightened persons to imagine that
their water was poisoned, the air contaminated with undetectable but lethal
aerosols or nerve gases. With hundreds of UFO squadrons zooming across
the landscape from California to New York, Toronto to Mexico City, communications
disrupted, widespread power failures, airports and railroads paralyzed,
highways turned into giant parking lots of immobilized vehicles full of
terrified motorists, the problem of restoring order and sanity would be
a tremendous challenge to all of the emergency services, assuming their
personnel would remain calm, detached, and able to resist the human impulse
to put the safety and well being of their own families ahead of the public's.
To make matters worse, some of the more excitable gun owners might be tempted
to rush out Rambo fashion, and in utter disregard of the damage that falling
bullets might cause innocent residents below their fallout, start firing
at the evasive objects regardless of the range.</P>

<P>Personal Hazards-Physiological</P>

<P>The force field affects on the physical environment communication, transportation,
illumination, and computerized data storage-have already been considered.
We might have added that some physical effects have been observed at locations
where UFOs have landed-circular patterns of crops destroyed by heat or
radiation and baking or sterilization of the soil at the site.</P>

<P>On a more practical basis there may be grounds for concern that more
than just the environment can be adversely affected by UFO actions. While
pursuing UFOs, military aircraft have disappeared in mid-air, exploded,
and suffered harassment. Persons on the ground have sustained serious burns,
paralysis, and &quot;blows&quot; from a force field, radiated emissions,
or rays and beams that have been described like that of a &quot;stun-gun&quot;
(69)</P>

<P>In 1980, three witnesses saw a red ball of light hovering above houses
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when suddenly a bolt of blue light shot down
and two houses burst into flames. (70) An Indiana man saw a bright light
flash pass his window: the power went off in his house so he went outside
to investigate and found a brilliantly lit object hovering above him: when
he started to walk toward it his body commenced to tingle and he was unable
to move until the object disappeared. A similar tingling sensation swept
over another man in Lynn, Massachusetts, one night when he approached a
domed object with a red glowing cone rising from a parking lot. He too
was immobile until the object moved out of sight. Some believe that even
animals may be at risk by UFOs: in trying to account for the death of 15
ponies, the leader of an investigative team believed they were crushed
by the anti-gravity field of a flying saucer as it took off.(71)</P>

<P>Thus, UFOs may not only have the power to control some of our military
and industrial establishment's highly technical scientific hardware, they
may also possess the ability to impose pain and control over people who
attempt to attack them, even to the extent of &quot;liquidating&quot; them
in one way or another.</P>

<P>UFOS-EMERGENCY ACTION</P>

<P>In view of the fact that many UFOlogists believe that we are fast approaching
a time when overt landings of UFOs will become less remarkable, and in
the absence of our knowing whether their visits are friendly or hostile,
it would not be remiss to give some thought to the part that fire departments
might play in the event of the unexpected arrival of UFOs in their communities.
For example, what would be your course of action as an incident commander
at the scene of a school ground where a UFO has crashed into the boiler
room, rupturing a fuel line, and ignition has occurred in the spilling
oil, endangering the occupants of the craft who are trapped in the wreckage?
If your rescue attempts are successful, and two of the five small alien
creatures are injured but still alive, how do you dispose of the dead and
treat the survivors? How would the presence of children on the school grounds
affect your actions? What persons and agencies would be notified?</P>

<P>The authors have never read any advice on these matters. The following
admonition was printed on the inside from jacket of Frank Edward's book
on flying saucers:</P>

<P>WARNING</P>

<P>&quot;Near approaches of UFOs can be harmful to human beings. Do not
stand under a UFO that is hovering at low altitude. Do not touch or attempt
to touch a UFO that has landed. In either case the safe thing to do is
to get away from there very quickly and let the military take over. There
is a possibility of radiation danger and there are known cases where persons
have been burned by rays emanating from UFOs. Don't take chances with UFOs!&quot;</P>

<P>In view of the federal law (cited earlier) empowering NASA's administrator
to impound, without a hearing, anyone who touches a UFO or its occupants,
it would be inadvisable to make personal contact unless you are willing
to submit to NASA's quarantine requirements, should the law be invoked.</P>

<P>Besides the possible physical effects of approaching a UFO, e.g., burns,
radiation, etc., there may be psychological effects produced by force fields
that could induce a hypnotic states in the viewer, loss of consciousness,
memory relapse, and submission to the occupants. Jacques Valle, author
of The Invisible College cautions that we should consider psychic effects,
such as space-time distortions experienced by percipients of craft-like
devices which appear to fade away-dematerialize-and then reappear: of alien,
strange voices or thoughts that may effect involuntary changes in the manner
in which witnesses may react in such circumstances. (72)</P>

<P>Perhaps the above warning of Edwards and Vallee are a little too cautious
and apprehensive to adopt as a general pattern of conduct in every situation.
In the absence of overt acts indicating hostility, there may be no danger
in approaching a landing (or landed) UFO with a positive, solicitous attitude
of wanting to be of service. This nonaggressive mental state may be telepathically
sensed by those aboard or emerging from the craft: a form of non vocal
communication is a possibility. It goes without saying that any display
of firearms or other weapons on your part could be construed as unfriendly
and likely to thwart your intention of conveying a helpful attitude.</P>

<P>In a best case scenario, you may be able to obtain guidance as to the
appropriate actions to take, whether of a life-saving nature, e.g., in
quelling a fire, abating a spill, and of preservation of property, or even
in the reduction of apprehension on the part of your response team and
the spectators.</P>

<P>In a less optimistic scenario, you may have engine trouble upon approaching
the scene, and radio contact could be lost with your dispatcher. If at
night, your headlights could go out, the city could be blacked out, and
your portable generators may malfunction when you attempt to use them for
fans and portable lights. It would certainly be an inopportune time for
your comrades to announce that they had decided to take their pensions,
effective immediately.</P>

<P>In any event, the incident could provide invaluable experience for further
training in coping with rare and difficult emergencies. Whatever &quot;inside&quot;
information you are able to pass along to your fellow officers and citizens
of the world might help to alleviate unreasonable fear, so that there would
be less likelihood that we would ever again experience the panic and hysteria
that was created by War of the Worlds a half century ago. Truth is the
best cure for the unknown. A list of some of the available books on Unidentified
Flying Objects (UFOs) is found in Appendix H.</P>

<P>CONCLUSION</P>

<P>Some fire chiefs have little confidence in disaster plans, especially
those dealing with UFOs or enemy attack. If you develop a plan that sets
forth your responsibilities, resources, organizations, supplies, information,
telephone numbers, and special data that will be useful in obtaining help
and fulfilling your role in disaster control, commit it to an electronic
medium, a computer with a capability for continuous updating through modern
word processing. Bring it forth when the need requires. With a good plan,
good leadership, and adequate resources, you may save many lives in any
disaster, including attack from possible enemies.</P>

<P>ARTICLE <A NAME="5"></A>5</P>

<P>THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON</P>

<P>UFOlogists Go Political</P>

<P>Editor s Note: UFOlogists from across the nation grabbed picket signs
and took to the streets of Washington to let the U.S. government know that
they are tired of the secrecy surrounding UFOs and don't plan to take it
any longer.</P>

<P>A group of about 100 protested in the 98 degree heat of July 5th and
were led by a relatively new organization called &quot;The Right to Know,&quot;
organized for the sole purpose of making the voices of &quot;reason&quot;
heard within the halls of Congress. Directed by Ed Komarek of Thomasville,
Georgia, the group met directly across the street from the White House
in a neighboring park to listen to speeches from luminaries in the field,
including the likes of Fate magazine columnist and UFO Universe Contributing
Editor Antonio Huneeus, long time UFO research veteran Larry Bry. UFOs
converged on White House during flap of 1952, though it did nothing to
convince the Pentagon that they should &quot;come clean&quot; on a matter
of a massive cover-up. This is an office photo of the radar screen at Washington
International Airport showing the objects as they converge on their target.</P>

<P>Bry, who has waged a one-man war against Capital Hill's UFO censorship
policy, and yours truly, who reminded the eager protesters that this was
not the first time the subject of flying saucers were of particular attention
to those living in the District of Columbia. I reminded those attending
the rally that back in 1952 strange objects were seen for several days
in a row coming and going over the White House, were picked up on radar,
and were chased by our fastest planes at the time. Even President Truman
took to the airwaves to tell the nation's frightened citizenry not to worry,
that the Air Force was doing its job. Truman--like other presidents before
and since--downplayed the seriousness of the situation and dismissed UFOs
as hallucinations and hoaxes.</P>

<P>But times have changed. And it looks like Operation Right to Know may
be the first successful group to take to the streets to protest what they
see as a grand cosmic whitewash that has involved the last eight presidents.
Those wishing to learn more about the forthcoming activities of the Right
to Know group should contact Ed Komarek at Route 3, Box 1076, Thomasville,
GA 31792. And, by the way, donations are welcome to support the cause just
like they would be to any charitable group.</P>

<P>If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertiveness
and spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should step
aside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, then
they will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,
in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tired
of all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies that
exist within the UFO establishment.</P>

<P>UFO picketers strut their stuff in front of the White House as they
are led by abductes Minder Gerber and Pat Marcattilio.</P>

<P>Why We Marched by Ed Komarek</P>

<P>The spectacular success of Operation Right to Know's second annual UFO
demonstration in Washington, DC shows what a few committed people can do.
Unfortunately, the demonstration would have been a bigger success if the
UFO community had not undermined our efforts in this regard. The UFO establishment
has become extremely conservative and unwilling to experiment and take
risks. It seems that the leaders of the UFO establishment prefer to sit
on their laurels content to hold on to what they have accomplished so far.
Even worse, they undermine the efforts of others like ORTK who are willing
to experiment, take risks and learn from both the successes and failures.
It was very irresponsible for the UFO establishment to come down against
demonstrating when it had never been done before.</P>

<P>It seems to me that the leaders of the UFO establishment have failed
to learn from their adversaries who know that the media are the eyes and
ears of the public. The battle for freedom of inquiry by the public is
carried out in the media. It is essential to get the media on our side
in order to get our message to the public. This message is to look at the
evidence. If the people will not look at the evidence because of the debunking
groups and the tabloid press, then what good is the evidence. If the UFO
establishment is really serious about ending the UFO cover-up, they must
realize that the UFO/ET problem is first and foremost a political problem,
and thus deserves a political solution. What good is science if the data
is being manipulated because of politics.</P>

<P>I suggest that the various UFO groups get together immediately and form
a public relations committee to publicize the evidence.</P>

<P>First and foremost on this committee's agenda should be to publicize
an event like &quot;UFO Awareness Week&quot; by distributing press releases
to every media source in the country about three weeks before the event.
Speakers should be lined up to talk to the press and present the evidence
for UFO/ET's and the massive UFO cover-up. Operation Right To Know has
taken the lead and now it is up to the UFO community to follow that leadership.
We need aggressive, assertive leadership that stands up to irresponsible
reporting on the UFO/ET situation by the media.</P>

<P>Our demonstration in front of the Washington Post protesting their unwillingness
to look at the evidence while attempting to make ORTK out to be a radical
organization put them in their place. As expected, a competitor paper,
the Wall Street Journal, ran an article that forced the Washington Post
to admit Surrounded by picket signs, Tim Biweekly addresses the multitude
from a stage directly across the street from Bill Clinton's home as reporter
Hal MacKinsey looks on.</P>

<P>that the evidence was provocative and they were looking into the UFO/ET
matter. This should be an example to the UFO community not to roll over
and play dead when ridiculed in the press. ORTK again has taken a leadership
position and the UFO community should begin to aggressively deal with irresponsible
reporting by the press.</P>

<P>If the leadership of the UFO community lacks the courage, assertiveness
and spunk needed to end the UFO cover-up quickly then they should step
aside and make way for others that will. If this does not happen, then
they will be superseded by new organizations and new leaders. This is,
in fact, already happening around the country as memberships grow tired
of all the fussing and squabbling and the mutual admiration societies that
exist within the UFO establishment.</P>

<P>ORTK will continue to use all means possible that are legal and non-disruptive
to end the UFO cover-up. We will do this with or without the support of
the UFO establishment. Obviously we would like the overwhelming support
of the UFO community. ORTK has just begun a long process that is essentially
a civil rights movement. Like the civil rights movement for the freedom
of black people that began when a few individuals stood up for their rights,
so are we of ORTK doing the same. Both movements have arisen out of a simmering
discontent that a few courageous individuals catalyzed into political action.</P>

<P>From Truman to Clinton: Presidents and Cosmic Watergate</P>

<P>by Dan Pinchas</P>

<P>In light of President Clinton's recent inauguration, it is worth reviewing
what evidence exists concerning our presidents' knowledge of&quot;the cosmic
Watergate&quot;. Due to the extremely high level of secrecy concerning
the U.S. investigation of UFOs and &quot;IACs&quot; (Identified Alien Crafts),
it is difficult to verify some of this information, much of which is anecdotal.</P>

<P>This information is culled from a variety of published and unpublished
sources. The following is a brief sketch of presidential involvement in
and knowledge of the UFO cover-up.</P>

<P>Truman, Eisenhower, and Roswell</P>

<P>The documents which, if genuine, prove that President Truman was aware
of the recovery of crashed alien spacecraft are at the center of a controversy.
The Truman-Forrestal memorandum of September 24, 1947, if legitimate, would
establish conclusively that Truman established Operation Majestic-12 to
analyze bodies and wreckage recovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Truman
had been quoted as expressing the view that UFOs were real and otherworldly
in origin.</P>

<P>The alleged Eisenhower MJ-12 Briefing Document of November 18, 1952
would indicate that then President-elect Eisenhower was made aware of the
Roswell crash and possibly other crashes.</P>

<P>Of particular interest are allegations that Eisenhower encountered aliens
at Muroc Airfield (Edwards AFB) on Feb The Truman-Forrestal memorandum
of September 24,1947, if legitimate, would establish conclusively that
Truman established Operation Majestic-12 to analyze bodies and wreckage
recovered from the Roswell UFO crash. Truman had been quoted as expressing
the view that UFOs were real and other-worldly in origin.</P>

<P>A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimed
that he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962, and
that Kennedy told him his hands were tied and the whole matter was out
of his hands.</P>

<P>February 20, 1954 as cited in the Gerald Light letter of April 16, 1954,
where Light claims &quot;etherians&quot; and &quot;otherplane aeroforms&quot;
presented themselves. A test pilot who claimed to be present told Britain's
Brinsley Le Poet Trench (Lord Clancarty), that Eisenhower witnessed a demonstration
of technology and power that included a craft and aliens dematerializing
before his eyes, causing Eisenhower great embarrassment. He is alleged
to have told the visitors that &quot;the world is not ready for you.&quot;</P>

<P>Some researchers believe Eisenhower allowed executive power to slip
from the Presidency to MJ12, but there is no concrete evidence to support
this.</P>

<P>JFK: A Would-be Whistleblower?</P>

<P>A former steward on Air Force One during the Kennedy years has claimed
that he discussed UFOs with Kennedy during a flight in December 1962. Kennedy
told him his hands were tied, the whole matter was out of his hands.</P>

<P>A highly controversial claim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligence
source claiming Kennedy informed former Eisenhower national security advisor
and reputed MJ- 12 member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intended
to publicize the alien presence against MJ-12's wishes. The source denied
this was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassination in a covert operation.</P>

<P>While considerable evidence exists of CIA involvement in the assassination
(see Mark Lane, Plausible Denial), there is no concrete evidence supporting
a UFO connection. There is also no available evidence indicating that President
Johnson evinced any knowledge of the UFO cover-up. It is interesting to
note, however, that the alleged landing of an alien craft at Holloman AFB
in April 1964 and conclusion of a government alien agreement would have
occurred in the first months of Johnson's term.</P>

<P>Nixon Knew. Two sources allege President Nixon indicated knowledge of
the UFO coverup. Robert Emenegger, a film producer, was invited to visit
Norton AFB to discuss a documentary on UFOs, which was to incorporate footage
of the abovementioned 1964 alien craft landing at Holloman AFB. Emenegger
allegedly was shown a directive signed by Nixon authorizing release of
the Holoman AFB film, which, needless to say, never was released. When
he broached the subject with White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman,
Haldeman acknowledged familiarity with the Holloman landing but then quickly
changed the subject.</P>

<P>A second source is Beverly McKittrick, comedian Jackie Gleason's second
wife, who said Gleason accompanied his friend Nixon to Homestead AFB in
1973, where he was shown alien bodies in storage. According to McKittrick,
Gleason was visibly shaken by this experience, but would neither confirm
nor deny the report when questioned by others.</P>

<P>Ford Disappointment.</P>

<P>As a Congressman in 1966, Gerald Ford supported a Congressional committee
investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Congressional hearings were held but
accomplished little.</P>

<P>Speculation abounded (fanned by leaks from government sources) that
President Ford, while holding a summit with French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing in Martinique in December 1974, would issue a statement on the
UFO reality, but no statement was released.</P>

<P>Ford responded to a recent inquiry regarding his opinion of UFOs that
his &quot;position hasn't changed.&quot;</P>

<P>Carter Breaks Promise.</P>

<P>President Carter acknowledged seeing a UFO while governor of Georgia
in 1969. During the 1976 election campaign, Carter said, &quot;If I become
President, I'll make every piece of information this country has about
UFO's available to the public and the scientists.&quot; This campaign promise
was not honored.</P>

<P>One reason for this might be an alleged UFO briefing document which
intelligence agents allowed researcher Bill Moore to photograph in 1983.
This document, dated June 14, 1977, contained transcribed notes allegedly
used to brief Carter on Project Aquarius and the UFO/IAC investigation.
A similar document was shown to documentary filmmaker Linda Howe by AFOSI
Special Agent Richard Doty, also in 1983.</P>

<P>It is not possible to determine whether the material is genuine, but
it is likely some type of briefing was provided to Carter relating to UFOs
which caused him to change his mind about public disclosure. A request
by Las Vegas TV anchor George Knapp to interview A highly controversial
claim has been put forth by an Air Force intelligence source claiming Kennedy
informed former Eisenhower national security advisor and reputed MJ-12
member Gordon Gray in a taped 1963 meeting that he intended to publicize
the alien presence against MJ-12's wishes.</P>

<P>The source denied this was a reason that led to Kennedy's assassination
in a covert operation.</P>

<P>Carter regarding this matter several years ago was declined.</P>

<P>Navy physicist Robert Lazar claims to have read briefing documents while
employed at Area 51/S-4 in Nevada describing a clash at an underground
base at Groom Lake between grays and U.S. military personnel in which 22
members of security forces units and 44 government scientists were allegedly
killed (along with an unspecified number of gray casualties). If this 1979
incident did indeed occur, it transpired during the Carter Administration.
There has been no independent verification of the alleged incident.</P>

<P>Reagan a Believer</P>

<P>President Reagan also saw a UFO in 1974 while Governor of California,
a fact he acknowledged in subsequent interviews. Film Producer Steven Spielberg
has told friends that during a private screening of the movie E.T. at the
White House in 1982, Reagan told him that they were among a handful of
people who knew how true it was.</P>

<P>Of greater significance is Reagan's repetition on five separate occasions,
including a 1985 Geneva summit with Soviet President Gorbachev, of the
theme that the nations of the planet would unite if facing an extraterrestrial
threat. When Gorbachev was asked at a summit news conference if he shared
Reagan's views, he responded affirmatively.</P>

<P>Bush: A UFO Insider?</P>

<P>It has been alleged, without evidence, that former Director of Central
Intelligence Bush was Director of MJ-12 in the Reagan Administration. It
is similarly alleged that Vice President Dan Quayle was Director of MJ-12
during the Bush Administration.</P>

<P>Robert Lazar, who allegedly worked as a physicist on nine recovered
(or donated) UFOs at Area 51/S-4, has stated his belief that Bush was familiar
with the project Lazar was working on. Researcher Jorge Martin has reported
that Bush as Vice President visited the remote Cabo Rojo area in Puerto
Rico where UFOs are frequently sighted and where abductees have reportedly
being abducted by grays acting in collusion with U.S. military personnel.
It has been alleged that an underground base may exist in the vicinity.
with U.S. military personnel. It has been alleged that an underground base
may exist in the vicinity. Russian UFOlogist Marina Popovich was told by
senior advisors to former Soviet President Gorbachev that he and Bush discussed
the disappearance of the unmanned Soviet spacecraft Phobos II in orbit
around Mars at their 1989 summit conference in Malta. Contact was lost
with Phobos II after it sent back pictures of a huge 12.5 mile long elliptical
UFO orbiting around the Mars moon of Phobos.</P>

<P>Will Clinton Follow Tradition?</P>

<P>Past experience strongly indicates that President Clinton and Vice President
Gore will receive, or have already received, briefings on the alien presence
on Earth. Precedent also indicates that Clinton is unlikely to make the
information public unless MJ- 12 (or its equivalent under a different name)
is in agreement.</P>

<P>Every President since Truman appears to have had knowledge of UFO secrets
and yet none has made the information public. If Operation Right to Know
is successful, this pattern of silence and cover-up will be broken for
good.</P>

<P>SECURITY It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or
the automat- ion of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation
systems (SILENT WEAPONS) on a NATIONAL or WORLDWIDE SCALE without implying
extensive OBJECTIVES of SOCIAL CONTROL and DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN LIFE, i.e.,
SLAVERY and GENOCIDE. This manual is in itself an analog declaration of
intent. Such a writing must be SECURED FROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY. Otherwise,
it might be recognized as a TECHNICALLY FORMAL DECLARATION OF DOMESTIC
WAR. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position
of great power and WITHOUT FULL KNOWLEDGE and CONSENT OF THE PUBLIC, USES
SUCH KNOWLEDGE and METHODOLOGY FOR ECONOMIC CONQUEST- it must be understood
that A STATE OF DOMESTIC WARFARE EXISTS between said person or group of
persons and the public. The SOLUTION of today's PROBLEMS REQUIRES an approach
which is RUTHLESSLY CANDID, with NO AGONIZING OVER RELIGIOUS, MORAL or
CULTURAL VALUES. YOU have QUALIFIED for this project BECAUSE of your ABILITY
to LOOK at HUMAN SOCIETY with COLD OBJECTIVITY, and yet analyze and DISCUSS
your OBSERVATIONS and CONCLUSIONS with OTHERS of similar INTELLECTUAL capacity
WITHOUT a LOSS of DISCRETION or HUMILITY. Such virtues are exercised in
your own best interest. Do not deviate from them.</P>

<P>WC/Author's Note:All above emphasis are mine as are those in the following
two sections and including bracketed additions throughout.</P>

<P>I do recognize this document, based upon the document's own admission,
as a formal Declaration of War by the Illuminati upon the citizens of the
United States of America. I acknowledge that a State of War exists and
has existed between the Citizens of the United States of America and the
Illuminati aggressor based upon this recognition. I present to you that
the peaceful Citizens of this nation are fully justified in taking whatever
steps may be necessary, including violence, to identify, counterattack,
and destroy the enemy. I base this statement upon the God-given right of
any peaceful people</P>

<P>to defend themselves against attack and destruction by any enemy waging
war against them. I cite the principles outlined in the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution of the United States of America, and the
fully recognized and acknowledged historical precedents that have served
as the justification for destruction of tyrants.</P>

<P>HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations
Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the
MILITARY MANAGEMENT (Eisenhower) in England during World War II. the original
purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tactical
problems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use of
limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e.,logistics). It
was soon recognized by those in positions of power [THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN
RELATIONS] that the same methods might be useful for totally controlling
a society. But better tools were necessary. Social engineering (the analysis
and automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amounts
of constantly changing economic information (data), so a high-speed computerized
data-processing systems was necessary which could race ahead of the society
and predict when society would arrive for capitulation. Relay computers
were too slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper
Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill. The next breakthrough was
the development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 by
the mathematician George B. Dantzig. Then in 1948, the transistor, invented
by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion
of the computer field by reducing space and power requirements. With these
three inventions under their direction, those in positions of power strongly
suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with
the push of a button. Immediately, the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION got in on
the ground floor by making a four-year grant to HARVARD COLLEGE, funding
the HARVARD ECONOMIC RESEARCH PROJECT for the study of the structure of
the American economy. One year later, in 1949, THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
joined in. In 1952 the original grant period terminated, and a high-level
meeting of the ELITE [Illuminati] was held to determine the next phase
of social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful,
as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting
the feasibility of economic (social) engineering. (Studies in the Structure
of the American Economy--copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontief, International
Sciences Press Inc., White Plains, New York.) Engineered in the last half
of the decade of the 1940s, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak,
in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954. With the
creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking UN LIMITED SOURCES
OF FUSION ATOMIC ENERGY FROM THE HEAVY HYDROGEN IN SEA WATER and the consequent
availability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away.
The combination was irresistible. The QUIET WAR was quietly DECLARED by
the INTERNATIONAL ELITE [THE BILDERBERG GROUP] at a meeting held in 1954.
Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the
evolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks.
This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War.
Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout
the world.</P>

<P>POLITICAL INTRODUCTION</P>

<P>In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that
it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public
would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power, for the very elements
of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopia
as they were for providing a private utopia. The ISSUE of PRIMARY CONCERN,
that of DOMINANCE, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences.</P>

<P>ENERGY</P>

<P>Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science
is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science,
theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control
of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore,
mathematics is the primary energy science. And the book- keeper can be
king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.
All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end
is control. [THE END ALWAYS JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.] Beyond this remains only
one issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of concern.
Although the so- called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of
the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people
who will not use their intellegence are no better than animals who do not
have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table
by choice and consent. CONSEQUENTLY, in the interest of future world order,
peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against
the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting
the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible
many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few.
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure,
and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons
so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public
appearance as to earn for themselves the name &quot;silent weapons.&quot;
In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the
magnates of capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods)
and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predict-
able and manipulatable. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,
the low-class elements of the society must be brought under total control,
i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social
duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to question
the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-
class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation
of the parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care centers
for the occupationally orphaned children. The quality of education given
to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so the moat of ignorance
isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible
to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower
class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from
their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintaining
some measure of social order, peace, and tranquility for the ruling upper
crust.</P>

<P>DESCRIPTIVE INTRODUCTION OF THE SILENT WEAPON</P>

<P>Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from
a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.
It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing,</P>

<P>instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data,
instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated
by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a
banking magnate, instead of a military general. It makes no obvious explosive
noises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously
interfere with anyone's daily social life. Yet it makes an unmistakable
&quot;noise,&quot; causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and
unmistakably interferes with daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a
trained observer, one who knows what to look for. The public cannot comprehend
this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked
and subdued by a weapon. The public might instinctively feel that something
is wrong [ISN'T THAT THE TRUTH?], but because of the technical nature of
the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way,
or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how
to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend
themselves against it. When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public
adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment
on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes
tot great and they crack up. Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of
biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the
individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking
their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental,
and emotional strengths and weaknesses.</P>

<P>THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION Give me control over a nation's currency, and
I care not who makes its laws. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743-1812)</P>

<P>Today's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered,
succinctly expressed, and effectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer Amschel
Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component of
economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think
of his discovery in these 20th century terms, and , to be sure, mathematical
analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise of
the electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control
of the world economy.</P>

<P>GENERAL ENERGY CONCEPTS</P>

<P>In the study of energy systems, there always appear three elementary
concepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipation.
And corresponding to these concepts, there are three idealize, essentially
pure physical counterparts called passive components. (1) In the science
of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of potential energy is associated
with a physical property called elasticity or stiffness, and can be represented
by a stretched spring. In electronic science, potential energy is stored
in a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacitance
instead of elasticity or stiffness. (2)In the science of physical mechanics,
the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical property
called inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass of a flywheel
in motion. In electronic science, kinetic energy is stored in an inductor
(in a magnetic field) instead of mass. This property is called inductance
in- stead of inertia. (3)In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon
of energy</P>

<P>dissipation is associated with a physical property called friction or
resistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other device which converts
system energy into heat. In electronic science, dissipation of energy is
performed by an element called either a resistor or a conductor, the term
&quot;resistor&quot; being the one generally used to express the concept
of friction, and the term &quot;conductor&quot; being generally used to
describe a more ideal device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronic
energy efficiently from one location to another. The property of a resistance
or conductor is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals.
In economics these three energy concepts are associated with: (1)Economic
Capacitance-Capital (money, stock/inventory, investments in buildings and
durables, etc. ) (2)Economic Conductance-Goods (production flow coefficients)
(3)Economic Inductance-Services (the influence of the population of industry
on output) All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of one
energy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, etc.) can be immediately applied
in the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics).</P>

<P>MR. ROTHSCHILD'S ENERGY DISCOVERY</P>

<P>What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power,
influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle
is &quot;when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to
you.&quot; Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan
accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to INDUCE
PEOPLE [WC emphasis] (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic
field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of
greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateral
in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he
could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone's
stock of gold as a persuader to show to his customers. Mr. Rothschild loaned
his promissory notes to individuals and to governments. These would create
overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the
system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts.
The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a
war. Then he would control the avail- ability of currency to determine
who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control
of its economic system got his support. Collection of debts was guaranteed
by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this
economic methodology made Mr. Rothschild all the more able to extend his
wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed
by government order BEYOND THE LIMITS [WC emphasis] (inflation) of backing
in precious metal or the production of goods and services (gross national
product, GNP).</P>

<P>APPARENT CAPITAL AS &quot;PAPER&quot; INDUCTOR</P>

<P>In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called &quot;currency,&quot;
has the appearance of capital, but is, in fact, negative capital. Hence,
it has the appearance of service, but is, in fact, indebtedness or debt.
It is there- fore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance,
and if balanced in no other way, will be balanced by the negotiation of
population (war, genocide)&gt; The total goods and services represent real
capital called the gross national product, and currency may be printed
up to this level and still represent economic capacitance; but currency
printed beyond this level is subtractive, represents the introduction of
economic inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness. War is therefore
the balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public which
we have taught to exchange true value for</P>

<P>inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources
of nature and regeneration of those resources. Mr. Rothschild had discovered
that currency gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to
his own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positions
which would encourage the great- est economic instability and oscillation.
The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient
data and high-speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic
oscillations created by price stocking and excess paper energy credits-
paper inductance/inflation.</P>

<P>BREAKTHROUGH</P>

<P>The aviation field provided the greatest evolution in economic engineering
by way of the mathematical theory of shock testing. In this process, a
projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the
recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe
and wired to chart recorders. By studying the echoes or reflections of
the recoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover critical
vibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations of
the engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of the
two, might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of the airframe
in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of engineering, this means
that the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in terms
of vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated.</P>

<P>APPLICATION IN ECONOMICS</P>

<P>To use this method of airframe shock testing in economic engineering,
the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction
is monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted
theoretically by computers and the psycho-economic structure of the economy
us thus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential and
difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and
make possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative consumer
structure). Then the response of the household to future shocks can be
predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal
with its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated
social energy bookkeeping system. Eventually every individual element of
the structure comes under computer control trough a knowledge of personal
preferences, such know- ledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer
preferences (universal product code--UPC-- zebra-stripe pricing codes on
packages) with identified consumers (identified via association with the
use of a credit card and LATER A PERMANENT &quot;TATTOOED&quot; BODY NUMBER
[WC emphasis] invisible under normal ambient illumination...</P>

<P>THE ECONOMIC MODEL</P>

<P>...The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension of
World War II Operations Research. Its purpose was to discover the science
of controlling an economy: at first the American economy, and then the
world economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation
and data, it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of
an economy as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Such
has proven to be the case. Moreover, the economy has been transformed into
a guided missile on target. The immediate aim of the Harvard project was
to discover the economic structure, what forces change that structure,
how the behavior of the</P>

<P>structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What was
needed was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures and
interrelationships of investment, production, distribution, and consumption.</P>

<P>To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed
the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and
practical and computer know-how developed for the electronic field could
be directly applied in the study of economics. This discovery was not openly
declared, and its more subtle implications were and are kept a closely
guarded secret, for example that in an economic model, human life is measured
in dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a switch
connected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous to the initiation
of a war. The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was the
accurate description of the household as an industry. This is a challenge
because consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influenced
by income, price, and other economic factors. This hurdle was cleared in
an indirect and statistically approximate was by an application of shock
testing to determine the current characteristics, called current technical
coefficients, of a household industry. Finally, because problems in theoretical
economics can be translated very easily into problems in theoretical electronics,
and the solution translated back again, it follows that only a book of
language translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics.
The remainder could be gotten from standard works on mathematics and electronics.
This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary,
and greatly simplifies project security.</P>

<P>INDUSTRIAL DIAGRAMS</P>

<P>An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from other
industries in several forms and converts [it] into one specific product
for sales and distribution to other industries. It has several inputs and
one output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really
an industrial complex where several industries under one roof produce one
or more products...</P>

<P>THREE INDUSTRIAL CLASSES</P>

<P>Industries fall into three categories or classes by type of output:
Class #1--Capital (resources) Class #2--Goods (commodities or use-dissipative)
Class #3--Services (action of population) Class #1 industries exist at
three levels: (1)Nature-sources of energy and raw materials. (2)Government-printing
of currency equal to gross national product (GNP), and extension (inflation)
of currency in excess of GNP. (3)Banking-loaning of money for interest,
and extension (inflation/ counterfeiting) of economic value through deposit
loan accounts. Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer
(disopited) products. This sort of activity is usually recognized and labeled
by the public as an &quot;industry.&quot; Class #3 industries are those
which have service rather than a tangible product as their output. These
industries are called (1)households, and (2) governments. Their output
is human activity of a mechanical sort, and their basis is population.</P>

<P>AGGREGATION</P>

<P>The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry model
if one allows the names of the outputs to be (1)capital, (2)goods, and
(3)services. The problem with this representation is that it would not</P>

<P>show the influence of, say, the textile industry on the ferrous metal
industry. This is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metal
industry would be contained within a single classification called the &quot;goods
industry&quot; and by this process of combining or aggregating these two
industries under one system block they would lose their economic individuality.</P>

<P>THE E-MODEL</P>

<P>A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production, distribution,
consumption, and investment. If all of these elements including labor and
human functions are assigned a numerical value in like units of measure,
say, 1939 dollars, then this flow can be further represented by a current
flow in an electronic circuit, and its behavior can be predicted and manipulated
with useful precision. The three ideal passive energy components of electronics,
the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three ideal
passive energy components of economics called the pure industries of capital,
goods, and services, respectively. Economic capacitance represents the
storage of capital in one form or another. Economic conductance represents
the level of conductance of materials for the production of goods. Economic
inductance represents the inertia of economic value in motion. This is
a population phenomenon known as services.</P>

<P>ECONOMIC INDUCTANCE</P>

<P>An electrical inductor (e.g., a coil of wire) has an electric current
as its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon
(inertia). Corresponding to this, an economic inductor has a flow of economic
value as its primary phenomenon and a population field as its secondary
phenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic value (e.g., money) diminishes,
the human population field collapses in order to keep the economic value
(money) flowing (extreme case--war). This public inertia is a result of
consumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is generally
a phenomenon of self-preservation.</P>

<P>INDUCTIVE FACTORS TO CONSIDER</P>

<P>(1)Population (2)Magnitude of the economic activities of the government
(3)The method of financing these government activities (See Peter-Paul
Principle--inflation of the currency.)</P>

<P>TRANSLATION (A few examples will be given.) Charge--cous--dollars (1939).
Flow/Current--amperes (coulombs per second)--dollars of flow per year.
Motivating Force--volts--dollars (output) demand. Conductance--amperes
per volt--dollars of flow per year per dollar demand. Capacitance--coulombs
per volt--dollars of production inventory/ stock per dollar demand.</P>

<P>TIME FLOW RELATIONSHIPS AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE OSCILLATIONS</P>

<P>An ideal industry may be symbolized electronically in various ways.
The simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by
a current. When this is done, the relationship between the two becomes
what is called an admittance, which can result from three economic factors:</P>

<P>(1) hindsight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) foresight flow. Foresight
flow is the result of that property of living entities to cause energy
(food) to be stored for a period of low energy (e.g.,a winter season).
It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period of
low energy (winter season). In a production industry it takes several forms,
one of which is known as production stock or inventory. In electronic symbology
this specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is represented
by capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge.
Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loading
effect of inventory priorities. Present flow ideally involves no delays.
It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a &quot;hand to mouth&quot;
flow. In electronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure use
industry) is represented by a conduchance which is then a simple economic
valve (a dissipative element). Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia.
In electronics this phenomenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economic
analog=a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog=flow
of money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog=active human population)
which, if the current (money flow) begins to diminish, collapse (war) to
maintain the current (flow of money--energy). Other large alternatives
to war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-ended social
welfare program, or an ENORMOUS (but fruitful) OPEN-ENDED SPACE PROGRAM
[WC emphasis]. The problem with stabilizing the economic system is that
there is too much demand on account of (1) too much greed and (2) too much
population. This creates excessive economic inductance which can only be
balanced with economic capacitance (true resources or value--e.g.,in goods
or services). The social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended
credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive
people a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can be
useful, however, because the recipients become state property in return
for the &quot;gift,&quot; a standing army for the elite. For he who pays
the piper picks the tune. Those who get hooked on the economic drug, must
go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large amounts
of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future &quot;credit&quot;
of the world. This is a fourth law of motion--onset, and consists of performing
an action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns
to the point of action--a delayed reaction. The means of surviving the
reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this
means, politicians become popular in their own time and the public pays
for it later. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.
The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the
limit of the gross national product, an economic process called inflation.
[Note:REMEMBER THAT INFLATION IS ONLY THE ACT OF PRINTING MONEY IN EXCESS
OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THEY COULD BLAME IT ON THE PRICE OF WIDGETS
OR OIL ONLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW THE REAL CAUSE. THE REAL CAUSE AND THE
ONLY CAUSE OF INFLATION IS THE PRINTING OF MORE MONEY BEYOND THE GROSS
NATIONAL PRODUCT.] This puts a large quantity of money into the hands of
the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a false
self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door.</P>

<P>They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because war
ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians
are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility
and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and
social-economic structuring.)</P>

<P>If people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their
appetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operate
on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy
the bum. Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,
there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the
system. (1)Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which
will only result in a total destruction of the living earth. (2)Take control
of the world by the use of economic &quot;silent weapons&quot; in a form
of &quot;quiet warfare&quot; and reduce the economic inductance of the
world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.
The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this
point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about
the silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improve
its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd
of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of
the earth. They do not care enough about economic science to learn why
they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their
religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders
the solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them. It is left to
those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to
survive, to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.
Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapons would destroy our only hope of
preserving the seed of future true humanity....</P>

<P>THE HOUSEHOLD INDUSTRY</P>

<P>The industries of finance (banking), manufacturing, and government,
real counterparts of the pure industries of capital, goods, and services,
are easily defined because they are generally logically structured. Because
of this their processes can be described mathematically and their technical
coefficients can be easily deduced. This, however, is not the case with
the service industry known as the household industry.</P>

<P>HOUSEHOLD MODELS</P>

<P>...The problem which a theoretical economist faces is that the consumer
preferences of any household is not easily predictable and the technical
coefficients of any one household extend to be a nonlinear, very complex,
and variable function of income, prices, etc.</P>

<P>Computer information derived from the use of the universal product code
in conjunction with credit-card purchase as an individual household identifier
could change this state of affairs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet available
on a national or even a significant regional scale. To compensate for this
data deficiency, an alternate indirect approach of analysis has been adopted
known as economic shock testing. This method, widely used in the aircraft
manufacturing industry, develops an aggregate statistical sort of data.
Applied to economics, this means that all of the households in one region
or in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than individually,
and the mass behavior rather than individual behavior is used to discover
useful estimates of the technical coefficients of the household industry
depends upon shocking the prices of a commodity and noting the changes
in the sales of all the commodities.</P>

<P>ECONOMIC SHOCK TESTING</P>

<P>In recent times, the application of Operations Research to the study
of the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles
of shock testing. In the shock testing of an aircraft airframe, the recoil
impulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe causes shock waves in
that structure</P>

<P>which tell aviation engineers the conditions under which parts of the
airplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutter
like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fork, and disintegrate
or fall apart in flight. Economic engineers achieve the same result in
studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefully
selecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar,
and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability,
thus kicking every- body's budget and buying habits out of shape. They
then observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes in
advertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities. The objective
of such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy into
a predictable state of motion or change, even a con- trolled self-destructive
state of motion which will convince the public that certain &quot;expert&quot;
people should take control of the money system and reestablish security
(rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are
rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, become
totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor. Not only the prices of commodities,
but also the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing.
Labor strikes deliver excellent tests shocks to an economy, especially
in the critical service areas of trucking (transportation), communication,
public utilities (energy, water, garbage collection), etc. By shock testing,
it is found that there is a direct relationship between the availability
of money flowing in an economy and the psychological outlook and response
of masses of people dependent upon that availability. For example, there
is a measurable quantitative relationship between the price of gasoline
and the probability that a person would experience a headache, feel a need
to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug
of beer. It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economic
modes by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from
reality, and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Re- search,
it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination
of created events (shocks) which will bring about a complete control and
subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (by
shaking the plum tree)...</P>

<P>INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC AMPLIFIERS</P>

<P>Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering.
The basic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic)
is that is receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an
independent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable
relationship to that input control signal. The simplest form of economic
amplifier is a device called advertising. If a person is spoken to by a
T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year- old, then, due to suggestibility,
he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion
with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his
economic reservoir and deliver its energy to buy that product on impulse
when he passes it in the store. An economic amplifier may have several
inputs and outputs. Its response might be instantaneous or delayed. Its
circuit symbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative,
&quot;go&quot; or &quot;no go,&quot; or it might have its parametric input/output
relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented.
Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy
from a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control
signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component.
Economic Amplifiers fall into classes called strategies, and, in comparison
with electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economic
amplifier are called logistical instead of electrical.</P>

<P>Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also,
in effect, are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry. In the
design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least five
functions, which are:</P>

<P>(1) the available input signals, (2) the desired output-control objectives,
(3) the strategic objective, (4) the available economic power sources,
(5) the logistical options.</P>

<P>The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating
the economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called
GAME THEORY [WC emphasis]. The design of an economic amplifier begins with
a specification of the power level of the output, which can range from
personal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e.,
how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. High
gain combined with strong feedback helps deliver the required precision.
Most of the error will be in the input data signal. Personal input data
tends to be specific, while national input data tends to be statistical.</P>

<P>TABLE OF STRATEGIES</P>

<P>DO THIS TO GET THIS Keep the public ignorant Less public organization
Maintain access to control Required reaction to outputs (prices,sales)
points for feedback Create preoccupation Lower defenses Attack the family
unit Control of the education of the young Give less cash and More self-indulgence
and more data credit to the doles Attack the privacy Destroy faith in this
sort of government of the church Social conformity Computer programming
simplicity Minimize the tax protest Maximum economic data, minimum enforcement
problems Stabilize the consent Simplicity coefficients Tighten control
of variables Simpler computer input data--greater predictability Establish
boundary Problem simplicity/solutions of differential conditions and difference
equations. Proper timing Less data shift and blurring Maximize control
Minimum resistance to control Collapse of currency Destroy the faith of
the American people in each other. [WC: Ultimate objective--New World Order]</P>

<P>DIVERSION, THE PRIMARY STRATEGY</P>

<P>Experience has proven that the SIMPLEST METHOD of securing a silent
weapon and gaining control of the public is to KEEP THE PUBLIC UNDISCIPLINED
AND IGNORANT of basic systems principles on the one hand, WHILE KEEPING
THEM CONFUSED, DISORGANIZED, AND DISTRACTED with matters of no real importance
on the other hand. [WC all emphases.] This is achieved by: (1) disengaging
their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality
program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics;
and discouraging technical creativity. (2) engaging their emotions, increasing
their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities,
by: (a) unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional
rape) by way of a constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media--especially
the T.V. and the newspapers. (b) giving them what they desire--in excess--&quot;junk
food for thought&quot;--and depriving them of what they really need. (3)
REWRITING HISTORY and LAW and SUBJECTING THE PUBLIC TO THE DEVIANT CREATION,
thus being able to SHIFT THEIR THINKING from personal needs to highly fabricated
outside priorities. [WC all emphases.] These preclude their interest in
and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology. The
general rule is that there is profit in confusion; the more confusion,
the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and
then offer the solutions.</P>

<P>DIVERSION SUMMARY</P>

<P>Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social
issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance. Schools: Keep
the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law,
and REAL HISTORY [WC emphasis]. Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment
below sixth-grade level. Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no
time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.</P>

<P>CONSENT, THE PRIMARY VICTORY</P>

<P>A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public
by legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available
to silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service.
(See Studies in the Structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source
list.) This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organized
data contained in federal and state tax forms collected, assembled, and
submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers. Furthermore,
the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator
of public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other
data sources are given in the Short List of Inputs. Consent Coefficients--numerical
feedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government
is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation,
it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consenting
to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator
of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite
an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government.</P>

<P>AMPLIFICATION ENERGY SOURCES</P>

<P>The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discovering
the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic
system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of the
people to labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level,
or class in the social structure; i.e., to provide labor at various levels
in the pecking order. Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income,
controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure.
This provides stability and security, but also government from the top.
As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class
elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious
of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to
attain a knowledge of energy systems and the ability to enforce their rise
through the class structure. This threatens the sovereignty of the elite.
If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elite
can achieve energy dominance, and LABOR BY CONSENT NO LONGER WILL HOLD
A POSITION [WC emphasis] of an essential economic energy source. Until
such energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of people
to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration,
since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final
transfer of energy sources to the control of the elite. It is essential
to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key
to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification. Therefore,
consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered.</P>

<P>LOGISTICS</P>

<P>The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of
inputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the input and the outputs, and
the available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is called
logistics. A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first,
and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary
factors. This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken down
into its subsystems, and these in turn are analyzed, until, by this process,
one arrives at the logistical &quot;atom,&quot; THE INDIVIDUAL [WC emphasis].
This is where the process of SYNTHESIS [WC emphasis] properly begins, and
at the time of the birth of the individual.</P>

<P>THE ARTIFICIAL WOMB</P>

<P>From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort is
directed toward building, maintaining, and withdrawing into artificial
wombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells. The objective
of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stable
and unstable activity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes
of growth and maturity--i.e., survival; to provide security for freedom
and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity. This is equally
true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite
difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems.</P>

<P>THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A NATION-- DEPENDENCY</P>

<P>The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a
political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their
own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human
god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their
bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck
them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright [sic]
when they wake up in the morning.</P>

<P>The public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets
incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering
nothing.</P>

<P>So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the &quot;godfather&quot;?
This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency.
It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against
disgusting public.</P>

<P>ACTION/OFFENSE</P>

<P>Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings
which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with
the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might
raise. Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including their
own children) so as to keep the blood off their own hands. They rave about
the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger
from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But
even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association
of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption
in the government.</P>

<P>RESPONSIBILITY</P>

<P>Again, most people want to be free to do things (to explore, etc.) but
they are afraid to fail. The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility,
and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to others
where success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law)
which the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word--&quot;author&quot;),
but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politicians
to face reality for them.</P>

<P>SUMMARY</P>

<P>The people hire the politicians so that the people can: (1) obtain security
without managing it. (2) obtain action without thinking about it. (3) inflict
theft, injury, and death upon others without having to con- template either
life or death. (4) avoid responsibility for their own intentions. (5) obtain
the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the
discipline of facing or learning either of these things.</P>

<P>They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine
to: (1) provide for the survival of the NATION/WOMB (2) prevent encroachment
of anything upon the NATION/WOMB (3) destroy the enemy who threatens the
NATION/WOMB (4) destroy those citizens of their own country who do not
conform for the sake of stability of the NATION/WOMB Politicians hold many
quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the
attorneys and the C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed),
and the judges who shout the orders and run the</P>

<P>closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals
are industrialists. The &quot;presidential&quot; level of commander-in-chief
is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have
created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but
they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite. Thus, a nation becomes
divided into two very distinct parts, a DOCILE SUB-NATION [great silent
majority] and a POLITICAL SUB-NATION. The political sub-nation remains
attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance
until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.</P>

<P>SYSTEM ANALYSIS</P>

<P>In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war,
the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical
values to each element of the war structure--personnel and material alike.
This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems
of such a structure.</P>

<P>THE DRAFT (As military service)</P>

<P>Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more
effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft.
a primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by
intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction
that the government is omnipotent. [WC Note: The truth is just the opposite,
as government exists only with the consent of the people.] He is soon taught
that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus,
a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life
can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of
his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction
is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill. EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS
THE PROCESS BY WHICH A YOUNG MAN'S PARENTS, WHO PURPORTEDLY LOVE HIM, CAN
BE INDUCED TO SEND HIM OFF TO WAR TO HIS DEATH [WC emphasis]. Although
the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full
detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve
to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in
a computer analysis of social and war systems. We begin with a tentative
definition of the draft. THE DRAFT (selective service, etc.) is an institution
of COMPULSORY collective SACRIFICE and SLAVERY, devised by the middle-aged
and the elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public
dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders,
thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational
Stabilizer). It is marketed and sold to the public under the label of &quot;patriotic=national&quot;
service. Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that
definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human
Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory.
The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values,
a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service
job demand, etc. Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively
evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists.
Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of
social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction
to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands
upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing
his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a
banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.</P>

<P>Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime
espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical
models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to
predetermine these events with maximum certainty. That does not exist by
natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings
are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little
real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.
These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table
of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true
measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently
inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to
give the economy a false kinetic energy (&quot;paper&quot; inductance).
The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with
a gram of silver today as could be bought in 1920. Human value measured
in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.</P>

<P>ENFORCEMENT</P>

<P>FACTOR I As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only
by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction pat-
terns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous. As in other
human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive)
is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action
and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.
To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family
unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control.</P>

<P>FACTOR II--FATHER The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure
that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes.
The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be
is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that
he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life
will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to
see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable
behavior. By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a
backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the
censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment
he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war
or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose
not withstanding.</P>

<P>FACTOR III--MOTHER The female element of human society is ruled by emotion
first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination
always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the
child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby
is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source
of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition
to &quot;reality&quot; when it comes, or sooner. As the transition becomes
more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated,
and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers
must become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment
of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation
of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory).
CAUTION: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's
power must never be</P>

<P>FACTOR IV--JUNIOR The emotional pressure for self-preservation during
time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have
an option to avoid the battlefield--if junior can be persuaded to go--is
all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their
quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: &quot;No sacrifice, no friends;
no glory, no girlfriends.&quot;</P>

<P>FACTOR V--SISTER And what about junior's sister? She is given all the
good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her
future husband regardless of the price.</P>

<P>FACTOR VI--CATTLE Those who will not use their brains are no better
off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish,
father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers
of the same.</P>

<P>WC/Author's Note: So now you know. This chapter could only come in the
beginning. Your preconceived ideas had to be shattered in order for you
to understand the rest of this book. In this chapter you can see every
step that the elite have taken in their war to control this once great
nation. You can see the steps that will be taken in the future. You can
no longer pretend innocence. Your denial of the conspiracy will fall on
deaf ears. This book is part of the education that will give Americans
the weapons needed in the coming months and years of hardship as the New
World Order struggles to be born.</P>

<P>Many will argue that &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars&quot; is only
a bogus conglomeration of words for which the writer has never taken credit
or responsibility. Those who do so ignore the self-evident truths contained
within the document. They ignore these truths because they are an indictment
of their own ignorance, which they cannot face.</P>

<P>The document, first found in 1969, correctly outlines events which subse-
quently came to pass. It cannot be ignored or dismissed. The document is
genuine. Its truths cannot be negated or shrugged away. The message is
this: You must accept that you have been cattle and the ultimate consequence
of being cattle--which is slavery--or you must prepare to fight, and if
necessary die to preserve your God-given right to Freedom.</P>

<P>That last sentence is the real reason why people choose to ignore &quot;Silent
Weapons for Quiet Wars.&quot; People are not ready to admit that they have
been cattle. They are not prepared to fight, and if necessary to die, for
Freedom. It is an indictment of the citizens of the United States of America.
And that is the total confirmation of the truth of the information contained
in &quot;Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.&quot;</P>

<P>The Anomalous Events of STS-48 by Vince Johnson </P>

<P>The anomalous events during the shuttle Discovery mission STS-48 (launched
September 12, 1991) were originally revealed by space enthusiasts who had
set their VCRs to record NASA Select TV, which at the time was downlinked
live from each shuttle mission and distributed on cable and satellite TV.
To record as much as possible, VCRs were set to record at slow speed (six
hour recordings) which resulted in less than optimal recordings. When the
recordings were reviewed, anomalous objects were seen at several points
in the mission. Although the existence of these recordings have been known
to MUFON and FUFOR since the fall of 1991, surprisingly, they were not
made public until Don Ecker appeared on &quot;HardCopy,&quot; and later,
&quot;Larry King Live&quot; with a poor copy of what has been termed Event
2 in June of this year. After personally reviewing the video of Events
1,2,3,4 and 6, some of which were obtained from the official NASA video
archive, I can only surmise that the events are indeed anomalous and unexplained.
The official NASA explanation of ice and debris seems unlikely due to the
different directions and speeds the objects appear to be traveling. The
following is a chronology of the anomalous events of STS-48: EVENT 1 (9-13-91
/ between 03:49 - 04:10 GMT) The camera shows a beautiful view from the
forward cabin looking back through the cargo bay at the tail section with
the Earth filling the top of the screen. One-by-one, a series of five lights
travel radially from behind the tail section, comprising an arc. Then an
extremely bright blinking light appears, traveling up from behind the left
engine. This bright light occupies the focus of the arc composed of the
five smaller lights. Then the camera inexplicably pans down into the cargo
bay, focusing on a piece of equipment there. After a minute, the ground
controller requests that she be given control of the camera. After a short
pause, the astronaut complies. The camera then pans back up into the tail
area. The lights that were there just moments before are now gone. EVENT
2 (9-15-91 / between 20:30 - 20:45 GMT) This scene shows the nightside
Earth filling most of the frame with the horizon extending from the upper
left of screen to the lower right. Black space is seen above the horizon
at the screen's upper right. Clouds, bright city lights on the surface,
and an intense lightning storm can be seen. The atmosphere is slightly
luminescent at the limb and is clearly discernible. Against this background,
several lighted objects can be seen traveling slowly, apparently above
the atmosphere. One of the larger objects (2A -see Event2a.GIF) appears
and slowly moves across the sky below. Another large object (2F) appears
near the center of the screen, either traveling up through the atmosphere
from below, or through it at the limb and traveling towards the shuttle.
This object travels slowly, parallel to the horizon, from lower right to
upper left. Suddenly, a bright flash of light fills the screen. As the
flash diminishes, two odd streaks of light emanate from the left. The object
traveling parallel to the horizon executes an acute (less than 90 degree)
turn and shoots off into space, dimming as it recedes. The upper of the
two streaks would have intercepted the object traveling along the horizon
if it had stayed on its course without making its sudden turn. The bottom
streak shoots off towards the right of the screen. Throughout Event 2,
other lighted objects move across the field of view at varying speeds and
headings. Note: The official NASA explanation for this event is that ice
crystals are being propelled by a shuttle attitude thruster being fired.
The fact that the Earth does not appear to shift in the frame indicates
that the shuttle's attitude is not changed and therefore, no thruster is
being fired during this event. EVENT 3 (9-16-91 / 08:40 -09:10 GMT) This
scene shows the sunlit Earth filling the screen. Other than cloud formations,
no surface details are discernible. This clip can only be described as
chaotic. There are dozens of objects streaking in every direction. Although
sizes and distances cannot be calculated from the video alone, many of
these objects appear to be descending into, and flying through the atmosphere.
There is a similar streak as in Event 2 that intercepts one of the objects.
After about 30- 45 seconds of this, a larger elliptical white object appears
in the extreme upper left corner of the frame. This object is visible for
only 5-6 frames before another camera is switched on showing the side of
the shuttle with empty black space in the background. Note: Again, there
is no apparent change in the shuttle's orientation during this event, indicating
that no thruster is being fired. Chronologically, Event 3 occurs after
Event 4. The numbering system developed before all video was available
to researchers. EVENT 4 (9-15-91 / between 19:00 - 19:10 GMT) While few
details of the objects were apparent to me, researcher Vince DiPietro reports
that a large bell-shaped object appears, and that other objects move from
the bottom to the top of the screen. His analysis allegedly reveals that
several of these objects have an oblong shape, with sections of the objects
appearing to rotate at high speed. EVENT 5 (Video, date and time unavailable)
According to Vince DiPietro, a large &quot;tubular shaped&quot; object
moves from right to left. Also, DiPietro reports that a pulsating light
is seen at the top of the screen Note: HUFON Report has not seen video
of Event 5. According to our source, Ron Madeley, this event has been expunged
from the official NASA STS-48 video archive, leaving a 14 minute gap in
the video's time code. If this is true, it would be irrefutable evidence
of a NASA cover-up. EVENT 6 (Date and time unavailable) The sunlit Earth
fills the screen, with no surface details (other than clouds) discernible.
A bright object enters the frame at left center and zips across the screen
at high speed. When played in normal mode, the object seems to be a white
light traveling in a smooth trajectory. When advanced frame-by-frame, the
object changes color from red to green to white. Instead of a smooth trajectory,
the object can be seen to travel in short, discrete steps, with the aforementioned
color changes cycling during each step. The object seems to disappear while
actually moving between each step. As a lifelong supporter of our space
exploration efforts I have observed many hours of NASA footage. Never have
I seen events such as those recorded by STS-48. Lighted objects could most
certainly be debris or ice crystals illuminated by the sun, however, I
can conceive of no possible scenario that could explain the objects that
are travelling in opposite directions. Presumably, thruster plumes should
propel debris in one direction only. Another potential explanation would
be meteor storms or space debris from previous launches. But again, these
explanations cannot account for the observed trajectories . According to
our source, NASA no longer distributes a live downlink from shuttle missions,
instead using a delay similar to that used by talk radio stations to censor
offensive remarks. Sanitizing video downlink from shuttle missions, and
deleting sections of the official archives is not in the interest of the
taxpayers who fund NASA. The need for further official scientific inquiry
is obvious. In the meantime, the anomalous events recorded by Discovery
astronauts during STS-48 can only be classified as UFOs, in the strict
sense of the term. Note: Vince DiPietro's report to FUFOR (the Fund For
UFO Research) provided the descriptions of events for which video was unavailable
to HUFON Report. Interestingly, DiPietro, a NASA employee at the Goddard
Space Flight Center now publicly endorses the &quot;ice crystal&quot; explanation.</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="I"></A>I</P>

<P>Article By Dennis Stacy</P>

<P>Lightning flashed over Corona, New Mexico, and thunder rattled the thin
windowpanes of the small shack where ranch foreman Mac Brazel slept. Brazel
was used to summer thunderstorms, but he was suddenly brought wide awake
by a loud explosion that set the dishes in the kitchen sink dancing. Sonofabitch,
he thought to himself before sinking back to sleep, the sheep will be scattered
halfway between hell and high water come dawn.</P>

<P>In the morning, Brazel rode out on horseback, accompanied by seven-year-old
Timothy Proctor, to survey the damage. According to published accounts,
Brazel and young Proctor stumbled across something unearthly-a field of
tattered debris two to three hundred yards wide stretching some three-quarters
of a mile in length. No rocket scientist, Brazel still realized he had
something strange on his hands-so strange that he decided to haul several
pieces of it into Roswell, some 75 miles distant, a day or two later.</P>

<P>For all its lightness, the debris in Brazel's pickup bed seemed remarkably
durable. Sheriff George Wilcox reportedly took one look at it and called
the military at Roswell Army Air Field, then home to the world's only atomic-bomb
wing. Two officers from the base eventually arrived and agreed to accompany
Brazel back to the debris field.</P>

<P>As a consequence of their investigation, a press release unique in the
history of the American military appeared on the front page of Roswell
DAily Record for July 8, 1947. Authored by public information officer Lt.
Walter Haut and approved by base commander Col. William Blanchard, it admitted
that the many rumors regarding UFOs &quot;became a reality yesterday when
the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force,
Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc
through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's
office of Chaves County.&quot;</P>

<P>Haut's noon press release circled the planet, reprinted in papers as
far abroad as Germany and England, where it was picked up by the prestigious
London Times. UFOs were real! Media calls poured in to the Roswell Daily
Record and the local radio station, which had first broken the news, demanding
additional details.</P>

<P>Four hours later and some 600 miles to the east in Fort Worth, Texas,
Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey, commander of the Eighth Air Force, held a press
conference to answer reporters' questions. Spread on the general's office
floor were lumps of a blackened, rubberlike material and crumpled pieces
of what looked like a flimsy tinfoil kite. Ramey posed for pictures, kneeling
on his carpet with the material, as did Maj. Jesse Marcel, flown in from
Roswell for the occasion. Alas, allowed the general, the Roswell incident
was simple case of mistaken identity; in reality, the so-called recovered
flying disc was nothing more than a weather balloon with an attached radar
reflector.</P>

<P>&quot;Unfortunately, the media bought the Air Force cover-up hook, line,
and sinker,&quot; asserts Stanton Friedman, a nuclear physicist and coauthor
with aviation writer Don Berliner of Crash at Corona, one of three books
written about Roswell. &quot;The weather balloon story went in the next
morning's papers, the phone calls dropped off dramatically, and any chance
of an immediate follow-up was effectively squelched.&quot;</P>

<P>Ramey's impromptu press conference marks the beginning of what Friedman
refers to as a &quot;'Cosmic Watergate,' the ongoing cover-up of the government's
knowledge about extraterrestrial UFOs and their terrestrial activities.&quot;
By contrast, says Friedman, the original Watergate snafu and cover-up pales
in significance. In fact, if Friedman and his cohorts within the UFO community
are correct, military involvement in the recovery of a crashed flying saucer
would rank as the most well-kept and explosive secret in world history.</P>

<P>Of course, not all students of the subject see it that way. &quot;You
have to put Roswell in a certain context,&quot; cautions Curtis Peebles,
an aerospace historian whose treatment of UFOs as an evolving belief system
in Watch the Skies! was just published by the Smithsonian Institute. &quot;And
the relevant context is the role of government and its relationship to
the governed. Americans have always been suspicious, if not actively contemptuous,
of their government. On the other hand, forget what the government says
and look at what it does. Is there any evidence in the historical record
that the Air Force or government behaved as if it actually owned a flying
saucer presumably thousands of years in advance of anything on either the
Soviet or U.S. side? If there, I didn't find it.&quot;</P>

<P>Regardless of its ultimate reality, however, Roswell symbolizes the
difficulties and frustrations Friedman and fellow UFOlogists have encountered
in prying loose what the government does or does not know about UFOs. Memories
fade, documents get lost or misplaced, witnesses die, and others refuse
to speak up, either out of fear of ridicule, or according to Friedman,
because of secrecy oaths. Despite a trail that lay cold for more than 30
years, UFOlogists still consider Roswell one of the most convincing UFO
cases on record. In 1978, for example, Friedman personally interviewed
Maj. Jesse Marcel shortly before his death. &quot;He still didn't know
what the material was,&quot; says Friedman, &quot;except that it was like
nothing he had ever seen before and certainly wasn't from any weather balloon.&quot;
According to what Marcel reportedly told Friedman, in Fact, the featherlight
material couldn't be dented by a sledgehammer or burned by a blowtorch.</P>

<P>Yet getting the Air Force itself to say anything about Roswell in particular
of UFOs in general can be an exercise in futility. Officials are either
bureaucratically vague or maddeningly abrupt. Maj. David Thurston, a Pentagon
spokesperson for the Air Force Office of Public Affairs, could only refer
inquires to the Air Force Historical Research Center in Montgomery, Alabama,
where unit histories are kept on microfilm for public review. But a spokesperson
there said they had no &quot;investigative material&quot; and suggested
checking the National Archives for files from Project Blue Book, the Air
Force's public UFO investigative agency from the late 1940s until its closure
in December of 1969.</P>

<P>Indeed, the dismissive nature with which U.S. officials treated Blue
Book research seemed to indicate they were unimpressed; on that point,
believers and skeptics alike agree. But according to Friedman and colleagues,
that demeanor, and Blue Book itself, was a ruse. Instead far from the eyes
of Blue Book patsies, in top-secret meetings of upper-echelon intelligence
officers from military and civilian agencies alike, UFOs-including real
crashed saucers and the mangled bodies of aliens-were the subject of endless
study and debate. What's more, claims Friedman, proof of this UFO reality
can be found in the classified files of government vaults.</P>

<P>With all this documentation, Friedman might have had a field day. Unfortunately,
researchers had no mechanism for forcing classified documents to the surface
until 1966, when Congress passed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
The FOIA was later amended in the last year of the Nixon administration
(1974) to include the Privacy Act. Now individuals could view their own
files, and some UFOlogists-Friedman included-were surprised to find that
their personal UFO activities had resulted in government dossiers.</P>

<P>Be that as it may, UFOlogists saw the FOIA as a means to an end, and
beginning in the 1970s, their requests and lawsuits started pouring in.
Attorneys for the Connecticut based Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS)
and other UFO activists eventually unleashed a flood tide of previously
classified UFO documents.</P>

<P>In many cases, notes Barry Greenwood, director of research for CAUS
and coauthor with Lawrence Fawcett of The Government UFO Cover-up, most
agencies at first denied they had any such documents in their files. &quot;A
case in point is the CIA,&quot; says Greenwood, &quot;which assured us
that its interest and involvement in UFOs ended in 1953. After a lengthy
lawsuit, the CIA ultimately released more than ten thousand pages of documents
pertaining to UFOs, the overwhelming majority of which were from the CIA,
FBI, Air Force, and various other military agencies. It's safe to say there
are probably that many more we haven't seen.&quot;</P>

<P>As might be expected, the UFO paper trail is a mixed bag. Many of the
documents released are simply sighting reports logged well after the demise
of Blue Book. Others are more tantalizing. A document released by the North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) revealed that several sensitive
military bases scattered from Maine to Montana were temporarily put on
alert status following a series of sightings in October and November of
1975. An Air Force Office of Special Intelligence document reported a landed
light seen near Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the
night of August 8, 1980.</P>

<P>Another warm and still-smoking gun, according to Greenwood, is the so
called Bolender memo, named after its author, Brig. Gen. C. H. Bolender,
then Air Force deputy director of development. Dated October 20, 1969,
it expressly states that &quot;reports of unidentified flying objects which
could affect national security. . .are not part of the Blue Book system.&quot;
Says Greenwood, &quot;I take that to mean that Blue Book was little more
than an exercise in public relations. The really significant reports went
somewhere else. Where did they go? That's what we would like to know.&quot;</P>

<P>Of course there are objections to such a literal interpretation. &quot;As
I understand the context in which it was written,&quot; says Phillip Klass,
a former senior editor with Aviation Week and Space Technology and author
of UFOs: The Public Deceived, &quot;the Bolender memo tried to address
the problem of what would happen with UFO reports of any sort following
the closure of Project Blue Book. Bolender was simply saying that other
channels for such reports, be they incoming Soviet missiles or whatever,
already existed.&quot;</P>

<P>Greenwood counters that the original memo speaks for itself, adding
that &quot;the interesting thing is that sixteen referenced attachments
are presently reported as missing from Air Force files.&quot;</P>

<P>Missing files are one problem. Files known to exists but kept under
wraps, notes Greenwood, are another. To make his point, he cites a case
involving the ultrasecret National Security Agency, or NSA, an acronym
often assumed by insiders to mean &quot;Never Say Anything.&quot; Using
cross references found in CIA and other intelligence-agency papers, CAUS
attorneys filed for the release of all NSA documents pertaining to the
UFO phenomenon. After initial denials, the NSA admitted to the existence
of some 160 such documents but resisted their release on the grounds of
national security.</P>

<P>Federal District Judge Gerhard Gessell upheld the NSA's request for
suppression following a review (judge's chambers only) of the agency's
classified 21-page In Camera petition. &quot;Two years later,&quot; Greenwood
says, &quot;we finally got a copy of the NSA In Camera affidavit. Of 582
lines, 412, or approximately 75 percent, were completely blacked out. The
government can't have it both ways. Either UFOs affect national security
or they don't.&quot;</P>

<P>The NSA's blockage of the CAUS suit only highlights the shortcomings
of the Freedom of Information Act, according to Friedman. &quot;The American
public operates under the illusion that the FOIA is some sort of magical
key that will unlock all the the government's secret vaults,&quot; he says,
&quot;that all you have to do is ask. They also seem to think everything
is in one big computer file somewhere deep in the bowels of the Pentagon,
when nothing could be farther from the truth. Secrecy thrives on compartmentalization.&quot;</P>

<P>In recent years, UFOlogists have found an unusual ally in the person
of Steven Aftergood, an electrical engineer who directs the Project on
Government and Secrecy for the Washington, DC-based Federation of American
Scientists, where most members wouldn't ordinarily give UFOs the time of
day. &quot;Our problem,&quot; says Aftergood, &quot;is with government
secrecy on principle, because it widens the gap between citizens and government,
making it that much more difficult to participate in the democratic process.
It's also antithetical to peer review and cross-fertilization, two natural
processes conducive to the growth of both science and technology. Bureaucratic
secrecy is also prohibitively expensive.&quot;</P>

<P>Aftergood cites some daunting statistics in his favor. Despite campaign
promises by a succession of Democratic and Republican presidential administrations
to make government files more publicly accessible, more than 300 million
documents compiled prior to 1960 in the National Archives alone still await
declassification. Aftergood also points to a 1990 Department of Defense
study, which estimated the cost of protecting industrial-not military-secrets
at almost $14 billion a year. &quot;That's a budget about the size of NASA's,&quot;
he says, adding that &quot;the numbers were ludicrous enough during the
Cold War, but now that the Cold War is supposedly over, they're even more
ludicrous.&quot;</P>

<P>Could the Air Force and other government agencies have their own hidden
agenda for maintaining the reputed Cosmic Watergate? Yes, according to
some pundits who say UFOs may be our own advanced super-top-secret aerial
platforms, not extraterrestrial vehicles from on high. Something of the
sort could be occurring at the supersecret Groom Lake test facility in
Nevada, part of the immense Nellis Air Force Base gunnery range north of
Las Vegas. Aviation buffs believe the Groom Lake runway, one of the world's
longest, could be home to the much-rumored Aurora, reputed to be a hypersonic
Mach-8 spy plane and a replacement for the recently retired SR-71 Blackbird.</P>

<P>In fact, the Air Force routinely denies the existence of Aurora. And
with Blue Book a closed chapter, it no longer has to hold press conferences
to answer reporters' questions about UFOs. From the government's perspective,
the current confusion between terrestrial technology and extraterrestrial
UFOs could be a marriage of both coincidence and convenience. The Air Force
doesn't seem to be taking chances. On September 30 of last year, it initiated
procedures to seize another 3,900 acres adjoining Groom Lake, effectively
sealing off two public viewing sites of a base it refuses to admit exists.</P>

<P>By perpetuating such disinformation, if that is, in fact, what's happening,
the Air Force might be using a page torn from the Soviet Union's Cold War
playbook. James Oberg, a senior space engineer and author of Red Star in
Orbit, a critical analysis of the Soviet space program, has long argued
that Soviet officials remained publicly mum about the widely reported Russian
UFOs in the 1970s and 1980s because such reports masked military operations
conducted at the supersecret Plesetsk Cosmodrome. &quot;Could a similar
scenario occur in this country? It's conceivable,&quot; concedes oberg.
&quot;On the other hand, should our own government take an interest in
UFO reports, especially those that may reflect missile or space technology
from around the world? Sure. I'd be dismayed if we didn't. But does it
follow that alien-acquired technology recovered as Roswell is driving our
own space technology program? I don't see any outstanding evidence for
it.&quot;</P>

<P>Friedman's counterargument is not so much a technological as a political
one. &quot;Governments and nations demand allegiance in order to survive,&quot;
he says. &quot;They don't want us thinking in global terms, as a citizen
of a planet as opposed to a particular political entity, because that would
threaten their very existence. The impact on our collective social, economic,
and religious structures of admitting that we have been contacted by another
intelligent life form would be enormous if not literally catastrophic to
the political powers that be.&quot;</P>

<P>Whatever its reason for holding large numbers of documents and an array
of information close to the vest, there's no doubt that the U.S. government
has been less than forthcoming on the topic of UFOs. Historically, the
government's public attitude toward UFOs has run the gamut of human emotions,
at times confused and dismissive, at others deliberately covert and coy.
On one hand, it claims to have recovered a flying disc; on the other, a
weather balloon. One night UFOs constitute a threat to the national security;
the next they are merely part of a public hysteria based on religious feelings,
fear of technology, mass hypnosis, or whatever the prevailing psychology
of the era will bear. To sort through the layers of confusion spawned by
the governments stance and to reveal informational chasms, whatever the
cause, Omni is launching a series of six continuing articles. In the following
months, we will take the long view, scanning through the history to examine
UFOs under wraps in the decades following Roswell. In the next installment,
look for our report on official efforts to squelch UFO mania and keep tabs
on UFO researchers in the McCarthy-era landscape of the Fifties.</P>

<P>FREEDOM FIGHTERS HANDBOOK: THE OFFICIAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT HOW-TO
FOR INVESTIGATING UFOs</P>

<P>By Paul McCarthy</P>

<P>Many people think the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), passed by Congress
in 1966, gives an American citizen automatic access to any government document.
Not so. UFO researchers have found that it gives them the right to request,
but government agencies retain the right to deny-as they often do.</P>

<P>In fact, applicants find, FOIA requests may be stymied by any number
of exemptions. When information if related to criminal investigations,
pending policy deliberations, national security considerations, or when
it violates an individual's privacy, the FOIA application is denied. The
applicant can appeal, of course, and if he or she loses, may take the case
to federal court-but who has the money? On top of that, FOIA requests are
not a priority with the government, so some agencies have backlogs that
won't be acted upon for years. On other occasions, UFO investigators suspect
their petitions are acted upon too quickly and end up in the circular file.</P>

<P>Yet thousands of pages of UFO documents have been pried loose over the
past 20 years. None clinch the case for a government cover-up of UFO activity,
but they, along with the cross-referencing of other documents and insider
tips, hold out the intriguing possibility that the government is clinging
to hundreds of thousands of pages of files for the diligent or luck to
unearth. Hoping to satisfy our readers' fascination for government secrets
new and old, the following handbook details some of the most tantalizing
FOIA requests and provides tips on tapping the government for more.</P>

<P>YOUR EYES ONLY: OMNI'S TOP TIPS FOR ACCESSING CLASSIFIED MATERIAL ON
UFOs</P>

<P>ON THE DOCKET UFOlogists list the most dramatic attempts to pry loose
documents still marked classified.</P>

<P>The Big Fish. The most important FOIA UFO case ever, according to UFO
researcher Stanton Friedman, was filed in 1979 against the CIA. Citizens
Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS), an Alexandria, Virginia, organization headed
by Larry Byrant, joined with others, including Friedman, to go after all
UFO documents in the possession of the CIA. The CIA responded that it could
do nothing because the documents it had were issued by other agencies and
could only be released by them. Of those, CAUS went after 18 National Security
Agency (NSA) documents, but the NSA would not release them, claiming they
would reveal &quot;sources and methods.&quot; CAUS filed an admini-strative
appeal with the NSA and lost. It then went to federal court, and the judge
ordered NSA to search its files for UFO documents. Surprise: 239 documents
showed up-79 from other unnamed agencies, 23 from the CIA, and 137 unexpected
NSA bonus documents. Still, the NSA refused to release them, and the judge,
after reading the NSA's justification, agreed. Under a later FOIA actions,
the CIA released 9 of its 23 documents, mostly unimportant abstracts of
Eastern European press stories on UFOs. Adding the original 18 NSA documents
that CAUS sought to the newly uncovered batch of 137 shows that the NSA
held on to 155 while the CIA retained 11. In addition, 79 documents from
other agencies never saw the light of day-proof, according to Friedman,
that the government can keep a secret.</P>

<P>Project Moon Dust. Projects Moon Dust and Blue Fly are purportedly efforts
aimed at retrieving manmade space objects that reenter the atmosphere and
crash. Clifford Stone, a retired U.S. Army sergeant with an interest in
UFOs, has been trying to get the military to admit that it runs these projects
and that it also recovers downed UFOs. Stone claims that the 696th Intelligence
Group at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, makes these retrievals, and
he has even submitted an FOIA request for the group's UFO files.</P>

<P>Records from Roswell. The Roswell case, in which a UFO is said to have
crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947, continues to haunt researchers
and to draw numerous FOIA requests. In one of these, Don Schmitt, a researcher
from the Center for UFO Studies in Illinois and coauthor with Kevin Randle
of the 1991 book UFO Crash at Roswell, has filed an FOIA request on behalf
of the family of Mac Brazel, the rancher who found the purported UFO wreckage.
&quot;Specifically, we wanted to see the results of a medical examination
allegedly given to Brazel by the United STates Army after he made his discovery,&quot;
Schmitt explains. &quot;The Army denied that it had records on Brazel of
any soft, even though Brazel served in the Army during WWII.&quot;</P>

<P>Secret Sins. Is there a secrecy oath signed by military personnel involved
with UFOs? Many UFO investigators, including Don Schmitt, claim to have
active-duty and retired military witnesses who will talk privately but
not openly about UFOs and the government for fear of losing pensions. Schmitt
awaits the results of an FOIA request submitted to the Army, Navy, and
Air Force on whether or not an oath of secrecy actually exists.</P>

<P>X Marks the Spot. Another facet of the Roswell case concerns a United
Press International (UPI) reporter who supposedly told Schmitt that in
the early 1960s, a public-information officer (PIO) at Holloman Air Force
Base showed him a map of the Roswell crash site and even drove him out
to look at it. Schmitt's FOIA asks for the name of the PIO and seeks to
learn whether he ever worked with a UPI reporter in the early Sixties.</P>

<P>Name, Rank, and Serial Number. Schmitt would also like to obtain the
records of an ultimately locate 30 military personnel who allegedly worked
at Roswell Air Force Base in 1947. He submitted an FOIA with their names
and serial numbers, asking for access to their complete records. The Air
Force responded that it had no records on those individuals.</P>

<P>Operation Majestic. The MJ-12 documents-short for Operation Majestic-turned
up in microfilm form in the mailbox of Jaime Shadera, a UFO investigator,
back in 1984. Although most UFO researchers now believe the documents are
phony, some say they may be evidence of a top-secret briefing given to
president-elect Dwight Eisenhower in November 1952 by Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter,
then-director of the CIA.</P>

<P>After spending considerable time and money trying to verify these documents,
Stanton Friedman put in an FOIA request in 1989. He thought he could study
the authenticity of the controversial MJ-12 documents by comparing them
to other CIA briefings of like. Friedman learned the times and dates of
these additional briefings in archival research and using that specific
information requested the documents from the CIA. Two years later, the
CIA responded that it could not find any such briefing documents. Friedman
appealed but was told he was number 390 on the list. He is still waiting
for a response.</P>

<P>FOIA Wannabes. Fred Olsen III would like to submit an FOIA request to
the Air Force that asks for the guncamera photos of UFOs that former military
pilots claim were taken during the 1940s and 1950s. Don Schmitt would like
to submit an FOIA request to the Air Force on the contents and purpose
of a mysterious military transport plan said to have departed from Roswell
Air Force Base under tight security on July 9, 1947.</P>

<P>FOIA TIPS</P>

<P>For those sturdy souls who wish to buck the tide, it is sometimes possible
to successfully wield the Freedom of Information Act to dredge up information
buried deep. To help the uninitiated work the system and uncover as much
as possible, FOIA pro Don Schmitt of the Center for UFO Studies provides
three useful tips:</P>

<P>* UFOlogists believe petitions may be screened for buzzwords like UFO,
which tip officials off to give the request prejudicial treatment, so researchers
try to be creative. &quot;We never refer to Roswell by name,&quot; says
Schmitt, &quot;and in the last five years, I have not made an FOIA request
in which I specifically referred to UFOs.&quot; * Schmitt and other FOIA
experts often request paragraphs, even sentences, not in classified documents
just to see whether the agency has any information on the topic at all.
The technique also confuses officials, preventing them from pigeonholing
the request as UFO related, thus encouraging them to give it a higher priority
and push it through. * Hoping to stop the government in efforts to pull
the wool over their eyes, UFO researchers often request documents they
know for a fact exist. &quot;We often try to trip them up,&quot; Schmitt
explains. &quot;We sent in our request; they deny it. Then we send copies
of specific documents that refer to the documents they claim they don't
have.&quot;</P>

<P>SIDE-STEPPING THE FOIA The frustrations of filing an FOIA being what
they are, a number of UFO researchers have now evolved alternative strategies
for prying documents from government vaults. A couple of the most prominent
efforts are detailed below.</P>

<P>MOON DUST II. Cliff Stone's requests to the Air Force and Defense Intelligence
Agency for projects Moon Dust and Blue Fly information were unsuccessful,
so he's making similar requests through the office of Senator Jeff Bingaman
of New Mexico who is working with the Pentagon's Congressional Liaison
Office on this issue. Remember, you are part of a constituency; your representative
can help.</P>

<P>Operation Right to Know. In 1992, Operation Right to Know was formed
by three Mutual UFO Network members who felt political action was the only
way to wrest secrets from the government. They passed out UFO literature
on the ellipse behind the White House in 1992, picketed in front of the
White House in 1993, and demonstrated outside the United Nations building
in New York in November 1993. Operation Right to Know now has more than
200 members, is growing wit European chapters, and will probably picket
for access to government UFO information in a city near you.</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="I.b"></A>I.b</P>

<P>INSIDE THE MILITARY: UFO UNDERGROUND Article by A.J.S. Rayl In 1969,
Project Blue Book-the 16-year U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs-came
to an end, and so did the government's interest in extraterrestrial flying
discs. Of so the American public has been told. In recent years, numerous
individuals and documents from various agencies have emerged from behind
the veil of government secrecy to tell a different story. Their spin: that
while the government officially abandoned all interest in UFOs, a secret
military underground was hot on the trail of suspicious radar blips, saucers,
and even the aliens themselves. What follows are the stories of three individuals-two
of whom come with impressive military credentials; they say they have glimpsed
what seems like evidence of a decades-old cover-up cloaked in the guise
of national security. The third interviewee, a propulsion-system engineer,
claims he was hired by an independent military contractor to study the
innards of an extraterrestrial spacecraft being researched and tested on
the Nellis Air Range in central Nevada.</P>

<P>Omni cannot endorse the veracity of the stories told below. In fact,
we must emphasize that extraordinary tales like these require extraordinary
levels of proof certainly not furnished in our pages, nor, we feel, anywhere
else. That said, we'll get to the fun part. In the pages that follow, you'll
find strange tales of alien intrigue and UFO woe. Decide for yourself:
Are these the ravings of demented hoaxers and madmen or revelations of
truth? Their stories, delivered in dossier format, have been edited from
interviews conducted by author A.J.S. Rayl during the past year.</P>

<P>NATO Meets E.T.</P>

<P>Name: Robert O. Dean, retired Army command sergeant major</P>

<P>Claim: Back in the Sixties, NATO issued a classified report stating
that UFOs were real, of extraterrestrial origin, and had visited the earth.
This extraordinary report was said to come our of NATO's command center,
the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE), located then just
outside of Paris, France.</P>

<P>Background: Dean, a highly decorated veteran, served on the front lines
in both Korea and Vietnam. In 1963, while assigned to the Supreme Headquarters
Operations Center (SHOC), SHAPE's war room, headed up by then-supreme allied
commander of Europe, Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, Dean claims he was able to read
the detailed 12-inch-thick NATO report on UFOs.</P>

<P>The Story: &quot;SHAPE was one of those choice assignments. You had
to have a spotless record and pass security background checks. I applied
on a whim and got it. I was very proud and pleased. At SHAPE, I was put
through more security checks, given a Cosmic Top Secret (yes, this is a
real term) clearance, the highest NATO has, and assigned to the Supreme
Headquarters Operations Center, known as SHOC, the NATO war room. In those
days, the activity would run hot and cold and much of it would depend on
how the Soviets wanted to play it. The most intriguing thing to me was
that we were continually having a problem with large, metallic, circular
objects that would appear over central Europe; these were reported as visual
phenomena by our pilots and appeared on radar as well. Some flew in formation,
and most of the time we spotted them coming out of the Soviet Union, over
East Germany, West Germany, France, and then they would often circle somewhere
over the English Channel and head north, disappearing from NATO radar over
the Norwegian Sea. These objects were very large, moving very fast, at
very high altitudes-higher than we could reach at the time-and they seemed
obviously under intelligent control. &quot;I was told this had been going
on for some time and that in February 1961 there had been quite a scare.
Fifty of these objects were spotted on radar and headed in formation from
the Soviet Union toward Europe, flying at about 100,000 feet. The Soviets
had closed all borders. Everybody went to red alert. All hell broke loose.
We really thought 'The War' had started. We scrambled. We knew the Russians
were scrambling. It was the largest number of these objects that had been
seen. Fortunately -and only by the grace of God-we didn't start bombing
and neither did the Russians. In nine minutes, they were gone.</P>

<P>&quot;I was told that then-Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe,
Sir Thomas Pike, had been repeatedly requesting information from London
and Washington about these objects, but nothing would ever come. We found
out later that the Columbine-Topaz spy ring in Paris was intercepting everything
and forwarding it to the KGB, which often got intelligence information
even before we did. So Pike decided, I was told, to develop an in-house
study to determine whether these objects were a military threat.</P>

<P>&quot;In the meantime, the UFO matter literally brought about the establishment
of direct communication between the East and West in 1962, which I have
always found interesting and ironic. We had pretty well determined by that
time that these were not Russian craft, and the Russians had determined
they were not ours. So, we came to an understanding, and a direct telephone
line was opened between SHOC and the Warsaw Pact Headquarters Command.
Of course, a setup was always a possibility, so we had backup ways of checking
out whether the Russians were being truthful. But since we were both armed
to the teeth and World War III was just ticking away, it was a logical
step in the right direction. That idea developed into the hotline between
the president of the United States and the soviet premier, following the
Cuban Missile Crisis.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, by the time I arrived in 1963, everybody had been talking
about the study, and I had heard the rumors, seen the blips on radar, witnesses
the commotions, and some of us occasionally even talked about the possibilities.
But nothing really prepared me for what I started to read in the early
morning hours one night in January 1964.</P>

<P>&quot;It was about 2:00 a.m. and a relatively quiet night when the SHOC
controller on duty went into the vault and came out with this huge document.
'Take a look at this,' he said. The title was simply Assessment: An Evaluation
of a Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe. It was numbered,
#3, stamped Cosmic Top Secret, had eight inches worth of appendices, dozens
of photographs, and had been signed into the vault by German colonel Heinz
Berger, SHOC's head of security: I quickly learned that it was based on
two and a half years of research, was funded by NATO money, and that only
15 copies were published-in English, German, and French. Each one was numbered.
All were classified and ordered to be kept under lock and key.</P>

<P>&quot;Every time I got the chance, from then until I left, I would read
a section or two in it. It was the most intriguing document I'd ever read.
It was put together by military representatives of every NATO nation and
also included contributions from some of the greatest scientific minds.
These objects were violating all of our known laws of physics, and the
study team had gone to Cambridge, Oxford, the Sorbonne, MIT, and other
major universities for input on chemistry, physics, atmospheric physics,
biology, history, psychology, and even theology, all of which were separate
appendices.</P>

<P>&quot;I read about theories on Einstein's sought-after unified-field
theory, the high radiation at various landing sites, and UFO reports that
dated back to the Roman era and up to our own F105 pilots' sightings and
encounters, and on and on. I had always been a skeptic, but this report,
well . . . it concluded that this stuff was not science fiction.</P>

<P>&quot;I read about contact encounters. One incident that had just happened
in 1963 involved a landing on a Danish farm. According to the report, the
farmer went aboard with the two little beings and two more human-looking
men who spoke to him in Danish. The report included parts of his interrogation
by government authorities and their conclusions that he was telling the
truth. In another incident, according to the reports, a craft landed on
an Italian airfield and offered to take an Italian sergeant for a ride.
He wet his pants-that's what it said-and was so scared, he didn't go.</P>

<P>&quot;The appendix that really got to me was titled 'Autopsies.' I saw
pictures of a 30-meter disc that had crashed in Timmensdorfer, Germany,
near the Baltic Sea in 1961. The British Army, according to the report,
got there first and put up a perimeter. The craft had landed in very soft,
loamy soil near the Russian border and so hadn't destructed, but one-third
of it was buried in. We and the Russians, who also quickly showed up, had
both tracked it.</P>

<P>&quot;inside, there were 12 small bodies, all dead. There were pictures
of the bodies, which looked like the beings known as the 'grays,' being
laid out and then put on stretchers and loaded into jeeps, and autopsy
photos, too. Some of the little grays appeared to not be a reproductive-capable
species. The autopsy guys concluded, according to the report, that it looked
as if they had any system for elimination.</P>

<P>&quot;The craft itself was cut up like a pie into six pieces, put on
lowboys and hauled off. Scuttlebutt was that it was given to the Americans
and flown to Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Ohio. I looked at all these
pictures and couldn't believe it. My skin got cold and I thought, My God.
I had never really believed we were all alone in the universe, but this
was hard to swallow.</P>

<P>&quot;The major conclusions in the NATO report blew me away. There were
five:</P>

<P>1) The planet and human race had been the subject of a detailed survey
of some kind by several different extraterrestrial civilizations, four
of which they had identified visually. One race looked almost indistinguishable
from us. Another resembled humans in height, stature, and structure, but
with a very gray, pasty skin tone. The third race is now popularly known
as the grays, and the fourth was described as reptilian, with vertical
pupils and lizardlike skin.</P>

<P>2) These alien visitations had been going on for a very long time, at
least 200 years-perhaps longer.</P>

<P>3) The extraterestrials did not appear hostile since if that were their
intent they would have already demonstrated their malevolence.</P>

<P>4) UFO appearances and quick disappearances as well as the flybys were
demonstrations conducted on purpose to show us some of their capabilities.</P>

<P>5) A process or program of some soft seemed to be underway since flybys
progressed to landings and eventually contact.</P>

<P>&quot;I wanted so badly to copy this thing. I did take a photograph
of the cover sheet, which wasn't in and of itself classified. But I didn't
want to wind up in Fort Leavenworth. So instead I would go to the bathroom
and take notes-surreptitiously, very carefully.</P>

<P>&quot;I have been through an awful lot in my life, but I've never been
able to just walk away from that report. I know that I'm taking a chance
by violating my oaths. But this is the most important issue of our times-so
dammed important that I can't think of anything more important, and the
public has been deceived and completely kept in the dark about all of this
for all these years. It's the biggest scientific, political scandal ever.
Besides, what have I got to lose? I'm 64 years old now. Are they going
to bump me off? I have told the truth. My integrity and credibility stand.
When is our government going to tell the truth?&quot;</P>

<P>Update: After 27 years of military service, Dean retired and began another
14-year career with the Pima County Sheriff's Department Emergency Services
in Tuscon, Arizona. In 1990, he gave a lecture at the University of Arizona
in which he talked about UFOs. The talk garnered local media coverage.
Afterward, he was denied a promotion at the Sheriff's Department, because,
he alleged, be believed in UFOs. Dean filed suit and won an out-of-court
settlement in March 1992. Now retired, Dean has become a member of several
UFO organizations and has begun giving occasional lectures. He is working
through &quot;any and all legitimate channels&quot; to uncover a copy of
the NATO document and to gather witnesses for an open Congressional hearing
on the subject of UFOs.</P>

<P>Official Response: &quot;Our list of classified documents generated
by SHAPE at that time does not include any with titles similar to that
cited by Mr. Dean,&quot; says Lt. Col. Rainer Otte, German Force, deputy
chief, media section of the public-information office at SHAPE. &quot;Files
on military personnel are in all circumstances kept under national control.
Information on the security clearance that Mr. Dean held may-if ever-only
be released by U.S. authorities.&quot;</P>

<P>The Critics' Corner: &quot;This is a fascinating story, but fantastic
claims like these need more than one man's testimony to be credible,&quot;
says Jerome Clark of the Center for UFO Studies. &quot;Unless independent
verification comes forth, this remains only an intriguing anecdote, not
unlike many others that have circulated since the early UFO era.&quot;</P>

<P>Project Galileo</P>

<P>Name: Bob Lazar, independent contract scientist and businessman</P>

<P>Claim: To have worked as a propulsion-system engineer in late 1988 and
early 1989 on one of nine extraterrestrial spacecraft being researched
and tested on the Nellis Air Range in central Nevada.</P>

<P>Background: From 1982 to 1984, Lazar claims he worked at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico in the Meson Physics lab with a Q-level
security clearance. In 1985, while on vacation in Nevada, he wound up buying
into a legal Reno brothel; the investment proved so profitable that he
didn't have to return to full-time employment for a while. He moved to
Nevada in 1986. In 1988, he wanted to get back into scientific work and
was hired, he says, to work on the top-secret Project Galileo. Lazar passed
a lie-detector test in 1989, arranged by George Knapp, then an anchorman
for KLAS-TV, the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, Nevada, for a special locally
aired series, UFOs: The Best Evidence.</P>

<P>The Story: &quot;In 1988, I decided to reenter the scientific community
and sent resumes to various people. Finally, I interviewed with a placement
firm to work for the Department of Naval Intelligence in a civilian capacity,
and in the fall of 1988, I was hired on an on-call basis to work on a project
involving advanced propulsion systems. At that point, that's all I knew.</P>

<P>&quot;Not long after, I was flown along with several others out to area
51 on the Nellis Air Range. There, we were put on a bus with blacked-out
windows and driven about 15 miles south to the Papoose dry lake bed, bordered
by the Papoose Mountains, where there was an installation they called 'S4.'</P>

<P>&quot;I was introduced to my supervisor and a co-worker and then given
a stack of briefings on various projects, including Project Galileo, which
was devoted to the study of nine disc-shaped extraterrestrial craft that
were somehow acquired by the U.S. government.</P>

<P>&quot;I was assigned back engineering tasks on the reactor and gravity-propulsion
system of one of the discs-essentially to help figure out what made it
work. I don't know whether it was a crash retrieval, although I doubt it,
because the disc didn't appear damaged in any way. In the briefing reports,
there were pictures of several discs along with some of the information
they had already obtained from back engineering research.</P>

<P>&quot;I was stunned and exhilarated at the same time. But there were
well-armed guards everywhere, and this place wasn't exactly the kind of
environment where you could just start asking any and every question you
had. Security, in fact, was oppressive. You were escorted everywhere, even
the bathroom. And if your I.D. badge was just the slightest bit out of
place, you would be tackled by a guard and held with a gun to your head
until your supervisor arrived. And the guards lived for that.</P>

<P>&quot;At times, the whole thing seemed just surreal. There was a poster
of the disc I was working on, which I dubbed the Sport Model, on several
walls. It read, They're here.</P>

<P>&quot;I dealt with only the power sources and propulsion systems on
one of the discs, and I did enter that one disc on several occasions. The
disc was approximately 15 feet tall and about 52 feet in diameter. It had
the appearance of brushed stainless steel or brushed aluminum. I didn't
run a test on it, so I don't know if it was metal, but I did run my hands
down the side of it getting in, and it felt cold, like metal, and it looked
like metal. It had no physical seams, no welds or bolts or rivets, and
it looked as if it were injection molded.</P>

<P>&quot;Inside, there were tiny little seats, much too small to comfortably
handle an average-sized human. I bumped my head on the ends of the craft,
so I concluded that the ceiling curved down to below five feet, 11 inches
inside. There was not a right angle cut anywhere in the craft. Everything
had a smooth curve to it.</P>

<P>&quot;The reactor, which produced anti-matter and then reacted it with
matter in an annihilation reaction, was only about 18 inches in-diameter
and 12 inches tall and was located in the center of the disc. It operated
like a tiny ballet, where everything that happened relied on the effect
before it. The way it accelerated protons inside of it, the was the heat
was converted to electricity, was totally smooth without any wasted heat
or latent energy. It was phenomenal, approaching a 100-percent dynamic
efficiency. Now that seems impossible when you consider the laws of thermodynamics.
All I can say is that this technology is well beyond anything that we now
know with our twentieth century knowledge.</P>

<P>&quot;The reactor is fueled with an element that is not found here on
Earth. Part of my contribution to the program was to find out where this
element plugged into the periodic chart. Well, it didn't plug in anywhere,
so we placed it at an atomic number of 115. It has been theorized for some
time that elements around 113, 114, and 115 may become stable and nonradioactive,
and this is apparently what we were seeing. Element 115 is a stable element,
but one with some interesting properties. It can be used inside the reactor
as a fuel, but also as the source of an energy field accessed and amplified
by the craft's gravity amplifiers. In other words, the craft was both fueled
and propelled by virtue of element 115.</P>

<P>&quot;There was a storage of silver-dollar-sized discs of element 115
from which triangular wedges were cut and put into the reactor. It was
a copper-orange color and extremely heavy. While it was not radioactive,
we assumed it was a toxic material and consequently handled it as such.</P>

<P>&quot;In all the discs at S4, there were three gravity amplifiers positioned
in a triad at the base of the craft. These were the propulsion devices.
Essentially, what they did was amplify gravity waves out of phase with
those of the earth. The craft operated in two modes-omicron and delta,
which indicated how many gravity amplifiers were in use. In the omnicron
configuration, only one amplifier was used; the other two were swung out
of the way and tucked inside the disc. In omnicron mode, the crafts can
essentially rise and hover but do little else. To leave the atmosphere,
however, all three gravity amplifiers have to be powered up and focused
on the desired location. Finally, the crafts do not travel in a linear
mode. Rather, we determined that the discs produced their own gravitational
fields in order to distort time and space and essentially pull their destinations
to them.</P>

<P>&quot;One afternoon, my colleagues and I walked out onto the dry lake
bed. The disc on which we had been working, the Sport Model, had already
been moved out of the hangar and was beginning to lift off. Except for
a slight hissing, it made no noise. It lifted to about 30 feet off the
ground. The hissing stopped, and it just hung silently in the air, moving
to the left, then right. It was absolutely amazing.</P>

<P>&quot;The was information is compartmentalized, that's all the hands-on
information and experience I was allowed to have access to, though we were
given the chance on occasion and only for short periods of time to read
briefing reports that detailed other aspects of this project. The reports
I read that dealt with power and propulsion systems were accurate, and
I proved that to myself by working on the system. Still, I draw a hard
line between what I know to be true and what I read in the other briefing
reports.</P>

<P>&quot;With that understanding, I did read reports about the origin of
this disc. According to one of the briefings, it came from the Zeta Reticuli
star system. Now obviously I didn't fly in a craft or go to that star system,
so I don't really know if it came from there. I didn't speak to any aliens
or see any, so I don't know if they exist or not. That report also said
that contact was made at a certain date; however, all the dates were in
code. Also, according to the report, these beings told our officials that
they had been coming here for 10,000 years, that humans are the product
of externally corrected evolution, and that they were integral to the accelerated
evolution of man.</P>

<P>&quot;My tolerance for the intensive security rapidly diminished. Because
of the 24-hour telephone surveillance, they found out I was having marital
problems and told me the situation had made me a candidate for 'emotional
instability.' They then took my security clearance and told me I could
reapply in six months.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, I knew the test schedule, and I couldn't resist, so one
night I decided to show some friends from a distance what I had been working
on. We all caravaned out into the desert where we watched a test flight.
We got away with it that time, so we started coming back again and again.</P>

<P>&quot;Anyway, the third time we got caught by the Wackenhut Security
guards out on the Bureau of Land Management land that surrounds the range.
They turned me in. Needless to say, officials at Nellis weren't happy.
I went through a debriefing and was threatened at that time. I was scared
and felt that I needed to break away from this before I couldn't.</P>

<P>&quot;Not only did I believe this technology should be given to the
greater scientific community, but I also believed my only protection was
to get the story out. A friend convinced me to talk to George Knapp at
KLAS-TV. I figured if they killed me, then it would simply prove that what
I was saying was true.</P>

<P>&quot;There are many scientists who theorize that there simply cannot
be extraterrestrial discs here, that aliens could not possibly have come
here specifically, because the distance traveled is too great and the energy
required is too awesome, and that there's no relatively quick way to go
that distance even at the speed of light. What I reported is what I experienced,
though in some respects I regret going public. If I had it to do over again,
I might be more inclined to stay on as one of the boys.&quot;</P>

<P>Update: In 1990, after Lazar says he was released from Project Galileo,
he accepted a freelance job setting up a database and surveillance system
for an illegal Las Vegas brothel. That gig eventually garnered him six
felony counts, including aiding and abetting a prostitute, running a house
of prostitution, and living off the earnings of a prostitute. The charges
were quickly dropped to a single felony count of pandering. The one good
thing that came out of the resulting trial, Lazar says, is that he's not
being followed anymore-at least not to his knowledge. &quot;I guess they
figured the pandering conviction discredited me,&quot; he comments.</P>

<P>Lazar currently earns a living from his two small companies, an independent
contracting firm that repairs nuclear devices, and a photo lab. He also
builds and races jetcars. And, every year since 1984, on the weekend before
July 4, he has staged Desert Blast, which he says is the &quot;largest
illegal fireworks show in the West.&quot; This annual pyrotechnic extravaganza
features huge fireworks and assorted gas bombs made by Lazar and friends
as well as jetcar demonstrations and a little semiautomatic weapons venting.
Lazar recently sold his movie rights and is working on a new home video.</P>

<P>Official Response: &quot;The Air Force comment is that there is no comment
on anything that goes on at the Nellis Range,&quot; says Air Force Master
Sgt. J. C. Marcom of Public Affairs. Meanwhile, according to Technical
Sergeant Henderson of Public Affairs, &quot;The Air Force has no record
that Lazar ever worked at Nellis Air Force Base, though we have compiled
an extensive list of inquiries as to his status.&quot;</P>

<P>The Critics Corner: &quot;We've pretty well determined that Lazar did
work at Los Alamos, but it's been impossible to verify exactly what he
did,&quot; says Mark Rodeghier, scientific director of the Center for UFO
Studies. &quot;As for element 115, physicists admit that such an element
is theoretically possible, but we don't know how to manufacture it or where
to get it. So, Lazar's claim to have worked with this element is not necessarily
insane, but it's completely unverifiable. Finally, he seems to know enough
to have really worked at Area 51 or Dreamland where secret aircraft are
tested, but his story remains a murky mystery. The bottom line: It's impossible
to verify. So far, we have not found anyone to corroborate the essentials
of what Lazar says.&quot;</P>

<P>Baffled at Bentwaters</P>

<P>Name: Col. Charles I. Halt, U.S. Air Force, retired</P>

<P>Claim: In late December 1980, while serving as deputy base commander
at Brentwaters Air Base in southern Englant, Halt witnessed and investigated
several anomalous objects in the skies over the Rendelsham Forest, which
separates the American installation from its twin Royal Air Force base,
Woodbridge. The sightings occurred on two separate nights during the week
after Christmas. Two, weeks later, Halt sent a report about the strange
encounters to the British Ministry of Defense.</P>

<P>Background: A career Air Force officer, Halt served in Vietnam and on
various bases before arriving at Bentwaters in 1980. He was promoted to
base commander in 1984. Halt later served as base commander at Kunsan Air
Base, Korea, and as director of the inspections directorate for the Department
of Defense inspector general. He retired in 1991. Halt is the first USAF
officer since Project Blue Book ended to have filed a memo on unidentified
flying objects and gone public with the details.</P>

<P>The Story: &quot;Just after Christmas, about 5:30 a.m., December 26,
1980, I walked into police headquarters and the desk sergeant started to
laugh. He said a couple of the guys had been out chasing UFOs. Nothing,
however, was in the blotter. I told him to put it in.</P>

<P>&quot;When our base commander came in, we both chuckled. Neither of
us believed in UFOs, be we did decide to look into it. Before we had the
chance, two nights later, the duty flight commander for the security police
unit rushed in to a belated Christmas party white as a sheet. 'The UFO
is back,' he said.</P>

<P>&quot;I was asked to investigate. I changed into a utility uniform,
then headed out in a jeep to the edge of the forest. About a dozen of our
men were already there. Out light-alls (large gas-powered lights) wouldn't
work, and there was so much static and constant interference on our radios
that we had to set up a relay. There was increasing commotion. I was determined
to show them this was nonsense.</P>

<P>&quot;I took half a dozen of the men and headed into the woods on foot
to a clearing where the initial incident had supposedly taken place. We
found three distinct indentations in the ground equidistant apart and pressed
well into the sandy soil. They were supposedly cause by the object seen
two nights before, but I didn't see anything sitting there that night.
Neither did anybody else there.</P>

<P>&quot;Inside the triangular area formed by the indentations, one of
the men got slightly higher readings on the Geiger counter than he did
outside. He photographed the area, and I took a soil sample. Meanwhile,
I recorded this activity on my microcassette recorder.</P>

<P>&quot;We knew the Orford Ness lighthouse beacon beamed from the southeast.
All of a sudden, directly to the east, we saw an unusual red, sunlike light
oval shaped, glowing, with a black center-10 to 15 feet off the ground,
moving through the trees. Beyond the clearing was a barbed-wire fence,
farmer's field, house, and barn. The animals were making a lot of noise.</P>

<P>&quot;We ran toward the light up to the fense. It shot over the field
and then moved in a 20-to 30-degree horizontal arc. Strangely, it appeared
to be dripping what looked like molten steel out of a crucible, as if gravity
were somehow pulling it down. Suddenly, it exploded-not a loud bang, just
boomph-and broke into five white objects that scattered in the sky. Everything
except our radios seemed to return to normal.</P>

<P>&quot;We went to the end of the farmer's property to get a different
perspective. In the north, maybe 20 degrees off the horizon, we saw three
white objects-elliptical, like a quarter moon but a little larger-with
blue, greed, and red lights on them, making sharp, angular movements. The
objects eventually turned from elliptical to round.</P>

<P>&quot;I called the command post, asked them to call Easter Radar, responsible
for air defense of that sector. Twice they reported that they did'nt see
anything.</P>

<P>&quot;Suddenly, from the south, a different glowing object moved towards
us at a high rate of speed, came withing several hundred feet, and then
stopped. A pencillike beam, six to eight inches in diameter, shot from
this thing right down by our feet. Seconds later, the object rose and disappeared.</P>

<P>&quot;The objects in the north were still dancing in the sky. After
an hour or so, I finally made the call to go in. We left those things out
there.</P>

<P>&quot;The film turned out to be fogged; nothing came out. But a staff
sergeant later made plaster castings of the indentations, and I had the
soil sample.</P>

<P>&quot;Around New Year's Eve, I took statements and interviewed the men
who had taken part in the initial incident. The reports were nearly identical.</P>

<P>&quot;Basically, they reported this: In the early morning hours of December
26, one of the airmen drove to the back gate at Woodbridge on a routine
security check. He saw lights in the forest, specifically a red light,
and thought maybe an airplane had crashed. He radioed a report, which was
called into the tower, but the tower reported nobody was flying.</P>

<P>&quot;Eventually, a group headed out to the forest. They reported strange
noises-animals, movement, like we heard two nights later.</P>

<P>&quot;As they approached the clearing, they reported seeing a large
yellowish white light with a blinking red light on the upper center portion
and a steady blue light emanating from underneath. The tower again reported
nothing on radar.</P>

<P>&quot;A few of the men moved to within 20 or 30 feet. Each said the
same thing independently-a triangular shaped metallic object, about nine
feet across the base, six feet high, appeared to be sitting on a tripod.
They split up, walked around the craft. One of the men apparently tried
to get on the craft, but, they said, it levitated up.</P>

<P>&quot;All three of the guys hit the ground as the craft moved quickly
in a zigzagging manner through the woods towared the field, hitting some
trees on the way. They got up and approached again, but the object rose
up, and then it disappeared at gerat speed.</P>

<P>&quot;Finally, on January 13, 1981, I wrote a memo to the British Ministry
of Defense. Despite my efforts, to my knowledge, no one from any intelligence
or government agency ever came on base to investigate.</P>

<P>&quot;I have never sought the limelight, nor have I hidden. I stand
to receive no financial benifit from this interview but consented becase
it's time the truth came out. I don't know what those objects were. I don't
know anybody who does. But something as yet unexplained happened out there.&quot;</P>

<P>Update: In 1983, a copy of Halt's memo to the British MOD was released
through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Shortly thereafter, a copy
of the 18-minute audiotape of the investigation Halt conducted was given
to a British UFOlogists by, Halt says, another Air Force Officer. Both
have made the rounds within the UFO community.</P>

<P>As a result, Halt says he has been &quot;harassed&quot; by UFOlogists
and fanatics. While half a dozen men assisted Halt's investigation and
dozens of others were near the scene, only a handful of witnesses have
come forward. At leat one of them, Halt says, is spreading disinformation;
consquently, media coverage has been inaccurate at best. For instance,
he says, &quot;The stories about holographiclike aliens emerging from their
craft are pure fiction.&quot;</P>

<P>Official Response: &quot;The Air Force stopped investigating UFOs in
1969 when Project Blue Book was completed,&quot; says Air Force spokesman
Maj. Dave Thurston, based in Washintgon, D.C.</P>

<P>The Critics' Corner: &quot;The UFO you hear described on the audiotape
was almost certainly the lighthouse beacon in my opinion, becase the peak
interval between their descriptions of it getting brighter, then dimmer,
is the time of rotation of the beacon, which was about ten miles away,&quot;
says UFO skeptic Philip Klass. &quot;Even though they said they saw numerous
lights in the night sky, one of ever three UFOs reported turns out to be
a bright celestial body.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bentwaters is a case of magical thinking-a situation where a bunch
of people got excited about different things they correlated in their mind,&quot;
says UFO investigator James McGaha, technical consultant to the Committee
for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and a retired
Air Force Pilot, who traveled to England, surveyed the area, and interviewed
various people. &quot;Consider these facts: On the night of December 25
to 26, at 9:10 p.m., Russian satellite Cosmos 746 reentered the atmosphere
over England and appeared as a bright object. At 2:50 a.m., a fireball
entered the atmosphere over Woodbridge. At 4:11 a.m., a British police
car with a blue strobe light on top and other lights attached to the undercarriage
responded to a telephone report and was driving on the dirt roads through
the forest.</P>

<P>&quot;Halt's memo reports that on the second night, they saw two objects
in the north, one in the south. On that night, three of the brightest stars
were visible-vega and Deneb in the north, Sirius in the south. And clearly,
the strange red light mentioned on the audio tape is the Orford Ness Lighthouse
beacon. Beyond that, the morning after the first night, British officers
identified the indentations as rabbit diggings. The Geiger counter readings
were of background radiation. Nothing appeared on radar that night, either,
and no one in either base tower reported anything unusual. Furthermore,
no civilians reported seeing or hearing anything.&quot;</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="I.c"></A>I.c The Great High-Rise Abduction</P>

<P>Whatever spin you put on it, it's definitely the case of the century</P>

<P>It was cold and clear, about 3:00 a.m., when the car stalled near the
South Street seaport in Manhattan. Glimpsing up, the passengers-a major
political figure, who will remain unnamed, and two government agents-spied
a glowing oval object hovering over a building a couple of blocks away.
As lights on the heavenly vision changed from red-orange to a bright bluish-white,
a woman in a nightgown floated off a twelfth story window and hovered midair.
The awe-struck witnesses watched as the woman, surrounded by several small
creatures, ascended effortlessly into the bottom of the craft. The object
zipped over the Brooklyn Bridge and finally plunged into the East River.
Or so the story goes.</P>

<P>&quot;It's an extraordinary case,&quot; says Budd Hopkins, a world-class
modern artist who has recently become known for his books, Missing Time
and Intruders, detailing his 18 years of investigation into claims that
thousands of people have been abducted by UFOs. A trip to Hopkins' studio
on Manhattan's West Side reveals the profound influence these so-called
abductions have had on his art. Scattered around the room are colorful,
profile-shaped paintings he calls &quot;guardians&quot; that evoke nothing
if not the aliens in question. Indeed, as Hopkins describes his work, his
dark, thick eyebrows dance with enthusiasm; these days, it is the bizarre
tales of UFOs and the nasty creatures who inhabit them, plucking innocents
from their homes in the middle of the night, that consume most of his time.</P>

<P>If Hopkins seems excited, he explains, it's because he has found a case
that might convince the army of skeptics who have hounded him for years.
Unlike the thousands of other abduction cases on record, he explains, this
is the first time independent witnesses have come forward claiming to have
seen the event take place. Even more significant, one of these witnesses
is said, in the vernacular, to be a Very Import Person. &quot;The implication,&quot;
Hopkins speculates, &quot;is that this was deliberate, a demonstration
of alien power and intent.&quot;</P>

<P>Hopkins has never had trouble drawing dramatic conclusions about UFO
abductions, a phenomenon that emerged, it should be noted, without him.
The first bizarre story came to public attention in 1966 and involved the
now-notorious New England couple, Betty and Barney Hill. Under hypnosis,
the Hills recalled being snatched from their car and examined by small
creatures aboard a flying saucer. But it would take another decade, a few
more headline-grabbing abduction tales, and, finally, the television broadcast
of the Hills' own story before tales of alien encounters became embedded
in the popular consciousness at large.</P>

<P>The stage was now set for Hopkins to emerge as the leading authority
on abductions. It happened in 1981 with the publication of his book, Missing
Time, in which he suggested that the abduction experience was much more
widespread than anyone had imagined. For Hopkins, the plight of the abductee
became a personal crusade, and before long, he would be lecturing on the
subject across the country, appearing on one talk show after another, and
finally writing Intruders, a 1987 best seller that was turned into a television
mini series in 1992. Clearly, no one has done more than Hopkins to bring
this strange phenomenon to public awareness. Even more to the point, no
one has had greater success in getting scientists and mental-health professionals
to take a serious look at abductions.</P>

<P>So it's no surprise that when Hopkins began touting his latest case
as the strongest evidence yet for UFOs, their alien occupants, and their
systematic abduction of human beings, people listened. But as the pieces
of the puzzle were revealed, critics began charging that rather than prove
his point, Hopkins had fallen victim to the elaborate fantasy of a bored
housewife or a complex hoax. Indeed, said his detractors, so outrageous
was the tale and so fragile the evidence for it, it had backfired, destroying
his credibility and bringing down his body of work like a house of cards.</P>

<P>The story certainly is a humdinger, with more twists and turns than
California's Highway 1 and more mystery characters than a Le Carre spy
thriller. &quot;It's a crazy, endless saga,&quot; says Hopkins, including
such elements as secret agents, attempted murder, and two high-level political
figures, Mikhail Gorbachev one of them.</P>

<P>The central character in the case is Linda. She does not want her last
name revealed. She lives in Lower Manhattan, and on the very hot spring
day I went to meet her, I came to appreciate why the aliens had decided
to grab her through the windows. It certainly beats penetrating a locked
gate and the scrutiny of a guard, then taking an elevator up 12 stories
and winding your way through a corridor to her place. When I knocked on
the door, I was greeted by an attractive, fortyish woman with brown, almond-shaped
eyes and long, flowing brown hair. We sat down on her couch, and as her
air conditioner blasted arctic air and she smoked a dozen cigarettes, I
was treated to one mind-boggling tale.</P>

<P>It started early in 1988. Linda had just bought Kitty Kelly's biography
of Frank Sinatra and another book, which she took to be a mystery. The
other book was Intruders by Budd Hopkins. By the end of the first chapter,
she was stumped: Aliens had left mysterious implants in people's brains
and noses, and that last little bit bothered her. Thirteen years before,
she had found a lump on the side of her nose and had gone to a specialist
who said it was built up cartilage left over from a surgical scar. But
she had never had any such surgery, even as a child, she said. Linda then
took my finger and put it on her nose: Yes, I could feel a very slight
bump on her upper right nostril. But there had to be more than this, I
thought. There was.</P>

<P>A year later, Linda finally contacted Hopkins, who decided to explore
Linda's past with his favorite tool-hypnosis. &quot;It felt kind of strange,&quot;
Linda says. &quot;I'm just a wife and mother. I'm just Linda. UFOs? Naw.&quot;</P>

<P>Hopkins says he learned otherwise. He regressed Linda to age 8, enabling
her to recall an episode in which she thought she glimpsed the cartoon
character Casper, of Casper the Friendly Ghost fame. But under hypnosis,
her memory of Casper turned out to be a large, top shaped object that she'd
seen flying above the apartment building across the street from her childhood
home in Manhattan. Hopkins came to suspect that she had been abducted by
aliens and by June of 1989 had invited her to join his support group for
abductees.</P>

<P>&quot;I remember sitting there bug-eyed listening to these people,&quot;
says Linda. &quot;I felt strange the first time, but after that I felt
better.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Finally, on November 30, 1989, a very agitated Linda called Hopkins
to report she had been abducted again. She had gone to bed quite late,
at about ten minuets before 3:00 a.m., because she'd been up doing the
laundry. Towels and blue jeans for four take eons to dry in her small dryer,
she explained. Her husband, who normally worked nights, was on jury duty
that week and so was home and asleep in the bedroom. She showered, got
into bed, and lying on her back, clasped her hands and began reciting &quot;Our
Father&quot; to herself, a habit she carried over into adulthood from her
Roman Catholic upbringing. Then she felt a presence in the room.</P>

<P>&quot;I was awake but had my eyes closed,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I
was afraid. I knew it wasn't my husband; he was snoring away. Then I lay
there wondering Did I lock the door? Is it one of the kids?&quot; She called
out the names of her two boys and finally reached out for her husband.
&quot;Wake up,&quot; she said, &quot;there's somebody in the room.&quot;</P>

<P>He didn't answer, and she began to feel a numbness crawl up from her
toes. After months in the support group exploring her past abductions,
she recognized what that meant. It's now or never, she thought and opened
her eyes. At the foot of the bed, says Linda, stood a small creature with
a large head and huge black eyes. &quot;I screamed and yelled,&quot; she
says, &quot;and then threw my pillow. The creature fell back.&quot; After
that, she has only fragments of conscious memory-a white fabric going over
her eyes; little alien hands pounding up and down her back; suddenly falling
back into bed.</P>

<P>It was a quarter to 5:00 in the morning when Linda jumped out of bed,
ran into the kids' room, and discovered, she says, that &quot;they weren't
breathing.&quot; Hysterical, she retrieved a small mirror from the bathroom
and placed it under their noses. Suddenly, a mist formed on the mirror,
she says, and she heard her husband snoring in the other room. They were
all alive. Linda, in shock, sat on the floor in the hallway between the
two bedrooms until dawn. Later she called Hopkins.</P>

<P>Under hypnosis, Linda revealed that there had actually been five creatures
in the apartment. They had led her form the bedroom through the living
room and out a closed window, she declared, where, floating in midair,
she saw a bright bluish-white light. She was afraid of falling and embarrassed,
thinking her nightgown had gone over her head. She moved up into the craft
and then found herself sitting on a table. The creatures around her, she
says, were scraping her arms-&quot;like taking skin samples,&quot; she
speculates, and pounding with an instrument up and down her spine-all typical
abduction fare, to say the least.</P>

<P>Quite atypical is what allegedly happened 15 months later. In February
1991, Hopkins received a typewritten letter from two people claiming to
be police officers. Late in 1989, the letter said, the two had witnessed
a &quot;little girl or woman wearing a full white nightgown&quot; floating
out of a twelfth-floor apartment window, escorted by three &quot;ugly but
small humanlike creatures&quot; into a very large hovering oval that eventually
turned reddish orange. The object, the letter added, flew over their heads,
over the Brooklyn Bridge, and plunged into the East River. They wondered
if the woman was alive, though they wished to remain anonymous to protect
their careers. They signed the letter with first names only-Richard and
Dan.</P>

<P>Hopkins was astonished. &quot;I realized immediately that the woman
they had seen was Linda,&quot; he said. &quot;The account seemed to corroborate
the time, date, and details of her abduction. Here, finally, were independent,
seemingly reputable witnesses to an abduction.:</P>

<P>When Hopkins first called Linda to tell her, she replied, &quot;That
can't be possible.&quot; Then she wondered if she and Budd were the victims
of a cruel joke. But all suspicions vanished one evening a few weeks later,
she says, when Richard and Dan showed up at her door.</P>

<P>&quot;Police,&quot; they announced. Linda looked through the peephole
and saw two men in plain clothes flashing a gold badge. &quot;So I let
them in,&quot; said Linda, &quot;and they looked at me kind of funny. When
they introduced themselves as Dan and Richard, my stomach dropped to the
floor.&quot; Both were tall, well-built, attractive men in their forties,
she says. Dan sat on the couch, put his head in his hand, and said, &quot;My
God, it's really her.&quot; Richard had tears in his eyes and hugged her,
expressing relief that she was alive.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Budd had warned me not to discuss the incident with anyone,&quot;
Linda says now, &quot;so all I could do was tell them to talk to Budd.&quot;</P>

<P>In the year that followed, Linda claims, she had numerous encounters
with the mystery due-at the bus stops, outside her dentist's office, even
at church. Hopkins himself never had the pleasure of meeting the pair,
though, he says, he did eventually receive three more letters from Dan
and four letters and an audiocassette from Richard. In one letter, says
Hopkins, Dan explained his need to remain anonymous: He and Richard were
not New York City cops, he said, nor on that fateful November night had
they been alone. They were, in fact, government security agents and had
been escorting an important political figure, who they would not name,
to a downtown heliport; suddenly their car's engine died and the headlights
went out. They had seen Linda's abduction unfold after they pushed the
car to safety under the elevated FDR Drive.</P>

<P>Dan and Richard just couldn't stay away. One morning, after Linda had
walked her youngest son to the school bus at 7:15, she claims she was approached
by Richard, who asked her to take a ride in his car. She refused, but Richard's
grip firmed on her shoulder. &quot;You can go quietly or you can go kicking
and screaming,&quot; Linda claims Richard told her. As he dragged her to
the open rear door of his black Mercedes, he tickled her, Linda states.
&quot;That's how he got me in the car.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;They drove me around for about three hours,&quot; says Linda,
&quot;asking me all sorts of questions.&quot; Did she work for the government?
Was she herself an alien? They even demanded she prove herself human by
taking off her shoes. Aliens, they would claim in a letter to Hopkins,
lacked toes. She called Hopkins as soon as they dropped her off at home.</P>

<P>&quot;Hopkins told me to call the police,&quot; Linda now explains,
&quot;but I refused. Who would have believed me?&quot; The notion of surveillance
by Richard and Dan eventually spooked her so much that she quit her secretarial
job and simply stayed home. To ease Linda's isolation, Hopkins found a
benefactor who paid for Linda's limited use of a bodyguard so she could
go out.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the bodyguard was not around for what Linda says was
her second major encounter with Richard and Dan. On October 15, 1991, Linda
reports, Dan accosted her on the street and pulled her into a red Jaguar.
As they drove along, he sometimes put his hand on her knee-&quot;to distract
me,&quot; Linda suggests, &quot;from following the rout to a three-story
beach house which I assume was on Long Island.&quot; Inside, Dan started
a pot of coffee and gave Linda a present: a nightgown, she says, &quot;the
kind a woman might wear if she didn't have any children, especially sons.&quot;
Dan asked her to put it on so he could photograph her in it as she appeared
mid-abduction, floating over New York. She refused but finally agreed to
put it on over her clothes. As Dan's behavior became increasingly strange,
she decided to flee, running out the door and onto the beach.</P>

<P>&quot;Dan caught me and picked me up, shaking me like a toy,&quot; she
says. There was mud on my face, so he dunked me in the water once, twice,
three times. I don't think he was trying to drown me, but he kept me under
too long.&quot; This behavior, which critics of this strange tale have
termed &quot;attempted murder,&quot; finally ceased. Instead, Dan pulled
off Linda's wet jeans and she says, pulled her down on his lap in the water,
rocking her like a baby. Shortly after, Linda reports, &quot;Richard showed
up, apologized for Dan, and drove me home.&quot;</P>

<P>Linda went straight to Hopkins. &quot;She left sand all over my house,&quot;
Hopkins says. &quot;A few weeks later, I received a half dozen photographs
of Linda, in the nightgown, running along the beach.&quot;</P>

<P>That November, the saga became stranger still. While lunching with Linda,
a relative who was also a doctor insisted she go to the hospital to x-ray
the lump in her nose. The x-ray Linda now presents shows a profile of her
head; clearly visible is a quarter-inch-long cylinder apparently embedded
in her nose.</P>

<P>&quot;It was weird,&quot; says Hopkins' friend Paul Cooper, professor
of neurosurgery at New York University, who has examined the x-ray. &quot;I've
never seen anything like it.&quot; But even Cooper admits the x-ray could
have been faked by taping a little something to the outside of Linda's
nose.</P>

<P>Moreover, as usually happens in UFO stories, this tantalizing bit of
evidence vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Soon after getting the
x-ray, Linda told Hopkins she'd awakened with a bloody nose. Under hypnosis,
Hopkins says, Linda revealed that the aliens had again whisked her away.
Later, with Cooper's help, Hopkins had further x-rays taken, but the implant
was nowhere to be seen.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, another alleged witness to Linda's spectacular abduction
came forward. That same month, Hopkins received a large manila envelope
from a woman living in upstate New York. On the outside, in large letters,
appeared the words, Confidential, Re: Brooklyn Bridge.</P>

<P>On the evening of November 29, 1989, the woman-Hopkins calls her &quot;Janet
Kimble&quot;-Had been in Brooklyn at a retirement party for her boss. When
she headed home via the Brooklyn Bridge around 3:00 a.m., she told Hopkins,
her car came to a dead stop in the middle of the bridge and her headlights
blinked out. The same thing, she states, happened to the cars coming up
behind her. Suddenly, she saw what she thought was &quot;a building on
fire&quot; about a quarter of a mile away. The light was so bright that
she had to shield her eyes, she said. Then she realized what she was seeing:
Four &quot;balls&quot; had floated out of an apartment window and, midair,
unfolded into three &quot;rickets-stricken&quot; children and a fourth,
taller, &quot;normal girl-child&quot; wearing a white gown. &quot;While
I watched,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I could hear the screams of people parked
in their cars behind me.&quot; The &quot;children&quot; were then whisked
up into the object, whereupon it flew over the Brooklyn Bridge and disappeared
when her view was obscured by a walkway.</P>

<P>Hopkins says he telephoned &quot;Janet Kimble&quot; immediately and
later had lunch with her. The tale told by this &quot;widow of about sixty
who once worked as a telephone operator&quot; corroborates stories told
by Richard and Linda, he says, ruling out the possibility of a hoax.</P>

<P>In fact, if Hopkins is to be believed, another witness to the Linda
abduction was actually the first. That person, he states, is a UFO abductee
as well, a woman in her early thirties who claims to have been abducted
from her Manhattan bedroom in the middle of the night. She consciously
remembers being outside at some point, moving along the streets involuntarily,
and seeing 15 to 20 other women all moving zombielike toward a UFO on the
banks of the East River.</P>

<P>When Hopkins tells me this, I can't help but guffaw. He finds my reaction
perfectly understandable. &quot;What can I say?&quot; he says. For Hopkins,
who is in the midst of investigating another mass abduction in New York
City involving a hundred humans, this woman's story is only &quot;a little
more bizarre than most.&quot;</P>

<P>In any event, says Hopkins, this woman at one point looks down the East
River and sees two other UFOs in the sky, one a bright orange object at
the southern end of Manhattan, ostensibly the one that abducted Linda.</P>

<P>The two cases, if believed and taken in concert, shed an ominous light
on the humorous name that some critics have bestowed on the Linda case:
&quot;Manhattan Transfer.&quot; Were the aliens out that night abducting
Manhattanites like Linda in droves?</P>

<P>By December of 1991, the end of Linda's saga was nowhere in sight. She
was now struggling with an obviously disturbed an persistent human named
Dan, who, according to Richard had been admitted to a &quot;rest home.&quot;
At Christmas, she received a card and note from Dan. It was a love letter
actually. He told her he planned to leave the &quot;rest home&quot; soon
and asked her to pack her toothbrush-he was coming for her. He wanted to
learn her alien ways and her special language. &quot;You'll make a beautiful
bride,&quot; he teased. Linda, however was not amused.</P>

<P>Dan apparently tried to get Linda in February of 1992, but she was rescued
from this dragon by Richard, who Linda now regards as a knight in shining
armor. Linda says that Richard, up on returning from a &quot;mission&quot;
abroad, had gone to visit Dan at the rest home, found him missing, and
had come looking for him in New York. When he learned that Dan had prepared
a passport for Linda and booked two tickets to England, he immediately
sought out Linda and managed to sweep her away just in time.</P>

<P>Linda's last contact with the aliens occurred a few months afterward.
On Memorial Day 1992, she, her husband, two sons, and one of their guests
all awakened at about 4:30 in the morning with nosebleeds. Hopkins says
he has subsequently confirmed, through hypnosis, that the incident was
UFO related. &quot;I really don't try to convince anybody,&quot; says Linda,
having come to the end of her story. &quot;I don't expect anyone to believe
this because, to tell you the truth, if the shoe were on the other foot,
I wouldn't believe it either. But it happened. It happened.&quot;</P>

<P>If it really did, I thought, the independent witnesses would confirm
it. The prize witness obviously was the VIP, and the word in the UFO community
is that Hopkins thinks it was Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general
of the United Nations from 1982 to 1991. &quot;I will not deny or confirm
that,&quot; says Hopkins. &quot;I won't say who he is, but I can say this:
All the letters from Richard and Dan refer to the fact that there was a
third man in the car. And he's written one letter to me, which was signed,
The Third Man. I can't make the things he said public, though clearly he's
letting me know between the lines who he is.&quot;</P>

<P>Actually, rumor has it that this third party may be central to the Linda
case. According to anonymous sources close to Hopkins, Richard, Dan, and
their passenger were all abducted on that fateful day of November 30, 1989,
right along with Linda. Their delayed recall of this event supposedly would
explain why it took them 15 months for them to write to Hopkins, why they
were so interested in Linda, and why they are so reluctant to come forward
now.</P>

<P>But all that is certain about Perez de Cullar is that he was in New
York City on the days in question. Did he really witness the Linda abduction?</P>

<P>Joe Sills, spokesman for the secretary-general at the United Nations,
was nice enough to check with the security people but came up empty handed.
&quot;No one that I spoke to,&quot; he says, &quot;was aware of him ever
being in that part of town at that hour of the morning. It's just not in
the kind of schedule he kept.&quot; What's more, he added, Perez de Cuellar
could not have been heading for the heliport since he always went to the
airport via limousine. U.N. spokesperson Juan Carlos Brandt checked with
Perez de Cuellar directly. &quot;He says he never witnessed any incident,&quot;
says Brandt.</P>

<P>And adding insult to injury, Hopkins can't even prove that the two government
security agents, Richard and Dan, are real. He has never met or spoken
to them, and all efforts to identify them have proven fruitless. In March
of 1991, for instance, Linda looked through six hours of clips of news
programs showing security agents at events in New York City. The clips
belong to one of Hopkins' contacts in the government law enforcement. Near
the end of the six hours Linda spotted a man whom she identified as 'Dan.'
Despite the fact that the images were taken from a distance, involved crowds
and the bustling chaos that accompanies visiting dignitaries, she apparently
had no trouble making her identification. Those who have viewed the tapes
have seen a man who appears to be taking part in official business, and
who is in no way out of place or unusual.</P>

<P>In the months that followed, Hopkins and Linda made the rounds with
their pictures of &quot;Dan&quot; in hand. They went to United Nations
security and the State Department, Secret Service, and Russian delegation
offices in New York. At times, Hopkins and Linda would use a cover story
so as not to arouse suspicion: &quot;Sometimes we said we were husband
and wife and that this was a friend we had met a couple of years ago in
Cape Cod and he had said to look him up here when we came to New York,&quot;
Hopkins explains. But the ploy didn't work. &quot;I've been all over with
these pictures,&quot; says Hopkins, &quot;and nobody recognizes him.&quot;</P>

<P>Then there is the woman on the bridge, &quot;Janet Kimble.&quot; She
is a real person but apparently, after being ridiculed by her own family,
wants no part of Hopkins' story. When Hopkins tried to arrange an interview
for me, she told him, &quot;I can't help you anymore with this.&quot; The
final independent witness is the woman up the East River who claims to
have participated in the mass abduction of women that very night. But she's
another abductee and not truly impartial in the matter.</P>

<P>With no independent witnesses willing to come forward, the case, not
surprisingly, has come under intense criticism. Curiously, two of those
most critical of the case initially became involved at Linda's request.</P>

<P>By early 1992, Linda was feeling so helpless at the hands of her human
kidnappers that she decided to seek additional expert help. At the suggestion
of New York journalist and UFO researcher Antonio Huneeus, she contacted
Richard Butler, a former law-enforcement and security specialist for the
Air Force and a fellow abductee, whom Linda had met at Hopkins' support
group. Butler met with Linda on February 1, 1992, and brought with him
Joe Stefula, a former special agent for the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigations
Command and current head of security for a drug company in New Jersey.
During the meeting, Linda asked for safety tips on how to protect herself
from the dangerous duo, and Butler and Stefula, in order to give useful
advice, asked Linda a few questions of their own.</P>

<P>Several months later, after Hopkins made the case public at the 1992
Mutual UFO Network annual meeting in Albuquerque, Stefula, Butler, and
a friend of theirs, parapsychologist George Hansen, decided the case needed
a thorough investigation and began poking around Linda's neighborhood.
They spoke to the security guard and supervisor at Linda's building, went
to the offices of the New York Post nearby, and simply interviewed residents
to see if they remembered anything amiss. No one did.</P>

<P>Afterward, Hansen, already the author of a number of stinging critiques
of both psi research and its critics, wrote a lengthy skeptical report.
The central issue, say the skeptics, is the lack of large numbers of witnesses
to this spectacular event. After all, New York never sleeps; there are
people out and about even in the middle of the night. Why did none of the
truck drivers at the loading dock of the New York Post just a short distance
from Linda's apartment see this blindingly bright object? Why haven't all
those other people whose cars were supposedly stalled on the Brooklyn Bridge
come forward?</P>

<P>To such questions, Hopkins has a two-fold reply: &quot;The unwillingness
of people to report such fantastic experiences is not new. People do not
like to be ridiculed,&quot; he says. Then there's the invisibility issue,
&quot;which just seems to be part of the phenomenon. Many people who you
think should have seen these things just don't,&quot; Hopkins explains.</P>

<P>But Hopkins can't explain everything. For instance, how could &quot;Janet
Kimble&quot; know that the words Brooklyn Bridge written on the outside
of her envelope would attract Hopkins' attention unless she knew or was
related to one of the the people in the Hopkins support group, all of whom
had heard about the case? The answer, replies Hopkins, is ridiculously
simple: &quot;She saw the abduction from the Brooklyn Bridge and thought
that the others who had been stalled on the bridge that night might have
contacted me about it.&quot;</P>

<P>But Butler says the likelier explanation is that Linda fabricated the
whole story after reading Nighteyes, a science-fiction novel by Garfield
Reeves-Stevens published in April of 1989, just months before her alleged
abduction. The novel charts the abductions of an FBI team staking out a
beach house in California while a mother and daughter undergo a series
of abductions in and around New York City. It concludes with an apocalyptic
finale. Butler claims that Linda was very intrigued when the book was brought
up at the Hopkins support-group meetings. &quot;I guarantee you that's
where she got the basis for her story,&quot; he says.</P>

<P>Butler admits the book's storyline is different from Linda's but says
there are too many parallels to be coincidence. Both Linda and the novel's
Sarah were abducted into a UFO hovering over a high-rise apartment building
in New York City. Linda was kidnapped and thrown into a car by Richard
and Dan; one of the novel's central characters, Wendy, was kidnapped and
thrown into a van by two mystery men. Dan is supposed to be a security
and intelligence agent, while one of the book's central characters is an
FBI agent. Both Dan and an agent in the novel were hospitalized for emotional
trauma. Both Linda and the novel's Wendy were taken to a &quot;safe house&quot;
on the beach. The list of such parallels goes on and on.</P>

<P>&quot;But similarity does not prove relationship,&quot; replies Hopkins.
Without an important political figure witnessing the abduction-the very
essence of the Linda case, he notes-the comparison with the book is meaningless.</P>

<P>Hopkins is not alone. Walt Andrus, international director of the Mutual
UFO Network (MUFON, is &quot;absolutely convinced the case is authentic.&quot;
And David Jacobs, a history professor at Temple University and another
researcher on the abduction scene, says the critics debunking the case
have twisted the facts. &quot;Over the past several years, I have been
a confidant of Hopkins' and, at times, of Linda's. I can tell you that
when Hopkins' report comes out, the inaccuracy of the critics will be apparent
and the case will stand or fall on its own merits.&quot;</P>

<P>For Hansen, of course, those merits are slim. And, he says, the hoaxing
he believes occurred is the least of it. &quot;For me,&quot; he says, &quot;the
worst infraction is the reaction of the leadership of UFOlogy. I think
this has given us great insight into the mentality-and the gullibility-of
Budd Hopkins, Walt Andrus, and David Jacobs, the people who really control
much of what people actually read about UFOs.&quot;</P>

<P>Hansen is particularly upset that, given charges of kidnapping and attempted
murder, the leadership did not go to the police. &quot;I recognize there
is government cover-up on UFOs,&quot; he says, &quot;but covering up a
so-called attempted murder and kidnapping, as these guys apparently say
they've done-that's quite something else.&quot;</P>

<P>Hoping to right the wrong, Hansen has, in fact, sent a letter to the
inspector general's office, Department of the Treasury, requesting that
Linda's claims of kidnapping and attempted murder by federal agents be
investigated. In February of 1992, the SEcret Service contacted Linda and
she and Hopkins went down to their World Trade Center offices to speak
to Special Agent Peggy Fleming and her supervisor. Hopkins and Linda told
Fleming the story and explained that they didn't know who Hanson was or
why he was involved. Linda also objected to what she perceived as Hansen's
insinuation that she was against the government. She was not, she said:
&quot;I'm a Bush Republican.&quot;</P>

<P>When I called the Secret Service about their investigation, I was referred
to Special Agent James Kaiser, media representative in the New York field
office. After reviewing the file on the case, titled &quot;Special Agent
Alleged Misconduct, February 10, 1993,&quot; Kaiser told me that Linda
&quot;was, in fact, interviewed at our office, and it was determined that
her allegations regarding U.S. Secret Service agents having any contact
with her whatsoever prior to that day were unfounded and baseless. It never
happened. She may have been mistaking us for some other agency or organization.
Case closed.&quot;</P>

<P>The case is also closed as far as Hansen, Stefula, and Butler are concerned.
They truly believe that Linda is involved in a hoax. &quot;I think she
started out with a small lie,&quot; speculates Hansen, &quot;a tall tale
that grew in the three years that followed. She's been a typist and temporary
secretary, so she has had access to a lot of different typewriters undoubtedly.
It would not surprise me if there were someone else hoaxing Hopkins as
well.&quot;</P>

<P>Hopkins flatly rejects the hoax scenario. &quot;An efficient hoax has
a minimum of moving parts,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't want to go into
too many details. This has more moving parts that one could possibly imagine.&quot;</P>

<P>As for Linda, when asked if she had made up this whole scenario, she
replied simply, &quot;No. How could this be a hoax? There are too many
people involved. In fact,&quot; she added, &quot;I take the suggestion
as a compliment. They must think I'm pretty intelligent to pull off such
a thing.&quot;</P>

<P>Some details of the case frankly do make me suspicious. For one, the
drawings of the abduction that Hopkins received from Richard and the woman
on the bridge not only look like they might have been prepared by the same
person, despite the stylistic and perspective differences, which Hopkins
has duly noted, but more importantly, both were done in crayons and used
the same colors.</P>

<P>What's more, to actually meet Linda and hear her talk is to be transported
to a world where reality is inverted, where all we have ever known is flipped
on its head. Strain your ears, and you can almost hear the chords from
Twilight Zone kick in as the underlying chaos of the universe takes control.
Fact is, outrageous as I find Linda's story, Linda herself seems sincere.
Her emotions-fright, anxiety, and anger-appear genuine.</P>

<P>I'm not alone in these impressions. John Mack, a professor of psychiatry
at Harvard University MEdical School, whom Hopkins confided in as the story
unfolded and who know knows Linda well, insists that &quot;there is nothing
unauthentic or devious&quot; about her.</P>

<P>Gibbs Williams, a New York psychoanalytic psychotherapist with a quarter
century of experience, has tested Linda and also dismisses any notion that
Linda might be hoaxing the whole affair. &quot;You would have to have the
kind of conspiratorial mentality of Richard Nixon and be able to think
sixty-two moves ahead,&quot; Williams says. &quot;Quite frankly, Linda
doesn't appear to have that kind of mind; she does not have that kind of
abstracting capacity.&quot; He notes further that her emotive capacity-her
anger, crying, and tendency to get carried away-is not consistent with
the psychopathic cool mentality of the hoaxer and liar. &quot;My conclusion,&quot;
he says, &quot;is that from her perspective, she is telling her truth.&quot;</P>

<P>Perhaps Jerome Clark, vice president for the Center for UFO Studies
(CUFOS) and editor of the International UFO Reporter, sums up the controversy
best: &quot;This is an absolutely extraordinary claim, and the evidence
that you need to marshal to support such a claim simply is not there.&quot;</P>

<P>Hopkins promises it will be when his book appears. Until then, Linda
stands alone, ambivalent about her fame. On the one hand, she seems to
revel in the notoriety. She attends national UFO meetings obviously dressed
to impress. &quot;To tell you the truth, it wouldn't be that bad if I didn't
have a family,&quot; she admits to me.</P>

<P>Yet she also feels victimized. &quot;There are a lot of Italian Americans
and Chinese in my neighborhood, and many of them even laugh at joggers,&quot;
she says. &quot;Imagine if anyone in the area herd that I was abducted
by aliens.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Worst of all,&quot; she continues, &quot;those critics took away
the safety of my family by taking my real name and publishing it. We are
sitting ducks for any crackpot int he UFO community. They know where I
live. They know what I look like.&quot; She has already taken her name
off her intercom system, and she fully expects to move when Hopkins' book
on the case comes out. &quot;I don't know what's worse,&quot; she says
finally, &quot;what Richard and Dan did, what these three stooges from
New Jersey did, or what the aliens did.&quot; Or what Hopkins has done,
I might add. After all, he promised so much and has delivered so little.
Poor Linda. *END*</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="I.d"></A>I.d SOVIET SAUCERS</P>

<P>by James Oberg</P>

<P>[ The P/\NTHER - This guy is a suspected CIA disinformant and I have
seen him appear in numerous UFO specials/documentaries with different credentials
each time...This is the guy who said the 1991 Space Shuttle UFO footage
was 'SPACE ICE'... Beware!]</P>

<P>Day after day, the waves of UFOs returned to southern Russia. Cossacks
on horseback saw them high in the evening sky. Pilots aboard commercial
airliners and military interceptors chased and dodged them. Astronomers
at observatories in the Caucasus Mountains noted their crescent shape and
their fiery companions.</P>

<P>It was the fall of 1967, and the Soviet Union was in the grip of its
first major UFO flap. The extraordinary tales, described on Soviet television,
reported in Soviet newspaper, and analyzed in a private nationwide UFO
study group soon took on a life of their own.</P>

<P>In one detailed account, an airliner crew from Voroshilovgrad to Volgograd,
flight 104, insisted that a UFO had hovered and then maneuvered around
their plane. According to Soviet UFO enthusiast Felix Zigel, who compiled
such accounts, the plane's engines died and did not start up again until
after the UFO had disappeared, when the aircraft was only a half mile high
in the air.</P>

<P>These tales and others were repeated in Western UFO books and presented
as important evidence at UFO hearings in the United States Congress and
in Britain's House of Lords. Then, as suddenly as it had started, the wave
of Russian UFO sightings ceased. Private UFO groups were banned by the
Soviet government, and the subject was dropped from the controlled media
even as it spread wildly in the samizdat, the underground Russian press.</P>

<P>But the phenomenon was not forgotten. Years later, astronomer Lev Gindilis
and a team of investigators from the Academy of Sciences in Moscow assessed
Zigel's UFO files, analyzing statistics from what they said was &quot;the
repetitive motion&quot; of the objects Ziegel described. In 1979, the &quot;Gindilis
Report&quot; was released and distributed around the world. It concluded
that no known natural or manmade stimulus could account for these &quot;anomalous
atmospheric phenomena.&quot; Something truly extraordinary and truly alien
must have occurred.</P>

<P>But it was too good to be true. Like many other official Soviet government
reports, the Gindilis Report turned out to be counterfeit science. In effect,
and probably in intent, it served to cover up one of Moscow's greatest
military secrets, an illegal space-to-earth nuclear weapon.</P>

<P>What the witnesses really saw back in those exciting days in 1967 were
space vehicles all right, but not from some distant, alien world. They
were Russian missile warheads, placed in low orbit under false registration
names and then diverted back toward the planet's surface after one circuit
of the globe. As they fireballed down toward a target zone near the lower
Volga River, they seared their way into the imaginations of startled witnesses
for hundreds of miles in all directions.</P>

<P>Of course, U.S. intelligence agencies had also been watching the tests,
and they weren't fooled by the UFO smokescreen. Pentagon experts soon dubbed
this fearsome new weapon a &quot;fractional orbit bombardment system,&quot;
or FOBS. Government spokespeople in Washington denounced it as a first
strike weapon designed to evade defensive radars. Since Moscow had recently
signed a solemn international treaty forbidding the orbiting of nuclear
weapons, the existence of this weapon (whose tests alone did not violate
the treaty) was a glaring advertisement of contempt. So when Russian UFO
witnesses concluded that they had been seeing alien spaceships instead
of treaty-busting weapons tests, Soviet military officials were all too
willing to permit this illusion to prosper.</P>

<P>Twenty-five years later, with the FOBS rockets long since scrapped and
the Soviet regime itself on the scrap heap of history, the now-purposeless
deception has maintained a zombielike life of its own. Russian UFO literature
continues to issue ever more glorious accounts of the 1967 &quot;crescent
spaceships.&quot; Mainstream Russian magazines, newspapers, and even museum
exhibits contain fanciful drawings of such shapes. Zigel himself is revered
as &quot;the father of Soviet UFOlogy,&quot; an icon of reliability and
authenticity.</P>

<P>But Zigel's and Gindilis's crescent craft are just one example of the
ridiculous notions and outrageous fictions Russian UFOlogy has spawned.
In 1977, for instance, Tass, the official Russian new agency, carried a
dispatch from the northwest Russian port city of Petrozavodsk titled &quot;Strange
Natural Phenomenon over Kerelia.&quot; Wrote local correspondent Nikolay
Milov, &quot;On September 20 at about 0400 a huge star suddenly flared
up in the dark sky, impulsively sending shafts of light to the earth. This
star moved slowly toward Petrozavodsk and, spreading out over it in the
form of a jellyfish, hung there, showering the city with a multitude of
very fine rays which created an image of pouring rain.&quot;</P>

<P>The &quot;visitation&quot; unleashed a torrent of rumors. People later
reported being awakened from deep sleep by telepathic messages. Tiny holes
were reportedly seen in windows and paving stones. Cars were said to have
stalled and computers to have crashed, and witnesses smelled ozone.</P>

<P>Soviet UFO enthusiasts rushed to embrace the case. &quot;As far as I
am concerned,&quot; claimed science-fiction author Aleksandr Kazantsev,
&quot;it was a spaceship from outer space, carrying out reconnaissance.&quot;
According to Dr. Vladimir Azhazha, &quot;In my opinion, what was seen over
Petrozavodsk was either a UFO, a carrier of high intelligence with crew
and passengers, or it was a field of energy created by such a UFO.&quot;
Zigel, the dean of Soviet UFOlogists, agreed it was a true UFO: &quot;Without
a doubt-it had all the features.&quot;</P>

<P>Sadly, the cause of all this mindless panic was a routine rocket launching
from the supersecret military space center at Plesetsk in northwest Russia.
The multiengined booster's contrails, backlit by the dawn sun, seemed to
split into multiple glowing tentacles.</P>

<P>In 1981, a midnight rocket launch from Plesetsk lit up the skies of
Moscow itself and sent the capital city's residents into a blitz of unconstrained
creativity. UFO expert Sergey Bozhich's notebooks contain reports of numerous
&quot;independent&quot; UFO encounters during this ordinary launching.
&quot;Pilots of six civil aircraft reported either a UFO in flight or a
UFO [attacking] their aircraft,&quot; he wrote. &quot;At 1:30 a UFO attacked
a truck along the Ryazan Avenue in Moscow.&quot; One witness even reported
walking from a deep sleep to see a &quot;scout ship&quot; with a glass
cupola and small alien pilot cruising down his street.</P>

<P>The pattern is clear. Time and again, secret launchings or Russian rockets
have unleashed avalanches of classic UFO perceptions from the imaginative,
excitable witnesses and their careless interviewers. And consistent with
its origins, Russian UFO literature is still characterized by fantastic
tales and an utter lack of research into possible explanations. &quot;I
have no doubts&quot; is the most common figure of speech in the lexicon
of Russian UFOlogists, and they are doubtlessly sincere, if arguably deluded.
&quot;Are UFOs real?&quot; one was asked not long ago by American documentary
filmmaker Bryan Gresh. &quot;My colleagues and I don't even think that's
a question,&quot; he responded. &quot;Of course they are real!&quot;</P>

<P>This sort of quasi-religious fervor just helps to fuel the skepticism
of the cautious observer. After all, if Russian UFOlogists cannot or will
not recognize the prosaic stimulus behind these phony crescent UFOs of
1967 and the UFO &quot;jellyfish&quot; of 1977, they may be incapable of
solving any of the other hundreds of ordinary (if rare) causes that account
for at least 90 percent (if not 100 percent) of all UFO perceptions. Dozens
of major stimuli, and hundreds of minor ones, are constantly giving rise
to counterfeit UFO perceptions around the world. Filtering out the residue
of true UFOs from the pseudo UFOs poses enormous challenges for investigators.
Most Russian UFOlogists appear unwilling to face this challenge.</P>

<P>And the writings of prominent Russian UFO experts give ample ground
for more anxiety. Vladimir Azhazha, probably the leading Russian UFO expert
of the 1990s, is an undeniable enthusiast of UFO miracle stories. Some
years ago, his favorite Western UFO story involved a UFO attack on the
Apollo 13 space capsule, which he &quot;disclosed&quot; was carrying a
secret atomic bomb to create seismic waves on the moon.</P>

<P>But it was carrying no such thing. The April 1970 explosion, which disabled
the craft and threatened the lives of the three astronauts, was caused
by a hardware malfunction. When challenged recently by UFOlogists Antonio
Huneeus, Azhazha made a candid admission: &quot;When I gave the lecture,
I was a teenager in UFOlogy and was intoxicated by the E.T. hypothesis
and did not recognize anything else. I would retell with pleasure everything
I read.&quot;</P>

<P>Supposedly reformed, Azhazha then published a new book with a glorious
new Apollo astronaut UFO story based this time on forged photographs published
in American tabloid newspapers. The pictures show contrast-enhanced fuzzballs,
photographic images that had been sharpened in the photo lab. A fabricated
&quot;radio conversation&quot; in which the astronauts exclaim surprise
at seeing alien spaceships in a crater near their landing site later appeared
in another tabloid; it was patently bogus, too, based on grossly misused
space jargon. The story was long ago abandoned by reputable Western UFOlogists,
but Azhazha still loves it and presents it as true.</P>

<P>At a UFO conference in Albuquerque in 1992, Azhazha told astonished
Western colleagues that he had proof that 5,000 Russians had been abducted
by UFOs and never returned to Earth. When asked to defend this number,
he disclosed that he took the reported number of ordinary &quot;missing
persons&quot; in the entire Soviet Union, plotted the regions over which
major UFO activity had been reported, and then allocated those population
proportions of &quot;missing&quot; to the UFOs. It was simple, sincere,
and senseless, but the embarrassed American hosts (who had paid his travel
expenses) couldn't disagree too publicly lest their waste of money be obvious.</P>

<P>Russian UFOlogists claim to be careful. Azhazha himself has written:
&quot;NOthing on faith! One must check, check, and eleven times check in
order to find an error!&quot; But he doesn't seem to know how, and neither
do any of his colleagues. While their sincerity and enthusiasm are not
in doubt, their judgement, balance, and accuracy should be.</P>

<P>Why are people like Azhazha the best that Russia can offer? Russians
are heirs to a great, creative civilization, but they are also emerging
from a social era that has had profound effects on their habits of thought.
Today's Russians have lived in a reality-deprived and judgement-atrophied
culture for generations. Once they were sufficiently brain be numbed by
a repressive communist regime to accept any and all propagandistic idiocies
fed to them, they were intellectually defenseless against infections of
other brain bunk as well.</P>

<P>UFO enthusiasm prospers in this nurturing environment. And it's not
just UFO sightings that get conjured up by this fuzzy thinking. Historical
figures, preferably dead ones who cannot disagree, are now constantly being
portrayed as &quot;secret UFO believers.&quot;</P>

<P>For example, in 1993, a slick new UFO magazine called AURA-Z appeared
in Moscow. Continuing the trend of tying now-dead space heroes to UFO studies,
the magazine featured two separate interviews with contemporary experts
concerning the role played by Sergey Korolev, the founder of the Soviet
missile and space programs. It didn't bother the magazine at all that the
two stories were utterly inconsistent.</P>

<P>In one article, rocket expert Valery Burdakov presented a detailed account
of how back in 1947 Stalin had ordered Korolev to assess Soviet intelligence
reports on the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO crash. Korolev had reported back
that the UFOs were real but not dangerous, the article &quot;revealed.&quot;
Yet just seven pages earlier, another expert named Lev Chulkov had written:
&quot;As early as the beginning of the 1950s, Stalin ordered Korolev to
study the phenomenon of UFOs, but Korolev managed to avoid fulfilling this
task.&quot; Of course, both claims can't be true. Besides, Burdakov was
a recently rehabilitated political prisoner in 1947 and was thus hardly
the type of trusted expert that Stalin would have consulted.</P>

<P>Behind all such distracting noise, the UFO problem remains a fascinating
and elusive puzzle, worthy of serious research. But weeding out true UFOs
from the overwhelming mass of &quot;IFOs,&quot; or identified flying objects,
is a difficult, time-consuming task, as Western UFOlogists have learned
in the past half century. Their new Russian colleagues so far show no indication
that they have even begun.</P>

<P>&quot;I haven't seen too much effort at that job,&quot; admits Antonio
Huneeus, one of the West's most perceptive pro-UFO observers of Russian
UFOlogy. &quot;The Russians themselves keep knocking on my door,&quot;
Huneeus states. &quot;They want to sell their stuff here.&quot; In fact,
given today's economic crisis in Russia, thousands of people of all classes,
but particularly from the military services, are desperately seeking-or
deliberately creating-anything they can sell to Western buyers with bucks.
UFO files are one of the few exportable raw materials with a market in
the West, so there should be no surprise that there are suddenly so many
bizarre items now available and so few Russians willing to be cautious
or critical about them.</P>

<P>If these Russian UFO delusions only affected their own research, the
silliness would do no worldwide harm. But the intellectual infection has
spread far beyond borders and polluted UFO studies in other countries as
well. These new commercial conspiracies between Russian tall-tale sellers
and Western tall-tale tellers in the entertainment and pseudodocumentary
industry will make it much worse.</P>

<P>The more serious Western UFOlogists, for instance, are particularly
embarrassed by their colleagues' naive, unbounded enthusiasm for the 1967
&quot;crescents&quot; and the subsequent so-called Gindilis Report, with
Soviet thermonuclear weapons tests masquerading as true UFOs. Dr. James
McDonald, probably America's top UFO expert of the 1960s, testified that
the crescents &quot;can not be readily explained in any conventional terms.&quot;
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, dean of American UFOlogy in the 1970s, reviewed the
sightings and crowed, &quot;It becomes very much harder-in fact, from my
personal viewpoint, impossible-to find a trivial solution for all the UFO
reports if one weights and considers the caliber of some of the witnesses.&quot;
They were scientists, pilots, engineers, and fellow astronomers, and Hynek
as absolutely certain they couldn't have been mistaken.</P>

<P>Today's successor to McDonald and Hynek is retired space scientist Richard
Haines, American director of the joint United States-Commonwealth of independent
States working group on UFOs, the Aerial Anomaly Federation. Concerning
the 1967 sightings, he confidently wrote that &quot;the reports represent
currently unknown phenomena, being completely different in nature from
known atmospheric optics effects or technical experiments in the atmosphere.&quot;</P>

<P>Another famous Russian pseudo UFO case, called the &quot;Cape Kamenny
UFO,&quot; has long been foolishly championed by Western UFO experts. Top
American UFOlogist Jacques Valle cited this encounter in a 1992 book as
one of the best in the world. His casebook coding scheme gave it the highest
marks: &quot;Firsthand personal interview with the witness by a source
of proven reliability; site visited by a skilled analyst; and no explanation
possible, given the evidence.&quot;</P>

<P>A graphic account of this UFO was given by American UFOlogist William
L. Moore based on casebooks compiled by Zigel. &quot;On December 3, 1967
at 3:04p.m.,&quot; wrote Moore, several crewmen and passengers of an IL-18
aircraft on a test flight for the State Scientific Institute of Civil Aviation
sited an intensely bright object approaching them in the night sky.&quot;
Moore reported that the object &quot;followed&quot; the evasive turns of
the aircraft.</P>

<P>But years later I discovered that the aircraft, passing near Vorkuta
in the northern Urals, had by chance been crossing the flight path of the
Kosmos-194 spy satellite during its ascent from Plesetsk. The crew had
unwittingly observed the rocket's plumes and the separation of its strap-on
boosters. All other details of maneuvers were added in by their imaginations.
Yet this bogus UFO story is highlighted as authentic by nearly every Western
account of Russian UFOs in the last 20 years.</P>

<P>Of course, not all Russian UFO reports spring from missile and space
events. Far from it! But those specific kinds of stimuli are extremely
well documented, unlike other traditional pseudo UFO stimuli such as balloons,
experimental aircraft, military and police helicopters, bodice fireballs,
and so forth. Thus, they can provide an unmatchable calibration test for
the ability of Russian UFOlogists to find solutions for these pseudo UFOs.</P>

<P>The Russian UFOlogists have failed. The ultimate test of the Russians'
ability to perform mature, reliable UFO research is how they treat &quot;the
smoking gun&quot; of Russian UFOlogy, the Petrozavodsk &quot;jellyfish&quot;
UFO of 1977. The &quot;jellyfish&quot; was a brief wonder in the West before
being quickly solved (by me) as the launch of a rocket from Plesetsk. Western
UFOlogists readily accepted the explanation, but now it turns out that
Russian UFO experts never did. They have assembled a vast array of miracle
stories associated with the event, including reports of telepathic messages
and physical damage to the earth.</P>

<P>But all this proves is that ordinary Russians love to embellish stories
and that Russian UFO researchers haven't a clue on how to filter out such
exaggerations from original perceptions. If they cannot do it for such
obviously bogus UFOs as Petrozavodsk, how can they be expected to do it
for less clearcut ones?</P>

<P>If the UFO mystery is to be solved, there is adequate data from the
rest of the world outside of Russia. Serious UFOlogists will have to quarantine
the obviously hopelessly infected UFO lore from Russia and disregard it
all. Some valuable data might be lost, but the crippling effect of unconstrained
crackpottery would be avoided. Every decade or two, the question can be
reconsidered with a simple test: Do leading Russian UFOlogists still insist
on the alien nature of the 1967 crescent UFOs and the 1977 &quot;jellyfish&quot;
UFO? If so, slam the door on them again.</P>

<P>Yet the temptation may be too great, especially for those who are into
what I call the &quot;fairy tale mode&quot; of modern UFO study-those who
believe the best cases are ones that happened long ago and far away, and
thus are forever immune from prosaic solution. Russian UFO stories have
turned out to be exactly those kinds of fairy tales.</P>

<P>And if the purpose of modern UFOlogy is only mystery worship and obfuscation,
only mind-boggling tall tales and mind-stretching theorizing, then it will
continue to feed on the baseless bilge coming out of Russia while being
insidiously and unavoidable poisoned by it. The reality test, then, is
not of Russian UFOlogy, which has already failed, but of non-Russian UFOlogy,
where the issue remains in doubt.</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="II"></A>II</P>

<P>Article by Dennis Stacy</P>

<P>Editor's note (OMNI Mag.): This is the second of a six-part series ivestigating
UFOs and government secrecy through the years. The decade under scrutiny
here is the 1950s.</P>

<P>Shortly before midnight of July 19, 1952, air-traffic controllers at
Washington National Airport picked up a group of unidentified flying objects
on their radar screens. Over the next three and a half hours, the targets
would disappear and reappear on their scopes. They were visually corroborated
by incoming flight crews. At 3:00 in the morning, the Air Defense Command
dispatched two F-94 jet interceptors, which failed to make contact with
the targets.</P>

<P>The following weekend, the same scenario virtually repeated itself.
Unknown targets were picked up on radar and verified both by incoming pilots
and ground observers. This time, the hurriedly scrambled jets did manage
to make visual contact and establish a brief radar lock-on, and the general
public joined in the hoopla as well. According to The UFO Controversy in
America, by Temple University historian David Jacobs, &quot;So many calls
came into the Pentagon alone that its telephone circuits were completely
tied up with UFO inquiries for the next few days.&quot; In several major
newspapers, the 1952 UFO flap even bumped the Democratic National Convention
off the front-page-headlines.</P>

<P>The so-called &quot;Washington Wave&quot; also resulted in at least
two events that have been debated ever since. On July 29, in an attempt
to quell public concern, the military held its largest press conference
since the end of WWII. Press conference heads Maj. Gen. John Samford, director
of Air Force Intelligence, adn Maj. Gen. Roger Ramey, chief of the Air
Defense Command, denied that any interceptors had been scrambled and attributed
the radar returns to temperature inversions.</P>

<P>In addition, the Washington sightings led directly to the CIA-sponsored
Robertson Panel, so named after its chairman Dr. Harold P. Robertson, director
of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group for the secretary of defense. The
Panel's basic mandate was outlined in a document later retrieved under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</P>

<P>In that crucial document, a 1952 memorandum to the National Security
Council (NSC), CIA director Walter Bedell Smith wrote that &quot;a broader,
coordinated effort should be initiated to develop a firm scientific understanding
of the several phenomena which are apparently involved in these reports,
and to assure outselves that [they] will not hamber our present efforts
in the Cold War or confuse our early warning system in case of an attack.&quot;</P>

<P>In line with this mandate, the panel that finally convened in Washington,
DC, in mid January of 1953 consisted of some of the best scientific minds
of the day. Members included a future Nobel Prize laureate in physics,
Luis Alvarez, formerly of Berkeley; physicist Samuel Goudsmit of the Brookhaven
National Laboratories; and astronomer Thornton Page of Johns Hopkins University,
later with NASA&gt;</P>

<P>Yet for all of its scientific expertise, the Panel's major recommendations
fell mainly in the domain of public policy. After a review of the evidence,
the Panel concluded that while UFOs themselves did not necessarily &quot;constitute
a direct threat to the national security. . . the continued emphasis on
the reporting of these phenomena does [threaten] the orderly functioning
of the protective organs of the body politic.&quot;</P>

<P>Panel members recommended that &quot;national-security agencies take
steps immediately to strip the UFO phenomenon of its special status and
eliminate the aura of mystery it has acquired.&quot; Perhaps a public-education
program with the dual goals of &quot;training and debunking&quot; could
be implemented? In this context, the Panel suggested that the mass media
might be brought to bear on the problem, up to and including Walt Disney
Productions!</P>

<P>More interestingly, the Panel also recommended that pro-UFO grassroots
organizations be actively monitored &quot;because of thei r potentially
great influence on mass thinking if widespread sightings should occur.&quot;
Mentioned by name were two organizations that had arisen in the wake of
the Washington Wave: Civilian Saucer Intelligence of Los Angeles and the
Aerial Phenomena Research Organization of Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, both
now defunct.</P>

<P>Is there evidence that such surveillance was conducted or that the Robertson
Panel recommendations influenced government policies? &quot;The paper trail
is sketchy at best,&quot; says Dale Goudie, a Seattle advertising agent
and information director for the Computerized UFO Network, or CUFON, an
electronic bulletin board specializing in UFO documents retrieved under
the FOIA. &quot;What we know is that some agencies tend to keep some old
UFO files while throwing out or mysteriously losing others. For example,
we know the FBI kept a file on George Adamski, a famous UFO 'contactee'
of the Fifties, perhaps because they thought he was a communist, and that
the CIA had communicated with Maj. Donald Keyhoe, later one of the directors
of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.</P>

<P>&quot;When it comes to their own programs, however, the agencies are
a bit more absent-minded.&quot; An example, says Goudie, Project Aquarius.
&quot;The National Security Agency [NSA] admitted in a letter to Senator
John Glenn that apparently there is or was an Air Force Project Aquarius
that dealt with UFOs,&quot; Goudie states. &quot;Their own Project Aquarius,
they said, did not, but they refused to say what it did deal with. They
did admit it was classified top secret and that the release of any documents
would damage the national security. The Air Force denies the existence
of their own Project Aquarius, and the NSA now says it was mistaken. They
ought to get their stories straight.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's almost impossible to confirm that any individual action was
directly dictated by the Robertson Panel,&quot; agrees physicist and UFOlogist
Stanton Friedman, co-author of Crash at Corona, &quot;but was the subject
defused at every available opportunity per its recommendations? You bet!&quot;</P>

<P>Friedman points specifically to a press release issued on October 25,
1955, by the Department of Defense, chaired by secretary of the Air Force
Donald Quarles. The occasion was the release of Special Report 14, issued
by Project Blue Book, the Air Force agency publicly charged with investigating
UFOs. Quarles said there was no reason to believe that any UFO had ever
overflown the United States and that the 3 percent of unknowns reported
the previous year could probably be identified with more information.</P>

<P>As Friedman sees it, however, Special Report 14 was the best UFO study
ever conducted. Interpreting the report for Omni, Friedman says it showed
that &quot;over 20 percent of all UFO sightings investigated between 1947
and 1952 were unknowns, and the better the quality of the sighting, the
more likely it was to be an unknown. The press release failed to mention
any of the 240 charts and tables in the original study,&quot; adds Friedman,
&quot;nor did it point out that the work had been done by the highly respected
Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the Department of Air Force.
It's a classic case,&quot; Friedman says, &quot;of the government having
two hands and the left one not knowning what the right one is up to.&quot;</P>

<P>Whatever the truth about UFOs, however, the government tried mightily
to conceal information suggesting mysterious origins afoot. For a population
already shaky over nuclear arsenals, cold war, and communists under ever
bush, officials may have reckoned that the notion of visitors from beyond,
even imaginary ones, might just have been too much to bear.</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="III"></A>III</P>

<P>Article by DENNIS STACY</P>

<P>The third in a six-part series on government suppression of UFO-related
material, this article examines the 1960s.</P>

<P>The Sixties were marked by upheaval: street riots outside the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, demonstrations against the war in Vietnam,
&quot;free love,&quot; and psychedelic drugs. And according to pundits,
a &quot;Big Brother&quot; government intent on suppressing the winds of
change had extended its reach beyond the merely social or political to
the realm of UFOs. The result of this saucer suppression? Angry congressional
hearings and the closure of Project Blue Book, the Air Force agency responsible
for investigating UFOs.</P>

<P>The Sixties' &quot;Saucergate&quot; was triggered on March 20, 1966,
when a glowing, football-shaped UFO was reported hovering above a swampy
area near the women's dormitory of a small college in Hillsdale, Michigan.
Witnesses included 87 female students and the local civil-defense director.
The following night in Dexter, 63 miles away, another UFO was spotted by
five people, including two police officers.</P>

<P>The Michigan sightings provoked a national outcry; in short, the public
wanted an explanation. Addressing the largest media gathering in the history
of the Detroit Free Press Club, Project Blue Book spokesman J. Allen Hynek,
an astronomer with Ohio State University, finally ventured an opinion.
He said the sightings might be due to &quot;swamp gas&quot;-methane gas
from rotting vegetation that had somehow spontaneously ignited. The explanation
didn't wash, and both Hynek and the Air Force found themselves the brunt
of immediate and almost universal ridicule. Newspapers had a field day
as cartoonists, columnists, and editorial writers nationwide lampooned
the Air Force suggestion.</P>

<P>In a letter to the House Armed Services Committee, then-Michagan congressman
and House Republican minority leader (and later president) Gerald R. Ford
called for congressional hearings on the subject, arguing that &quot;the
American Public deserves a better explanation than that thus far given
by the Air Force.&quot; The subcommittee subsequently held its hearing
on April 5, 1966, but only three individuals, all with Air Force connections,
were invited to testify: Hynek, then-Blue Book chief; Hector Quintanilla;
and Harold D. Brown, secretary of the Air Force. Brown told the committee,
chaired by L. Mendel Rivers, that they had no evidence of an extraterrestrial
origin of UFOs, nor was there any indication that UFOs constituted a threat
to national security.</P>

<P>Under scrutiny, however, the Air Force eventually agreed to an outside
review of Blue Book's files. Toward that end, the Air Force awarded $500,000
to the University of Colorado at Boulder. The major-domo of this extensive
review was physicist Edward U. Condon, former director of the National
Bureau of STandards. His second in command was the assistant dean of the
graduate school, Robert Low.</P>

<P>Initially, critics of the government's UFO policy were happy to see
the matter out of Air Force hands. But it didn't take long for their faith
in the Condon effort to fade. If the Air Force had tried to gloss over
the UFO issue, said retired Marine major Donald E. Keyhoe, director of
the civilian National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP),
the Condon Commission was even worse.</P>

<P>The day after his appointment, for instance, Condon was quoted in the
Denver Rocky Mountain News. He was &quot;no evidence,&quot; he said, for
&quot;advanced life on other planets.&quot; Moreover, he explained, the
study would give the public a &quot;better understanding of ordinary phenomena,
which, if recognized at once, would reduce the number of UFO reports.&quot;</P>

<P>Low, Condon's chief administrator, seems to have prejudged the reality
of UFOs, too. In a telling memo written to University administrators, Low
noted that &quot;the trick would be, I think, to describe the project so
that to the public it would appear a totally objective study but to the
scientific community would present the image of a group of non believers
trying their best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation
of finding a saucer.&quot;</P>

<P>Condon soon fired the two senior staffers he blamed for leaking the
memo to the press. Two weeks later, Mary Lou Armstrong, his own administrative
assistant resigned, citing low morale within the project as a whole. &quot;Low's
attitude from the beginning,&quot; she wrote, &quot;has been one of negativism.
[He] showed little interest in keeping current on sightings, either by
reading or talking with those who did.&quot; At one point, Low left for
a month, ostensibly to represent the Condon Committee at the International
AStronomical Union in Prague. Staff members suggested he use the opportunity
to meet with veteran UFO researchers in England and France. Instead, Low
went to Loch Ness, claiming that sea monsters and UFOs might share some
similarities since neither existed. Even so, there is no record that he
filed any written notes on his investigations.</P>

<P>The Condon Report was published in August of 1968 as the Scientific
Study of Unidentified Flying Objects. In all, 30 of the 91 cases analyzed
remained unidentified. Examining the famous McMinnville, Oregon, UFO photos,
for example, project investigators opined that this was &quot;one of the
few UFO reports in which all factors investigated, geometric, psychological,
and physical, appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary
flying object, silvery, metallic, disc shaped, flew within sight of two
witnesses.&quot; Of a radar/visual UFO sighting that occurred over Lakenheath,
England, in August of 1965, the study concluded that &quot;the probability
that at least one genuine UFO was involved appeared to be fairly high.&quot;</P>

<P>Yet these suggestions that an unidentified phenomenon might indeed be
afoot were buried in a bulky 1,500-page report. More readily accessible
to the media was Condon's conclusion, published at the beginning of the
study rather than at the end, as was standard scientific procedure. Essentially,
Condon concluded, &quot;further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot
be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby.&quot;</P>

<P>The Air Force seized the opportunity to withdraw from the minefield
of UFOs, and on December 17, 1969, called a press conference to announce
the closing of Project Blue Book. Citing the Condon report, acting secretary
of the Air Force, Robert C. Seamans, Jr., told reporters that Blue Book's
continuation could no longer &quot;be justified on grounds of national
security or in the interest of science.&quot;</P>

<P>Critics contend that Blue Book never mounted a thorough scientific investigation
of the UFO phenomenon to begin with, and that during its 22-year involvement
with the issue, it had functioned as little more than a public-relations
program. The charge, it turns out, was made by Hynek himself. In his last
interview, granted this reporter shortly before his death from a brain
tumor, Hynek avowed that while th Air Force always said it was interested
in the study of UFOs, officials regularly &quot;turned handsprings to keep
a good case from getting to the attention of the media. Any case they solved,&quot;
Hynek added, &quot;they had no trouble talking about. It was really sad.&quot;</P>

<P>As the Sixties came to a close, the Air Force finally got what it wanted:
It officially washed its hands of UFOs. Condon continued to deny the subject
was &quot;shrouded in secrecy.&quot; Overall, he said, the Air Force had
done a commendable job.</P>

<P>Hynek agreed, though for reasons of his own. &quot;The Air Force regarded
UFOs as an intelligence matter, and it became increasingly more and more
embarrassing to them,&quot; he said. &quot;After all, we paid good tax
dollars to have the Air Force guard our skies, and it would have been bad
public relations for them to say, 'Yes there's something up there, but
we're helpless.' They just couldn't do that, so they took the very human
action of protecting their own interests.&quot;</P>

<P>***************************************************************************</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SEX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="IV"></A>IV</P>

<P>Article by Dennis Stacy</P>

<P>This is the fourth in a six-part series on alleged UFO-related government
cover-ups. This segment covers the 1970s. Todd Zechel knows how David felt
the day he marched out to take on Goliath. Early in 1978, in otherwise
out-of-the-way Prairie due Sac, Wisconsin, Zechel helped found Citizens
Against UFO Secrecy, or CAUS. The group's mandate: to take on the behemoth
of the U.S. government, which had kept thousands of documents relevant
to UFO researchers under lock and key for years.</P>

<P>In the past, getting to those documents had been virtually impossible.
For the most part, they were buried within a paper labyrinth of agencies
within agencies, each employing its own unique form of &quot;bureauspeak&quot;
and filing. What was an &quot;unidentified flying object&quot; in one agency
might be an &quot;incident report&quot; or &quot;air space violation&quot;
in another. The reports might be in the form of a carbon copy, micro film,
or rapidly degrading thermal fax paper, barely legible in the original.
Other files were lost or routinely destroyed on a regular basis.</P>

<P>Still, one had to start somewhere, and CAUS was determined to track
down and make public as many of the existing documents as it could. In
its quest for truth, the new group would put out a newsletter called Just
Cause, and, with the help of UFO researcher Brad Sparks and attorney Peter
Gersten, tread legal waters no UFO group had entered before. &quot;We were
full of fire,&quot; Zechel now recalls. &quot;We had served the government
notice; we weren't going to take their stonewalling anymore, and if necessary,
we would haul them into court.&quot;</P>

<P>The euphoria was not misplaced. As the Seventies unfurled, most UFOlogists
felt that all they needed in the battle against the governmental Goliath
was one good slingshot. Any now that slingshot, in the form of the newly
enacted Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, was here.</P>

<P>Signed into law in 1966 by a Democratic Congress under President Lyndon
Johnson, FOIA (affectionately called &quot;foya&quot;) was created so the
public could access all but the most highly classified government records.
Nine categories of information were originally exempted from scrutiny,
beginning with those affecting national security and foreign policy and
then trickling down into fairly mundane materials like maps. UFOs, of course,
weren't mentioned at all.</P>

<P>Then, in the mid Seventies, the Nixon administration gave FOIA more
muscle still. Time limits were imposed on agencies receiving FOIA requests.
Affordable fees for the search and reproduction of requested documents
were established, and courts were empowered to decide whether or not specific
documents fell within the act's guidelines.</P>

<P>In the real world outside the halls of Congress, however, the soldiers
for CAUS found land mines strewn across the battlefield. The first CAUS
celebre, Zechel states, occurred before the Wisconsin group was officially
formed. It was 1977, and Zechel, Sparks, and Gersten made their stab at
wielding the FOIA through the auspices of the now defunct Ground Saucer
Watch, a UFO group based in Phoenix. In 1975, it turns out, the Phoenix
group's director Bill Spaulding, had written the CIA complaining it had
withheld a vast quantity of information on UFOs.</P>

<P>&quot;It wasn't an official FOIA request as such,&quot; Zechel says,
&quot;but more like an accusatory letter. Surprisingly, the CIA responded.&quot;</P>

<P>Specifically, Spaulding had referenced the case of one Ralph Mayher,
a marine photographer who claimed to have filmed a UFO over Miami Bay in
July of 1952. Mayher went on to become a celebrated news cameraman with
ABC news in Los Angeles. Not surprisingly, under the circumstances, he
also signed on as a consultant to one of the more prominent UFO organizations
of the day-the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, or
NICAP. Only years later did Mayher learn that, unbeknownst to him, his
original film had been turned over to the CIA for analysis.</P>

<P>Looking into the matter, the CIA's response to Spaulding was expected:
Its interest in UFOs was virtually nonexistent, the Agency declared, and
had been ever since 1952, when a panel of scientists met in Washington
to declare the phenomenon a public-relations problem, nothing more. But
much to Spaulding's surprise, the spy agency also released two documents
relating to the Mayher case. &quot;The Agency had blacked our about 70
percent of the documents,&quot; Zechel states, &quot;and also referred
to three other related documents still in their possession.&quot;</P>

<P>Zechel retained Gersten, who in 1977 filed a suit seeking full release
of all five documents. The case wound up in federal district court as GSW
vs. the CIA under the jurisdiction of Judge John Pratt. After protracted
legal maneuverings, lawyers for both sides finally met with representatives
of the attorney general's office in Washington in July of 1978.</P>

<P>&quot;At that meeting,&quot; according to Zechel, &quot;I had threatened
to have the CIA prosecuted for making false replies under the FOIA. Ultimately,
the Agency agreed to search all of its files for UFO records and to stipulate
which ones it would release and which it wouldn't. As the FOIA was structured
at the time, the CIA was also obligated to account for any deletions on
an item-by-item basis.&quot;</P>

<P>As Zechel recalls, the CIA missed its original 90-day deadline by 88
days. &quot;Then they dumped a stack of documents on our desk about two
to three feet thick, heavily blacked out, and with none of the deletions
accounted for,&quot; Zechel states. &quot;We now had 30 days to try to
identify and contest the deletions, which was humanly impossible.&quot;</P>

<P>Instead, Gersten filed a motion claiming the CIA stood in contempt of
court and clearly had not acted in good faith. The motion was filed after
GSW's own 30-day response deadline had expired, however, and Judge Pratt
summarily dismissed the suit. &quot;We were one day late,&quot; Zechel
recalls, &quot;and that effectively ended the suit.&quot;</P>

<P>But when all was said and done, the CIA decided to release some 900
pages of UFO-related documents. Indeed, like the CIA, many agencies decided
to release documents even when courts did not force their hands. A request
for UFO files from the FBI, for instance, netted almost 2,000 pages. By
scrutinizing documents obtained from the FBI and CIA, moreover, CAUS researchers
were able to identify witnesses. They could also pinpoint relevant incidents
likely to be described in documents on file with a host of other government
agencies.</P>

<P>Ultimately, CAUS would be responsible for the release of between 7,000
and 8,000 UFO-related documents from a who's who of official entities,
including the Air Force, Coast Guard, Navy, Defense Intelligence Agency,
North American Aerospace Defense Command, Federal Aviation Administration,
and others.</P>

<P>Among the major tidbits revealed were a series of sightings reported
from October through November 1975 by the northern tier of Air Force bases
from Montana to Maine; several of these sightings involved personnel stationed
at Minuteman silos. CAUS also uncovered a September 1976 file on an Imperial
Iranian Air Force jet that reportedly locked its radar onto a bright UFO
only to have its electronic weapons system fail.</P>

<P>CAUS's most celebrated suit, however, was the one it launched against
the supersecret National Security Agency (NSA) in December 1979. The case
was not fully resolved until March 1982 when the Supreme Court refused
to hear Gersten's appeal. Although the agency admitted to having approximately
57 documents pertaining to UFOs in its files, it successfully refused to
release them, citing national-security concerns.</P>

<P>Despite the progress, Zechel can't help wishing that CAUS had been able
to do more. &quot;I felt we could inflame the public and marshal tremendous
popular support,&quot; Zechel says, &quot;but we never got beyond four
or five hundred members. We were constantly hampered by a serious lack
of funds and the usual personality conflicts.&quot;</P>

<P>As for Gersten, he expresses disappointment that not every known document
was turned over to SAUS, especially those from the CIA and NSA, but concedes
that &quot;they were probably witheld for legitimate reasons. I suspect
they were protecting their own intelligence sources and technology.&quot;
Gersten performed all of his work for CAUS pro bono, but estimates that
his fees would have come to nearly $70,000. &quot;And that's in 1970 dollars,&quot;
he says.</P>

<P>As the decade of the 1970s came to a close, Zechel left CAUS and has
since founded the Associated Investigators Group. CAUS, meanwhile, continues
under different officers and still puts out its publication, Just CAUSE
on a regular basis.</P>

<P>&quot;What's changed most is the FOIA itself,&quot; says Barry Greenwood,
the newsletter's editor and current CAUS director of research. &quot;The
act was essentially gutted by Executive Order number 12356, signed by President
Ronald Reagan. Among other changes wrought by Reagan's general secrecy
order,&quot; according to Greenwood, &quot;is the fact that agencies are
no longer required to respond within a reasonable period of time. Searches,
when they do them at all now, routinely take between six months and two
years. The fees have gone up, too,&quot; Greenwood complains. &quot;One
agency cited us the enormous search fee of $250,000. It's very discouraging.&quot;</P>

<P>Pennsylvania researcher Robert Todd was also involved with CAUS early
on, but his experiences have left him disillusioned with both David and
Goliath. &quot;The UFO community won't be satisfied until the government
admits it's behind a vast cover-up,&quot; says Todd. &quot;Is there a lot
of material still being withheld? Without a doubt. But does that prove
the government is engaged in a massive conspiracy, or that it's merely
a massive bureaucracy? I can't state this strongly enough: I don't believe
there's a cover-up at all.&quot;</P>

<P>A spokesperson with the CIA's Freedom of Information office in Washington,
DC, refused a telephone request to talk to someone regarding the agency's
Freedom of Information Act policy, explaining that all such inquiries would
first have to be submitted in writing to John H. Wright, information and
privacy coordinator. Following agency guidelines, Omni has submitted a
written request for explanation of CIA policy as well as UFO documents,
past and present. The request is still pending but remained unanswered
at press time. Results of our inquiry will have to wait for a future edition
of the magazine.</P>

<P>As far as the UFO community is concerned, the work of CAUS, Zechel-style,
remains undone. These days, says Todd, &quot;getting any kind of document
out of the government is a lengthy, time consuming process. First, they
consider the FOIA an annoyance; after all, they're understaffed and saddled
with budget constraints. Second, the nature of any government is to control
the flow of information.&quot;</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS PART <A NAME="V"></A>V
Article by Dennis Stacy and Patrick Huyghe</P>

<P>This is the fifth piece in a six-part series on government secrecy and
UFOs through the decades. Here we look at the 1980s.</P>

<P>From their vantage point 22,300 miles above the earth's surface, a fleet
of supersecret military satellites monitors our planet for missile launches
and nuclear detonations. On a clear day, these satellites can see forever,
so it's no surprise when they also pick up erupting volcanos, oil-well
fires, incoming meteors, sunlight reflections off the ocean, and a host
of other head sources, including those that still remain unexplained.</P>

<P>Since 1985, all this data has been beamed down in near real-time to
the U.S. Space Command's Missile Warning Center, operating from within
Cheyenne Mountain, near Colorado Springs. The purpose: coordinating satellite-based
early warning systems for the army, navy, air force, and marines. Whether
harmless or threatening, the information has always been a guarded national
secret. But suddenly, in 1993, with the Cold War over, the Defense Department
agreed to declassify some satellite information not related to intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) launches and nuclear events. Since then, scientists
ranging from astronomers to geophysicists have rushed to get their hands
on this motherload of data.</P>

<P>Among researchers hoping to glean some truth from the declassified data
are UFOlogists, long frustrated by the critic's classic retort: &quot;If
UFOs are real, why haven't they been detected by our satellites?&quot;
Well, some UFO researchers are now saying, they have been. With access
to the most sophisticated space data ever generated, say some UFO researchers,
they may finally find the Holy Grail of their profession: bona fide, irrefutable,
nuts-and-bolts proof of UFOs.</P>

<P>As this series of articles explains, UFO researchers have been searching
for such evidence in government vaults for years. In the Fifties and Sixties,
some UFOlogists claimed, the military kept alien corpses and a ship under
wraps. The search for proof was fueled throughout the Seventies by the
Freedom of Information Act, which yielded thousands of pages of government
documents, but no hard, technical, incontrovertible evidence of UFOs. Finally,
in the 1980s, a supposedly explosive memo revealed the existence of a top-secret
group, dubbed MJ12, made up of high-level government officials devoted
to the secret reality of UFOs. Only problem is, according to most UFO experts,
the memo was a hoax. Of course, data from crude detection systems like
gun cameras and radar were available. But they merely confirmed the obvious:
that military and goverment personnel, like many other sectors of the population,
saw and reported mysterious lights in the sky.</P>

<P>If they could ever prove their theories, UFOlogists knew, they would
have to tap the most sophisticated information-gathering technology available:
Department of Defense spy satellites, like the Defense Support Program
(DSP) satellites, in geosynchronous orbit above the earth. In face, rumor
had it, heat, light, and infrared sensors at the heart of the satellites
were routinely picking up moving targets clearly not missiles and tagged
&quot;Valid IR Source.&quot; Some of these targets were given the mysterious
code name of &quot;Fast Walker.&quot;</P>

<P>Unfortunately for UFOlogists, few secrets in this country's vast military
arsenal have been so closely guarded as the operational parameters of DSP
satellites. Even their exact number is classified. &quot;That shouldn't
surprise anyone,&quot; explains Captain John Kennedy, public affairs officer
with the USAF Space Command Center at Peterson Air Force Base. &quot;It's
an early ICBM launch detection system, and we have to protect our own technology
for obvious reasons. If everyone knew what the system's capabilities were,
they would try to take steps to get around it.&quot; But in recent years,
thanks to a loosening of the reigns, a few tantalizing tidbits of information
have managed to seep under the satellite secrecy dam, allowing UFOlogists
a small glimpse of some surprising nearspace events.</P>

<P>The first issue for UFOlogists to examine, explains Ron Regehr of Aerojet
General in California, the company that builds the DSP sensor systems,
is whether the satellites could detect UFOs even if we wanted them to.
According to Regehr, who has worked on the satellite sensors for the last
25 years and even wrote its operational software specifications, the answer
to that question was revealed in 1990, during Operation Desert Storm. &quot;As
we know,&quot; says Regehr, &quot;the satellites picked up every one of
the 80 Iraqi Scud launches, and the Scud is a very low-intensity infrared
source compared to the average ICBM.&quot;</P>

<P>Pursuing the matter further, Regehr turned to an article published in
MIJI Quarterly, &quot;Now You See It, Now You Don't,&quot; which detailed
a September, 1976 UFO encounter near Teheran. The incident nivolved two
brilliantly glowing UFOs first seem by ground observers. One object, or
light source, an estimated 30 feet in diameter, reportedly went from ground
level to an altitude of 40,000 feet, and was visible at a distance of 70
miles. An Imperial Iranian Air Force F-4 jet fighter was sent aloft and
managed to aim a Sidewinder AIM-19 air-to-air missile at the target before
its electronic systems failed.</P>

<P>&quot;Apart from the visible light factor, there's the indication that
the UFO gave off enough infrared energy for the Sidewinder's IR sensor
to lock on to it,&quot; says Regehr. &quot;You can do a few simple calculations,&quot;
he adds, &quot;and conclude that teh DSP satellites of the day should easily
have been able to see the same thing. Of course, I can't say they did,
or if they did, whether or not it was recorded in the database.&quot;</P>

<P>Part of the problem, according to Regehr, is the sheer mountain of data
that the DSP satellites generate. On average, an infrared portrait of the
earth's surface and surrounding space is downloaded every ten seconds.
All of the data is then stored on larget 14-inch reels of magnetic tape,
&quot;the kind,&quot; says Regehr, &quot;that you always see spinning around
in science fiction movies, and which fill up in about 15 minutes.&quot;
The tapes are eventually erased and reused.</P>

<P>Technicians visually monitor the datastream on a near real-time basis,
but only follow up a narrow range of events-those that match up with what
the air force calls &quot;tamplates.&quot; Based on known rocket fuel burn
times and color spectra, the templates are used to identify ballistic missile
launches and nuclear explosions. But the system also picks up other infrared
events ranging from mid-air collisions of planes to oil-well fires and
volcanoes.</P>

<P>&quot;I would say that rarely a week goes by that we don't get some
kind of infrared source that is avalid, or real, but physicist and consultant
to the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California, a nonprofit air
force satellite engineering contractor. &quot;But once we determine it
isn't a threat, that's basically the end of our job. We aren't paid to
look at each and every one.&quot;</P>

<P>Tagliaferri and a handful of colleagues are among the few civilian space
scientists who have thus far been allowed access to the Department of Defense
database. Their research, based on spy satellite data declassified in the
fall of 1993, is part of a chapter in Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids,
from the University of Arizona Press. &quot;I think the air force finally
agreed that the data had scientific, as well as political and global security
value,&quot; says Tagliaferri.</P>

<P>What Tagliaferri and his collaborators were able to confirm was that
between 1975 and 1992, DOD satellites detected 136 upper-atmosphere explosions,
a few equivalent in energy to the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. Unlike the three-to ten-minute burn periods of an ICBM, these
previously unacknowledged &quot;flash events&quot; typically take place
in a matter of seconds. They are attributable to meteorites and small asteroids.
&quot;Most of what we see are objects that are probably 10 to 50 meters
in diameter, about the size of a house, and packing 300 times the kinetic
energy of dynamite,&quot; Tagliaferri says.</P>

<P>The ramification, however, is that nervous governments might mistake
these flash events for nuclear bombsaimed in their direction and trigger
a like response. One of the brightest unknown flash events occurred over
indonesia on April 15, 1988, shortly before noon, exploding with the approximate
firepower of 5.000 tons of high explosives. A slightly less powerful detonation
shook an uninhabited expance of the Pacific Ocean on October 1, 1990, in
the midst of Operation Deser Shield.</P>

<P>&quot;But what if the latter event had exploded a little lower in the
atmosphere, and over, say Baghdad?&quot; Tagliaferri warns. &quot;The consequences
could well have been disastrous. Ground observers would have seen a fireball
the brightness of the sun and heard a shock wave rattle windows. Given
the mindset of the Iraqis, Israelis, and the other combatants in the area
at that time, any of them might have concluded that they were under nuclear
attack and responded accordingly.&quot;</P>

<P>The argument that some UFOs might be capable of triggering a similar
false alarm ahs been made many times in the past by, among others, the
Soviets. An article titled &quot;UFOs and Security,&quot; which appeared
in the June, 1989 issue of Soviet Military Review, states: &quot;We believe
that lack of information on the characteristics an dinfluence of UFOs increases
the threat of incorrect identification. Then, mass transit of UFOs along
trajectories close to those of combast missiles could be regarded by computers
as an attack.&quot;</P>

<P>But when asked if some unknowns detected by satellite sensors might
represent real UFOs rather than incoming meteorites, Tagliaferri chuckles.
&quot;Personally, I don't think so,&quot; he says. &quot;But who knows?
How can you tell? I'm a scientist, a physicist, and to my mind the evidence
of UFOs is just not convicing. On the other hand, I've been wrong before.&quot;</P>

<P>UFOlogists, meanwhile, think that proof might be lurking in the stacks
of printouts from the DSP system computers. But the only material of this
sort likely to see the light of day will probably have to come from inside
leaks. And that may have already happened. One UFO researcher, using sources
he won't reveal, has turned up evidence of what he believes mihgt be a
UFO tracked by satellite. Last year, aJoe Stefula, formerly a special agent
with the army's Criminal Investigation Command, made public on several
electronic bulletin boards what purports to be a diagram of an infrared
even detected by a DSP satellite on May 5, 1984. &quot;I haven't been able
to determine that the document's absolutely authentic,&quot; says Stefula,
&quot;but I have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date
shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics.&quot;</P>

<P>According to Stefula's alleged source, now said to be retired from the
military, the offical code name for unidentified objects exhibiting ballistic
missile characteristics is Fast Walker. &quot;But what makes this particular
Fast Walker so peculiar,&quot; says Stefula, &quot;is that it comes in
from outer space on a curved trajectory, passes within three kilometers
of the satellite platform, and then disappears back into space. Whatever
it is, it was tracked for nine minutes. That doesn't sound like a meteorite
to me.&quot;</P>

<P>Regehr agrees: &quot;It was there too long. It was going too slow. It
didn't have enough speed for escape velocity.&quot; But escape it did.</P>

<P>The May, 1984 event allegedly generated a 300-page internal report,
only portions of which are classified, though non of it has yet been released.
&quot;I don't think they would do a 300-page report on everything they
detect,&quot; says Stefula, whose efforts to obtain the report have so
far been unsuccessful, &quot;so there must have been something significant
about this that led them to look into it. My source told me that they basically
looked at every possibility and couldn't explain it by natural or man-made
means.&quot;</P>

<P>Nor was this apparently an isolated event. According to the unnamed
source, such Fast Walkers are detected, on the average, &quot;two to three
times a month.&quot;</P>

<P>Even longtime arch-UFO skeptic Philip J. Klass, contributing avionics
editor to Aviaton Week and Space Technology, admits that the military's
DSP satellites could detect physical flying saucers from outer space-but
with one very large proviso: &quot;If you assume,&quot; says Klass, &quot;that
a UFO traveling at, say 80,000 feet leaves a long strong plume liek a space
shuttle launch. But we know that isn't the way UFOs are usually reported.&quot;</P>

<P>Part of the problem, according to Klass, who has written a book on military
spy satellites titled Secret Sentries in Space, is that the DSP system
has performed better than spec. &quot;It's too good, or too sensitive,
if you prefer,&quot; he says. &quot;In fact, it was so good that it was
sent back to research and development for fine tuning, in order to eliminate
as many false alarms as possible. Obviously, we didn't want a fuel storage
tank fire next to a Soviet missile silo to set off a launch alarm,&quot;
he explains. &quot;Nor did we want the system to track the dozens or hundreds
of Russian jet fighters in the air every day.&quot;</P>

<P>Klass's best guess is that the mysterious May, 1984 Fast Walker even
uncovered by Stefula probably represents nothing more than a classified
mission flown by our own SR-71 high-altitude Blackbird spyplane. &quot;it's
admittedly too long a duration to be a meteor fireball,&quot; he concedes,
&quot;but the Blackbird typically flies at an altitude of 80,000 to 100,000
feet, which makes its afterburner trail easily visible to the DSP system.&quot;</P>

<P>In the same context, says Klass, Fast Walker might be a code name for
the recently retired SR-71 itself, or, conceivably, its Soviet counterpart,
assuming the Soviets had one at the time. Either way, Klass concludes,
&quot;It's no surprise that the air force would want to keep much of this
information secret.&quot;</P>

<P>Apparently, keep most of it secret they will. Despite the success Tagliaferri
and a few others had in getting past the military censors, don't anticipate
a flood of similar studies, especially one in search of UFO reports. &quot;I
don't see the air force declassifying a whole lot more of the DSP data
to other scientists, not without an incredible amount of cleanup,&quot;
says Captain Kennedy. &quot;And it's certainly not accessible to requests
through the Freedom of Information Act.&quot;</P>

<P>Even if some unknowns turn out to be UFOs, the Air Force Space Command
isn't going to hand UFOlogists-or anyone else-that information on a silver
platter. Meanwhile, the dividing line between what might constitute extraterrestrial
technology and our own twentieth century equivalent grows increasingly
narrow and blurred with every new device sent into space. Somewhere out
there, no doubt, is a sensor system that already knows whether we are being
visited by UFOs or not, but the owners of those systems aren't talking.</P>

<P>COSMIC CONSPIRACY: SIX DECADES OF GOVERNMENT UFO COVER-UPS</P>

<P>PART <A NAME="VI"></A>VI</P>

<P>Editor's note (Omni Mag): In the final installment of our six-part series
on alleged government cover-ups and UFOs, we look at the most controversial
case of the 1990s. </P>

<P>The sun sinks beyond the jagged Groom Mountains like a bloated red basketball.
As temperatures plummet in the thin desert air, we make our way up a narrow
arroyo to the base of White Sides, a towering jumble of limestone ledges
overlooking the super-secret air base below, our hiking boots making crunching
sounds in the growing darkness.</P>

<P>We've been whispering and walking side-by-side. Now our guide, a young
mountain goat by the name of Glenn Campbell, takes the lead. &quot;Damn!&quot;
he suddenly hisses, &quot;They've erased them again,&quot; referring to
the orange arrows spray-painted on the rocks a few days earlier. &quot;They&quot;
are the anonymous individuals Campbell refers to as the &quot;cammo dudes.&quot;
Thought to be civilian employees of the Air Force, they patrol the perimeter
of the unacknowledged base in white all-terrain vehicles, monitoring electronic
detectors and, by the way, erasing signposts like those on the rocks. When
interlopers cross the military boundaries or haul out their cameras, it's
the cammo dudes who call in the local constabulary, the Lincoln County
Sheriff's Department, to confiscate the film.</P>

<P>Campbell assures us that we don't have to worry, though. For one thing,
we all agreed to leave our cameras locked in our cars at the bottom of
White Sides. For another, we're still on public property, well outside
the restricted zone which comprises part of the vast Nellis Air Force Range
complex and stretches more than halfway from here to Las Vegas, 100 miles
away. &quot;Besides,&quot; he says cheerfully, &quot;it'll take the sheriff
40 minutes to get here. By that time we'll already be on top, and he'll
have to wait for us to get down.&quot;</P>

<P>Still, White Sides is no cake walk. Beginning at about 5,000 feet, it
rises in altitude for another 1,000 feet. From here, however, you can peer
down on one of the world's longest runways and one of the Cold War's most
isolated inner sanctums. It was here, variously known as Groom Lake, Area
51, Dreamland, or simply the Ranch, that sophisticated black-budget (that
is, off-the-record) projects like the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117A
Stealth fighter first earned their wings in secrecy. And it was 15 miles
south of here, at an even more clandestine (and controversial) base of
operations known as Area S4 at Papoose Lake, that shadowy physicist Robert
Lazar claimed to have helped study captured flying-saucer technology.</P>

<P>Because of its remoteness, spying on alleged Area S4 is out of the question,
which leaves Groom Lake as the next best UFO mecca, assuming the many rumors
surrounding these remote outposts are rooted even in half-truths. We break
out our binoculars and sweep the runway, clearly outlined by a string of
small red lights. At one end, backed up against the base of the Groom Mountains,
squats a collection of radar arrays and giant hangars, feebly illuminated
on this Saturday night by fan-shaped rays of yellow light. &quot;Looks
like they're shut down for the weekend,&quot; Campbell whispers.</P>

<P>Still, the thrill of visually eavesdropping on this country's most secret
air base sends a certain chill up the spine, where it mingles with the
growing desert chill and the memory of the signs at the bottom of White
Sides authorizing the use of deadly force. All remains eerily silent, however;
not so much as a cricket, cammo dude, sheriff, or UFO disturbs the night.
After a few hours of fruitless surveillance, fingers and toes numbed by
the cold, we start back down.</P>

<P>Campbell, a retired computer programmer, explains why he left the comfy
confines on his native Boston and moved lock, stock, and Mac Powerbook
to Rachel, a hardscrabble community of 100 smack in the middle of the Nevada
desert. &quot;You go where the UFO stories are,&quot; he says, &quot;and
in the fall of 1992, when I first came here Dreamland was where they were.&quot;
Campbell had read an article published the year before in the monthly journal
of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) detailing some of the exploits of Lazar,
who claimed to have actually been aboard one of nine recovered flying saucers
sequestered at Area S4 while helping reverse-engineer their apparent antigravity
propulsion system. In a series of November 1989 interviews with then anchorman
George Knapp of KLAS-TV, the Las Vegas CBS affiliate, Lazar went public
with his claims. Dreamland, at least, was now in the public domain.</P>

<P>Though Lazar's credibility has recently taken a nosedive, even with
UFO insiders, Knapp, now senior vice president with the Altamira Communications
Group, an independent video production company, notes that &quot;stories
of captured or acquired alien technology have circulated in the area since
the mid 1950s and the very beginning of the base.&quot; His best source,
among the 14 he has interviewed to date, is a member of a prominent Nevada
family who will not allow his name to be used, although he has supposedly
videotaped a deposition to be given to Knapp upon his death. According
to Knapp, his source occupied a position of senior management at Groom
Lake during the late Fifties and early Sixties, and admitted that at least
one extraordinary craft was being test flown and taken apart. &quot;It's
the totality of the accounts, not any specific one, that I find convincing,&quot;
says Knapp.</P>

<P>Spurred by the local lore following his first visit, Campbell returned
to Boston, packed his belongings in a rickety Toyota camper, and in January
of 1993 moved to Rachel, setting up shop in the dusty parking lot of the
Little A-Le-Inn, a combination bar and restaurant turned UFO museum, joint
jumping-off point, watering-hole headquarters, and sometime conference
center for UFOlogists hoping to repeat the earlier Lazar sightings. Campbell
began his own investigation and was soon desktop publishing the Area 51
Viewer's Guide, of which he estimates he has now sold more than 2,000 copies.</P>

<P>As reports of UFOs in the area soared, so did Campbell's reputation
as de facto onsite guide. In the last year alone, virtually every major
media outlet in the country, from CNN, NBC, and ABC News to the New York
Times, Despite the temptation to turn tabloid, Campbell seems to have kept
his head on straight. &quot;I am still interested in the UFO phenomenon,&quot;
he says, &quot;but the evidence has to speak for itself. I've been living
here night and day for over a year now and still haven't seen anything
that couldn't be explained.&quot; He's also seen satisfied believers come
and go. &quot;But most of what they report,&quot; Campbell warns, &quot;is
ordinary military activity, from Russian MiGs to parachute flares. You
pretty much see what you want to see, depending on what kind of expectations
you bring to the table.&quot;</P>

<P>A case in point is so-called Old Faithful. In the wake of Lazar's allegations,
observers were soon reporting a brilliant UFO adhering to a rigid schedule
at 4:50 every weekday morning. Campbell, a UFOlogists who readily admits
he likes his sleep, nonetheless routinely roused himself-until he became
convinced that what he was seeing was nothing more than the landing lights
of a approaching 737. Methodical by nature, Campbell purchased a radio
scanner and began monitoring flights outside McCarran Airport in Las Vegas.
It turned out that Janet, a private charter airline, routinely flies into
Groom Lake from Las Vegas, transporting workers as Lazar had previously
alleged. Old Faithful was their early morning flight, and in the next release
of his Viewer's Guide, Campbell published the airline's complete schedule.</P>

<P>But stories of alleged alien involvement at or near Area 51 continue.
On the evening of March 16, 1993 William Hamilton, director of investigations
for MUFON Los Angeles, and a companion were parked alongside Highway 375
near the popular Black Mailbox viewing area when a bright light winked
into view to their right. &quot;I looked at it through binoculars,&quot;
Hamilton remembers, &quot;and it seemed to be on or near the Groom Road
and casting a beam [of light] on the ground.&quot; As it drew nearer, according
to Hamilton, &quot;the light appeared to be an object the size of a bus
with square light panels lifting off from the ground. The panels appeared
to glow amber and blue-white.&quot;</P>

<P>A bus does travel the dirt road leading into Groom Lake, transporting
civilian workers who gather every morning at nearby Alamo for the 30- to
40-mile ride, returning in the afternoon. But this bus was clearly out
of the ordinary, says Hamilton. As he watched, &quot;the lights rapidly
resolved into two glowing orbs or discs of brilliant blue-white light,
so bright they hurt my eyes.&quot; The two baby suns rapidly approached
the parked car and confusion reigned. When Hamilton looked at his watch,
approximately 30 minutes of time were missing. Hypnotically regressed later,
both Hamilton and his companion had memories of being abducted aboard a
UFO by now-traditional little gray beings with large dark eyes, the leader
of whom in this case referred to himself as Quaylar.</P>

<P>Campbell was at the Little A-Le-Inn when the couple returned. &quot;I
can attest they were both visibly shaken,&quot; he says, &quot;but neither
had any memory of an abduction at that time. I don't know what to think.
I've spent many a night in Tikaboo Valley, where the sighting occurred,
and as far as I know nothing like that has ever happened to me. I've never
seen or experienced anything that I couldn't explain.&quot;</P>

<P>It may be that the remote desert interface between alleged extraterrestrial
technology and known or suspected terrestrial technology predisposes or
inflames the human imagination to see flying buses where only earthly ones
exist. Light can play tricks in the thin air, making determination of distance
and brilliance doubly difficult at best. Or it could be that the latest
generation of Stealth and other secret platforms being test flown out of
Groom Lake demonstrate such odd performance characteristics that they are
easily misidentified at night as one of Lazar's reputed H=PACs-Human-Piloted
Alien Craft. Rumors have long circulated of a hypersonic high-altitude
spyplane, code named Aurora, designed to replace the recently retired SR-71
Blackbird. Both the Air Force and Aurora's alleged manufacturer, Northrop's
secret Skunk Works facility at Palmdale, California, deny any knowledge
of such a platform. Another potential candidate is the TR-33A Black Mantra,
an electronic warfare platform widely rumored to have flown support for
the F-117 Stealth fighter during Operation Desert Storm. Other advanced
airforms could be in research and development, too, their operating expenditures
buried in the Pentagon's estimated $14.3 billion per year black-budget
programs.</P>

<P>Even with the Cold War apparently successfully concluded-and the strategic
necessity of much of our black budget presumably obviated-the Air Force
can't be happy campers at Groom Lake. They certainly don't relish the prospect
of a growing number of UFOlogists and media types, increasingly armed with
sophisticated video cameras and night-vision equipment, all on the prowl
for H-PACs or UFOs, stumbling across a plane which they've gone to a great
deal of trouble to keep secret from both Russian and American citizens,
presumably in our own best interests.</P>

<P>But previous attempts to seal off Groom Lake from public scrutiny have
met with just partial success. In 1984, the Air Force seized (or withdrew,
in their vernacular) some 89,000 acres on the northeast quadrant of the
Nellis Test Range in order to provide a better buffer zone for the base.
Due to a surveying error, White Sides and a few other vantage points were
overlooked. But then, in the wake of the Lazar story, Campbell and other
UFOlogists began making the trek up White Sides, triggering security perimeter
alarms and forcing the cammo dudes out of their white vehicles.</P>

<P>Subsequently, on October 18, 1993, the Air Force filed a request for
Federal Register seeking the withdrawal of an additional 3,7982 acres,
presently public property under the control of the Bureau of Land Management.
Not surprisingly, White Sides is contained within the new acreage, as is
another lookout point discovered by Campbell and dubbed Freedom Ridge.
The additional land was needed, the Air Force claimed, &quot;to ensure
the public safety and the safe and secure operation of activities in the
Nellis Air Force Range complex.&quot; No mention by name was made of Groom
Lake, the air base that doesn't officially exist.</P>

<P>By now, Campbell had become a professional prickly=pear int he Air Force's
exposed side. He formed the White Sides Defense Committee and publicized
the public hearing the Bureau of Land Management was required by law to
hold. The Air Force request is currently on hold, awaiting an environmental
assessment and final approval. In the meantime, Campbell formed Secrecy
OVersight Council to market his Viewers Guide and an assortment of Area
51 souvenirs, including topographical maps, bumper stickers, and a colorful,
self-designed Groom Lake sew-on patch. More recently, he took out an address
on the electronic highway and began publishing a series of regular digital
updates, &quot;The Desert Rat,&quot; including a map detailing the location
of known magnetic sensors. And he tweaked a few local noses with a defiant
fashion statement, updating his own apparel to match the desert camouflage
suite of the cammo dudes, shade for shade.</P>

<P>Such pranks aside, Campbell insists he's a serious civilian spy. &quot;The
difference between me and the Air Force is that I don't have any secrets,&quot;
he says, &quot;and everything I do is legal.&quot; On at least two occasions
Campbell and visiting journalists were buzzed by low-flying helicopters
called in from Groom Lake, both times while clearly on public property
outside the restricted zone. &quot;The rotor wash throws up a tremendous
amount of dust and debris,&quot; he notes, &quot;endangering us and the
helicopter crew, too.&quot; Indeed, the Secrecy Oversight Council tracked
down the appropriate Air Force regulation and found that pilots are restricted
to a minimum of 500 feet altitude except when taking off or landing.</P>

<P>But if the Air Force is peeved or perplexed by Campbell's activities,
they aren't saying so in public. &quot;We know who Mr Campbell is,&quot;
admits Major George Sillia, public affairs officer at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas.
&quot;He keeps us informed as to what he's up to. Beyond that, what can
I say? He's an American citizen, and they have a right to certain activities
on public property.&quot; The Air Force is more mum about the existence
of Groom Lake itself. &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny the existence
of a facility at Groom Lake,&quot; Sillia adds, &quot;and if we can't confirm
its existence, we certainly can't say anything about it.&quot;</P>

<P>A more vocal Campbell critic is Jim Bilbray, a Democratic congressman
from Las Vegas who sits on both the House Armed Services Committee and
the Select House Committee on Intelligence. Without mentioning Campbell
by name, Bilbray says that &quot;these people are persistent, and if they're
taking pictures, they're breaking the law. But that really isn't the problem;
there's even a Soviet satellite photo of Groom Lake in circulation. The
problem comes when you have to shut down operations and secure the technology,
which is time-consuming and costly, and which they have to do every time
someone is up on the mountain. And believe me, they make sure they know
when you're up there.&quot;</P>

<P>Bilbray also doesn't subscribe to the argument that now that the Cold
War is apparently over there is a concurrent corollary that reduces the
need for secrecy in general and secret high-tech technology in particular.
&quot;The Nellis Range is one of the few secure areas in the country where
you can test these new technologies,&quot; he says. &quot;And most people
in the intelligence community will tell you that the world is a more, not
less, dangerous place, now that the old system of checks and balances between
the two superpowers has seriously broken down.&quot;</P>

<P>Still, Bilbray admits that he, the Air Force, and other government agencies
are caught in a classic Catch-22 situation vis-a-vis UFOlogists. &quot;I
can't name them,&quot; he says, &quot;but I can tell you that I've been
on virtually every facility in the Nellis Range and that there are no captured
flying saucers or extraterrestrial bodies out there. I've heard all the
rumors. But the minute I say I've been to one valley, the UFOlogists are
going to ask, what about the next valley over, or claim that everything
has been moved. Well, what about the next valley over? We used to test
atomic bombs above ground here and some of the valleys are still so hot
that a Geiger counter will start spitting the moment you turn it on. Doesn't
sound like a very good place to test flying saucers or hide alien bodies
to me.&quot;</P>

<P>But researchers like Campbell say they're in a Catch-22 as well, because
they know the Air Force routinely denies things that do exist, beginning
with the big secret base on the edge of Groom Lake. If it didn't exist,
why would they need more space to keep you from seeing it? And if Groom
Lake exists, then why not Aurora, the Black Mantra, and possibly even a
UFO or two?</P>

<P>Nature abhors a vacuum, and where a lack of openness and penchant for
secrecy persists, rumor and rumors of rumors are sure to flourish, even
in the middle of the desert. &quot;You just keep shaking the secrecy tree,&quot;
and unperturbed and determined Campbell advises, &quot;and, hopefully,
something drops out.&quot;</P>

<P>That may prove increasingly difficult to do, at least from White Sides
or Freedom Ridge. Bilbray, who supports the latest withdrawal of land around
Groom Lake, advises that Congress, while it has the opportunity to object
and call for a review, does not have to give approval, and the Bureau of
Land Management will most assuredly approve the Air Force's request, &quot;probably
within this year.&quot;</P>

<P>FDA SWAT TEAM SEIZES GASTON NAESSENS INFORMATION</P>

<P>Denial of the freedom of thought and speech has apparently become an
element of the FDA's drive to regulate medicine in the U.S.A. In July,
and FDA SWAT team invaded teh New York offices of a publishing company
to seize information concerning the use of an unapproved material as a
cancer treatment.</P>

<P>Materials seized from Writers and Research, Inc. of Rochester, NY, included
books and booklets on a controversial camphor-based treatment for cancer
called 714X, developed by Gaston Naessens. Also seized was computer equipment,
a seizure justified by an agent because it was &quot;used to print information
on a substance that is banned in the US&quot;. The drug itself was not
the target of the raid-only information about it, as well as files of people
who had expressed interest in it.</P>

<P>Writers and Research had contacted the FDA in the process of obtaining
approval to import 714X into the United States. Towards this end, the company
had constituted an Institutional Review Board to examine the claims made
for 714X, a step necessary to gaining FDA approval. This had been done
two months prior to the FDA raid. The FDA had not disqualified this board,
but had prohibited any reference to its findings before approval.</P>

<P>In Short, the FDA raided a company prior to that company achieving its
stated desire of gaining approval for an alternative medicine. They did
not raid to seize medicine. They raided to stop dissemination of information
about that medicine.</P>

<P>BIG BROTHER &amp; CLINTON'S HEALTH SECURITY ACT</P>

<P>Clinton's health care plan ensures that everyone has access to medical
care- and ravages the Bill of Rights in the process. If one reads the 1342
page Health Security Act, as Jarret Wollstein did, one wonders what Machiavellian
mind devised it. Jarret WOllstein, Director of the International Society
for Individual Liberty and co-author of Lethal Compassion: WHy National
Health Care is the Cure that Kills, explained in an interview published
by The Financial Privacy Report (May 1994) how Clinton's health care bill
affects freedom of choice and medical privacy.</P>

<P>FIrst, Clinton's plan states that everyone &quot;must enroll&quot; in
a government-run health alliance and &quot;must pay any premium required&quot;.
The health premium is actually a payroll tax of 7.6% of the pay cheque,
which is about equal to the amount removed from employees' cheques for
Social Security. Imagine trying to survive on a minimum wage with another
7.6% taken out. Where is the incentive to work if the pay cheque at the
end of the month can't begin to pay for food and housing? The amount of
this &quot;premium&quot; is set by the local health alliance and a politically
appointed National Health Board at their discretion. No ceiling amound
has been set. Self-employed people who refuse to pay or can't afford to
pay are fined three times the amount of premium, or US$5,000, whichever
is higher. If they don't pay, the government has the right to seize their
assets. In other words, we hav eno choice but to pay for this plan, whether
we want it or not. We don't even get to vote on it.</P>

<P>But all of us will get the health care we want or need under this plan,
right? Wrong. As Wollstein points out, approximately 37 million more people
will have access to clinics and doctors. To regulate the increased flow,
government &quot;gatekeepers&quot; no patients, not doctors-willdecide
who gets in to see a doctor or into a hospital. Anyone who tries to bypass
the health plan and use his or her own money to pay for covered medical
services faces 15 years imprisonment and fines up to US$50,000-that is,
if you can find a doctor willing to risk the same penalties.</P>

<P>Under the Health Security Act, the Department of Justice also has the
right to confiscate anything you own if you are accused, not necessarily
convicted, of threatening the health of anyone or having a &quot;significant
detrimental impact on the health care system&quot;. Curiously, no monies
have been budgeted to fund this new policing bureau. In its own self-interest,
the bureau will have to be zealous in its confiscation of property.</P>

<P>Finally, Clinton's Health Security Bill forbids doctors from withholding
information about their patients from the government; medical privacy will
no longer be honored. Doctors can be fined up to US$10,000 per violation,
without trial. This information, according to the health act, can be used
for any &quot;lawful purpose&quot;, and the National Health Board is authorized
to get other information about individuals from any other government agency,
including the ISR. Why does a health board need such powers?</P>

<P>The abridgement of freedom and righst in this Health Security Act is
too high a price to pay for universal health care. Congress apparently
agrees. Senate Bill 1227 exempts members of Congress and all federal employees
from any national health care plan. If they don't want it, why should we?</P>

<P>WILL MOBILE PHONES BECOME MOBILE ID TAGS?</P>

<P>Not many people realise that the technology exists to track a person's
whereabouts from their mobile phone handset via certain types of satellites.</P>

<P>The next step in our technological 'evolution' from the consumer's point
of view is that virtually everyone will have their own personal mobile
phone, with their own personal mobile phone ID number. Each of these mobile
phone handsets emits a virtually continous signal which is picked up by
satellite or ground tower and relayed on. It is rumoured that most handsets
emit this signal even when the power is turned off. It is any Big Brother's
dream come true in terms of knowing where everyone is at any time.</P>

<P>It was announced in UK newspapers recently that by 1988, mobile phones
will go global. Your handset will give you access to a satellite based
system that will allow calls to be made pracctically anywhere on Earth.</P>

<P>&quot;Iridium, a consortium of 17 major companies led by Motorola, proposes
to launch 66 satellites in orbits corssing both poles, ensuring a satellite
will fly over every spot on Earth at least once every nine minutes. Any
any one time at least three satellites will be in view, enabling the handset's
precise position to be located.&quot;</P>

<P>CANADIAN NEO-NAZI GROUP CREATED BY BRITAIN'S MI5?</P>

<P>Canada's government-appointed intelligence watchdog group is investigating
allegations that the Canadian Secret Intelligence Service (CSIS), the counterpart
of Britain's MI5, founded and steered Canada's main neo-Nazi organization,
Heritage Front.</P>

<P>These allegations are also made in a book, titled The Ugly Truth about
the ADL, which uncovers most neo-Nazi provocateurs as a completely controlled
international product of British intelligence operations in North America
and elsewhere, with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) playing a special
starring role.</P>

<P>According to the Toronto Sun, one Grant Bristow organised the Heritage
Front whiilst in receipt of $50,000 per year from the CSIS, and then &quot;threw
himself into running a small unit of the front that specialised in dirty-tricks
campaigns against anti-racists&quot; by infiltrating such groups and setting
them up against each other.</P>

<P>The tactics of creating an imaginary enemy to justify funding are not
rare. Take the recent case of US mayoral hopeful, Donald Mintz. He produced
and distrubited disgusting anti-Jewish leaflets and then appealed to the
Jewish community for campaign funds to fight the racists. In this case
a local reporter caught him in the act and dashed all hopes of being elected.</P>

<P>OXYGEN THERAPIES UNDER ATTACK IN THE UK</P>

<P>In Australia they're called the TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration);
in America they're called the FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration); and
in the UK they're called the MCA (Medicines Control Agency). But no matter
where they are or what they are called, they all have an agenda to restrict
public access to &quot;unauthorised&quot; health care treatments.</P>

<P>The British medical bureaucracy, like its counterpart in Australia and
the US has decided that the increasing number of success stories emerging
from the use of oxygen therapies has to stop.</P>

<P>In June of last year the Ministry of Health 'visited' the offices of
Echo UK, a non-profit oxygen therapies information centre involved only
in the dissemination of public domain literature. They had a warrant signed
by no less than the Minister of Health, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, giving
them authority to inspect all files and literature. Echo UK was informed
(incorrectly) that they were breaking the law by distributing some of the
information in their possession.</P>

<P>Pressure from the MCA and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain was also applied to Echo UK, all in an attempt to stop them from
distributing already publicly available information.</P>

<P>I suppose, though, the British should consider themselves lucky. I mean,
they only get polite gentlemen bearing a warrant to inspect files and literature,
while in the USA they send in an armed SWAT team with fully-loaded automatic
weapons and wearing flak jackets, who kick the door down, steal everything
and then trash the place while holding staff and patients at gunpoint against
the wall.</P>

<P>COLD WAR CON?</P>

<P>When presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush signed an agreement
in 1991 to take all Soviet and US nuclear bombers off alert and put the
warheads into storage, it was celebrated as a breakthrough.</P>

<P>But according to an item in the London Sunday Times, the two presidents
were merely formalising a secret 'arrangement' that had existed for decades.</P>

<P>The truth emerged when the deputy head of Russia's Strategic Air Force,
Major General Anatoli Solovyov, revealed that for safety reasons, &quot;we
never flew within nuclear weapons, inly with imitations&quot;.</P>

<P>Similarly, the US Strategic Bomber Fleet was largely grounded after
a couple of accidents in the 1960s. (Four nuclear weapons fell from a B-52
bomber off Palomares, Spain, in 1966; and in 1968, a B-52 crashed near
the Thule Air Force Base in Greenland with four nuclear bombs on board.)
After 1967, all the bombers in the US Strategic Fleet were grounded until
the end of the Cold War.</P>

<P>UN TREATIES - NEW WORLD ORDER BY STEALTH?</P>

<P>Australians are beginning to wake up to the fact that the Federal Government
has been very busy making Australia a co-signatory to literally thousands
of international treaties. United Nations treates, with irresistible names
such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),
are usually signed without as much as a whisper to the public for debate.</P>

<P>When Governor-General Bill Hayden signed the abovementioned ICCPR on
25th December 1991, he hadn't counted on the public uproar that would ensue.
Tens of thousands of people phoned and wrote to politicians complaining
that the bill was a defacto Bill of Rights being imposed upon all Australians
by an unelected faceless UN committee in another country.</P>

<P>The following December, the Governor General was asked to ratify a treaty
(ILO158) only hours before the dissolution of Parliament. No media release
was issued. There was no public debate.</P>

<P>The latest example of the effects of UN treateis upon Australian citizens'
rights is of course the homosexual rights issue in Tasmania. Here we have
an island state in a democracy where many of the people seem to want the
law to stay the way it is. However, it says in one of the several thousand
treaties we have signed that this law is not acceptable. It is a pity that
the Federal Government did not tell the people of Tasmania this when they
signed the treaty in the first place-or was that the general idea?</P>

<P>The following extract is worth reading in light of the above: 'The remarkable
growth of international laws had led countries including Australia to surrender
parts of their sovereignty to the world community, the former Governor-General
of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen, said last night.</P>

<P>Sir Ninian, chairman of the foundation examining Australia's Constitution,
said that international justice and peace would only come by adherence
to such laws, of which there are now over 50,000.</P>

<P>His views, expressed at the opening of the International Bar Association
converence in Melbourne, echoed those of former Prime Minister, Mr Goug
Whitlam.</P>

<P>Mr Whitlam said recently that it was crucial for Canberra to introduce
world standards such as United Nations and International Labour Organisation
and not be deterred by State's rights.</P>

<P>The 50,000 new international instuments, treaties and conventions formed
over the past few decades are administered by more than 2,000 new international
agencies and instrmentalities, said Sir Ninian.</P>

<P>&quot;The result has been in every country a plethora of new laws appearing
on the statute book, giving local effect ot newly assumed international
obligations,&quot; he said.</P>

<P>Countries have voluntarily surrendered parts of their sovereignty in
the cause of interdependence and cooperation.</P>

<P>&quot;It will surely only be by the extension of international law throughout
the nations and its universal observance that they (countries) will come
to live together at peace and in justice as one world communitiy.&quot;</P>

<P>NEW WORLD ORDER in the U.S.A.</P>

<P>Written By The P/\NTHER -UMF/TRSi-</P>

<P>This country is just one step away from total disarmament and a One-World
police-controlled Economic Government!</P>

<P>The Civil War, WW I, WW II, the Korean Conflict, VietNam, Desert Storm,
the Randy Weaver incident, the Waco situation, Somalia, Bosnia, etc. were
purposely imposed on the peoples of the world to condition them to be controlled
by a few self-appointed rulers.</P>

<P>In 1913, the U.S. Congress relinquished its responsibility regarding
our money system by allowing the &quot;private&quot; Federal Reserve System
to be established and controlled by the Illuminati (the hidden government
consisting of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission
and the Bilderbergers, which are headed up by the Rockefellers in the United
States and by the Rothschilds of Europe) and its &quot;stockholders.&quot;
(Trilateralism is international economic regionalism dealing with INTERdependence,
and not a final goal. It is a precursor to the one-world government being
planned for humanity by the international cartelists vain enough to think
they are destined to rule over a slave humanity, despite the wishes and
rights of mankind.)</P>

<P>Also, in 1913, the Congress allowed the Internal Revenue Service (Title
26) to operate under the &quot;color of law.&quot; Title 26 has never been
enacted into law by Congress.</P>

<P>In 1921, the CFR saw its birth, to be joined soon thereafter by the
TC - both Rockefeller institutions and headquartered in New York as is
the United Nations.</P>

<P>In 1945, the United States, through constant promoting from the U.S.
State Department, signed the United Nations Charter, overriding our U.S.
Constitution and Bill of Rights.</P>

<P>In 1961, the former President Nixon signed Executive Order 11647 (precursor
towards acceptance of NAFTA a Treaty). This E.O. divided the U.S. into
ten federal regions to be run by &quot;Federal Regional Councils&quot;
(over 18 states have since rejected Regionalism, but who is listening?).
(School children are being groomed to accept Regional Government - look
at the back of the small KIX Cereal box at your local grocery stores.)</P>

<P>The lines drawn for these federal regions cross State lines, thus obliterating
the sovereignty of the States. Article IV, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution
declares:</P>

<P>&quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union
a republican form of government...&quot;</P>

<P>A republican form of government is defined in Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary as one in which &quot;the sovereign power resides in a certain
body of the people--the electorate--and is exercised by representatives
elected by, and responsible to, them.&quot;</P>

<P>Under the Federal Regional Councils proclaimed by President Nixon, government
in the ten federal regions would be administered by federal-appointed bureaucrats
accountable only to Washington, D.C. Nixon's actions are a clear violation
of the U.S. Constitution, Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1, which stipulates:</P>

<P>&quot;New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but
no new STate shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other State, nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States,
or parts of States, without the consent of the Legislatures of the States
concerned as well as of the Congress.&quot;</P>

<P>Nixon did not obtain the consent of all the State Legislatures concerned,
nor of Congress. At the time of signing E.O. 11647, Nixon included the
Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). The LEAA is becoming
increasingly involved in dishing out taxpayers' dollars to finance programs
of merger, consolidation and regionalization of local police forces. (When
a national police force becomes a recognized, accepted, operating reality,
it will no longer be ineffective and permissive; it will be ruthlessly
efficient and repressive.)</P>

<P>Establishment of LEAA is a crucial first step to a national police force.
President Clinton recently announced he is making $22 billion available
to upgrade all states' police forces (with a few more prisons thrown in
for good measure); there are strings attached to it - any time the federal
government has an input, it controls.</P>

<P>The &quot;hidden&quot; government (CFR/TC/Bilderbergers, etc) to which
nearly all State Department officials belong, as well as many other appointed
and elected positions of our government (to include Congressmen and Senators),
is using the Communist technique of discrediting the local police in the
eyes of the people. A national police force with unlimited powers is one
of the most important characteristics of a totalitarian dictatorship. The
plot against local control of the police has been in the making for some
time. A national police force would take from the States the responsibility
of enforcing laws that should remain in their jurisdiction. Law-abiding
citizens and local officials should vigorously oppose concerted attacks
against local law enforcement and the devious moves to negate local authority
and replace it with federal police power. There are many SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL
POLICE COMMITTEES operating throughout the country. With the passing of
the Brady Gun Bill, another step towards total disarmament and elimination
of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
If the American people permit a national police force to be established,
no citizen will be permitted to have a gun in his possession to defend
himself and his family against this planned tyranny. The Brady Gun Bill
becomes &quot;law&quot; 90 days after its signing - so come March 1994,
or even before, more stringent gun control bills will either be signed
into law or on the drawing board. Those communities know to encourage at
least one gun ownership per household have far less crime. Statistics prove
gun control increases crime - criminals become more arrogant, they know
our present justice system is &quot;soft&quot; on them; it is the law-abiding
citizen who is prosecuted/persecuted.</P>

<P>In between all the above actions to dissolve America, the presidents
have instituted Executive Orders which give one man, the president, total
control over all our lives in these United States of America!</P>

<P>In 1984, former President Reagan conditionally agreed to Total Disarmament
of the United States of America which would automatically include Total
Gun Confiscation - private citizens especially !</P>

<P>In 1989, 400 Congressmen signed into law P.L. 101-216, which reinforces
P.L. 87-297 and State Department Document #7277. (Approximately 33 California
Congressmen signed this P.L. - those still holding public office include:
Paneta, Boxer, Dellums, Beilenson, Berman, Dornan, Dreier, Thomas, Fazio,
Lantos, Lehman, Matsui, McCandless, Mineta, Moorhead, Packard, Pelosi,
J. Lewis, Stark, Rohrabacher, Torres, Waxman and others - and former Cong.
Dannemeyer who hopes to unseat Senator Feinstein in 1994.)</P>

<P>In 1994 the Crime Control Act was passed (which will further remove
many of our freedoms and inalienable rights under the U.S. Constitution
and Bill of Rights), the National Health Care Act (Socialized Medicine,
which will impose additional restrictions on the people), Goals 200 (total
control of our children, through Federal Government schools), etc. All
of these &quot;programs&quot; will impose additional taxes on the general
public.</P>

<P>The National Education Association (NEA) is listed as a participating
organization in the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. The NEA's chief
commitment is to promote a planned society which will train children to
disregard the traditional values of their parents, preparing them to adjust
to, and support, growing collectivism. The NEA is a tax-exempt organization
-- meaning that you help pay for its programs, to include your own disarmament.</P>

<P>Emerging throughout our nation is the Fully Informed Jury ASsociation
whose doctrine is to insure &quot;fully informed jurists&quot; in our court
rooms 0 many judges prohibit proper indoctrination of juries.</P>

<P>Every step the U.S. takes toward political and economic entanglements
with the rest of the world is a step toward realization of the end object
of the CFR, the TC, the Bilderbergers, etc., which is to create a one-world
socialist, political and economic system in which we (the U.S.) will be
one of the subjugated provinces. So, now we have the illegally passed NAFTA;
read Article II, Sec. 2, Para. 2 of the U.S. Constitution.</P>

<P>World government would seriously impair if not totally destroy the national
sovereignty of the United States of America. Loss of a national sovereignty
means not only the loss of the power to control the destiny of a nation,
it also means the loss of the rights of the individual citizens in that
nation. One of the direct links between the CFR and the &quot;big business&quot;
community is the Committee for Economic Development (CED). The CFR is geared
to control our foreign policy (which it has been doing since its inception
in 1921, regardless of what party represents the White House); the CED
concerns itself with domestic policy of this country. It is the #1 priority
of the CFR and CED to nullify the power of the individual States, leaving
them at the mercy of the all-powerful federal government, a government
controlled by men belonging to the CFR and the CED (as well as the Trilateral
Commission and the Bilderberger Group).</P>

<P>The Rockefellers have been working for five decades to control the American
government so they can dominate our economy...</P>

<P>The Rockefeller game plan is to consolidate control over the world's
economies by merging all the nations of the world under a single Rockefeller/Rothschild-controlled
tent. Such a government would have to be a dictatorship, ruled by Rockefeller
and Rothschild puppets or by the Communist-Third World bloc. It was Rockefeller
money (9$ million) that paid for the ground on which the United Nations
stands. It is Rockefeller money and the money of the many (over 1600) tax-exempt
Foundations (to include Ford and Carnegie) that bankroll this nation's
dash into One-Worldly/Feudalism.</P>

<P>It looks like it could be too late to fight such an awesome network
of power. But then again Information is the weapon THEY are afraid of.
</P>

<P>&quot;Keep your eyes &amp; ears open &amp; your mouth shut &amp; you'll
learn something.&quot;</P>

<P>MOONGATE : Chapter 10</P>

<P>Evidence of Extraterrestrial interference in the space program.</P>

<P>The UFO subject has been abused by many writers who produce books about
UFOs with seemingly little thought or hard analysis. Hopefully, information
contained in the remainder of this book will help explain certain aspects
of the UFO enigma in a more logical manner. This requires a better understanding
of how the universe functions and man's position in it. Every phenomenon
must have a rational basis, regardless of how bizarre it may seem to be.
In every case, the law of cause and effect must hold. If NASA fabricated
information, it will show up as a fabrication when it contradicts other
valid occurrences. The sum total of all phenomena must boil down to the
real picture of what happened.</P>

<P>Logic dictates that if UFOs occupied by intelligent beings are close
by, they must have a purpose in being here. If these beings are around,
actions taken by Earth people will probably be closely monitored by them.
The human beings who live on the outer surface of the Earth have an extremely
bad reputation for being killers. Historians can rationalize the wars based
on this or that reason; however, from the standponit of advanced civilizations
which are not part of the outer Earth world, the Earth's history would
be appalling. How could UFO occupants trust Earth nations to be benevolent
when these nations have such war-filled histories and are developing weapons
which are more and more powerful?</P>

<P>A great deal of information exists about Earth people who claim to have
been contacted by &quot;space&quot; people. Many of these contactees have
allegedly been told that the Earth is being carefully monitored. The primary
reason given for the monitoring is so that they will be able to quickly
curtail a nuclear war should it begin. If this is true, then missiles and
spacecraft would be closely observed to ensure that they carried no nuclear
warheads and did no damage to the EArth or Moon. Therefore, if UFO encounters
or sightings were made byt he astronauts, it should come as no surprise.
This would be especially true during the Apollo missions if these people
are stationed on the Moon. The present discussion will focus on the evidence
of extraterrestrials inadvertently supplied by NASA and other lunar observers.
Contactee encounters will be discussed in the next chapter.</P>

<P>Centuries ago, lunar observers noted transient phenomena which could
not be easily attributed to natural causes. For example, small dome-like
upswellings have appeared and disappeared on the Moon. In 1788, the astronomer
Schroeter attributed these domes to the industrial activities of the Selenite
(Moon) people. (1) Naturally, he was not taken seriously. However, over
200 of these white, circular domes have been observed and catalogued in
current times. (2) These hemispheres have varied in diameter between an
eighth and a quarter of a mile, with an average of one-quarter; and between
20 and 30 of them of similar size were seen clustered on the floor of Tycho
Crater. (3) These particular domes can not be attributed solely to rounded
hills or volcanic upswellings. Their unpredictable appearance and disappearance
indicates that they are intelligently created and movable structures.</P>

<P>Schroeter saw a shadow in the lunar Alps in 1788. (4) At first he saw
a light, but after the region had been illuminated, a round shadow appeared
where the light had been. Since the shadow was round, the object which
produced it was detached and above the lunar surface. After 15 minutes,
is supposedly disappeared. It is possible that Schroeter saw a large aerial
object which provided the illumination to create its own shadow. Many bright,
round spots have also been sighted inside craters such as Plato and the
Sea of Crisis. They frequently appear dome-like and change their brightness
from night to night. (5)</P>

<P>George Leonard supplied photographic evidence that the Moon is being
worked with massive machines in his book, Somebody Else Is on the Moon.
He suggested that damage done to the Moon's surface at one time is slowly
being repaired. He claims to have photographic evidence which shows craters
being worked on and perhaps mined. It is now known that the Moon is rich
in valuable elements which could be used for many purposes.</P>

<P>The evidence of extraterrestrial monitoring of the space program apparently
began with the Mercury missions and continued through Apollo 17. During
Cooper's fourth orbit over Hawaii in 1963, he heard a weird voice transmission
in an unintelligible language. The tapes were later analyzed and it was
determined that the sounds were not those of any known foreign language
on the Earth. (6) On the final orbit near Australia, he sighted a UFO from
the space capsule. (7) It was also allegedly seen by over 200 people at
the tracking station. (8)</P>

<P>Supposedly one or more UFOs were seen on each of the 12 Gemini missions.
After the 1966 Gemini 9 mission was scrubbed due to interference with the
radio hookup, NASA released a statement on television that UFOs or unknowns
had been seen by astronauts on several occasions. (9)</P>

<P>White and McDivitt saw and photographed an eggshaped, glowing, silvery
object which moved above and below them. Five frames with a movie camera
were taken as it flew by, and the film shows an egg-shaped object with
a fan-like glow and a long tail of light. The Mission Control report stated
that Command Pilot Jim McDivitt reported seeing another object in space
which appeared to have big arms sticking out. The report also indicated
that he took some motion pictures of the object, but had difficulty because
of the Sun. (10)</P>

<P>It is significant that Gemini 7 encountered a UFO and many little particles
traveling by the space capsule. The silvery UFO was not the rocket booster
because it was seen in addition to the UFO. (11) NASA commonly attributed
the particles observed in other missions to urine droplets or paint fragments
peeling off the spacecraft.</P>

<P>John Glen was the first astronaut to discover the &quot;fireflies&quot;
which were observed quite frequently throughout the space program. After
he had moved out of the night side of his first orbit, he glanced back
through the window and thought that the spacecraft had tumbled because
he saw &quot;stars.&quot; Glenn soon realized that the spacecraft had not
tumbled and that he was surrounded by yellowish-green, luminous particles
which looked like &quot;fireflies.&quot; They appeared to vary in size
between a pinhead and three-eights of an inch and were eight to ten feet
apart, evely distributed through the space around the capsule. Each time
the Sun came up, he observed these particles for about four minutes. Glenn
stated the following about them:</P>

<P>&quot;During the third sunrise I turned the spacecraft around and faced
forward to see if I could determine where the particles were coming from.
Facing forwards I could see only about ten percent as many particles as
I had when my back was to the sun. Still, they seemed to be coming toward
me from some distance so that they appeared not to be coming from the spacecraft.
Just what these particles are is stil subject to debate and awaits further
clarification.&quot; (12)</P>

<P>In spite of Glenn's clear statement that these particles did not come
from the spacecraft, orthodox authorities atributed them to flakes of material
coming off the capsule.</P>

<P>Although more UFO sightings could be reference involving the Gemini
missions, the most valuable information came from the Apollo flights. In
going around the Moon, Apollo 8 astronauts supposedly sighted a &quot;disc-shaped&quot;
object, experienced a &quot;blinding light&quot;, and herd &quot;intolerably
high-frequency noises&quot; from their radio. (13) Later, they sighted
the object again with more of the brilliant light and experienced &quot;a
wave of internal heat within the space capsule.&quot; (14) The spacecraft
supposedly began to &quot;pitch and yaw&quot; before control was regained.
(15) It is also significant that when the astronauts came around theeastern
edge of the Moon, all the water in a radiator in the spacecraft's cooling
system had evaporated and had to be replenished! (16)</P>

<P>According to official accounts, Apollo 10 had a close call when Cernan
and Stafford descended to within 50,000 feet of the lunar surface to inspect
the APollo 11 landing site. It seems that after the descent stage was jettisoned,
the upper stage went into a wild spin, pitching up and down. Something
caused the gyro-guidance system to go out of control, and to steady the
ship, Stafford took over the hand controls. Supposedly, a control switch
had beee left in the wrong position by technicians and was not spotted
by Stafford. However, official accounts do not mention that a UFO rose
vertically from below and that it was photographed. (17)</P>

<P>The first Apollo 11 UFO encounter occurred one day into the flight.
The astronauts sighted an unknown which appeared between them and the Moon
which might have been the booster rocket. In the debriefing, Aldrin stated
that they recalled having trouble with the high gain at about the same
time as the sighting. Coolins mentioned that they felt a bump and Armstrong
indicated that Collins thought the MESA (Modularized Equipment Stowage
Assembly) had come off. Aldrin then recalled seeing all sorts of little
objects going by prior to seeing the brighter object which had an L-shape
to it. Armstrong compared it to two connected rings, but Aldrin disagreed
and described it as a hollow cylinder. Collins re-entered the conversation
and asserted that it looked like a hollow cylinder which was tumbling,
but would change to an open-book shape. (18)</P>

<P>There are some significant items of information in the above conversation.
First of all, Aldrin stated that they wer having a problem with the high
gain about the time of the sighting. Collins mentioned that they felt a
bump, but then decided against this idea after Armstrong commented on the
MESA package. As the dialogue progresed, the astronauts began talking about
the shape of the object. It seems that these three, trained observers could
not or would not agree on what they saw. Each man seemed to have a picture
of what it was, yet after Collins explicitly described it as a cylinder,
Aldrin stated that it was not a cylinder. Armstrong said that it looked
like two connected rings.</P>

<P>When Apollo 11 was near the Moon, weird radio noises were heard which
sounded like fire engines, sirens, buxx-saws, and train whistles. Mission
Control supposedly asked if someone else was up there with them. These
signals or noises came from outside the spacecraft and also allegedly persisted
intermittently throughout the first few days of the flight. (19)</P>

<P>According to one undisclosed source, after Armstrong and Aldrin landed
on the Moon, immense UFOs lined up on the far side of the crater and monitored
the astronauts. (20) Another reference to this event appeared in the National
Enquirer, September 11, 1979. (21) In the story, a formber consultant to
NASA claims that the event occurred but was covered up. According to the
article, the encounter was common knowledge in NASA.</P>

<P>The reader is reminded that some of this information is limited and
perhaps questionable concerning the subject matter of NASA UFO sightings.
If the accounts were evaluated solely on their own, the case would not
be totally proven by any means. However, in conjunction with all of the
evidence which remains, and all that has been presented prior to this,
the incidents are more believable.</P>

<P>Apollo 12 nearly experienced a complete electrical shutdown shortly
after take-off. The ship appeared to be hit by bolts of lighting 36 1/2
and 52 seconds after launch; but since there was no thunderstorm in teh
area, the event had to be explained from another standpoint. Some people
speculated that the rocket created an electrical conductor to ground from
the ionized exhaust and that lighting discharged through the ship. However,
one source claims that observatories in Europe reported two unknown objects
in the craft's vicinity as it headed toward the Moon. (22) One object appeared
to be following Apollo 12 and the other was ahead of it. Both were blinking
on and off rapidly. The following day the astronauts reported two UFOs
or bogeys about 132,000 miles out, and during their conversations with
Mission Control, one of the objects flew off at high speed. (23) As allegedly
received by Ground Control which did not come from the space capsule but
from elsewhere. The noise was also supposedly heard by the atronauts and
was described as static, whistles, and a constant beeping sound. (24)</P>

<P>The subject of fireflies has been mentioned several times. When the
Apollo 16 astronauts were coasting towards the Moon, they entered a region
of space swarming with these particles. However, NASA insists that they
were flakes of paint which was applied to keep the craft from overheating
in the Sun. But again, accompanying this occurrence, Mattingly reported
that problems had arisen with the guidance and navigation systems. There
was no attitude indication and the gimbal platform had locked. A manual
realighment became necessary and the &quot;snowflakes&quot; traveling with
the ship interfered with the star sightings. Typically, no one determined
what happened; they merely suggested that another &quot;electronic glitch&quot;
had occurrec. Somehow, electrical transients were created in the electrical
circuitry which created temporary malfunctions which later disappeared.
Before the Apollo 16 descent, another bad circuit in the steering system
controlling the main rocket engine occurred. This caused the engine bell
to oscillate sideways. (25)</P>

<P>It appears that electronic glitches, UFO sightings, and luminous particles
may be related phenomena. An examination of this relationship provides
a great deal of information about what may have really happened to the
astronauts. John Glenn saw luminous particles for about four minutes during
every orbit when coming into the Sun. He clearly stated that they came
toward the capsule from a distance. Glenn may have been observing the disintegration
of certain particles which are emited continuously by the Sun. Accumulated
evidence indicates that they fill the space between planets and galazies,
and that their constituent particles probably consist of photons of light.
When these particles disintegrate, photons are released. The nature of
these particles may be intimately connected with the energies used to propel
the UFOs which were allegedly seen by some of the astronauts. When UFOs
came in close proximity to the NASA spacecraft, the concentration of these
&quot;firefly&quot; particles may have increased tremendously. The particles
seem to carry and electrical charge and penetrate readily through the material
of a spacecraft. If they disintegrate when interacting with matter and
other particles in space, the astronauts would see them inside and outside
their ships. The effect of these particles on the spacecraft would be to
cause overloading of electrical systems and electronic noise in the radio
communication circuits. Since they may be emitted in high concentrations
by UFOs, objects in the vicinity would be bathed in them sufficiently to
cause the overloads and short-circuiting. For example, Apollo 10's guidance
system could have been short-circuited by these particles from an approaching
UFO.</P>

<P>The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor</P>

<P>(A Case Study In Police State Tactics In America)</P>

<P>On Monday, April 18, 1993 the U.S. government, in an act of mass murder
unrivaled in U.S. history (intended to send a warning to gun owners and
so-called &quot;religious nuts&quot; across the country), burned 86 people,
including 24 children to death in the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,
Texas - climaxing a 51 day seige launched by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms, (BATF) on February 28, 1993. As editorialist Charley Reese
recently wrote: &quot;When you start with an &quot;allegation&quot; that
a gun control law has been violated, and you end up with nearly 100 people,
including 25 children, killed, and millions of taxpayers dollars down the
drain, that's bad law enforcement no matter how you slice it.&quot;</P>

<P>Koresh and his followers held no hostages, had committed no violent
crimes, were not threatening to kill or harm anyone. They were minding
their own business on their own property. Everyone in the compound was
there of their own free will. Texas social workers had been in the compound
and found no indication that any outsider who visited the compound would
be in any danger. One of the children living in the compound told her father,
according to him, that &quot;it was a joy to live there.&quot;</P>

<P>A massive coverup by the Clintonistas, the FBI, the BATF, and the Establishment-controlled
media has pacified the great majority of the American public in spite of
the worst massacre of men, women and children by our government in U.S.
history. President Clinton and the Establishment's message in the aftermath
was clear: Let this be a warning to religious misfits, dissidents, gun
regulations violators, Constitutionalists., and traditionalists: Get in
our way, oppose us, or thumb your nose at us and we will destroy you -
by fire if necessary.</P>

<P>What a horror to watch men, women and children burned to death for no
other crime than resisting the omnipotent state. It is a chilling example
of the police state that is emerging in American with ominous parallels
to Nazi Germany, which &quot;coincidentally&quot; massacred hundreds of
Jews in the Warsaw ghetto exactly 50 years earlier on April 19, 1943. Gun
control, people control, persecution of religious minorities, and incredible
ruthlessness and wickedness were all part of the Third Reich in Germany
and are part of the Fourth Reich emerging in America today.</P>

<P>The Branch Davidians were not the first (nor will they be the last)
group the BATF has attacked for &quot;alleged&quot; gun control violations.
Last year alone, the BATF raided over 2,000 homes or businesses with a
number of innocent victims killed, and tens of millions in assets seized
and hundreds of Americans jailed, in their quest for the Holy Grail called
gun control.</P>

<P>And it should be realized that this gestapo-like organization did not
just arrive with Bill Clinton. It came on stream in 1968 with the Gun Control
Act of 1968 and has been growing in power and in its attacks on the American
people ever since.</P>

<P>As syndicated columnist Paul Craig Roberts noted: &quot;the tragedy
near Waco happened precisely because of federal laws regulating gun ownership.
T he Branch Davidians hadn't assaulted anyone. They lived peacefully in
the community. Except for federal gun laws they would all still be alive.
It is the liberal premise that gun ownership is evil, should be illegal
or at least heavily regulated, and that has created an atmoshpere in which
the BATF like an unthinking bully, can run roughshod over Americans' constitutional
rights, due process, and freedom.&quot; [ED NOTE: And as the gun control
legislation described above passes, BATF attacks on honest law-abiding
gun owners are likely to grow 10-fold!]</P>

<P>It is obvious that the government (and the BATF) wanted a highly publicized
&quot;victory&quot; over gun owners and &quot;religious nuts,&quot; and
thanks to the whitewashing and coverup by the Administration and the media,
the American people have by-and-large slept through the most unspeakable
slaughter of innocents in U.S. history. In spite of all the mess-ups, the
government has its victory, gun owners and religious groups across America
now live in fear of similar treatment at the hands of Clinton's Gestapo,
and the momentum toward gun control, toward persecution of Christians and
other minority religious groups, traditionalists, and Constitutionalists,
and towards a socialist America and the New World Order continues to accelerate.</P>

<P>If the inhabitants of Mt. Carmel had been dangerous terrorists, drug
dealers, or enemies on the battlefield, the government attack could not
have been more brutal.</P>

<P>After the initial attack (02/28/93) Former McClennon County Texas District
Attorney Vic Feazell blamed the BATF for the deadly confrontation, accusing
them of &quot;a vulgar display of power&quot;.</P>

<P>In 1987, Feazell helped lead an investigation of the Davidians and their
firearms, in which they wer completely exonerated from any illegal activity.
&quot;We treated them like human beings rather than stormtrooping the place.&quot;</P>

<P>Likewise, Jack Harwell, the McClennon County SHeriff, called Koresh
on the telephone and informed him of the charges, and asked him to turn
himself in, along with six others and surrender their weapons. When deputies
arrived at the Church grounds, Koresh and the other Davidian members peacefully
complied. Feazell said of the Davidians, &quot;They're protective of what's
theirs. They're protective of their land. They view their land as Muslims
to Mecca and Jews view Jerusalem...if they'd (the BATF) called and talked
to them, the Davidians would've given them what they wanted.&quot;</P>

<P>Feazell's view of the BATF blundering has been seconded by anti-terrorists
expert Col. Charlie Beckwith, the founder of the U.S. Army's Dellta Force
Commando unit. He has told reporters the BATF raid was an &quot;embarrassment&quot;
Beckwith faulted the plan implemented by the VATF, saying the intelligence
behind it was responsible for the disaster.</P>

<P>Subsequent to the first BATF attack Feazell predicted that the government
would kill all the Davidians, and after the massacre (the second attack)
he said that they intended to kill these people from the beginning to cover
the tracks of their own crimes they committed by raiding the compound to
begin with.</P>

<P>After the original public relations disaster on 2/28, the government
strategy seems to have evolved over the next 51 days as follows:</P>

<P>First, through a massive media discrediting of the Davidians through
the &quot;party line&quot; press over several weeks.</P>

<P>Second, by slowly preparing the public to believe that all of the people
remaining in the compound were under the total control of an unpredictable
psychopath, and to expect a mass suicide, yet saying that there was no
reason for them to believe that Koresh would carry out a mass suicide.</P>

<P>Third, to cloak their act in righteousness (as tyranny always does)
by saying their efforst on Monday were to force the people out by using
non-lethal CS gas &quot;for the sake of the children.&quot;</P>

<P>USING CS GAS ON CHILDREN-President Clinton, Janet Reno, and their FBI/BATF
employees have described CS gas as &quot;a harmless tear has, an irritant,
designed to cause the mothers to grab their children and run out of the
building.&quot; No one in the police or military who has ever used CS gas
believes this. CS gas (O-chlorobenzylidene malonitrate) has been banned
as a chemical warfare battlefield agent by the Chemical Weapons COnvention
signed in Paris in January by the U.S. and over 130 other nations. Used
during the Nietnam War to flush Vietcong from hidden tunnels, the gas causes
dizziness, disorientation, shortness of breath, chest tightness, nausea,
burning of the sking, intense tearing, temporary blindness, coughing, and
vomiting-in short it is designed to blind and disable (very different from
&quot;relatively harmless&quot;). CS gas is a battlefield incapacitating
gas.</P>

<P>On March 10, The Houston Chronicle reported that former Houston police
SWAT commander Lt. Jim Gunn said that &quot;CS gas can get into a child's
lungs and cause congestion and kill them.&quot; Benjamin C. Garrett, executive
director of teh Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute in Alexandria,
VA said in the Washington Times (4/23/93) that: &quot;the CS would have
most harshly affected the children in the compound. The reaction would
have intensified for the children since the smaller you are, the sooner
you would feel response.&quot; It is important to note that the children
did not have gas masks (they were too small to wear them).</P>

<P>Beth Stephens, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a
public interest law firm based in New York, said &quot;tests have documented
at least 80 deaths caused by exposure to CS gas. Tests have found that
CS is a toxic substance which is highly dangerous to people who inhale
its fumes, particularly when in confined areas.&quot; CS was pumped into
the Mt. Carmel compound (an enclosed area) for six hours before the facility
caught fire and burned to the ground.</P>

<P>The Washington Times (4/22/93) wrote: &quot;'The powerful chemical teh
FBI used at the Branch Davidian compound would have turned the cult children's
last moments into a final hell,' chemical experts said yesterday. 'It would
have panicked the children whose eyes would have involuntarily shut. Their
throats and lungs would have been blurning. They would have been coughing
wildly,' said Benjamin Garrett. ' Eventually they would have been vomiting
in a final hell'&quot; [ED NOTE: THis is the gas CLinton, Reno, and their
underlings described as a &quot;harmless irritant.&quot;]</P>

<P>This writer has talked to a half dozen special forces, military, and
police personnel who all agree that CS is a highly toxic battlefield immobilization
gas. &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz told this writer that: &quot;CS gas is not just
an irritant; it is designed to knock you down and makes you incapable of
any practicle functions.&quot; That our government would use it on women
and children (thereby immobilizing them and preventing them from running
from the building) is creul, inhuman, and unspeakable evil and is the kind
of thing the Nazis and Communists would have relished in..</P>

<P>THE GOVERNMENT COVERUP: OPERATION DAMAGE CONTROL (OR WHITE WASH) The
U.S. government has refined the art of political coverup to a science.
They have had practice: 1) The POW/MIA Coverup after World War II, Korea,
and Vietnam whereby thousands of American POWs and servicement were left
in the hands of the communists; 2) The Kennedy Assassinations (John and
Bobby) Coverup which is now in its 31st year; 3) The Watergate Coverup
which ultimately backfired on Nixon and Company; 4) The AIDS Coverup presently
being perpetrated by the government (and particularly the CDC) to hide
the extent and magnitude of the AIDS crisis; and, now, 5) The Waco Massacre
Coverup.</P>

<P>a) BURNING AND BULLDOZING THE EVIDENCE: The BATF (and other government
agencies) love to burn, bulldoze or cremate the evidence. In the Weaver
case, the government tried to burn out the Weaver cabin by dumping fuel
on the cabin via helicopter and only an alert reporter waving a camera
in the air saved the surviving Weavers from the same fate as the Branch
Davidians. Shortly after Randy Weaver, Kevin Harris and the three Weaver
girls came out of the cabin, the BATF and FBI grabbed the bodies of Vicki
and Sam Weaver and had them cremated. Therefore, no trial evidence from
autopsies. (Sam Weaver, age 14, was shot several times in the back by the
marshals, Vicki in the head by an FBI sniper).</P>

<P>In Waco, on April 19, crucial physical evidence and key witnesses were
consumed by fire. Then on May 12, FBI officials, citing the fear that someone
might fall in the bunker (though the entire site was fenced and guarded),
and a need to fill holes and cover trash and raw sewage for safety and
health reasons, rolled bulldozers across the burned out compound completely
obliterating any remaining evidence.</P>

<P>b) SILENCING BATF AND FBI AGENTS - Shortly after the original BATF attack,
two agents came forward on TV in New York (though their faces were not
shown) and said they were afraid of a coverup. All BATF agents have already
been threatened by the Washington office of BATF with the possiblity of
being punished, dismissed, or prosecuted for speaking publicaly about the
raid. The agency is struggling to keep these agents silent. Four of their
comrades died because of bungling, malfeasance, and mendacity at the top
of the BATF.</P>

<P>c) THE SO CALLED &quot;INDEPENDENT&quot; ARSON TEAM HAD CLOSE TIES WITH
THE BATF The Clintonistas, immediately after the fire, suggested an &quot;independent&quot;
investigation to investigate the burned out Branch Davidian compound site
and confirm the &quot;truth.&quot; That &quot;independent&quot; investigator,
who claimed the fire had been set by the Davidians (based, he said, on
infrared photos taken from a helicopter) was employee (who had been on
a joint BATF task force for 10 years) and long time contractor for the
FBI, whose wife is personal secretary to the head of the Houston BATF -
where the whole raid was planned. The FBI controlled the crime scene for
three weeks following the holocaust, letting no Texas Rangers, local police
or truly independent arson investigators in, and then bulldozed the entire
site on May 12. (So, now, no one else can investigate the burnt out compound.)</P>

<P>d) THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT INVESTIGATE THE DECISIONS FOR THE
FINAL ASSAULT - Although Bill Clinton promised a &quot;vigorous and through&quot;
investigation of the handling of the entire Waco affair, on May 15 the
Justice Department said it would not investigate the decision making process
associated with the final assault. (This is like saying in a murder case
we will not investigate who pulled the trigger or who gave the order to
pull the ttrigger, or in Watergate, not investigating who gave the order
for the Watergate breakin). As the New York Times (5/16/93) said: &quot;Clinton
officials said that since Ms. Reno has been widely supported in Congress,
and since polls show that the majority of Americans supported her decision
to use tear gas, and blame the cult members themselves for the final deadly
fire, department officials concluded that nothing could be gained by looking
more closely at her order to carry out the assault.&quot;</P>

<P>e) LIES THE GOVERNMENT TOLD DURING AND AFTER OPERATION WACO - &quot;Governments
are constituted to lie to the greatest number of people the greater part
of the time.&quot; Machiavelli, in The Prince. BATF, FBI, and Clinton Administration
officials have consistently lied and contradicted themselves since the
siege of Mt. Carmel began. Just a few of a growing list of the lies include:</P>

<P>1. The media was told the day before the raid (2/27) to get ready for
a big blowout and to get their TV cameras in place. The BATF originally
denied it told the media, but later admitted that it had..</P>

<P>2. The BATF said that Koresh had to be arrested at the compound because
he had not left it for several months. Numerous people in the area said
that was a lie and that they had frequently seen him out jogging, at the
store, and in town until shortly before the attack. The BATF finally admitted
they knew nothing about Koresh's movement because they NEVER even put him
under surveillance, let alone did they try to arrest him.</P>

<P>3. The BATF originally said that they had an arrest warrant for Koresh
and a search warrant for the compound. Later it was shown that they only
had a search warrant and no arrest warrant.</P>

<P>4. The BATF said that the element of surprise was the key to success
and that they wouldn't have attacked if they had known that the Branch
Davidians were expecting them. This was a lie. Everyone in town, including
the Branch Davidians, knew about hte coming attack. They moved a whole
army of men and equipment up to the compound. Later BATF director Higgins
admitted that they knew they had lost the element of surprise and went
ahead with the attack anyway. That decision caused the death of four BATF
agents.</P>

<P>5. The BATF told the Texas National Guard (in order to obtain use of
their helicopters), that there was an illegal drug lab at the compound.
There was no evidence of this before, during, or after the raid according
to the WACO Tribune-Herald (03/28/93).</P>

<P>6. On March 6, FBI officers denied that they had any plans to use psychological
warfare techniques against the Branch Davidians (i.e., such as loud rock
music, bright lights, weird sounds[animals being slaughtered]). The FBI
used them constantly throughout the seige.</P>

<P>7. In his press conference the evening of the fire, Bill Clinton said
Janet Reno had acted &quot;because of the children&quot; who were &quot;being
abused.&quot; Later, officials admitted that there was no evidence of child
abuse.</P>

<P>8. On March 2, the FBI's Bob Ricks told reporters that when the FBI
approached Koresh, he was going to go outside with grenades (in front of
the TV cameras), pull the pin, commit suicide and take as many agents with
him as he could. On 4/20 on MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour FBI Director William
Sessions said that all fo the FBI analysis of Koresh indicated that he
would NEVER commit suicide.</P>

<P>9. On April 28, FBI Deputy Director Floyd Clarke told the House Judiciary
Committee that the &quot;Branch Davidians had used their own children as
human shields by holding them up in front of the windows.&quot; The truth
is, the Branch Davidians hoisted their children up to the windows to see
the M1-A1 Abrams battle tanks sitting in their front yard, as FBI spokesman
Richard Swensen later admitted.</P>

<P>10. BATF Director Stephen Higgins testified before a Senate subcommittee
(04/02/93) that the BATF mission failed only &quot;because the Branch Davidians
ambushed the BATF.&quot; This is a lie. The BATF attacked the Branch Davidians
and not the other way arround. (Video Footage Clearly Shows this).</P>

<P>11. The FBI and Janet Reno stated repeatedly that the reason they attacked
the compound on April 19 was &quot;concern for the safety and well being
of the children&quot; This was a lie! You don't ram into buildings with
military tanks and pump CS gas ( a gas so deadly and debilitating that
it has been banned by international treaty for use in warfare) into a building
filled with women and children.&quot;</P>

<P>12. CS gas was described by Clinton, Reno and FBI officials as a harmless
(irritant) tear gas. This is a lie. It is 80 times stronger than tear gas,
immobilizes its victims and throws them into violent coughing and convulsions
(i.e. the &quot;perfect&quot; weapon for a police state to use against
young women &amp; children).</P>

<P>13. Clinton said on 04/20/93 that CS was a &quot;tear gas which had
been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or children.&quot;
That is a lie. (See Above)</P>

<P>14. The government said they had exhausted all avenues to resolve the
standoff. This is a lie. They refused to let any of the family members
speak with the Branch Davidians even though this has helped to resolve
many such former standoffs. They refused to let &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz and
Jack McLamb, who negotiated Randy Weaver and his family out last August,
assist, although they volunteered numerous times.</P>

<P>15. The BATF said after the February 28 fiasco that &quot;we were outgunned..&quot;
Another lie. They had helicopter gunships, armored vehicles, and fully
automatic weapons to use against the Branch Davidians, not to mention stun
grenades and the military's most high tech equipment.</P>

<P>16. George Stephanopoulos said: &quot;The children were being abused,
even to instruction on how to clamp down on cyanide pills.&quot; Though
this makes for chilling headlines, the FBI has denied that this was true.</P>

<P>17. On April 19, FBI spokesman Bob Rocks quoted Branch Davidian survivor
Renos Avraam as saying: &quot;The fire's been lit. The fire's been lit.&quot;
But when questioned on camera by reporters, Avraam said: &quot;One of the
tanks knocked over a gas lantern, and it started a fire under some bales
of hay that were laying around. The fire wasn't started by us.&quot;</P>

<P>PRESIDENT CLINTON'S PRESS CONFERENCE AND DAMAGE CONTROL - President
Clinton gave a Rose Garden press conference on 04/20/93 in which he defended
and sought to justify Reno's, The FBI's and BATF's actions in Waco. The
lies and distortions which Clinton told in that press conference were incredible:</P>

<P>1. &quot;The Branch Davidians had illegally stockpiled weapons and ammunition.&quot;
[ED. NOTE: That was only suspected, but never proven. Shouldn't the government
have proven that before they killed almost 100 people? Is it now lawful
to kill people during investigations of wrongdoing? Lawful or not, it is
now commonplace in America!]</P>

<P>2. Koresh &quot;placed innocent children at risk.&quot; [ED NOTE: There
was no risk until the government attacked the compound. Wasn't it Reno,
the BATF, and FBI that put the innocent children at risk?]</P>

<P>3. &quot;The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the
individual with whom they were dealing David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational,
and probably insane.&quot; [ED NOTE: None of the townspeople who knew Koresh
observed this, nor did the former Distric Attorney of McClennon County,
nor the sheriff's deputies who knew him. He did have strange religious
views, but most of the townspeople who knew him liked him.]</P>

<P>4. Clinton said the April 19 FBI attack on the Branch Davidians was
&quot;an effort to protect the young hostages. &quot; [ED NOTE: The government
didn't protect them, they killed them. And, the children were not hostages.
They were hthere of their own free will. The Waco seige was never a hostage
crisis.]</P>

<P>5. Clinton said: &quot;The [FBI] plan included a decision to withhold
the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead use tear gas
that would not cause permanent damage.&quot; [ED. NOTE: No one knows who
fired at who during the final seige, because the press were kept two miles
away, unless one wants to accept Clinton's word, and the government did
not use tear gas - it was highly lethal, flammable CS gas (as discussed
above).]</P>

<P>6. Clinton said: &quot;Mr. Koresh's response to the demand for his surrenter
by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were
his captives...He killed those he controlled.&quot; [ED NOTE: There is
no evidence that Koresh murdered any children; it is open to question whether
at the last moment he shot himself; and the chidlren (according to local
townspeople, Branch Davidian survivors, and Texas social workers, were
NOT captives.]</P>

<P>7. Clinton said: &quot;I hope very much that others who will be tempted
to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will
be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks.&quot;
[ED NOTE: Is this a not so veiled threat that if you belong to an unpopular,
misfit, non-mainstream religious group, the same thing could happen to
you? The intimidation value from the Waco inferno for the government against
small religious grounps, conservative, patriotic, pro-life, or non-mainstream
groups is incredible. Conform or we'll destroy you!]</P>

<P>8. When asked by a reporter, &quot;Why now,&quot; Clinton replied: &quot;There
was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their
limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.
They might be needed in other parts of the country.&quot; [ED NOTE: Limited
resources? This is the government which is giving billions of dollars to
Russia in aid and requesting billions more for 1001 boondoggles. And as
far as spreading the &quot;experts&quot; too thin, there were only a few
hundred troops and agents there. The government has tens of thousands of
federal agents and allegedly over a million military personnel.]</P>

<P>9. Clinton said: &quot;The danger of them [the Branch Davidians] doing
something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease,
with the passage of time.&quot; [ED NOTE: Quite to the contrary, as time
went by, the likelyhood that they wwould come out increased, according
to experts who have dealt with many of these types of crises.]</P>

<P>10. Clinton said: &quot;They [the FBI] had reason to believe that the
children inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as
being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions.&quot; [ED NOTE:
There was no evidence of child abuse according to several Texas social
workers who had visited the compound. However, the gassing (with CS gas)
and burning of the children by the Clintonistas does seem to this writer
to qualify as child abuse. And if the conditions were unsanitary and unsafe
in the compound it was because the government had turned off the water,
head and electricity 50 days earlier. Government gunfire into the building
might also qualify as &quot;an unsafe condition.&quot;]</P>

<P>FLYING SAUCERS: THE REAL STORY</P>

<P>Popular Science Feb '95</P>

<P>From the hopeless tangle of claims and counterclaims emerges the documented
fact that secret military research HAS explored flying saucer flight.</P>

<P>Exposed and utterly alone beneath the incandescent starts of the Nevada
desert, I dropped my pack and squirmed the last few yards to the summet
of White Sides Mountain. Carrying only a pair of binoculars, a tape recorder
and a radio scanner, I groped over the rocks, knowing that carelessness
now would waste all my care in getting here: the long, 4-wheel-drive detour
to avoid road sensors that alert base security, the zigzag hike through
the sage brush, the pains taken to stay off ridgelines where I might be
profiled against the sky.</P>

<P>Pulling myself up to peer over the last jagged parapet, I was sure for
the first time in hours that I was in the right place. Across 12 miles
of darkened scrub, just beneath the far horizon glimmered Dreamland, a
splash of gemlike lights tossed into a hollow in the hills. Also known
as Area 51, it's a terrestrial black hole into which it's estimated millions
of tax dollars disappear each day while hardly a word of explanation escapes.</P>

<P>A complex of hangars, giant parabolic antennas and one of the longest
runways on Earth, Area 51 spreads the length of Nevada's remote Groom Lake
dry lake bed. For four decades-through the top-secret U-2 spyplane program
of the '50s, the SR-71 spyplane of the '60s, the F-117A stealth fighter
of the '80s-Groom Lake has been where our government has come when it wants
to be alone.</P>

<P>Now, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the lights of Groom
Lake still burn throughout the night with wartime urgency. And whatever
secrets lie there are guarded with undiminished vigilance. Armed, unidentified
men stalk the sagebrush in camouflage fatigues. Unmarked Black Hawk helicopters
sweep the hills. Electronic sensors hidden along the approaching roads
report the presence of vehicular traffic. Keep in mind that you're subject
to all of this on public land, before you make it to the border marked
with signs reading &quot;use of deadly force authorized.&quot;</P>

<P>UFO capital</P>

<P>It was not until this past summer; amid mounting publicity, that the
Air Force gave up denying the undeniable. &quot;We do have facilities within
the complex near the dry lake bed of Groom Lake,&quot; says its latest
official statement. The Air Force adds that the Nellis Range Complex-of
which Groom Lake is a part-is &quot;used for testing and training technologies,
operations and systems critical to the effectiveness of U.S. military forces.
Specific activities conducted at Nellis cannot be discussed any further
than that.&quot;</P>

<P>But that, of course, is only the beginning of the discussion. With so
much unexplained, speculation naturally ranges from the merely exotic to
the otherworldly. Glenn Campbell, a former computer programmer who has
studied and written about the base fulltime since moving to the tiny nearby
town of Rachel a year and a half ago, fondly refers to his adopted neighborhood
as &quot;the UFO capital,&quot; and &quot;America's most popular secret
airbase.&quot;</P>

<P>Articles and TV specials have theorized endlessly about Groom Lake.
Aerospace technology enthusiasts point to the likelihood that Lockheed
would be testing a hypersonic spyplane there, just as it earlier tested
the SR-71. But what has really established Groom Lake as a place of pilgrimage
for UFO watchers is the lure of the flying saucer.</P>

<P>It was this same fascination-one that has gripped America since the
term first came into common parlance 47 years ago-that brought me to Groom
Lake this past fall. It stands to reason that if our military has flying
saucers, this is where they'd be.</P>

<P>But as it turned out, Groom Lake was only the beginning of the story.
Sure, it is possible that there are flying saucers somewhere in the Nellis
Range Complex. Given the level of secrecy almost anything is possible,
and there are in face a number of intriguing claims to this effect. But
more fascinating is the verifiable fact that these would not be the first
flying saucers our government has hidden from us.</P>

<P>First Sighting</P>

<P>Think back to 1947, to a world sick of war and an America racing to
build its nuclear deterrent against the looming Soviet threat. In June
of that year, while flying his private plane near Washington's Mount Rainier,
Kenneth Arnold said he spotted &quot;a chain of nine peculiar-looking aircraft&quot;
that &quot;flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.&quot;
By timing their passage between tow peaks, he later estimated their ground
speed to be about 1700 mph.</P>

<P>Arnold, a deputy federal marshal and successful businessman, was a difficult
witness to dismiss. His sighting was widely reported and thoroughly investigated,
eventually by the Army Air Force (AAF), which feared he might have seen
some new Soviet secret weapon.</P>

<P>But first another possibility had to be ruled out: Was it one of ours?
Accordingly to Curtis Peebles' Watch The Skies!, a history of the flying
saucer phenomenon recently published by the Smithsonian, an early suspect
was a formerly secret Navy fighter program. &quot;Are you positive the
Navy junked the XF5U-1 project?&quot; asked one 1947 AAF memo.</P>

<P>America's first saucer</P>

<P>Built by Chance Vought of Stratford, Connecticut, the XF5U-1 &quot;Flying
Flapjack&quot; was the closest thing anybody knew of to a flying saucer.
Although capable of nothing like the 1700 mph reported by Arnold, its bizarre
circular plan-form nonetheless promised performance unlike anything that
had come before.</P>

<P>The program traces back to the 1930s, when National Advisory Committee
on Aeronautics engineer Charles Zimmerman flew a series of unmanned models
that led him to the Flapjack shape. The extraordinary virtue of the design
was that it defied what had seemed a fundamental aerodynamic tradeoff.
The Flapjack managed both the high top speeds desirable for combat and
the low stalling speeds needed to operate out of small airfields, or off
the decks of ships. In face, with enough engine power, it could hang by
its props, and take off vertically, without any airstrip at all.</P>

<P>The saucer shape's high-speed performance came from the fact that it
was essentially a very low aspect ratio wing - a wing with a low ratio
of length to width-like that on a modern fighter jet. Although stubby wings
can be shaped to produce relatively little drag at high speeds, they suffer
badly at low speeds. The cause is partly that large amounts of air spill
up from under the wingtips and swirl into tornado-like vortices that trail
behind the aircraft. Zimmerman limited this induced drag by placing the
Flashback's propellers at its edges and gearing them so that they counteracted
the vortices.</P>

<P>This simple idea proved out remarkably well in more than 100 flights
by a manned test craft called the V-173. In late 1942, the NAVY okayed
construction of two full-scale prototypes. Powered by a pair of 1600-horsepower
Pratt &amp; Whitney Twin Wasp radials, the XF5U-1 was expected to fly at
up to 425 miles per hour and yet alight daintily at as little as 40 mph.
Based on his experience with the V-173, Zimmerman predicted that a turbine-powered
Flapjack would eventually reach 550 mph, while takeoff and landing speeds
would dwindle to zero.</P>

<P>We'll never know if he was right. The XF5U-1 prototypes were ready by
1947, but never flew. The Navy by this time decided to throw its full weight
behind more orthodox jet fighters and ordered the XF5U-1 destroyed. No
plane did what the Flapjack promised to do until the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel-a
precursor to today's Harrier vertical-takeoff attack fighter-began flying
in the 1960s.</P>

<P>As 1947 drew to a close, the Arnold sighting and a number of others
remained unresolved. The XF5U-1 wasn't behind them. Nor did they seem to
be anything within the reach of Soviet technology. An exhaustive review
of Nazi wartime research hadn't turned up any explanations either. The
newly instituted U.S. Air Force took very seriously the possibility that
something we didn't understand was roaming our airspace. It secretly launched
Project Sign, the first of a series of UFO investigations that were to
stretch on for more than 20 years.</P>

<P>Shape of the future</P>

<P>As the Air Force pondered reports of unbelievable high-performance flying
discs, engineers grew more and more intrigued by the aerodynamic and structural
properties of such a shape. A lengthy and detailed patent applied for by
the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. in 1953 describes an &quot;aircraft of circular
plan-form a nd of bi-convex vertical cross section&quot; - basically, a
giant lentil. As with the Flying Flapjack, the benefits foreseen included
a combination of high forward speeds (better than Mach 4 in this case)
and vertical takeoff and landing capability.</P>

<P>The patent enumerates several properties that suit a saucer to those
goals. The shape, it claims, provides excellent structural rigidity, aerodynamic
stability in vertical ascent and descent, and room inside for large amounts
of payload and fuel. Furthermore, its smooth profile and unbroken leading
and trailing edges were though to lend it inherent aerodynamic efficiency.</P>

<P>There's no record of Lockheed's radical craft ever getting off the drawing
board, but it seems somehow fitting that there should be an early link
between Lockheed and a saucer. As creator of the U2, SR-71 and F-117A,
Lockheed's name intertwines with Groom Lake's from the beginning. And saucers,
of course, are what people come here to see.</P>

<P>Weapon System 606A</P>

<P>Around the time Lockheed applied for its patent, Britain's Avro Aircraft,
builder of some of World War II's most successful bombers, began work on
a more practical saucer at its plant near Toronto, Canada. Under a Canadian
government contract, Avro sketched out a vehicle that harnesses a newly
discovered benefit of the circular wing. Jetted down from the wing's perimeter,
a circular curtain of thrust created a &quot;bubble&quot; of high pressure
air that resulted in very efficient vertical lift, much like a hovercraft
but without the flexible skirt.</P>

<P>Avro designed this effect into a GETOL (Ground Effect Takeoff and Landing)
craft that used it to get airborne, then gradually directed thrust aft
until lift on the circular wing took over. Canada soon decided it couldn't
afford to pursue the idea, but the U.S. Air Force saw it as a way out of
a troubling Cold War vulnerability.</P>

<P>Fearing that Soviet strikes on European airfields could all too easily
take out planes out of a fight, the Air Force picked up funding for Avro's
GETOL work in 1954. Under a highly classified program designated Weapon
System 606A, it developed a concept plane with a top speed of 1000 mph.</P>

<P>Considering it would be years before a fighter without GETOL capabilities
went that fast, this was a radical proposition. To lower the stakes, the
Air Force joined the Army in funding construction of a slower, simpler
test craft. The result was one of the strangest machines in the annals
of military aviation.</P>

<P>The VZ-9V Avrocar bristled with untried ideas. Buried at the center
of its 18-ft-dia. circular wing was a 5-ft. fan, surrounded by three turbojets
lying on their sides in a triangle. Jet exhaust spun the fan by blowing
over turbine blades that ringed its edge, and the resulting thrust was
ducted out to nozzles at the wing's periphery.</P>

<P>Lacking conventional tail surfaces, the Avrocar was expected from the
outset to be unstable. The designers devised an ingenious but complex mechanism
to automatically feed corrections back into the control system, using the
central fan as a gyroscopic reference. In essence, it strove to mimic the
performance of a modern computerized fly-by-wire system by purely mechanical
means.</P>

<P>But instability still proved to be the Avrocar's undoing. In test flights,
it hovered reasonably well close to the ground, but at 5 or 6ft. it developed
a violent &quot;hubcapping&quot; wobble and had to be tethered for its
own protection. Wind tunnel tests showed the control system couldn't hold
it steady in forward flight either, and speeds greater than 35 mph were
never attempted. In December of 1961, with $10 million spent, the project
was abandoned.</P>

<P>&quot;It was a very ingenious idea, but it was just way too early,&quot;
says Dan Murray, who managed the program for the Air Force. Murray now
believes that helicopters and other specialized craft have taken over the
roles for which the Avrocar was planned. &quot;I'm sure you could build
a flying saucer today,&quot; he says. &quot;The question is, why?&quot;</P>

<P>Saucers today</P>

<P>Yet the saucer lives on. Sikorsky Aircraft has been testing a 6-ft.-dia.
discshaped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called the Cypher since 1988.
In many respects, it is the robotic heir to the Avrocar, with maneuverability
that lets it lurk around terrain features as its carriers out reconnaissance.
Then there's a series of saucers build by Moller International, whose founder,
Paul Moller, drew lessons from the Avrocar. His latest, the one man, 8
engine M200X, flew stably and demonstrated technologies for a proposed
flying car. In the lighter-that-air arena, the Russians looked to a shape
strikingly reminiscent of Lockheed's 1953 patent to make their huge Thermoplane
cargo blimps stable at low speeds and efficient at high speeds.</P>

<P>But what about high-performance saucers, saucers like those the Air
Force feared 47 years ago? Was Weapon System 606A and the failed Avrocar
really the end of large-scale military saucer research?</P>

<P>Tantalizing leads suggest not. William Blake, an engineer at the Air
Force's Wright Laboratory, told us of a huge nuclear powered craft designed
by Convair in the early '60s under a Navy contract for a transoceanic transport.
He found a brief article dated June 1960, which shows a general arrangement
drawing, and describes the vehicle as 400ft. in diameter and capable of
carrying a million-pound payload. Known as the ground-effect machine, or
GEM, the concept relied on a curtain jet like ht Avrocar for lift near
the ground, but had no provision for flight at higher altitudes.</P>

<P>More recent but also more dubious is the well-publicized story of Robert
Lazar, who says he worked at a Nellis Range base even more secret than
Area 51. He says the base, called S4, consists of nine underground hangars
containing extraterrestrial saucers that the government is trying to reproduce.
But when we ran his explanation of the spacecrafts' workings by a respected
physicist, we were told it contained obvious errors. Nor does Lazar's claimed
educational background check out.</P>

<P>A more mundane scenario might warrant consideration, however. Recent
years have seen the maturation of the electronic flight controls needed
to stabilize a saucer, while stealth has brought a whole new set of parameters
to aircraft design. Although the techniques for foiling radar are complex
and largely classified, a key principle is to minimize the surfaces that
might intersect a radar beam at a right angle. What, one has to wonder
would do this better than a flying disc?</P>

<P>This question ran through my mind as I trained my telescope on Area
51. The night before, Glenn Campbell and I had been spotted by security
as we watched from another hill, and we immediately heard &quot;We just
went into condition watchdog...we have visitors on the hill&quot; over
the control-tower-frequency. Something was told not to land. Something
they didn't want us to see even from 12 miles away.</P>

<P>So tonight atop White Sides, I'm determined to lay low. The tower opens
at 4 am and with the words &quot;no condition in effect&quot; confirms
I'm undetected. At 4:30 am, a Black Hawk flying with no lights makes a
low pass, but I'm hidden in a rocky ravine. Dawn breaks. Activity at the
base picks up. In the crisp morning air, cars, trucks, even people are
visible moving among the hangars.</P>

<P>An F117-A takes to the runway, but no saucers. Still, there's a strange
exhilaration at my solitary view into this secret world. There's something
out there. And as long as they won't tell us what it is, our dreams of
flying saucers will have this place to roost.</P>

<P><A NAME="- 6"></A>- 6 -</P>

<P>MEDICAL DOCTOR PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE TO PROVE THE HIV VIRUS DOES
NOT CAUSE AIDS.</P>

<P>If you or someone you know has tested positive for the HIV virus there
is now good news.</P>

<P>The chances you will get ill or die from AIDS are no greater that if
the test came out negative.</P>

<P>The London Times reports a major research group has recently proven
the test for the HIV virus (which is claimed to cause AIDS) is completely
invalid and &quot;riddled with false positives&quot;.</P>

<P>Malnutrition, multiple infections, malaria, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis,
having once had the &quot;flu&quot; or measles even the bodies own natural
response to anal semen all result in positive HIV/AIDS tests.</P>

<P>Now the truth is finally revealed. When a completely normal and health
person tests positive for HIV, is then put on the deadly drug AZT - they
die. Death results from the destruction of the immune system caused by
the deadly drug AZT and not by HIV.</P>

<P>I interviewed Dr. Robert E. Willner, a medical doctor who has practiced
and lectured on medicine worldwide for over 35 years. He recently stunned
Spain by inoculating himself with the blood of Pedro Tocino, an HIV positive
hemophiliac. Dr. Willner is the author of the just published blockbuster
book &quot;Deadly Deception: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do Not
Cause AIDS.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Dr. Willner, you say in your book AIDS is the greatest fraud in medical
history. That the perpetrators of this crime are raking in billions while
innocent people are being murdered with the deadly drug AZT. Is AIDS a
scam?</P>

<P>A. No, people are indeed dying of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
or AIDS. The scam is that AIDS is not caused by HIV and AIDS is not transmitted
sexually or by any other means. The real causes of AIDS have been known
for centuries and have been listed in medical textbooks for over 60 years.
We have all been lied to and sold a bill of goods by a handful of unscrupulous,
immoral scientists that care more for money and power than for the truth
and human life itself.</P>

<P>Most of the medically supervised AIDS deaths were either caused or contributed
to by the deadly drug AZT. In many cases it was given to perfectly normal
and health individuals who were terrorized by fear from the AIDS media
blitz into taking the phony HIV test. When a percentage got positive test
results they were then given lethal doses of AZT, a drug that was shelved
over 20 years ago because it was found to be too toxic to give terminally
ill cancer patients.</P>

<P>Q. We have been told all along that all AIDS patients have the HIV virus
and that is what causes AIDS!</P>

<P>A. That is an absolute lie! The HIV/AIDS hypothesis was based on the
fact that only 40% of AIDS cases were confirmed by the Center for Disease
Control to have the antibodies to HIV and not the virus itself. In New
York and San Francisco only 7% of the AIDS victims were HIV positive. This
means that 60 to 93% of all AIDS patients that were used to create the
AIDS hypothesis were HIV negative.</P>

<P>The entire AIDS hypothesis is based upon a total lie. We were all lied
to when we were lead to believe that 100% of AIDS victims were HIV positive.</P>

<P>Q. But how could this happen?</P>

<P>A. To answer that question we must examine just exactly who created
this great lie.</P>

<P>It was none other than Dr. Robert Gallo who was investigated and found
guilty of &quot;scientific misconduct&quot;. The very same Dr. Robert Gallo
who just a few years prior to AIDS discovered what he called the HTLV retrovirus.
He claimed that HTLV caused human leukemia but failed to gain scientific
acceptance because he could not prove it.</P>

<P>Gallo likewise claimed that HTLV was sexually transmitted and had a
latent period of 40 years.</P>

<P>That theory was rejected and failed to gain Dr. Gallo acceptance into
the National Academy of Sciences. His theories on AIDS are just as fallacious
and one cannot help but see the similarities in the scenario.</P>

<P>However, this time instead of trying to prove his insane theories about
AIDS to his peers, without scientific proof, he by-passed them and went
public.</P>

<P>Then, with the help of Margaret Heckler, former head of Health and Human
Services, who was under great political pressure to come up with an answer
to AIDS, the infamous world press announcement of the discovery of the
so-called AIDS virus came about.</P>

<P>This great fraud is now responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands
of individuals world wide. It was no accident that Gallo just happened
to patent the test for HIV the day after the announcement to the world
was made. It likewise is no accident that Gallo is now a multimillionaire
because of AIDS and his fraudulent AIDS test.</P>

<P>Q. Are you saying that Dr. Gallo created AIDS?</P>

<P>A. In a manner of speaking, yes he did. By taking a number of diseases
that were killing a select group of individuals and claiming that they
all had one thing in common - the innocent retrovirus he now called HIV;
which he also claimed was sexually transmitted.</P>

<P>The truth is that these individuals were indeed dying of a variety of
diseases and they all did have one thing in common but it had nothing to
do with their sexual preference or with Gallo's harmless so called &quot;mysterious&quot;
HIV retrovirus.</P>

<P>They were all dying from specific causes that I go into great detail
explaining in my book. The information is completely documented and based
on cold, hard scientific facts-not on the phony, unproven guesswork or
the fraud-laced hypothesis that is the very foundation of Gallo's ridiculous
AIDS theory.</P>

<P>Q. How do you answer proponents of the HIV/AIDS connection when they
argue that &quot;everyone knows HIV causes AIDS&quot;?</P>

<P>A. Once &quot;everyone knew&quot; the earth was flat and the sun revolved
around it. It has been more than twelve years since the so-called &quot;discovery&quot;
of AIDS. Yet, there is still not one single reference paper that exists
in the world that proves HIV causes AIDS. In other words, no experimental
proof whatsoever has been offered to establish that the harmless retrovirus,
which cannot even be found in 50% of the individuals with AIDS, has anything
to do with it.</P>

<P>Q. Isn't it true that any disease capable of destroying a human body
is always found in vast numbers in the infected person?</P>

<P>A. Yes, of course. Yet, even the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) invented by Dr. Kary Mulli, Nobel Prize Laureate, which literally
makes it impossible for viruses to hide, can't find Gallo's HIV virus in
sufficient quantities to give someone the flu let alone kill them.</P>

<P>HIV is rarely found in T-cells (1 virus per 10,000 to 1,000,000 cells)
and when it is found it is doing absolutely nothing. In cases of full blown
AIDS, even in those just hours from death, the virus is extremely difficult
to find; and in 50% of the cases it cannot be found at all. Whenever it
is found, even in active cases of AIDS, HIV is inactive, not reproducing
and it is certainly not killing T-cells as Gallo claims.</P>

<P>Q. Then what exactly is HIV?</P>

<P>A. HIV is simply a harmless piece of dead tissue, not unlike numerous
other retroviruses that exist in our body at any given time. It is one
thousandth the size of a regular cell is harmless and is simply incapable
of doing anything that Gallo claims of it.</P>

<P>Q. Does Dr. Mullis share your contention about HIV and AIDS?</P>

<P>A. Yes he does. Dr. Mullis says: &quot;Scientists don't believe, they
have evidence...There is no such body of knowledge&quot; (with reference
to HIV as the cause of AIDS).</P>

<P>Dr. Peter Duesberg, Professor of Molecular Biology University of CA.,
Berkely and member of the National Academy of Sciences, puts it even more
distinctly. He writes &quot;HIV does not cause AIDS...The point that everyone
is missing is that all of those original papers, Gallo wrote on HIV have
been found fraudulent..&gt;The HIV hypothesis was based on those papers.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Are there other who also support your position?</P>

<P>A. Nearly 500 of the world's top scientists are now challenging Gallo's
hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS and the list is growing daily. Every statistic,
every valid scientific observation and even the test of time now proves
Gallo wrong. It was only a matter of time until thinking scientists raised
their heads out of the sand, saw the truth and started questioning the
lies that simply did not stand up to the scrutiny of impartial scientific
reasoning and experimentation.</P>

<P>Project AIDS International charges that &quot;the dogmatic AIDS hypothesis
based on the findings of a person convicted of science fraud, is directly
or indirectly responsible for the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands
of people worldwide.&quot; PAI further goes on to say: &quot;If action
is not taken immediately against those who are directly or indirectly responsible
for these crimes against humanity through the practice of profit over life,
the drug induced AIDS deaths will most certainly reach proportions unparalleled
by any natural catastrophe in human history.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. What about Dr. Gallo's contention that HIV is a slow &quot;mysterious&quot;
and &quot;intelligent&quot; virus.</P>

<P>A. Dr. Duesberg renowned as one, if not the world's foremost retroviologist,
answers that question by saying that: &quot;Slow&quot; or &quot;lente&quot;
viruses do not exist! It is another hypothetical invention designed to
explain what is obviously nonsense. It has no basis in fact, no precedent
in science, and is contradictory to 20 years of research findings (and
I might add billions of dollars in funding). Retroviruses can only be replicated
by the host cell, and are dependent on the life-cycle of that cell. Therefore,
the virus must duplicate within hours or days in order to survive. For
over 20 years, an exhaustive investigation of retroviruses reveals that
there is no such thing as a &quot;slow virus&quot;. There is nothing biochemically
or genetically different about HIV that would give it the power to act
any differently than any other retrovirus. As Dr. Duesberg so aptly puts
it, &quot;there are no slow viruses, only slow virologists.&quot;</P>

<P>Q. Did you always know HIV was not the true cause of AIDS?</P>

<P>A. NO. I have to admit that in the beginning I too believed Gallo's
big lie. But the more I learned about retroviruses the more the AIDS hypothesis
didn't make sense.</P>

<P>Q. Surely there were a few independent scientists who tried to expose
this fraud?</P>

<P>A. There were and as an example of how their dissension was squelched
I'll quote Dr. Joesph Sonnabend, Founder, of the AIDS Medical Foundation.
His is typical of how opposition to the AIDS hypothesis was dealt with.
Dr. Sonnabend writes: &quot;...I tried to show that HTLV-1 (HIV) was not
involved in AIDS, all the journals refused to publish it.&quot; After twenty
one years of intensive research, not one clinically-relevant retrovirus
has ever been discovered, and by scientific standards HIV is no exception.
You also have to understand that when Maragaret Heckler, head of Health
and Humane Services, adopted HIV as the cause of AIDS, basically all institutions
which rely on federal government funding or grands had to go along and
cooperate or face extinction. HHS is the paymaster for all health departments
and agencies. This includes the National Institutes of Health.</P>

<P>Q. What about Kimberly Bergails, and Magic Johnson?</P>

<P>A. Kimberly Bergalis would still be alive today is she were not given
AZT. Magic Johnson is probably as healthy today as he ever was and will
continue to live a long and happy life so long as he does not take AZT
or any other deadly drug.</P>

<P>Q. Why did you inoculate yourself with the blood of an HIV positive
hemophiliac?</P>

<P>A. Because I can no longer stand by and watch the profession I love,
be deceitfully used to commit murder by following the Gallo HIV/AIDS' death
banner. I have vowed that if its is necessary I will repeat the process
of sticking myself with the blood of an HIV positive person on television
in every city in the world until this genocide stops.</P>

<P>Q. Dr. Willner in &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; you say AZT is one of
the chief causes of AIDS, can you elaborate further for our readers?</P>

<P>A. Yes, and again I will begin by quoting Dr. Peter Duesberg: &quot;AZT
is A Random Killer Of Infected And Non Infected Cells. AZT cannot discriminate
among them. It kills T-cells; B-cells; red cells, it kills all cells. AZT
is a chain terminator of DNA synthesis of all cells-no exceptions. It wipes
out everything. In the long run it can only lead to death of the organism-and
the cemetery. AZT is a certain killer! Who will be responsible for the
death of patients (some 200,000 now being treated with AZT and countless
thousands who have already died from it in the past decade) that results
from AZT therapy - pharmacological homicide?&quot;</P>

<P>The makers of AZT claim that &quot;it increases the quality of life.&quot;
Yet, all one needs do is read the package insert that comes along with
AZT and you will learn the truth.</P>

<P>The side effects of AZT as listed on its own package inserts are: Cancer
(lymphomas), Hepatitis, Dementia, Mania (madness, frenzy), Seizures (epileptic),
Anxiety, Anemia, Leukopenia, (standard laboratory evidence of immune suppression),
Impotence, Severe Nausea, Chest Pain, Insomnia, Ataxia (loss of balance),
Depression, Muscle Atrophy (wasting) and this is only half of the death
sentence list of side effects that AZT causes. Does this sound like AZT
adds to the quality of life to you or does it sound like what it really
is-AIDS!</P>

<P>Q. Are there other causes of AIDS?</P>

<P>A. Yes, there are and I explain each and every known cause of AIDS in
great detail in my book, and may I add, not one of them is sexually transmitted
or HIV related.</P>

<P>Q. What can a person suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency do?</P>

<P>A. There are actually many things a person with AIDS can do if there
is enough time and in most cases there is. The first and most important
thing is to get off any type of immune suppressive drug whether it be recreational,
prescription or over the counter immediately. Secondly, don't be conned
into taking AZT or any other last minuet, last chance at life. Thirdly,
stop believing the lie that you are going to die. Finally get and read
a copy of my book &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; as soon as possible. It
contains the information you need to strengthen your immune system. Follow
what it tells you and you will probably be OK.</P>

<P>This concluded my interview with Dr. WIllner. I must admit that before
I read &quot;Deadly Deception&quot;: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely
Do Not Cause AIDS, I too was skeptical. I believed what everyone else believed
that HIV caused AIDS, that HIV is sexually transmitted, that if you have
HIV you will eventually die of AIDS.</P>

<P>In &quot;Deadly Deception&quot; Dr. Willner proves the AIDS hypothesis
is totally fraudulent. Its perpetrators are guilty of criminal fraud and
murder.</P>

<P>The HIV virus does not and could not possible cause AIDS or any serious
disease for that matter.</P>

<P>AIDS is not transmitted sexually nor is it contagious by any method!</P>

<P>Backed by scientific and factual proof you will learn the truth:</P>

<P>What the real causes of AIDS are and how to totally avoid them.</P>

<P>How the HIV test can be positive because of having a simple &quot;Flu&quot;
vaccination, the measles or many other common infections!</P>

<P>Why AIDS is not an epidemic but a total myth based on false projections
disproved by time and the statistics.</P>

<P>In the United States, more people die each year overdosing on sleeping
pills than die from AIDS!</P>

<P>Why the homosexual community erroneously became identified as AIDS carriers.</P>

<P>Why AIDS is a syndrome transmittable disease.</P>

<P>Why 25 to 30 diseases were, for the first time in recorded history,
lumped together under a new name (AIDS) to give the appearance of an epidemic!</P>

<P>Acquired Immune Deficiency is not new; its cause have been known and
written about in medical books for almost seventy years.</P>

<P>On October 3, 1993, the London Times headline read, &quot;African Aids
'a myth'&quot;. Inside, across two pages, the headline screamed, &quot;The
Plague That Never Was&quot;, yet this story which exposes the AIDS myth
in Africa has not even been mentioned in the mainstream U.S. press...Why?</P>

<P>More than 500 of the world's leading scientists have challenged the
AIDS hypothesis - they are being silenced, slandered and ignored...Why?</P>

<P>The Answers are all in &quot;Deadly Deception&quot;, the nearly 300
page hard cover book!</P>

<P>&quot;Deadly Deception&quot; blows the lid off the entire AIDS fraud.
It names those responsible. It takes every argument you have ever heard
about the relationship between HIV, sex and AIDS and tears them to shreds
by exposing the lies to the bright light of truth.</P>

<P>Dr. Willner writes in clear, easy to understand language that is both
entertaining and enlightening. You won't be able to put this book down.
After you read it you will never fear AIDS again, your eyes however, will
forever be opened to how easy it is for us all to be duped by half truths,
lies, prejudice, fear and by unscrupulous, power and money hungry people
who think they can literally get away with murder in the name of science.</P>

<P>As a closing note; two AIDS researchers in Europe have already been
found guilty of fraud.</P>

<P>An independent study has proven AZT to be 1000 times more toxic to human
cells than was originally claimed.</P>

<P>There is currently a class action suite in England against the makers
of AZT by the families of its victims.</P>

<P>I URGE each and everyone of you to get a copy of Dr. Willner's new book:

Cause AIDS.</P>

<P>TOTAL Surveillance : Your Life On A Chip</P>

<P>From Mondo 2000 #13</P>

<P>By Charles Ostman</P>

<P>Imagine a world in which every aspect of your life, past and present,
is encrypted on a personal ID card and stored on a nationwide data base.
Where virtually all communications media-soon to be 100% digital-are automatically
monitored by computerized phone taps and satellites from control centers
thousands of miles away. Where self-training neural net and artificial
intelligence data search systems scan for undesirable lifestyles and target
you for automatic monitoring.</P>

<P>Personal privacy was once considered the most sacred of our constitutional
rights; agencies were severely limited by law. All that's about to change
drastically thanks to a deadly combination of extremely sophisticated surveillance
technology, ubiquitous digital information collection, and centralized
interagency data exchange.</P>

<P>Until recently the &quot;supersecret&quot; National Reconnaissance Organization
did not exist-even though it has the largest budget of any intelligence
agency. They are responsible for the design, development and procurement
of all US reconnaissance satellites and their continued management once
in orbit. Recently photos have surfaced in the press of its huge new complex
being completed in Chantilly, Virginia. (Senator John Warner-Liz Taylor's
ex-has described the one million square foot complex as a &quot;Taj Mahal.&quot;)
The NRO is eagerly implementing such technologies as ultra-high storage
capacity holographic films (allowing huge amounts of personal information
to be present on your ID card) and self-training artificial intelligence
software that tracks your personal data without human intervention. A new
era of ubiquitous surveillance is dawning.</P>

<P>A struggling military-industrial complex searching for new markets for
their technologies has merged forces with a government obsessed with ever
tighter control over the activities of the general public. Congresswoman
Barbara Jordan has proposed a &quot;National Employment Verification Card&quot;
that will be required for all employment in the U.S. The card will, of
course, have a magnetic data strip, and altering or counterfeiting the
card will be a federal felony offense.</P>

<P>There is a dedicated and aggressive effort underway to chart various
genetic features as part of one's personal information set. The fed's goal
is to have the ability to screen individuals for everything from behavioral
characteristics to sexual orientation, based on genetic information embedded
in your personal (and required) National ID card.</P>

<P>Biometric signature technologies have been developing apace. There is
even a technique available to translate human DNA into bar codes for efficient
digital transmission between agencies.</P>

<P>Are these science fiction story lines or the ravings of a paranoid lunatic?
I wish they were. As a former research engineer at Lawrence Livermore Labs
and other government labs, I watched some of these mad schemes being hatched.
This technology is on the street today or about to leave the labs and believe
me, it goes way beyond Orwell's worst nightmares. Listen up and hunker
down.</P>

<P>A fundamental shift in the legal definition of personal privacy is occurring
right now. A court-issued warant used to be a universal requirement for
personal surveillance, such as phone tapping, observing physical papers,
and probing financial or medical records. Now, in this new age of AI-driven
monitoring and data tracking systems, there are no pesky people in the
loop.</P>

<P>A computer doesn't need to seek a court warrant to monitor every aspect
of your private life. A self-training automated surveillance system doesn't
need permission to observe your movements or communications.</P>

<P>Total data tracking is already commonplace for financial institutions
and private security operations. Tomorrow, it will be commonplace for all
of us. The technical elements of a massive surveillance engine are in place.
It's just a matter of turning the key to fire it up. Let's examine these
elements and why you should be concerned.</P>

<P>Universal Encryption Chip</P>

<P>It sounds logical. The feds want to preserve privacy, so their story
goes, so they've announced that an encryption chip will go into all phones
and computers that they buy. But what do they really want in the long run?</P>

<P>How about a government-issue encryption chip in all personal computers
and communication devices? That way, the feds can deal with drug smugglers,
terrorists, kiddie porn merchants, and other miscreants who use encoded
messages.</P>

<P>Of course, they'd have to prevent tampering with the chip. In fact,
the technology to do just that has already been developed at Sandia National
Laboratory. Scientists there have developed an optical sensor that uses
a powdered silicon optical absorption layer in an optical waveguide embedded
in a chip. A micro photodetector detects even the slightest intrusion into
the chip package by measuring a slight change in the photonic conduction
through the waveguide. It can then send an alert via modem to a central
monitoring system to notify an interested party that the device has been
tampered with. Sandia is also developing a microchemical intrusion detector
that would be sensitive to the chemical signature of human fingertips.</P>

<P>Is this all part of some master plan, or what?</P>

<P>In fact, in the near future, all encryption hardware and software will
be subject to federal registration/authorization. Possession of unauthorized
encryption/decryption capability will be punishable as a federal felony.
In other words, if it doesn't have a handy back door for NSA snoops, it
ain't legal.</P>

<P>We can further speculate that the feds will embed chips in all equipment
sold for use in data transmission, digital phone calls and all other frequencies.
Note: all new phone systems wired and wireless will be digital in the next
three years.</P>

<P>Intelligent Video</P>

<P>Nor would you know what's watching you. Security cameras are becoming
standard in corporate and government facilities. They may soon even be
required. Why? Ostensibly because they want to recover loses in case of
theft, keep insurance premiums down, monitor petulant employees and keep
intruders out.</P>

<P>But the new genre of video cameras now coming out of the labs do a lot
more than that. They're intelligent. They can recognize faces, motion,
and other interesting characteristics. In fact, they behave a lot like
a human eye, with intelligent preprocessor abilities.</P>

<P>Intelligent cameras are needed because a security guard or cop can't
monitor the dozens or hundreds of video cameras in a large facility (or
dozens of satellite video surveillance channels). Intelligent cameras use
artificial intelligence-based object and motion recognition. They scan
for what a trained security guard looks for: certain motions, clothing,
faces; the presence of people in off-limits places. Instead of watching
100 cameras, only a few at any time send pictures. A single guard or a
computer can deal with that.</P>

<P>In face, a steady data stream from multiple intelligent cameras can
be uploaded to computerized monitoring facilities anywhere, coupled with
other automated observation systems.</P>

<P>The next big thing in intelligent cameras will be &quot;contentaddressable&quot;
imagery. That means they'll automatically detect the content of sophisticated
patterns, like a specific person's face by matching it against a digital
&quot;wanted&quot; poster, say. New software that can even run on chap
personal computers makes that possible. MatchMaker from Iterated Systems
(Norcross, GA), for example, uses a fractal algorithm that converts image
data into mathematical form, automatically recognizing and categorizing
realtime &quot;targets&quot; untouched by human hands and tied into a centralized
monitoring facility!</P>

<P>A related technology called focal plane array sensors (FPA) discriminates
objects at just about any distance. FPA makes it possible to use neuromorphic
sensors, modeled biologically on the human eye, which are built into a
camera to recognize a person or object by &quot;associative cognition.&quot;</P>

<P>CArver Mead at Cal Tech has designed a broad-spectrum &quot;human-eye&quot;
sensor using FPAs and 3D artificial neural network processors. To prove
the viability of such concepts, Raytheon, under contract with the Guided
Interceptor Branch of the Air Force at Elgin AFB, has developed &quot;smart
eyes&quot; using FPAs for recognizing objects in flight, thus relieving
the pilot of visual target recognition tasks while in a high-pressure combat
situation.</P>

<P>This technology is inexpensive, easily reproducible, and will be part
of standard equipment for fully automated, on-site visual and infrared
surveillance in the near future.</P>

<P>Langley Research Center (Hampton, VA) in conjunction with Telerobotics
International (Knoxville, TN) is taking a step further. They're developing
an advanced surveillance camera system that's even more intelligent: it
uses self aiming and analyzes motion or other parameters. A fisheye spherical
lens views a very wide field of vision while a self-contained image processing
subsystem tracks several moving targets at once in real time. Video for
suspect targets can be transmitted in real time to a security center.</P>

<P>These smart cameras are also getting incredibly tiny and low cost. The
Imputer from VLSI Vision Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland) is a credit card-sized
device that fits in the palm of your hand. It consists of a complete CCD
video camera mounted on a circuit board plus an on-board DSP (digital signal
processing) coprocessor for realtime image enhancement, feature detection,
correlation and convolution (for fast analysis on the fly), and even an
optional library of pre-stored feature data so that the camera can independently
recognize a specific face or other security-oriented data. It can also
download its captured visual data via telephone line to a data collection
and processing facility.</P>

<P>With everything on a few chips, intelligent cameras can now be mass-manufactured
like pocket radios. No need for security personnel-they can be linked to
a computer surveillance monitoring and data base system.</P>

<P>This is where it gets really insidious. When the technology becomes
so cheap, tiny, and powerful, and no guards are needed, they can sprinkle
these things around like corn chips...secretly putting them on every street
corner, in every waiting room, office, wherever.</P>

<P>Keep smiling, because you'll never know when you're on candid camera.
And hey, relax, they've just captured your surfaces.</P>

<P>BIOMETRICS</P>

<P>Where it really starts to get hairy is when we enter the brave new world
of Biometrics. Biometrics is the process of gathering biological information
and converting it into data that can be uploaded into automated systems
for identifying you.</P>

<P>They can use your fingerprint (via automated fingerprint identification
systems), retinal scan, voice or other personal signatures. Miros of Wellesley,
MA has recently introduced a system called Face-to-Face, using neural nets,
that is particularly insidious. Unlike fingerprint or palm recognition,
it identifies your face &quot;non-intrusively&quot; (that's technospeak
for surreptitiously) with 99% recognition. It can even identify your face
when you add glasses or change your hairstyle.</P>

<P>There are biometric service bureaus like TRW that provide immediate
access to personal dossier information to prisons, banks, military bases,
research facilities, pharmaceutical companies, etc. The client simply installs
a retinal scanner or other device and transmits your image to a service
bureau, which sends back your complete dossier. This is big business for
these service bureaus. We're talking billions in government and corporate
contracts.</P>

<P>What's next? We can expect intelligent scanning systems will be installed
in supermarket checkout lines, lobbies, airports, stores, ATM sites, and
so on in the near future. Known shoplifters will be tracked from the time
they walk into the store. There'll be a cordon sanitaire around playgrounds
and day care centers.</P>

<P>What happens when the FBI ties its fingerprint verification system at
its National Criminal Information Center, with its library of over 250,000
fingerprints, into the national health care card system, employment ID
card, IRS, and just about everything else?</P>

<P>If the FBI has you listed as a radical or some other species of undesirable,
will they be automatically notified whenever you appear at a doctor's office?
Every time you use an ATM? What about when you buy a naughty magazine or
subscribe to a &quot;politically incorrect&quot; publication? Where does
this stuff stop?</P>

<P>Satellite Surveillance</P>

<P>It doesn't. You image may be up for sale right now. Ten-meter resolution
satellite images of those strange weeds in your back yard are available
to any buyer from the French company SPOT Image of Reston, Virginia.</P>

<P>Even sharper images are available. Spy satellite images at two meters
resolution are now available from World Map. About 30 other countries-particularly
Germany, Israel, and China-are planning to launch satellite surveillance
systems.</P>

<P>Producers of satellite and surveillance equipment and large database
processing services like TRW have huge financial stakes in this $8 billion
market. They've put massive pressure on the CIA and DoD to loosen up control
of satellite surveillance technology. Three of them-Lockheed, Orbital Sciences(which
is launching Eyeglass), and World View-are launching satellites with resolutions
from one to three meters by 1997.</P>

<P>Another recently-formed U.S. company, Teledesic, is planning a vast
$9 billion global communication system using 840 geosynchronous orbit satellites,
scheduled for 2001. There would be no single area on the planet that could
not be &quot;seen&quot; on demand, and more importantly, virtually all
digital communications could be linked through this universal transponder
system.</P>

<P>Suddenly we're just one step from a universal monitoring system. The
satellites could conceivably serve as platforms for multi-spectra, on-demand,
visual and IR surveillance of any coordinate on the planetary surface.
Note: both founders of Teledesic, Bill Gates and Craig McCaw, declined
to be interviewed by MONDO on this topic.</P>

<P>ROBOT SPIES</P>

<P>Unmanned robotic devices (airborne and land-based) are now here that
can observe an individual or dwelling day or night from a distance. They
can also monitor communications (using RF signatures) over a broad spectrum
of frequencies. They can be activated from a distant control center thousands
of miles away from the target; and surveillance data can be collected and
examined in real time via satellite link.</P>

<P>For example, there's the SR2 Security Robot System from Cybermotion
Inc. of Roanoke, Virginia. Designed to &quot;replace human security personnel,&quot;
the SR2 patrols a region of up 15 square miles for 12 hour shifts (between
charges), using ultrasonic, optical, and infrared sensors plus onboard
&quot;fuzzy logic&quot; to navigate around complex obstacles and interpret
data. An operator at a remote site controls and interacts with a group
of these robots via bidirectional RF data links.</P>

<P>There's also NASA's High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft.
HALE can stay airborne for days at a time, carrying CCD optical and infrared
camera systems. These lightweight stealth aircraft are flown by remote
control, using satellite data links to an operational command center that
can be thousands of miles away. Perfect for kamikaze-style strikes.</P>

<P>And the U.S. Navy is soliciting proposals to develop a robotic, flyable
platform for optical and infrared surveillance, designed for &quot;riot
control, border surveillance, and personnel detection.&quot;</P>

<P>A fuzzy logic based RF communications signal/signature analysis system
has been solicited by the U.S. Navy. It will be able to recognize the content
of any transmitted signal from anywhere, regardless of spread spectrum,
encryption, or other electronic signal countermeasures. Commercial applications
cited in the solicitation are &quot;law enforcement, surveillance, drug
interdiction, illegal immigrant control, etc.&quot;</P>

<P>Real time monitoring by these robotic devices can be remotely activated
from anywhere. No search warrants, no court authorizations.</P>

<P>MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTERS AND OPTICAL STORAGE</P>

<P>All these surveillance systems generate massive amounts of information.
Until recently this would have been impractical for millions of people.</P>

<P>Currently, massive optical data storage technologies coupled with extremely
powerful, massively parallel processing computers are capable of very high-volume
data storage and very high-speed data analysis.</P>

<P>The Department of Commerce is financing a joint project with Tamarack
Storage Devices to develop a photorefractive holographic data storage system
capable of handling hundreds of terabytes (that's 10^12thpower bytes) of
data for extremely large database processing operations. This is exactly
the type of information storage/processing capability required for a nationwide
population monitoring system. Thinking Machines Inc., of Cambridge, MA
has recently announced a massively parallel processing supercomputer, the
CM-5, specifically designed for extremely huge data base processing applications.
It can access an astonishing 3.2 terabytes of data with a bandwidth of
up to 4.2 gigabytes per second, distributed over a network of 16,000 processing
nodes that can be located anywhere.</P>

<P>A handful of these systems can maintain an up-to-date population monitoring/data
processing system for the entire country.</P>

<P>What do you think is going to be in that secret $350 million National
Reconnaissance Organization (NRO) building in CHantilly, VA? Hint: They're
not watching Russia any more.</P>

<P>NEURAL NETS AND AI</P>

<P>Of course, all these operations normally require huge staffs of trained
experts. That's where neural nets and artificial intelligence come in.
Neural net processing systems can search for &quot;behavioral tendencies&quot;
within a database and automatically flag certain individuals for surveillance
and &quot;attention&quot; from interested enforcement agencies, employers,
political researchers, etc. This is a rung up from knowbots and gobots.</P>

<P>A good example is the ominous Origin system (the U.S. base is Tampa,
FL), a worldwide realtime, intelligent vision processing and networking
database system designed for &quot;intelligent security database monitoring
and observation&quot; for law enforcement and government agencies. It used
Iterated Systems' Matchmaker software running on a global computer network.
A surveillance camera or biometric sensor anywhere can feed signals into
the network and get back a name of the person in seconds.</P>

<P>HNC's (San Diego, CA) DataBase Mining Workstation is a dedicated neural
network processing engine designed to look for &quot;interesting&quot;
data sets on its own. The user &quot;trains&quot; the system for topics
or features of interest. Once effectively trained, the system automatically
tracks anything (or anyone) that gets its attention and draws its own conclusions.</P>

<P>HNC also sells the Falcon neural net credit card &quot;fraud and abuse&quot;
detection system. It automatically &quot;learns&quot; about unusual spending
habits and related behavioral feature sets. Clients for this system include
AT&amp;T, Colonial National Bank, Eurocard Netherlands, First USA Bank,
Household Credit Services, and Wells Fargo Bank. HNC is also working on
credit risk evaluation, bankruptcy potential, and other forms of financial
activity pattern recognition.</P>

<P>Again, no need for pesky humans who can be held accountable for violation
of privacy. &quot;The machine did it!&quot; Once this becomes routine,
current legally-defined barriers to privacy disappear totally.</P>

<P>AUTOMATED VOICE RECOGNITION</P>

<P>In the good old days, they had to attach electronic clips to your phone
and get court authorization. Not so today.</P>

<P>Let's say you're on a list somewhere based on your politics, reading,
or drug, or sexual habits. Zap: you're suddenly on a priority list for
surveillance. You make a call and your voice matches the profile. The system
starts to listen in to your vocal communications in real time. The voice
data can then be digitized, stored, and added to your surveillance dossier
by the computer.</P>

<P>If you've seen the movie Clear and Present Danger, you know how easily
intelligence agencies monitor cellular phone calls, satellite phone calls,
and anything else that's broadcast. (It's actually easy for anyone to monitor
cellular calls with a scanner covering 870 to 896 MHz or a UHF TV receiver
tuned to channels 80 to 83 and a good UHF antenna.) Then they digitize
speech signals and convert them into text data, which can then be processed
to search for specific words or phrases.</P>

<P>All this will be a lot easier when the telephone companies introduce
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communications in a few years. Virtually
all communications, including data transmission and business and personal
phone calls will be routed through the same universal communication channel,
making the job of listening in much easier.</P>

<P>Dialogic Corp. (Parsippany, NJ) is developing &quot;second generation&quot;
modular telephone call-processing and automated speech recognition system
hardware and software. Uses include online automatic keyword and phrase
recognition. That is, any word or word combination that may be &quot;interesting&quot;
to an automated listening system can cue automated storage of an entire
conversation for further analysis.</P>

<P>The Sprint voice-activated phone card is already in use. But several
corporations including TRW have already taken it a step further. They can
analyze and store voice signatures for every telephone caller in the country
for a much larger market: voice recognition for phone credit card verification
and voice-triggered ID security systems. Essentially, you'll be forced
to use voice ID or no credit or access. It's a simple matter to adapt this
kind of technology for a national tracking system.</P>

<P>The U.S. Navy wants to take it a step further. As evidenced by its recent
FY 94 &quot;Global Surveillance and Communications&quot; technology solicitations
(as per the SBIR development funding program), they are developing a &quot;robust
signal processing of speech&quot; capability with &quot;voice communications
countermeasures and counter-countermeasures&quot; as part of a comprehensive,
speech recognition and processing system.</P>

<P>Sun Microsystems workstations include a microphone and speech recognition
chip. A recent security alert from the Computer Emergency Response Team
at Carnegie Mellon University disclosed that the workstations had been
pre-programmed with a &quot;world readable&quot; status feature. That means
any of these networked workstations could in fact serve as a remotely-monitored
microphone. A back door has already been built into this workstation. That
means anyone can activate the microphone to listen in remotely from anywhere
in the world.</P>

<P>DESKTOP NSA</P>

<P>But all this massive power is not limited to giant computer centers.
Even desktop computers are now becoming powerful enough to handle massive
amounts of intelligence information.</P>

<P>Adaptive Solutions Inc. (Beaverton, OR) sells a $7000 CNAPS/PC board
that converts a 486 or Pentium computer into a massively parallel processing
engine. The boards, each of which contains 128 processors, perform 2.56
billion multiply/accumulate operations per second. This means a 1000 times
performance improvement in pattern recognition.</P>

<P>Companies are turning these powerful new surveillance tools on their
own people too. For example, Microsoft has a secret project to monitor
all keystrokes of its personnel to &quot;improve efficiency&quot; using
neural net and artificial intelligence software. And Edify Corp. (Santa
Clara, CA) is supplying &quot;intelligent agent&quot; software to BellSouth
Communications Systems (Roanoke, VA). It will be built into BellSouth's
Electronic Workforce software. Its customers will use it for interactive
voice response and recognition, personnel and client workforce screening,
efficiency monitoring, and workflow automation.</P>

<P>PROBATION NATION</P>

<P>This is NOT another paranoid &quot;1984&quot; scenario based on some
futuristic fantasy. For the first time in history, the technology is available
to design and implement such a ubiquitous surveillance/monitoring system.
This crisis climate created by the media-particularly television &quot;news
magazines&quot;-is being used to mandate this horror.</P>

<P>The political will to do this is here and it is being touted as an acceptable
solution to such problems as crime and illegal immigrants. The general
public is not even remotely familiar with the technical details of how
such a repressive system could be implemented and won't wake up until they're
virtual prisoners in a totally automated Surveillance Society.</P>

<P>SNITCH CHIPS, SLAVE BRACELETS AND YOU</P>

<P>or</P>

<P>LEMME OFF THIS BOARDGAME</P>

<P>by Clark Matthews</P>

<P>Mondo 2000 # 13</P>

<P>Almost from the day President Clinton assumed office, it became obvious.
The secret guardians of national security and public order were fully prepared
to pervert the new generation of information technologies into a monstrously
sophisticated digitotalitarian police state.</P>

<P>The Total Surveillance State taking shape under his leadership appears
to have three broad components:</P>

<P>* Automatic spying on all public and private communications networks.</P>

<P>* Automatic &quot;profiling&quot; of all citizens by computer: gather
all available details-health, consumer habits, political activites, etc.</P>

<P>* Digital identity and social control mechanisms, in particular, Smart
Cards featuring ultra-dense integrated circuitry and trackable Clipper-chip
encryption.</P>

<P>A Smart Card is literally a computer on a credit card, complete with
large amounts of digital storage, and even potential wireless communications
capabilities. Once Smart Cards and digital cash come into wide use, there
is no doubt that this system can be designed to function with ruthless
effectiveness.</P>

<P>The information sciences-and the touted &quot;Information Superhighway&quot;-are
being perveted into a Total Surveillance State. This year, for example,
numerous federal agencies suddenly announced virtually complete plans to
restrict access to their services to Smart Cards only.</P>

<P>CLIPPER: THE &quot;SNITCH CHIP&quot;</P>

<P>Everybody needs papers in a police state. Ironically, the automated
Gestapo no longer needs to issue them. Instead computer-controlled cards
and high-speed computers will monitor special &quot;snitch-chips&quot;
built into household appliances like telephones and cable boxes. Ja Wohl!
The Automatic Gestapo.</P>

<P>Recently some press reports contended that the Clipper chip is &quot;dead.&quot;
I'll let Janet Reno answer that one (7/22/94): &quot;We are working with
industry to develop the same capability [Clipper-style surveillance] for
data networks that Clipper provides for voice networks.&quot; I would hardly
call that &quot;backing away.&quot;</P>

<P>Clipper chips and Clipper-like software snooping schemes are definitely
not dead. On the contrary, they are the very lynchpin of the automated
Gestapo-for both surveillance and personal identification.</P>

<P>President Clinton carefully avoided mentioning Clipper's planned identification
capabilities when he personally announced the chip at a splashy Rose Garden
press conference within weeks of assuming office. He claimed that the chip
was created by &quot;government scientists&quot; to &quot;ensure personal
privacy&quot; for telephone conversations.</P>

<P>Beyond the smarmy assurances, there was another tipoff that something
was peculiar with Clipper: the chip processes information with blazing
speed. It has a bandwidth of 12 megabits per second. That's fast enough
to encrypt a video signal from a small slow-scan camera-perhaps in a videophone,
or perhaps in other household appliances with high-speed communications
links. Your cable box, for instance.</P>

<P>Ever since he announced it, Clinton has deftly moved the Clipper project
around, from the NSA to the Justice Department, to the National Institute
of Science and Technology (NIST) and the Treasury Department. He is dodging
the serious questions-and growing outrage-over the suspicious secret chip.
So what did you expect of someone who didn't inhale?</P>

<P>PROJECT TESSEREA: CLIPPER SLAVE BRACELETS</P>

<P>Tesserea, classic fans, means &quot;a piece of mosaic.&quot; In ancient
Rome, tessereae were also identity tags, which were given to soldiers and
slaves. Slaves caught without them usually came to grief.</P>

<P>Today, tesserea still means the same thing at the NSA and the out-of-the-limelight
Defense Messaging Agency (DMA). For the past few years, these two secret-government
bastions have collaborated to create Tesserea devices. These are computerized
Smart Cards with large amounts of flash memory capacity, somtimes prototype
wireless communications devices-and an on-board &quot;Capstone&quot; chip.</P>

<P>Capstone is Clipper's smart brother, sometimes called &quot;Clipper
2.&quot; It is the brains of Smart Cards. Each Capstone chip has a unique
&quot;digital signature&quot; that identifies it (and its owner) to the
scanning computers of the automatic Gestapo on the communications networks.
In other words, whether you use your Tesserea card to claim disability
benefits or buy golf balls, every transaction will be duly recorded.</P>

<P>There are some interesting angles to these latter-day slave bracelets.
First of all, Tesserea cards were being tested at the DMA years ago-long
before president Clinton's Clipper announcement. Another interesting fact
is the overall code name of the Tesserea project. The project is called
&quot;Mosaic.&quot;</P>

<P>Someone has a classical education, it seems.</P>

<P>Capstone Tesserea cards are being pushed hard by practically every agency
and department of Clinton's government. The pretexts seem almost endless.
They range from tracking &quot;childhood immunizations&quot; by Donna Shalala's
Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to recommend &quot;work
permits&quot; and a &quot;digital passport&quot; created at the Immigration
&amp; Naturalization Service (INS).</P>

<P>Other pretexts include &quot;federal benefits delivery systems&quot;
proposed for the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration,
as well as planned nationwide authorities for distributing military pensions,
food stamps, and other forms of public assistance. Then there's the infamous
&quot;Health Security Card&quot; touted as part of the biggest cat's paw
of all-&quot;Health Care Reform.&quot;</P>

<P>And lastly ther's the Postal Service's &quot;U.S. Card,&quot; proposed
as a no-bones-about-it universal identity card. A postal spokesman actually
hyped the U.S. Card as a device to replace the &quot;twenty million 'Little
Brothers'&quot; waiting in the wings, from every federal agency under Clinton's
control.</P>

<P>Each of these initiative comes complete with an oh-so-vaguely described
national distributed database. The sole exception is the U.S. Card, which
will serve as a universal identifier requried for all integrated government
databases.</P>

<P>TROUBLE ON THE LINE: THE DIGITAL TELEPHONY ACT</P>

<P>Want to start a police state? Control the telephone network. Build telephone
bugs into all new buildings. Design it so you can turn them on whenever
you like.</P>

<P>&quot;Every carrier must ensure that it's equipment allows for interception
of a communication concurrent with the transmission and provide call identifying
information to a remote government facility. Manufactures and support service
providers mustl also assist by developing equipment and software with these
capabilities. Providers have four years...to comply.&quot; -from the FBI's
proposed &quot;Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act of 1994.&quot;</P>

<P>Read it and weep.</P>

<P>In the tradition of Hoover, the FBI has been flacking in Congress for
approval of its &quot;Digital Telephony and Privacy Improvement Act&quot;
of 1994. This proposed law would legalize a computerized universal surveillance
system on the digital telephone network. That's right: The automatic Gestapo.</P>

<P>From the rarified heights of the Jane Edgar Hoover Headquarters Building,
FBI Director Freeh and Janet Reno are even offering to sweeten the deal.
They'll pay telephone companies $500 Million (in tax payers dollars) to
build the automatic Gestapo into their equipment. As if they had a choice.</P>

<P>Then telephone subscribers will get stuck with the monthly bill for
maintaining and expanding the system. And what a system.</P>

<P>The FBI's prototype systems-&quot;Smart Boxes&quot; developed by Bell
South-are secret, unaccountable and virtually undetectable. They work by
remote control and can automatically bug your house through the microphones
in your telephones.</P>

<P>According to the specifications for Bell South's Smart Boxes, just one
of these wonderful gadgets can snoop on an entire residential neighborhood.
The box offers America's secret police several different levels of surveillance,
depending on the amount of interest in the subject.</P>

<P>At the basic level the device is programmed to record all the phone
numbers the victim calls, and the phone numbers of everyone who calls the
victim. 64 kilobytes of storage is provided to store the compressed telephone
data. Every day, the box automatically sends this compressed log of phone
numbers to its master computer for storage and profiling.</P>

<P>For industrial-strength surveillance, Smart Boxes can be programmed
to record everything that passes over the digital phone line. Conversations,
faxes, data calls and video. The box has its own high-speed line for sending
these interceptions to its master computer-possibly thousands of miles
away.</P>

<P>Another program option lets the automatic Gestapo give especially interesting
victims the full Congressional treatment: continuous, 24-hour monitoring
of every room with a telephone.</P>

<P>WITH ENOUGH SHOEBOXES...</P>

<P>The technical lynchpin of this leviathan is the new generation of blindingly
powerful computers. These feature parallel procesor architectures and utilize
self-teaching AI software. They're already being deployed on the nation's
business and financial networks. These systems can automatically snoop
on financial transactions, create &quot;profiles&quot; of the people who
make the transactions, and store the information for later analysis.</P>

<P>In particular, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part
of the Treasury Department headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, has created
a system with enough computing power to scan all of the nation's interbank
networks and profile money movements, cash transactions, and credit card
purchases.</P>

<P>FinCEN's scanning and profiling operation uses high-powered mainframe-type
computers and works in near-real-time. It is also reported to rely on pattern-matching
AI software to identify neighborhoods-or people-with large amounts of cash
or other tangible assets. Pretty impressive.</P>

<P>Not long after Hitler gained power in Germany, his government started
gathering information on &quot;undesirables.&quot; The Nazis were so bend
on finding undesirables that they didn't stop at their own borders. They
recruited collaborators in other countries who contributed their undesirables
to the cause.</P>

<P>Within 10 yeras, these undesirables were being rounded up througout
Europe. In France, Holland, Poland, Hungary, Aurtria-wherever the Nazis
went, they were prepared with the names of their soon-to-be-victims.</P>

<P>They arrested at least 15 million people. And they did it all with shoeboxes
full of notecards.</P>

<P>FLESH EATER</P>

<P>KILLER BACTERIA'S GRISLY BODY COUNT</P>

<P>Could This Disease Be Worse Than AIDS?</P>

<P>Taken from HIGH SOCIETY (DEC 1994) by Gary Burdick</P>

<P>When James Richter cut kis knee cleaning his garage on a Sunday morning,
he noticed a rash forming around the bandage. After all, he was a healthy
27-year-old man, an ex-Marine who'd never been sick a day in his life.</P>

<P>But the thing kept spreading. Soon, his leg was throbbing and covered
with ugly red blisters. When the skin started turning black, he let his
wife drive him to the hospital. While he was waiting in the Emergency Room,
he began feeling nauseous and dizzy. Interns at the souther California
hospital cut away the dead skin and disinfected the wound.</P>

<P>By evening, Richter was running a high fever and vomiting. Even morphine
couldn't revieve the excruciating pain. At midnight, his leg was amputated
and he was pumped full of penicillin in a desperate attempt to stop the
infection. Nothing worked. While his family and physicians looked on helplessly,
the disease tunneled beneath his skin, devouring his groin and bladder.
By morning, his left kidney had shut down and there was nothing left of
his stomach. He died at 10 a.m, less than a day after he'd cut himself
on the knee. &quot;It was right out of a science-fiction movie,&quot; said
his brother-in-law, Jim Dentoni, &quot;like some creature from outer space
ate him alive.&quot;</P>

<P>John Richter succumbed to a disease that destroys flesh like high powered
acid-and can kill within hours. In recent months, the deadly germ has swept
across the globe, leaving behind a trail of death, causing more terror
than any scourage since the Black Plague.</P>

<P>And there are more reports of this disease striking every day. Could
this plague become the next AIDS? There are more than 80 different strains
of invasive Grade A beta streptococcus, the group of bacteria that cause
the disease. One hundred million of these tiny invaders can fit on the
head of a pin. They live in the throat, nasal passages, and skind of about
10 to 20 percent o fthe population, and are passed from one person to another
during a kiss or when someone sneezes or coughs. But the bacterium cause
little or no symptoms in most of us. &quot;Exposed to the same strep germ,
one kid in a family may get off lightly with strep throat, while another
child in the same house may have a severe complication,&quot; explained
Dr. Stan Kondraki of the New York State Department of Health.</P>

<P>Group A strep played a starring role in the repeated outbreaks of rheumatic
fever that killed thousands of children each year in the first half of
this century. In recent years, less overcrowded conditions and the use
of antibiotics have ketp the disease at bay. Some physicians even called
the waning plague of rheumatic fever a &quot;vanishing disease in suburbia.&quot;</P>

<P>However, in the mid-1980s, doctors began seeing new and more lethal
kinds of strep A infections. One variety of the disease, known as toxic
shock-like syndrome (TSLS), starts as a simple cold and quickly blossoms
intoa deadly form of pneumonia. TSLS made headlines around the world several
years ago when it reportedly claimed Sesame Street Muppeteer Jim Henson.</P>

<P>The infection becomes even nastier when it invades the bloodstream.
The bacterium produce toxins that gobble up human tissue at the rate of
an inch an hour. One condition, known as necrotizing fasciitis, eats away
at flesh, while another pyomyositis, consumes muscle. Both forms cause
high fever, severe pain, low blood pressure, vomiting, and diarrhea. Patients
usually die of heart of respiratory failure when what's left of their organs
shut down. Those luck enough to survive the diesase are often horribly
disfigured and may need years of cosmetic surgery and psychiatric counseling.</P>

<P>&quot;This is much worse than syphilis ever was,&quot; insists becterial
pathogenesis expert Alice Prince of Columbia. Presbyterian Medical Center.
&quot;Even before penicillin, syphilis ate through the tissue really slowly.
It took a long time to kill you. But necrotizing fasciitis grows right
before your eyes.&quot; Chicago Registered Nurse Lois Shane calls the gangrene-like
condition &quot;the most frightening thing I've seen in over 30 years of
nursing.&quot;</P>

<P>Despite the seriousness of the disease, it escaped public attention
until last spring, when the British press began reporting a number of people
who'd been infected by a &quot;mysterious flesh-eating bug.&quot; James
Anderson, 57, of Andover, Hampshire, died within hours of being admitted
to a hospital as the bacterium chewed up his shoulder and upper arms. Gillian
Wilkinson, a 48-year-old school teacher, developed necrotizing fasciitis
after an ankle infection suddenly ulcerated. &quot;We thought she had the
flu-she was shaking and had a temperature,&quot; said her husband, Frank.
&quot;Then the flesh on her ankle went black and died. It was so rapid
it wasn't true.&quot; By cutting away large areas of dead flesh from her
stomach and groin, surgeons managed to save Roseann Millar, 41, a nurse
who became infected after undergoing a hysterctomy. She had to have five
operations and extensive plastic surgery in order to hide the scars. &quot;I
have lived through everyone's worst nightmare,&quot; she told reporters,
&quot;watching something eat my body.&quot;</P>

<P>At first, it was believed the disease only struck those patients who'd
recently had surgery, or some type of skin wound, or suffered from an immune
disorder. Doctors were baffled by the case of Terry Bowden, a healthy 34-year-old
manual laborer. Short after cooking breakfast for his family, Bowden began
to experience flu-like symptoms. A few hours later, he developed pyomyositis,
which began gnawing at the muscles in his leg. &quot;He said the pain was
like something was going to explode in his leg,&quot; recalled his wife,
Christine. Despite emergency surgery, the father of four died the next
day. &quot;He was strong as an ox, never ill,&quot; said his widow. &quot;One
moment he was fine, and then I'd lost him.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian Bounds, a young plumber from Wales, was taken to the hospital
complaining of leg pains, believing he had strained a leg muscle. He too
died suddenly of the infection, although he had no wound or previous illness.
Siad Lorraine Black, his sister, &quot;It was terrible. Brian was there
with us one day and just gone the next. The speed of this is just horrifying.&quot;
Even doctors are helpless against the diesase. Dr. David Somervell, a retired
GP, had his leg amputated after a two-month life-and-death battle with
the infection. &quot;He became seriously ill too quickly to diagnose what
was causing it,&quot; explained his wife, Margaret. &quot;How he got it
is a mystery. It just started in his leg and began spreading.&quot;</P>

<P>In the past year, the bizarre disease has also survaced in Scandinavia,
Australia, East Germany, Canada, and New Zealand, as well as in the United
States. The bacterium left a Maryland woman with out a face, and consumed
every bit of skin and muscle covering the abdominal wall of a kindergarten-age
boy from New York. Thirty infants in a California hospital were infected
with toxic strep through smallpox lesions on their skin. Three of the children
later died of necrotizing fasciitis.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, doctors in Norwalk, Connecticut, were forced to amputate
the arm of a 30-year-old man who was stricken with the disease after cutting
his elbow. In Pompano Beach, Florida, 37-year-old Steven Hillman awoke
in the middle of the night in such pain that &quot;it felt like a hot branding
iorn was put on my butt.&quot; Within hours, a small pimple on his buttocks
grew into a nasty boil and then mushroomed into a huge, blistering infection.
&quot;If I hadn't come to the hospital when I did, my doctors told me that
five hours later my wife might have found a corpse in our bed,&quot; a
grateful Hillman recalled.</P>

<P>Florence Torburg, a Long Island woman whose husband developed a monstrous
rash on his back, compared his wound to something out of Jaws. &quot;It
looks like a shark took a great bigt bite out of him.&quot; An elderly
Greenwich Village woman died in agony last May soon after being admitted
to a New York hospital. &quot;One day she was battling what seemed to be
a bad cold,&quot; said a close relative. &quot;Later that week she was
in the hospital fighting for her life. She was in so much pain. Every time
they thought they had licked it, it appeared somewhere else.&quot; A recent
study in the New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 20 patients
in one hospital caught the horrifying disease after being infected by surgeons
and nurses who carried Strep A bacteria in their noses and other body cavities.</P>

<P>As reports of new cases continued to mount, terrified people on both
sides of the Atlantic rushed to emergency rooms. &quot;We must have seen
a hundred people last week who thought they were dying of necrotizing fasciitis,&quot;
remarked Dr. Miles Jenkins, a resident at one of Miami's largest public
hospitals. &quot;Most of them had insect bites, or were having bad hair
days.&quot;</P>

<P>Meanwhile, medical experts tried to reassure the public. &quot;This
is a very rare manifestation of strepococcus A, and people should know
that it is highly unlikely that a healthy individual will get sick from
this,&quot; explained microbiologist Dr. Henery Isenberg. &quot;It's not
a highly infectious disease running rampant through the United States,&quot;
insisted strep researcher Vincent Fischetti. The U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention announced that the number of cases of necrotizing
fasciitis reported during 1993, approximately 2,000, was well within normal
limits. &quot;You have twice as good a chance of dying in a car accident,&quot;
said a spokesman for the agency.</P>

<P>However, Dr. Leslie Speyer, a bacteriologist who has studied necrotizing
fasciitis, says the condition is definately on the rise and becoming more
lethal. This respected health care professional believes the medical community
is understating the danger in order to prevent public panic. &quot;How
can the Centers for Disease Control tell us there is no apparent increase
in the number of cases when Strep A is not even reportable?&quot; Speyer
asks. Dr. Speyer says the widespread use of antibiotics has created a new
strain of streptococcus Type A bacteria that produced a far more deadly
toxin. &quot;It's constantly change, learning new tricks.&quot;</P>

<P>Speyer's colleagues agree. &quot;There's definately an increase in serious
strep A infections,&quot; reports Dr. Alice Prince. Rosemary Roberts, M.D,
an offical of the Food and Drug Administration, says, &quot;We're seeing
more invasive strains of Group A strep that are making people much sicker
more quickly.&quot; Dr. Arthur Yee, of Norwalk HOspital in Connecticut,
warns that the Strep A strain &quot;could be mutating&quot; and that many
more patients might die from the debilitating disease in the near future.</P>

<P>Bowing to public pressure, the Centers for Disease Control announced
last May that it will begin tracking the infection for the first time.
The World Health Organization, an agency of the United Nations, is planning
to establish a network of surveillance centers that would provide specialists
around the globe with advice on how to recognize and treat the disease.
Researchers have come up with a new test using silicon chips that enables
doctors to tell within minutes whether a patient is carrying group A streptococcus
germs.</P>

<P>But it may already be too late to stop the spread of the murderous disease.
French doctors studying an outbreak of necrotizing fasciitis in the Brussels
are recently discovered a strain of toxic strep that seem to be immune
to all forms of antibiotics.</P>

<P>There is even more to this story. Most frighteningly, Strep A isn't
the only type of bacteria that can devous flesh and msucle. &quot;There
are a number of different viruses that can cause the condition. Unfortunately
we dcon't know much about them yet,&quot; explains a worried Dr. Speyer.
&quot;You hate to sound like an alarmists. But unless we start taking this
disease seriously, we're going to end up with a world wide scourge that's
going to make the AIDS epidemic look like the common cold.&quot;</P>

<P>WATCH THAT ITCH</P>

<P>Here are a few facts about this very deadly disease. Pay attention if
you want to be around to read the next issue of UMF MAG:</P>

<P>* The elderly, and those who have recently had operations seem to be
the most likely to become infected. Also, those who already have other
illnesses, like diabetes, high blood pressure, poor circulation, or some
immune disorder, are vulnerable. However, virtually everyone is at risk.
Keep all cuts and wounds, no matter how small, clean and bandaged. Watch
for any sudden change in the size or shape of a rash or blister. Remember,
there's no way to completely guard against this kind of disease. It can
come out of nowhere. &quot;It's like being struck by lighting. There's
little you can do to avoid it,&quot; warns Dr. John Flaherty of the University
of Chicago Medical Center.</P>

<P>* The first signs of the killer bacteria include reddened and inflamed
skin, possibly with blistering, fever, severe pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.
If you have any of these symptoms, don't be macho. Hey, we're talking about
something that can chomp on your flesh here. Get to a hospital fast! Physicians
have found that nutritional support helps combat the disease. So while
you're on your way, try to eat foods high in protein and calories.</P>

<P>* When you get to the hospital, don't be shy. The interns at most emergency
rooms don't have enough experience to recognize the disease immediately.
They're not likely to admit someone with a rash and a sore throat ahead
of a stabbing victim or someone with a gunshot wound. If you think you've
been infected by flesh-eating bacteria, let the medical staff know about
it. &quot;There's nothing wrong with a patient suggesting a diagnosis,&quot;
explains Dr. Alice Prince. &quot;And if they tell you you're wrong, ask
them to explain why it's not possible.&quot; Suggest that they take a CAT
scan of the infected area to confirm the existence of the disease. &quot;They
key to treating this disease is catching it early,&quot; says respected
Dr. Colin Messing. &quot;A delay of even a few minsutes can mean the difference
between life and death.&quot;</P>

<P>G. Gordon Liddy: BATF's Worst Nightmare</P>

<P>taken from GUN NEWS Digest / Spring 1995</P>

<P>supplied by The P/\NTHER/UMF</P>

<P>The meteoric rise of the &quot;G. Gordon Liddy Show&quot; is one of
network radio's most amazing success stories. But it's also the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' worst nightmare.</P>

<P>Hardly a weekday goes by that Liddy doesn't blast the BATF as a bunch
of incompetent boobs, would-be Navy SEALS who wage war on the American
people. He has labeled the killings of the Branch Davidians at Waco, TX,
as simple murder and made no secret of his disdain for BATF agents.</P>

<P>What makes these remarks all the more telling is that Liddy was in charge
of trying to clean up some of BATF's messes back in the Nixon Administration.</P>

<P>Liddy's involvement in the Watergate affair made his name a household
word-and landed him five years in prison for steadfastly refusing to implicate
others. Much of that time was spend in maximum security with 106 days in
solitary confinement. President Carter finally pardoned him &quot;in the
interests of justice.&quot;</P>

<P>Since then you may have seen Liddy as an actor in the movies and on
television. He likes to kid that his wife says he usually plays the &quot;bad
guy&quot; because that way it really doesn't require any acting. He also
has authored three best selling books and numerous magazine articles and
is editor-in-chief of The Liddy Letter, a monthly newsletter.</P>

<P>But it is the practically overnight huge success of his radio talk show
that has propelled Liddy's name into the headlines in a way that it has
not been since Nixon was in the White House.</P>

<P>Liddy's program began on one radio station - WJFK in Washington, DC
- in February 1992 and immediately shot to the top of the Washington ratings.
In April 1993 the &quot;G. Gordon Liddy Show&quot; was launched as a nationally
syndicated radio program and awed the industry as the fastest talk show
launch in history, picking up 100 affiliates in as many days. That number
has hit more than 220 stations by now and is still rising.</P>

<P>The reason for his success is obvious. He approached the hot topics
addressed on his program in a frank, outspoken manner; gives callers who
disagree a chance to voice their opinions without ridicule; and displays
a keen sense of humor-such as referring to The Washington Post as The Washington
Bleep, as if its real name is too obscene to say on radio. In short, Liddy
comes across as more in love with life and ideas than himself.</P>

<P>One thing he clearly is not in love with is the BATF. When I noted that
his dislike of BATF clearly predates the Waco incident, Liddy replied,
&quot;That's because when I arrived in Washington in '69 as a special assistant
to the Secretary of the Treasury, I had duties in the area of gun control.</P>

<P>&quot;I was actually under the assistant secretary (for enforcement)
Gene Rossides, at the time. Gene didn't know which end of the tube a round
came out of. He was a city boy from New York. I took care of all that for
him.</P>

<P>&quot;The first thing I knew we were terribly embarrassed by the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. There was the Ken Bellew incident (the
shooting of an innocent gunowner), and it just went downhill from there.</P>

<P>&quot;BATF had made this motion picture on the Gun Control Act of 1968
that was the most ridiculous thing that I had ever seen. We tried to round
up every copy of that thing that we could and destroy it because it was
a distortion of the law. It also was quite anti-gun.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then there was the famous incident after I was the primary author
of the Explosives Control Act,&quot; Liddy added. &quot;That was given
to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to administer.</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'All right, we're going to have a big press do.'</P>

<P>&quot;They had gotten a brand new scientific van-sort of a mobile laboratory.
They said, 'You go down there where they are going to blow up an outhouse
or something. Life magazine and everybody is going to be down there. They're
going to film it.'</P>

<P>&quot;And I said, 'Why do I have to go down there?'</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'Well, they might have some question on the law. You
wrote the law, so you should down there and just field those questions.'</P>

<P>&quot;So I went down there, and I was just hanging out by the van because
I didn't want any part of blowing up the outhouse. I figured this crew
would probably blow me up-and themselves by mistake.</P>

<P>&quot;They came to get the van and said, 'We're going to take the van.'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'Where do you think you are going to go with that?'</P>

<P>&quot;They said, 'We're going to go down there with the press and they're
going to film the thing.'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'No you're not.'</P>

<P>&quot;They said,'Why not?'</P>

<P>&quot;I said, 'Well, look at the side of it.'</P>

<P>&quot;They had just put their big logo on there -Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms; and they had misspelled 'firearms.' And I didn't
want to embarrass the Treasury further.&quot;</P>

<P>When asked if he had caught any flak for urging people not to obey gun
laws that violate their Second Amendment rights, Liddy responded, &quot;An
occasional person will disagree with me. But that's it. Whatever flak could
I catch?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a free country. They can't come and take my guns away. I
don't have any. (As a convicted felon, he is not allowed to own any firearms.)</P>

<P>&quot;I don't have any guns, don't have any licenses. &quot;And I go
to gun shows, but I carefully don't buy anything. I just look.&quot;</P>

<P>As any listener to his program knows, Liddy is equally critical of President
Clinton. He says he knows why Clinton has shown such fervor in his drive
to ban assault weapons.</P>

<P>&quot;Because Clinton - having proved a coward when it was his turn
to serve - is unfamiliar with these weapons,&quot; Liddy said. &quot;He
really doesn't know what an assault weapon is.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The weapons look military. Anything that even looks military scares
a guy like Billy Boy Clinton. And so they demonize them because of their
military appearance.</P>

<P>&quot;You and I know how you can get a good bolt-action high powered
rifle and you can go through a heck of a lot more than you can with a medium-powered,
so called assault weapon.</P>

<P>&quot;And if you really want to do some damage, get yourself a cylinder
bore 12-guage shotgun with 00 buck. But they wouldn't think of banning
that.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no. They're going to ban this other thing because it's got
a bayonet lug, and we've got to stop all those drive-by bayonetings that
are happening.&quot;</P>

<P>Liddy said he does expect the Republican controlled Congress to attempt
to remove at least some of the anti-gun measures from the Crime Bill.</P>

<P>But he added, &quot;You've got to remember that Clinton - at least for
the next two years - is still the President of the United Sates. He can
veto.</P>

<P>&quot;So I think the tactic probably will be to take out some of the
more absurd stuff-like magazine capacity. At least, this would be my suggestion.</P>

<P>&quot;When they come across a bill that Clinton desperately needs and
wants, just put that magazine capacity thing on it and say, 'Take it or
leave it.'&quot;</P>

<P>There's no doubt in Liddy's mind that the Second Amendment guarantees
an individual right to keep and bear arms, despite the claims of groups
like the American Bar Association (ABA).</P>

<P>&quot;The American Bar Association on this-as on so many issues-is full
of beans. It is quite clear and the courts have held that it's an individual
right...</P>

<P>&quot;The thing I like about the Founding Fathers is that they were
master craftsmen with the English language. The reason they said 'shall
not be infringed' is that they were recognizing that as a free human being,
one of the rights you are endowed with by your creator is to be armed.
&quot;And they simply said we-in forming the government and having this
Constitution-will not infringe that. Period. It's not to be infringed.
ANy anything that contravenes that contravenes the Constitution.</P>

<P>&quot;So I just tell people it's unconstitutional. You no more should
obey that law than you should obey a law that says if you're black, go
to the back of the bus.&quot;</P>

<P>As a former Army artillery officer, special agent of the FBI, international
lawyer and a prosecutor, Liddy has more than a passing interest in firearms.
He loves to shoot. And what does he shoot?</P>

<P>&quot;It's more a matter of what I don't shoot,&quot; Liddy said. &quot;I
like handguns the most. All the handguns I shoot are owned by Mrs. Liddy.
I don't own any. I cannot legally do so in as much as I have felony convictions
on my record.</P>

<P>&quot;But occasionally I'll go out to the range with Mrs. Liddy and
with other friends-private ranges usually, over in Virginia. We all shoot
and we interchange the various firearms that are owned by the people who
are attending the shoot. We all share and share alike.</P>

<P>&quot;I've fired everything. My favorite for target is the .38 wadcutter,
mid-range, which I fire out of a Smith &amp; Wesson Combat Masterpiece
with a target trigger and a target hammer spur-broad-hammer spur. It's
got a ramp-front sight and adjustable rear sights.</P>

<P>&quot;Similarly with .357 Magnums.</P>

<P>&quot;A .45 Model 1911. That's the straight back that was carried in
the First World War by my grandfather, which is now owned by Mrs. Liddy.</P>

<P>&quot;A 9mm parabellum P-35 Browning Highpower, Mrs. Liddy has that
also.</P>

<P>&quot;Similar pieces owned by friends, all the way up to fully automatic
weapons legally owned by friends.</P>

<P>&quot;We fire high power rifles.</P>

<P>&quot;And shotguns. I like trap over skeet, but I've shot both. I haven't
done this new sporting clays stuff. It's very popular. I keep hearing about
it, but I have yet to shoot it.</P>

<P>&quot;I've fired-owned by various members of my family-AR-15's, H-Bars,
the M-1A (which is the semi-automatic version of the M-14) and the Garand,
which was the piece that I was trained with. When I went into the service,
that was the standard issue.</P>

<P>&quot;I guess you would call it the main battle rifle now to try to
distinguish it from an assault weapon. Of course, I understand a true assault
weapon is one capable of fully automatic fire with the flip of a selector
switch.</P>

<P>&quot;You name it, and I've probably fired it.&quot;</P>

<P>But will future generations of Americans be able to enjoy this same
sport? Will Americans have a right to keep and bear arms 50 years from
now?</P>

<P>&quot;Yes!&quot; Liddy declares emphatically. &quot;There's the Constitution.
The only way you can take that away from us is to amend the Constitution.</P>

<P>&quot;What the American people have to do is keep control of Congress-especially
the Senate, keep control of the White House, get the right Supreme Court
justices in there and be as damm sure on this, as people are on other touchstone
issues.</P>

<P>&quot;If worse comes to worse, what you can do is you can restrict the
jurisdiction on this issue of the Supreme Court. Congress has the right
to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.&quot;</P>

<P>Liddy said the recent elections encourage his belief that Americans
are waking up to the threat to their Second Amendment rights.</P>

<P>&quot;The gun issue was a big, big issue in these elections,&quot; Liddy
said, &quot;They (the anti-gunners) have gone too far.</P>

<P>&quot;And, of course, you've had all this horrible stuff: the out-of-control
FBI hostage rescue team and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
making war on the American people.</P>

<P>&quot;I'd like to see a big push to investigate and find out how much
assistance those people were given by the armed forces. That's a violation
of the Posse Comitatus Act.</P>

<P>&quot;I'd like to stop all armed forces participation with law enforcement.
That shouldn't be happening.&quot;</P>

<P>The French newspaper Le Monde once labeled Liddy &quot;a man of extraordinary
intellect and complexity,&quot; an appropriate description for a man who,
at age 29, became the youngest Bureau supervisor at FBI national headquarters.</P>

<P>William F. Buckley Jr. described Liddy as possessing &quot;superhuman
character,&quot; while historian William H. White labeled him &quot;the
most dangerous man in America.&quot;</P>

<P>Liberal television talk show host Larry King said of Liddy, &quot;He's
totally himself, totally honest...He has passion, flair. He's just extraordinary.
A man's man.&quot;</P>

<P>But whatever else this bright extremely successful, strong willed person
is, G. Gordon Liddy clearly is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms'
worst nightmare.</P>

<P>Down to Earth UFO Abduction Research</P>

<P>An Interview with Budd Hopkins</P>

<P>by Kerri Parry</P>

<P>from the Wole Life Times April 1995 supplied by The P/\NTHER</P>

<P>Picture this: You're minding your own business, driving down the street
towards home when up above, you see a silver aircraft hovering-definitely
not a helicopter or anything you've ever seen before-with flicking, colored
lights. You stop and turn down your radio to see if it makes any noise.</P>

<P>The next thing you remember, it's dark out and you're driving down the
street again. You look at your watch: it's 9pm. You should have been home
hours ago.</P>

<P>What happened? According to Budd Hopkins, you may have been abducted
by UFOs. Called &quot;Ufology's most visible figure since the death of
J. Allen Hynek, &quot;this abduction researcher described such scenarios
in his 1981 book Missing Time and went on to explore the subject of alien/human
hybirds in the 1987 book Intruders (the subject of a CBS television miniseries
in 1992), books that were devoted to findings from his painstaking research
into UFO abductions. With help from a fellow UFO researcher and psychologist,
Hopkins performed countless interviews and hypnosis sessions on UFO abductees
to form case studies. What they found was not pleasant: involuntary human
subjects were subjected to implants and sperm and ova sampling, among other
things. Mothers were shown their half-human, half-alien children.</P>

<P>Also a New York City painter and sculptor, Hopkins has founded the Intruders
Foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to research and public education
about the UFO abduction phenomenon. Whole Life Times spoke with Hopkins
about his work.</P>

<P>* BEGIN INTERVIEW *</P>

<P>[Your last book, Intruders, came out in 1987. What has been the focus
of your research since then?]</P>

<P>Essentially what the focus was before-studying the abduction phenomenon
and looking for patterns that were unknown before. There have been a number
of these new patterns, and they have certainly occupied a lot of my thinking
since then. These might be called &quot;subsets&quot; because they're not
all that common, but there are some 12 cases where people have been abducted
as children and taken into another place, another situation with another
child. They are simply left alone to play and form relationships, and they're
abducted again and again. They may live in different cities; in one case
they lived on different continents. They are brought together and, it would
seem, the aliens are interested in watching how a relationship forms, between,
in most cases, members of the opposite sex.</P>

<P>What happens eventually in the cases I'm dealing with is the people
have actually run into their counterpart in the real world and thought,
&quot;My god, how do I know you?&quot; When you look into these cases,
it turns out they've been abducted and studied as a pair. So as a sort
of extension of the UFO occupants' interest in reproduction and this program
of mixing hybirds of them and us, they seem to be interested in how human
beings experience certain types of emotions. That's never been written
about in any length, but it's something I've run into a number of times.</P>

<P>[Why do you think certain individuals are chosen as abductees? Is it
random?]</P>

<P>People seem to be chosen across certain blood lines and families. If
a woman is an abductee and has two children, it is likely that one or more
of her children will also be abductees. I have cases which go across four
generations. So it would seem there is this interest in following a particular
set of genes and its various permutations. We don't really know, but that's
a good guess. If people are abducted when they are tiny children-I have
one case where a baby was taken from the hospital when it was one day old-if
these things happen from childhood on, then obviously whatever they're
interested in is already present in that child to start with.</P>

<P>[What are some of the symptoms by which one might recognize a personal
abduction experience?]</P>

<P>The most obvious sympton is having a very clear, conscious memory of
abduction. Now to go to the much more subtle: childhood sleep difficulties,
recurring nightmares which have a UFO component to them, fears of certain
places, certain kinds of phobias which don't make much sense. One man was
afraid to go out at night and walk into any kind of open field because
he was afraid he would &quot;fall up.&quot;</P>

<P>Another person might say he's absolutely terrified of cockroaches, and
I'll say, &quot;Well, they're certainly not pleasant; you're afraid they'll
get into your food,&quot; and then try to lead away, not using anything
UFO-like. Then he'll say, &quot;No, their huge staring eyes, and the way
they stare at you,&quot; which is not the way we thing about cockroaches!</P>

<P>If you look at this as a medical metaphor, like a high fever or an itch
on the kneecap, you name it, any symptom alone could be anything. But in
conjunction with, say, six other symptoms, you have to take it seriously
as perhaps being representative of a certain pathology.</P>

<P>[Then how do you determine if it's the bona fide thing?]</P>

<P>Well, I would then examine a person's collection of his phobias and
fears, and try to find out if a person has had any missing time experiences
that are unexplained. An example might be a trip in the car that is supposed
to take an hour and it takes three hours and he can't remember anything,
but he feels real funny!</P>

<P>Then I make inquiries into his dream life. People very often have this
unbelievable fear of going to a doctor, gynecological exam, or the dentist-fears
that are in excess of what they could understand as being logical. Soem
of what one does ina n interview is inquire into many different areas of
a person's expericnce and see what kinds of symptomns recur.</P>

<P>I've done a lot of work with children who were abductees, and when you're
working with children, I ask a different set of questions. One man remembered
that as a little boy, when his mother pointed out a praying mantis, he
started talking to it. His mother said, &quot;Bugs don't talk.&quot; He
said, &quot;No, this kind of bug talks!&quot; Another little boy made some
drawings of aliens and put a huge ear, just one ear, on the side of each
head. He said, &quot;They don't really have ears, but they can hear everything
you're saying.&quot;</P>

<P>[Do the abductions seem to happen only by &quot;grey&quot; aliens?]</P>

<P>There are other types that are described. Some seem to have a more insect-like
appearance; some people use the analogy of a praying mantis. Essentially,
you see the gray figures in 85% of the reports. There's a number of reports
of what seem to be normal humans and also people who seem to be hybirds:
part human, part alien. But they all seem, together, to be doing the same
thing.</P>

<P>[They all want to observe you, or put in an implant...]</P>

<P>Yes, implants, or alleged implants, have been found. A number of them
have been studied, and they are quite unusual, but they are not something
all science would agree could not have been produced on earth. The problem
is that all the elements on Earth are the elements of the Universe, and
how would we recognize an object that could not possibly have originated
on Earth? An implant could be made of earthly materials, so how do we recognize
it? It's not as easy an issue as one would imagine.</P>

<P>[In Intruders you surmised that the abduction phenomenon could either
be reality or a soft of universal psychological phenomenon. Have you come
any further in deciding which it is?]</P>

<P>I don't have any doubt that it's physically real. Somebody asked me
once, &quot;Is this really happening in the real world?&quot; I said, &quot;I
no longer have the luxury of disbelief about it.&quot; We're stuck with
it. It's not very pleasant to deal with. One thing I want to say that's
important is that though we know it's going on, and we know that they're
doing, at least an awful lot of them, we don't know any of the answers
to any of the big questions-like what's it going to be like 100 years from
now, where do they come from, what do they ultimately intend for us? We
don't have any of those answers. When somebody once said, &quot;This is
like a cult,&quot; I said, &quot;Well, it's the exact opposite of a cult,
if you think of a cult as the Rev. Moon or something like that. Moonies
are all beliefs and no miracles. We're all miracles and no beliefs.&quot;</P>

<P>And, I must say, I'm not given a lot of speculation. For me, it's a
lot of wheel-spinning. So when people start talking, &quot;Oh, I hink they're
time travelers, &quot;No, I think they're inter-dimensionals,&quot; I just
sort of throw up my hands and say, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</P>

<P>[Besides abductees and researchers such as yourself, is anyone else
showing concern over this phenomenon?]</P>

<P>Mental health professionals, as a group, have had a larger percentage
taking this issue very seriously than any other group that I'm aware of.
I've spoken to maybe 1,000 mental health professionals over the years and
apart from the fact that I've so far had seven psychiatrists come to me
about their own abduction experiences-and a number of psychologists and
therapists that are abductees-it seems to be, as a group, that many of
them share a great interest in this subject. I think it's because they're
very aware of the anomalies of human behavior. If you have people who are
showing signs of, say, childhood sexual abuse, and there's absolutely no
sexual abuse that can be located in anyone in the family, and the child
remembers certain things that blend with memories that have to do with
the realm of huge black eyes and finding oneself outside and a whole group
of things, the mental health people are aware that maybe there is an unusual
phenomena at work here that's outside of their normal range of training
and expertise. But we certainly hear more from them that we do from, say,
physicists or astronomers who are the first to say you can't get here from
there, or &quot;These people's experiences can't be!&quot;</P>

<P>[What about the government?]</P>

<P>Well, we know there's a cover-up on this. I don't think ther's any doubt,
because the government was investigating UFOs through the Air Force officially
up until 1969, and then they announced they were getting out of looking
into the subject at all. But when the Freedom of Information Act was passed
and we requested documents, we received many documents from all the branches
of government, at least the investigative ones, dealing with UFO investigatino
carried out after 1969. You can't say you're stopping it, and then have
all this evidence that you're not stopping it without saying that is, ipso
facto, a kind of cover-up.</P>

<P>[Tell us about the organizatino you founded, the Intruders Foundation.]</P>

<P>There are three different things we do. One is working with abductees
and referring them to other investigators and therapists around the country,
and a few in foreign countries. I'm still getting about two new potential
cases a day, and the first thing we do is get these people some help, because
they want to find out what happened to them. If hypnosis or therapy is
called for, we try to get some help. The second thing is research, trying
to put together the accounts of what's happening and determining the patterns,
what keeps happening again and again. The third thing is public education.</P>

<P>[In terms of popular culture, it seems like UFOs are coming more into
the mainstream. We're seeing more movies, more television shows and so
forth, devoted to the topic. Any thoughts on this?]</P>

<P>I think the reason is that the media is out to make a buck. There's
public interest in it, which means money, and therefore they're catering
to that. It's an interesting thing: when sweeps week comes along, everybody
calls me up and wants to do UFO this, UFO that. That lets you know that
there's an audience in it.</P>

<P>The X-FILES EXPOSED supplied by The P/\NTHER/UMF</P>

<P>&quot;Since the show started, people have sought me out. I was warned
about nutcases but these are regular folks. A banker will tell about his
experience with aliens. Pilots and flight attendants come up to me and
claim to have seen UFOs. One friend told me, 'You don't know how accurate
you are.' He broke down, telling me about his visitations. I've known this
person for two years. I have no reason not to believe him.&quot;-Chris
Carter, creator and executive producer, The X-Files.</P>

<P>Standing in the middle of his living room, FBI special agent Fox Mulder
is deep in conversation with a woman he believes is his long-lost sister
Samannnntha, abducted years ago by aliens. But. Mulder turns away from
her, struding past a Panavision camera into a hallway at a studio in Vancouver.
He slumps in a canvas chair and grabs a reporter's notebook. He starts
drawing something on the page. &quot;You won't admit that you're really
going to be writing what amounts to fiction,&quot; he says. &quot;It's
going to have your slant on it-not the truth. You're just trying to get
a handle on something, a handle on me.&quot; The notebook is retrieved.
The drawing is a bag with a handle on it. Next to the handle he has drawn
an arrow pointing to his real name: David Duchovny.</P>

<P>So when it comes to investigating the most provocative series on TV,
Fox's sleeper sci-fi hit, The X-Files, Duchovny seems to be echoing the
show's credo: The truth is out there-but it's not likely to be in here,
in the pages of a magazine. Or is it?</P>

<P>Since it's first sighting in 1993, The X-Files has defied skeptics who
refused to believe that a show about two deadpan FBI agents, played by
Duchovny, 34, and Gillian Anderson, 26, investigating paranormal activities
could succeed. But succeed it has. By skillfully blending post-Cold War,
antigovernment paranoia; old-fashioned conspiracy theory; sly humor; and
stories drawn from today's headlines (not to mention little green men and
beast-women), The X-Files beat out favorites like NYPD Blue and ER for
best drama series at the recent Golden Globes. Ratings have nearly doubled
since its debut, culminating in its first-ever-time-slow victory in households
with the conclusion of a recent two parter about the supposed return of
Mulder's sister, a story suggested in part by Duchovny&gt; &quot;I had
no idea this could happen,&quot; says the Hollywood-handsome Carter, 38,
a former surfing-magazine writer whose favorite should as a kid was Kolchak:
The Night Stalker. &quot;I wrote this in my office in my surf trunks, playing
with my dog. It never occurred to me that someday there'd be X-Files key
chains.&quot;</P>

<P>True, the show is beset by at least on Dark Force. Many X-Files episodes
are left unresolved, making them a hard sell in syndication. So Carter
too must battle strange life forms-the kind who wear Armani suits and dine
at Mortons. &quot;We have long, tedious arguments about the network's desire
for 'closure',&quot; sighs Carter. &quot;But it's hard to put handcuffs
on aliens every week and throw them in the slammer.&quot;</P>

<P>Nevertheless, all signs point to a possible Star Trek-like franchise.
The first X-Files convention will be held soon, probably in L.A.; a series
of official X-Files novels is hitting bookstores; Topps Comics is putting
out a monthly X-Files comic book; and Fox will release an X-Files CD later
this year. The phenom has also infiltrated cyberspace. Thousands of fans-they
call themselves &quot;X-Philes&quot; - have logged onto X-Files newsgroups
on the Internet and online services; America Online even lets subscribers
role-play in a game based on the series.</P>

<P>&quot;My dorm when I was studying in Munich was an old SS barracks that
was supposedly haunted. One night we were sitting around, making fun of
the spirits. At some point I went back to my room. There was a big brass
candlabra on the dresser. I knelt down to get into the closet and the candlabra
came crashing down and just missed my head. It was on a totally flat surface.
Nothing could have knocked it over. It was very weird. I apologized to
the spirits immediately.&quot; - Mitch Pileggi,a.k.a. X-Files FBI assistant
director Walter Skinner</P>

<P>Marooned for 10 months of the year in Vancouver, where they work under
such tight deadlines that some scripts have been written in less than 72
hours, Team X-Files find the show's exploding popularity a little, well,
suspicious. &quot;I'm fascinated by what they read into it,&quot; says
director-producer Rob Bowman, 34, who surfs on those often arcane X-Files
forums in cyberspace where viewers dig for signs and symbols in nearly
every scene. &quot;We don't have time to put in everything they think they
see.&quot;</P>

<P>Die-hard fans analyze and critique the show, expecially the sinister
fringe characters, such as Deep Throat, Mr. X, Cigarette Smoking Man, or
Crew Cut Man, like Talmudic scholars. A typical America Online posting
after a recent episode read: &quot;Did any other Douglas Adams [Hitchkiker's
Guide to the Galaxy] fans out there notice that Mulder's apartment number
is 42? It's the answer to the question of Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot;</P>

<P>Another hot topic is the soulful but platonic relationship between Fox
Mulder and Dana Scully. X-Philes swoon over the sexual tension, but Carter
swears his two stars will never have a close encounter of the sensual kind.
&quot;If they ever got too romantic,&quot; he says, &quot;you can imagine
them ignoring the aliens and genetic mutants and just staring into each
other's eyes.&quot;</P>

<P>The X-Files sometimes twist its more obsessive viewers. In one episode,
the three greasy-haired conspiracy theorist losers known as the Lone Gunmen
invite Mulder for an uproarious Saturday night &quot;netpicking&quot; on
the Internet. &quot;No thanks,&quot; the agent responds dryly in one of
his trademark Mulderisms, &quot;I have to do my laundry.&quot;</P>

<P>Of course, when it comes to the X-Files, one should remember the immortal
words of Mulder's mysterious ally (or is it enemy?) Deep Throat, who died
(or did he?) at the end of last season: &quot;Nothing is as it seems.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;My mother was raised by her uncle and they were very close. One
day, after she was grown up, her uncle died. That very day she'd written
him a letter and mailed it to him. [After learning that he'd died] she
went back to his house and went through his private papers. She found her
letter had been opened. And there was no one else who could have been there
to open it.&quot;-Tom Braidwood, a.k.a. one of the Lone Gunmen.</P>

<P>Both Duchovny, who has Mulder's dry wit and sardonic delivery, and Anderson,
who can be as eerily serene as her X-Files character, Dana Scully, work
up to 16 hours a day. Duchovny is a veteren of films like Kalifornia and
played the transvetite on Twin Peaks. Anderson, however, only had a few
stage and TV credits when the show began. They rarely socialize together
only &quot;because we see more of each other working than we do of anyone
else,&quot; says Anderson. Duchovny, alternately charming and brusque,
spends his free time in his spartan trailer with his dog, Blue. Anderson
dashes back to her trailer in between takes to be with her 5-month-old-daughter;
Piper.</P>

<P>On the show, Duchovny's character is the true believer: Mulder's quest
to find his sister, who he believes was abducted by aliens at age 8, drives
the show. (Carter says the sister will finally be found whenever the show
ends its run.) In real life, however, Duchovny is more of a doubter-at
times. &quot;I'm a skeptic of specifics, like the six-foot intestinal worm[in
the episode 'The Host'],&quot; he says.</P>

<P>Anderson, by contrast, who plays the pragmatic, scientific, ever-skeptical
Scully, says she's &quot;always had a basic belief in the paranormal.&quot;
Not long after arriving in Vancouver, she had even more reason to believe.</P>

<P>&quot;After my husband and I moved into our new house, I feld there
were spirits there with us. It was really creepy. It felt like there was
someone attached to me. We were told by a Native American that we lived
near an Indian burial ground. He said there had been a plague years ago
that wiped many of them out. There were a lot of souls in unrest. He came
to the house and performed this ritual called smudging in which herbs are
burned so as to purify the space. It was amazing. Afterward, it was like
the house got lighter. Whatever we felt had been there was gone.&quot;-Gillian
Anderson</P>

<P>Sounding very much like Scully describing Mulder, Anderson admits, &quot;We
have our ups and downs. At times it's difficult. We both tend to be quite
moody, but underneath I think we care about each other.&quot; They are
both coy about whether they ever considered dating, but Anderson will allow
that Duchovny is &quot;like catnip&quot; to women. When told this later,
Duchovny, soon to be featured in a Playgirl interview, notes. &quot;Just
call me David Ducatnip,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish I had the life people
think I have.&quot;</P>

<P>Unlike Mulder and Scully, who seem to have virtually no personal lives,
Duchovny and Anderson found mates soon after the show's debut. Duchovny's
L.A.-based girlfriend, actress Perrey Reeves, played a beautiful vampire
who spends the night with Mulder int he episode titled &quot;3&quot;. Anderson
married Errol Clyde Klotz, 33, a freelance art director on the show, four
months after meeting him and gave birth in September. &quot;It was intense,
everyone was mad at me,&quot; says Anderson of her pregnancy. &quot;It
was pretty ballsy of me, after getting such a big break. I was afraid they
were going to recast.&quot;</P>

<P>Instead, Anderson's abscence from the show led to one of its most compelling
storeis-last year's two-parter in which it seems that Scully is abducted
by aliens. Anderson returned to work 10 days after giving birth by cesarean
section. &quot;It was tough,&quot; she says, &quot;but now I have a beautiful
baby daughter.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I was in Ocean City, Maryland, in 1987. I looked up and saw something
that looked like a plane. I looked away for a second and it was gone. It
was low and big. I couldn't believe my eyes. I just glanced away for a
second and when I looked back it was gone.&quot;-David Duchovny</P>

<P>Duchovny, having morphed back into Mulder, is again in front of the
cameras. His &quot;sister&quot; (soon to be revealed as an impostor with
four clones) is warning him about an alien bounty hunter. Just a few feet
away, behind the set's fake backwall, a member of the production team speaks
in low, confidential tones.</P>

<P>This person, who does not want to be identified, talks guardedly about
what she says was her own abduction by aliens late last year: &quot;They
took us up in their ship,&quot; she says. &quot;It's hazy, it's hard to
remember, like a dream. They spoke, but it seemed like everything happened
telepathically. I do remember they had three fingers.&quot;</P>

<P>Duchovny, between scenes, pops out again and listens to the conversation
skeptically. &quot;On the other side of the wall, the sign above Mulder's
desk reads, &quot;I want to believe.&quot; You do too. But then you remember
the rule: Trust no one.</P>

<P>Monster in the Wilderness</P>

<P>by C. Zickuhr</P>

<P>The HAARP project being constructed near Gakona, Alaska will create
the largest-of-its-kind ionospheric heater using computer controlled radio
frequency transmitters. HAARP, which stands for High Frequency Active Auroral
Research Project, is a joint effort of the Air Force and the Navy. HAARP
program manager, John Heckscher, claims that it is a research project with
both military and civilian benefits yet only military experiments can be
found in the documentation for the project. The acronym implies something
to do with the aurora, but none of the project papers mention that aspect.
What sounds like an engineering feat deserving of public accolade, has
remained suspiciously low profile, almost unknown to most Alaskans as well
as the rest of the country.</P>

<P>Documents acquired from the Office of Naval Research via the Freedom
Of Information Act reveal a more ominous purpose for HAARP. According to
these documents, the U.S. military believes the former Soviet Union has
similar heaters with which they claim to have achieved higher levels of
ionospheric reaction than possible so far in the &quot;West&quot;. Although
smaller in size than the HAARP project, there are many other ground based
transmitting heaters in operation around the world; Tromso, Norway and
Arecibo, Puerto Rico among them. Can these heaters already be changing
the weather, and have they somehow contributed to the recent climate-based
catastrophes in the U.S? Might migratory species traveling through the
&quot;rays&quot; have already experienced irreversible damage? How many
humans have contracted cancers that might have remained dormant if not
&quot;excited&quot; by these transmissions? When Russia's Zhirinovsky speaks
of secret weapons, is he referring to their version of HAARP?</P>

<P>HAARP first came to my attention in the spring of 1993, when a neighbor
and airline pilot brought me materials on the project. The FAA had briefed
commercial pilots in Alaska on changes needed to avoid interference from
future HAARP transmissions. As a ham radio operator, my neighbor assumed
that I had some knowledge of the &quot;giant transmitter&quot; and its
effect on other communications. After making inquiries to other hams, a
few recalled seeing announcements for public meetings in Glenallen and
Anderson, Alaska. Several then attended these Draft Environmental Impact
meetings and gathered information.</P>

<P>FAA personnel, pilots, communications engineers and others raised serious
questions during the HAARP Draft Environmental Impact Statement process.
According to official statements, these questions were all properly addressed
in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). Closer examination
reveals a different story. Local FAA engineers, aware of the heavy safety
dependency of airplane communications, voiced strong objections. The national
FAA, however, overrode these objections and gave HAARP the green light
after &quot;assurances&quot; that lower level concerns would be accommodated.
The FEIS admits that all forms of radio communication are subject to interference,
yet completely ignores the concerns expressed in many of the comments.
Individuals, organizations and agencies that use radio for their day-to-day
livelihood were left with a &quot;let us know and we'll try to mitigate
it&quot; promise. It is important to remember the definition of mitigation
is &quot;to reduce&quot;, not &quot;to eliminate&quot;. What recourse does
the Alaskan Bush communicator have when their radio transmissions are rendered
useless by HAARP? That is their only form of communication.</P>

<P>The FEIS and other Department of Defense documents indicate that interference
problems would be too great to allow it to be located near other military
facilities in Alaska. What kind of monster is it that they can't even locate
it near existing military bases? Even the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA) has reservations about HAARP transmissions.
They would only permit one of the test sites (Mineral Wells, Texas) to
operate and so far have declined to extend all the requested frequency/power
privileges necessary for the Alaska site. The enormous lobbying power of
the military may overwhelm reason and force the NTIA to go along with the
HAARP request. After all, Gakona is a &quot;virtually uninhabited&quot;
area of the world.</P>

<P>Electromagnetic radiation has drawn increasing interest in the form
of health impact studies and research worldwide. The HAARP project will
generate massive amounts of intentional and some unintentional radiation.
The HAARP environmental impact statements deny possible biological effects
on humans, citing obsolete IEEE standards that basically say if the radiation
isn't causing you to feel heat, it does not harm you. The preponderance
of current studies indicate there can by promotion of cancer growth, disorientation,
and other negative physical effects from low level, non-heating electromagnetic
radiation. Why have our government agencies given their affirmation to
something so clearly controversial?</P>

<P>After searching for answers to HAARP questions for the past year and
a half, what has surfaced are very few answers and many more questions.
How dangerous is HAARP (some physicists fear severe planetary consequences)?
Commenting on HAARP in the April, 1994 issue of Physics and Society, C.
L. Herzenberg says &quot;...this technology does present issues that need
to be publicly addressed by the technical community&quot;. Can HAARP change
the ionosphere and weather patterns?? Can HAARP disrupt worldwide communications??
Can HAARP damage or destroy wildlife?? Will HAARP radiation change the
migration habits of animals that come near it?? Can HAARP cause cancer??
Can the ionospheric effects of HAARP be controlled?? Why has the project
been kept low profile and secretive, by the sponsors and the contractor
(an ARCO subsidiary)?</P>

<P>UPDATE: JUNE 1994 - ARCO sold their subsidiary to E-Systems, the 41st
largest U.S. defense contractor noted for their counter surveillance work.
Why have Alaska's public officials avoided providing serious answers to
the public's questions?? Anything that can generate these questions deserves
the MONSTER title and our serious attention.</P>

<P>Additional pieces to the puzzle that have shown themselves only serve
to heighten speculation that we are not getting clear and concise answers.
There is a connection to the recently installed Cray supercomputer at UAF
and to the Geophysical Institute there. There is an obvious power requirement
that might be met by a proposed coal power plant at Healy, connected by
a proposed power distribution intertie. Some of the experiments will require
&quot;seeding&quot; the ionosphere with chemicals that could be delivered
by rockets from the Poker Flats rocket range near Fairbanks. Patents held
by the ARCO subsidiary building HAARP describe a similar ionospheric heater
and claim abilities to stop missiles, change weather, and disrupt global
communications. The inventor, Bernard Eastlund, claims he was hired by
ARCO to find a use for their Alaska North Slope gas deposits; hence, his
inventions described in the patents. Microwave News May/June, 1994 reported
Eastlund said &quot;The HAARP project obviously looks a lot like the first
step toward this.&quot;</P>

<P>The Gakona location is interesting as it was once destined to become
an over-the-horizon radar facility. The Cold War ended before it could
be completely built. This left the military with a remote location with
buildings and generating equipment partially completed, and a choice -
either restore it to its original natural condition or find another use.
HAARP conveniently fits the site. Is the choice of this remote site for
these monster transmitters more a factor of fewer people to complain? Does
it reduce the number of humans exposed to HAARP transmissions thereby reducing
the liability? What about the wildlife in the area, what exposures will
they be subjected to? One need only remember experiments of another era
that generated nuclear fall-out killing and crippling humans and animals
in its path. It only took forty to fifty years to get the agencies involved
to admit liability.</P>

<P>In order to get an idea of just how large the HAARP transmitters are,
imagine all the ham radio operators in the United States (there are over
500,000) transmitting at their maximum allowed power from one giant antenna.
That still would not be as powerful as HAARP's multi-gigawatt (giga = billion)
radiation capability. The average Alaskan ham can communicate across the
state with less power than will be in the unintentional harmonics and side-lobes
radiated by HAARP.</P>

<P>What exactly will HAARP do? According to HAARP project documents it
will &quot;perturb&quot; the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of
energy. Using polarized, pulsating radio frequency transmissions to perform
experiments which include devising methods to destroy the communications
capabilities of others (presumably an adversary) while preserving their
own communications. Experiments with mirroring and reflecting abilities
of the ionosphere (abilities we currently depend on for all forms of communication)
will be carried out to see what military purposes may be served by the
resulting changes. An apt analogy that springs to mind is that of an inquisitive
youngster poking a sleeping bear with a stick, to see what might happen!
What will we do once the monster is unleashed?</P>

<P>The Alaska location was partially picked for its alignment with the
earth's magnetic force lines. Military experiments with the magnetosphere
also appear to be planned. And again the scientists warn of possible dire
consequences, including setting the earth into some unexpected vibration
or oscillation, similar to an axis wobble. Many scientists such as Richard
Williams writing in Physics and Society in April, 1988 have denounced this
kind of testing as irresponsible and downright dangerous, fearing long
term negative ionospheric effects. Also, like any magnet, the force lines
will react at their opposite pole, near Australia and New Zealand. Australians
are concerned enough to consider sending a team to Alaska to document and
investigate HAARP. Shouldn't Alaskans be interested too?</P>

<P>A group of NO HAARP activists is seeking to formalize their opposition
by incorporating as a non-profit organization or affiliating with an existing
group. Their prime purposes will be to promote awareness, file legal actions
and other activities focused specifically on HAARP, something no group
is currently doing. In fact, probably due to the remoteness of the Gakona
location, it has been difficult to get outsiders interested. We are quite
aware that the promoters of HAARP fully realize that they have the upper
organizational hand and the money to outlast our grassroots opposition.
Those of us in NO HAARP are committed to doing what we can to stop the
project before it comes on-line with full power in 1997. Considering the
project has been underway since the mid-1980's, this will be a difficult
task. Luckily it was not completely funded as of a year ago. There is hope
that legislative alternatives to stop it may exist as well. John Heckscher
was quoted by Microwave News in the May/June, 1994 issue saying that &quot;money
for completion of the demonstration project is in place . . . but the larger
facility would require additional funding from Congress&quot;. Unfortunately,
this additional funding is likely to be buried deep in the DOD budget.</P>

<P>What can you do? Of course you can try to &quot;write your congress
person&quot;. The Alaska delegation to congress is noted for their alignment
with the military so don't expect too much action from them. Send contributions
for the NO HAARP effort to Jim Roderick, P.O. Box 916, Homer, AK 99603.
You can lobby with the NTIA to turn down the HAARP frequency/power request.
You can make others aware of the HAARP project and the questions it raises.

<P>The OKLAHOMA BOMBING?</P>

<P>- The GODFATHER/UMF -</P>

<P>The Albert Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City collapsed into a
pile of rubble and torn bodies after explosions rippled its supports from
the foundation at approximately 9:02 am, Wednesday, April 19, 1995, the
second anniversary of the Waco massacre. Timothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran
has been arrested and charged with the crime. James and Terry Nichols,
brothers, have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to build explosive
devices at James' farm in Michigan. McVeigh and Terry Nichols were army
buddies. Casualties as of May 5th stand at 164 dead. Fifteen of them children.
Seventeen remain unidentified. The total number of injured is in excess
of 400. There are still 2 adults unaccounted for and it is feared that
they will never be found. Assistant Firechief Hansen has announced that
the clean- up of the bombsite is officially over. Rescuers wept silently
at the announcement. The reason for the bombing is still unknown. Use of
the term &quot;heartland&quot; to describe Oklahoma is right on the mark.
Oklahomans are American to the core. They are deeply religious, avid gun
owners, believe in a strict moral code, and have provided more than their
fair share of cannon fodder for the nation's wars. They are, for the most
part, honest and hard- working people from pioneer stock. Many live on
land their grandparents staked out in the great Oklahoma land rush. These
people are extremely loyal to their state and to their country. Oklahomans
knew all along where we were headed, and true to form, they tried to stop
the march toward globalism. these traits may have sealed Oklahoma's fate
on March 28, 1994 when the Oklahoma State Legislature passed a resolution
which struck out at Clinton's socialist world government agenda. They were
the first and maybe the only state to pass such legislation. *Resolution
No. 1047, 'A Resolution relating to United States military forces and the
United Nations; memorializing Congress to cease certain activities concerning
the United Nations; and directing distribution'</P>

<P>*WHEREAS, the constitutional role of the United States military is to

2ND SESSION OF THE 44TH OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:</P>

States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States Senate,
and to each member of the Oklahoma Congressional Delegation.</P>

<P>*Adopted by the House of Representatives the 28th day of March, 1994</P>

<P>The resolution passed by the Oklahoma State had the support of all the
citizens of Oklahoma. It was a slap in the face to the Clinton administration
and all those who promote the Socialist Internationale. Those murdered
at Ruby Creek and Waco cried out for justice. Americans echoed those cries.
Everyone knew that something was terribly wrong. A police state was emerging
before our eyes. Militias were forming. The Democrats suffered the worst
defeat in their history at the polls in November. The hidden agenda of
the communist/socialist Internationale was being exposed to the public
through talk radio and a thriving underground autobahn of information.
This story really began on February 26, 1993 when the World Trade Center
was bombed in New York City. William Cooper (author of 'Behold a Pale Horse')
predicted terrorists would detonate a bomb in New York City since 1989.
It is on record, on video, tape, and in his book. He predicted that it
would be blamed on Islamic fundamentalists but the real perpetrators would
be the U.S. Intelligence Community and specifically the Central Intelligence
Agency. He did not venture to guess the target. Those arrested were linked
directly to the CIA and the FBI WAS implicated in the bombing. The perpetrators
used TWO megabombs carried in a YELLOW RYDER RENTAL VAN. The bombs exploded
in the parking garage of the World Trade Center, prematurely, before being
properly placed. The result was substantial damage. Five people were killed
and over 1,000 were wounded. If the bombs had been placed in position next
to the main structural supports the result would have been exactly what
we see in Oklahoma City only much worse. Fragments of the yellow van were
QUICKLY found in the rubble. A paper trail traced the vehicle to an outlet
in New Jersey where it was rented four days before the explosion. &quot;A
lucky breakthrough&quot; led federal agents to arrest a suspect, 26 year
old Mohammed Salameh, at the Jersey City rental agency at which he attempted
to reclaim a $400 dollar deposit on the van. In a surprise revelation Tony
Lang, a staff columnist for 'The Cincinnati Enquirer' (Gannett Chain) in
Cincinnati, Ohio, has uncovered court documents to support the direct involvement
of the FBI in the World Trade Center bombing. The papers, filed in May,
disclose that a government informer, an employee of the FBI, accompanied
the accused bomber, Mohammed Salameh, to a New Jersey apartment they used
as a bomb factory...and proceeded to INSTRUCT Salameh in how to drive the
famous van two days before the explosion! In another surprise development,
reported by Louis Beam in the 'Jubilee', tapes made secretly by an FBI
informant of conversations between him and his agency handlers linked the
nation's largest law enforcement agency directly to &quot;the most destructive
terrorist act in U.S. history&quot;. Unfortunately that title now rests
with Oklahoma City. Emid Ali Salem, an FBI informant used hidden microphones
given to him by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to record his conversations
with agents of the bureau. A Los Angeles Times article on October 28, 1993
revealed to shocked readers details of FBI involvement in the terrorist
act. FBI spokesmen in Washington refuse comment. The tapes became public
knowledge when they were ordered released by a federal judge presiding
over the case of the indicted suspects. The Justice Department fought hard
to prevent their release. The tapes which have been published by the New
York Times reveal that Salem warned his FBI bosses that the World Trade
Center was soon to be bombed and urged them to prevent it. Speculation
is now rampant in political circles that certain factions within the government
may have desired the bombing in order to speed passage of new &quot;anti-crime
legislation.&quot; This suspicion was further fueled by the startling revelation
that the FBI denied Salem's request to use phoney explosives in the bomb
he was helping to build under FBI supervision - the bomb ultimately used
in the World Trade Center explosion. Former Watergate associate prosecutor
Richard Ben-Veniste warned that these tapes pose &quot;an absolute nightmare
for federal prosecutors.&quot; One high ranking law enforcement officer
who insisted on secrecy said that in less than a years time the FBI has
been linked to criminal abuse of power and the mishandling of cases in
three different instances. &quot;First we had Weaver, where an HRT member
shot a mother with a baby in her arms, then Waco, where mishandling led
to the deaths of a hundred people, and now the World Trade Center, where
it appears the bombing could not have happened unless the agency let it.&quot;
All of this comes on the heels of an Internal affairs report by the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, linking FBI agents
to everything from drug abuse to shoplifting. OPR's annual report provided
further startling proof that the agency formally most respected for it's
law enforcement skills - &quot;has gone bad.&quot; This contention is backed
up by J.B. Campbell of the 'National Educator'. If the bombs had been placed
properly, it could have toppled one tower into the other and brought them
both down along with the 50,000 people inside. The New York Times now reports
that the FBI could have thwarted the bombing by simply calling it off,
or by building the bomb with harmless powder. One of the FBI conspirators,
a former Egyptian army officer, secretly taped his meetings with his FBI
handlers. Emad Ali Salem recalls in the tape recorded meeting that the
FBI had planned on building the bomb with a phoney powder and grabbing
the people who had been trapped in the plot. But the informer, who is heard
lecturing his FBI handlers, said the powder scheme was called off and &quot;we
didn't do that.&quot; We remember the FBI crowing about its investigative
prowess after its remarkably swift nabbing of the suspects, based on debris
found in the bomb's crater. This was never true, for later we were to learn
that the FBI's informant, Emad Ali Salem, had to teach the suspects HOW
TO MAKE A PROPER BOMB. Not only did the FBI know the suspects all along,
but it GAVE THEM A BOMB. The FBI could have ordered Salem to make a harmless
bomb but, for some reason, it decided to provide a real bomb which had
the power to kill 50,000 people and to let the suspects go ahead and explode
it. My conclusion is that Cooper's prediction was 100% right on the mark.
It gets worse...The San Francisco Chronicle reported on September 25, 1993
that observers from 11 counties watched as the U.S. Department of Energy
performed what it called the largest detonation of non-nuclear explosives
ever conducted. The blast beneath the Nevada desert resulted from the ignition
of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel, which produced a force equivalent
to a one-kiloton nuclear bomb. The test was designed to allow scientists
to distinguish between nuclear and non-nuclear blasts should a permanent
worldwide ban on nuclear testing be established. Gee, all these years and
they still don't know the difference. Rumors began circulating in January
of this year that meetings were being held among federal law enforcement
agencies for the purpose of planing a move against the militia in April.
Most ignored these rumors. On February 18th Cooper spoke at a Constitution
Party rally in Ferndale, Michigan. A federal agent in the audience held
his badge and identification up to the crowd stating clearly that the federal
government had held meetings among several agencies for the purpose of
making an all out assault against patriots and the militias in April. His
statement was video taped and in on record. Cooper verified his credentials.
Such an attack would be political suicide unless some great tragedy turned
the public against the militias. It was shortly after Michigan that Cooper
obtained a copy of the 'Omnibus Counter Terrorism Act of 1995' introduced
on February 10th by Joe Biden in the Senate (S-390) and Charles Shumer
in the House (HR-896). Cooper remembers the random shooting that always
occurred before anti-gun legislation came up for a vote. He predicted a
wave of terrorism directed against the United States would begin in the
near future. He had already made this prediction in his book 'Behold a
Pale Horse' and during many lectures. It is all recorded. He knew this
would happen if all other attempts to destroy patriotism and disarm the
American people failed. He stated this in the book that all patriots would
be labeled as terrorists. A warning was contained in a memo issued by the
U.S. Marshals Service on May 15th. The memo expressed fear that &quot;the
terrorist attacks would be designed to attract worldwide press attention
to an Islamic Religious vendetta through the mass murder of innocent victims.&quot;
The warning stated that Middle Eastern terrorists were planning to launch
suicide attacks against federal facilities nationwide. Authorities reviewed
the security at Oklahoma city's Alfred P. Murrah building, nothing was
changed, and one guard was left to patrol a four building complex. Representative
James Saxton (R), a senior member of the House Task force on Terrorism,
said his group had alerted law enforcement and intelligence personnel on
February 27th that there was an increased threat of terrorism. Another
rumor flew through the grapevine. This one alleged that the federal government
would make an all out attack upon patriots and the militias on March 24th
and 25th. The rumor came from many sources and was published in 'Strategic
Investment' lending credibility to the story. ***************************
Strategic investment/March 22, 1995, behind the lines, by Jack Wheeler
- The slaughter of dozens of women and children in Waco by government stormtroopers
under the command of Field Marshall Reno may pale in comparison to what
has been planned for late March: a nationwide BATF/FBI assault on private
militias as the prelude to a possible declaration of martial law throughout
the United States. All leaves and vacations have been canceled for BATF/FBI
personnel, and for various State Police and national Guard's such as California's.
The Amry's infamous Joint Task Force Six (which did the training for Waco)
has been training BATF jackbooters with Bradley Assault Vehicles at Ft.
Bliss, Texas. Government agent provocateurs are set to plant fully automatic
and heavy weapons like rocket launchers, on the property of militia leaders.
Every militia in the country - and there are dozens, many of which are
well-armed and well-led by former or even active duty officers - is on
a state of Red Alert. Should Reno be stupid enough to actually attack them
militarily, there is going to be a lot of blood. The establishment media
is programmed to immediately thereafter thunderously bellow for nationwide
gun confiscation and even martial law. The Senate Armed Forces Committee
has been alerted and it questioning key Defense and Justice people behind
closed doors. Hopefully, Reno's Waco 2 can be stopped in time. But that
it was plotted in the first place should be a sobering lesson as to what
a horrifying extent liberalism, the political philosophy of the administration
and the Democratic Party, has been converted into a close relative of fascism.</P>

<P>Three Congressmen believed these stories to be true and wrote letters
to Janet Reno asking for an explanation. They cited federal law enforcement
sources. No answer was forthcoming. Nothing could happen unless something
were to occur that would turn the public against the militia. William Cooper
put out feelers through his people across the nation and the answer came
back the same. He could not identify any patriot or militia organization
that would do anything of the nature that would be required to justify
an all out assault upon patriots and the militia. He knew only that the
March dates were bogus. April approached. He had no hard evidence that
anything would occur, only reports from many credible sources, and fearing
that this could be an attempt to discredit the Intelligence Service, the
'Hour of the Time' and 'Veritas', he maintained silence. Ordo Ab Chao....
On Monday, April 17th the Orange County Register reported that the FBI
will open an international police training academy in Budapest. In an incredible
admission of the Socialist agenda Clinton announced that American law-enforcement
agencies are rapidly expanding over seas, deploying agents to dozens of
countries in scores of joint investigations. This followed on the heels
of the recent announcement that the FBI had opened an office in Moscow
and what used to be the KBG had opened an office in the United States.
These facts herald the formation of a nucleus for a world police/investigative
body. David Johnson of the New York Times reported, &quot;Last year, Freeh
opened an FBI office in Moscow, one of an overseas network of 24 such offices,
forward command posts for an increasingly global detective agency. He has
also been a driving force behind the Budapest training academy. Our worst
fears became reality on Wednesday morning, April 19, 1995. A bomb had gone
off at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. It became obvious within
hours that what had happened and what was being reported by the media were
two, completely different, events. The event reported be the news networks
must have taken place in China because it sure didn't happen here. The
truth is:</P>

<P>1. Witnesses reported hearing two distinct explosions, seconds apart,
then the ominous rumbling of the building falling in itself.</P>

<P>2. Survivors, who were in the building near the front wall reported
being hurled out of the front of the federal building through cinder block
walls into the street.</P>

<P>3. The front of the federal building was thrown out, away from the federal
building, and into the building across the street.</P>

<P>4. The front of the federal building was blown into the street immediately
in front and slightly to the left of center when facing what had been the
front of the federal building.</P>

<P>5. The first video tape of the disaster shows two large columns of black
smoke, one rising from the crater area in the street, and the other rising
from the center of the federal building.</P>

<P>6. Undetonated plastic explosives were found on the scene by the first
rescue workers. A rocket launcher was also found. This was reported then
later denied. Witnesses stick to their original story.</P>

<P>7. Officials reported that a second bomb had been found and police began
an immediate evacuation of the entire downtown area. Radio buffs and Intelligence
service agents monitoring scanners confirmed that radio traffic indicated
that a second bomb had been found. Explosives experts were called in along
with a bomb disposal truck. This was seen on television and those monitoring
scanners confirmed the disarming of the bomb was in progress. The following
was intercepted by 3 different people. I did not hear it and I have not
been able to obtain a copy of the tape. the speakers are unknown. Except
for minor differences all three people reported exactly the same conversation.
First voice - &quot;Boy, you're not going to believe this!&quot; Second
voice - &quot;Believe what?&quot; First voice - &quot;I can't believe it
... this is a military bomb!&quot; After several hours the bomb disposal
truck left and the report of a second bomb was denied.</P>

<P>8. Two people identifying themselves as firemen, but refusing to give
their names, reported that the second bomb was in fact several bombs, olive
drab colored cans of fulminate of mercury, clearly labeled as such, with
MilSpec numbers, which were found intact on separate floors next to the
elevator shaft. Officials denied these allegations. The following day an
elderly gentleman who identified himself as the father of one of the firemen
called to confirm that his son had reported the same findings to him. He
refused to give his name.</P>

<P>9. Initial examination of the bomb scene revealed that a minimum of
two bombs were needed to inflict the damage that presented. The steel reinforced
concrete pillars that held up the building were sheered off at ground level
clear back to the third pillar throughout the building. Explosives experts
have confirmed that this is impossible with the one bomb scenario being
presented by the government and the media. The reports of the survivors
who were blown out of the front of the building into the street and the
front of the building blown outward across the street support their findings.
A retired General who had spent over 25 years in explosives research and
ultimately commanded the explosives research facility for a branch of the
military informed us that the pillars could only be taken down at ground
level by satchel charges or shaped charges placed upon each pillar. His
mathematics are impressive. I do not have the expertise to understand what
he is talking about, but with his credentials someone had better listen.</P>

<P>After the brief and painful accusations against the Islamic community
and the arrest of several people of mid-eastern descent, including one
traveler at London's Heathrow Airport, the accusations swung right around
as Cooper predicted to patriots and militias. The most incredible hate
campaign in the history of the world was directed toward Islamics, Christians,
whites, males, patriots, militias, anyone using diesel fuel, anyone using
fertilizer, anyone from the state of Michigan, all who support the constitution
for the United States of America, and the people who live in Arizona, especially
talk radio hosts. The standard Ryder truck rental reared its ugly head
and within hours the FBI not only had enough parts to identify the type
of truck but had already traced it back to the rental agency. (Incredible)
The FBI quickly produced what appeared to be drawings of near photograph
quality of two suspects. Later, after McVeigh was captured, the FBI released
a new drawing of John Doe #2 which looked more like a drawing. The man
who is accused of bombing the federal building was caught speeding in a
car, his own, without license plates. He was arrested, without resistance,
for carrying a concealed weapon and jailed. (How convenient) A CBS feed
on the KU satellite band reported that the Initial report that the concealed
weapon was a gun was in error. The commentator (a woman) reported that
the concealed weapon for which McVeigh was jailed was a knife. This report
was never aired to our knowledge. The FBI and the media reported that McVeigh
lived in Kingman, Arizona at Canyon West Trailer Park. He was described
as having lived in trailer #19, under the name of his girlfriend. They
reported that he was evicted after a stormy nine months in which the man
played loud music, left piles of beer cans and a wrecked car by the trailer
and belligerently refused to obey camp rules. When interested people actually
contacted these same people they stated that McVeigh had lived in trailer
#11 from June 1993 until early September 1993. They described Tim McVeigh
as a nice man, quiet and neat. &quot;He was a nice guy, a model tenant.&quot;
The pawn shop owner, William Stumpp, killed in Texarkana by Richard Wayne
Snell was not a Jew and the press knew this all the time they reported
that he was a Jew. Stumpp was an Episcopalian not Jewish. Alacia Adams
Esquivios has signed an affidavit stating that she saw John Doe #2 on April
19th in a white government van traveling south on highway 44 at 5:15 pm.
She called the FBI on the morning of the 21st and reported what she saw.
She was told an agent would contact her for an interview. No one showed.
She called again on Monday the 24th. The person who answered the phone
said an agent would come out and interview her. She is still waiting. Members
of the St. Lucie-based second regiment of the Florida State Militia report
that Timothy McVeigh attended a local militia rally last year as a bodyguard
for Mark Koernke. Koernke denies any knowledge of McVeigh. The seismograph
report from Oklahoma University, according to Dr. Luza of the University
of Oklahoma-Norman, shows two unmistakable &quot;events&quot; that happened
in the Oklahoma City area, the first at 9:02 am followed by a second 10
seconds later. Both are surface events similar in signature to a quarry
blast, both of approximately the same duration and magnitude. no other
disturbance occurred the morning of the 19th of April in the Oklahoma City
area. The seismograph confirms witness reports of two explosions. In an
interview Dr. Luza said the second event could not have been an echo or
bounce back because the seismograph would have shown a distinctly separate
pattern if it had been either of those two things, and geologists are easily
able to recognize the secondary pattern when such an echo or bounceback
occurs. When asked if the second event could have been caused by the crashing
of the building as it collapsed, Dr. Luza said no, and explained that had
the seismograph recorded the collapse of the building, the second markings
would have been of a much lesser magnitude, and it did not take the building
ten seconds after the explosion to begin to collapse. In his closing remarks,
Dr. Luza stated that the two events were of identical magnitude, as if
the same bomb had gone off twice, and that if the second event had been
caused by an echo or anything else, the seismographic record would not
have shown such perfect consistency between the two events. His conclusion
was that there were definitely two separate explosions in the Oklahoma
city area separated by only 10 seconds. The official interpretation of
the seismograph record from the Oklahoma Geological Survey Seismograph
Station in Norman, Oklahoma is that they recorded a large surface-wave
&quot;train&quot; at 9:02:13 a.m. (140213 UTC) shortly after the explosion
at the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The seismometer
is located approximately four miles north of Norman and sixteen miles from
downtown Oklahoma City. A second large surface-wave was recorded at 9:02:23
a.m. (140223 UTC). The location and source of the second surface-wave recording
is unknown. The record is read from top to bottom and from left to right.
The small vertical offsets of the horizontal lines are minute marks. Hour
marks are twice as long as the minute marks. I've seen a second seismographic
reading from the Oklahoma City Omniplex. The station is very close to the
federal building and the seismograph reflects the fact. The two explosions
are registered on this graph as blank spaces where the needle literally
jumped off the sheet. The events are separated by 10 seconds of ink. No
experts exist at the Omniplex station. The employee who gave me a copy
said it was miraculous that the Omniplex had any records at all because
the seismograph had not been working up until 40 minutes prior to the explosions.
The Omniplex is located at the Kirkpatrick Center, at 50th and Martin Luther
King Blvd. The FBI seized the original seismographic record. My copy is
a copy made before the seizure by an employee One of the federal agents
who died in the blast was the former head of President Clinton's Secret
Service team of bodyguards. How many does that make? Oklahoma Governor
Frank Keating is an ex-FBI agent. Anti-terrorism bill is now on the fast
track. In a &quot;Bullet Poll&quot; conducted by KTBS-TV Channel 3, Shreveport,
Louisiana and reported on April 20th the following question was asked ...
&quot;Would you be willing to give up some of your freedom for a little
security?&quot; 74% reportedly fell into the category bracketed by &quot;some-most-all&quot;.
On April 28th the tape of James Nichols hearing was released by court order
and it was blank. Nothing whatsoever could be heard on the tape. It was
the only record of the proceedings. Office workers state that almost all
of the FBI and BATF agents and an unbelievable number of supervisory personnel
did not arrive at work at their usual time on Wednesday, April 19, 1995
and were not in the building when the bomb went off. A card was sent to
the hospital for the survivors by a third grade boy. It reads: &quot;Hello,
I hope you feel better from the explosion in Oklahoma. I wish it never
had happened. I felt bad for the people who died and the people who got
hurt. That's only the beginning of what's going to happen to America. Hope
you feel better, Jonathan Roden&quot;</P>

<P>Dope, Incorporated</P>

<P>Extracted from Dope, Inc.-The Book That Drove Henry Kissinger Crazy</P>

<P>supplied by The P/\NTHER</P>

<P>Seventeen years ago, the first edition of Dope, Inc. was released. Commissioned
by anti-drug American statesman Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr, it was the first
book to reveal that the illegal drug cartel was becoming the world's biggest
business; to name the causes of the war 'Dope, Inc.' has waged against
every nation in the world; and to reveal the names of the 'untouchable'
figures who protect it, including the European monarchs, whom our Hollywood
media have sold to the public as veritable deities.</P>

<P>Even before the first copies of the first edition of Dope, Inc.-Britain's
Opium War Against the United States, rolled off the press in December 1978,
leaders of the narcotics enterprise were busy trying to stop LaRouche.
Beginning in summer 1978, the Anti Defamation League (ADL) launched a multimillion-dollar
campaign to label LaRouche and his political associates as &quot;anti-Semites&quot;
for daring to expose the involvement of gangsters like Merey Lansky and
Zionist lobby leaders like Edgar Bronfman and Max Fisher in the dope business.
LaRouche also identified the powerful British Crown bankers as partners
in the dope trade, along with the Jewish crime syndicate.</P>

<P>The ADL's 'anti-Semitic' smear against LaRouche was pure 'big lie' terrorism
in the tradition of Nazi propagandist Joesph Goebbels. Everyone who bothered
to look into the matter knew that LaRouche's political career had been
built around his discoveries in physical economy, and that by 1978 he had
written hundreds of articles and several books exposing the fascist economic
austerity policies behind the Nazi holocaust which killed millions of Jews
and other victims. The ADL's bizarre slanders prompted EIR's investigators
to scrutinize the history of the supposed 'Jewish civil rights' organization.</P>

<P>The probe turned up a 70-year legacy of intimate ADL ties with Jewish
gangsters, from Meyer Lansky and his 'Our Crowd' sponsor Arnold Rothstein,
to more contemporary Dope, Inc. figures such as Max Fisher, Edgar Bronfman,
Edmond Safra, Meshulam Riklis, the ADL's own national chairman, Kenneth
Bialkin, and the lawyer for the Medellin Cartel's 'American connection',
Robert Vesco. We also discovered that much of the ADL's financial backing
comes from leading families of the Anglo-American establishment, whose
fortunes trace back to the British banks and trading companies that ran
the opium clipper ships in and out of China in the last century.</P>

<P>To this day, the ADL holds the key to the corruption of the American
political and judicial system, a corruption that was bought and paid for
by the proceeds of the international dope trade. Lyndon LaRouche was railroaded
to prison on a train built by drug money and stoked by government officials
and private agencies on the pad of Dope, Inc.</P>

<P>By the summer of 1982, the ADL was joined in its 'Get LaRouche' efforts
by Henry A. Kissinger, former Secretary of State and recipient of the ADL's
Man of the Year award. Kissinger launched a vendetta to get the federal
government to shut down the LaRouche movement.</P>

<P>The case of LaRouche associate, Lewis du Pont Smitch, illustrates the
desperation of the efforts by Kissinger and the 'Get LaRouche' task force
to stop the LaRouche movement's organizing of a national war on drugs.
An heir to the du Pont family industrial fortune, Smitch contributed US$212,000
to the LaRouche movement in 1985, the bulk of it for the publication of
the second edition of this book. Within months, Smith's parents-advised
by none other than Kissinger-had secured a judgment in the Chester Country,
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, depriving their son of control of his
inheritance and suspending his basic human rights-such as the right to
sign contracts and be married-on the grounds that Smith was &quot;mentally
incompetent&quot;. Smith's is the first case in American history in which
an individual has been declared incompetent by the courts on the basis
of political affiliation.</P>

<P>Kissinger: A British Agent of Influence</P>

<P>Although Kissinger has been historically a close ally of the most rabid
factions inside Israel and within the Zionist establishment in the United
States, his primary allegiance throughout his political career has been
to the British Crown and its intelligence and financial tentacles.</P>

<P>On 10 May 1982, addressing a celebration at the Royal Institute for
International Affairs at Chatham House in London, Kissinger boasted that
throughout his career in the Nixon and Ford administrations, he had always
been closer to the British Foreign Office than to his American colleagues,
and had taken all his major policy leads from London. Kissinger set up
the international 'consulting firm' Kissinger Associates, in partnership
with Britain's Peter Lord Carrington, shortly after he delivered that Chatham
House lecture.</P>

<P>Chatham House is a successor to the old British East India Company,
and serves as the think-tank and foreign intelligence arm of the British
Crown. The roots of Chatham House are to be found in Britain's nineteenth-century
Opium War policy.</P>

<P>Kissinger is no stranger to the world of international dope trafficking.
The 1978 edition of Dope, Inc. told how Kissinger played a pivotal role
in covering up the involvement of the People's Republic of China in the
South East Asian Golden Triangle heroin trade in the early 1970s when he
was shuttling between Washington and Beijing playing the 'China card'.
Tens of thousands of American GIs who became addicted to drugs in South
East Asia during the Vietnam War should hold Kissinger at least partially
responsible for their habits. Later, during the 1980s, through Kissinger
Associates, Henry became a business partner of some of the same Chinese
opium lords he protected from American drug enforcement for over a decade.</P>

<P>Kissinger was furious that LaRouche and his associates widely circulated
the official text of his Chatham House speech to document that Kissinger
was a loyal asset of the British Crown. He went head-to-head with LaRouche
over Reagan administration policy. By 1982, a major battle had broken out
within the administration over the emerging Ibero-American debt crisis,
a crisis of which LaRouche had been warning senior White House officials
for months. A confrontation evolved between LaRouch and Kissinger over
whether Washington would negotiate an equitable solution to the debt crisis,
on a government-to-government basis, or back International Monetary Fund
policies aimed at further looting our hemispheric neighbors.</P>

<P>Kissinger's own efforts, aided by the ADL's so-called Civil Rights Division,
were augmented in January 1983 by a Kissinger solicited intervention on
the part of several members of President Ronald Reagan's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board, led by Edward Bettett Williams, David Abshire and Leo Cherne.
The PFIAB members demanded that the FBI launch an international investigation
of Lyndon LaRouche, in effect claiming that LaRouche's expose of Kissinger's
record of selling out the United States to British, Soviet and Dope, Inc.
interests was somehow &quot;subversive&quot;.</P>

<P>Government documents catalog the role of Kissinger's PFIAB cronies.
A memorandum from Webster to his chief deputy, Oliver Revell, dated 12
January 1983, stated in part: &quot;At the PFIAB meeting today, [name reacted]
raised the subject of the activities of the US Labor Party and Lyndon LaRouche.
He noted that he and a number of other Americans in public life had been
the subject of repeated harassment by LaRouche and wondered whether the
FBI had a basis for investigating these activities under the guidelines
or otherwise. A number of members present, including Edward Bennett Williams,
raised the question of the sources for these US Labor Party activities.
In view of the large amounts obviously being expended worldwide, the question
was raised whether the US Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence
agencies.&quot; (Emphasis added.)</P>

<P>The PFIAB inquiry led in early 1983 to the opening of a formal FBI investigation
into Lyndon LaRouche and his associates. That inquiry provided the legal
cover for an all-out offensive to drive LaRouche and his associates out
of business and into prison. The &quot;guidelines&quot; under which the
unconstitutional 'Get LaRouche' campaign was conducted, were contained
in a little-known White House document, Executive Order 12333, signed by
President Reagan in December 1981. EO 12333 gave the FBI and US intelligence
agencies a broad mandate to spy on and conduct covert actions against American
citizens deemed to be opponents of the incumbent administration. EO 12333
also allowed these agencies to use private citizens as their agents in
carrying out these operations. At this point, the ADL became an integral
component of the government's 'Get LaRouche' task force.</P>

<P>The ADL and Kissinger found their most willing collaborators inside
the Reagan-Bush administration among the spooks and White House staffers
involved in the illegal, secret Iran-Contra program. Once again, the pawprints
of Dope, Inc. were everywhere.</P>

<P>LaRouche Objects to Contra Policy</P>

<P>In the first years of the Reagan administration, LaRouche had collaborated
with several senior administration officials in the development of the
Strategic Defense Initiative and other national security policies. During
the 1982-83 period, LaRouche and his colleagues had been quietly approached
and asked to also cooperate with the administration's effort to support
the Contra guerrillas fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
LaRouche warned the Reagan administration that the Contras were a wholly
owned asset of international gun and drug trafficking organizations and
that the entire anti-Sandinista program-and the Reagan administration's
widely publicized anti-drug efforts along with it-were doomed to disaster
if the administration went ahead with its Contra support program. As an
alternative plan of action, LaRouche proposed that the administration focus
its Central American efforts on an all out war on drugs which would, among
other things, expose Soviet, Cuban and Sandinista involvement in the dope
trade.</P>

<P>By this time, with pressure from Wall Street and the Zionist lobby,
Henry Kissinger had been named to head up the Reagan administration's Blue
Ribbon Commission on Central American Policy. A one-time paid employee
of the ADL, Carl Gershman, had been named as the chief of the administration's
National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a covert operations funding agency
housed in the State Department's US Information Agency. The NED was at
the center of the secret support for the Contras. For Kissinger and the
ADL-led NED, dealing with cocaine traffickers was no problem. But LaRouche's
public expose of leading drug traffickers on the government payroll was
a problem.</P>

<P>A May 1986 memo from White House Iran-Contra operator Gen. Richard Secord
to National Security Council staffer Oliver North confirms that the Contra
support apparatus-what Sen. David Boren (D-Oklahoma) labelled the &quot;secret,
parallel government&quot;-was gathering &quot;information against LaRouche&quot;.</P>

<P>By the spring of 1986, following dramatic electoral victories in the
statewide Illinois Democratic Party primary by two LaRouche backed candidates
for lieutenant governor and secretary of state, the &quot;Get LaRouche&quot;
forces inside the government had built up momentum, especially inside the
deeply corrupted Department of Justice and the FBI.</P>

<P>Two of the most zealous of the Justice Department 'Get LaRouche' activists
were William Weld and Arnold Burns. Weld was the US attorney in Boston
who led the federal government's pioneering strike-force against LaRouche.
He became head of the Department of Justice Criminal Division in September
1986, the number-two position at the DOJ. Now Governor of Massachusetts,
Weld is the scion of a prominent blue-blood family that made its fortune
in the China opium trade.</P>

<P>Arnold Burns, the Deputy Attorney General, was a director of the ADL's
Sterling National Bank, an outfit founded by mob cronies of Meyer Lansky
and implicated in hot-money dealings in the United States, Italy and Israel.
Burns himself was nearly indicted in a money-laundering scheme run by Israel's
secret service, the Mossad. It would later emerge that Burns' partners
in that scheme were part of the Jonathan Jay Pollard Israeli-Soviet espionage
ring.</P>

<P>In October 1986, an army of over 400 federal and state police, accompanied
by helicopters, fixed-wing planes and an armored personnel carrier, conducted
a raid against the offices of several LaRouche-associated publications
in Leesburg, Virginia. This was the largest domestic paramilitary action
by the federal government since the urban and student riots of the late
1960s and early 1970s. The purpose was simply to execute two search warrants
and make four arrests of people who had no criminal records!</P>

<P>Over the next several years, LaRouche and dozens of associates were
arrested and put on trial. A prosecution of LaRouche and a dozen co-defendants
in a Boston federal court ended in a mistrial on 4 May 1988. The Boston
jury had heard 92 days of testimony from government witnesses. The defense
never got to present its case. However, the jurors, according to press
accounts, were so angry at the government's behavior that when they polled
themselves after they had been dismissed by the judge, they voted LaRouche
and the others &quot;not guilty&quot; on all 125 counts. One juror told
the Boston Herald on 5 May 1988 that he and his colleagues were convinced
the government had committed crimes against LaRouche. LaRouche told the
press that he had been defrauded of a verdict of &quot;innocent&quot;.</P>

<P>Six months later, the Justice Department re-indicted LaRouche in an
Alexandria, Virginia federal district court on nearly identical charges.
The judge and they jury were rigged. The jury foreman, a Department of
Agriculture official named Buster HOrton, had been a member of a secret
government task force that also included Oliver North. The judge, Albert
V. Bryan, Jr. had been a business partner of the CIA's biggest secret arms
dealer, Sam Cummings. In that federal trial and at subsequent state trials
in Virginia, leading officials of the ADL operated as de facto members
of the government's prosecution team. In one telling incident, the ADL
was caught attempting to bribe a Commonwealth of Virginia trial judge with
a promise of a state Supreme Court post in return for throwing the book
at the LaRouche defendants.</P>

<P>On 27 January 1989, just days after George Bush was inaugurated as President,
LaRouche was deprived of bail, pending appeal, and thrown in federal prison,
along with six colleagues. LaRouche was sentenced to 15 years in prison-a
life sentence for a man already in his mid-60's. Bush added his imprimatur
to the jailing by refusing to release thousands of pages of exculpatory
evidence under the control of the White House. Of all his political adversaries
and critics, Lyndon LaRouche was the one man whom George Bush desperately
wanted out of the way.</P>

<P>But the jailing of LaRouche and some of his closest colleagues was not
enough to satisfy the Dope, Inc. crowd. Two LaRouche-linked publications,
New Solidarity, a twice-weekly newspaper with over 100,000 subscribers,
and Fusion a science magazine with over 114,000 subscribers were seized
by the government on 21 April 1987 and shut down in an action that federal
courts after the fact declared to have been illegal. Federal Bankruptcy
Court Judge Martin V. B. Bostetter wrote in his 25 October 1989 decision,
which was upheld on appeal, that the government action had been in &quot;bad
faith&quot; and that the government had committed a &quot;constructive
fraud upon the court&quot;.</P>

<P>When Lyndon LaRouche first warned senior Reagan administration officials
about the drug cartel links of the Nicaraguan Contras, it was not yet publicly
known that the US government was selling dope to American children to fund
the secret Contra war in Nicaragua (even at the same time that some well-meaning
government officials thought they were genuinely fighting drugs).</P>

<P>Within days of the Leesburg raid, the first details of the Iran Contra
scandal surfaced following the crash of an American supply plane over Nicaraguan
territory and the arrest of Eugene Hasenfus, a member of the crew. In the
months following the Hasenfus capture, more and more pieces of the secret
government corruption came out.</P>

<P>The case of Lt. Col. Oliver North is one good example of this corruption,
especially because so much media attention has been directed toward building
up the image of the Marine-turned-White House superspy as a model of American
patriotism.</P>

<P>Evidence made public during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings,
through federal and state court cases and international criminal prosecutions,
reveals that Oliver North was in the middle of a major international arms-for-drugs
trafficking operations which was run out of his National Security Council
office at the Old Executive Office building next door to the White House.</P>

<P>Colonel North was the day-to-day operations officer for the Contra resupply
program. But it was Vice-President George Bush, the former CIA Director,
who was formally in charge of the entire Reagan administration Central
America covert operations program. Under National Security Decision Directive
3, signed by Ronald Reagan in May 1982, Bush was placed in charge of two
little-known White House secret committees: the Special Situation Group
(SSG) and the Crisis Pre-Planning Group (CPPG). Oliver NOrth was the secretary
of the CPPG, and it was in this capacity that he ran the Central America
spook show under George Bush.</P>

<P>North's personal notebooks, which cataloged most of his meetings, telephone
calls and personal observations during his White House days, betray the
fact that he was well aware that the Contras were being heavily financed
by Miami-based cocaine traffickers. For example, a 26 March 1985 handwritten
entry in North's notebook read: &quot;Rafael Quintero-Secord's Agent should
be on shore when arrivals occur-as liaison w/ APLICANO...Quintero...&quot;
Several days later, on 3 April, a sequel note reads: &quot;0600-RAFAEL
QUINTERO-(captured)-known narcotics trafficker-Enrique Camarena..&quot;.</P>

<P>Camarena was a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in Guadalajara,
Mexico, who was kidnapped and tortured to death in February 1985. In 1990,
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a Honduran national who helped set up Colombian
cocaine routes through Mexico, was convicted along with several other men
in federal court in Los Angeles of conspiracy to kidnap and murder Camarena.</P>

<P>BEYOND THE MOON surpressed NASA findings by Fred Steckling supplied
by The P/\NTHER/UMF </P>

<P>This article does not deal with the Moon directly, but ventures farther
out into our solar system. Today, despite our Mariner and Viking missions
to Venus and Mars, the mystery about our neighbor planets has only widened
and most questions still remain unexplained. The most pressing question
of all is, does life exist on these worlds? Many scientists have voiced
their opinion that unless we send manned spacecraft concerning life on
these worlds may never satisfactorily be explained. The late Werner Von
Braun, rocket specialist for NASA, once stated that manned space flights
are by far more efficient than the remote controlled devices. Man, after
all, is performing his tasks in space more efficiently than any computer
ever could. &quot;Besides&quot;, Braun remarked, &quot;Man can be mass
produced by unskilled labor.&quot;</P>

<P>The mysteries mount because already from the early analysis of the United
States Mariner and the Soviet Venera missions to Venus, many contradictory
findings were reported. Since these mysteries cannot be explored by telescopes
as the planets are too far away, we must rely totally on data radioed back
to Earth by the satellites. Over the centuries our Moon, for instance,
has been the target for endless hours of telescopic observations. These
observations have revealed to us that at least some unexplainable things
are happening up there. The problem is, however, that even now after our
Apollo landings, these mysteries still remain. This indicates that we know
what is going on, to some extent, but hesitate to talk about it.</P>

<P>Receiving correct information from our space probes on Venus and Mars
makes it easier to conceal information, if we wish to do so. Therefore,
it is for the officials to determine whether to release this truth, or
untruth, over which they retain complete control. If we would live in a
truthful world, it would be easy to accept all that we are told. But most
of us know better. Suspecting the very real possibility of &quot;the great
cosmic cover-up&quot; as some authors have termed it, the public needs
to maintain a constant vigil on the officials and the validity of their
releases. Much &quot;between the lines&quot; reading is required as well
as an unrelenting search for contradictory statements to the press and
public, in order to seize the 'wool' before it is pulled too far over the
eyes of the public.</P>

<P>We live in a privileged country and our constitutional rights permit
us to question the officials, as well as our leaders. In our country where
the government is of the people, by the people, and for the people, this
relationship must be maintained under all circumstances, in order that
our freedom may be preserved.</P>

<P>Freedom alone, contrary to the belief of many, is not just the right
for anyone to do as he pleases, but it also entails the duty to seek and
maintain the truth about things of a political, economic, and religious
nature. No doubt the technical feat of steering a remote-controlled spacecraft
to the endless voids of space and locating its target with such accuracy
is a great engineering undertaking. Intricate mathematical and ballistic
problems must be solved in order to succeed in these missions. We know
they arrived there, but is the data they send back bonafide?</P>

<P>The signals received here on Earth by our tracking stations were send
in a code, deciphered only by the very top scientists through sophisticated
decoding equipment. The point I am trying to make is simple. While these
beeps, dots, and dashes are witnessed by literally hundreds of scientists,
how many of them really know what this jargon means before it is decoded?
It is obvious that only a few do and we have to trust them. I recall discrepancies
which arose when the United States Mariner spacecraft and the Soviet Venera
spacecraft radioed back to Earth temperature differences from Venus, ranging
up to 400 degrees fahrenheit. Naturally both nations claimed technical
superiority, insisting that their instruments were of superior design.
Because of this conflict, secret meetings in Europe by the space experts
from the United States and the USSR were held in order to coordinate their
releases, as such confusion causes the public to become dissatisfied, wondering,
skeptical and restless.</P>

<P>The soft landing devices on Venus caused much more controversy than
anticipated. We were told that Venus is the Earth's sister planet, very
much the same size as Earth, but that its atmospheric density is over one
hundred times as dense as that of Earth, and is laden with sulfuric acid.
People would have accepted that. However, when the officials stated that
these spacecraft landed on Venus by parachute, that stretched the imagination.
The explanation is simple. It is impossible to parachute an object of this
size, weight, and density to the surface of Venus through an atmosphere
one hundred times as dense as Earth. That is like attempting to parachute
this same device 2,000 feet down to the bottom of our sea, with pressures
identical to those of the Venusian atmosphere. Even scientists at NASA
confirmed this fact, indirectly, not with the planet Venus, but with Titan,
Saturn's moon. The NASA press release of December 12, 1980, stated that
Titan had a 300-mile thick atmosphere, hence its surface cannot be seen.
The conditions there seem to be identical to those on Venus. If future
spacecraft entitled the Cronos probe were to be send to Titan to land by
parachute, NASA space expert, James Murphy, indicated the parachute would
not work, because the atmosphere of Titan is too dense.</P>

<P>If the atmosphere of Venus is really over one hundred times as dense
as ours, a landing device would float to its surface by itself, like a
pearl down into the bottom of a shampoo bottle. This would make a parachute
landing unnecessary. Furthermore, a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit
produces violent thermals. I doubt seriously that even if the Venusian
atmosphere were identical to ours that it would be a simple matter to land
a parachute there, because of thermal activity.</P>

<P>When the USSR landed one of its Venera spacecraft on the surface of
Venus, it transmitted some excellent photographs, depicting a bright landscape
of hills and rocks, much like our deserts on Earth. This caused even greater
surprise, because an atmosphere that dense should produce total darkness
on the surface of Venus. how they managed to photograph this well lit landscape,
emitting an abundance of sunlight, has been a continuing mystery.</P>

<P>This posed other questions, such as the reports of mapping the surface
of Venus by radar. If this would be possible, then we should be able to
map our own ocean floors by radar. However, this is not possible because
on earth the water reflects the radar beams and so do water vapor clouds,
which have also been detected on Venus. One would assume that with the
density and consistency of water, we should instead attempt to use sonar
to map the surface of Venus. From the charts recently released, the radar
techniques seems to work well, which raises doubts that the Venusian atmosphere
is really as dense as we are being told.</P>

<P>Just recently released findings by the USSR, which is exhibiting much
interest in Venus, revealed the discovery of electromagnetic discharges
in the form of lighting flashes on that planet. Their spacecraft, Venera
11, also recorded a forceful storm ninety miles wide, with lighting discharges
at the rate of twenty-five per second. United States scientists said that
this was rather remarkable, because nobody expected to find lightning on
Venus. Naturally, they are surprised because an atmosphere over one hundred
times as dense as ours, laden with sulfuric acid, would be self-grounding,
making lighting highly improbable. Does this mean now that we are fed untrue
information deliberately? Or does this mean that the officials are trying
to tell us something, very much like they did with the Moon? Not outright
revelations, but here and there, a bit of contradiction to make us think.</P>

<P>There are more surprises to be found on Venus, and one of them is its
cloud formations, which totally envelop the planet. Rotation of Venus was
determined by radar, as well as by other means, to be every 280 days, once
around its axis. Let us hope that this was correctly performed. Photographs
of the Venusian cloud patterns, and the behavior of their weather, at least
in the upper atmosphere, is quite familiar to us, because it looks very
much like our own. The cloud patterns move away from the equator area toward
the northern and southern hemisphere in clockwise and counterclockwise
fashion, and it takes them about four days to go around the planet once.
One begins to wonder why these clouds behave just like those on Earth,
which also take about the same time to move around the Earth. In other
words, what makes the clouds move?</P>

<P>The contradictions continue, one being the importance of having all
United States landing spacecraft on Venus thoroughly sterilized. This brings
up the question of the necessity of sterilization in an 800 degree fahrenheit
atmosphere, which is four times as hot as boiling water. It is true that
certain bacteria can survive, and even reproduce under many hostile conditions,
like the cooling water surrounding nuclear reactors, in tanks of jet aircraft,
or in jars of gasoline, as one scientist in Los Angeles demonstrated to
me.. Even below, deep in our oceans around hot volcanic geysers, certain
strains of bacteria survive, as well as algae. I am certain that common
bacteria, such as we are exposed to on the surface of the Earth daily,
would not enjoy longevity on Venus, should it be as hot there as we have
been informed.</P>

<P>Speaking of contamination of other planets, it has been found that micro-organisms
have been traced, even to the far reaches of space, which probably were
deposited there by the trail of Earth's atmosphere, or perhaps even other
planets. Since these organisms seem to survive in hibernation almost indefinitely,
they may in time become part of another atmosphere in another planet, attracted
by its gravity, and gently flow toward its surface and multiply. If this
is true, then indeed we live in a chemical universe, where one planet &quot;pollutes&quot;
another with seeds of life. This no doubt is an interesting thought, worthwhile
to consider in our quest of Nature's secrets in outer space and other worlds.</P>

<P>We have high temperatures in the Earth's ionosphere. About 180 miles
up, where the cosmic solar rays strike the outer region of our atmosphere,
a tremendous friction is generated from he disintegration of atmospheric
molecules. Temperatures of up to 1800 degrees fahrenheit have been measured
there. Could it be that the high temperature readings of the planet Venus
found their origin in the Venusian ionosphere as our spacecraft descended
through it? This is certainly something to consider.</P>

<P>Another interesting explanation concerning temperatures is that the
sun is positive and the planets are negative, and all are floating in a
sea of electromagnetic energy. Solar rays are attracted by each planetary
body differently in intensity and velocity, according to the size of the
planet. If this is correct, it would explain why the temperatures in outer
space are 360 degrees below zero, no matter whether it is in space, around
Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, or even farther out. It would also explain
why the larger planets such as Jupiter and Saturn reflect more heat. If
the Sun sends out heat, then why is it 360 degrees below zero in outer
space? The gravity of Jupiter and Saturn is much higher than Earth's gravity.
In this case, should my ideas be correct, these larger planets would attract
the solar rays with a much higher velocity and intensity than Venus and
the Earth and even the Moon. In fact, cosmic ray bombardment on the Moon
should be one-sixth in intensity in this case.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the friction generated on Jupiter and Saturn when
these rays strike their atmosphere, causes these planets to receive heat
and warmth. This explains from whence their heat is generated.</P>

<P>According to present theories, any planet farther out than Mars is an
ice world or frozen rock. This theory was shaken when our recent Voyager
spacecraft discovered volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io. In fact,
Jupiter and Saturn have been compared to individual solar systems, with
many of their satellites, of which more and more are discovered each day,
producing nothing but mysteries for us. Granted that my idea does not prove
that it is correct, but at least I offer some explanation regarding a multitude
of unexplained questions.</P>

<P>On the other hand, our old accepted theories certainly have not produced
any satisfactory explanations either. In other words, their ideas are neither
better nor worse than mine.</P>

<P>The next planet I would like to mention is Mars. When the United States
succeeded in the successful landing of the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft in
1976, there was great rejoicing among the people of the Earth. This was
an achievement well worthy of the celebration. After the excitement abated
somewhat, certain nagging questions surfaced concerning some of the reports
released to the public regarding the planet Mars. I covered these events
thoroughly and in 1976, in late Autumn, I was compelled to write and article
for a national magazine, entitled &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. This article
was also later reprinted in Europe and Japan. I herewith reproduce it,
with only minor changes.</P>

<P>&quot;For centuries man, on this earth, has wondered whether or not
'life' existed elsewhere on the distant planets that could be seen passing
through the heavens at night. Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, together
with Venus, our second closest neighbor, would be the most logical places
to assume that there is life close to what we know it to be.</P>

<P>&quot;It probably all started with the Italian astronomer, Giovanni
Schiaparelli, who in 1877, reported the famous 'Canali' or canals on Mars.
Only intelligent beings could have built such structures, it was suggested.</P>

<P>&quot;Later, at the turn of the century, Percival Lowell, who, from
his observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 1906, became the ranking expert
on Mars' observations. He, too, reported and supported Schiaparelli's 'Canali'.</P>

<P>&quot;Still later, the world renowned newscaster and actor Orson Wells
succeeded in frightening millions of Americans with his famous radio broadcast
of 1938, War of the World, portraying it as a real life invasion by beings
from Mars landing in New Jersey.</P>

<P>&quot;Decades later, during the 1960's, Soviet astronomers announced
to an astonished scientific world that their close studies of the planet
Mars had revealed that both moons of the Red Planet were thought to be
artificial man-made satellites. Their observations, based on several very
puzzling facts, led to this conclusion. Both of the Martians 'moons' were
orbiting too close to the planet, only 3700 miles away. Normally they should
crash into the planet in time. Also both moons reflected too much light
to be natural. Probably the most puzzling fact of all was that both are
orbiting the planet in a clockwise direction. All other known planetary
bodies and satellites whirl in a counterclockwise direction&gt; Even the
entire Milky Way galaxy with its countless number of stars turns counterclockwise,
but not the two little moons of Mars. Granted, the idea of two orbiting
bodies, one five miles in diameter and the other ten miles being artificial,
is a bit controversial and stretches the imagination.</P>

<P>&quot;November 16, 1969, a noted space scientist and astronomer, the
late Dr. Harold C. Urey, stated some things just as startling as his Soviet
colleagues. Dr. Urey, speaking at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston,
Texas, said, &quot;We should be very careful in sending manned spacecraft
to the planet Mars as the 'life' there may be hostile and could prevent
the astronauts from returning to earth.&quot; Dr. Urey was a Nobel prize
winner in chemistry. In the same article he also defended the space program,
stating that we can afford it, for it costs only one-half of one percent
of the gross national product.</P>

<P>&quot;Turning the pages to 1976 and our recent Viking Missions to the
Red Planet, it seems that we have certainly proven all these men wrong,
or have we? It may surprise some of you, but after endless hours of study
and investigation into our two missions to Mars, I must say NO, we have
NOT proven these men wrong at all. In the following pages I shall endeavor
to explain my findings for your own evaluation in the most logical way
possible.</P>

<P>&quot;The reaction of the general public can be broken down as follows:
40% were disappointed in the total negative viewpoint of the Viking mission,
and 50% definitely believe that intelligent life does exist on Mars and
that the officials in charge of the program are covering up for some reason,
while 10% think that the Viking probes were not sent to Mars at all but
rather to the Moon. All in all, there exists a great public mistrust of
our officials and their ethics. Undoubtedly, some mistrust is present due
to the past cover-ups and accusations that have come forth from some of
our government agencies, one against the other.</P>

<P>&quot;I do feel that we managed to land these two probes on the planet
Mars, but that their true findings and most pictures are classified material
which to this day have not been shown.</P>

<P>&quot;My research has resulted in the following findings:</P>

<P>&quot;We were told that Mars is about one-half the size of the earth,
with a surface gravity of about 40% in relation to our own earth and that
the atmospheric pressure is some 7.7 millibars in comparison to about one
thousand milibars on earth. The Martian atmospheric density is reported
to be less that 1% of that of earth. We were also told that the Martian
temperatures in Fahrenheit ranged from -22 degrees below zero at early
afternoon to -122 degrees below zero at night. Viking One, which landed
close to the Martian equator, recorded a colder temperature than Viking
Two, which touched down some one thousand miles farther north, closer to
the polar caps.</P>

<P>Atmospheric measurements. The argon content of the Martain atmosphere
was not 30% as they had thought but only 3%. A mistake of the same magnitude
was admitted when a much higher water vapor reading was received then we
have thought possible from earth measurements.</P>

<P>&quot;Dr. George Sands, of Mission Control, stated, 'It is obviously
wetter than we anticipated. There is ground fog at the landing site during
part of the day. Thirty microns of water have been found in the atmosphere,
enough to cause not only ground fog but also frost and snow.'</P>

<P>&quot;I am not a scientist, but I have studied meteorology enough to
be able to say that the evidence of ground fog on Mars proves that temperatures
there are much warmer than we are told by the official reports. Ground
fog is a product of warm moist air moving across cool land masses or water.
Ground fog, as with any type of fog, is a product of temperatures above
the freezing level of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.</P>

<P>&quot;It is also interesting to note that evaporation clouds have been
photographed at an estimated altitude of fifteen thousand feet AGL (above
ground level). I can assure you that condensation clouds or any other clouds
including simple ground fog cannot exist at the reported atmospheric pressure
of only 7.7 millibars. Evaporation clouds on earth may reach up to forty
thousand feet, but even at that altitude our atmospheric pressure is still
two hundred millibars, enough to support such clouds.</P>

<P>&quot;We are told that evaporation clouds exist up to fifteen thousand
feet on Mars. The temperatures, therefore, must be ABOVE the freezing point
of 32 degrees Fahrenheit up to at least fifteen thousand feet. When rising
moist air moves upward it condenses at a given altitude and forms clouds
at given altitudes depending upon the temperatures. This we call the dewpoint
level. One must note at this point that low temperatures such as the reported
-122 degrees Fahrenheit on Mars may certainly exist in certain zones but
not everywhere. We have recorded temperatures of -127 degrees Fahrenheit
here on Earth at the Antarctica, and we know that life exists here on this
planet.</P>

<P>&quot;Regarding the Viking landers, we find some other unexplained points
to ponder.</P>

<P>&quot;The Viking landers were reported to have an earth weight of twelve
hundred pounds. According to our reports of the Martian gravity the landers
would weigh approximately four hundred eighty pounds. The parachute was
fifty feet in diameter. A fifty foot parachute with a weight of four hundred
eighty pounds dangling from it would slow that payload down sufficiently
in the earth's atmosphere for a proper adjustment in velocity at retro-rocket
firing. However, in the low density fo the Martain atmosphere, as we are
told (less than one percent of ours), a fifty foot parachute would have
no slowing effect at all. It is even doubtful that in the legendary atmosphere
there exists enough air molecules to open the chute. Calculating the size
of the parachute needed in such a thin atmosphere, the canopy would have
to be some seventy five hundred feet in diameter. The question then arises
where would such a thing be stored and what would such a load weigh? Certainly
at least two thousand pounds. It would take up about two hundred square
feet of space to store it. That is more cubic space and weight than the
entire lander itself. So, since they did use a fifty foot chute the air
on Mars is much more dense than they tell us. I would say a density of
about 40% of that of earth.</P>

<P>&quot;The lander on the fifty foot chute separated at four thousand
feet AGL, and activated its three descent rockets, which, like gigantic
blow torches, slowed down the craft to a successful soft landing. However,
the three rocket engines develop not only thousands of degrees of heat
but immense thrust. These two factors not only completely sterilized the
landing site before touchdown, but blew away all the soil of biological
value for a least one hundred feet surrounding the lander. We should question
the ability to find any signs of life in such soil. The scientists should
have questioned this. Maybe they did. In the meantime, that little shovel
keeps on digging and searching in that sterilized soil.</P>

<P>&quot;The magazine 'Scientific American' had this to say in a recent
article on Mars: 'The Martian environment is by no means so hostile as
to exclude LIFE. Our hopes for obtaining a definitive answer from the Viking
mission should not be too high.'</P>

<P>&quot;Other interesting points are to be found. For example, sand dunes
on Mars photographed by the 'orbiter' have the same height and the same
dune to dune spacing as earth's sand dunes to be found in the Sangre de
Christo mountains in Colorado. In a Martain atmosphere of less than one
percent of ours these sand dunes could under no circumstances be there!</P>

<P>&quot;It has been suggested that hurricane-like winds of two hundred
mph or better are needed to move these grains of sand on Mars but up to
now there has been no logical explanation as to where these two hundred
mph winds come from in a total sub-zero environment. Again, Mars must be
warmer in at least some regions to create wind of any speed in the first
place. As we know, wind is created by warm air rising from the ground to
be replaced by colder air masses filling in the gap. The Viking lander
only recorded winds up to forty mph, not two hundred. So, how did the dunes
get there? Even better, how did the wind get there in an atmosphere that
is only one percent of earth's and at a temperature of -120 degrees Fahrenheit?</P>

<P>&quot;I think that we have to be sensible about all of this, for it
can be seen that too many things just don't seem to make logical sense.
Certainly if we can figure this out the scientists and others working on
the project can. Some talk from both sides of the mouth does seem to be
taking place.</P>

<P>&quot;Viking 2 reveals that the polar caps of Mars are plain snow, just
frozen water. Also, that it snows often, and the atmosphere above the poles
is saturated with water vapor. Sounds good? Let us continue. A NASA article
reports that the poles of Mars are all frozen water with temperatures of
-90 degrees Fahrenheit to -120 degrees Fahrenheit. The article continues
by saying, 'The North Pole is now going through its summer, so the ice
cap is as small as it ever gets.' I would like to know how ice in sub-zero
temperatures as reported above can MELT!</P>

<P>&quot;Dr. Martin, who has just recently resigned his position with Pasadena
Viking Control, said at the International Academy of Astronautics, 'Our
biology instruments on Mars have received positive signs of LIFE in forms
of biology even though we cannot find organics.' It is amazing that they
have found even those little signs at such a blow-torched landing site.</P>

<P>&quot;Analysis of the Martian environment has so far shown that there
is carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sufficient amounts of water vapor. Are
not these the basic ingredients for LIFE?</P>

<P>&quot;Quoting NASA from Pasadena, 'If we would have placed the Viking
landers in our Pasadena parking lot and received the same chemical and
biological readings from there as we are now receiving from Mars, we would
have called it a definite sign of life.' I leave it to you to figure out
what the might mean.</P>

<P>&quot;I feel that so long as we are going to send probes out to other
worlds with our assumptions that life is unique only to our little earth,
instead of being able to see that all worlds are basically made up of the
same 'stuff', we shall continue to be plagued with unyielding difficulties
and insoluble questions.</P>

<P>&quot;Planets do not only receive warmth from their sun in forms of
friction by rays striking their atmospheres, but also by the same process,
warmth from the planet is drawn out of its body, radiating and warming
up the atmosphere. All planets need an atmosphere simply to equalize the
pressures set up from within. No planet could exist without air, for it
would disintegrate otherwise in a given time.</P>

<P>&quot;The water quantity on Mars has been analyzed to be sufficient
to cover their whole planet with an ocean of ONE MILE in depth, should
all its water now in and under the ground be released. While the polar
caps themselves show a thickness measuring one-half mile.</P>

<P>&quot;Perhaps the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli's earlier reports
of the Martian channels do not all seem so impossible when they are compared
with Dr. Daniel J. Milton's recent findings. Dr. Milton, a geologist with
the U.S. Geological Survey, stated in 'Science Newsfront': 'We have photographed
the Martian mystery channels. They resemble huge flood channels some twenty-four
miles wide and several hundred miles long, shaped by sudden discharges
of water that dwarf the flow of the Amazon River.'</P>

<P>&quot;Finally, here is a report from the wires of the AP: 'New pictures
of Mars' northern regions reveal mysterious patters, resembling contour
plowing on the planet's red surface and scientists say they cannot find
a natural explanation. 'We are getting some strange things. It is very
puzzling,' said Michael Carr, member of the team interpreting pictures
of Mars from the Viking 2 orbiter. Carr stated that the newest pictures
of the target zone showed striped patterns that resemble an aerial photograph
of a farmer's field after plowing. 'The stripes are too regular to be of
natural causes,' Carr stated. But what caused them? 'I really can't tell
you all of the possibilities that were suggested.' Carr responded. 'But
many suggestions were that it was MAN MADE.'</P>

<P>&quot;I would like to point out the most important fact that the suggestion
of man-made plowing by the Viking scientists was made AFTER Viking One
could not find life on Mars as we were looking for it.</P>

<P>&quot;To conclude this article, I would like to give credit where credit
is due and report that even as we receive double talk on the extra-terrestrial
findings, we have, as a civilization, gained enormous knowledge by venturing
out into space. We have learned more about our earth from out there by
observation and photography than is presently realized by the general public.
Space satellites placed into earth orbit have revealed our global pollution
problems. We have learned about the weather patterns, the ocean currents,
mineral deposits, soil analysis, flood control, forestry service, and higher
yield agricultural areas, both presently cultivated and those as yet unused.</P>

<P>&quot;Through out earth orbiting probes we have also found that we are
not always perfect. In the early days we received reports that life could
not exist even on our own planet. Those probes reported back that there
was not enough water vapor or oxygen to support life as we know it on Earth!
Therefore we know that the probes are not always accurate. Much depends
upon the pressures and amount of magnetism that surrounds the probes in
space when the readings are taken.</P>

<P>&quot;As it is yet to be revealed, Man's futures on this earth will
depend upon outer space research and exploration for it is from out there
that he will be able to evaluate that small world he now calls 'home'.
But one day when things become unbearable, we will be forced to venture
out to find other worlds ready for inhabitation.</P>

<P>&quot;Every dollar spend in this program is well spent. It can keep
many busy in the peaceful way, while he is learning. The space program
has all the potentials to allow man to one day explore space and work together
as brothers, so thoroughly occupied in it, that there is no time left for
foolish wars that only add additional woes and miseries to mankind.</P>

<P>&quot;Man calls himself the most intelligent creature on Earth. He will
soon have the Golden Opportunity to prove it.&quot;</P>

<P>Bradford D. Smith, NASA scientist and head of the 1980 Voyager's photographic
mission to Saturn, had this statement to make, which I feel covers or explains
some of the mysteries that have baffled us about outer space. Smith stated,
&quot;With any scientific investigation of this magnitude, many of our
long-standing theories-those cherished interpretations of the Universe
around us, are going to become casualties.&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Robert Jastrow, the founder and director of NASA's Goddard Institute
for space studies, was interviewed by science reported Marcia Golub of
the Special Science Digest magazine, Spring edition of 1980. In this revealing
article, titled &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, Dr. Jastrow states very positively
that life exists there. From his studies of the Viking data, there is no
doubt, Jastrow admitted, that at least some form of primitive life exists
on Mars.</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow now teaches at both Columbia University and Darthmouth College.
&quot;But even primitive life forms such as microbes are quite complicated
forms of life,&quot; Dr. Jastroy concluded, &quot;because these would settle
the question: 'Is Life common in the cosmos?' We can be sure that humanity
is not alone, that planets circling other stars must be swarming with life,
and that in solar systems older than ours, this life may be far more advanced
than humanity on Earth.&quot;</P>

<P>Reporter Golub asked Dr. Jastrow this important question: &quot;Do you
think there is life on Mars? Some scientists disagree. Why?&quot;</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow answered, &quot;My only comment is that scientific caution
is fine if you spend $30.00 of your own money. But if you spend millions
of dollars of somebody else's money, you have to stand the heat. Also scientists
are very sensitive to being wrong.&quot;</P>

<P>During the Viking 1 microbe test on Mars, nutrients with radioactive
carbon was the food presented to possible Martian microbes. If the microbes
ate the food, they would exhale radioactive carbon dioxide, and if the
geiger counter clicked, the microbes were eating the food. The geiger counter
clicked thousands of times. While many of the Viking scientists tried to
explain this positive result as a way of being merely a chemical reaction,
several others, such as Dr. Jastrow, for instance, insisted that this reaction
was a biological one. As a matter of fact, the Viking 2 test produced exactly
the same positive reaction, as the Martian microbes ate away the radioactive
carbon laden nutrients. Nevertheless, the arguments continued as to whether
these tests were chemical or biological reactions.</P>

<P>The soil samples were stored for several months in the Viking lander
storage area and the microbe test was again repeated, and this time the
geiger counter signal disappeared. Dr. Jastrow explains that if one stores
living organisms in the dark, without food and water for several months,
they die.</P>

<P>This was the convincing fact arguing for the existence of Martian microbes,
as the first sign of life on Mars. Dr. Jastrow also stated that Dr. Levin,
who did the microbe test, also believes that these test results prove life
on Mars. But using Jastrow's own words, &quot;Dr. Levin has been a little
restrained by peer pressure from the Viking team.&quot;</P>

<P>Chief biologist Chuck Klein now admits that on the basis of the Viking
1 and 2 microbe tests, the conclusion would have to be drawn that metabolizing
organisms were definitely present in all the samples tested. &quot;That
means life on Mars exists,&quot; Dr. Klein stated.</P>

<P>Dr. Jastrow concludes with these remarks: &quot;The taxpayer got a better
return on the money he invested in Mars than he realized, but nobody has
told him. It has killed the Mars exploration program.&quot;</P>

<P>In certain scientific circles, it has been common knowledge for quite
some time now, that life exists on the Moon, on Mars, and many other planets
as well. Just because the general public is not aware of this fact does
not make it less true. While Dr. Jastrow is a very cautious man, revealing
only primitive life forms on Mars, other scientists are more outspoken.</P>

<P>One retired physicist with whom I had the privilege of spending an afternoon,
in the summer of 1980, discussed life on other worlds, UFOs, and their
propulsion methods quite openly with me. This gentleman related to me,
with revealing candor, that several friends of his, all top scientists,
had been taken to the Moon and Mars by the extraterrestrials. There are
several secret bases here on Earth, above the 15,000 foot level in mountainous
areas, where alien spacecraft land. These voyages, this scientist acknowledged
to me, are not joy rides, but have an extremely valuable scientific purpose.</P>

<P>In addition, George Adamski reported in his book, Inside The Space Ships,
that on many of his voyages into space, during the 1950's, top scientists
were also taken along. Whatever these gentlemen learned from these voyages
were later put into constructive use, without revealing the source of their
information.</P>

<P>Adamski was also told by his contacts that while the air is very thin
on the Moon, there are certain areas where even Earth men could walk around
without a space suit and air tanks, but it would take twenty-four hours
of depressurization to get their bodies acclimated to this condition. He
was also told that those men from other planets visiting the Moon must
experience the same procedure of depressurization.</P>

<P>The scientist with whom I conversed in the summer of 1980 revealed to
me very much the same information. He stated that when this group of selected
scientists reached the Moon, they were told by their hosts they could take
a walk on the surface without space suits. Nevertheless, they were given
small oxygen bottles with the explanation that they would feel very ill,
very shortly, in those conditions to which they were unaccustomed. They
did not go through twenty-four hours of depressurization. This group was
later taken to planet Mars where they, to their surprise, found it to be
inhabited with human beings. They were told that about six hundred million
people live on Mars, and that the surface air pressure at sea level was
equal to a 20,000 foot altitude here on earth. Since Mars is a bit smaller
than one-half of Earth, this air pressure seemed to be sufficient enough
there because of less gravitational attraction. A one hundred pound Earth
person would weigh less than fifty pounds on Mars.</P>

<P>Even though this story sounds rather fantastic, I have no reason to
disbelieve this gentleman, who struck me as a very mentally alert and honest
man, still engaged in electromagnetic research in a private capacity. As
a matter of fact, he too has been invited to take the same trip into outer
space as his friends did some time ago. He told me that he would share
all the information upon his return, whenever that will be.</P>

<P>The book, Alternative 3, speaks of a secret Mars mission by the U.S.A.
and the U.S.S.R. in 1962. According to the authors of this book, a copy
of this secret Mars tape and the special decoder were stolen from NASA
in the United States, and transported to Britain via Canada. There this
tape was shown to top officials and scientists in the late 70's. This tape
revealed that on May 22, 1962, these two super powers, in a consolidated
effort, landed a remote-controlled spacecraft on Mars, which reported a
temperature and atmospheric pressure sufficient to support life as we know
it. Alternative 3 was written by three well-known British television reporters,
which produced a TV program with that same title, shown by the BBC TV network
in 1977, with the book following in June, 1979. The retired physicist who
had presented me with the information concerning the Moon and Mars, also
pointed out to me that the book Alternative 3, contained a vast amount
of truth.</P>

<P>Searching for this type of truth is not an easy matter because the governments
involved in such projects prefer to clamp a tight lid on their findings.
However, in time, the truth will always be revealed, because only a few
men can take such secrets into their graves, and sooner or later, information
will leak out.</P>

<P>To receive the total picture of the truth, those of us who are interested
in finding it must never cease to investigate every little part of it,
patiently piecing together the puzzle picture until we see it clearly.
It has been said that &quot;Man know the truth and it shall make you free.&quot;
The involvement of man's intellect or his mind alone is not enough, as
often truth is revealed to us through intuitive feeling, or hunches, which
come to us through conscious awareness.</P>

<P>I feel that man will have no chance to see the total picture of truth,
unless he uses both elements of his being, his mind and his conscious awareness,
in harmony. Only then he will be able to see the total picture of the truth
and at the same time be capable of handling it.</P>

   <TITLE>Nuclear Subselene Tunneling Machines On the Moon?</TITLE>
   <META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Mozilla/3.0Gold (Win95; I) [Netscape]">
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<P>From the book &quot;<B>Underground Bases and Tunnels</B>, by Richard
Sauder, Ph.D., ISBN 0-9644979-0-5 </P>

<P><B>Nuclear Subselene Tunneling Machines On the Moon? </B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT>o discussion of government plans for secret tunneling
projects would be complete without considering NASA's plans for tunneling
on the Moon. </P>

<P>1980s documents from Los Alamos National Laboratory and from Texas A&amp;M
University (under contract to NASA) indicate that there are plans to use
&quot;nuclear subselene tunneling machines&quot; to melt tunnels under
the Moon's surface, to make living, working, mining and transportation
facilities for a lunar colony. </P>

<P>A 1986 Los Alamos report calls for using a fission powered, nuclear
subselene to provide the heat to &quot;melt rock and form a self-supporting,
glass-lined tunnel suitable for Maglev or other high-speed transport modes.&quot;
The report recommends burrowing beneath the surface because of the harsh
lunar environment. <I>(This would apply to Mars as well. --SW)</I> It further
mentions that the tunnels would 'need to be hundreds, or thousands of kilometers
long ...&quot; The actual subselenes would be automatic devices, remotely
operated. In 1986, Los Alamos estimated each subselene could be built for
about $50 million and transported to the Moon for anywhere from $155 million
to $2,323 million. The price tag may seem exorbitantly high, but rest assured
that there is easily that much, and more, available in the military's &quot;black&quot;
budget for covert projects. It should be noted that the report did not
specify how the subselenes and their crews would be transported to the
Moon. <I>(Large, triangular combination jet/ion-drive powered 'antigravity'
craft, or other advanced technologies generally unknown to the public?
--SW)</I> </P>

<P>A 1988 Texas A&amp;M study outlined plans for a slightly different model
of lunar tunnel boring machine. The Texas A&amp;M &quot;Lunar Tunneler&quot;
would employ a &quot;mechanical head to shear its way through the lunar
material while creating a rigid ceramic-like lining&quot;. Essentially,
this kind of machine would be a hybrid, mechanical TBM (Tunnel Boring Machine)
that incorporates elements of the nuclear powered subselene. Although the
machine would be nuclear powered it would have a mechanical cutter head
that would bore through the lunar subsurface. Just behind the cutter head
would be a &quot;heating section&quot; that would &quot;melt a layer of
lunar material within the excavated tunnel to a depth of only a few inches.
This molten material could then be cooled to form a rigid ceramic material
suitable for lining the interior of the tunnel.&quot; </P>

<P>The Texas A&amp;M designers considered a couple of different muck disposal
schemes. The two variants of the first called for the muck to be transferred
vertically to the surface and either dumped or &quot;sprayed&quot; into
a tailings pile. The second concept called for the use of special, tunnel
dump trucks that would carry the muck out of the tunnel and dump it on
the lunar surface. The designers recommend use of a SP-100 fission reactor
for power, using liquid lithium heat pipes of the sort developed by the
Los Alamos National Laboratory for the nuclear subterrene. </P>

<P>A second Texas A&amp;M study, released in May 1988, also recommended
use of a lithium cooled nuclear reactor as the power source for a lunar
tunneler. In the second tunneler design, there are no mechanical tunneling
components. Instead, the cone-shaped, nuclear powered tunneler melts its
way through the subsurface like a subterrene. Some of the melted rock and
soil is plastered against the tunnel walls to form a glass-like ceramic
tunnel lining. The rest of the melted muck (called regolith) is passed
out of the back of the tunneler and then carried to the surface for the
disposal by the dump trucks that follow the tunneler through the tunnel.
</P>

<P>I don't know if there are nuclear tunneling machines secretly making
permanent bases and tunnels on the moon. But NASA plans certainly give
cause to wonder. </P>

<P><I>(And some of the images from the Clementine and Apollo missions of
the numerous anomalous structures on the surface of moon, especially the
near infrared images which Richard Hoagland believes show a network of
structures both above and below the lunar surface, give even more cause
to wonder. --SW) </I></P>

<center><h1>Workspace 4.0 Information</h1></center>

<p>Workspace<sup>&copy;</sup> is the first robot simulation and off-line programming application running on the Windows 95 platform. The ability to take the simulation directly to the shop floor, allows users to eliminate time and inefficiencies associated with Silicon Graphics based systems costing up to 3 times the price of Workspace.</p>


<p><img src="gemcity.gif" width=200 height=150 border=1 align="RIGHT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot" hspace=5 vspace=5>Workspace 4.0 is the culmination of over 10 years of development to create a seamless simulation to programming application. Workspace 4.0 utilizes the latest in 32-bit graphics technology to give users GUI and screen representations that rival the Silicon Graphics machines. With reflective screen shading and solid 3D modeling, users will see their simulations come to life on the screen.</p>

<p>Workspace is the first seamless off-line robot programming system that allows users to program the simulation robot in the native language of their controller. The benefit is an immediate capability to download to the robot for testing and evaluation. There is no limit to the number of robots, brands and models that can be mixed within the simulation and programs written simultaneously to the cell design process.</p>

 
<p><img src="turbine.gif" width=200 height=143 border=1 align="LEFT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot" hspace=5 vspace=5>Workspace runs on the #1 selling PC platform, Windows 95, and is suitable for Windows NT. The portability of running on a personal computer or notebook allows users to take the applications out of the design room and directly to the production floor. This puts the power of engineering directly to the production line.</p> 

<p>Off-line programming has been deemed in the "Twilight Zone" of the robotics industry. At RWT, we create reality with Workspace as the software engine and <a href="robotrak/robotrak.htm" target="Main">Robotrak<sup>&copy;</sup></a>, robot calibration and signaturing. The missing component to achieving effective OLP in robotics is being able to consistently predict where the robot is going to go in relative space to the part and how that corresponds to the coordinates plotted in the programming application. This technology is now available and affordable. With paybacks of 10 times the initial investment in the first year by minimizing downtime Workspace and Robotrak will take your company out of the "Twilight Zone."</p>

<p><img src="spotweld.gif" width=200 height=150 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=1 align="RIGHT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot">Another component of the Workspace OLP process is the ability to import existing robot programs from the controllers, apply Robotrak calibrations and/or edit the program then re-install them into the robot controller by conventional means. By seamlessly creating the robot program while generating the simulation, Workspace also eliminates post-processing which has proven to create robot programs that, due to their miscalculations and language translations, defeat the benefits of OLP. Workspace, through native language programming, gives you a robot program that is ready to run your applications. Workspace has 28 of the most popular <a href="rbtlang/rbtlang.htm" target="Main">robot languages</a> ready for your use.</p>

<p>Simulation of robot workcells has taken on a new meaning with Workspace. Historically linked and housed in the design and engineering departments, Workspace on the PC now allows users to move from the traditional simulation departments and utilize the cell development process throughout the design to manufacturing arena. Workspace 4.0 has CAD importation of IGES and DXF to give quick access to your existing 3-D, solid model part, fixture and tool data. </p>

<p><img src="deburr.gif" width=200 height=150 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="LEFT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot">With a library of over 170 <a href="rbtlib/rbtlib.htm" target="Main">robot models</a>, we can generally provide your new or older, robot model with your order. If you have a model we do not have in the library, we can quickly model it and provide you a model with accurate kinematics.</p>

<p>Workspace 4.0 is easy to use and learn. Our corporate training facility in Fort Myers Beach, FL holds <a href="training/schedule.html" target="Main">monthly training classes </a>where you will learn the techniques to maximize your use of Workspace and Robotrak. With the look and feel of Windows based applications, Workspace has a short learning curve and a robot programming or CAD background will decrease your time to implementation.</p>

to other pages that provide more information on a particular topic. At the

<I>is</I> Workspace?
</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Workspace is a graphical
three-dimensional robot simulation and off-line programming software program. It
allows users to construct workcells and write programs for robots. Once this has
been done, Workspace has a number of analysis tools for a user to check the
feasibility of a workcell. These tools include reach and envelope analysis,
collision detection, throughput, and cycle time analysis.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">What is unique about Workspace?</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Workspace is unique for two main reasons.
First, <B>Workspace runs on a PC</B>. Most graphical robot simulation programs
require high-end (and very expensive) graphics workstations (like those made by
Silicon Graphics) to operate. Workspace will operate on any mainstream
IBM-compatible personal computer.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Second, <B>Workspace writes robot
programs in the native language of the robot</B>. Each robot manufacturer has
it's own robot programming language. All other robot simulation programs require
you to work in a &quot;simulator language&quot; that is similar to, but unlike,
all robot languages.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Why
would I want a robot simulation program to run on a PC?
</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The ability to run on a
PC, or notebook, is important for two reasons. The first, obviously, is price.
PCs, even high-end PCs, are significantly cheaper than a graphics workstation.
Because of this, virtually every employee has one on his/her desk already. Even
engineers with graphic workstations also have a PC on their desk. The reason is
obvious, most mainstream programs, like word-processing, e-mail, spreadsheets,
etc. are more easily obtained for PCs. We don't feel you should have to buy a
special computer just to run complex three-dimensional workcell simulations. 
<BR><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="shear.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Another advantage of running on a PC is it
allows you to take the simulation to the factory floor. If you are off-line
programming a robot, it is important for the simulation to closely match what
really exists in the real world. The only way to do this is to take the
simulation to the actual workcell. With graphics workstations this is not only
difficult, but most people do not want to take an expensive piece of equipment
(a graphics workstation) to an environment it might get damaged. Workspace can
run on a portable computer, allowing a user to easily take Workspace to the
factory floor with a minimal amount of hassle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD
COLSTART="2"><P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">Why is programming in the native language of the robot
important?</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">There are
several reasons why robots should be programmed in their native language. The
most important reason is compatibility with the robot controller. With Workspace
it is very easy to send programs to the robot controller. There are no
post-processors to add more steps, and more complications, to the process. Once
a program is written in Workspace, it can be run immediately on the robot
controller. Working in the native language of the robot also allows currently
running programs to be easily brought into, and edited, in Workspace, without
any pre-processing.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif"> Another advantage of programming in the
native language is it gets the user closer to the robot. The person creating the
simulation will know more about the capabilities of the robot, and a person who
is already familiar with the robot programming language will have no problem
adapting to using Workspace.

ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Robots are only a few of the machines that can

is very useful, since few robots operate by themselves without interaction with

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I've tried off-line programming before, and it hasn't
worked. Why?</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The reason
most off-line programming systems have failed in the past is because of a lack
of understanding of the fundamental problem with robots:  inaccuracy.
<A HREF="http://www.rwt.com/wsinfo/accrep/accrep.htm" target="Main">Robots are built to be
highly repeatable, but little consideration is being given to their accuracy.</A>
This really isn't a problem when using a teach pendant because the operator
positions the robot visually exactly like he/she wants it. What the actual x, y,
z coordinates are really doesn't matter.<BR>
<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="jclinden.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">This is a different story if you are off-line
programming. When you off-line program, you have a CAD drawing of where
everything is positioned, and you base the coordinates of the teachpoints on
this. This, in turn, is where the robot will move to. Off-line programming is
totally based on the x,y,z coordinates.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif"> Due to manufacturing tolerances and
stack-up, each robot is built slightly different. Since the robot manufacturers
make no effort to measure what these differences are, each robot controller
thinks it has a perfect robot connected to it. Therefore, when you send the
robot to a specific x,y,z coordinate, there is no guarantee that it makes it
there. In fact, robots are inaccurate by about 15 mm (0.59 inches), on average.

</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">How does Workspace correct for robot inaccuracies?</FONT></B>
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">There are two ways Workspace correct
for a robot's inaccuracy. The first is to account for the inaccuracies found in
the robot itself. This is done with a device called
<A HREF="http://www.rwt.com/wsinfo/robotrak/robotrak.htm" target="Main">Robotrak&#153;</A>.
Robotrak measures the differences between a robot's theoretical structure with
what the robot really looks like. This definition of what the robot looks like
is called the robots <B>&quot;signature,&quot;</B> and like a person's
signature, varies from example to example. Then, using Calibration+, a software
option in Workspace, a filter is placed in Workspace to insure that all
teachpoints in Workspace will be created in the correct x,y,z position.
<BR><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="robotrak.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="142"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The second method to improve a robots accuracy
is to more accurately define where the fixtures are relative to the robot.
Usually a workcell is designed in Workspace, and then it is assembled on the
factory floor. The actual, final position of the various fixtures are never
exactly the same as they were designed, and this affects where the teachpoints
are generated. The solution to this is to use a signatured robot to measure the
location of three well defined points on the fixture. By bringing these
positions into Workspace (as teachpoints), the model can be adjusted accordingly
to re-position the fixture in the exact location of the real fixture. This, in
turn, improves the accuracy of the final program.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The best thing about these two
methods is that the software to use them is seamlessly integrated into
Workspace. There are no separate programs to learn or third-party developers you
have to work with. One solution from one supplier.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><P>
<B><FONT SIZE="+2">How do I share my simulations with others?
</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">If another company you work with, like a
system integrator or installer, also has Workspace, then you can simply exchange
Workspace models and programs. This allows two companies to work closely
developing and implementing a robotic workcell.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Most of the time, however, the people you
would like to share your simulations with do not have Workspace. In that case,
you can create an animation, or short movie, of the Workspace simulation. This
is done by using the AVI file format to create an
animation from within Workspace that<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="wjet.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="139">
can be replayed on any PC with Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, whether they
have Workspace or not. Any animation created in Workspace
can be replayed on any PC. This allows for
real-time playback of an animation.<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Animation
files can be used to show a prospective customer how you plan to construct
his/her workcell, or as part of a proposal to get a new project approved. It is
also a very helpful way to convey the sometimes difficult task of how you plan
to operate a workcell. Looking at a three dimensional simulation is a lot more
descriptive than trying to decipher a two dimensional blueprint. Be sure to
download some sample animations below to see how this works.

<P>
<B>INHERENT PROBLEMS WITH OFF-LINE PROGRAMMING</B>
</P>
<P>
Once the decision has been made to off-line program robots, the next step in the
process is calibration. When working in the virtual world of robot simulation
and off-line programming, everything in the workcell is perfect. The robot is
accurate and the fixtures are perfectly placed.
</P>
<P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="rt.gif" ALT="Robotrak" BORDER="1" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="301" HEIGHT="269">
Once a program is taken to the floor, however, it is often found that the robot
is not placed exactly as it should have been, the fixture does not rotate in an
exact circle, and <a href="../accrep/accrep.htm" target="Main">the robot itself has inaccuracies</a> that have not been taken
into account in the simulation. These inaccuracies are not the fault of the
robot manufacturers, or the fixture installers, it is just a fact of life that
installations are not exact.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, this is the place where off-line programming has found it's
biggest critics. When the programs are first run, some programs miss the
teachpoints by as much as three inches. A robot operator must then go back and
re-teach the entire program with a teach pendant. Not only does this take time,
but the assumed advantage of off-line programming has been completely negated.
</P>
<P>
Besides the money and time spent re-programming the robot with the teach
pendant, a significant amount of money is also spent trying to duplicate exactly
the positioning of the robot and fixtures. Using lasers and other high-tech
devices, the fixtures and robots in a factory are placed as accurately and as
level as possible. Although this improves the chances the program will work, it
is still not as accurate as the simulation<I>. As much as $50,000 per workcell
can be spent to get the positioning &quot;close.&quot;</I>
</P>
<P>
The robot in the simulation does not suffer from the inaccuracies of the real
robot (tolerances in the manufacturing process, backlash, and general wear and
tear). In order to fix this there must be some way of finding these errors and
reducing them as much as possible. Once the errors are found they can be used to
modify the kinematics of the robot model within the simulation.
</P>
<P>
<B>ROBOTRAK IS THE SOLUTION</B>
</P>
<P>
The solution to this is to find the &quot;signature&quot; of the robot and the
workcell through calibration. Calibration only really works, however, if it is
tied directly to a simulation program When tied with a simulation program, the
kinematics of the robot model can more easily be modified.
</P>
<P>
<IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="comps.gif" ALT="Robotrak Components" BORDER="1" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="276">Robotrak
is an optional measuring system for Workspace, a PC-based simulation and
off-line programming system. It is capable of measuring static positions or
motion paths to an accuracy of 0.2 mm (0.008 inches) in three dimensions. The
software needed to analyze the robot performance and to modify the robot model's
kinematics is combined within Workspace as one piece of seamless software. No
other system offers this worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Robotrak calibration system consists of the following components:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Three incremental encoder measuring units.
</LI>
<LI>A robot end effector interface.
</LI>
<LI>An ISA computer interface card.
</LI>
<LI>A reference bar of known length.
</LI>
<LI>A PC running Workspace with the Calibration+ option.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
<B>USING ROBOTRAK</B>
</P>
<P>
The three high resolution encoder units are placed anywhere within the working
envelope of the robot The units should be placed roughly at the corners of an
equilateral triangle. This placement does not have to be precise, however,
setting the units in a straight line must be avoided. The encoder units are then
plugged into the computer running Workspace through the data acquisition card.
</P>
<P>
A non-stretch cord with a constant tension on it is then pulled from each of the
encoder units and calibrated with the use of a reference bar. Once a conversion
of encoder counts to length is established for each unit, the relative distance
between the three encoder units is determined by pulling the cords from each
unit to the adjacent unit. At this point the encoder units are ready to begin
calibrating the robot.
</P>
<P>
<B>FINDING A ROBOT'S &quot;SIGNATURE&quot;</B>
</P>
<P>
Each cord is then pulled from the encoder and attached to the robot end-effector
interface, which has already been attached to the robot faceplate or tool. Once
the cords are in position, Robotrak uses the length of each cord to determine
the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the robot end-effector, essentially becoming a
Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM).
</P>
<P>
The robot is then moved through 50 points in space, and at each point the
Workspace software records the robot's position through the three Robotrak
encoders. Over the length of the test, as many joints as possible should be
moved. The points can either be taught manually with a teach pendant, or
generated in Workspace and downloaded into the robot controller. This teachpoint
file can then be kept in the controller for any future time when the robot may
need to be re-calibrated.
</P>
<P>
Once the points have been recorded, Workspace will compare the measured
positions (where the robot actually was) with the teachpoints (where the robot
thought it was), and the errors associated with the kinematics of the robot are
extracted and stored within Workspace. Errors which are detected include:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The zero position of each joint (where the values of the joint variables is
zero).
</LI>
<LI>The length of each link and the distance offset at each link.
</LI>
<LI>The compliance at each joint.
</LI>
<LI>Robotrak will also calculate the tool offset if a tool is attached to the
robot.
</LI> 
</UL>
<P>
Once these errors are calculated, the kinematics of the robot model in Workspace
are modified to account for the differences between the real robot and the robot
model A filter is then used within Workspace to modify the teachpoint file so
that they represent actual positions on the real-world robot controller.
Programs can then be generated by Workspace that will be precise, sending the
robot to the correct position in real space.
</P>
<P>
<B>CALIBRATING A WORKCELL</B>
</P>
<P>
Positions of fixtures and other peripheral equipment within a workcell can also
be measured and merged into Workspace, allowing for the calibration of an entire
workcell Even individual stations within a rotating fixture can be measured to
take into account any errors between stations, or errors in the rotation of a
fixture. In essence, this is using the power of the Workspace software to make
any of the adjustments for inaccurate robots and the less accurate positioning
of equipment by calibrating the workcell once the equipment is in place. The
time and money spent getting the robot and fixtures precisely into place is
reduced.
</P>
<P>
The entire calibration process takes less than one hour per robot, including the
time it takes to set up the encoder units and calibrate them
</P>
<P>
However, the need to calibrate does not end once a workcell is set-up. If a
robot crashes during it's operation and bends a tool, Robotrak can be very
helpful. By setting up Robotrak and recording only a few points, the new  tool
offset can be determined. Then, through Workspace, the program can be
re-simulated to look for any collisions (using the collision detection feature
in Workspace) that may take place with the workpiece or a fixture. If there are
no collisions, the tool may be able to be used until the end of a shift,
limiting down-time. Also, as a robot ages, gear backlash and wear increase the
errors in a robot. By periodically re-calibrating a robot, the operator cam be
assured that any programs written for that robot will work.
</P>
<P>
Off-line programming can be of great value to a manufacturing firm. It allows
the robot to continue to operate while the program is being written, allows for
greater flexibility when writing programs, and more control over a process.
Interchangeability of programs between robot cells gives manufacturers
flexibility in scheduling and equipment utilization. Unless the robot is
calibrated, the program becomes little more than a guide to the robot operator
who will have to re-teach the entire program if it is too far off from what is
needed. Robotrak, along with Workspace, is the solution to this problem, and it
allows off-line programming to live up to its expectations.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>Workspace 4.0 - The Price is Right - FREE</center></h1>

<p>Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc., the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace has made the # 1 selling PC-based simulation and off-line programming package more affordable by making it possible to acquire it for free.
We work closely with robot integrators on a daily basis and recognize the barriers. By joining our Preferred Partners program, we can not only supply them with the system for free, but increase their
business through our lead referral program. This program has proven to be very successful for matching integration of robot cells and the use of Workspace for our customers.
</p>
<p>The program is based on the initial rental of Workspace. The Systems Integrator rents a minimum of one seat of Workspace. The base rental fee is $2100 per month with additional robot models and languages extra. They then are fully trained at the RWT-Workspace school in Fort Myers, FL and certified in the use of Workspace.</p>
<p>Once they are certified, they are eligible to rent additional Workspace systems to their customers. This benefits the S.I. in having a system on-site for post work and the customer a system for in-house use.</p> 
<p>The rental fee to the customer is billed monthly by RWT directly to eliminate hassles for the Preferred Partner. RWT then credits the Preferred Partner's monthly bill for 20% of the rental fee, averaging  $420 per month to the S.I..
It only takes 5 systems placed at customer sites to then have the use of one Workspace system for FREE each month. After 5 systems, the Preferred Partner can choose to add additional Workspace seats to their own facility or receive a monthly check for the residual income from the rentals of systems over 5.
</p><p>Preferred Partners can make additional monthly income from this program, but can then increase billable time on their own Workspace as more of their customers are using the system.</p>
<p>To go along with the Preferred Partner program is the lead referral program. A program that provides full, systems integration leads to the Preferred Partners that are using Workspace.</p>
<p>We have a number of calls each week from prospective robotics customers who are looking for someone to design, implement and program their specific application. Since we are not in the business of systems integration, we pass these on to the specialists, our Preferred Partners.</p>
<p>To find out how you can join the Preferred Partners program, contact your RWT Account Manager at 941-466-0488.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><center>Simulation Services Profitable</center></h1>

<p>Today's systems integrator is faced with more competition and a lower profit margin than ever before. Customers are pushing for more services, pre and post sales, lower billable time and the ability to use robots for more and more applications. The ability to stand out in the crowd is getting tougher.
Robot simulation is not a new tool, but with the advances in computer technology it is now becoming a tool everyone can utilize. No longer a toy of the automotive suppliers, PC based systems like Workspace are showing up on notebook computers and desktops. 
On the pre-sales side, the use of simulation to sell a concept and provide proof of implementation can make all of the difference when you are competing against 2D drawings and brochures. Not only does the prospect watch their new cell run, they can do it from their office or boardroom. This not only allows the S.I. to show what they plan to do, but gives the customer an interactive way to evaluate the process.
</p>
<p>In the design and layout phase, S.I.'s can maximize cell layouts with 3D accuracy, import part data and build the most efficient cell. The use of plastic robot models and cardboard mock ups can be replaced with accurate reach checks, collision detection and a myriad of evaluation tools only seen through simulation.
All of this comes as a cost to the customer who is anxious to see and know the cell they are purchasing will work and be implemented with the highest efficiency possible. The level of professional expertise conveyed through simulation is measurable by the amount of repeat business and referrals obtained from the happy customer.
For more details on how you can profit from offering simulation as a sales and profit tool, contact your RWT Account Manager at 941-466-0488.

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1><center>CEO Perspective<br>
Walt Weisel, CEO of RWT</center></h1>

<p>Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, relates how a recent customer saved hundreds of man hours and capital expenditure as a result of the use of simulation in robot cell layout.
"We were really an afterthought to the customers project plans for a large computer supplier." states Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc.(RWT). RWT is the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace, the world's first PC based robot simulation and off-line programming software package developed by Robotic Simulations, Ltd. of the UK. "The integrator gave us the project to model as a challenge to evaluate Workspace. Using their 2D CAD drawings and rough layout plans, we modeled the cell in Workspace&reg; and created a 3D animation that told them more than they were expecting to find. They had already purchased the robot and were building enclosures based on the 2D drawings and rough modeling in their shop. Which is a fairly standard practice in the industry for companies not using simulation."
</p>

<p>One of the first comments we got from their design team was that we were asking them questions about components of the cell they normally would not have researched until they were in the final phases of  build-up. So not only did we create a proactive approach to the design and layout, we later discovered several things that would have cost thousands more than the initial purchase of the software. We met with the customer at their facility with the robot setting in the back room awaiting the cell build-up.
"The first thing we proved through the simulation was the robot could not reach all of the fixtures it needed to. In a 2D CAD drawing it looked feasible, but when you add in the true reach of the robot model, they were coming up short. This was coupled with major collisions in the cycle that would have destroyed the fixtures and the controller monitor. They had also realized the cycle time shown in simulation was 30 seconds over contract time. Even under perfect cycle simulations, they were not going to make their goal and the goal their customer was expecting under contract. All in all, they would have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars including their reputation."
</p>

<p>"With the simulation in hand, they were able to quickly redesign the cell, reposition the robot, change fixtures and redevelop the entire process with the customer to achieve cycle times and actually exceed the customer's expectations. The ability of Workspace&acirc; to run on their notebook computer and they could easily take the simulation right to the customers desk, allowed them to graphically show the story and sell the customer without lengthy delays while they deciphered drawings and made their own calculations. They were also able to leave a copy of the simulation for the customer to run on their own PC, using the animation player feature of Workspace, the customer only needed to have a PC running Windows."
"This is just one of the success stories we have shared with customers and Workspace&acirc;." adds Walt. We have such an affordable alternative to the expensive UNIX- based systems that do not have the portability and versatility this program has to offer. For off-line programming, this system is without comparison in it's seamless, native language code writing for over 180 models of robots using 30+ different languages. We also have connectivity capabilities only available with a PC based system. We are bringing true, open-architecture to robot users who have been held hostage to antiquated technology."

<BODY BACKGROUND="wall.gif" BGCOLOR="FFFFFF"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Accuracy vs.
Repeatability</H1>
<P>There is much confusion in the industry about the differences between
accuracy and repeatability. The two terms are mutually exclusive, a robot does
not have to be accurate to be repeatable, and a robot does not have to be
repeatable to be accurate. It is important to understand the differences between
these two specifications.</P>

ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="repeat.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="134"></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" ALIGN="LEFT" COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Repeatability</FONT></B><BR>Repeatability
is the degree to which a robot is able to return to a specific translation or
position point in the workcell. In this procedure a robot is taught the required
point by moving the arm to the location with the teach pendant and then pushing
the program-point button. The repeatability specification thus describes <I>how
closely the robot arm reproduces the taught point</I> on each cycle of the
program execution. Notice on the bullseye to the left that the marksman has
grouped his shots close together, however his grouping is far from the bullseye.
Repeatability can be thought of as how good of a grouping can be made.</P></TD></TR><TR

<TD COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="acc.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="134"></TD>
<TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Accuracy</FONT></B><BR>Accuracy is
the degree to which a robot arm is able to move to a specific translation or
position point in the workcell when the point coordinates are entered from an
off-line programming station, calculated inside the program, or received from a
vision system. For example, a simulation program could specify that the arm
should move to a point described as X = 50.00 inches, Y = 45.30 inches, Z =
10.01 inches, Roll = 0.00 degrees, Pitch = 90.00 degrees, and Yaw = 100.00
degrees. The accuracy specification describes <I>how close the arm will be when
it moves to the desired point</I>. Typical robot accuracy is about two
magnitudes greater than the arm's repeatability. On the bullseye to the left,
notice that all the holes are centered around the middle of the target, but the
grouping is not very close together. You do not have to have good repeatability
to have good accuracy.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="MIDDLE" SRC="accrep.gif" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="134"></TD>
<TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Accuracy <I>and</I> Repeatability</FONT></B><BR>Accuracy
and repeatability are the measure of how close to a programmed point the robot
can come, and how close it gets to that same point again. Notice on the bullseye
that the points are centered around the middle of the target and are grouped
close together. This is good accuracy and repeatability. A robot in this
situation will  be the easiest to off-line program.</P></TD></TR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF"><H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Simulation Packages Change the Face
of Robotics</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by Walter K. Weisel</P>
<TABLE WIDTH="500"><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="t.gif" ALT="T">wenty-five years ago, when I became one of the
industry's handful of robotics originator's, we made a bold but correct
assumption.  We believed companies that did not introduce robotics into their
manufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edge they held and would
lose the major benefits that the technology offered in improved productivity,
higher quality products, and reduced tine.  We were right.</P><P>Today, after
nearly three decades of living with the limitations in technology, the robotics
industry is taking advantage of a new revolution: PC-based simulation.  Software
that combines off-line calibration of robot and workcell has catapulted robotics
into the fast lane worldwide.</P><P>Simulation packages have been developed
based on the premise that PC's would become faster, cheaper and contain more
memory.  Developers predicted the Pcs' capabilities in the future would bring
them to am operating level where computer workstations are today.  Even the most
daring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potential of PC-based
simulation software.  No one fathomed robotic simulations being done.  Receivers
need a personal computer with Microsoft Windows period.  Manufactures now are
focusing on these software developments, and the stakes are much higher than 25
or 30 years ago.</P><P>I predict this new approach to simulation, using a
standard PC, provides a universal solution to universal problems.</P><P>It is
changing the way we so business internationally now.  If you aren't already a
user, you are in the process of losing your competitive edge even as you read
this article.</P><P><B>OLD PROBLEMS,  NEW SOLUTIONS</B></P><P>Several
barriers have kept robotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robot
and workcell calibration from reaching fill potential.  Today, those barriers
are gone   Wiped out.  Demolished by this new PC-based approach.  The
state-of-the-art for simulation is altered.</P><P>One of the greatest
challenges has been to devise a way to send a program to a robot, a program that
makes the robot perform flawlessly without human intervention.  Historically,
we've demanded inexpensive robot  hardware, then assumed the self-limited
posture that it's perfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and teach its
points by hand.  I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendent
must not be an acceptable way of life.</P><UL>
<LI><I>It's been an industry constant because to date, we never knew what the
real robot on the floor looked and acted like in comparison to what the &quot;perfect&quot;
robot in simulation-software looked and acted like.  It didn't matter that we
copied the manufacturer's specifications exactly.The mechanical model always had
something that didn't match the specified data.  Robots always have been
manufactured to be repeatable, not accurate.  The new generation of PC-based
simulation software solves that problem.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Price/performance has always been a major barrier.  The old method
required a non-portable computer system to operate the software.  Total costs
are about $110,000.  These systems have failed to successfully perform off-line
programming functions because they do not take into account the actual robot
kinematics.  Quantifying the actual robot's kinematics is left up to the others
at substantially higher costs.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation's costs benefits and tine saving have industry members
looking for the fine print, the down side.  There is none.  Simulation, the
robotics industry breakthrough that users have been waiting for, and it s
already started to change the fabric of North American manufacturing.  Even
companies receiving proposals and products from suppliers now are insisting on
vendor simulations to accompany their proposals.  This forces a complete
analysis of a pries down the line to the component level.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Statistical analysis in simulation means we can provide predictions of
overall production on an annualized basis.  Once a user has created the
simulation, he or she can analyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment in
a workcell.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation now can be used to layout the entire manufacturing prices-
from concept to finished production.  A user has the ability to &quot;test drive&quot;
a system at all levels of the process before committing hardware.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulations can be transmitted worldwide for analysis via E-mail of
Internet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales, engineering, manufacturing
advantage.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation, formerly regarded as an engineering function, one becomes
an affordable vendor tool to show prospective buyers that the system works, and
the vendor has done his or her homework.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costly crashes and
downtime.</I></LI></UL><P>Simulation now provides an answer to the challenge of
calibration to be used in production.  This is rarely, if ever, the case.  :Lets
assume that the robot ordered  can reach exactly 2 meters.  But constraints in
the reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in every
robot.   The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach 2 meters,
it may fall 20-30 millimeters short.  Unless a calibrated robot model is used in
the simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work.  This
decade-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocate
parts of the system.  Software simulation now locates the problem before the
machines are bolted down, re-verifies at the time of installation, assists in
correcting any remaining problems.</P><P>Anyone who has even a passing
acquaintance of PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn't need
to ask, &quot;What's on the horizon?&quot;  But I love it when they ask anyway. 
My predictions for the industry include:</P><P>Best estimates suggest the size
of the North American simulation market today is between $30 and $35 million. I
have now doubt that in the next couple of years, the market will have surged to
over $100 million, and the wave's crest isn't even in sight.</P><P>Within the
next two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry of PC-based open
architecture controls.  They will replace today's specialized controls that
require specialized interfaces.  I believe that leading PC simulation software
packages will plug and play on mist-if not all- of those PC controllers.  We'll
see- and demand- PC-based, resident  simulation in engineering at vendor
facilities builders shops and at production facilities.</P><P>Simulation will
be neutral to the robot and specific to the application. Systems integrators and
robot users will demand objective analyses of the entire range of robot 
manufacturing, and robot manufacturers therefore will not be in the field of
objective simulation analysis of robotic systems.</P><P>Factories with robots
from different manufacturers will increasingly rely on simulation and demand
services from companies that do not have ties to robot or supplier companies. 
Users will insist on an objective evaluation of robot function and system
performance  for a wide range of manufacturers products.</P><P>PC-based
simulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers and users, and the
transition is underway.</P><P>Robot Simulation, Ltd., UK's research and
development team that selected the personal computer for simulation software
development, broke out of the mainframe minutes that crippled progress for
years.  What they created - a portable,  PC-based robotic simulation  program
with off-line programming and on-line robot calibration capabilities- means
every robotics manufacturer, systems integrator and robot user can have access
to an affordable and effective tool for increasing production profits.  I
believe, without hesitation or doubt, that PC-based simulation technology is the
sleeping giant of the 1990's.  And the giant has just yawned.</P><HR

<TABLE WIDTH="600"><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="w.gif" ALT="W">orkspace (version 3.2), an industrial robot
simulation software package, is a graphic simulation system and a means of
off-line programming a robot cell. The software package will create and simulate
robot programs in the native language of the robot. For example, users of Fanuc
robots may write robot programs in Karel, and ABB robot users may write robot
programs in ARLA. There is therefore no need for postprocessors to translate
from a simulation language to the robot language: the full power of the robot
language is available to the user through off-line programming.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="rt295-1.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">It is also possible to transfer existing robot
programs from the robot controller back into Workspace for optimization, so
off-line programming is a two-way process. This is facilitated by the use of
portable microcomputers which may be taken onto the factory floor and used next
to a robot workcell.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The user first selects the target
robot language required. To create a robot program, the user clicks the mouse on
robot commands on a pull-down menu. These commands are immediately written to an
ASCII text file. In this way, a robot program is created without the necessity
of typing the command words, though the user may also use a built-in text editor
if desired. As each command is written to the file, it is simulated graphically
on the computer screen in color 3D graphics.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Programs may be debugged by tracing
through line by line, seeing at each line what is happening in the simulation.
The value of variables may be watched or examined throughout. If an error occurs
at any point, then the user will immediately be placed in the Workspace text
editor at the position in the robot program where the error occurred, enabling
the error to be promptly corrected.
<BR> <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The full structure of the robot
languages is implemented, including typed variables, teachpoints, subroutines,
looping, branching on condition, signals, and condition handler interrupts.
<BR> <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Several robots working in
coordination, each under the control of a separate robot program, may be
simulated to produce one animation (<I>Figure 1</I>). During the simulation of
the robot program, any collisions that occur between any objects in the workcell
may be automatically reported, and a clock indicates the time taken for the
overall sequence of movements. The 3-D volume of the envelope may be plotted, or
2-D slices through the envelope displayed on the screen.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">All the main industrial and
educational robot languages are implemented, and a library of over 140 robot
models is available to the user (though it is also possible for users to create
their own robots).

Modeler</B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">3-D solid objects
(including combinations created using Constructive Solid Geometry) or surfaces
(including Bspline, Parametric, or Bezier surfaces) may be created using
Workspace's own 3-D CAD system or imported from an external CAD system using the
DXF file format (common among microcomputer-based CAD systems such as AutoCAD)
or the IGES file format (common among graphics-workstation-based CAD systems
such as CATIA). The use of an unlimited number of layers for storing different
levels of detail makes it possible to turn off the display of objects irrelevant
to the current task or display them in wireframe for speed.
<BR> <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The movement of any mechanism may
be modeled using a kinematics modeler. The mechanism may have any number of
joints in any serial or tree-structure combination. Conveyors, automatic guided
vehicles, and other independently moving objects may also be modeled.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>Defining Positions</B><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Positions and paths for the robot tool to
move to may be defined in several ways. A software emulation of a teach pendant
is available to move the robot either by stepping individual joint angles or by
stepping the XYZ Cartesian position of the tool relative to the robot world
coordinate frame. Positions may be saved as teachpoints for use later in a robot
program. These are displayed on the screen graphically as coordinate frames. If
the robot is placed in a different position in the workcell, then the
teachpoints will change color if they are no longer achievable due to the limits
on the joints of the robot or due to the limited reach of the robot.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Positions may also be defined by
clicking the mouse at different positions on the computer screen (changing the
view if necessary to define a 3-D position). Orientations may be defined in many
different ways-for example, by dragging the approach vector of the teachpoint
coordinate frame in a particular direction using the mouse.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>Geometry Points</B><BR><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The easiest, most powerful way of defining
robot positions is to use the geometry of objects. Points may be defined along
the seam between two surfaces in such a way that the position of the point on
the seam, the distance of the point from the seam, the lean of the approach
vector of the tool towards the seam, or the angle between the adjacent surfaces
and the tool approach vector is set by the user. This is of use in applications
such as arc welding.<BR> <IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Points may also
be defined normal to a surface so that the position on the surface and the
distance from the surface to the point is set by the user. As the point is moved
over the surface, the point is always maintained normal to the surface. This is
of use in applications such as spot welding, sealant dispensing, waterjet
cutting, buffing, polishing, and surface finishing.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Paths to follow a 2-D curve may be
defined automatically. Straight line and segments of the curve are translated
directly into linear and circular motions for the robot tool to follow. This is
of use in applications such as waterjet cutting.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>Calibration</B><BR><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Calibration is an important issue in off-line
programming and simulation, because the resulting robot program is only as
accurate as the model of the workcell. Workspace supports three types of
calibration.<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Calibration of the robot
tool involves finding the XYZ offset that must be added onto the kinematics of
the robot to account for the tool attached to the end of the robot. This uses a
procedure in which the robot and tool are moved repeatedly to a fixed location
and the resulting teachpoints taken from the robot controller back into
Workspace. A multivariable search technique is then used to calculate the tool
offset. This procedure may need to be repeated if the tool is knocked out of
alignment during use.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">A similar technique may be used to
find the true zero position of the robot. This is necessary since the zero
position of every joint of the robot is subject to drift during use. The
resulting offsets are used to produce a more accurate robot model than the
kinematics used on the robot controller itself.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Finally, the true position of
objects in the workcell may be measured using the robot as a measuring device,
and the resulting teachpoints taken back into Workspace and either used to
redefine vertices or else used to redefine known positions within the model.
Workspace can integrate with a mechanical calibration system- called Robotrak -
for measuring 3-D positions within the workcell independently of the robot.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>Replaying Simulations in Real Time</B><BR><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Simulations may be replayed within Workspace
in real time, but recent advances in animation technology enable even more
realistic playback. The simulations may be translated into the FLC file format
used by Autodesk Animator and replayed using a utility at speeds up to 50
frames/second. The resulting full-screen animations are very realistic, even on
a medium-range 486 color notebook, that it is like looking through a window onto
the factory floor. The utility for replaying FLC files will be bundled with the
Workspace software.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>Simulation of
Dynamics</B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">It's possible to
simulate the dynamics of a robot using Workspace for a defined sequence of
movements. The equations relating the torques and accelerations at each joint
and their interactions for a six-axis robot are modeled using numerical
integration. Two type of controller equation may be used: classical and
discrete-time control. The constant multipliers in the controller equations may
be modified and the resulting effect on the trajectory examined. The effect of
attaching a payload to the end of the robot may also be examined. However, until
it is possible to obtain accurate estimates for the mass, inertia matrices,
center of gravity, and controller constants at each joint, dynamics simulation
is only of use in demonstrating general principles and obtaining qualitative,
not quantitative, information.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><B>The Future</B><BR><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">For many years, robot companies have not been
cooperative in providing the information required to accurately simulate the
paths generated by the robot controller when moving through via points. Without
this information it is difficult for a simulation to provide precise
cycle-times. Now, large automotive robot users, have fully committed themselves
irrevocably to off-line programming, are beginning to make it a condition of
future robot orders that this information is provided as a black box to the
simulation companies.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">However, simulation and off-line
programming will only become widely accepted if there is a change in attitude
within the simulation companies, who at present seem unwilling to get involved
on the factory floor. Simulation is often carried out on the other side of the
factory, or in some cases on the other side of the country. The resulting
programs are then taken down onto the factory floor  This is where the problems
for the people on the factory floor begin. Reality is seldom the same as a
simulation, and the robot programs usually require modification, but by this
time the simulation is being used on the next project.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">This gap between the factory floor
and the simulation is one that Workspace is designed to close by letting a
portable microcomputer to be taken down to the factory floor and the simulation
to be used next to the robot controller, and by letting robot programs to be
shuffled backwards and forwards between the simulation and the robot controller
as many times as required.</P></TD></TR>

<TABLE WIDTH="500"><TR><TD COLSTART="1"><P><IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="w2.gif" ALT="W">hen I first met Walt Weisel, nearly 20 years
ago, he was working with robotic equipment (he's been with major robot
companies, including Unimation and Prab). That equipment was programmed through
a hand-held device that an operator used to move the arm to the required
locations, then to enter the points in space. Generally, it would be a matter of
programming a robot to perform spot welding of automotive bodies-in-white, which
was certainly a burgeoning application in the early days. It was a matter of
moving the arm, making sure it was at the right location, adjusting if
necessary, entering the point, moving to the next position, and so on.<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">One major downside of this approach, of
course, Is that the equipment was tied up for a long time for setup, which
wasn't beneficial from the standpoint of providing a return on what was then
perceived to be a somewhat risky investment. Programming is essential for
production, but there's no production going on during programming.<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="prod295.gif" ALT="workcell" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10"><BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">If there were changes-say the door aperture
was modified-then it was back to this manual programming approach. (Editing
wasn't then what it is now, so it was often tedium upon tedium.)<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">A significant change came when off-line
programming was developed for robotic systems. With this change, people could
view not merely the image of a single robot and the workpiece on a CRT, but an
entire system, including the peripherals. This allows programming to be
performed -while or even before-equipment was on order or while it was operating
in existing applications. Which takes care of that payback tie-up to a degree.<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">However, Walt Weisel, who is now the president
&amp; CEO of International Business Link (Ft. Myers Beach, FL), which has
recently formed a new company called Robotic Workspace Technologies, maintains
that off-line robotic programming isn't all that it is cracked up to be, and
that the manual programming approach, while not as extensive, still remains a
necessary activity. &quot;If an off-line program is able to get the arm to a
position within 1/4-in,&quot; Weisel maintains, &quot;it is phenomenally close.
He explains that what is the ordinary course of affairs includes manually
tweaking the program after it has been developed. For one thing, he says, not
all robotic arms have the same characteristics and kinematics - even robots of
the same brand, same model. In addition, locating things on the floor is a whole
lot different from locating them on a computer screen. These differences must be
dealt with in real life, which turns into real money: Weisel estimates as much
as $55,000 per workstation. Which binds up the payback potential, to a degree,
once again.<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">So he has identified a
problem. What's his solution?<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">It's a
PC-based off-line programming package named &quot;Workspace 3&quot; that, Weisel
maintains, can generate the robot program in a background mode while the
simulation is being created; this program is being developed in the robot's own
language, be it Karel, ARLA, VAL, or others. The simulation is in 3D and in
color, and, Weisel admits, isn't as attractive as the screens generated by the
more full-blown robotic simulation packages-then he points out the price for
Workspace is S26,000.<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Weisel is not
trying to supplant the bigger simulation vendors. Rather, he maintains that what
happens is what the workstation-based simulation packages are used to create
off-line programs that are then passed down to the plant level; the people who
created them then move on to the next simulation project, leaving the plant
people to tweak the program. He says Workspace is a tool for the people in the
plant who need to get the robots to work as needed.
<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">As for the knowing precisely where
the robot is in space: There is an option called Robotrak, which consists of a
robot end-effector interface; an ISA interface card; a reference bar; the
Workspace software with the calibration option; and encoders. The encoders use a
non-stretch Dacron cord. The encoders are located; locations are established;
and then the cords are attached to the end effector. As the arm moves through
space, the robot is calibrated to within 0.008 in., according to Weisel.-GSV

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Walter K. Weisel</P> 
<TABLE><TR><TD COLSTART="1" WIDTH="400"><P>When I became one of the
industry's handful of robotics originator's twenty-five years ago, we made a
bold but correct assumption.  We believed companies that did not introduce
robotics into their manufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edge
they held, and would lose the major benefits robots offered to manufacturers in
improved productivity, higher quality products, and reduced time.  We were
right. Today, however, after nearly three decades of living with the
limitations, the robotics industry is taking advantage of a new revolution:
PC-based simulation.  Software that combines off-line calibration of robot and
workcell has catapulted robotics into the fast lane worldwide.</P><P>The
software development of WORKSPACE began on a PC platform in the late 1980's. 
The premiss was that Pcs would have the ability to become faster, cheaper and
contain more memory.  Developers predicted that Pcs capabilities in the future
would bring them to the level at which Silicon Graphics computers are today. 
Even the most daring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potential
of PC-based simulation software.  No-one thought of robotic simulations being
sent for analysis around the world via e-mail and the Internet-but it is being
done.  Receivers need a personal computer with Microsoft Windows - period; the
WORKSPACE program is not required to view the simulation.</P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396a.gif" BORDER="1" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="225"><P>Manufactures
are focusing attention on these software developments  The stakes are much
higher than 25 or 30 years ago for manufacturers who assume the &quot;wait and
see&quot; posture.  The industry's newest simulation program operates on a PC,
even a notebook computer.  It combines robotic workcell simulation, offline
programming and online calibration in a single, seamless piece of software; and
it works.  Suddenly, a robot manufacturer, systems integrator or robot user can
define a part and a production system for a finished product by using full
digital representation, whereas before we relied on drawings and analog-based
information.  Marketed in North America under the name WORKSPACE, the PC-based
software addresses and resolves all the challenges that simulation and offline
programming  have posed over the decades, and does it for substantially less
cost that the traditional mainframe and engineering workstations.  Most
importantly, we can now determine in simulation whether a job can or cannot be
done before we ever put one penny or pound into the hardware.  In essence, a
user can &quot;test drive&quot; the applications in software.</P><P>I predict 
that this new approach to simulation, using a standard PC,  will provide a
universal solution to universal solution to universal problems that can now be
transmitted over universal networks.  It is changing the way we do business
internationally - now.  If you are not already a user, you are in the process of
losing your competitive edge even as you read this article.</P><P><B>Old
problems/new solutions</B></P><P>Several  key problems- barriers - have kept
robotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robot and workcell
calibration from reaching full potential.  Today, those barriers are gone; wiped
out- Demolished by this new PC-based approach.  The state of the art for
simulation is altered.  For example, one of the greatest challenges has been to
devise a way to send a program to a robot, a program that makes the robot
perform flawlessly without human intervention.  Historically, we have demanded
inexpensive robot  hardware, then assumed the self-limiting posture that it is
perfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and &quot;teach it&quot;  points &quot;
by hand&quot;.  I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendent must
not be an acceptable way of life.  It's been an industry constant because  up to
now, we did not know how  the real robot on the floor looks and acts in
comparison to how the &quot;perfect&quot; robot in simulation-software looks and
acts.  It did not matter that we copied the manufacturer's specifications
exactly. The mechanical model always has something that does not match the
specified data.  Robots have always been manufactured to be repeatable, not
accurate.</P><IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396b.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="196"><P>The
new generation of PC-based simulation software solves that problem.  A special
set of precision instruments ( ROBOTRAK) traces or reads each of the robot's
actual kinematics (individual signature), including variances created from the
way robots are manufactured, installed and maintained.  The WORKSPACE simulation
software,  called Calibration, then compares the robot's taught positions to the
achieved positions in space.  A new set of actual robot kinematics is generated
within WORKSPACE, and this is the  simulation in place of the perfect model.  It
is at this point that reach, collision and cycle rates may be more accurately
predicted.  The system quick, accurate, and inexpensive.  Once the actual robot
is signature, it can be used on its own to calibrate other peripherals in the
workcell.</P><P>Price/performance has always been a major barrier.  The old
method required a non-portable computer system to operate the software.  Total
costs are US$110,000.  These systems have failed to perform successfully offline
programming functions, since they do not take into account the actual robot
kinematics is left up to the others, at substantially higher costs.</P><P>The
PC-based simulation system is portable, fast, accurate, does offline
programming, online calibrations and  can interface with precision measuring
equipment to track a robot's motions and provide an actual signature that is
then used in the simulation.  It also smashes the price/performance barrier.</P><P><B>North
America awakening to simulation benefits</B></P><P>Simulation's costs benefits
and time saving have industry members looking for the fine print; the down side.
 There is none.  Simulation is the robotics industry breakthrough for which
users have been waiting , and it has already started to change the fabric of
North American manufacturing.  Even companies receiving proposals and products
from suppliers are now insisting on vendor simulations to be provided with their
proposals.  This forces a complete analysis of a process down the line to the
component level.</P><P>Statistical analysis in simulation, also part of the
WORKSPACE software,  mean that we can provide predictions of overall production
on an annual basis.  Once users have created the simulation, he or she can
analyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment in a workcell. They can also
project pieces per hour, as week as uptime/downtime factors.  WORKSPACE contains
an option called &quot;throughput&quot;, which analyses parts per hour, downtime
and problem areas for improvement.</P><P>Simulation now can be used to layout
the entire manufacturing process, from concept to finished product.  A user now
has the ability to &quot;test drive&quot; a system at all levels of the process
before committing hardware.</P><P>Simulations can be transmitted worldwide for
analysis via e-mail of Internet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales,
engineering, manufacturing advantage. The person reviewing the simulation need
to use WORKSPACE; this is a major breakthrough.  This unique feature provides
the ultimate tool for concurrent engineering.</P><P>Simulation, formerly
regarded as an engineering function, now becomes an affordable vendor tool to
show prospective buyers that the system works, and the vendor has done the
necessary homework.  Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costly
crashes and downtime.</P><P>Simulation is not in anyway restricted to robots. 
It is an outstanding tool to evaluate process lines, stamping lines, everything
up to and including indexing transfer lines and transfer mechanisms.</P><P><B>Actual
uses of PC-based simulation</B></P><P>In addition to traditional uses of
simulating new processes, WORKSPACE  allows a user to reverse engineer or edit
existing applications.  The PC-based simulation system takes in the actual
program that runs a robot, them simulates the robot's activities on the screen
while the operator analyses the robots program.  The user then edits the reach
points within WORKSPACE to improve the robot's program, all while the actual
robot continues in production.  WORKSPACE then creates a new corrected/edited
program in the robot's language- the ultimate editing tool.</P><P>In recent
simulation analysis of existing robot programs, we were able to take from two to
six seconds out of robot cycle times by editing their previously taught points. 
Individual companies will have to assign their own values to what it means to
take from two to six seconds out of robot cycle times by editing their
previously taught points.  Individual companies will have to assign their own
values to what it means to take a couple of seconds out of a part's cycle time. 
A company that makes 100,000 parts a year in a robotic cell can recover a
significant amount of production time and money.</P><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="ir396c.gif" BORDER="1" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="221"><P>The
WORKSPACE simulation software also compensates for robot add ons, such as a
junction box, cables and brackets.  These engineering changes often mean the
robot no longer fits into its work envelope as per the original simulation. 
Since WORKSPACE can travel with the job, a user can resimulate where necessary. 
WORKSPACE then reprograms the robot to eliminate costly start-up
surprises-collision points, near misses, and points the robot can no longer
reach because of the additional constraints.</P><P>As example for robot
calibration is: a manufacturer using simulation assumes that the robot used in
the simulation assumes that the robot used in the simulation is the same as the
robot to be used introduction.  this is rarely, if ever, the case.  Let us
assume that the robot ordered can reach exactly two metres.  But constraints in
the reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in every
robot.  The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach two metres,
it may fall 20-30 millimeters short. Unless a calibrated robot model is used in
the simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work.  This
decades-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocate
parts of the system.  WORKSPACE locates the problem before the machines are
bolted down, reverifies at the time of installation and assists in correcting
any remaining problems.</P><P>In another example, simulation was used as a &quot;repair&quot;
job where interfering with each other in the workcell.  The system had been laid
out using a simulation system which was on a Silicon Graphics workstation in
another city.  That simulation did not travel with the job to finish that
installation.  By having the WORKSPACE simulation on a 486 notebook, corrections
were analyzed at the job site and corrections made.</P><P><B>Predictions</B></P><P>Anyone
who has knowledge of  PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn't
need to ask, &quot;What's on the horizon?&quot;  But I love it when they ask
anyway.  My predictions for the industry include the following:</P><UL>
<LI>Best estimates suggest the size of the North American simulation market
today is between $30 and $35 million. I have no doubt that in the next couple of
years, the market will have surged to over $100 million, and the crest of the
wave is not even in sight.</LI>
<LI>Within the next two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry of
PC-based open architecture controls.  They will replace today's specialized
controls which require specialized interfaces.  I believe that leading PC
simulation software packages will plug and play on most-if not all- of those PC
controllers.</LI>
<LI>We will  see- and demand- PC-based, resident simulation in engineering at
vendor facilities builders' shops and at production facilities.</LI>
<LI>Simulation will be neutral to the robot and specific to the application.
Systems integrators and robot users will demand objective analyses of the entire
range of robot manufacturing. Robot manufacturers,  therefore,  will not be in
the field of objective simulation analysis of robotic systems.</LI>
<LI>Factories with robots from different manufacturers will increasingly rely
on simulation,  and demand services from companies which do not have ties to
robot or supplier companies.  Users will insist on an objective evaluation of
robot function and system performance  for a wide range of manufacturers
products.</LI>
<LI>PC-based simulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers and
users, and the transition is underway.</LI></UL><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>Robot
Simulation, Ltd., the UK's research and development team which selected the
personal computer for simulation software development, broke out of the
mainframe mindset that crippled progress for years.  What they created - a
portable,  PC-based, robotic simulation  program with offline programming and
online robot calibration capabilities- means every robotics manufacturer,
systems integrator and robot user can have access to an affordable and effective
tool for increasing production profits.  Simulations created using WORKSPACE on
a personal computer can be sent by e-mail and via the Internet to anyone
anywhere in the world, who is using  a PC with Microsoft Windows.  WORKSPACE
simulation analysis  is not site specific, and the ability to transmit
simulation freely to virtually anyone opens the door to unobstructed
international resources.</P><P>I believe,  without hesitation or doubt, that
PC-based simulation technology is the sleeping giant of the 1990's.  And the
giant has just yawned.</P><P></P><HR NOSHADE="NOSHADE"><P><B>Walter K.
Weisel</B> is President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies Inc., of Fort
Myers Beach, Florida, USA, supplying software, electronics and hardware. In

Florida-based RWT.  &quot;The sheer size and importance of the Canadian market
dictated that we choose a firm with outstanding technical expertise backed by
strong management experience.  We found both and more in CIS.&quot;</P>
<P> CIS, an international robotics integration and systems simulation source,
provides a full range of automation services, from robotic application
engineering and support for start-up and development to simulation and robot
programming services.  CIS provides robotic signature services in the users'
facilities; the company also has laboratory facilities to demonstrate the
accuracy, quality and productivity increases offered by WORKSPACE products.  As
an added bonus, CIS personnel are multi-skilled, so site expenditures are
typically lower.</P>
<P> Mark Bevins, President and CEO of CIS said, &quot;We now have the ability
to prove out the feasibility of robotic workcells before we commit to hardware,
something the industry has needed for years.&quot;  In addition, the WORKSPACE
simulation system allows CIS to assure their customers of decreased time and
reduced labor costs when they launch robots.</P>
<P> CIS serves a host of major manufacturers in the automotive industry,
including Chrysler (Canada and U.S.), Ford (Canada and U.S.), and General Motors
(Canada and U.S.).</P>
<P>
WORKSPACE is a revolutionary simulation software system that:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>runs on a personal computer (PC), including a notebook;
</LI>
<LI>provides 3D graphical simulation of any existing or proposed robotic
system;</LI>
<LI>combines robotic workcell simulation, off-line programming and on-line
calibration in one seamless piece of software.</LI></UL>
<P>&quot;CIS concentrates its work in the industrial robotic simulation and
robot programming support business,&quot; said Weisel.  &quot;The firm's
existing relationships with North American heavy-equipment installers coupled

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">E-mail Delivers Computer-to-Computer Simulation for
Concurrent Review and Analysis</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Engineers, Marketers and Manufacturers See Simultaneous
Views From Different Parts of the Country and World</H2>
<P><B>Fort Myers, FL</B> (March 25, 1996): WORKSPACE&#174;, the revolutionary
simulation software that runs on a personal computer - including notebooks, has
added another first to its expanding list of cost-effective features. A
Workspace user who has engineered a robotics or automated system can transmit -
via e-mail, modem or Internet - a complete simulation file to any computer that
uses Microsoft Windows. Only the originator of the simulation must have
Workspace.</P>
<P> &quot;This new capability has created the ultimate engineering, marketing
and manufacturing tool,&quot; says Walter K. Weisel, CEO of Robotic Workspace
Technologies, Inc., exclusive North American marketers of Workspace. &quot;Now
each person on the team can view a simulation in real time, confer by conference
call, make engineering decisions and marketing decisions all at the same time
without ever leaving their individual offices. All that's required is a PC with
Microsoft Windows and a phone to talk with each other.&quot; </P>
<P>The PC-generated simulation to be transmitted (called a &quot;Flick File&quot;)
contains a full-shaded color, 3D simulation, which runs all the peripherals,
including robots in real time. Before sending the file, the Workspace user
converts the simulation being run on the PC into a real time picture file. </P>
<P>This computer file is then sent via e-mail, Internet, or on a 3.5 floppy to
as many worldwide locations as necessary.</P>
<P> During the conference call, all parties watch the same simulation in their
own offices, and discuss and approve proposals, engineering changes, and floor
layouts. Changes can be made quickly in software to verify any new requirements.
 &quot;Before now, the only way to evaluate a workcell or other system was to
coordinate schedules and meet at one location,&quot; Weisel says. &quot;Concurrency
through electronic mail means there's no lost time from the calendar, no flying
in from around the country or around the world, and incalculable time saved in
getting a system up and running. The Workspace software allows everyone to test
drive the application before ordering the hardware.</P>
<P>&quot;Smart buyers around the world are becoming keenly aware of the need to
simulate a system's capabilities before  purchasing expensive hardware,&quot;
Weisel adds. &quot;The power of today's PC makes this job easy and the
portability - both via electronic mail or operating on a notebook - changes the
way we think about proof of concept.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><H1><B>Use of Simulation prevents costly mistakes prior to build-up</B></H1></P>

<P><B>Fort Myers Beach, FL</B> (September 11, 1996): Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, relates how a recent customer saved hundreds of man hours and capital expenditure as a result of the use of simulation in robot cell layout.</P>
<P>"We were really an afterthought to the customers project plans for a large computer supplier." states Walt Weisel, President and CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc.(RWT). RWT is the exclusive North American distributor of Workspace&reg;, the world's first PC based robot simulation and off-line programming software package developed by Robotic Simulations, Ltd. of the UK. "The integrator gave us the project to model as a challenge to evaluate Workspace&reg;. Using their 2D CAD drawings and rough layout plans, we modeled the cell in Workspace&reg; and created a 3D animation that told them more than they were expecting to find. They had already purchased the robot and were building enclosures based on the 2D drawings and rough modeling in their shop. Which is a fairly standard practice in the industry for companies not using simulation."</P>

<p>One of the first comments we got from their design team was that we were asking them questions about components of the cell they normally would not have researched until they were in the final phases of  build-up. So not only did we create a proactive approach to the design and layout, we later discovered several things that would have cost thousands more than the initial purchase of the software. We met with the customer at their facility with the robot setting in the back room awaiting the cell build-up.</p>

<p>"The first thing we proved through the simulation was the robot could not reach all of the fixtures it needed to. In a 2D CAD drawing it looked feasible, but when you add in the true reach of the robot model, they were coming up short. This was coupled with major collisions in the cycle that would have destroyed the fixtures and the controller monitor. They had also realized the cycle time shown in simulation was 30 seconds over contract time. Even under perfect cycle simulations, they were not going to make their goal and the goal their customer was expecting under contract. All in all, they would have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars including their reputation."</p>

<p>"With the simulation in hand, they were able to quickly redesign the cell, reposition the robot, change fixtures and redevelop the entire process with the customer to achieve cycle times and actually exceed the customer's expectations. The ability of Workspace&reg; to run on their notebook computer and they could easily take the simulation right to the customers desk, allowed them to graphically show the story and sell the customer without lengthy delays while they deciphered drawings and made their own calculations. They were also able to leave a copy of the simulation for the customer to run on their own PC, using the animation player feature of Workspace&reg;, the customer only needed to have a PC running Windows 3.11."</p>

<p>"This is just one of the success stories we have shared with customers and Workspace&reg;." adds Walt. We
 have such an affordable alternative to the expensive UNIX- based systems that do not have the portability and versatility this program has to offer. For off-line programming, this system is without comparison in it's seamless, native language code writing for over 174 models of robots using 22 different languages. We also have connectivity capabilities only available with a PC based system. We are bringing true, open-architecture to robot users who have been held hostage to antiquated technology."</p>

<h1><b>Today is the tomorrow you dreamed of yesterday!</b></h1><br>
<p align="CENTER">Off-line, robot programming is possible with the new 
"intelligent" software options</p>

<p><b>Fort Myers Beach, FL</b> (September 6, 1996): For the past twenty -five years, the robotics industry has dreamed and worked to find the solution to robot accuracy. Repeatability has been perfected with robot manufacturers concentrating on the hardware of the robot. Now that we have achieved this level of repeatability we want accuracy. Will it come from hardware innovations or follow in the footsteps of the other leading edge technology, from intelligent software solutions.</p>

<p>A technology company in Fort Myers Beach, FL has combined the knowledge of a 25 yr. Founder of the industry and an inexpensive software program to achieve what everyone thinks is impossible. Robotic Workspace Technologies, Inc., has proven at multiple sites that robot accuracy is not only attainable but is also affordable. Using the Robotrak and Workspace software package, they have achieved results that no robot manufacturer would begin to offer a user. Their customers have improved inaccuracies from 22mm to .9mm and subsequently saved millions of dollars in the first year.</p> 

<p>The piece to the puzzle that has been neglected is in the "brain" of the robot; the software that controls it. Robot manufacturers and third party software vendors have either walked away or have avoided following in the same directions as other technology markets. The PC revolution would have stalled 10 years ago if they had relied on hardware innovations to fuel the advancements in computer technology. It was the software development companies that have created more intelligent programs that have conversely solved many of the hardware limitations.</p> 

<p>The technology is available today that will allow you to go beyond mastering your robot and allow you to "signature" each robot. By defining the robot's manufactured discrepancies, each robot can be calibrated in off-line programming to achieve accuracy at the tool tip.
It is these robot discrepancies that have plagued robot, off-line programming innovators to state that it is "just not possible."</p>

<p>Robotrak&reg; and Workspace&reg; are the cost effective solutions to off-line programming through actual native language programming of your production floor robot. With these two, PC based applications, you can get each individual robots signature and then utilize the kinematics of each robot as you generate the off-line program.
</p>

<p>Robotrak&reg; is the robot calibration and signature tool that utilizes a series of calibration moves to provide Workspace, an off-line and simulation software package, with the measurements of difference in the robot components. Through the use of Robotrak, you can generate a true signature of the robot that is then utilized in the calculation of the robot program through Workspace&reg;. It is this measurement of robot arm positioning that permits Workspace&reg; to effectively and accurately off-line program the robot controller.
</p>

<p>Once the signature is determined, about a 30 minute operation, the differentiation in the kinematics is applied to the robot arm positioning algorithm. This imported data becomes a true simulation of the robot on the production floor. Now when Workspace&reg; creates the simulation using your imported, 3D CAD part, you are actually programming the exact robot you have on the floor to the exact part you are manufacturing. Now off-line programming with accuracy is achievable.
</p>

<p>Workspace&reg; does not utilize language translators but instead uses interpreters that allow you to program in native language just like a teach pendant would. This eliminates the problems associated with other third party programs that program in a proprietary language and rely on post processors to translate the language into something the robot controller can understand.</p> 

<p>"We recently received a request from an automotive OEM supplier who was looking for a way to reduce robot programming downtime and to improve tolerances to under 3 mm," said Walt Weisel, CEO of Robotic Workspace Technologies, the exclusive North American dealer of Robotrak and Workspace. "They were losing over $17,000 per month in downtime charged to reprogramming robots. In addition, the lost production at $12.00 per part, per minute created an additional loss of $204,000. Within a 1.5 hour process with Robotrak and Workspace, we were able to take the part tolerance to within .9 mm of accuracy and cut the programming time down to under one hour. An hourly programming savings of over 6 hours on just one of their 30 robots. A high ranking official was so astonished when he added up all of the savings, that he is implementing a 200 plant task force to implement the technology. The total annual savings could, conservatively, exceed $200 million dollars in the first year."
</p>

<p>To walk away from off-line programming or to settle for the results you are getting is a shame. There is a better answer to achieve substantial savings and to reduce downtime production losses due to teach pendant programming and minimally successful off-line programming.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PC-Based Robotic Simulation Smashes Price/Performance
Barrier</H1>
<P><B> Fort Myers , FL</B> (November 10, 1995):  A new, sophisticated robotic
simulation software system that runs on a personal computer (PC) has demolished
the barrier that separated simulation economy and performance.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE&#174;, offered by Florida-based Robotic Workspace Technologies
(RWT), Inc., is the world's first PC-based program that creates real-time
simulation of robotic workcells with its own 3D CAD system.  It also provides
effective off-line programming and on-line calibration of individual robots
using seamless software on a single PC or notebook. There are over 700 systems
installed worldwide.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE costs a small fraction - less than 1/3 - of engineering
workstation systems in use today.  A few of the features and cost savings are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>complete 3D simulation of entire workcells on a PC, including notebooks;
</LI>
<LI>direct CAD input (DXF, IGES):</LI>
<LI>off-line programming in the robot's native language without interrupting
robot operation;</LI>
<LI>on-line robot and workcell calibration;</LI>
<LI>new-program development time reduced;</LI>
<LI>design-before-you-build allows costly errors to be corrected before they
become hardware;</LI>
<LI>on-line robot program editing and verification </LI>
</UL>
<P>WORKSPACE saves time, delivers greater accuracy, and is easier to use than
mainframe and engineering workstation systems.  The system's purchase price is
under $28,000.  WORKSPACE may also be rented or leased, an ideal route to
improved productivity today when the budget says wait.</P>
<P> WORKSPACE was developed for the PC platform in the late 1980's by Robot
Simulations, Ltd. (United Kingdom) and is now offered exclusively by Robotic
Workspace Technologies, Inc., 17105 San Carlos Boulevard, Suite A6151, Fort
Myers Beach, Florida, 33931; (941) 466-0488; FAX (941) 466-7270.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PC-Based Robotic Simulation Software Available to Rent or
Lease</H1>
<P><B>Fort Myers , FL</B> (November 10, 1995):  WORKSPACE&#174;, the
revolutionary robot simulation software that runs on a personal computer (PC),
including notebooks, is now available to rent or lease.  That means the already
low-priced software can be installed immediately by manufacturers who thought
they had to wait for another budget cycle.</P>
<P>Robotic Workspace Technologies (RWT), Inc., exclusive North American
marketers of WORKSPACE, recently added the rent and lease options, said CEO
Walter K. Weisel.  &quot;For an average of $1,500 a month, a manufacturer can
lease this highly sophisticated software that creates and simulates robotic
workcells and other production processes with its own 3D CAD system.&quot;  The
lease fee converts to $8-10 an hour for a single shift, and less than $5 an hour
for a double shift.</P>
<P>WORKSPACE features include simulation, a 3D CAD modeler, off-line
programming in the robot's native language, and on-line robot and workcell
calibration.  &quot;For the first time, manufacturers have the ability to prove
out the feasibility of robotic workcells before they commit to hardware,&quot;
Weisel said.</P>
<P>In addition to the lease program, which can be converted to a purchase at
any time, RWT rents WORKSPACE for individual simulation projects.  RWT also
provides support to get new users up and running, and a three-day training
period is included in the lease fee.</P>
<P>&quot;There are many advantages to the rent/lease opportunities,&quot;
Weisel said.  &quot;Two are critical.  First, a manufacturer who cannot
authorize a $28,000 capital investment to buy the system today can lease now
rather than wait to convert to this cost- and time-saving system in six months,
a year or more.  Second, there are still some who just can't believe how
accurate and easy it is to operate WORKSPACE.  They now have a chance to work
with the PC-based simulation software before they decide to install the system
permanently.&quot;</P>

<P>Dear Reader,</P>

<P>It is my honour to be the Chairman of CONCAWE at a time of great challenge.
Environment, health and safety issues continue to rise on the agendas of
governments, non-government and industrial organizations alike. Furthermore,
the manufacture, distribution and consumption of petroleum products is
receiving ever-increasing attention, not least from the public at large.
</P>

<P>Air quality in particular is under the regulatory spotlight, not only
because of the European Auto/Oil Programme, the first phase of which reached
a conclusion in June, but also as a result of other legislative procedures,
e.g. the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), the Air Quality
Framework Directive (AQFD) and the possibility of further directives relating
to fuels and vehicle emissions.</P>

<P>The need for the oil industry to understand and address such issues
effectively means a growth in demand for CONCAWEs expertise. This need,
however, comes at a time when the industry continues to face problems of
profitability and consequential staff and budget cutbacks. The problem
is compounded by the trend towards increasing specialization. </P>

<P>The reason that CONCAWE was founded (more than 33 years ago), i.e. to
pool limited resources to study environment, health, and safety issues
of mutual interest, makes even more sense now. The efficient use of these
resources will be one of my main priorities as Chairman.</P>

<P>I will ensure that the Management Groups and the CONCAWE Secretariat
continue to work closely together. Collectively, we will maintain an ongoing
dialogue within the industry to ensure that we have a good understanding
of upcoming issues and priorities. In this way, we will be able to undertake
appropriate technical programmes to form the basis of sound decision-making
in a timely manner.</P>

<P>It is also my intention to ensure that CONCAWE maintains its reputation
for technical excellence, even-handedness and openness. We will continue
to provide advice, guidance and data for the European legislative decision-making
process, based on sound-science and costeffectiveness principles, in a
way which will continue to provide excellent value for money. </P>

<P>We will be working hard to improve communications and networking between
CONCAWEs member companies, particularly through better use of electronic
media. Recognizing also the ongoing need to demonstrate the value of CONCAWEs
activities, and to publicise the results of our work, we will be assessing
the use of other options, such as newsletters, information meetings, and
issues briefings, in addition to the traditional medium of the CONCAWE
Review. We will also be following with interest the response to our Internet
Home Page which was opened recently. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Illupc.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=208 WIDTH=308 ALIGN=RIGHT>The
engine behind the CONCAWE reputation as a tell it as it is organization
is the stream of high quality technical studies which, since inception
in 1963, CONCAWE has been reporting into the public domain. As time has
passed, the questions being addressed have become much more complex, more
to do with economics and more interactive with other issues. Studies were,
therefore, taking longer to complete. Each study group had to establish
its own basis and boundaries whilst working simultaneously but independently
of each other. The reconciliation of results was becoming bedevilled by
apparent anomalies in the basic data and planning assumptions employed.
In the late eighties, CONCAWEs Refining Planning Advisory Group (RPAG)
was formed to establish a structure for carrying out industry-wide refining
studies and to provide the computing tools to do the job.</P>

<P>At the core of the toolmaking was the CONCAWE Linear Programming (LP)
model; the foundation of the structure was the establishment of a planning
cycle to provide a planning basis and to update it when necessary. The
first CONCAWE planning cycle was carried out in 1994 and was made available
(CONCAWE document no. 95/02) on request to anyone in the business of doing
refinery studies. The structure has proved to be invaluable in carrying
out the many refining studies required for the European Auto/Oil Programme,
and for others such as the disposal options for used lubricating oils.</P>

<P>At the heart of any planning basis is an oil product demand forecast.
CONCAWE has not tried to set itself up in the crystal ball forecasting
department but uses the Directorate General for Energy (DG-XVII) view of
the future. This forms a major element in determining the effects of initiatives
which can arise in any of the European legislative bodies. DG-XVII has
recently published its views in European Energy to 2020. The CONCAWE
RPAG has analysed these views in the context of its own thinking on the
supply side of the equation, such as crude slate developments and future
refinery processing economics trends. The results of this analysis have
been reviewed by a number of independent consultants having an acknowledged

<P>Urban air quality is one of the most widely discussed of all the environmental
issues. It has grabbed the attention of the media, public, legislators
and politicians. The European Auto/Oil Programme carried out by the European
Commission and the auto and oil industries, aimed to introduce measures
to meet stringent air quality targets across Europe with particular emphasis
on large metropolitan areas. This article concentrates on the implications
of the Auto/Oil Programme for urban air quality across Europe and is followed
by one on regional <A HREF="Ozone1.htm">ozone</A> and another on the <A HREF="Proposal.htm">emission
control</A> proposals.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Table1-1.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=115 WIDTH=310 ALIGN=LEFT>Seven
cities with existing emission inventories and air quality data were chosen
as representative for Europe in terms of their air quality, size, location,

and Milano.</P>

<P>The review of air quality from 1980 onward examined a range of pollutants
including: benzene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, particulate
matter, and total hydrocarbons. It concluded that, in general, one or more
European Union air quality limit values or WHO air quality guidelines have
been exceeded on occasion in all of the cities studied. </P>

<P>Target values were selected for modelling purposes in the Auto/Oil Programme
as agreed EU air quality objectives (AQOs) are not yet available. The basis
for these reference values was a pragmatic one. Guidance for their setting
was gained from guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (See
<A HREF="Health.htm">Health Effects of Nitrogen Oxides</A>) and by reference
to other standards or guidelines in EU Member States which are generally
more exacting than in the USA. </P>

<P>Internationally recognized and tested air quality models were used to
establish the relationships between emissions and air quality. Three pollutants-nitrogen
oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and benzene-were predicted for the base
year 1990. Three different 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric dispersion models
were used to ensure that any prediction was robust and not due to the choice
of model. For each of the seven cities, a 100 km x 100 km area including
the city and its surroundings was examined at a resolution of 2 km x 2
km. In addition, two types of meteorological conditions were examined,
one that would represent average conditions and one that would be typical
for the production of an episode of particularly poor urban air quality.</P>

<P>Air quality models considered emissions from: passenger cars (gasoline
and diesel); two-wheeled vehicles; buses; light-duty and heavy-duty commercial
vehicles; and large-, medium- and small-size stationary sources.</P>

<P>Source-receptor relationships were established and the contributions
to air pollution from each of the various source categories determined
for each 2 km x 2 km square in each city. Figure 1a shows the 1990 base
case annual mean NOx concentrations for London, and Figures 1b and 1c show
how these decrease by 2010 for two cases. If European cities are ranked
in terms of their overall air quality, approximately 80 per cent of them
have better air quality than London. The yellow areas show where the annual
mean NOx air quality target of 66 &#181;g/m3* is exceeded.</P>

<P>The previous article was about urban air pollution. Elevated concentrations
of ozone, however, are found in both rural and urban locations. This article
on ozone moves away from urban to regional air quality. It highlights the
effect of the Auto/Oil Programme proposed measures on ozone formation across
Europe.</P>

<P>Ozone is considered a pollutant in the lower atmosphere because, above
certain concentrations, it can cause respiratory irritancy, adverse effects
on breathing and damage to plants. However, in the stratosphere, ozone
forms a protective layer absorbing potentially-damaging ultra-violet light
before it reaches the Earth's surface.</P>

<P>In the lower atmosphere, ozone is formed through complex reactions involving
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aided by sunlight.
Ozone concentrations are linked to the relative proportions of VOC and
NOx concentrations, weather conditions and topography. Sources of VOCs
and NOx are both man-made and natural. In 1990, road vehicles contributed
36 per cent of man-made VOC emissions and 51 per cent of NOx emissions.</P>

Pollution in Europe. It takes into account the reactions of the various
chemicals that together lead to the formation of lower atmosphere ozone,
and predicts ozone air quality on the basis of emissions data for 50 km
by 50 km grid squares. The data on the effects of measures are presented

<P>The model's 1-hour ozone predictions for 1990 (Figure 1a) fit well with
available measurement data, although EMEP's highest 1-hour predictions

ozone on a regional scale but does not predict urban concentrations. All
of the Figures are based on European Commission data, available on CD-ROM.</P>

urban air quality) were centred primarily in Northern Europe, with the
peak concentrations of those exceedances centred around the Benelux region.
Given this current situation, the Auto/Oil Programme, through EMEP, has
attempted to determine the effect of already-agreed environmental controls
on future air quality, and what more needs to be done to meet ozone air
quality targets in Europe.</P>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>During the three years of very hard work in the Auto/Oil Programme an
EU strategy has been developed to deliver the least-cost measures to meet
the agreed reference air quality values on the five pollutants of concern.
On 18th June, the European Commission adopted two of the legislative proposals
required to implement the strategy. These proposals are now submitted to
the European Parliament and Council for adoption before they can become
legislation. </P>

<P>The most costly of the two proposals, and the one which provides the
largest benefit in terms of air quality, concerns the setting of tighter
emissions standards for passenger cars. The other proposal, providing smaller
but commensurate benefits, concerns tightening of fuel specifications for
gasoline and diesel fuel. Both proposals are intended to be implemented
by 1st January 2000. Further legislative proposals will be presented next
year concerning emissions standards for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles,
and vehicle inspection and maintenance. Moreover, the Commission has suggested
a follow-up to the Auto/Oil programme to evaluate the need for further
measures, and other EU initiatives are underway which target stationary
source emission controls.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>ROAD&nbsp;FUELS&nbsp;QUALITIES&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;YEAR&nbsp;2000</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The main changes to gasoline and diesel fuel quality specifications
are shown in the two tables below. The changes in the average qualities
for these transport fuels marketed in the EU, which are intended to result
from the specifications, are also given. </P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Table5-1.gif" HEIGHT=356 WIDTH=556></P></CENTER>

<P>The total cost of the Auto/Oil package is predicted at some 82.5 billion
ECU Net Present Value (NPV) over 15 years. Of this, the oil industrys
costs in implementing fuels changes will be in the region of 11.5 billion
ECU ($15 billion). Most of this is upfront capital investment of 7.2 billion
ECU. In practical terms, this means that, on average, every oil refinery
in the EU will have to find roughly $80 million to assure compliance. The
word average should be treated with caution because, for example, there
are a few complex refineries with low sulphur crude slates that will need
to do very little; some other refineries will be very hard hit. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>EMISSION&nbsp;REDUCTIONS&nbsp;DUE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;THE&nbsp;IMPROVED&nbsp;FUELS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The methodology used does not require that the contribution to the overall
emissions reductions due to the fuels part of the package should be in
approximately the same proportion as its share of the package costs (around
15 per cent). In fact, the fuels measures were only just selected as they
are among the least cost-effective of the measures chosen. Only benzene
(-15 to -20 per cent, but amounting to only a kilotonne or so of emissions
by 2010) and to a much lesser extent particulate matter (Pm, -6 per cent)
are reduced anything like commensurately by the fuels measures. The reductions
of NOx and VOCs are only a few per cent at best (see <A HREF="../VOLUME5/Contents.htm">CONCAWE
Review Volume 5, Number 1 (April 1996)</A>, pages 10 and 11 for more on
this). The small fuels effects on these particularly important pollutants
means that extreme fuel formulations with steeply higher costs, such as
Californian style gasoline and Swedish city diesel, are inappropriate for
general application across Europe.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Bol2.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=14><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>NEXT&nbsp;STEPS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The oil industry believes that, overall, the fuels proposals constitute
a well-judged response in an optimum package to meet real environmental
needs. Clearly, there is now much to do to inform properly those bodies
reviewing the proposals. If this is successful, it is expected that this
draft legislation will be adopted by the EU in the next year or two. </P>

introduced the purpose and scope of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive
(AQFD). This, together with its air pollutant-specific daughter directives,
will constitute the legal basis for the monitoring and control of air pollution
in the EU Member States. Over the past year, much work has been carried
out in the EU Working Groups which are developing the standards, and in
the UNICE* Shadow Groups. </P>

<P>So far, four position papers are being developed (on lead, NOx, SO2
and particulate matter (Pm)) by the four EU Working Groups in which Member
States (usually 6), the European Commission, the European Research Centre,
the Non-Governmental organizations, the European Environmental Agency and
Industry participate by supplying single representatives. The Commission
will use these position papers as a basis for developing draft proposals
for air quality standards and measurement requirements.</P>

<P>CONCAWEs major contribution is scientific analysis, and a CONCAWE AQFD
Coordination Group has been set up to coordinate the oil industry input
into the UNICE Shadow Groups and the cost-benefit study (see later). CONCAWE
has representatives in the Shadow Groups on NOx and SO2, and chairs the
Shadow Group on Pm through which it also takes on the role as the industry
representative on the EU Working Group on Pm. In view of its major interest
in benzene, CONCAWE will make available to UNICE a member company expert
to represent industry in the EU Working Group on the air quality standard
for benzene.</P>

<P>The EU Working Groups are developing a position paper for each pollutant,
which deals with all aspects of measurement and monitoring, and with health/environmental
risk characterization. Based upon the guidelines prepared by the WHO regional
office for Europe, the Working Groups have determined the range of values
which should be considered as health-/environment-based starting points
for EU ambient air quality standards. CONCAWE has concentrated its efforts
on the health risk characterizations since, in most cases, health protection
considerations will determine the scientific basis for the standards.</P>

<P>CONCAWE reports have been prepared for use in the UNICE Shadow Groups
and the EU Working Groups for each air pollutant currently under discussion
(except lead) and for the Phase 2 air pollutants (benzene, carbon monoxide
and ozone) on which work will start in the autumn of this year. </P>

<P>CONCAWE is also preparing a critical review of the recently published
epidemiological studies which form part of the Commission-funded APHEA
project (short-term effects of air pollution on health: a European approach
using epidemiological time series data). These studies have been carried
out in a number of European cities and investigate the associations between
exposures during episodes of air pollution, mortality and hospital admissions.
It is CONCAWEs opinion that these studies, because of their very nature,
can only be used for generating hypotheses, and not for quantitative risk
assessment.</P>

<P>Most of the work so far has been concentrated on the health/environmental
risk characterization and on the measurement and monitoring techniques.
Recently a consultant has been appointed by the Commission to study the
financial cost-benefits of setting a range of ambient air quality standards,
and the expected health benefits. This cost-benefit study was originally
planned to be carried out by each Working Group, but is now to be done
by the consultant on behalf of all working groups. Through UNICE, CONCAWE
is actively contributing to this study, using expertise gained in the Auto/Oil
study.</P>

<P>CONCAWE representatives will continue to input into the health risk
characterizations when the relevant CONCAWE reports are discussed in meetings
of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, the UNICE Shadow
Groups and the EU Working Groups.</P>

<P>CONCAWE representatives will also continue to stress the need for differentiation
between the risk characterization and the risk management processes (see
page 1 of <A HREF="../VOLUME5/Contents.htm">CONCAWE Review, Volume 5, Number
1 (April 1996)</A>. The experts involved in the risk characterization process
should not make their own choice as to which sensitive populations should
be protected. They should present to the risk manager all known dose-response
relationships for those populations which vary in degree of susceptibility.
It is the role of the risk manager to determine which populations should
best be protected with generic measures, such as ambient air quality standards,
and which should receive additional protection by following up with specific
tailor-made measures or advice.</P>

<P>The risk manager should combine and integrate the knowledge generated
in the review of measurement and monitoring methodologies and in the risk
characterization process with the results from the cost-benefit studies,
before deciding on a proposal for a numerical standard. In doing so, the
risk manager will need to understand the degree of certainty associated
with the health-/environmentally-based proposals for standards. A dialogue
between the risk assessors and the risk managers is therefore essential.</P>

NO2 guideline will suffice</FONT></TT></I></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>Nitrogen oxides are natural constituents of the atmosphere and, from
the point of view of health effects, the most important of them are nitrogen
monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), collectively referred to as NOx.
Emissions are roughly 90 per cent NO and 10 per cent NO2. However, in air
NO is rapidly oxidized to NO2, the oxide which has been studied more extensively
than NO. </P>

<P>People can breathe nitrogen oxides in low concentrations in air without
any apparent adverse effects but NOx in polluted urban air can, on occasions,
have a measurable effect on human breathing. However, these effects are
reversible, i.e. after the elevated exposure is ended, the function of
the lungs returns naturally to what it was previously. Although the effects
are reversible, some, such as excessive airway constriction, can be dangerous
to the individual concerned and must therefore be taken into account when
considering appropriate air quality standards. The air quality guideline
proposed for ambient NO2 concentrations by the World Health Organization
Regional Office for Europe (see also &quot;<A HREF="Urban1.htm">Linking
emissions to urban air quality</A>&quot; &amp; &quot;<A HREF="Urban2.htm">Predicting
future air quality</A>&quot;) is 200 &#181;g per cubic metre of air (0.11
ppm) measured over a 1-hour exposure period.</P>

<P>A great advantage of reversible health effects is, that they can be
researched in experiments with humans. For many air pollutants, much research
has been carried out with human volunteers in chamber studies where exposures
can be maintained at controlled levels and the effects can be measured
directly. The populations studied include healthy people, young and old,
and people with obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthmatics). The studies
have covered exposures to NO2, both on its own and in conjunction with
other materials which cause constriction of the airways. Exposure times
have ranged from 10 minutes to six hours, with or without exercise. Exposure
concentrations of NO2 in the chambers have ranged from 0.1 ppm to a high
of 4 ppm. </P>

<P>The effect of NO2 on lung function has been assessed by measuring lung
capacity (FEV1) and airway responsiveness (AR) following exposure of normal
and asthmatic patients to various concentrations of NO2. Based on normal
variability, a reduction in lung capacity of more than 5 per cent for healthy
individuals and about 11 per cent for patients with airways obstruction
(e.g. asthmatics) is necessary before the change from normal is considered
significant.</P>

<P>The results of all the research are, firstly, that healthy subjects
show no significant change in lung function from baseline at NO2 concentrations
as high as 2 ppm. Furthermore, studies of several hundred asthmatics indicate
that most patients with <B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>hronic <B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>bstructive
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>ulmonary <B><FONT SIZE=+1>d</FONT></B>isease
(COPD) also show no apparent change in lung function from baseline as a
result of exposure to NO2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 3 ppm. On
the other hand, five studies on asthmatic and other COPD patients exposed
to 0.3 ppm NO2 give different results. These five studies show decreases
of lung function ranging between 5.1 per cent and 14 per cent; however
only two of these studies have been published in full in peer-reviewed
journals.</P>

<P>Secondly, the data on airways responsiveness show that for both healthy
and asthmatic subjects, exposure to NO2 causes an increase in the response
to agents such as cold air, SO2 and ozone. However, the data also show
that the increased effect on lung function overall is small and indistinguishable
from normal variations.</P>

<P>Thus, overall, the evidence indicates that there is little or no change
in lung function as a result of short-term exposures to NO2 concentrations
up to a few ppm for both healthy subjects and patients with asthma and
obstructive airway disease. Concentrations of NO2 likely to be found in
ambient air cause marginal changes in lung function which are so small
as to be indistinguishable from the background variability of people breathing
unpolluted air.</P>

<P>The 1995 WHO-Europe guideline for NO2 is based on a 50 per cent uncertainty
margin applied to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 0.2
to 0.3 ppm for 1 to 2 hour experimental exposures to NO2 in chamber studies.
The health endpoints used by WHO-Europe are: a) small reductions in lung
function (&gt;5 per cent drop in FEV1); and b) changes in airway responsiveness.
</P>

<P>The 50 per cent uncertainty factor is based on a possible increased
airway responsiveness in one study at 0.1 ppm, and a meta-analysis (review
of epidemiological data from several studies) suggesting a threshold for
increased airway responsiveness below 0.2 ppm. WHO-Europe indicates that
the LOAEL for 'possible small effects in pulmonary function of asthmatics'
is about 0.21 ppm, and that simultaneous and/or sequential exposures to
NO2 and an aeroallergen (an allergic substance in aerosol form) 'increase
the risk of an exacerbated airway response'. The LOAEL for healthy persons
is acknowledged to be greater than 1 ppm. Thus the rationale for the 0.11
ppm NO2 guideline is to avoid changes in airway responsiveness and to avoid
exacerbation of airway constriction in COPD patients when concomitant exposure
to aeroallergens and NO2 occur.</P>

<P>It follows that a reasonable level of compliance (e.g. 98 per cent of
the time) with the precautionary WHO guideline will provide an adequate
level of health protection. </P>

</P>

<P>Benzene was included in the first list of priority substances for evaluation
under the requirements of the EU Regulation (No. 793/93) on the evaluation
and control of the risks of existing substances. There were 42 substances
on the first list, published in May 1994, and benzene is one of 18 for
which Germany is the rapporteur.</P>

<P>In Germany, the competent authority requested industry to prepare a
report, characterizing the risk for benzene, which would be used as the
basis for the risk assessment. When the rapporteur has prepared the risk
assessment report it will be reviewed by industry and EU Member States'
experts, before final approval. It was also agreed that all sources of
benzene (including its presence in gasoline) should be taken into account
in the risk characterization. The place of this risk characterization in
the overall risk assessment process was covered in CONCAWE Review Volume
4, Number 1 (April 1995), pp. 12-14. </P>

<P>The risk characterization report was prepared, under contract, by Exxon
Biomedical Sciences Inc. (EBSI) for CONCAWE, EUROPIA and the CEFIC Aromatic
Producers Association (APA). It was given to the German competent authority
in May 1996, who now has to prepare the EU risk assessment for benzene.
However, the time-scale for this is unclear and completion could take some
time. The purpose of this article is to explain briefly what is included
in the Industry report and to summarize the key findings regarding the
characterization of the environmental and health risks associated with
benzene.</P>

<P>The industry risk characterization report follows closely the Technical
Guidance Document which was prepared jointly by EU Member States, the Commission
and Industry. It represents the most up-to-date, comprehensive review of
the environmental and health effects of benzene. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>THE&nbsp;FINDINGS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><I>Health<BR>
</I>The report summarizes the various health effects that have been described
and identifies the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>o <B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>bserved
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>dverse <B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>ffect
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>evel (NOAEL) for each of them. The critical
human health effect (i.e. the adverse health effect of most concern) from
repeated occupational exposure to low levels of benzene is the occurrence
of <B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>cute <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>on-<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>ymphocytic
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>eukaemia (ANLL). </P>

<P>The epidemiology studies demonstrate that ANLL has occurred above occupational
exposure levels of 20-50 parts per million (ppm) of benzene in the ambient
air, i.e. 64 000 to 160 000 microgrammes per cubic metre (&#181;g/m3)
expressed as <B><FONT SIZE=+1>l</FONT></B>ong-<B><FONT SIZE=+1>t</FONT></B>erm
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>a</FONT></B>verage concentrations (LTA). ANLL has not
been observed in individuals occupationally exposed to levels of 1 ppm
or less. </P>

<P>Mechanistic studies indicate that the occurrence of ANLL is a multi-step
process and some of the steps do not occur unless a certain threshold concentration
is exceeded. It follows, that the overall process of the occurrence of
ANLL is dependent on a threshold concentration, which differs from the
previous view that, for benzene carcinogenesis, the threshold concentration
is zero.</P>

<P>The true threshold concentration for ANLL lies somewhere between 1 and
20 ppm LTA, possibly even higher. For the purpose of the risk characterization,
1 ppm (3200 (&#181;g/m3) has been taken as the NOAEL which is a conservative,
responsible approach.</P>

<P>The report includes the available exposure data for each of four sub-populations
of the general public, and 46 sub-populations of workers occupationally
exposed to benzene. For each of the sub-populations it calculates the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>m</FONT></B>argins
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>o</FONT></B>f <B><FONT SIZE=+1>s</FONT></B>afety (MOS)
i.e. the ratios of the NOAELs to the observed exposure concentrations which
occur. </P>

<P>The arithmetic mean levels of benzene to which the general public is
exposed are calculated to range from 8.6 &#181;g/m3 (2.7 parts per billion-ppb)
to 10.9 &#181;g/m3 (3.4 ppb). The MOS calculations show that the mean
degree of safety with respect to benzene carcinogenesis is about a factor
of 300 or more. Furthermore, urban benzene levels are expected to drop
substantially over the next few years due to the progressive replacement
of non-catalyst equipped cars and other legislated measures. Thus there
is at present no need for risk reduction measures beyond those that are
being applied already.</P>

<P>For the worker sub-populations, mean exposures are generally below 3200
&#181;g/m3 and therefore the cancer risk MOSs are above 1. Gathering further
information, and/or more testing is indicated for a few groups of workers.
</P>

<P><I>Environment<BR>
</I>All reported effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms are summarized
and, for each reported effect, the concentration at which no effect is
observed-the <B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>redicted <B><FONT SIZE=+1>n</FONT></B>o
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>ffect <B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>oncentration
(PNEC)-is identified. These PNECs are compared with the available information
on the measured or <B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>redicted <B><FONT SIZE=+1>e</FONT></B>nvironmental
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>c</FONT></B>oncentrations (PECs) of benzene in the various
environmental compartments, in order to identify scenarios involving risk.
</P>

<P>Most industrial benzene plants with advanced effluent treatment plants
pose no benzene-related environmental risks. In the few cases where there
is limited waste-water treatment the uncertainty is greater. For such sites,
further monitoring and emissions data are required to refine the evaluations.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Bol2.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=14><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>WHAT&nbsp;DOES&nbsp;IT&nbsp;MEAN?</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The existence of a threshold concentration means that the low levels
of benzene exposure for the general public poses no health risks. Further
controls on benzene emissions are not expected to have any effect at all
on the risk of contracting leukaemia.</P>

<P>From an occupational health point of view it is important to recognize
that, currently, there are only very few industrial activities possibly
associated with occupational exposures to benzene at levels greater than
1 ppm LTA. This is because either the operation itself is not practised
so widely and/or controls have been introduced to reduce exposure levels.
Continued monitoring is required, however, to verify the current situation
and to ensure that occupational exposure to benzene is kept within the
1 ppm level. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Water, air and soil-borne exposures to benzene do not pose a risk to
the environment, except possibly in some industrial and commercial situations
where there are no waste-water treatment facilities. Provided that further
monitoring can establish that benzene levels in surface waters are below
predicted no-effect levels at these locations, no further action is anticipated.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>The findings from the risk characterization of benzene should be used
effectively in continuing to underwrite the basis for an EU Occupational
Exposure Limit of 1 ppm for benzene and during the forthcoming discussions
on the development of an Air Quality Standard for benzene.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>If considered necessary, the rapporteur will recommend further risk
reduction measures and, for the petroleum industry, this would mainly concern
gasoline. However, it is agreed by the European Commission and Member States
that any measures relating to gasoline will not be recommended until a
risk assessment report has been prepared for gasoline itself under the
Existing Substances Regulation.</LI>

<P>Aspiration is the introduction of liquid into the lungs. It is almost
always an accidental process involving a single dose and it may occur directly
or indirectly. When it occurs directly liquids 'go down the wrong way',
i.e. they enter the respiratory tract rather than the digestive tract and
so find their way to the lungs. Aspiration frequently occurs indirectly
when hydrocarbon liquids are swallowed, following which vomiting occurs
as a natural reaction, and it is this secondary effect that may result

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>EFFECTS&nbsp;OF&nbsp;ASPIRATION&nbsp;OF&nbsp;HYDROCARBONS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The only class of substances that has received significant study in
terms of the effects of aspiration are hydrocarbons. Animal experiments
were performed by Gerarde and reported in 1963. He found that aspiration
of as little as 0.1 ml kerosine could be lethal to rats. In contact with
the lungs, light hydrocarbons spread rapidly and cause lung inflammation
which is referred to as 'chemical pneumonitis'. The latter condition develops
rapidly and it can be fatal for humans, just as much as for animals. Whereas
for gasoline a single lethal dose for adults would be about 400 ml if swallowed,
a much lower volume (perhaps 2 to 3 ml) could prove fatal, if aspirated.</P>

<P><I>Which petroleum products present an aspiration hazard?<BR>
</I>Gerarde found that all petroleum products having a viscosity below
45 SSU (Saybolt Seconds Universal) at 100&#176;F (37.8&#176;C)-equivalent
to 7 cSt at 40&#176;C-presented an aspiration hazard. In addition to individual
hydrocarbons he found that the normally-marketed products such as gasoline,
kerosine, diesel fuel, home heating oil and hydrocarbon solvents could
all cause mortality in animals by aspiration. However, a medicinal product
such as liquid paraffin was too viscous to cause significant effects, even
if it managed to reach the lung by aspiration. </P>

<P><I>Human experience of aspiration<BR>
</I>Analysis of hospital admissions has revealed that human exposure by
aspiration almost always occurs in domestic situations through the accidental
swallowing of petroleum products and subsequent vomiting. Such incidents
most frequently involve young children who are particularly at risk since
low doses can have serious effects. The temporary storage of solvents or
fuels in drinks containers can result in such incidents. A further obvious
adult activity that carries an aspiration risk is siphoning gasoline.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>EMERGENCY&nbsp;TREATMENT</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>For those involved in the emergency treatment of patients who have swallowed
petroleum products, the primary advice is that vomiting must not be induced
since this clearly carries the additional risk of secondary aspiration
of liquid into the lungs. The emergency treatment of patients who have
experienced aspiration is even more important. The key step is to obtain
medical attention immediately and make sure that the casualty is sitting
in a half upright position.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>CLASSIFYING&nbsp;AND&nbsp;LABELLING&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;THE&nbsp;ASPIRATION&nbsp;HAZARD</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The recognition of the need to classify and label petroleum products
for their aspiration hazard followed from industry pointing out this effect
to the Technical Progress Committee (TPC) of DG XI. Accordingly, since
ingestion was the route of exposure, the TPC determined that certain low
viscosity petroleum substances would be classified as 'Harmful' and would
be labelled with risk phrase R22 ('Harmful if swallowed') and safety phrase
S62 ('If swallowed, do not induce vomiting: seek medical advice immediately
and show this container or label'). Legislation was enacted in the shape
of directive 94/69/EC, the 21st adaptation to Technical Progress (ATP)
of the Dangerous Substances Directive (DSD) requiring the classification
and labelling of 142 gasoline naphthas and 31 kerosines, this to be implemented
in the EU by 30 September 1996. </P>

<P>Even when the 21st ATP was agreed in September 1994, members of the
TPC realized that there was a need for aspiration to have a separate hazard
classification with its own criteria, and work commenced almost immediately
on this subject.</P>

<P>Eventually, such criteria were defined and it was agreed that, for petroleum
substances and certain preparations that met the criteria, the classification
would be 'Harmful' and that labels would carry the risk phrase R65 ('Harmful:
may cause lung damage if swallowed') and the safety phrase S62. This requirement
is embodied both in the 22nd ATP of the DSD and the 4th ATP of the Dangerous
Preparations Directive (DPD). Both directives have to be introduced into
Member States' national legislation by 31 May 1998, but some competent
authorities are permitting the immediate use of R65 rather than R22. </P>

<P>Other important points relating to this legislation are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Aspiration is a stand-alone effect and cannot be regarded as additive
with any other toxicological effect, under the DPD. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Consumer products presenting an aspiration hazard must be supplied
in containers having child-resistant closures.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>The publication of the 22nd ATP, directive 96/54/EC and the criteria
for R65 means that suppliers must 'self-classify' their products for their
aspiration hazard and denote this in their labels and safety data sheets.

approach based on risk assessment, to the clean-up of contaminated sites.</FONT></TT></I></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>The nature and extent of oil contamination at a site can range from
major to trivial. More importantly, the potential for this soil and groundwater
contamination to expose a neighbour, an on-site worker, or another potential
receptor varies enormously. The first decision to take is whether the potential
health risks caused by soil/groundwater contaminants are severe enough
to require action. In many cases, if risks to human health or the environment
are minimal, then contaminants can be safely left to degrade naturally.
If action is required, then further decisions have to be taken as to how
much soil or groundwater needs to be cleaned, and what level of contaminants
can safely be left.</P>

<P>In the past, some countries have set fixed numerical criteria to decide
these issues. These limits are based on generic assumptions on site conditions
such as: soil type, depth to groundwater, geology and hydrogeology, and
proximity to potential receptors (e.g. water well, basement, surface water
body). Such an approach ignores the fact that contaminated oil industry
sites vary widely in terms of complexity, and the potential risk they may
pose to either human health or the environment. As fixed numerical criteria
are nearly always set at very low levels to ensure safety, their use leads
to the clean-up of more land than may be necessary. The result is wastage
of industry resources (and ultimately added expense to the consumer) conducting
clean-up with no incremental reduction in risk to human health and the
environment.</P>

<P>In recent years, the principles of risk-based corrective action have
been applied in a number of countries in Europe and in North America where
it has been developed by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM).
This follows a flexible approach to decision making whereby corrective
action is appropriately tailored to site-specific conditions and hazards.
This leads to more cost-effective solutions, and allows the greatest effort
to be applied where it is most beneficial. In its broadest sense, risk
assessment in relation to contaminated land can be defined as an evaluation
of whether there is a potential for adverse effects to occur, based on
factual knowledge about a site, scientific theories concerning the environmental
behaviour and toxicity of the chemicals present, assumptions which have
to be made where there is a lack of site-specific data, and predetermined
acceptability criteria.</P>

<P>Many CONCAWE member companies have been involved with this American
activity but realized that there are a number of differences between the
two continents and even within them. Their wish has been to develop similar
techniques for Europe and they have therefore established a task force
to carry out this work and produce a Guideline setting out the approach
which could be adapted to the situations prevailing in the various European
countries. </P>

<P>This guideline is now nearing completion and describes a three-tiered
approach to corrective action decision making. The CONCAWE guideline is
built on the premise that one begins with relatively little site data (using
conservative generic assumptions) and, through additional investigation
and analysis, progresses towards more site-specific knowledge and less
conservatism. The result is an equal level of protection of human health
and the environment throughout Tiers 1, 2 and 3.</P>

<P>The three-tiered approach in the Guideline is summarized schematically
in Figure 1. It starts with an initial assessment of the site, which involves
gathering general data including potential sources of contaminants, obvious
evidence of contamination, land-use, presence of potable groundwater, etc.
The pathways by which contaminants could reach populations and environmental
compartments at risk are also identified. This initial assessment is followed
by Tier 1 in which chemical data on the degree of contamination of the
site is collected and compared with Risk-Based Screening Levels (RBSL)
and other relevant criteria. The RBSLs comprise of a set of trigger concentrations
for contaminated soil and groundwater. These figures are not intended to
be soil standards or clean-up targets. If exceeded, they are simply an
indication that further study is required. RBSLs are derived using conservative
assumptions and contaminant migration models and, as such, are based on
a generalized risk assessment. If the observed values are below these levels,
then the risk will be insignificant.</P>

<P>In Tiers 2 and 3, the assessment involves refinements of the study to
take into account more site-specific considerations, with the possible
collection of additional data. The actual environmental compartments and
populations at risk are identified, along with the possible pathways. These
pathways are modelled to prepare quantitative risk estimates which can
be compared with acceptability criteria. There is an option at the end
of each of these Tiers to develop a corrective action programme based on
remediation to the newly derived Site Specific Target Levels (SSTL). Corrective
Actions could include taking no action or instituting a long-term monitoring
programme. </P>

<P>Although this procedure may seem complicated, it is expected to provide
a consistent framework for decision making. The outcome should be cost-effective
but still result in the clean-up of those sites where it is necessary to
protect man and the environment. </P>

integrity management.</FONT></TT></I></P></CENTER>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P>1996 has been a very active year for the Oil Pipelines Management Group
(OPMG), partly because DGXI invited CONCAWE to submit evidence to their
study on whether a major accident hazard directive on pipelines was required
and the OECD held a workshop in Oslo on a similar subject.</P>

<P>CONCAWE played an active role in planning the programme, publicising
it amongst the pipeline operators and providing speakers. More than 100
participants attended, representing most of the OECD member countries.
These included representatives from governments, other regulatory authorities,
academia, consultants, pipeline operators and industry organizations. </P>

<P>The CONCAWE presentations covered three main points which were introduced
in an initial overview presentation. These were:</P>

<UL>
<LI>pipelines are an essential element in the transport of petroleum products;</LI>

<LI>oil pipelines in Western Europe are a safe method of transport; and</LI>

<LI>the good safety record has not been achieved by chance, but through
application of rigorous safety management systems (generally called PIMS<B><FONT SIZE=+1>p</FONT></B>ipeline<B><FONT SIZE=+1>
i</FONT></B>ntegrity <B><FONT SIZE=+1>m</FONT></B>anagement <B><FONT SIZE=+1>s</FONT></B>ystems).</LI>
</UL>

<P>These topics were amplified in further presentations covering:</P>

<UL>
<LI>the results of the collection of incident data by CONCAWE over 25 years;</LI>

<LI>essential elements of a PIMS;</LI>

<LI>leak detection; and</LI>

<LI>measures to stop third-party damage in the Netherlands and France.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>All these presentations were well-received and led to lively discussions.
Indeed, the whole workshop was characterized by the active participation
in discussions by all the participants. Another notable feature was the
general consensus reached between the various groups. </P>

<P>The most important conclusion was that pipelines provide a vital and
safe means of transport for large volumes of potentially hazardous materials.
It was recognized that pipeline operators have compelling reasons for ensuring
the safety of their operations and that they have the primary responsibility
for ensuring this within a framework of regulation. </P>

<P>Another conclusion was that risk assessment was a necessary tool for
decision makers in both industry and government. However, it should be
used for comparing options rather than as a definitive means of decision
making. Risk assessment depends on the availability of reliable statistics.
</P>

<P>It was noteworthy that, although many people collect records of pipeline
incidents, the CONCAWE statistics are almost alone in also containing full
records of the relevant population of pipelines to which the incident data
applies. They are therefore invaluable to all involved in such risk assessments
and were quoted by many independent speakers. The workshop recommended
that more attention should be made to collecting accurate and usable data.
</P>

<P>Finally, the positive benefits of safety management systems were recognizedthese
should be an integral part of the overall management of a company. It was
therefore recommended that industry should share its experiences in this
field. This has been one of the major activities of OPMG since its inception.

<tt>CONCAWE is an effective and principled forum which exists because
its rational approach is essential to the proper resolution of complex issues.

<BR>

<CENTER><TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left>
<P>In the very first issue of the CONCAWE Review, Volume 1, Number 1 in
April 1992, the opening article entitled 'About CONCAWE' introduced our
organization to the worldwide Review readership which contains a very broad
spread of interests with a variety of needs. We hope that the existence
of the CONCAWE Review has kept you well informed about what CONCAWE is and
does. So we think it unnecessary to tell you again 'what CONCAWE is', but
'why CONCAWE is' may not be as clear.<BR>
<BR>
Most oil companies who refine crude oil in Western (OECD) Europe have chosen
to be CONCAWE members, several of them continuously so since 1963. Furthermore,
the possibility of associate membership for Eastern European oil companies
has recently been opened up and what is hopefully the first of many such
companies has already signed up. It is all of these companies that contribute
the essential resources to keep CONCAWE viable. The annual costs of CONCAWE
and the people who contribute management and technical expertise to CONCAWE
on a part-time basis are major commitments. These are particularly to be
appreciated in today's competitive times of downsizing and the need to extract
maximum value out of the existing assets.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE is founded as an international association with a scientific objective
and without profit-making intent. Our product is sound economic, technical
and scientific information and our mission is to disseminate it to all the
players with influence in our field. This means finding out as many of the
facts of a matter as can be determined by applying the rigour of a scientific
approach. Many issues are very complex and, where opinions are required,
CONCAWE's advice is rationally based and unbiased taking account of all
the knowledge that we can bring to bear. We publish our findings not only
for our sponsoring industry but for the neutral players and the opponents
too. CONCAWE's track record of trustworthiness is its greatest asset and
is carefully safeguarded in all it does.<BR>
<BR>
By maintaining CONCAWE, our members ensure that reliable information on
environmental, health and safety issues gets tabled, even if their own individual
situations may be somewhat different. Thus all the involved parties have
a true basis for a rational debate. But it's not altruism that keeps the
member companies speaking with one voice as CONCAWE; each company can fight
for its own interests in other forums. The companies are united in seeing
the fundamental needs for CONCAWE's existence and the greater cost-effectiveness
achievable by this approach. What the companies also gain by working cooperatively
through CONCAWE is elimination of the replication of many tasks which each
company would otherwise have to do for itself. In the field of environment health and safety, the involvement of a wide range of scarce specialists can be necessary. Both the quality and the quantity of what is done are enhanced by fielding the companies' best and most dedicated experts together in teams which are well-managed to get timely results.<BR>

Now is a very busy time for CONCAWE. It is not only the large number of
initiatives underway but also their complexity. These days, many more issues
need to be addressed across the boundaries of the different scientific,
technical and economic fields that CONCAWE represents. <BR>

<B>AIR QUALITY </B></center><BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE's work on the EU's Air Quality Framework Directive involves even
more than the five List 1 pollutants mentioned in the article on page 6.
From List 2, there are also benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide
and nickel on which CONCAWE has substantial contributions to develop.<BR>
<BR>
The work for the European Auto/Oil Programme is at last nearing completion.
The results, in the form of European Commission draft proposals for EU legislation,
are due out at any moment. <BR>

<B>MOTOR FUELS AND EMISSIONS </B></center><BR>
<BR>
A major new study commenced by CONCAWE relates to the particulate matter
in car exhaust emissions, focusing on the very fine particles that are emitted
from gasoline as well as from diesel cars. The objective is to quantify
these emissions in terms of particle size and distribution. As a first step,
a literature review of particle size measurement techniques has been completed.
A special effort has started to redefine how best in future to publish the
auto emissions regulations and fuel specifications data in view of its rapidly
growing bulk. <BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<B>WATER QUALITY, SOIL &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The EU is developing a coordinated range of policies and legislative instruments
to cover all aspects of water management. These include water supply, groundwater
protection, quality of the aquatic environment, discharges to water and
other aspects. These will also relate to the Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control Directive (IPPC). To be in a position to respond to these developments,
CONCAWE has an active task force on a risk assessment approach to soil and
groundwater clean-up targets which is making good progress. A new task force
to look at aspects of Best Available Technology (BAT) and its relationship
to the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) approach is in the process of
being formed.<BR>
<BR>
The two task forces on waste legislation and refinery waste have completed
and reported their work and have been wound up.

<B>REFINING PLANNING</B></center> <BR>
<BR>
The 1994 Planning Cycle supply/demand basis for the years 2000 and 2010
(CONCAWE Document 95/02) has served well for evaluation of the refining
implications of the road fuels in the Auto/Oil Programme (see page 10).
Now, a new Planning Cycle has been started which will update and extend
the timescale of the plans to 2020. Discussions with the European Commission's
DG-XVII (Energy Directorate) have been held to initiate the work. <BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<B>OIL PIPELINES</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The 1994 results of the annual spillage performance survey are briefly summarized
in the article on page 22. These regular surveys (recorded in publications
dating back to 1973) are now proving their value as the EU has commenced
a study into major hazards aspects of pipelines. CONCAWE is participating
in this study and the performance reports provide a unique record demonstrating
the safety of well-managed pipelines as a means to transport oil products.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE will also participate and is assisting with the organization of
a workshop on pipelines which will be held under the auspices of the OECD
in Oslo in June. <BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<B>SAFETY MANAGEMENT</B> </center><BR>
<BR>
The first report on the frequency of accidents in the European Oil Industry
will be produced shortly and is summarized in the article on page 20. A
new task force on the vetting of barges used for transporting oil and petrochemical
products has attracted wide support from member companies. The aim is to
ensure that these barges are 'fit for purpose' but, at the same time, to
minimize the number of inspections by the sharing of information. <BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<B>HEALTH AND PRODUCT SAFETY </b></center><BR>
<P>Benzene was on the first priority list for risk assessment under the
EU's Existing Substances Regulation. The German rapporteur required that
industry produces the draft risk characterization, and CONCAWE has collaborated
with CEFIC's Aromatic Producers Association Sector and EUROPIA on this project.
Documentation has been provided to the rapporteur who is required to produce
the definitive risk assessment together with any recommendations for risk
management.<BR>
<BR>
The environmental hazard classification of petroleum substances according
to Dangerous Substances Directive criteria is being addressed by the Technical
Progress Committee working party of DG-XI (Environment Directorate). CONCAWE
is working with the European Chemicals Bureau and with representatives from
some Member States to develop proposals for petroleum substances groups,
based both on experimental data and hydrocarbon composition. It is expected
that DG-XI will make decisions on many of the classifications before the
end of this year.<BR>

<center><TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left> <BR>

<P>In the last issue of the CONCAWE Review (Volume 4, Number 2, October
1995) the article on pages 4 and 5 described how the European Commission,
the Member States and the industries concerned were organizing the joint
development of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive (AQFD). In that article,
CONCAWE welcomed this further opportunity to assist the Commission to continue
with a rational approach to the development of EU environmental legislation.
To expand on what is said in the Foreword to this issue of the Review, some
features that CONCAWE believes are necessary ingredients in the process
are described below.
<center>
<P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>RISK ASSESSMENT</b>
</center>
<P>The pollutant types addressed in the AQFD, e.g. nitrogen oxides (NOx),
sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (Pm), lead (Pb) and ozone (O3),
occur naturally in ambient air at some concentration. Knowing that there
are health and environmental hazards linked with elevated levels of the
pollutants, by itself, tells society nothing definitive about whether or
what action should be taken. Put simply, life cannot ever be made hazard
free; only the level of risk can be reduced.<BR>
<BR>
Thus risk assessment is essential, and the concept of risk management is
introduced. The Commission has prepared an 'issues' paper which sets out
these factors and recognizes the need to establish the dose-response relationship
for each pollutant. Taken together with the costs for compliance with various
levels in the range of the dose response curve, these enable the risk manager
to be in a position to determine an appropriate standard by comparing levels
of risk reduction with the associated costs.<BR>
<BR>
An unavoidable complication inherent in the risk relationships is that they
should include considerations regarding sensitive minorities (asthmatics
taking exercise, for example). Thus the process should be extended to include
the dimension of the target group to be protected. CONCAWE considers that
the dose response curves for both the sensitive minorities and the next
most sensitive population, together with the factoring in of the relevant
risk management procedures (e.g. rescheduling exercise routines, self-medication),
all have a part to play in setting appropriate air quality standards.
</TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER>

<center><TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left> <BR>
<center>
<P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>LIMIT VALUE/ALERT THRESHOLD/PERCENTILE COMPLIANCE</b>
</center>

<P>CONCAWE believes it is self-evident that these aspects are interrelated
and form an essential part of the overall consideration of the risk management
step.<BR>
<BR>
The function of a limit value air quality standard (AQS) is to provide continuous
protection of the target group based on an assessment of risk and cost.
Compliance with a limit value in the EU will generally be based on an emission
reduction strategy, e.g. implementing control measures.<BR>

<br>
<center>
<IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Pg7.gif">
<br><br>
<tt>
General emissions controls can be cost-effective<br>
up to certain compliance percentiles, beyond which<br>
localized risk management  strategies are more appropriate.</tt></center>
<br>
<P>The alert threshold concept recognizes that for infrequent occurrences
(e.g. when a severe meteorological temperature inversion episode traps high
pollutant levels), general emission control approaches are extremely cost-inefficient
and specific risk management schemes are more appropriate. Thus alert thresholds
open up practical approaches to avoid spending a great deal of society's
money on reducing emissions to meet conditions that only occur for a few
hours/days in a given year at any one location. <BR>
<BR>
Percentile compliance setting serves to address two aspects. The first recognizes
that total compliance, as distinct from almost total compliance, can result
in significant increases in compliance costs for little additional protection.
The second aspect is that there is some optimal split between emission control
strategies and risk management strategies in providing the most cost-effective
protection of the target group. Here, the nature of the exceedances of the
relevant AQS needs to be understood. For example, are the exceedances confined
to discrete ongoing 'pollution episodes' or short daily events spread over
long time periods? Analysis of data from short-term continuous measurements
(e.g. as available in Germany) will provide some necessary guidance to the
process.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>SHORT-TERM STANDARDS (e.g. 15 MINUTES)</b></CENTER>

<P>EU Member States have expressed significant concerns about setting very
short-term standards-specifically with regard to human health considerations
related to SO2 exposures. It is recommended that the Working Group should
fully evaluate the potential for the derivation of a robust 'surrogate'
longer-term standard (e.g. 24 hours) that would be comparably protective
against the short-term effects. The resulting significant simplification
of measurement requirements would reduce the compliance costs without increasing
the health risk.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>INDUSTRY EMISSION CONTROLS COST DATA</b></CENTER>

<BR>
<P>The individual industry sectors are each attempting to identify the costs
of reduction targets, e.g. for SO2: &shyp;20%, &shyp;40%, &shyp;60%, from
a base of 'today'. This should permit the Working Group to relate these
data to a range of possible limit values drawn from the dose-response relationships
and today's measured air quality. This equal reduction concept for all sectors
should simplify the assessment, for example, by eliminating the need for
source-receptor modelling.

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
</B> 
<B>AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK DESIGN</b></CENTER>

<BR>
<P>The following technical issues will need particular attention in network
design guidelines to be developed by the European Environment Agency and
the Commission's Joint Research Centre: </B>
<UL>
<LI>What site classification system is required to enable the principle
of representative sites to be used reliably? 
<LI>What siting criteria should be used and how can they be related to the
principle that measured air quality should be an appropriate surrogate for
individual exposure over the averaging time of the standard? (Note: particulates
exposure over 24 hours; NO2 exposure over 1 hour.) 
<LI>What criteria should be used to define the minimum number of sites for
a given pollutant? 
<LI>What criteria should be set for acceptable 'assessment' techniques?
<LI>What criteria should be set for acceptable dispersion models?

<P>There are two distinct issues concerning atmospheric ozone. One is about
stratospheric ozone; the thinning of the ozone layer which protects Earth's
ecology from damage by too much ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The
other concerns pollution of the air in the biosphere, with elevated concentrations
of ozone resulting from mankind's activities. Air quality standards for
ozone relate to this low-altitude issue only.

<P>Ozone is naturally present in the air we breathe and can also be generated
from photochemical reactions involving hydrocarbon vapours and oxides of
nitrogen. The concerns about ozone arise from human health effects and ecological
effects, resulting from exposure of humans and crops or other vegetation
respectively, to low but significant levels of ozone. The issues surrounding
the setting of air quality standards for ozone have been described in CONCAWE
Report No. 95/60.

<P>Based on a review of the existing knowledge about human and animal health
effects of ozone, coupled with the present uncertainties as to what truly
constitutes an adverse health effect, two different approaches to setting
an air quality standard are plausible at the present time. A scientifically
defensible air quality band for ozone could range from 0.12-0.20 ppm
(235-392 &#181;g/m3) as a 1-hour average to protect against the triggering
of human respiratory symptoms such as losses of lung functionality, coughing
and so forth. On the other hand, a more conservative air quality band to
protect against inflammation and the potential development of chronic lung
disease resulting from longer-term exposures at lower ozone concentrations,
could range from 0.06-0.12 ppm (117-235 &#181;g/m3) as an 8-hour
average. The higher end of these bands should protect the majority of individuals
under most conditions of exposure. The lower end of the bands will increase
the probability that more potentially sensitive sub-populations are protected
under more rigorous conditions of exposure.

<P>As the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing human and animal
health data are equivocal, arguments can be made to support both the lower
as well as the higher end of the ranges, presented above. Because ambient
levels of ozone are known to fall within these ranges at some times and
in some places, other considerations such as technical feasibility and cost
of the control measures need to be factored into human health risk management
decisions. Not doing so would risk wasting society's resources which would
be better employed on other priorities.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Selecting a single air quality band to protect against ecological effects
(i.e. on vegetation) on a broad European basis cannot yet be done credibly
given the current lack of a consistent scientific effects basis. Although
it is known that ozone can produce adverse effects on vegetation, there
is not yet a clear understanding of the relationships between ozone concentration,
duration of exposure, ozone uptake by the plant, and adverse plant response.
Numerous factors which can substantially affect these relationships have
been identified but not adequately examined in the existing studies. These
factors include soil and meteorological conditions, placement of leaves
within the canopy, the mechanisms which open and close the pores on leaf
surfaces, and cellular factors. 
<H4><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
</H4>
It is also noteworthy that the scientific community has been unable to decide
upon a single acceptable form of exposure index to weight the short-term
peak exposures and the long-term exposure levels in terms of an ecological
effect. A number of indices are being evaluated for use with European and
United States crop data. One reason for the lack of consensus is that key
aspects of an effect-causing exposure regime (e.g. importance of peak concentrations,
duration of respite periods, etc.) are inadequately defined for the existing
indices. Nevertheless, there is general agreement that a mean exposure level
is not an appropriate index for modelling ozone exposure regimes which may
result in adverse effects on vegetation. Significantly different exposure
regimes can result in the same value of a mean index, and much higher short-term
exposure levels may be 'hidden' in a mean index. At present, it appears
that all indices being evaluated are data set specific, i.e. while they
may adequately correlate exposure with effect for the specific crops tested
and under the specific local conditions (soil, climate etc.), they may not
adequately correlate exposure and effect for other crops, regions, or conditions.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>It can be concluded that determining the significance of the ecological
effects of man-made contributions to ozone air quality at the present time
remains firmly in the realms of fundamental scientific research. Whilst
a good deal of exposure data is available for ozone, a satisfactory parameter
to express an environmental standard has not yet been devised.

<BR>
One of the many 'bricks in the wall' of the urban nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emission controls cost-effectiveness evaluation for the Auto/Oil Programme
(see CONCAWE Review Volume 4, Number 2, pages 10 and 11) was the definition
of the costs of modifying road transport fuels, i.e. gasoline and diesel
fuels, in ways which would provide improvements to the emissions of the
vehicle fleet, i.e. cars, trucks, buses, etc. As the project manager for
the cost-effectiveness aspect, DG-III (Industry) of the European Commission
appointed Touche Ross which used the independent consultant Arthur D. Little
Ltd. (ADL) to identify the implications in terms of the capital cost, the
fixed operating cost, the energy cost and the total cost effect expressed
in terms of Net Present Value.<BR>
<BR>
The process started in April 1995 with delegates from EUROPIA (oil industry),
ACEA (auto industry) and DG-XI sitting together to agree on a basis for
the average qualities for gasoline and diesel fuel for year 2000. This was
done taking into account the direct and indirect effects of existing EU
legislation and oil industry initiatives which, by the year 2000, will improve
the emissions potential of road fuels. Particularly noteworthy amongst these
changes are: for gasoline, average benzene content is coming down from 2.8
per cent v/v to 2.3 per cent and sulphur content down from 450 ppm (m/m)
to 300 ppm; whilst for diesel fuel, sulphur content is coming down from
about 2000 ppm (m/m) to 450 ppm. <BR>

<TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left> The delegates' next step was
to agree a matrix of 4 gasoline and 4 diesel fuel packages representing
progressively more restrictive universal (EU-wide) reformulations and a
city diesel case (Case V) for up to 25 per cent of diesel demand. NOx had
already been established as the air quality aspect of first concern from
the technical viewpoint, i.e. air quality did not meet the required air
quality standards (AQS) by the year 2010. Thus, NOx emission was a prime
factor in picking the fuel packages, with hydrocarbon (and benzene) and
particulate emissions also targeted for gasoline and diesel, respectively.
The fuels packages qualities and emissions effects (Tables 1 and 2) and
the corresponding array of costs as published by ADL (Table 3) are shown
in terms of the NPV in millions of ECU (multiply by 1.3 to give US$ millions).<BR>

There are many possible pitfalls when developing costs for a non-homogeneous
set of refineries such as exist within the EU oil refining sector, particularly
in the face of an anticipated very tight study budget and time pressures.
Not the least of the problems comes with the cost bases and units used:
care has to be taken about whether Net Present Values (NPVs) or Capital
Expenditures are being shown, in ECUs or $s, in millions or billions (i.e.
giga-). Tables 3 and 4 have been left in the format of their original publication
to illustrate this point.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE had decided a year earlier to set up its own task force (AE/STF-9)
for an in-depth investigation of costs, and to prepare for a validity check
on the eventual analyses. This group set up hypothetical cases with extreme
universal quality/compositions and evaluated the costs for these severely
reformulated gasoline and diesel fuels singly and together. As it transpired,
STF-9's 'severe' gasoline case was similar to ADL's Gasoline Package IV;
the 55 cetane diesel to Diesel Package III and the 58 cetane diesel to Diesel
Package IV.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE's study has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 95/54. In summary,
the published capital costs found are shown in Table 4 in giga US$. Dividing
these figures by 1.3 (to give ECU) and multiplying by about 1.8 (to give
NPV for Package IV/IV, for example) demonstrates the reasonably close agreement
with the corresponding ADL package costs.<BR>

Attention is drawn to the magnitude of the costs of such extreme fuels changes
in the light of the small emissions effects. It is unsurprising to CONCAWE
that these were found by Auto/Oil to be clearly out of the running.<BR>

<P>The new report<I> Motor Vehicle Emission Regulations and Fuel Specifications
in Europe and the United States-1995 update </I>(report 5/95) is available
from CONCAWE. For the first time, the report restricts itself to events
in Europe and the United States in view of the large amount of information
to be reported. A worldwide update is planned for 1997 (meanwhile report
4/94 should be retained for information on countries outside Europe and
the United States).<br>
<br><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>EUROPE</b></CENTER>
<P>The update includes an account of the European Auto/Oil Programme, the
EU Commission initiative that resulted from Directive 94/12/EC which required
the submission of proposals for further reductions in exhaust emissions
by 1 June 2000. It also covers the regulatory regime of European countries
that do not comply with European Union (EU) regulations. Recent EU members
Austria, Finland and Sweden are undergoing a four-year transitional period
after which their regulations will either be harmonized with those of the
EU or further renegotiated. Austria has adopted EU directives for passenger
cars and light- and heavy-duty vehicles but not those for mopeds and motorcycles.
Finland has adopted those for cars and heavy-duty vehicles, and Norway has
adopted all relevant EU directives. A number of countries from central and
eastern Europe are expected to join the EU by the year 2000 (Poland and
Hungary have already applied), by which time they plan to have brought their
environmental legislation in line with that of the EU. It is thought that
the Czech Republic has conformed to EU regulations since 1992/93 and that
these regulations also apply in Slovakia.<BR>
<BR>
Although a benzene content of no more than 5 per cent by volume is specified
for all gasolines in EU countries, several countries have or are about to
have lower limits. In Italy, for example, a 3 per cent limit was adopted
on 1 January 1993. In 1995, voluntary agreements were made with oil companies
to further limit benzene content (e.g. 1.8 per cent). A ministerial decree
passed in September 1995 requires that from 1 July 1997 a 1.4 per cent limit
will apply to all Italy's gasolines, and will reduce to 1 per cent from
July 1999.<br>

<P> In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has issued a Final Rule that will apply California Air Resources Board
(CARB) low emission standards (LEV) for light-duty vehicles to members of
the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC, which comprises the District of Colombia
and 12 eastern states) with effect from the 1999 model year. The rule will
allow, but not require states to adopt zero emission levels (ZEV). The EPA
has proposed an alternative national LEV schedule which will involve a phased
introduction of the Californian LEV, with all states adopting Californian
LEVs by the model year 2001. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has no authority
to promulgate such standards, which can thus only be adopted by voluntary
agreements<BR>

<p>.The OTC states are working towards a voluntary agreement with
motor manufacturers but the desire of some states to adopt ZEVs has been
a stumbling block. The EPA has assured the oil industry that it will not
impose nationwide gasoline standards as part of a national LEV programme,
unlike the Californian programme which will require very low-sulphur (30
ppm) reformulated gasoline.<br>
The report highlights the growing intricacies of US legislation. CONCAWE's
summary of the 'complex model' for certifying reformulated gasolines runs
to some twelve pages, incorporating 21 tables. Similarly, the regulations
controlling the mandatory use of deposit control additives in gasoline has
been distilled down to four pages, including two tables. The implications
of these changes, in terms of the administration burden alone, cannot yet
be estimated. What is clear, however, is that a vast array of records must
be kept accurately, since missing data, any misclassification of gasoline,
inconsistency between blending and shipping records, or other record-keeping
problems all constitute a violation of the regulations. The associated penalty
is up to $25 000 per day, per violation.<br>
<BR>
<TABLE border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=6> <tr>
<td valign="top" align="left">

<p>In the area of heavy-duty vehicles and buses, the EPA, CARB and members
of the automobile engine industry have signed a Statement of Principles
on how to achieve a NOx emissions limit of 2.0 grams per brake horse power
per hour (g/bhp.h) by the year 2004. The EPA is expected to make a final
rule on alternative limits of non-methanic hydrocarbons (NMHC) + NOx of
2.4 g/bhp.h or NMHC+NOx of 2.5 g/bhp.h plus a maximum NMHC of 0.5 g/bhp.h.
The automobile industry has agreed to meet these standards on the understanding
that the EPA will not further reduce particulate standards for diesel engines
nor CO emissions requirements for spark-ignition engines. Furthermore, the
EPA is required to assess the effects of fuel parameters on emissions so
that any needed changes in fuel quality can be legislated by October 2003.
It is calculated that the NOx reductions in the Statement of Principles
will reduce emissions by 900 000 tons a year by the year 2020 (by which
time the truck and bus fleet will have been entirely replaced).<BR>

CARB has published the specification for a reference diesel fuel (see table)
against which suppliers have to measure the performance of their products.
Any fuel is allowed that has equivalent emissions to this reference fuel.
A number of Californian suppliers have produced alternative composition
fuels which testing shows meet these criteria overall, although most have
a much higher cetane number and somewhat more aromatics than the reference
fuel. Thus the strict limits specified in the table do not necessarily have
to be complied with on all points.

<P>A recent CONCAWE report (no. 2/95 Alternative fuels in the automotive
market) reviews, in a European context, the advantages and disadvantages
of alternative road transport fuels when compared with conventional petroleum
derived fuels. The alternative fuels are considered in two broad classifications:
<UL>
<LI>gaseous fuels (from non-renewable sources); and 
<LI>'biofuels' (derived from renewable agricultural produce). 
</UL>
Methanol does not fit comfortably into either classification. Its major
source is currently natural gas but it can be made from any carbonaceous
material including agricultural products or by-products.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom

<P>Gaseous fuels have been used on a limited scale for many years. Historically
they have been employed for a mixture of economic, availability and environmental
reasons. Being gaseous and of relatively narrower compositional range than
conventional liquid fuels they have the potential to be low emissions engine
fuels. However, they do require more expensive and technically complex on-board
storage and distribution systems. In addition, larger volumes of fuel are
needed to move the same vehicle weight a given distance. The extra weight
of on-board storage compounds this problem. Emissions are better in some
respects when compared with gasoline or diesel fuel, but worse in others-particularly
methane, a greenhouse gas which is not considered in US emission limits.
Substantial investments are required by both fuel supplier and vehicle owner
to 'get started' with compressed natural gas (CNG). Liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) offers much lower investment entry costs but the amounts that
are potentially readily available are considerably smaller. All gaseous
fuels present hazards that are different from their conventional liquid
counterparts and which need to be assessed. In addition, 'well to wheel'
energy balances continue to favour liquid fuels.

<P>Natural gas and LPG are particularly suitable for consideration as fuels
for buses in city centre use. The potential environmental improvement is
at its greatest, limited range is less of a problem and fleet refuelling
facilities at depots is a practical proposition. Several cities have trial
vehicles or fleets already in service. LPG can be viable, with suitable
fiscal encouragement, in dual fuel applications for gasoline cars as well
as for bus fuels. However, service station facilities are limited or non-existent
in many countries.

<P>Methanol is purported to offer two air quality benefits over gasoline,
i.e. lower ozone forming potential plus minimal benzene and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon emissions (assuming the use of methanol as a neat fuel). Offset
against these advantages are high formaldehyde and buta-1,3-diene emissions.
Methanol has only half as much energy per unit volume compared with gasoline,
so limited vehicle range may be a problem. The most serious drawback of
all is the toxicity of methanol, which poses major problems for storage,
distribution, dispensing and accidental or deliberate ingestion or exposure.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom

<P>The use of oxygenate materials derived from agricultural produce as transportation
fuels is also receiving considerable attention in Europe. Since they are
produced from renewable resources, biofuels appear to offer no net CO2 emissions
and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. However, the true situation is
more complex. In the case of bioethanol, the energy consumed in producing
the fuel can equal the energy content of the ethanol itself, so that there
are no net CO2 and virtually no energy gains. The use of rape-seed methyl
ester (RSME) produced from oil-seed rape (canola or colza) oil gives a positive
energy balance, but even here half the energy content of the fuel is required
in its manufacture. Oxygenated fuels can give lower emissions of HC and
CO, but some emissions, notably NOx, can be increased, and effects on diesel
particulates are variable. The true costs of biofuels are several times
higher than those of conventional gasoline and diesel fuels, and alternative
investments are likely to achieve greater environmental and energy gains.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The oxygenates called MTBE and ETBE and several other ethers commonly
blended into gasoline have, by and large, uncontroversial chemical structures
from the public health viewpoint and very good octane, i.e. anti-knock,
quality. These materials are being promoted by the environmental and health
pressures to decrease gasoline sulphur, benzene, aromatics and olefins contents.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Small-sized MTBE plants, typically 50 to 100 kt/year, sometimes fit in
with the feedstock available in EU cat cracking refineries, and many of
these and other special niche opportunities have already been built. The
next step would mainly entail large grass-roots projects and these would
be very much more expensive. A 500 kilotonnes/year (kt/yr) butane dehydrogenation
based MTBE/ETBE plant needing a ready supply of methanol or ethanol would
cost roughly US$350 million to build. A 600 kt/yr methanol plant, big enough
to supply three of the MTBE plants, could easily cost some $400 million
including the requisite natural gas feedstock and logistics infrastructures.
Such a plant would most likely not be built in the EU but in a remote region
with a sizeable natural gas field to underpin the economy of scale benefits.
These special factors tend to hold down the prices of methanol on the world
markets. Regarding bioethanol, it has been calculated that to compete with
methanol at the few EU locations where the petroleum part of the MTBE/ETBE
feed could be found, the bioethanol would command a price which is only
about one sixth of its EU production cost.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom

<P>Such world-scale oxygenate plant projects, in places which are much less
politically stable than the EU, clearly present major financing and commercial
difficulties. The before-tax prices of conventional road fuels made from
crude oil are, in relation, actually very cheap, being typically only about
one third of what the motorist pays. Thus even MTBE projects are risky and
are hard-pressed to produce a competitively priced product.

<P>Emissions from motor vehicles are only one source of atmospheric pollution
but represent, for the general public, an all too obvious cause for concern.
CONCAWE has always tried to put the contribution of automotive emissions
in perspective and has long advocated the need to study the vehicle and
its fuel as a single 'system'. CONCAWE's Automotive Emissions Management
Group (AE/MG) therefore welcomed the European Commission's 'Auto/Oil' initiative
and many of its fuels and emissions experts contributed long hours to the
European Programme on Emissions, Fuels and Engine Technologies (EPEFE).
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME5/Bol2.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>An example of how AE/MG and its associated task forces proceed is illustrated
by CONCAWE's EPEFE work on the influence of heavy gasoline components on
exhaust emissions. In the USA, it has been shown that heavy components in
gasoline can increase certain emissions of the US car fleet by 10 to 30
per cent. But not only are US cars different from the European parc, US
gasolines are different too, being in general a wider cut from refineries
because the road fuels demand pattern is very different. This is partly
due to the fact that diesel cars are rare in the US and common in Europe.
Thus a technical information gap needed to be filled and CONCAWE was asked
to respond. The steps taken in this project were as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Defining the question: it was decided that not only the boiling range
(volatility) needed investigation but also the effect of the various chemical
species involved, as both are potentially influential variables. 
<LI>Designing the project: it was ascertained that a 10-car fleet, a 7-fuels
matrix, and measurement of exhaust Hydrocarbon (by species), CO and NOx
were required; the test protocols and so on were identified. 
<LI>Budgeting for costs; identifying a schedule and resources required:
an agreement by CONCAWE's member companies to fund the study was obtained.
<LI>Overseeing the experimental work: this was carried out in the research
laboratories of the members with suitable facilities and with the capacity
to meet deadlines. 
<LI>Analysing the results: statistical techniques were required to separate
out the small fuels effects from the large differences in vehicle performances.
<LI>Peer review and report: CONCAWE reports are generated by task forces
and reviewed by AE/MG and others. One such report recently published shows
in essence that, in the European context, gasoline back end volatility has
only a small and discontinuous effect on exhaust emissions. 
</UL>
<BR>
Although EPEFE was a massive exercise with the two industries (represented
by EUROPIA and ACEA) cooperating at an unprecedented level, it should not
be assumed that the programme was the end of the story. As our understanding
of the environment develops, new potential problems may emerge. That understanding
is not limited to tail-pipe or evaporative emissions but has to take into
account air quality issues and possible health effects. CONCAWE's work is
becoming increasingly multi-disciplinary and this is reflected in closer
ties between AE/MG and the Air Quality and Health Management Groups. The
more 'traditional' role of the Automotive Emissions Management Group continues-AE/MG
and its Task Forces have to keep abreast of other developments, notably:
<UL>
<LI>emissions legislation and test procedures; 
<LI>vehicle and fuel technology; and 
<LI>alternative fuels, particularly natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG). 
</UL>
<BR>
Within this portfolio, AE/MG has already embarked on two new projects: 
<UL>
<LI>particulate size and distribution; and 
<LI>cold start emissions.

These projects will encompass both gasoline and diesel vehicles, so two
new Task Forces, staffed by both gasoline and diesel specialists, have been
set up. This is a departure from previous CONCAWE automotive emissions studies,
which tended to focus on either gasoline or diesel fuel. STF-1, the gasoline
emissions group, has met as required over the past 15 years, and the diesel
emissions team (STF-7), which was created some years later, has been equally
active. Some twenty reports have been published and numerous scientific
papers have been presented at such prestigious meetings as those of the
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). STF-1 and STF-7 are now standing
down and this article provides an opportunity for AE/MG to publicly thank
the Task Force members for all their work.<br>

<BR>
<B>PARTICULATE SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION</b></CENTER>
<P>The potential health effects of fine particulate matter (Pm) below the
conventional size threshold of 10 microns (Pm10) have become a matter of
increasing interest. On the legislative front, a particulates standard will
be incorporated in the impending Air Quality Framework Directive. In addition,
a recent review by the UK Government has indicated that significant numbers
of particles in this size range are produced by both gasoline and diesel
engines-a move away from the conventional wisdom that diesel engines are
the sole source of automotive particulates. Unfortunately, little sound
information is available on particle size distribution from gasoline or
diesel engines, and measurement techniques are still being developed. Given
the lack of published information relating to this topic in Europe, CONCAWE
has decided that an authoritative scoping study would add to the general
understanding of the subject.<BR>
<BR>
The objectives of the programme are: </B>
<UL>
<LI>To develop information on particulate size, number and mass distribution
from current diesel and gasoline engines, using currently available measurement
techniques. 
<LI>To compare results from different laboratories and establish the best
techniques, with some information on their reproducibility. 
</UL>
<BR>
As a first step, a literature review has been completed which has identified
appropriate generic classes of equipment for measuring automotive particulates.
It was then necessary for CONCAWE to establish the best currently available
test methods for particulate emissions sizing. These techniques are very
specialized, and so it has been decided that the information is best developed
in cooperation with recognized outside experts in this field. Project planning
is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the programme will be
completed in 1996.<br><br><br>

CONCAWE published the first of its product dossiers in 1992. The series,
which will include 11 volumes (of which seven are already published, see
box below), was conceived to help the industry's approach to classification
and labelling, risk assessment and the provision of information in safety
data sheets. Each volume is prepared jointly by CONCAWE's Petroleum Products
and Health Management Groups and summarizes all the information available
on a major petroleum product group, dealing with typical properties, toxicity,
health hazards, exposure limits, safe handling advice, emergency treatment,
disposal, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental hazards. It also
identifies entries in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical
Substances (EINECS) for each main product group.

<p>The dossier series enables
companies to comply more easily with the EU's Existing Substances Regulation
which requires the provision of all available data on substances manufactured
in, or imported into, the EU.<br

The latest in the series, to be published shortly, is called Gas Oils
(diesel fuels/heating oils). These middle distillates are used mainly in
blending fuels for use in diesel engines and for domestic and industrial
heating. CONCAWE has identified 68 gas oil entries in EINECS that can be
used to blend the fuels covered by this dossier. They are grouped into four
generic types: straight run, cracked, vacuum and other. The typical concentrations
of each needed to produce the three main types of fuel (automotive diesel,
heating oil and marine gas oil) are listed in the table below. The typical
properties of the three main fuel types are listed in the table. This dossier
does not cover heavy vacuum gas oil components.

The dossier provides detailed data on the many studies that have been made
on the acute and sub-acute toxicity of these fuels when ingested by mouth,
inhaled or after skin contact. It also reviews the data on skin and eye
irritancy, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and reprotoxicity.
The toxicity chapter alone cites 66 references. The effects on human health
are summarized with the conclusion that, under normal conditions of storage,
handling and use as fuels, gas oils do not present a risk to health, providing
regular repeated skin contact is avoided. Special care is needed when gas
oils are used as solvents, or where repeated skin contact is possible.<BR>

The final chapter concerns the effects of gas oils on the environment. The
chapter concludes: 'If gas oil is released to the environment, it will be
subject to a number of loss processes. Lighter components will evaporate
and be photo-oxidized by atmospheric reaction with OH radicals. Higher molecular
weight components may also be subject to photo-oxidation but will also adsorb
to soil and sediment. In aerobic soils and sediments most gas oil components
will be subject to biodegradation but under anaerobic conditions gas oils
are persistent. Gas oil components are predicted to bioaccumulate on the
basis of their high octanol/water partition (Kow) coefficients, but the
available literature suggests that organisms are able to metabolize gas
oil hydrocarbons. The aquatic toxicity data on gas oils indicate that acute
LL50/EL50 values* for aquatic organisms are in the range 1 to 100 mg/l.
However there are few available data generated using accepted protocols
for oil products and the current database should be interpreted with caution.'

<TT>CONCAWE has started to collect information on the <BR>

a good and improving safety performance.<BR>
</TT></TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER>
<BR>

<center><TABLE border=0 width=80%><TR><TD align=left> <BR>

<P>For many years, CONCAWE has collected a wide range of statistics on various
aspects of the operations of the downstream oil industry but, until now,
it has not collected information on personal accidents in the operations
of member companies. It was felt that such an exercise would be worthwhile
so that companies could compare their performance against others and hopefully
to confirm the belief that the downstream oil industry was a good safety
performer despite the hazards intrinsic to many of its operations. This
belief has in no way led to a sense of complacency in the industry, and
considerable effort is expended on improving safety, and reducing the number
of accidents to as low as is reasonably possible.<BR>
<BR>
To collect this information, a task force was established under the Safety
Management Group. This group first agreed definitions of the parameters
to be measured. Some of these are described in Figure 1. This was as not
as easy as it sounds. Not all companies collect the same statistics, and
their definitions often differ from those used in the survey, often because
different countries have different accident reporting requirements. However,
companies were encouraged to submit what data they had in the knowledge
that they might not all be completely compatible. It was` felt that any
inaccuracies in the data caused by this would be slight.<BR>
<BR>
For this first exercise, companies were asked for data for the two years
1993 and 1994. In all, sixteen companies responded, and it was notable that
the majority of these were willing to allow their data to be shared openly
with the other companies. This free exchange indicates that they felt that
they could both learn from the experience of others, and help other companies
even though they are their competitors. <BR><br>

The response to this survey was good considering that this was a first attempt.
The sixteen member companies that responded were approximately half of the
CONCAWE membership. In terms of throughput, however, this represents a large
majority of the refining industry in Europe. The survey covered marketing
operations (which includes all non-refining activities including 'Head Office')
personnel as well as refineries and also included contract staff as well
as own employees. To take account of the fact that not all companies could
supply data in all of the sections, the results are expressed in terms of
frequencies per hours worked. <BR><br>

<BR><br>
Overall, the reported hours worked were over 300 million with an overall
Lost Workday Injury Frequency (LWIF) of 3.3 in 1994. To put this into perspective,
an 'average' oil industry worker only has a one in four chance of having
to lose a days work through an injury at work throughout his working life.
The performance of each company varied widely around the average as shown
in Figure 2. Although some of these differences are real, some are statistical,
as an accident involving a few workers can result in a high LWIF where the
work population is small. In most cases, the 'best' performance was a frequency
of 0.<BR><br>

<center><tt>Figure 3<br>
In most cases, the 1994 statistics were better than for 1993 with the exception
of fatalities which were increased by one tragic accident.</tt></center>
<BR><br>
The results for the various categories of workers are shown in Figure 3.
Perhaps the most striking aspect of this figure is the consistency of these
averaged reported LWIF. All lie within the range 3 to 5, with little difference
between manufacturing and marketing operations, and between company staff
(employees) and contract labour. There has been a trend over recent years
for more and more of oil industry activities to be carried out by specialist
contractors and there has been a fear that this could lead to poorer safety
performance. Although this fear seems justified in some of the 'worst' cases,
overall, the average incidence was very similar. Member companies are taking
great strides to ensure that contracting companies are applying the same
high standards as themselves.<BR>
<BR>
There was one more fatality (at 19) in 1994 than 1993. However, the number
of these is so small in any one year that it is not a reliable indicator
of safety performance. In fact the 1994 figure would only have been about
half of that in 1993 if it had not been for the tragic loss of nine staff
from one company who were travelling as passengers on the ferry Estonia
when she sank. Over the two years, only about one third of the fatalities
were in the refining area of the industry. Of those on the marketing side,
the major cause was road accidents. All of the average LWIF were lower in
1994 than 1993. Whilst this is satisfying, two years is far too short a
period to indicate a trend. For this reason CONCAWE intends to continue,
and hopefully extend this survey in future years.

CONCAWE's oil pipelines<BR>
database enlargement</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<TT>The oil pipelines inventory monitored by CONCAWE has expanded <BR>
to incorporate non-commercially owned pipelines <BR>
and a step out eastwards is being investigated. 
</TT></CENTER><BR><BR>
<BR>
<P>Since 1971, CONCAWE has collected spillage performance information on
oil industry owned cross-country oil pipelines in OECD Europe. CONCAWE has
also collected data on several pipeline systems which, originally, were
exclusively used for government purposes and which, over time, have opened
up their operations to transport oil products on a commercial basis. The
operators of these pipelines, which we have called the 'non-commercially
owned', have in fact been represented in CONCAWE's Oil Pipelines Management
Group (OPMG) almost since its inception in 1971. Thus the benefits of shared
experience and new developments on integrity management have always been
available to all categories of oil pipeline operators in OECD Europe. However,
in the past CONCAWE's published performance statistics have not included
the non-commercially owned sector.<BR>
<BR>
The OPMG and the pipeline operators concerned recently took the decision
to change this status quo and to report all of the data that were available
to CONCAWE, thus improving the transparency and credibility of what CONCAWE
reports. Thus the possibility no longer exists for a non oil industry oil
pipeline to have a spillage which features in the media but which does not
get reported by CONCAWE.<BR>
<BR>
The non-commercially owned pipeline inventory, annual spillage performance
data and intelligence pig inspection records have been retroactively incorporated
in CONCAWE's computerized database commencing from year 1988. This has added
some 175 pipeline sections totalling about 9200 kilometres in length thus
increasing the records inventory from 21.6 to 30.8 thousand kilometres.
The spillage incidences calculated before and after these inclusions average
out at similar figures, indicating that the integrity of the non-commercially
owned pipelines is comparable with the oil industry ones.<BR>
<BR>
The 1994 spillage performance has been reported in CONCAWE Report No. 4/95.
There were 11 spillages in 1994 resulting in a gross spillage of some 2400
m3 which, after clean-up, resulted in a net loss of oil into the environment
of 2000 m3, about half of which was consumed when an accidental fire resulted.
In 1994, the unconsumed part of the net loss matched the lowest ever recorded
loss into the environment and the spillage frequency at 0.36 spillages per
year per 1000 km of pipeline continues the long-term trend of improving
performance recorded since 1971.<BR>
<BR>
CONCAWE is now considering how to incorporate the Hungarian oil pipeline
system which extends to roughly 2000 km. The oil company MOL, CONCAWE's
recently-gained associate member, has started to collect the required data.
The collection of data for other eastern European countries is under investigation.

<b><CENTER>MANAGEMENT GROUPS</B></CENTER>
<P>Dr Hermann Sch&auml;fer (Mobil) retired at the end of last year and his
position as Chairman of the Oil Pipelines Management Group has been taken
over by Mr Cam Macara (Shell). The other Management Group Chairmen are unchanged
(see CONCAWE Review, Volume 3, Number 1, April 1994). <BR>

<center><B>SECRETARIAT</B></CENTER>

<P>After a long period of stability, a number of changes of personnel are
taking place in the Secretariat.<BR>
<BR>
Denis Lyons, who has been with the Secretariat for 10 years, has recently
taken early retirement. Over these years, Denis has been responsible for
both the Refining Planning function and for overseeing CONCAWE publications.
In this latter role he has had the job of principal editor for the CONCAWE
Review, successfully published since early 1992. Mr Kees van Leeuwen (Shell)
is taking over as Technical Coordinator, Publications and Refining Planning.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Hutcheson will also be taking early retirement after more than six
years as Technical Coordinator for Automotive Emissions activities. In this
role, he has overseen a large proportion of CONCAWE's research budget and
been instrumental in producing many authoritative reports on the subject
including CONCAWE's well-received encyclopedia on auto fuels and vehicle
emissions regulations. Roger will hand over to Dr Peter Heinze (Mobil) at
the end of September.<BR>
<BR>
Les White has been with CONCAWE for six years as the Technical Coordinator
for Air Quality matters. He will shortly be returning to a post in Esso.
Over the last couple of years, Les has been the kingpin of CONCAWE's contribution
to the Auto Oil Programme in which he has worked closely with our sister
organization, EUROPIA. His replacement is Dr Suzie Baverstock (BP).<BR>
<BR>
The three colleagues will be sorely missed by the other members of the Secretariat
but we have been fortunate to have found excellent replacements. We wish
all of them well in their future endeavours.<BR>
<BR>
The new Secretariat following these changes is shown in the Table below.<BR>

to reduce CO and benzene concentrations to levels even further below the
air quality targets. (London represents more than 80 per cent of European
cities; Athens is worst case).</FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<P>The yellow columns in Figures 2 (a, c and d) show the predicted reductions
in NOx, CO and benzene for the year 2010 given already-agreed measures,
for example, the introduction of catalyst cars. It can be seen that the
air quality targets for CO and benzene are met in both London and Athens
before the year 2000 with already-agreed measures. However, it is also
clear that further measures are still required to meet the air quality
targets for NOx and PM10 in 2010. </P>

<P><I>With proposed Auto/Oil Programme measures</I><B><TT> <BR>
</TT></B>A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefully
examined and their individual cost-effectiveness calculated and ranked.
Emission reduction measures were selected, first to attain the NOx air
quality target, secondly the PM10 target, and thirdly the ozone target.
It was the ozone target which proved the most difficult challenge and brought
about the selection of the most stringent measures (see following article
for more details on the measures and on ozone). It must be noted that these
predictions of the future assume that the emission reductions achieved
in the transport sector are matched by those from the stationary sector.</P>

<P>Although the outlook for London (i.e. 80 per cent of urban population)
looks favourable, Figures 2a and 2b also show that the stringent air quality
targets are still not met for NOx, PM10 and benzene in the worst case city
(Athens). This is primarily due to the existing traffic problems in Athens
and the very slow turnover in the car fleet. This means that catalyst-equipped
cars will be slow to penetrate the Athens car fleet. Even if all possible
Auto/Oil Programme measures are applied, Athens still would not meet these
air quality targets. A clear outcome from the Auto/Oil Programme was that,
for such special circumstances, the Europe-wide Auto/Oil measures will
need to be supplemented by local measures such as city traffic management
programmes and early vehicle-scrappage schemes. Clearly it would not be
sensible or cost-effective to mandate measures across Europe to try to
solve the local problem in Athens. The Commissions proposal follows this
line of thinking. </P>

<P>For further information on the Auto/Oil Programme air quality study,
please refer to the Report of Sub-Group 2 published by DGXI entitled <I>Air
Quality Report of the Auto/Oil Programme. </I></P>

ALREADY-AGREED MEASURES </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>A great deal of environmental legislation is already agreed at either
the European or National level, but is not yet fully implemented. Legislative
measures that affect emissions of ozoneforming chemicals were examined
and included in the EMEP modelling to predict future air quality. The 'do
nothing more' picture for 2010 is certainly encouraging. Figure 1b gives
the Auto/Oil Programme's predictions for the year 2010 given already-agreed
measures. The exceedances of the 99 percentile 180 &#181;g/m3 hourly value
are much reduced but still centred in northern Europe. These already-agreed
measures would bring the EU into 99 percentile compliance with, for example,
the alert threshold 1-hour standard of 240 &#181;g/m3 used in Germany.
</P>

<P>More would need to be done to reach the ambitious goal of 180 &#181;g/m3
in 2010. The EMEP modelling work showed that a 70 per cent reduction in
emissions of ozone-forming chemicals (NOx and VOCs) was needed from both
mobile and stationary sources (Figure 3a and 3b). </P>

<P>A wide range of different emission reduction measures were carefully
examined which covered the following: </P>

<UL>
<LI>improved vehicle technology; </LI>

<LI>improved fuel quality; </LI>

<LI>better vehicle maintenance and annual inspection tests; and </LI>

<LI>local initiatives such as road pricing and public transport.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The individual cost-effectiveness of each measure was then calculated
and ranked (Figure 4). Then the most cost-effective emission reduction
measures were selected, first to attain the NOx air quality target, secondly
the particulate matter target, and thirdly the ozone target. It was the
ozone target which proved the most difficult to achieve and brought about
the selection of the most stringent emission control measures. </P>

<P>Figure 1c shows the effects of the Auto/Oil Programme measures on ozone
concentrations, provided the precursor emission reductions achieved in
the transport sector from 1990 are matched by those from the stationary
sector. Figures 1d, 3a and 3b all reinforce the need for equivalent measures
from stationary sources. There would be widespread exceedances of the ozone
air quality target in 2010 without these equivalent measures. </P>

<P>For 2005, the European Commission has proposed a second set of even
more stringent standards for vehicles, and a study to determine the need
for further tightening of fuel measures in 2005. This 'second step', with
the most severe measures on fuels, has a minimum impact on air quality
in 2010. This is demonstrated in Figures 3a and 3b, but the impact on overall
costs is very high. A far more certain and necessary path to attaining
air quality targets in Europe is to tackle the emissions from stationary
sources in a cost-effective way. CONCAWE has already expressed its willingness
to help explore the cost-effectiveness of measures to reduce oil industry
stationary source emissions to meet air quality targets and is encouraging
other industry sectors to follow suit. </P>

<H1> PISCES Upgrade Facility at UC-San Diego </H1>	
</center>

The PISCES-Upgrade device is a plasma facing component
test facility.  The scope of the technical research encompasses erosion and
redeposition, impurity transport, heat removal, and the structural integrity of
components cyclically exposed to a plasma environment.  The facility provides a
plasma source in an open geometry that permits and encourages the investigation
of innovative divertor concepts.  PISCES-Upgrade, using the same reflex arc
technology as PISCES-B, is designed to operate steady-state at the following
plasma parameters: ne = 1 x 10<sup>20</sup> m<sup>-3</sup>, Te = 5-30 eV, Ti =
1-20 eV.  Controllable heat loads of up to 35 MW/m<sup>2</sup> will be
delivered over a variable target area of 60-150 cm<sup>2</sup>.<p>

Welcome to the Original Unofficial Metrolink Information System.  We've started
making some improvements to the system.  First, each route now has its own
page, accessible by the navigation bar above or the links below.  On each page,
there are links to information about each station, including a rudimentary
interface to the <a href="http://sunbox.goventura.org/transit.html">Transtar
Transit Routing System</a>.<p>

<b>Notice to Riders:</b> Effective January 31, 1997, Terminal Tower at Los
Angeles Union Station was closed and the interlocking plant disconnected. 
Switches are now manually controlled while the track and signaling systems are
upgraded.  Some delays to arriving and departing trains is expected.
<b>When departing from Los Angeles Union Station, verify the track that your train
is on.  Many changes to track assignments will occur during construction.</b>
  When the
upgrade is complete, signals and switches out of Los Angeles Union Station will
be remotely controlled from Metrolink's dispatching facility.<p>

<h1>Experimental Program Overview</h1>
</center>

Fusion reactions occur in plasma, a state of matter which exists when the
temperature of a gas becomes so hot that the electrons literally "boil off." 
To harness the energy released by fusion, key challenges for
<a href="http://wwwofe.er.doe.gov">fusion research</a>
are to confine these plasmas by magnetic fields and to control the interactions
with the surrounding walls.  <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">UC San Diego</a> 
participates in national and
international collaborations on large plasma confinement experiments and also
operates the leading facilities in the world for studying the interaction of
plasma with materials.  While the field of plasma physics has been nurtured in
large part by the world's fusion programs, plasmas have found widespread
applications in manufacturing of advanced materials and microelectronic chips,
and in the processing of waste materials.<p>

<h2>PISCES-B Plasma-Surface Interaction Research</h2>

PISCES-B is the leading facility in the U. S. for studies of fusion plasma
interactions with materials.  The facility provides steady-state simulation of
the boundary regions in a burning fusion reactor, with a maximum plasma density
of 2.5 x 10^19/m^3 in deuterium and temperatures in the range of 5 - 30 million
degrees centigrade.  One of the unique features of the facility is a
fully-qualified safety enclosure for performing tests of plasma interactions
with beryllium - one of the leading materials for the plasma-facing walls.<P>

<h2>Plasma Boundary Layer Physics and PISCES-A</h2>

<a href="/www/pisces/piscesa-desc.html">PISCES-A</a> is a plasma wind tunnel used in investigations of atomic processes and
plasma turbulence.  PISCES-A creates plasma conditions in the laboratory
simulating the boundary plasma in a steady-state fusion power plant.  It also
serves as a test bed for validating theory and models which are used in the
design of fusion facilities such as <a href="http://iter.ucsd.edu">ITER</a>.<P>

<b>Research Interests</b><p>

Experimental studies of plasma-materials interactions and boundary layer  
plasma physics. Present research topics include the erosion and deuterium 
retention behavior of beryllium when it is exposed to 
<a href="http://www.iterus.org">ITER</a> relevant plasma 
conditions in the PISCES-B linear plasma device. Plasma physics research 
includes the role of electric fields on transport in the boundary layer, 
investigation of magnetic sheath formation and RF ion heating.<p>

Other areas of interest include the design and optimization of plasma sources.
These efforts have culminated in the fabrication of the new, 800kW, 
<a href="http://pisces.ucsd.edu/~rdoerner/cusp.html">PISCES-Upgrade</a> plasma source, which is under construction in collaboration 
with <a href="http://www.mdc.com">McDonnell Douglas Aerospace</a>.<p>

<b>Research Interests</b><p>

Experimental studies of electrostatic plasma 
turbulence in both the edge of tokamaks 
(<a href="http://fusion.gat.com">DIII-D</a>) and 
linear plasma devices 
(<a href="http://pisces.ucsd.edu/www/pisces/piscesa_desc.html">PISCES-A</a>).
  We have observed that the levels of electrostatic turbulence
and the turbulent particle transport across the magnetic field can be modified by changing the
strength and profile of the electric field in the plasma.<p>

In the next six months, we will be installing a temperature fluctuation diagnostic extension
to the midplane scanning probe on the DIII-D tokamak.  Correlated measurements of the fluctuations
in the electron temperature with fluctuations in the floating potential of the plasma will 
provide an estimate of the fluctuation of the plasma space potential.  Measuring this at two spatial
locations will allow for the fluctuating electric field and this data, correlated with the 
fluctuating plasma density, allows for an estimate of the cross field particle transport.<p>

<b>Research Interests</b><p>

Rick, an experimental plasma physicist in the Fusion Energy Research Program at the University of California, San Diego, leads a team of UCSD scientists researching plasma edge and divertor physics in the Doublet III-D tokamak at General Atomics in La Jolla, CA. He specializes in investigation of plasma turbulence and transport using Langmuir probes. A description of this work, suitable for non-plasma physicists, is available on the World Wide Web at: 
<a href="http://fusion.gat.com/DNT/DNT21.htm">
http://fusion.gat.com/DNT/DNT21.htm</a>. Rick has considerable experience working in large international collaborations, including a two-year assignment to the TEXTOR tokamak in Juelich, Germany (1988-89). <br>
<br>
Rick's research interests also include space plasma physics, in particular magnetic reconnection, solar coronal heating, and acceleration of the solar wind. <br>
<br>
Rick is active in employment and career development issues for physicists as a participant in the Young Scientists Network (archives at: 
<a href=" http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/ysn/">
http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/ysn/</a>) and as a steering committee member for the Forum on Careers and Professional Development of the American Physical Society. Rick is interested in the use of on-line technology in job placement and career development, and has contributed to the Careers Plus supplement of APS News (April, 1996) and the Careers Plus WWW site of the American Physical Society (
<a href=" http://aps.org/jobs/careerplus/">http://aps.org/jobs/careerplus/</a>) on this topic.<br>

This is an unofficial Coaster information site.  While every effort is made to transcribe
the information on schedules and services, this site, its employees, and the University

<a name="OldTown"><h2>Old Town Transit Center</h2></a>

San Diego Trolley and San Diego Transit buses have recently joined the Coaster and
are now serving the Old Town Transit Center (OTTC).  The OTTC is the terminus for
San Diego Trolley's new 3.2 mile extension from downtown San Diego to Old Town. 
The extension joins the Trolley's existing South Line, renamed the North-South Line,
a 19.3 mile light rail line that runs from the OTTC to the San Ysidro Station at
the U. S. International Border with Mexico.<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Old Town Transit Center - A Regional Hub.</b> This new multi-modal transit
center provides connections between the San Diego Trolley (North-South and East Lines),
10 bus routes, and Coaster trains.  Taxi and hotel shuttles are also available, as
well as bicycle lockers, an approximate 500 space parking lot for State Park and
transit patrons, and a 110 foot long passageway that allows pedestrians to travel
safely underneath the tracks.</li>
<li><b>San Diego Trolley Service.</b> The new line extends service from the County
Center/Little Italy station to the OTTC. The new line includes three stations: Middletown/Palm
Street, Washington Street, and the OTTC. Service operates from approximately 4:50AM
to about midnight.  On weekdays, trains operate every 10 minutes during rush hours

<h2>Impurity Transport in a Simulated Gas Target Divertor </H2>
<I>L.M. Blush, L. Schmitz, B. Merriman, S. Luckhardt, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, UC-San Diego)</I><P>
<P>Previous experiments in the PISCES-A linear plasma device ( n < 3x10^19 m^-3, kTe < 20 eV) have indicated enhanced retention of impurities near the target in a simulated gas target
divertor as compared to a high recycling divertor regime. Preliminary impurity transport modeling, using a 1 1/2-D fluid code, shows that the impurities are impeded from transporting away from the simulated target by friction with both the neutral and ionized hydrogen. To further investigate the mechanisms of impurity transport, we are upgrading the PISCES-A experimental arrangement to include strong differential pumping to isolate the plasma source from the gas target region. This will allow us to seed the background hydrogen plasma with higher concentrations of impurities and investigate a regime dominated by impurity radiation. We are presently developing a spectroscopic detection system to simultaneously measure axial impurity density profiles of up to three charge states. This will provide us with more detailed experimental information for comparison to our impurity transport fluid modeling code.<P>This work supported by US-DoE contract DE-FG03-95ER-54301. <P>

<H2>Beryllium Dust Generation in PISCES-B Due to Plasma-Material Interactions</H2>
<I>R. Doerner, C. Mays, Y. Hirooka, S.C. Luckhardt, C.F. Sze, J. Won, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, U.C. San Diego)</I>
<P>

<P>The PISCES-B device has started plasma-beryllium experiments in its new
location at U.C. San Diego. An improved controlled atmosphere enclosure was
constructed to assure safe operation with beryllium materials. In the
previous experimental campaign we found that a total of 600 mg of beryllium
had been eroded during materials tests. This provided us with a unique
opportunity to investigate the lost beryllium. Swipe sampling and vacuum
sampling of the PISCES-B vacuum chamber revealed that 3% of the eroded
beryllium resided as uniformly distributed loose dust within the vacuum
chamber. An additional 33% of the eroded beryllium was coated onto the
chamber wall. Filtering through a series of decreasing pore size meshes
revealed a uniform distribution of particle sizes in the respirable range
(between 10mm - 0.1mm), fewer larger particles (>50mm) were observed.

<H2>Poloidal Ion Flow Modification and Reduction of Radial Particle Transport in PISCES-A</H2>
<I>R.D. Lehmer, L. Schmitz, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, UC-San Diego)</I>
<P>

<P>Increases in the sheared 
edge electric field and poloidal ion flow have been observed
to coincide with the L to H transition and the formation of a radial transport
barrier in tokamaks. Experiments in the
PISCES-A linear reflex arc discharge device
study the effect of the radial electric field on the plasma turbulence and the
fluctuation-induced radial particle transport. 
When the electric field layer width is on the
order of the ion Larmor radius (l_E \approx 1-2 \rho_i), the poloidal
ion flow induced by the electric field profile is significantly modified
from the E \times B drift speed. Under these conditions, 
the poloidal ion rotation increases as the electric field layer width 
increases. A radial transport barrier forms if the magnitude of the 
poloidal ion rotation is substantially increased by widening the electric 
field layer.
Modeling of the poloidal ion flow profile is consistent with the experimental
measurement of the phase velocity of coherent structures.
 Detailed, two-dimensional
measurements of the spatial size and radial and poloidal propagation of
coherent structures observed in the plasma will also be presented.

<h2>Investigation of Thin Film Formation and Hydrogen Retention in a Be/C/W Fusion Environment</H2>
<I>F.C. Sze, R. Doerner, J. Won, Y. Hirooka, S.C. Luckhardt, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, University of California, San Diego)</I>
<P><P>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) design makes use of three plasma facing materials: beryllium, carbon, and tungsten. In this paper we examine plasma-materials effects resulting from the mixtures of these elements. In our earlier beryllium-plasma interaction experiments in PISCES-B, we found that thin film formation, due to carbon and other plasma impurities, can increase the erosion lifetime of beryllium by a factor of four or more [J. Won, et al. submitted to J. Vac. Sci. Technology]. In this paper we present initial investigations of plasma deposited beryllium onto carbon/tungsten mixture targets in PISCES-B. Surface microanalysis data and measurements of hydrogen retention as a result of codeposition will be reported.  This work is supported by USDOE under grant DE-FG03-95ER-54301.<P>

<H2>Deuterium Release from Plasma-Bombarded Beryllium During Thermal Desorption</H2>
<I>J. Won, R. Doerner, S.C. Luckhardt, F.C. Sze, R.W. Conn (Fusion Energy Research Program, U.C. San Diego)</I>
<P>

<P>Understanding hydrogen retention is crucial to estimating the tritium
inventory in a fusion reactor and to predicting outgassing and recycling.
The retention of hydrogen isotopes in plasma-facing components is governed
by diffusion, trapping and desorption, with proper account taken of the role
of the incident plasma flux and ion bombarding energy. In PISCES-B experiments 
beryllium metallic samples were exposed to steady-state, high-flux deuterium
plasmas, and afterwards a set of thermal desorption experiments were carried
out on the beryllium samples. Importantly, these data show two deuterium
(D2) release peaks occuring at approximately 340 C. and 470 C. respectively.
We interpret this spectrum in terms of a surface component and a bulk
component. Analytical modeling of the diffusion data will be presented.

The controllermodule can be ganged with up to 4 digitizer modules, each with 4 channelsfor a grand total of 16 channels per controller (using only 5 slots of crate).Control modules can handle 16 Mega-Sample per channel. They can run up to40 Mega-Samples per second. An external clock input is also available whichwill allow multipule controllers to be ganged together or to allow externallycontrol burst mode digitizing.<BR><BR>The Digitizer module is comprised of 2 daughter cards, the digitizer boardand the memory board. Both boards are set up for 16 bit quantization pathwaysgiving the capability to expand to 16 bit data. However, the system runningtoday only has 12 bit digitizer chips. To expand to 12 or 16 bits wouldrequire that this board be redesigned. The memory board is designed for16 bit data storage. It can hold enough RAMs to hold 512K samples per channelat 40MSPS. The system today only has 256K samples per channel of 12 bitwide RAM with fast enough access speed to sample at 20MSPS. All of the RAMis in sockets so upgrading to 512K samples per channel at 40MSPS is easy.To upgrade to 16 Mega-sample per channel would require that the board beredesigned.<BR><BR>The price of building the system (excluding design time) was far less thanthat of purchasing anyting from LeCroy or KineticSystems. The controllermodules were around $1K and the digitizer modules were around $4K incluedingmemory. This is due to the fact that this system fills a gap in thier productline. Their digitizers go up to the low-hundreds of KHz. and their transientwaveform digitizers start at around 100 MHz. <BR><BR>As part of the documentation process, all details of opperation are containedin the <A HREF="manual.html">programmer's manual </A>.<BR><BR><BR>The pictures could be better, but they were taken with a Apple Quicktake150 with a closeup lens.<BR><BR><A HREF="/~rlehmer/camac/connector.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/camac/connector.jpg"WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>High densityconnectors to pass control and address signals.<BR><BR><A HREF="/~rlehmer/camac/digitizers.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/camac/digitizers.jpg"WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="180" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Close-up ofdigitizer daughter card.<BR><BR><A HREF="/~rlehmer/camac/front.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/camac/front.jpg"WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Two 4 channeldigitizer boards with a controller board.<BR><BR><A HREF="/~rlehmer/camac/rearview.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/camac/rearview.jpg"WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Rear viewof a controller board.<BR><BR></BODY></HTML>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

The related blurb(less than an article) is really meaninless blab.  It implies that Berylliumwill replace the magnetic bottle which contains the plasma when in reality,the magnetic bottle is still very necessary.   The Beryllium will line thewall of the vacuum vessel where it will be subjected to the intense energyemission from the plasma.  The plasma will also just graze parts of theBeryllium wall which will help contain the plama (create a stable flow). Thus the confussion on the part of the magazine regarding containment.<BR><A HREF="pictures/bework/suit.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/bework/suitie.jpg"WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="113" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>See Greg work.<BR><BR><A HREF="pictures/bework/eyes.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/bework/eyesie.jpg"WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="190" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Work, Greg,Work.<BR><BR><A HREF="pictures/bework/control.jpg"><IMG SRC="pictures/bework/controlie.jpg"WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="183" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Although,Look at that great touchscreen control program.<BR><BR>Back to <A HREF="home.html">Home</A> </BODY></HTML>                                                                                                                                       

<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The most recent design of the ITER (International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor) tokamak divertor and first wall utilizes a variety of
materials, such as beryllium, carbon, and tungsten.<sup>1,2</sup> Under plasma
operation, these materials will be eroded and redeposited resulting in
plasma-facing surfaces consisting of complex materials comprised of all three
components, hydrides, and other related compounds. Therefore, the physical
properties of such mixed materials are of great interest for ITER.  In this
report, we present the results of a literature search for data on the physical
properties of binary mixtures of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten. This search
was done using the MELVYL INSPEC database. The results of the search including
author list, titles, and abstracts of the extracted articles are compiled here.
Further, we present a compilation of journal citations on beryllium materials
experiments and mixed materials experiments in tokamaks.<p>

Introduction</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	It is well known that the surface material of the inner walls and of
plasma-facing components in fusion experiments is a mixed material, often
called "tokamakium" (See Chapter 2). This surface layer is the result of
material transport due to sputter-erosion, melting, evaporation, etc..
Moreover, the recent design of the ITER tokamak divertor includes three
different materials, i.e., beryllium, carbon and tungsten.<sup>1,2</sup><p>
	To respond to the urgent need for information about the properties of mixed
surface-layer materials, a literature search has been performed using the
MELVYL INSPEC database. This database has 1,396,046 citations indexed by the
Institution of Electrical Engineers from over 4000 journals and other
publications in physics, electronics, and computing. We examined the database
for papers on mixed materials published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95. Because we
were interested in the mixed materials of beryllium, carbon, and tungsten, the
key words, such as "beryllium, carbon", "beryllium, tungsten", and "carbon,
tungsten" were used. The following table shows the number of papers that have
been found using these commands.<p>

<p>
The numbers indicate that tungsten and carbon are widely used materials in the
field of thin film. We examined the titles and abstracts of these papers and
selected those having relevant data. In the following report, we have
classified these papers according to subject area and listed the bibliographic
information and abstracts.<p>

Thermal absorption and desorption of deuterium in beryllium and beryllium

<p>
Abstract: Thermal desorption measurements have been made on high purity
beryllium samples loaded with deuterium by thermal absorption in 13.3 kPa of
D/sub 2/ gas at 773 K. The saturation content of deuterium in the Be was
determined to be 6.3 appm. Rutherford backscattering analysis indicated that
the surface oxide grew significantly during the experiments, even in a vacuum
of &lt;10/sup -5/ Pa. In order to determine deuterium solubility in BeO, a
sample was oxidised in air for 16 h at 1073 K prior to deuterium loading. The
deuterium content was estimated by /sup 3/He-D nuclear reaction analysis as
approximately 200 appm. From attempts to fit previously published data using
diffusion models, it is concluded that surface recombination is unlikely to be
an important factor, whereas surface oxide and trapping effects significantly
delay the release of deuterium from Be and BeO.<p>

<p>
Abstract: Deuterium thermal absorption and desorption experiments were
conducted in high-purity Be, BeO and Be/sub 2/C samples. Ion-beam analysis was
used to measure the surface contamination and near-surface deuterium
concentration (up to depths of 500 nm). For bulk BeO the deuterium solubility
is small, with S approximately=10/sup 18/ exp(-0.8 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)/sup
1/2/, possibly indicative of the formation of hydroxide bonds; the diffusivity
is &gt;or=7*10/sup -5/ exp(-2.1 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s. In deliberately corroded Be
samples the deuterium surface concentration was about 0.02 at.% where there was
little or no carbon contamination, and up to 1.6 at.% when the carbon and
oxygen contents were similar. This implies the presence of large concentrations
of trapped deuterium at or near the surface. The approximate solubility of bulk
Be/sub 2/C samples was estimated as 3.4*10/sup 27/exp(-0.58 eV/kT) at/m/sup
3/(Pa)/sup 1/2/. The solubility for deuterium in bulk Be was found to be
7*10/sup 27/exp(-1.0 eV/kT) at/m/sup 3/(Pa)1/2 and the bulk diffusivity is
8*10/sup -9/ exp(-0.36 eV/kT) m/sup 2//s.<p>

Abstract: Results of measurements of sticking coefficients of nitrogen,
hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon monoxide on beryllium thick films at room
temperature are described. Beryllium was vapor deposited onto glass substrates
and the sticking coefficient of the impinging gas molecules was measured as a
function of quantity adsorbed. No adsorption was observed with either nitrogen
or hydrogen. A sticking coefficient of 0.4 for oxygen was measured with a total
coverage of 8.4*10/sup 14/ molecules/cm/sup 2/. Carbon monoxide displayed some
pressure dependence and the initial sticking coefficient was found to be
roughly proportional to the square root of the pressure. In the 10/sup -8/ Torr
range a sticking coefficient of 0.1 was measured with a total coverage of
4.0*10/sup 13/ molecules/cm/sup 2/; in the 10/sup -7/ Torr range a sticking
coefficient of 0.5 was measured with a total coverage of 2.4*10/sup 14/

Abstract: The specific electrical resistances of beryllium borides increases
regularly with increasing relative content of boron from values characteristic
of metallic conductors in the lower borides, to values characteristic of
insulators in the higher borides. The structure and electrophysical properties
of the lower borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern of beryllium
bonds, basically of the metallic type. The structure and electrophysical
properties of the higher borides of beryllium are determined by the pattern of
the boron bonds of the covalent type. Between the higher- energy electron
configurations of beryllium and the electron configurations of boron there is
an energy gap which causes the insulating properties. The higher beryllium
borocarbide, bec/sub 2/b/sub 12/, is close to b/sub 4/c in structure, hardness
and electrical properties. The lower beryllium borocarbide bec/sub 2/b2 has
semi-metallic properties.<p>

Abstract: Carbon migration was investigated in polycrystalline beryllium with
grain size of 56 microns. The magnitude of the effective charges in beryllium
at 1273, 1373 and 1473 degrees K were 26.5, 0.154 and 0.264 resp. The inherent
charge of the carbon in beryllium was calculated in an approximation to a
two-region model of the solid (atom charge=2 for the range 1373-1473 degrees
K). It is assumed that solid-solution decompositions may exist in the
beryllium-carbon system.<p>

Abstract: The parameters of the temperature dependences of the coefficients of

differing degrees of purity are determined by layer-by-layer radiometric
analysis using the /sup 14/C isotope. The linearity of the relationship between

Abstract: Attempts, with independent estimates, to resolve the existing
discrepancies and identify with greater confidence the mechanism of diffusion
of C in Be. For this purpose the authors have carried out additional
measurements of the dependences of the dislocation damping on the amplitude of
deformation and the temperature for samples of powdered and cast Be, containing
0.1 wt.% each of Fe and C as the main impurities. The experimental results are
plotted as ln tan alpha vs. T/sup -1/ in accordance with the theory of
dislocation damping. On the basis of an analysis of the interaction of
dislocations with point defects, it is established that, upon heating to 470K,
thermal unpinning of dislocations takes place in Be, and, conversely, at higher
temperatures (470-740K), dislocations become effectively pinned by dissolved
impurities.\<p>

Abstract: Determines the kinetics of Be/sub 2/C formation. An interfacial
reaction between amorphous carbon and beryllium takes place at about 450
degrees C. The reaction results in the formation of beryllium carbide, Be/sub
2/C. Heat treatments of C/Be couples at temperatures higher than 450 degrees C
cause the growth of the carbide layer. The growth is apparently controlled by
the diffusion of Be in the carbide.<p>

Abstract: Enhanced diffusion of carbon is observed to be produced during
annealing of silicon at 900 degrees C under conditions of surface oxidation and
phosphorus in-diffusion. Silicon containing high concentrations of carbon (
approximately 9*10/sup 17//cm/sup 3/ substitutional) and varying levels of
interstitial oxygen and differing defect concentrations has been studied.
Diffusion coefficient enhancement over the value found for an anneal in an
inert ambient is by a factor of three during oxidation and a factor of forty
with phosphorus in-diffusion. Carbon accumulation takes place in a region
0.3-0.5 microns from the sample surface only under conditions of phosphorus
in-diffusion and is attributed to carbon precipitation. A model that assumes
interactions between silicon self-interstitials and the carbon can explain both
the enhanced diffusion and the carbon accumulation.<p>

Abstract: Diffusion of carbon into silicon was investigated between 1176 K and
1658 K by the radiotracer technique using precision grinding for serial
sectioning. Gaussian- or erfc-type penetration profiles were observed,
depending on the applied /sup 14/C-source technique. Diffusion coefficients
determined on virtually defect-free material, CZ wafers containing mainly
stacking faults and highly dislocated crystals agree within the experimental
accuracy. The data obey an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of
3.04 eV and a pre-exponential factor of 0.95.10/sup -4/ m/sup 2/s/sup -1/. The
results are discussed in terms of diffusion via interstitial-substitutional
exchange.<p>

investigated the radiation enhanced sublimation of these materials in
experiments at high temperatures up to 1850 K. Radiation-enhanced sublimation
can be avoided in boron carbide up to 1700 K under deuterium ion bombardment,
but not under carbon ion bombardment. This is interpreted as an effect of
material modification of the surface layer due to carbon enrichment.<p>

Abstract: Adsorption of beryllium on (110), (111) and (211) planes of
single-crystal of tungsten was studied using a probe-hole field electron
microscope (FEM). The dependence of the work function on the time of deposition
was measured for these planes. The average work function was determined as
well. On the (110) plane the work function varies regularly, i.e. it decreases
at low coverage, passes through minimum and saturates for a thick layer at the
value of 4.1 eV, which is that for bulk beryllium. On (111) and (211) planes
the work function increases for low coverage and saturates for thicker layer at
very high values which are 5.3 eV and 6 eV, respectively. The irregular
behaviour has to be connected with loose structure of these planes and small
atomic radius of beryllium.<p>

Abstract: The work function changes induced by the adsorption of beryllium on
W(211) were measured. It was found that the work function increases steeply in
initial stage of the adsorption reaching a local maximum at the coverage of 1/2
and saturates at approximately 3 monolayers. Starting from 1/2 of the beryllium
monolayer an additional peak appears in the spectrum of back-scattered
electrons ascribed as due to the excitation of plasma oscillations. Its energy
loss of 17.6 eV is distinctly higher than that corresponding to the surface
plasmon of bulk beryllium. The explanation of the observed phenomena is
proposed.<p>

plasmons have been excited within the Be adlayer at coverages less than one
monolayer. The loss spectra for Be layers adsorbed on the two crystal faces are
distinctly different. An explanation of observed phenomena is proposed.<p>

Abstract: Field emission energy distributions (FEED) have been measured for the
beryllium-tungsten (023) adsorption system over the 78-450K temperature range.
A temperature dependence of the normalized half-width, Delta /d, of FEED peaks
changed significantly due to beryllium adsorption; and the curve, Delta /d vs
p, for the Be/W adsorption system was identical in character to the calculated
curve based on the free electron (FE) model in contrast to the curve for the
clean tungsten surface. In the last part of this paper Gadzuk's theory of the
resonance-tunneling effect is applied to the beryllium atom on tungsten.
Experimental and theoretical curves of the enhancement factor R as a function
of energy have been discussed.<p>

process involving double layer formation.<p>

Abstract: The growth mode, work function, thermal desorption and structure of
Be films up to several layers in thickness on a W(110) surface are

first layer the bonding to the substrate is only slightly ionic, the bonding
between the adatoms probably at least in part via indirect electronic
interactions. Filling of the first layer proceeds by a sequence of
discontinuous structural transformations combined with changes of the
electronic properties of the deposit and of the adsorbate-substrate binding
forces.

Abstract: Electron beam induced carbon deposition on a polycrystalline tungsten

occurs from carbon monoxide, through dissociation of weakly held alpha-CO, and
also from carbon dioxide and methane. In each case the saturation coverage is
3.0-3.3*10/sup 15/ atoms cm/sup -2/, approaching the monolayer of the basal
plane of graphite. The Auger line shape indicates that the deposited layer is
graphitic in nature and incorporation of carbon into the graphite layer is
suggested to be rate determining.<p>

Abstract: Layered synthetic microstructures composed of alternate layers of
carbon and tungsten (prepared by triode sputtering) are analysed by Auger
electron spectroscopy. A superficial pollution by silica is observed. In the
multilayer, an in-depth contamination by oxygen is detected: a preferential
oxidation of tungsten relative to carbon is observed. The Auger depth profile
presents periodic and asymmetrical C and W waves. As LSM's were not annealed
this result is related purely to an effect of sputtering. A theoretical
approach based on the overlap of Gaussian distributions is proposed and agrees
fairly well with the experimental data.<p>

Abstract: Carbon coatings on the first wall and the shielding of the first wall
by graphite tiles effectively improve plasma parameters by reducing radiation
losses in the plasma. In this experiment, a fast in-situ coating method of low
atomic number materials by a compact vacuum-arc deposition gun was developed.
This method is useful for in-situ carbon coating on the first wall as well as
for in-situ regeneration of coatings on graphite tiles damaged through plasma
wall interactions or by high heat loads from the plasma. Thick carbon and
carbon-carbon coatings of up to the thickness of 310 mu m were made on
molybdenum or tungsten by this deposition gun. X-ray diffraction analysis
indicates that the degree of disorder in the crystal structure of the coating
films deposited in argon is larger than that deposited in hydrogen. Many
diffraction peaks associated with Mo/sub 2/C, WC and W/sub 2/C were observed in
the X-ray diffraction. These peaks show that the interdiffusion between the
deposited film and the substrate increased the adhesive strength of the
deposited film to the substrate.<p>

Abstract: Tungsten-carbon coatings have been deposited on stainless steel
substrates by reactive magnetron sputtering in Ar-CH/sub 4/ mixtures. The
composition of coatings was determined by electron microprobe analyses. Only
the cubic alpha -W phase with an expanded lattice parameter was detected by
X-ray diffraction in the W-C coatings containing less than 25 at.% of carbon.
Since the lattice dilatation of the alpha -W phase increased with increasing
carbon content these coatings were assumed to be tungsten-carbon solid
solutions. The dilatation of the W crystal lattice and Vickers hardness of the
solid-solution-type W-C coatings were measured as functions of the carbon
concentration. A lattice dilatation-microhardness relationship was
established.<p>

Abstract: Eruptions that occur on tungsten electrodes after repeated 35-A arcs
of 1.44-msec duration have been studied with a scanning Auger microprobe and
found to contain high concentrations (20-30 at.%) of carbon. This is much
greater than the average carbon concentration in the tungsten and is in the
vicinity of the W-W/sub 2/C eutectic at 25 at.%. Further evidence that the
eruptions are rich in W/sub 2/C comes from their solubility in hot HNO/sub 3/.
Therefore it appears that carbon progressively segregates in the arc spots due
to its low solid solubility in tungsten and the resultant lowering of the
melting point is responsible for the eruptions.<p>

Abstract: The refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dissolve C, N, and O by
forming interstitial solid solutions. The concentration of these components can
be increased or decreased by annealing treatments, depending on the partial
pressure of gases such as N/sub 2/, O/sub 2/, H/sub 2/O, CH/sub 4/, or CO and
on the temperature of the specimen. New results in binary and ternary systems
combined with those obtained in the last few years provide most of the data
needed for the thermochemical analysis of the solid solution phases and for the
establishment of p-T-c phase diagrams. The mechanisms of the gas-metal
reactions and the general feature of the constitution diagrams are similar for
all refractory metals. However, marked differences exist between group Va
metals niobium and tantalum and group VIa metals molybdenum and tungsten in the
absolute values and temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure of
gaseous species and therefore also in the amount of gas absorbed. The data now
available for the estimation of the final content of interstitials in solid
solution after annealing treatments are compiled and discussed.<p>

Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: Coadsorption experiments on polycrystalline tungsten showed that the
initial sticking probability and the total uptake of oxygen are unaffected by
the prior adsorption of 6.5*10/sup 14/ atoms cm/sup -2/ of nitrogen. Desorption
spectra revealed that nitrogen is not displaced in the process and that the
adsorption energy for nitrogen is relatively unaffected by the presence of
coadsorbed oxygen. AES peak-to-peak height intensities were absolutely
calibrated as a function of nitrogen coverage on W (100), and compared with
previous calibrations for C and O. It was found that during oxygen adsorption
on a nitrogen-saturated surface both the W and the N Auger signals were
attenuated. Flash desorption again shows that nitrogen is not displaced from W
(100), and it is concluded from the degree of attenuation of the N Auger signal
that the N adatoms are buried approximately 3.6 AA beneath a pseudomorphic
layer of tungsten oxide. AA structural model is proposed which is consistent
with the results. The growth of a carbon layer from electron beam interaction
with adsorbed CO was also examined on a N-presaturated W (100) surface, and a
similar model proposed to explain the results.<p>

Abstract: The carburized surface of W(001) has been of interest because of the
moderating effect of the carbon on the catalytic properties of the W surface.
The authors have studied the carburized surface of W(001) formed by
dissociative adsorption of ethylene using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES),
low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and alkali ion scattering. The
previously published sequence of LEED patterns and associated coverages were
reproduced. The intensity of the Li/sup +//C single scattering intensity was
monitored as a function of exposure for various ion incident angles and
correlated to the C/W Auger intensity ratio. Analysis of this data showed that
C adsorbed above the first W layer at all coverages, including that associated
with a (5*1) LEED pattern generated by adsorption at 1500 K. The structure has
been obtained by analysis of the incident angle dependence of the Li/sup +/ on
W single scattering intensity for the clean and carbon covered surfaces. No
major reconstruction of the carburized surface occurs, even for the (5*1). The
prominent C single scattering peak, the incident angle dependence and K/sup +/
multiple scattering features indicate that the C resides at or near the
four-fold hollows at all coverages. Analysis of the incident angle associated
with shadowing of W by C demonstrates that the C atoms are 0.5 AA above the
plane of the first layer W. The LEED (5*1) pattern is attributed to ordering in
the C overlayer and a possible small amplitude periodic strain induced in the
first layer W by the C.<p>

<p>
Abstract: The diffusion coefficients of the radioactive tracer, carbon-14, in
randomly-oriented single crystals of tungsten and tungsten-rhenium alloys (3.9
at.% Re, 6.8 at.%Re) have been measured over the temperature range 1500 degrees
-1800 degrees C. Experimentally, a thin carbide layer, formed on one face of
the sample by a reaction with carbon-14 (fine powder, 10 mc/mM), provided the
source of carbon throughout the diffusion anneal. Since a non-equilibrium
redistribution of carbon occurred during cooling, the concentration profile
within 60 mu m of the interface, measured at room temperature, was different
from that established during the diffusion anneal. Therefore, a computer
iteration technique was used to calculate a best-fit value for D, the diffusion
coefficient, from the measured values of the activity, A(x); the distance from
the carbide-solid solution interface, x; the annealing time, t, and from the
estimated values of the activity at the interface, A/sub L/. In all diffusion
samples, a zone of carbon depletion adjacent to the interface was observed as a
result of carbon segregation to the interface. The extent of the depleted zone
is a function of cooling rate.<p>

Abstract: The surface diffusion of carbon over tungsten was investigated by

carried out for different initial doses of carbon in the range of temperatures
800-970K. The diffusion boundary is anisotropic in character and takes place
according to the parabolic law. The activation energy of the surface diffusion
was measured for three segments in two crystallographic directions: (011) to
(001) and (211) to (001). For a given direction the value of the activation
energy depends on the character of the substrate surface. Also it was observed
that the activation energy decreases with the increase of the initial dose of
carbon. Diffusion constants D/sub 0/ were estimated.<p>

Abstract: For a great number of ion-target combinations similarities in low
energy sputtering have been found. Near the threshold energy for sputtering
E/sub th/ the energy dependence of the sputtering yield can be written as
S=Y(E/E/sub th/)/sup 1/4/(1-E/sub th//E)/sup 7/2/. E/sub th/ and Y depend only
on the surface binding energy E/sub B/ and the ion-target atom mass ratio.
Using this relation the energy dependence of the sputtering yield of B/sub 4/C,
SiC, TiC, TaC, WC is compared with the yields from C, Si, Ti, Ta, W, for H, D
and He in the energy range of 50 eV to 8 keV. A strong similarity of the energy
dependence, i.e. E/sub th/ and Y, can be found between the carbide and the
heavier component of the compound. This leads to the assumption that the target
surface is depleted of the light component due to preferential sputtering and
the sputtering process is dominated by the heavy component.<p>

Abstract: The influence of near-surface impurities on the enhanced sputtering
of graphite near 600 degrees C and above 1000 degrees C has been investigated
under various doping conditions. The chemical sputtering yield of methane
molecules for 2 keV D/sup +/ ions on graphite at 600 degrees C has been
determined for several coverages of Si, Fe, Ni, Ti, Mo, and Au. Graphite
samples were pre-deposited with approximately 500 AA of a given impurity, and
weight loss was monitored in-situ using a vacuum balance while sputtering
through the deposited layer. Small accounts of impurities remaining on the
surface after prolonged sputtering reduced chemical erosion by 30-50%. The
radiation-enhanced sublimation of graphite observed for energetic ion
bombardment above 1000 degrees C was investigated during 50 keV Ar sputtering
and simultaneous Ti evaporation. For very low surface concentrations of Ti,
graphite sputtering increased while for concentrations above 10 at.% the yields
were significantly reduced. A graphite sample containing 4 at.% bulk Si was
also investigated and showed greatly reduced chemical erosion at 600 degrees C
but no reduction in radiation-enhanced sublimation at 1500 degrees C due to
surface enrichment and depletion of Si for the low- and high-temperature
irradiation, respectively.<p>

Abstract: The sputter-erosion of molybdenum and tungsten due to the bombardment
with 7 keV Ar/sup +/, Ne/sup +/ and CO/sup +/ ions and that with 7 keV Ar/sup
+/ ions under oxygen exposure has been measured between room temperature and
1500 degrees C by weight-loss measurements. The reduction of the erosion yield
as well as its enhancement could be found for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment of
molybdenum under oxygen exposure, which is strongly dependent on both
temperature and oxygen pressure. It was also found in molybdenum that for
CO/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yield is reduced at 25 degrees C compared
with that for Ne/sup +/, although their theoretical values are nearly the same,
and increases up to a factor of three in a complicated manner as the
temperature rises, whereas for Ar/sup +/ ion bombardment the erosion yield
shows only a small increase with increasing temperature. On the other hand a
smaller temperature dependence and a reduced sputtering yield at 25 degrees C
was observed for CO/sup +/ bombardment of tungsten. The results are discussed
in relation to various oxidation processes of molybdenum and tungsten.<p>

Abstract: The hydrogen plasma erosion and abrasive wear resistance of glassy
carbon implanted with tungsten has been studied as a function of ion dose. It
was found that the onset of hydrogen plasma erosion inhibition occurred at a
dose of approximately 6.5*10/sup 15/ ion/cm/sup 2/. In addition, the tungsten
implanted material exhibits an increase in wear resistance similar in magnitude
to that obtained with nitrogen and other nonmetallic ions. Carbon ion
implantation does not significantly inhibit erosion in a hydrogen plasma.
Hence, the resistance to such erosion observed with tungsten implanted glassy
carbon is believed to be due to a chemical effect specific to certain metallic
ions. In contrast, increased wear resistance is a defect driven effect not
specific to the ion used.<p>

Abstract: The effect of hydrogen plasma erosion of glassy carbon implanted with
tungsten has been studied for a dose of 2.5*10/sup 16/ ions/cm/sup 2/ and an
average ion energy of 60 keV. Raman measurements of the tungsten-implanted
layer prior to and after exposure to the hydrogen plasma revealed that the
damaged layer induced by tungsten ion bombardment, unlike by C/sup +/
bombardment, has not been completely removed in the plasma erosion process.
Auger profile measurements were performed on the as-implanted layer and after
exposure to a hydrogen plasma for 1 h. By comparing the tungsten depth
distribution for these two cases the hydrogen plasma erosion rate of
tungsten-implanted glassy carbon has been estimated. It has been found that
during the first hour of exposure to the hydrogen plasma the average erosion
rate of the implanted layer was estimated to be 265+or-35 AA/h. In contrast the
erosion rate of unimplanted glassy carbon in the hydrogen plasma was found to
be 3000+or-300 AA/h.<p>

Abstract: The work described concerned the effect of carbon on the mechanical

tests were carried out on cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 5 mm and a
working part length of 25 mm using a PRV-203 machine with indirect heating in a
vacuum of 1.10/sup -4/ mm Hg. The strain rate was 1.6*10/sup -3/ sec/sup -1/.
The specimens were in a recrystallized state after annealing at 1800 degrees C

range 32-28 mu , depending on carbon content, while for nonalloyed tungsten it
was 45 mu .<p>

structure of the crystalline films changes with temperature from beta -WC/sub

is characterized by the formation of carbon-deficient phases, such as W/sub 2/C
or M/sub 6/C.

Abstract: Thermal desorption processes of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from clean
graphite surfaces and metal-deposited graphite surfaces have been investigated.
Thin metal layers of Ti, Cr and Fe on isotropic graphites were prepared by an
electron-beam evaporation method. For these specimens, the irradiation and the
desorption experiments were performed with the use of an ECR ion irradiation
apparatus. The desorption spectra of H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ from the clean
surface had only a single peak at 700 and 800 degrees C. These peaks were found
to originate from the diffusion limited process and to be attributed to the
intrinsic nature of graphite. The metal depositions on the graphite surface
caused a new desorption peak for H/sub 2/ and CH/sub 4/ besides the intrinsic
peak. The temperature and intensity of the new peak depended on the metal
species. The presence of the metals increased the amount of adsorbed H/sub 2/
for fluences of more than 1*10/sup 18/ H/cm/sup 2/ but decreased the amount of
desorbed CH/sub 4/ in the whole fluence range of this study.<p>

Abstract: The authors have studied the condition for self-sustaining coating,
under which coverage with a segregated carbon layer protects a nickel layer
deposited on graphite from ion-induced sputtering. Both the concentration and
the sputtered flux of carbon atoms segregated onto the bombarded surface of the
nickel layer from the graphite underlayer are calculated as a function of ion
flux, utilizing a theoretical model which has been developed for analysis of
the preferential sputtering of alloys. The condition for self-sustaining
coating depends on the diffusion constant and the rate constant of segregation
to the bombarded surface. The calculated results are compared with the
experimental results of the ion-flux dependence of the sputtered fluxes of
nickel and carbon atoms and the rate of segregation for the nickel-carbon
system is 57 s/sup -1/ at 650 degrees C and 1.2 s/sup -1/ at 600 degrees C.
Using the obtained value, the critical thickness of the nickel layer for a
self-sustaining coating is evaluated of the order of 10/sup -2/ cm.<p>

Abstract: A WC layer deposited on graphite has been bombarded with a 5 keV
Ar/sup +/ ion beam at different fluxes at 1550 degrees C, as well as at
6*10/sup 13/ Ar/sup +/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ at different temperatures. The
thickness and the atomic composition of the carbide layer have been measured by
means of the RBS technique at each stage of the Ar/sup +/ bombardments. It is
found that the sputtering yield of W at 1550 degrees C decreases down to zero
at a critical value of 4.6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/ with decreasing ion
flux, and that the sputtering yield of W at 6*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/
also decreases down to zero at a critical temperature of 1600 degrees C with
increasing temperature. It is determined from the analysis of the latter data
that the activation energy of the dissolution rate of carbon atoms at the
surface is 2.0 eV, which is a key parameter for predicting the critical flux
and temperature under different conditions.

Abstract: SiC-coated graphite limiter material was eroded by a plasma during
the plasma edge experiments in Alcator C, and redeposited on the molybdenum
surface of the Janus probe. Surface morphology, composition and structure of
the deposit was examined after a total exposure time of approximately 1000 s.
The redeposited material typically showed a 'layered' morphology. AES depth
profiles revealed increased oxygen content in the redeposited material and an
apparent diffusion of Si and C at the deposit-molybdenum interface. Two clearly
distinguishable chemical states of silicon in the deposit, as observed by XPS,
suggest that plasma ionized polycrystalline SiC is being redeposited as a
mixture of SiC and SiO/sub x/. Preliminary examination of the near surface
regions by SIMS indicated (a) the presence of deuterium in the deposit, (b) the
presence of molybdenum in the first few layers of the deposit, (c) formation by
the plasma of multiple states of Si/sub x/O/sub x/, Si/sub x/C/sub x/, and
Si/sub x/C/sub x/O/sub x/ which do not appear in the spectrum of the unexposed
SiC.<p>

Abstract: In this paper we present data concerning impurity sources and
transport in a tokamak with a divertor and molybdenum first wall. A
spectrometer, viewing visible and UV light, has been used to take time
dependent spectra of C, O, and Mo from both the divertor and the inner limiter
surfaces. In the divertor the sputtering threshold for Mo is not normally
reached (T/sub e/&lt;or=25 eV). Chord measurements from four filtered
photo-diode arrays have enabled us to invert the measured brightness profiles
tomographically and obtain 2D emissivity information for H/sub alpha / and
CIII. The total C flux sputtered at the divertor target can be twice as high as
from the inner wall surface, increasing with density to about 2*10/sup 18/
s/sup -1/. However, modeling the SOL, we find that the penetration efficiency
for C is roughly 10 times smaller for the divertor than for the inner wall.
Oxygen fluxes are generally observed to be 1/3 of the C flux.<p>

Abstract: Alcator C-Mod is a high-field tokamak with which experiments were
initiated in April 1993. The divertor and the first-wall have plasma-facing
surfaces of molybdenum. The divertor has a configuration which is closed in
comparison to other, currently operating tokamaks. The combination of divertor
geometry and high field (density) make Alcator C-Mod an ideal experiment to
investigate dissipative (radiative/CX) divertor scenarios. Single-null divertor
operation has become the standard mode of operation. Relatively clean plasmas
(Z/sub eff/&lt;or=1.3) are obtained with short periods of baking and electron
cyclotron discharge cleaning only. Impurity source rates and screening have
been investigated with an extensive set of wavelength-filtered diode arrays and
spectrographs. Carbon and oxygen and molybdenum dominate the impurity levels.
The molybdenum source from the divertor proper is negligible.

Abstract: This letter reports on two experiments undertaken to evaluate the
retention of gaseous and target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. The
retention for gaseous impurities was determined by puffing Ar into the main
chamber and simulating the time behaviour of the Ar XVI line intensity with a
time dependent impurity transport code including a simple divertor model.
During ohmic heating a factor of 3 and 4.5 enhancement of impurity retention if
found relative to the vacuum time constant (90 ms) of divertor chamber, for
n/sub e/=2*10/sup 13/ and n/sub e/=3.5*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/, respectively,
while a drastic breakdown of the retention occurs during high power NI heating.
To deduce the retention of impurities generated at the divertor plates, a
segment (3.5%) of the plates was covered with copper, a metal previously not
used in ASDEX. By measuring the CU influx at the target plates and the line
intensity of the Cu XX line (11.38 AA) in the core plasma and by using the
transport code, it is found that during NI heating (n/sub e/&lt;or=2*10/sup 13/
cm/sup -3/) Cu atoms originating from the target plates have a &lt;or=3.5 times
higher probability to penetrate into the core plasma than if they had when
originating from the main chamber walls.<p>

Abstract: Metal impurity (Fe, Cu) fluxes to the divertor plates of ASDEX were
measured using a collector probe during discharges with various plasma
parameters. The Cu deposition shows generally a different distribution across
the scrape-off layer compared to the Fe deposition. The maximum Cu deposition
is close to the Cu divertor plates indicating evaporation or sputtering from
these plates. In the center of the SOL, Fe fluxes are indicative of the Fe
content in the central plasma. Variations of the Cu and Fe fluxes with
auxiliary heating and vessel carbonisation are analysed and discussed in
respect of impurity production mechanisms.<p>

Abstract: Carbon tiles and probes, which had been mounted on the vessel walls
of the divertor tokamak ASDEX during different experimental periods as well as
the Ti divertor plates removed in 1986 have been analysed with respect to
deposition of D and metal atoms. The lowest Fe, Ni, Cr deposition (5*10/sup 15/
cm/sup -2/) was found at the area where the separatrix intersects the divertor
plates, while the deposition is much larger (of the order of 10/sup 17/ cm/sup
-2/) at the divertor entrance and the walls of the divertor chamber, as well as
at the walls of the main discharge chamber. This indicates that metal atoms
deposited at the divertor plates are re-eroded, while the final sink for plasma
impurities are the walls of the divertor chamber and of the main plasma vessel.
During the last operation period the plates were made from Cu and the Cu
deposition on the vessel walls was found to increase with the number of
discharges indicating material transport from the divertor chamber into the
main plasma vessel. From the survey of metal atom deposition a material
transport balance is established comparing impurity sources and sinks.<p>

Abstract: The authors describe experiments undertaken to evaluate the retention
of target produced impurities in the ASDEX divertor. The titanium divertor
plates have recently been replaced by water-cooled copper plates. Since copper
is a material not previously present inside the ASDEX torus, a unique
possibility existed to study the transport of the target plate material from
the divertor chamber into the main plasma. By spectroscopic measurement of the
Cu flux emerging from the target plate and of the Cu density in the main
plasma, the retention is assessed. They find a poor retention (R=1) for low
n/sub e/ (n/sub e/&lt;3.0*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/) but a substantially improved
one (R&gt;30) at high densities. During additional heating (NI, ICRH) at the
same density as in the OH case, the retention is lower, but approaches similar
values at slightly higher densities. The retention seems to be independent of
the heating power.<p>

Abstract: The complete heavy impurity cycle of the divertor tokamak ASDEX is
presented. The impurity sources, i.e. sputtering at the vessel wall and at the
divertor plates, have been investigated spectroscopically or with special
erosion probes. The measured erosion fluxes agree with data from sputtering
calculations using measured incident charge exchange (CX) neutral and ion
fluxes. The impurity transport in the plasma boundary has been simulated with a
time dependent one-dimensional computer code. Central impurity confinements has
been investigated with a laser blow-off technique. Investigations on impurity
transport from the divertor plates back to the main plasma have shown a
surprisingly low retention capability of the divertor for plate produced
impurities at low densities, but no adequate code calculation is available.
Finally, the deposition of heavy impurities has been investigated with time
resolving probes and long term wall probes as well as through a post mortem
analysis of the limiters and divertor plates.<p>

Abstract: An experimental investigation of metallic impurities has been made in
the ASDEX divertor in order to better understand their likely sources and
production mechanisms. The impurities were collected on rotatable carbon
collector strips which were exposed to the scrape-off layer plasma near the
upper outer divertor plate under various discharge conditions. Quantitative ion
beam analysis of exposed samples were subsequently carried out by Rutherford
backscattering spectroscopy, proton induced X-ray emission and nuclear reaction
spectroscopy. Time resolved measurements and spatial profiles of collected
impurity fluxes reveal an increase in collected metallic impurities during
auxiliary neutral beam heating of plasma discharges causing strong erosion of
the copper divertor plate. To a rough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliary
heating power is invested in the production of stainless steel impurities.
Measurements made for single-null divertor discharges show a copper flux of
6*10/sup17/ atoms.s/sup -1/ in the scrape-off layer which is not directly
sputtered from the target plates. Collected impurity fluxes in the divertor
chamber are found to increase with both the main plasma current and the
density. Measurements made after boronization reveal an initial reduction in
collected stainless steel impurities although boronization does not have any
long term effect on the suppression of such impurities. Some limitations of the
collector probe technique are also pointed out, and planned improvements of the
existing setup are outlined.<p>

Abstract: A high-purity graphite probe for collecting impurities in ASDEX has
been used for the first time. The probe head consists of a rotatable graphite
cylinder housed in a fixed molybdenum shield containing an exposure slit.
Measurements were made on the scrape-off layer plasma streaming to the upper
outer divertor plate and, after extraction of the probe, collected impurities
were identified and quantified using surface physics techniques. Single null
ohmic discharges produce a threefold increase in erosion of the Cu plate of the
active upper divertor compared to similar double null discharges. The radial
distributions of scrape-off layer impurities change in both shape and intensity
with vertical plasma position. Boronization of the main vessel reduces the
amount of Fe collected by more than a factor of two but the oxygen deposit
increases. Radial distributions of Cu and Fe deposits as a function of time for
a neutral beam heated discharge are also discussed.<p>

Abstract: Impurity production and transport in ASDEX have been studied using a
rotatable graphite collector probe which was exposed to the scrape-off layer
plasma in the upper divertor chamber. Metallic deposits on the probe were later
analysed using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction
analysis. Time resolved information (during tokamak discharges) and spatial
profiles of collected impurity fluxes indicate strong erosion of the copper
divertor plate during neutral beam heating of the plasma. Both stainless steel
and copper deposits increase with neutral beam power. It is shown that, to a
rough approximation, 0.2% of this auxiliary heating contributes to the increase
in collected stainless steel impurities. Measurements made for single-null
divertor discharges show that a copper flux of 6*10/sup 17/ atoms s/sup -1/ is
present in the scrape-off layer which is not directly sputtered from the target
plates. Measurements made subsequent to boronization reveal an initial
reduction in collected heavy impurities although boronization does not appear
to have any significant long-term effect on the suppression of such
impurities.<p>

Abstract: The origin of carbon and oxygen impurities observed in the bulk
plasma of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak is investigated by means of particle influx
measurements using spectroscopy in the visible spectral range and impurity
density measurements using spectroscopy in the soft X ray range. A number of
ohmically heated discharges are evaluated and statistically analysed to reduce
the influence of the individual experimental scatter. The interpretation of the
spectroscopic measurements is supported by mass spectrometry, which allows the
partial fluxes of the various molecular species to be resolved. The measured
fluxes and concentrations reveal a consistent picture: for low electron
densities and impure wall conditions, CO recycling in the main plasma chamber
is the dominant source of carbon and oxygen, leading to similar concentrations
of these species in the bulk plasma. At higher densities or with freshly
boronized walls, the oxygen concentration is significantly reduced to 0.05% of
the electron density. The corresponding reduction of carbon saturates at a
level of about 0.3%. This behaviour is attributed to chemical erosion due to
hydrocarbon formation and desorption with a yield of a few per cent of the
hydrogen flux. The resulting carbon ion flux is reduced owing to wall
redeposition, but still amounts to about 0.45% of the hydrogen flux. This level
imposes severe limitations on the use of graphite in a low temperature, high
recycling divertor of a future reactor.<p>

Abstract: The erosion, plasma penetration and redeposition of divertor plate
material such as C, Si, V, Mo and W have been studied in the ASDEX-Upgrade
divertor. Long-term erosion and redeposition have been studied using evaporated
markers, while time resolved measurements and plasma penetration were studied
spectroscopically on W tiles. The expected reduction of erosion due to plasma
ion sputtering could be confirmed. This reduced erosion is accompanied by
largely enhanced deposition for high-Z ions, when the gyroradius exceeds the
ionisation length.<p>

Abstract: Passive spectroscopy has been used for in situ studies of the erosion
of various divertor target materials in ASDEX-Upgrade. Yields measured for the
erosion of graphite over a range of moderate densities can be explained by
physical sputtering alone, although there may also be small contributions from
chemical processes. At high density, detachment of the divertor plasma occurs
and sputtering of the target ceases. Under such high-density conditions high-Z
materials, e.g. tungsten, offer a promising alternative to graphite. First
studies of the erosion of these materials confirm the expected low sputtering
rates and the short ionisation lengths of sputtered neutrals. The latter
implies efficient prompt redeposition which should suppress production of
higher ionisation stages and associated problems with self-sputtering.

Abstract: Since the introduction of new graphite tiles on the divertor regions
and the center post of DIII-D, beta backscatter measurements have been made of
the metals codeposited on these surfaces at three different times. At the first
vent (June 1988), the upper and lower portions of the machine appeared very
similar, with the average amount of metal on a surface increasing with
increasing radius and indications that local tile alignment had an effect on
the amount of metal deposited. Measurements made during subsequent vents show
that there has been much more metal deposited on the lower divertor than on the
upper. Metal seems to be concentrated at radii both less than and greater than
that expected for the strike zones. From measurements made during the latest
vent (December 1989) there is clear indication that material has been eroded
from a position of the outer strike zone, probably to be redeposited at a
larger radius.<p>

Abstract: Hydrogen recycling and impurity influx are important issues in
obtaining high confinement discharges in the DIII-D tokamak. To reduce metallic
impurities in DIII-D, 40% of the wall area, including the highest heat flux
zones, have been covered with graphite tiles. However, erosion, redeposition,
and hydrogen retention in the tiles, as well as metal transport from the
remaining Inconel walls, can lead to enhanced recycling and impurity influx.
Hydrogen and metal retention in divertor floor tiles have been measured using
external ion beam analysis techniques following four campaigns where tiles were
exposed to several thousand tokamak discharges. The areal density of deuterium
retained following exposure to tokamak plasmas was measured with external
nuclear reaction analysis. External proton-induced X-ray emission analysis was
used to measure the areal densities of metallic impurities deposited upon the
divertor tiles either by sputtering of metallic components during discharges or
as contamination during tile fabrication. Measurements for both deuterium and
metallic impurities were taken on both the tile surfaces which face the
operating plasma and the surfaces on the sides of the tiles which form the
small gaps separating each of the tiles in the divertor. The highest areal
densities of both deuterium (from 2 to 8*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) and metals
(from 0.2 to 1*10/sup 18/ atoms/cm/sup 2/) were found on the plasma-facing
surface near the inner strike point region of each set of divertor tiles.
Significant deposits, extending as far as 1 cm from the plasma-facing surface
and containing up to 40% of the total divertor deposition, were also observed
on the gap-forming surfaces of the tiles.<p>

For a tungsten film, no appreciable erosion was detected. However, measurements
of deposited tungsten on adjacent carbon surfaces indicated a net W erosion
rate of 0.06 nm/s.

diffusion to substantial depths through pores into the bulk. It is demonstrated

Abstract: The interaction of the boundary plasma with the limiters has been
analyzed for two 5 MA 20 s Ohmic discharges in JET by Langmuir probes and by an
all carbon collector probe. The deposition of D, C, Ni and Cr and the erosion
on the probe have been measured as functions of the distance to the last closed
magnetic flux surface. The values are compared to the particle fluences and
their energies as calculated from the measured plasma parameters. The
calculated deuterium fluences are about a factor of 5 to 10 larger than the
deposition on the probe and the calculated e-folding length is steeper than the
measured values. The carbon deposition and erosion at the probe has been
determined with the aid of /sup 13/C implants as well as from the depth of the
metal and deuterium depositions and the interference colours of the deposited
films. The distribution of deposited carbon similar to the trapped deuterium
with a ratio D:C of about 0.3, indicating that D trapping is dominated by
saturation of the deposited C layer. The metal deposition is small; it amounts
to a few times 10/sup -3/ of the carbon deposition, indicating the dominance of
carbon in the boundary layer.

Abstract: The isotropic graphite ETP-10 was used as the divertor tiles
(divertor plate) in the lower X-point configuration of JT-60. For these
graphite tiles, numerous surface properties were investigated. The surface
morphology was largely changed into a spongelike, column or smooth structure.
The Raman spectroscopy analysis showed that the structure was composed of
broadened crystal and defective structures, in addition to the amorphous
structure, in every surface region. As the major impurities, O, Ti, Ni, Cr and
Fe were detected by both AES analysis and PIXE analysis. The total outgassing
amount, measured by the technique of TDS, was one or two orders of magnitude
larger than that of the as-received sample. At the surface within a depth of 50
nm, the hydrogen concentration ranged from 10 to 20 at.%. A considerable amount
of hydrogen was observed in the deeper region up to several millimeters.<p>

Abstract: Damage to a TiC coated Mo divertor plate used in JT-60 for about two
years was re-examined from a material viewpoint to obtain data concerning
utilization of high-Z plasma facing components in future fusion reactors.
Serious damage was observed on the edge of several divertor plates located next
to a toroidal gap. Due to very high heat fluxes a part of the edge was melted
and a large crack of about 12 cm wide and 2.5 cm deep was caused near the
melted edge along a lamination of the Mo plate. Recrystallization by the heat
loading embrittled the subsurface region and resulted in cracking and melting
at a lower heat loading. The present work suggests that the maximum temperature
of the powder metallurgical Mo should be maintained below the recrystallization
temperature to prevent material degradation and plasma radiation losses.

Abstract: A plasmachemical in-situ technique for the deposition of carbon on
limiters and first wall of the tokamak TEXTOR has been developed. RG-discharge
in a throughflow of hydrogen with admixed 1.5% methane has been used to implant
methane ions into the limiters and wall. Different samples (Inconel 600) in
liner position have been exposed and afterwards analyzed with SIMS and AES. It
has been shown that during the plasmachemical carbon deposition at 240 degrees
C predominantly chromium carbide was formed in the surface near layer. Nickel
carbide was traced in a negligibly small amount. Depth profiles indicate an
exponential dependence of the chromium carbide concentration up to a depth of
about 10 nm. This is in agreement with the estimated diffusion profile of
carbon; literature values of the carbon diffusivity in Ni, Ni-Cr and Ni-Co
alloys yield a mean characteristic diffusion length of about 8 nm. The total
amount of deposited carbon as determined from AES measurements is 6*10/sup 15/
atoms cm/sup -2/, in reasonable agreement with 1.2*10/sup 16/ cm/sup -2/ as
determined from the partial pressure balance during the carbidization
process.<p>

Abstract: Samples of Si, Ni and Cr exposed to an in situ 'carbonization' in the
Tokamak TEXTOR have been investigated. Depth profiles have been measured by
argon ion sputter etching and AES. From the AES energy spectra (direct
counting), the relative AES signals (peak to background ratios) have been
derived by properly fitting the background and the peaks. The depth profiles
are discussed in light of a ballistic-mixing model for sputter etching and a
standard exponential Auger escape probability.<p>

Abstract: A POCO graphite sample was exposed to an electron cyclotron resonance
(ECR) plasma for 5 h. Surfaces of the sample were analyzed by AES. No metal
deposition was found. Another graphite sample was exposed to an RF-assisted
glow (RG) discharge for 6 h. Iron and nickel were found with AES, at surface
concentrations of 3% and 1%, respectively. The space potential measured by a
Langmuir probe was less than 20 V for ECR plasma and 265 V for RG discharge. In
the case of the ECR discharge, the impact energy of ions on the wall is lower
than the threshold energy of metal sputtering. Actually, no metal contamination
of the carbon sample occurred.<p>

Abstract: Carbonaceous films as produced for in-situ wall conditioning purposes
in the TEXTOR tokamak have been investigated with SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass
Spectroscopy) and AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy). The measurements were
supplemented by optical analyses and mechanical thickness measurements. The
exposure to the in-situ carbonization process has been performed by placing the
samples (Si, graphite, glassy carbon, Ni, Cr and Inconel) in linear positions.
Independent of the substrate material the obtained films were homogeneous in
thickness and composition. Depth profiles revealed impurity-free films with
constant C/H ratio and slightly contaminated interfaces. The contaminants, i.e.
metals (Fe, Ni, Cr) and O as detected on appropriate substrates, are supposed
to be deposited due to sputtering of wall material during the initial period of
the carbonization process. The hydrogen in the carbon film is strongly bound.
Exchange processes of the incorporated hydrogen during plasma discharges have
been investigated. Blistering of the carbon films during noble gas ion
bombardment have been observed.<p>

Abstract: Surface analysis has been carried out on samples exposed to
carbonization, discharge cleaning and tokamak discharges with Auger Electron
Spectroscopy (AES). A carbon layer of approximately 30 monolayers on an Inconel
sample was neither fully removed nor contaminated during exposure to 134
tokamak discharges at the liner position. The carbon layer was also not removed
with exposure to 25 discharges at 1 cm behind the main limiters. Deposition of
metals and oxygen was observed on the top surface of the C-layer in this case.
Deposition of carbon on silicon samples was found with a carbonized wall after
exposure to tokamak discharges. From a semi-quantitative discussion of these
experimental results, it has been concluded that the C-layer on the liner, on
Faraday shields and on limiters have long life time, and redeposition processes
contribute to maintaining the carbon layer. Removal of the carbon layer by
glow-discharge cleaning has also been demonstrated.<p>

Abstract: The carbonization of the metallic liner and limiters of TEXTOR led to
plasmas which contained less than 10/sup -5/ metal, and, in best cases,
(0.6+or-0.4)% low Z ions per D/sup +/. However disruptions damaged some of the
carbon film and evaporated metal atoms. These were redeposited on the carbon
layer and became a source of impurities. Graphite limiters have been used since
mid-1985. The metal pollution is not a problem for more than 1000 discharges
after one carbonization. However the low Z contamination was initially five
times larger than earlier. Surprisingly, the oxygen concentration had
considerably increased. Experiments were performed to identify the sources of C
and O and to improve the conditioning methods in this 'all carbon' surrounding.
The main tools used were: RG (radiofrequency assisted DC glow) discharges in
H/sub 2/, D/sub 2/, and their mixtures with CH/sub 4/ and CD/sub 4/, the study
of the H/D ratio in water and hydrocarbons and of the CO and CO/sub 2/ released
during the ramp heating and cooling of limiters, liner, vessel and main
portholes, and the modulation of the deuterium fluxes to the liner and limiters
during tokamak discharges. The quality of tokamak plasmas measures the progress
of the wall conditioning. The authors describe the optimized conditioning
procedure which was applied after the most probable oxygen source had been
drastically reduced.<p>

Abstract: Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysis
techniques were used to determine the concentration of oxygen, metals and
deuterium in the surface region of collector probes exposed to the plasma
discharges in the carbonized TEXTOR fusion device. The paper focuses on time-
and space-resolved measurements of oxygen collected during 13 tokamak shots on
three cylindrical graphite probes placed near to the plasma boundary. Each
probe was exposed to several discharges. Generally, the areal concentration of
oxygen was found to be 15-25 times higher than that of metals and about 5-8
times lower than that of trapped deuterium. The influence of ICR heating,
plasma density and other plasma parameters upon the deposition rate of oxygen
and other species are discussed. The possible chemical state of the deposited
oxygen is considered.<p>

Abstract: Impurity fluxes of metals have been determined in the scrape-off
layer of TEXTOR. Time-resolved measurements have been performed using graphite
collector probes. Results were found when ALT II acted as the only limiter and
were compared to earlier operational phases. Typical fluxes were (1-8)*10/sup
18/ atoms m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/. The metal density was determined to be in the
range 10/sup 15/ atoms m/sup -3/, and the cross-field diffusion coefficient 6
m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/. A distinct reduction of deposited metals as well as
deuterium and oxygen was found in comparison to earlier measurements performed
in the presence of the poloidal and ALT I limiters. Increased fluxes were
observed during auxiliary ICR heating.<p>

Abstract: Long-term samples literally cut out of the TEXTOR liner after 31
months of tokamak operation and with 81 a-C:H coatings and corresponding
wall-cleaning cycles have been analyzed for carbon and carbide contents. The
analysis consisted in AES depth-profiling, AES line-scanning, and
electro-chemical etching of sample cross-sections. A 10 to 35 mu m thick
under-stoichiometric carbide layer with 10 at.% of carbon at the surface was
found. There is an unpredicted correlation between the thickness of the
individual coatings and the carbide layer, although 50% fluctuations in the
toroidal distribution are observed. Apparently more than 20% of the carbon
supply to the surface during coating is built into the liner surface, despite
the glow discharge cleaning of the remaining a-C:H before each new deposition.
The presence of the carbide layer may in general cause changes in the
mechanical and thermal properties of the first wall in plasma devices which are
routinely carbonized.<p>

Abstract: The material redeposited on the collector probe in the SOL of TEXTOR
after boronization has been identified as a-C/B:D, i.e. as almost identical
with the virgin coating. A conversion factor of 6.3*10/sup 17/ C/cm/sup 2/ for
100 nm thickness was found which corresponds to a density rho =1.26 g/cm/sup
2/. Erosion of C and B from the coated graphite limiters causes stationary
deposition during the discharge and distributions within the SOL. After 200
discharges the ratio B/C=0.23 is lower than the original (B/C approximately
0.5-1). Observations made with the collector probe confirm the reduced C and O
contamination of the plasma due to boronization. Carbon rates have been
determined shotwise after an integrated exposure by AES-depth profiling of the
stratified deposit. A deposition rate of 1*10/sup 16/ C/cm/sup 2/ s typically
was found at a+2 cm and n/sub e/=2.8*10/sup 13/ cm/sup -3/. It increases at
lower densities as do the other impurities.<p>

Abstract: The graphite limiters and the inconel liner of TEXTOR have been
coated in-situ with boron-doped carbonaceous film (boronization). Several
samples of SS 304, Inconel 600, graphite (EK 98) and silicon single crystals
were exposed to the boronization procedure at two different toroidal locations
(liner level). The depth composition of the deposited layers (noted as a-C/B:H)
have been investigated later by AES analysis combined with Ar-sputtering, and
by SNMS. Depth profiles showed the homogeneity of the films. In addition, a
toroidal variation in the B/C-ratio ( approximately=0.5 and approximately=1.0),
in the hydrogen content, as well as in the thickness, was observed. No traces
of bulk oxidation were found. A boronized Inconel target, exposed to 253
tokamak discharges in D/sub 2/, exhibits only a minute erosion of the
originally deposited film. An additional thin layer deposited by plasma
transport on the surface contained mainly carbon, and little boron, oxygen and
metal impurities.<p>

Abstract: Impurities transported in the scrape-off layer (SOL) of a tokamak
TEXTOR were collected on Si samples exposed in SOL, and their amounts were
measured quantitatively, using an in situ surface analysis station equipped
with an Auger electron analyser and an ion gun. Tokamak discharges have been
made in all carbon surroundings, i.e. graphite limiters and the carbonized
liner and also recently in boron-carbon coated (boronized) surroundings. The
analysis shows that mainly carbon is collected accompanied by oxygen (less than
approximately 15%), and by boron (approximately 20%), after boronization. The
authors present data concerning the amount of the redeposited carbon as a
function of the toroidal distance between the sample and limiters, and of the
electron density, in order to discuss the mechanism of its redeposition.<p>

Abstract: Plasma induced erosion and redeposition at the vessel walls has been
measured by surface layer analysis of a carbon probe with evaporated markers
before and after exposure in the boundary plasma of the TEXTOR tokamak. The
results are compared with those calculated with the computer simulation program
ERO. The erosion is dominated by carbon and oxygen impurity fluxes in the
boundary plasma. Carbon is deposited on the marker surfaces and has to be
resputtered for the marker material to be sputtered. Mo atoms sputtered from
the marker are found to be redeposited in the slit of the probe. The
redeposition pattern can be explained by direct deposition of sputtered Mo
neutrals.<p>

Abstract: In TEXTOR a Mo limiter has been tested under various conditions of
ohmic and NBI heating for about 100 discharges. Maximum power fluxes of 20
MW/m/sup 2/ have been loaded onto the Mo limiter without any serious damage
which led to maximal surface temperatures of about 2800 K. The Mo-limiter
surface was molten twice with a very thin layer of melting. Local spectroscopy
shows that Mo is released predominantly by physical sputtering of the low-Z
impurities carbon, oxygen and silicon. The impurity deposition rates in the SOL
were measured using collector probes showing a ratio of Si/C and Mo/C of
typically 6/100 and 0.1-1/100, respectively. Post-mortem analyses have revealed
no impurity deposition on the Mo surface indicating that the limiter was
operated under erosion conditions. The Mo limiter did not influence the plasma
performance very much except for high-density ohmic shots where strong central
radiation appeared resulting in a minor disruption or special mode. No serious
after-effect due to a possible contamination of the first wall by Mo impurities
could be observed.<p>

Abstract: In TEXTOR a high Z limiter experiment was carried out. Mo and W were
used as a limiter (10 cm long, 6 cm wide and 5 cm high) and inserted up to 3 cm
closer to the plasma than to the main limiter, an ALT-II graphite limiter. Both
the thermal response of the limiter and the influence to the plasma performance
were analyzed in detail and compared with those for the fine-grained graphite
(EK98) routinely used. Maximum power fluxes of about 20 MW m/sup -2/ for 2 s
could be loaded on the Mo limiter without severe damage, and the maximum
surface temperature was about 2600 degrees C. Consequently the limiter surface
was subjected to local melting leaving the trace of molten layers. However, the
evaporated Mo during the melting did not influence the main plasma very much,
probably owing to redeposition of Mo within one period of gyromotion after the
ionization. After the experiment the surface of the Mo limiter was examined by
various techniques. Although the limiter head was not seriously damaged,
appreciable recrystallization and grain growth were observed, which enhanced
the propagation of intergranular cracking owing to the thermal stress triggered
by congruent melting with the thermocouple. No deposition of impurities of B,
C, O and Si which were the main impurities in the TEXTOR plasma, was observed
on the limiter head. The very high temperature of the limiter surface seems to
promote the evaporation of once-deposited impurities.

discharges in TFTR to provide data on the limiter conditioning processes. Some
tiles surfaces showed nearly complete removal of the TiC surface as a result of
plasma exposure. 3D and 2D elemental mapping of the tile surface region show
deposition of vacuum vessel metals (primarily Ti and Ni) in the form of
oxides.<p>

Abstract: Central medium and low Z impurity concentrations and Z/sub eff/ have
been measured by X-ray spectrometry in Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor discharges
during three periods of operation. These were (1) startup period, (2) ohmic
heating, and (3) ohmic heating portion of the two neutral beam periods,
distinguished mainly by different vacuum vessel internal hardware and
increasing plasma current and toroidal field capability. Plasma parameters
spanned minor radius a=0.41-0.83 m, major radius R=2.1-3.1 m, current I/sub
p/=0.25-2.0 MA, line averaged electron density n/sub e/=(0.9-4.0)*10/sup 19/
m/sup -3/, and toroidal magnetic field B/sub T/=1.8-4.0 T. The metal impurities
came mostly from the limiter. At low densities titanium or nickel approached 1%
of n/sub e/ during operation on a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter,
respectively. Lower levels of Cr, Fe and Ni (&lt;or approximately=0.1%) were
observed with a graphite limiter at similarly low densities; these elements
were removed mainly from stainless steel or Inconel hardware within the vacuum
vessel during pulse discharge cleaning or plasma operation on an Inconel
limiter and then deposited on the graphite limiter. Hardware closet to the
plasma contributed most to the deposits. Subsequent discharge slowly eroded the
deposits from the limiter and reduced the metal impurity levels in the plasma.
Both total low Z and metal impurity concentrations, relative to n/sub e/,
decreased approximately exponentially with n/sub e/ and increased with I/sub
p/. The metals showed much larger variations than did low Z elements, dropping
to &gt;or approximately=10/sup -5/ n/sub e/ at high density. Low Z impurities,
mainly carbon and oxygen, ranged from 10% of n/sub e/ at low n/sub e/ to 3% at
high n/sub e/ and usually dominated Z/sub eff/ and power loss. In low density
plasmas with a TiC-coated graphite or Inconel limiter, the respective metals
contributed 30-50% of Z/sub eff/ and &lt;or approximately=10-20% of the central
input power. The metal contributions to Z/sub eff/ and radiated power were much
lower with the graphite limiter.<p>

Abstract: The important impurities in ohmically heated TFTR plasmas are carbon
and oxygen. The concentration of O is independent of the mass or charge of the
fuel gas; C is slightly less abundant in D plasmas than in He plasmas. C is
more abundant than O by a factor of 10 at low densities (Sin/sub e/
approximately=2*10Su1/sup 9/ m/sup -3/); at the high density limit (n/sub e/
equivalent to 4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for H, n/sub e/ equivalent to 8*10/sup 19/
m/sup -3/ for He) the O concentration is equal to or slightly greater than that
of C. The impurity concentration as a function of edge electron temperature is
compared with a simple sputtering model which shows the importance of C-C and
O-C sputtering at the limiter in addition to fuel gas sputtering in explaining
the observed carbon concentration.<p>

Agreement between the analytical model and the experimental data is good. The

Abstract: Special limiter conditioning techniques using low density deuterium
or helium discharges have produced enhanced plasma confinement in TFTSR.
Measurements with a rotatable collector probe have been made to increase our
understanding of the boundary layer during these conditioning sequences. A set
of silicon films behind slits facing in the ion and electron drift directions
was exposed to four difference D/sup +/ and He/sup 2+/ discharge sequences. The
amounts of deuterium and impurities trapped in the surface regions of the
samples have been measured by different analytical techniques, including
nuclear reaction analysis for retained deuterium, Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy for carbon and metals, and Auger electron spectroscopy for carbon,
oxygen and metals. Up to 1.9*10/sup 17/ cm/sup -2/ of deuterium was detected in
codeposited carbon layers with D/C generally in the range of the bulk
saturation limit. Radial profiles and ion drift/electron drift asymmetries are
discussed.<p>

Abstract: A plasma-enhanced CVD process was used to deposit thin (40-100 nm),
amorphous carbon/boron films onto the first wall of TFTR. A series of plasma
experiments was performed to test the effect of this first-wall modification on
low-Z impurity (carbon, oxygen) behavior, suppression of metallic impurities,
post-disruption recovery, hydrogenic recycling, and plasma density limits. The
analysis of the plasma performance following the first few boronization
attempts on TFTR shows: (1) suppression by a factor of 1.5-3 of carbon
impurities immediately after boronization, although this suppression is
short-lived ( approximately 10 shots); (2) long term suppression of oxygen and
metallic impurities by a factor of two; (3) significant suppression of oxygen
impurity emission following disruptions and during pulse discharge cleaning;
and (4) no significant change in hydrogenic recycling properties in comparison
to the pre-existing carbon first wall.

As beryllium was selected as a reference plasma-facing material for the ITER, a
literature search for the use of beryllium in tokamaks has been performed using
the MELVYL INSPEC database. Beryllium has been used as a plasma-facing material
in three tokamaks such as Unitor, ISX-B, and JET. We examined the database for
papers published between 1/1/69 and 9/25/95 using "the name of the tokamk" and
"beryllium" for a "find title words" command. In the following report, we have
listed the bibliographic information and abstracts for each tokamak.<b>

Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters were inserted into the plasma of the tokamak
Unitor to study the behavior of this material. The power load onto the limiter
surface was about 2 kW.cm/sup -2/. The occurrence of heavy (Cr) and light (O)
impurities was monitored spectroscopically. It was found that the contamination
by heavy impurities stemming from the first wall (Cr) was reduced by a factor
of ten in the course of a few subsequent shots. In comparison with other
limiter materials (graphite, TiC, spinel, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/) the number of
disruptive discharges was considerably reduced. After breaking the vacuum and
opening the vessel, the beryllium deposition on the wall and the various
components (pumps, mass spectrometer, etc.) were studied. No volatile beryllium
dust could be detected by samplers. The released beryllium was found to be
quantitatively condensed on the torus wall with a thickness of ten monolayers
after 1000 tokamak shots.<p>

Abstract: Beryllium rail limiters are inserted into the tokamak UNITOR to study
the compatibility of this material with the plasma. The power load onto the
limiter surface is 1-2 kW/cm/sup 2/ during the plasma pulse length of 50 ms
duration. The concentration of heavy (Cr) and light (O) impurities is monitored
by means of spectroscopy. In comparison with other materials tested likewise
(graphite, Ni, Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, TiC, SiC, SS) the Be-experiments have shown
the following improvements: (a) the concentration of heavy impurities is
considerably reduced, (b) this reduction is preserved if the poloidal
Be-limiters are retracted from the plasma, (c) the plasma resistivity is
diminished, (d) the occurrence of disruptions decreases. A total amount of 6 mg
beryllium was found distributed on the inner torus wall after 1500 shots. The
decontamination of the apparatus was performed without major problems. Only
very little volatile Be-dust was detected, and peripheric parts (pumps, mass
spectrometer etc.) were not contaminated. The beryllium released from the
limiters was found to be entirely deposited on the torus wall mainly in the
vicinity of the limiters.<p>

Abstract: The release and transport of beryllium in a tokamak plasma are
investigated numerically in order to characterize the impurity concentrations
and fluxes. A model has been developed and applied to the small-scale tokamak
UNITOR when operated with beryllium limiters. The source term for the beryllium
influx is evaluated to be approximately 10/sup 18/ s/sup -1/. The spatial
distributions of the various beryllium ions are given which reveal that fully
stripped beryllium is dominant in the plasma core. There the contribution of
beryllium to Z/sub eff/ is at most 1. Further, the solution of rate equations
indicates that the population densities of ground state and metastable neutral
beryllium are of comparable order. These theoretical results will be used to
interpret measurement of the beryllium concentrations and fluxes in front of
the limiter by laser-induced fluorescence, which are now under way.<p>

Abstract: The use of beryllium as a wall and limiter material is investigated
in the small Tokamak UNITOR. The transport of neutral and ionized beryllium
released from poloidal limiter is studied both experimentally and numerically.
The numerical simulation is based on an impurity transport algorithm in
cylindrical geometry. It comprises anomalous diffusion as well as ionization;
recombination via charge exchange processes is included for highly ionized
beryllium atoms. The code yields the spatial distribution of the various
ionization states with densities up to 4% of the electron density n/sub e/ and
fluxes up to 10/sup 19/ m/sup -2/s/sup -1/. The contribution of beryllium to
Z/sub eff/ is evaluated to be well below 1. The spatial and temporal
distribution of neutral beryllium is measured by laser induced fluorescence.
For this purpose, the Be I resonance line at 234.9 nm is pumped by a frequency
doubled dye laser. These measurements yield the densities as well as the fluxes
of neutral beryllium released from the limiter. The experimental results reveal
that besides sputtering additional erosion mechanisms are of importance.<p>

Abstract: Laser-induced fluorescence experiments are performed in UNITOR in
order to study the release and the transport of beryllium which is ablated from
poloidal limiters. The concentrations of neutral and ionized beryllium atoms
are measured. The experimental results are used as input data for
two-dimensional transport calculations. The results show that low-lying
ionization stages of beryllium remain localized in the vicinity of the limiter.
The bulk contamination consists of fully stripped beryllium at a level of about
0.9% n/sub e/ at the centre. This indicates that beryllium contributes at most
0.14 to Z/sub eff/.<p>

Abstract: The release of beryllium from poloidal limiter tiles was investigated
by laser-induced fluorescence. The measured beryllium fluxes are in the range
10/sup 19/-10/sup 20/ m/sup -2/ s/sup -1/, depending on the proton flux and
heat load onto the limiters. Evaluation of the data shows that besides physical
sputtering by protons sublimation becomes important at elevated surface
temperatures. The density of neutral metastables in front of the limiter was
found to be two times higher than the ground-state density.

Abstract: A movable, temperature-controlled beryllium rail limiter has been
used in the Impurity Study Experiment (ISX-B) tokamak at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL). The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the
suitability of the material for installation on the Joint European Torus (JET)
experiment. The limiter was designed for a surface temperature rise of 600
degrees C for each tokamak shot. This rise corresponds to a heat flux to the
limiter surface of approximately 2.1 to 2.4 kW/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 s. The
experimental test was expected to require a lifetime of approximately 3000
neutral beam-heated plasma discharges to meet the planned surface fluence of
10/sup 22/ hydrogen ions per cm/sup 2/. A temperature control system was used
to maintain the base-plate temperature of the limiter at about 200 degrees C.
Normal plasma radius was 24 cm. the experimental results indicate that the
beryllium limiter functions normally unless brought to melting point, when
evaporated beryllium covers the liner walls, gettering the discharge. Under
these conditions beryllium was the dominant impurity.<p>

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B beryllium has been conducted in support
of the beryllium limiter experiment on the ISX-B tokamak at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. The S-65-B grade of hot-pressed beryllium was chosen over S-200-E
because of its superior strength and ductility at elevated temperatures. The
testing has included measurement of tensile and yield strength, ductility,
Young's Modulus, thermal conductivity, and specific heat from 50 degrees C to
700 degrees C. Thermal fatigue testing of a 2.5 cm beryllium cube was conducted
using an electron beam to apply a heat flux of 2.5 kw/cm/sup 2/ for 0.3 second
pulses for 1500 cycles. Results from the tests are compared to elastic-plastic
finite element stress calculations. The testing indicates that the ISX-B
beryllium limiter should survive the tokamak environment without serious
structural failure, although some surface cracking is expected to occur.<p>

Abstract: An experiment to test beryllium as a limiter material has been
performed in the ISX-B tokamak. One facet of the studies centred on
characterizing impurity influxes and concentrations. The radiation from both
low-Z (Be, C, N, O) and intermediate-Z (Ti, Cr) contaminants was measured at
the limiter surface and at a wall location 90 degrees away from the limiter to
assess the relative contributions of metallic impurities from the two different
sources. The effect of limiter melting, with concomitant reduction of both
low-Z and intermediate-Z elements, was also documented. The analysis, including
atomic rate coefficients for interpreting spectral radiation in terms of
production rates is discussed in detail.<p>

Abstract: Materials testing of S-65-B grade beryllium has been conducted in
order to evaluate the use of this material for limiter surfaces in the ISX-B
and JET tokamaks. Selected thermal and mechanical properties were measured at
temperatures up to 700 degrees C. These measurements revealed that S-65-B has
exceptionally high ductility (up to roughly 50% elongation) at temperatures
expected in normal operation of a beryllium limiter. Thermal fatigue tests
under conditions relevant to limiters in ISX-B and JET were also performed
using the Sandia National Laboratories Electron Beam Test System (EBTS).
Results from these tests were compared to calculated results based on
elastic-plastic finite element stress analyses. It was concluded from these
tests and analyses that properly designed beryllium limiters should survive
normal operation in ISX-B, JET, and similar devices without serious structural
failure. Some degree of surface cracking can be expected, however unless cyclic
plastic deformation at the heated surfaces can be adequately controlled by
careful design of the limiter.<p>

Abstract: An experiment has been performed on the Impurity Study Experiment
(ISX-B) tokamak to test beryllium as a limiter material. Beryllium is an
attractive candidate for a limiter and has been proposed for use in the Joint
European Torus (JET) experiment. A temperature-controlled, segmented, beryllium
top-rail limiter was located inside the plasma radius described by the existing
titanium limiters. An extended set of diagnostics was added for measurement of
scrapeoff and limiter parameters. These included visible and infrared
monitoring systems, probes, and surface analysis experiments. Tokamak
experiments included parameter surveys of both Ohmically heated and
neutral-beam-heated plasmas and an extended fluence test of the limiter. The
most significant effect of operation with a beryllium limiter was the reduction
in low-Z impurities caused by gettering action of beryllium deposited on the
liner walls. The experiment required the design and implementation of
contamination control apparatus and work procedures to prevent the accidental
dispersion of beryllium dust.<p>

Abstract: An experiment to test beryllium as a limiter material has been
performed in the ISX-B tokamak. The effect of the plasma on the limiter and the
effect of the limiter on the plasma were studied in detail. Heat and particle
fluxes to the limiter were measured, and limiter damage by melting was
documented as a function of power flux. Strong melting and evaporation of the
limiter caused beryllium gettering of the vacuum vessel. Postmortem analysis of
the limiter was performed to document the amount of retained hydrogen and the
erosion and impurity deposition on the limiter. The effect of the limiter on
the plasma performance was studied in terms of parameter space, impurity
content, and confinement for the ungettered and gettered cases. Operational
experience with beryllium in a fusion experiment is discussed.<p>

Abstract: A beryllium limiter has been installed in the Impurity Study
Experiment-B (ISX-B) tokamak to test the applicability of beryllium as a
plasma-side component for possible use in the Joint European Torus (JET). This
test is a collaborative effort involving both ORNL and JET personnel. The ISX-B
tokamak is operated for more than 3000 high power neutral beam injected
discharges using the beryllium limiter as the main confining aperture. In order
to access the migration of beryllium in the tokamak and attached diagnostics,
both stainless steel and silicon samples are placed at various strategic
positions and used as catcher plates. Nuclear reaction analysis is used to
measure the beryllium deposited on the plates and provided a measure of the
beryllium migration. Both particulates and a thin film are found. The toroidal
distribution of these two migration components is presented as well as a
discussion of the analysis technique for the deposited beryllium. Analysis is
made of the distribution of beryllium particulate matter deposited on the
inside of the vessel wall. Both a size distribution and spatial distribution
are presented.<p>

Abstract: The weight changes of Be tiles which functioned as a rail limiter in
the Impurity Study Experiment-B (ISX-B) for more than 3500 beam-heated
discharges have been determined. The net weight loss for the limiter is 2.0 g,
with the central tiles losing a total of 3.2 g, and the inboard tiles gaining
1.2 g. The weight loss is attributed primarily to the release of Be droplets as
a result of limiter surface melting. The weight gains result from an inward
flow of molten material along the limiter surface. The results indicate high
erosion (melt loss) with incomplete and nonuniform redeposition (melt flow) of
limiter material during periods of limiter melting.<p>

Abstract: Changes in plasma impurities and radiated power due to cleanup and
gettering during the beryllium limiter experiment are related to changes of the
surface composition of the torus walls and residual gases in the torus. Pulse
discharge cleaning was very effective in cleaning the ISX-B vacuum vessel after
installation of the beryllium limiter. As a result of discharge cleaning, areas
near the limiter were soon covered with a beryllium rich deposit containing
some iron, nickel, chromium, and titanium as well as oxygen, carbon, sulfur,
and nitrogen. Oxygen levels on the wall were reduced to below 10 at.%.
Materials transport during discharge cleaning was apparently due to sputtered
neutrals. Evaporation of beryllium from the limiter and subsequent deposition
on the torus walls caused by high power tokamak shots produced gettering of the
machine equal or better than that previously obtained with titanium or
chromium. This gettering by beryllium eliminated the need for further discharge
cleaning or other gettering. Beryllium transport in this case appears to be
mostly as ions in the plasma edge.<p>

Abstract: One of 12 beryllium tiles on a top rail limiter in the impurity study
experiment (ISX-B) tokamak was intentionally made radioactive. The migration of
the radioactivity due to melting, ablation, and general excoriation of the
radioactive tile was studied. Several hundred milligrams of material from the
radioactive tile were spread to the other tiles over the course of the
experiment, which consisted of more than 3000 tokamak discharges. A small
amount of activity was found on the bottom of the tokamak vacuum vessel. The
distribution of activity on the other limiter tiles showed a marked radially
inward directivity, although all of the tiles received some activity. The
possibility that some of the activity was the result of photo- and
electro-excitation by runaway electrons cannot be ruled out but probably cannot
account for the bulk of the effect.

Abstract: In JET, at full performance, the power injected through the ports
will reach 45 MW. From these 45 MW, 25 MW only will reach the center of the
plasma and will be efficient for the heating. This power will fall on the inner
wall of JET and on the limiters. The local thermal load on the limiters may
reach values as high as 10 MWm/sup -2/ for a duration of 10 s. In addition to
this, the material facing the plasma must be a 'low-Z material' in order to
limit the radiation from the impurities produced by sputtering and evaporation
of the limiter surface. The cooling foreseen uses the hypervapotron technique
(two phase system). The first cooled limiter on JET will be made of copper
covered by a layer of 1.5 mm nickel of 99.6% purity. This limiter could be
developed towards a low-Z one by replacing the nickel with a set of tiles of
carbon or beryllium. Uncooled limiters of graphite will also be installed on
JET. The concept of an antenna limiter which is being developed for the heating
of the JET plasma is another domain where the interaction of the plasma, the
electromagnetic waves and the antenna will play a dominant role.<p>

Abstract: Adequate impurity control has been achieved in short pulse tokamak
experiments using suitable limiter or divertor configurations. The aims of JET
will require effective impurity control with long pulses. The authors assess
the choice of nickel, graphite and beryllium for the limiter in JET and the
effectiveness of additional impurity control using a specified influx of neon
to cool the edge plasma. The limiter materials are distinguished with respect
to their ability, or otherwise, to allow plasmas with high central temperatures
and low limiter erosion. They concentrate on the effect of changes in the
particle transport and the effect of neon as a control gas to illustrate
important features of the assessment.<p>

Abstract: The processes producing impurities in tokamaks are still not well
understood, nor easy to predict in new machines. However, it is clear that
sputtering must be minimised. A model has recently been proposed which
discusses sputtering in terms of global parameters. The impurity level is
determined by a self-consistent energy balance between the input power, the
power radiated and the power conducted out. This model has been used as the
basis for comparison of three different limiter materials, nickel, carbon and
beryllium. Although some plasma parameters such as particle confinement time
are difficult to predict, the model allows the impurity behaviour to be readily
compared under a wide range of different conditions, including varying density
and additional heating. The effect of different levels of other impurities such
as oxygen can also be estimated.<p>

beryllium clad test specimen to normal reactor heat loads up to 1.0 MW/m/sup 2/
and continued thermal cycling at the maximum heat load to failure. First wall
and limiter design concepts from fusion reactor design studies (e.g. JET, TFCX,
STARFIRE, and FED/INTOR) in specifying both bare walls surfaces covered with
armor, such as beryllium tiles, have provided the basis for the specimen.<p>

Low-Z material for limiters and wall surfaces in JET: beryllium and carbon.<p>

Abstract: It is proposed to use in JET a single low-Z material for the belt
limiters and the walls to reduce impurity radiation losses to the lowest level.
The only practical materials are graphite and beryllium. Their relative merits
are compared. Graphite has better thermomechanical properties than beryllium,
but simulation experiments on beryllium carried out at Sandia National
Laboratory and in ISX-B have proved these properties sufficient for the belt
limiters. Recent measurements indicate that beryllium retains 2-3 times less
hydrogen than graphite. The ISX-B experiments have shown that beryllium has an
excellent gettering action also. The main drawback of beryllium is the toxicity
of its dust, but the control of beryllium dust is well within standard
industrial techniques. It is concluded that beryllium offers the best prospects
as a material for the JET belt limiters and walls.<p>

Abstract: A limiter with an effective area in contact with the plasma of about
16 m/sup 2/ is presently being manufactured for installation in 1987. This belt
limiter consists of two toroidal rings located above and below the equatorial
plane of the vacuum vessel. Each of the two rings comprises a structure with
water cooling pipes and fins welded to the pipes. The limiter material in
contact with the plasma (graphite or beryllium) is inserted between fins in the
form of tiles. The belt limiter is designed to handle up to 40 MW of total
power at flux densities of 3-5 MW/m/sup 2/ for 10 s and to permit rapid
exchange of different limiter materials. This paper describes the design and
manufacture of the belt limiter and the results of thermomechanical analysis
for different edge properties, power levels and shot repetition rates.<p>

Abstract: Beryllium is an attractive alternative to graphite for use as armor
material for plasma interactive components in fusion devices because of its low
atomic number, high strength, and good compatibility with hydrogen. However,
beryllium is susceptible to damage from cyclic thermal stresses because of its
high elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient. The authors have
performed 2-D elastic-plastic finite element stress analyses of prototype
beryllium limiter tiles for the JET project that are exposed to a surface heat
flux of 250 W/cm/sup 2/ for 15 second pulses. Plastic deformation was predicted
to occur at the heated surface during both the heating and cooling phases of
the cycle, thereby causing cyclic plastic strain. They also performed thermal
fatigue tests using a rastered electron beam to apply the heat load to
prototype limiter specimens. After 10000 thermal fatigue cycles, the only
damage of the beryllium tile was microcracking of the heated surface. The depth
of this microcracking, 4 mm, corresponds closely to the calculated depth of
cyclic plastic strain. These favorable results show that the operating
conditions for the JET limiter design can be extended into the regime of cyclic
plastic deformation without causing overall structural failure, despite the
formation of thermal fatigue cracks.<p>

Abstract: About 50% ( approximately 100 m/sup 2/) of the inner surface of the
JET vessel is now covered in graphite tiles. High purity, fine grain graphite
was chosen for areas during the flat top time of the discharge, typically 10 s,
the power loads do not exceed 5 MW m/sup -2/; carbon fibre reinforced graphite
was selected for areas where loads above 20 MW m/sup -2/ can be expected. All
other parts of the walls are carbonized. Fine grain high purity graphite has
been employed for the limiters from the very beginning of plasma operation.
With increasing heating power the limiter surface has gradually been increased
from approximately 1.2 to approximately 15 m/sup -2/, and the power handling
capability to 40 MW for ten seconds. This paper describes modifications to the
inner wall introduced during the various operation phases of JET, the different
materials used, their performance in the presence of plasmas, and their
influence on plasma properties. Operational limits, future developments and the
use of beryllium as an alternative to the present concept of an all graphite
machine are discussed.<p>

Abstract: During Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating in JET
(Joint European Torus) with beryllium gettered walls and RF antenna screens
both the global and local impurity influxes are significantly reduced as
compared to the previous operation. In particular oxygen is reduced by an order
of magnitude and the deuterium is efficiently pumped. The deuterium recycling
R/sub D/&lt;1 except at the onset of RF pulse (1&lt;R/sub D/&lt;1.1) for t=0.75
s, indicating modest desorption. This provides the density control. Except for
the lowest densities, Z/sub eff/=2 at P/sub RF/=10 MW is routinely achieved. At
comparable densities, P/sub RAD//P/sub TOT/ is 30-50% lower. If we assume that
the long term evolution of the beryllium signal at the antenna screen is due to
erosion, rather than coverage by carbon, the authors estimate the corresponding
influx in monopole configuration (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) to be Phi /sub
Be/SCREEN=1.16*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ from an effective area
A/sub EFF/=0.5 m/sup 2/. At the same coupling resistance the beryllium influx
scales with the RF power of the antenna and with the plasma density. With
dipoles (k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/), the influx is reduced by more than a factor 3.
The contribution of antenna influxes to Z/sub eff/ is small, Delta Z/sub
eff//sup Be/=0.08 and Delta Z/sub eff//sup Ni/=0.05 at P/sub RF/=5 MW.<p>

Comparison between beryllium and graphite as materials for JET limiters and

Abstract: JET has always been operated with graphite limiters. Carbonisation
has been performed from time to time resulting in a temporary reduction of
Z/sub eff/. However, the latest results at high power (up to 30 MW) indicate
that in most cases the impurity content in the plasma is too large to reach
near reactor conditions. To reduce the impurity content to a level acceptable
in a reactor, it is proposed to use beryllium as a material for the limiters
and wall surfaces in JET. This proposal was first made four years ago on the
basis of a report comparing the relative merits of beryllium and carbon. The
effects of impurities on the plasma performance are discussed. The physical and
chemical properties of graphite and beryllium are compared. A simple model for
the impurity production at the plasma edge is presented.<p>

Effect of beryllium evaporation on the performance of ICRH on JET.<p>

Abstract: Beryllium films (150 to 300AA) have been evaporated on all JET
in-vessel components (carbon limiters, nickel screen, inconel walls). Immediate
and lasting improvements of the plasma have been observed in all plasma
regimes. The authors concentrate on the results obtained with ICRH and NBI on
the density limit and on H-mode plasmas which are particularly sensitive to
impurity release. Specific effects produced by RF waves are reduced to a
negligible level when the following 3 aspects are combined: beryllium
evaporation, dipole phasing and correct screen angle. The density limit
obtained with ICRF is now identical to NBI heated cases and substantially
higher than the values obtained in the pre-beryllium phase. Long H-modes (1.3
s) have been obtained with RF alone. The H mode confinement is similar to that
of NBI cases. In limiter plasmas Z/sub eff/ decreased to 1.2-1.4 at high
density and for 10 MW input power. The results are related to oxygen gettering,
suppression of nickel sputtering from the antenna screens and to the use of
dipole phasing.<p>

Abstract: Summarizes results from the initial operation of the JET Tokamak with
a beryllium first wall. JET was first operated with an evaporated Be coating on
the walls and graphite limiters in June 1989. In August the graphite limiter
tiles were replaced with Be tiles, and a three week experimental campaign was
conducted in September/October. In the first phase oxygen was reduced to a
negligible level and the carbon flux halved. In the second phase, for limiter
mode operation, carbon was reduced by another factor of five, and Be became the
dominant impurity. High power, long pulse additionally heated limiter mode
discharges with Z/sub eff/&lt;1.5 were achieved, and density limits were
increased by a factor of up to two. ICRF produced H-modes were obtained in
X-point operation (double null). The combination of Be gettering with new
operational procedures to delay the strong influx of carbon from the X-point
tiles enabled the achievement of record fusion parameters in H-mode discharges
including a transient n/sub d/T/sub i/ tau /sub E/ value of 9*10/sup 20/ m/sup
-3/ keVs, corresponding to a Q/sub DT/ equivalent of about 0.8.<p>

Abstract: A variety of materials have been used in JET for wall protection and
high heat flux components. The machine initially operated with metallic walls,
but the inner surface of the vessel ( approximately 200 m/sup 2/) is now
covered to more than 50% with fine grain and carbon fibre reinforced graphite
tiles. The remaining wall area is carbonized. The authors present the materials
behaviour in the presence of plasma; their influence on plasma properties; the
conditioning methods employed; a discussion of future enhancements of inner
wall components and the planned use of beryllium as an alternative to the
present concept of an all graphite machine. It is essential for the further
development of fusion that the experience gained in JET is transferred to the
next machine, which should produce a burning plasma on a scale comparable to a
reactor. Such a proposed machine is a single null divertor tokamak with the
following parameters: 3 m plasma minor radius, 7.5 m major radius, elongation
approximately 2, aspect ratio approximately 2.5, toroidal field, 4.5 T, pulse
duration 2000 s and fusion power up to 5 GW. The underlying physics for the
choice of these parameters and the basic design is presented.<p>

with ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) at JET. Comparison of the effects
of ICRH on the edge is presented for operation with all carbon limiters, and
for operation with a beryllium layer evaporated on the walls and limiters of
JET. The behaviour of the SOL parameters is similar for both cases, although
edge temperatures tend to be lower in the Be case. Measurements with probes
between the belt limiters and close to the ICRH antennas show that the edge
parameters in this region are strongly influenced by the vicinity of an active
antenna.<p>

Abstract: JET is investigating beryllium as material for walls and limiters.
Studies were carried out with initially a thin layer of beryllium evaporated
onto the walls of the machine, later in addition the graphite material of the
belt limiter was exchanged against beryllium. The use of this material was
generally beneficial for the plasma behaviour. Combined with a reduction in the
oxygen content, strong pumping of hydrogen isotopes was found which allowed JET
to widen considerably the operational space with respect to ion temperatures,
densities and plasma purity. In this paper a comparison of the plasma
performance with graphite and beryllium will be presented. The author discusses
especially the impurity behaviour with respect to fluxes, concentrations,
effective charge and dilution, and reports on density limits, disruption
behaviour, wall pumping, hydrogen isotope retention, and the power handling
capability of the beryllium limiter in the present design. Examples of improved
plasma performance are given.<p>

Abstract: The 1989 JET experimental campaign assessed the properties of
beryllium as a plasma-facing material. This campaign had three phases: (i) an
all-graphite phase to recommission the tokamak, (ii) a phase with beryllium
evaporation on graphite to isolate the effect of oxygen gettering and (iii) a
beryllium limiter phase. Beryllium evaporation removed oxygen from the plasma
and reduced carbon concentrations by a factor of two. Strong deuteron pumping
was obtained which resulted in a significant, long-term improvement in density
control and eliminated the deconditioning effect of disruptions. The use of
beryllium limiters reduced the plasma radiation, increased the density limit,
reduced the incidence of disruptions and enhanced the deuteron pumping. In the
beryllium phases impurity influxes were lower during ICRH heating which
permitted the first ICRH-only H-modes. The deuteron pumping allowed heavy gas
fuelling to be used to reduce impurity levels of limiter and X-point plasmas.<p>

Abstract: During high-power operation in JET, a sudden and large increase in
the flux of impurities (carbon and beryllium) entering the discharge is often
observed shortly after the start of additional heating, especially at the low
plasma density required for high ion temperature and fusion yield. This influx
leads to a degradation of the plasma performance due to an increase of the
impurity concentration and associated deuterium dilution, reduced beam
penetration and a reduction in the ion temperature. There is good evidence that
these influxes result from a small fraction of the total area of the carbon
(beryllium) surfaces in contact with the plasma (tile edges particularly)
reaching temperatures where radiation-enhanced sublimation and thermal
sublimation for carbon and evaporation for beryllium become important. The
authors report on measurements of the phenomena observed during inner-wall and
carbon or beryllium belt limiter discharges both with and without beryllium
gettering.<p>

Abstract: Deuterium recycling during and after ohmic limiter discharges in the
Be-phase of JET are compared with that during the C-phase. For the Be-phase,
effective transport parameters for diffusion and recombination of deuterium at
surfaces of in-vessel components of JET are derived using plasma discharge data
only. This and the analysis of the outgassing behaviour after the discharge
suggest that deuterium release is controlled by recombination with D/k (D is
the diffusion, k the recombination coefficient) of about 10/sup 21/-10/sup 22/
m/sup -2/, larger than expected from laboratory measurements.<p>

Abstract: Scaling of edge particle flux and temperature with central density in
JET has been studied in ohmic and auxiliary heated beryllium limiter
discharges, using Langmuir probes in the edge. Data has been obtained over a
much wider density range than previously, and it is found that flux density
scales almost linearly with central density. The edge temperature, on the other
hand, is almost constant at low densities, but falls rapidly when gas puffing
is used in the edge to achieve high densities. A global power balance assuming
T/sub i/=T/sub e/ suggests a shortfall in power to the edge, particularly at
low densities, suggesting T/sub i/&gt;T/sub e/. The consequence of high T/sub
i/ on limiter sputtering is considered.<p>

Abstract: During 1989, following a brief all carbon phase, JET was operated
with an evaporated beryllium film on all the plasma facing surfaces and then,
in a third phase, with bulk beryllium used for the belt limiters and one set of
antenna protection tiles. Subsequent analysis of wall components and long term
samples (LTS) using beta backscatter and ion beam analysis has been conducted
to determine the condition of the first wall and its deuterium inventory after
beryllium operation. Ex-situ analysis of components where deposition occurs
during operation shows mixed carbon and beryllium layers with an approximate
ratio 1:1 and some localised higher Z components. The deuterium inventory
situation is little changed by the introduction of beryllium. Similar surface
levels of deuterium, approximately 1*10/sup 22/ atoms m/sup -2/, have been seen
for both carbon and beryllium belt limiter tiles.<p>

Abstract: During ICRF heating in JET with Be gettering and Be-belt limiters the
impurity influxes are significantly reduced as compared to the all carbon case.
The dominating 'global' influxes originate at the limiters and wall and are
consequence of the increased power flow in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The 'RF
specific' influxes from the torus internal surfaces, far away from the antenna,
are not observed. Z/sub eff/=1.5-2 is routinely achieved at power levels up to
P/sub rf/=15 MW and with Be limiters even at densities (n/sub e/)=(1-2)*10/sup
19/ m/sup -3/. The dilution is n/sub d//n/sub e/&gt;0.8. Z/sub eff/ scales
inversely with density and weakly with RF power, (Z/sub eff/-1) varies as P/sub
RF//sup 0.4-0.6//(n/sub e/)/sup 0.9-1.1/. P/sub rad//P/sub tot/ is 50% lower
than previously observed. Even at densities (n/sub e/)=(4-6)*10/sup 19/ m/sup
-3/ the radiated fraction is below 30% of input power. In the case of Be
gettering and carbon limiters the dominant impurity is carbon. With the Be
limiters it is replaced by Be. The oxygen is eliminated in both cases. The

Abstract: The effect of different fuelling scenarios (gas fuelling and pellets)
on the scrape-off layer parameters is presented for ohmic and additionally
heated limiter discharges at JET, during operation with Be-coated carbon
limiters and all-Be limiters. The carbon and beryllium impurity production is
calculated using edge parameters measured with Langmuir probes, and compared
with the central impurity content (Z/sub eff/). The local particle diffusion
coefficient is also calculated. For all the different dynamic processes
studied, a correlation is found between electron edge temperature and edge
density, which does not depend on the fuelling or heating scenario used. A
cooling of the edge is observed with increasing edge density, and the impurity
production by sputtering decreases for edge temperatures below 20 eV. Strong
gas and pellet fuelling are found to be very efficient in controlling Z/sub
eff/.<p>

Abstract: JET has operated with beryllium limiters such that up to 180 MJ
coupled to the plasma. Approximately 2-4% of the surface of the limiter has
been melted near the plasma contact point. Another 10-15% of the surface shows
evidence of edge heating. some 5% of tiles have been subjected to abnormal
loads at points distant from the contact area. Damage shows strong correlation
of localised heating of the toroidal field ripple. Edge heating rates of 260
Mw/m/sup 2/ have not caused gross mechanical failure of the limiter. The
mechanical damage comprises fatigue cracks analogous to those due to sustained
loading at low power levels.<p>

Abstract: The sputtering yields for deuterium on carbon and beryllium at the
belt limiters in JET are determined with an OMA spectrometer and/or
photomultiplier detectors with optical interference filters. The apparent
sputter yield for carbon in the absence of oxygen from 4-10%, and for beryllium
the yield from 6-30%. A CCD camera with optical interference filters has been
used to record the 2-D spatial distributions of the BeI (825.4 nm) line
radiation at the belt limiters. Clearly resolved individual tile images are
observed, and the dependence of the toroidal and poloidal impurity
distributions on plasma density and input power has been investigated.
Transport of the Be neutrals has been modelled with the LIM impurity code over
the plasma density range (0.35-2.50)*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/ for 3 MA ohmic
discharges, and good agreement with the experimental data has been obtained.<p>

Abstract: The authors report a study of the impurity influx from a carbon probe
that was introduced to the edge of the plasma in JET. The measured dependence
of carbon influx on surface temperature is compared with results from a model
of the plasma boundary. The spatial distribution, in the region around the
probe, of spectral emission from low ionisation stages of carbon are compared
with results from the Monte Carlo transport code, LIM. In both models, measured
values of local plasma parameters were used. In plasma with Be-gettered carbon
limiters, carbon influx from the probe increased rapidly when the surface
temperature exceeded 1200 degrees C. Experiments with beryllium metal limiter
showed that under these conditions, a layer of mainly beryllium was deposited
on the probe surface, and this suppressed the carbon influx until higher
surface temperatures were reached.<p>

Abstract: Provide experimental data on the recycling of hydrogen isotopes in
beryllium. The ratio D/2 K/sub r/(m/sup -2/) (D: diffusion coefficient, K/sub
r/: recombination rate coefficient), which characterises the hydrogen transient
pumping behaviour of the materials, has been measured for hydrogen and
deuterium in Be as a function of temperature, in the range
373&lt;or=T(K)&gt;or=553. D/2K/sub r/ was found to be approximately=10/sup 20/
m/sup -2/ and depend weakly on the Be temperature (activation energies of
approximately=0.1 eV). This value of D/2K/sub r/ was then used as an input
parameter to the PERI code to simulate the plasma deuterium inventory behaviour
assuming that the main processes governing the recycling during the discharge
are diffusion in the bulk and recombination on the surface of beryllium. The
deuterium fluxes from the plasma-facing surfaces are simulated with good
accuracy. The simulation of the deuterium plasma inventory is somewhat worse,
although a satisfactory agreement between the calculated experimental time
evolution is achieved.<p>

Abstract: Surface probes have been exposed at JET with all-carbon walls, when
beryllium was evaporated onto graphite limiters, and with beryllium limiters.
The aims have been to study the impurity content in the scrape-off, erosion and
deposition, and the pumping of deuterium by codeposition with carbon and
beryllium. Thermally activated erosion makes it difficult to study time
resolved erosion close to the LCFS. In the all-carbon machine, the carbon
density in the outboard scrapeoff between the belts was estimated to
approximately 20% of the deuterium. With a fresh Be coating on the limiters,
carbon in the SOL was initially suppressed, but increased from discharge to
discharge. The D/C ratio in codeposition layers was three times larger with
Be-evaporation than in all-carbon conditions. Edge profiles determined from
impurity deposition became flatter during RF heating and current ramp down.<p>

Abstract: The evaporation of beryllium inside the JET (Joint European Torus)
has changed considerably the behavior of the machine and the plasma
performance. Recovery from disruption was fast and density control was easily
achieved. The operational space with respect to Z/sub eff/-values, dilution,
density, and temperature could be considerably extended. The dilution was
reduced and consequently the fusion parameter was doubled to 5*10/sup 20/ m/sup
-3/ keV. The equivalent Q/sub DT/-value, albeit nonstationary, approaches 0.5.
Beryllium tiles were installed on the belt limiter, requiring for the first
time an intervention into the vessel with full biological protection. The
control of the beryllium environment was successful and installation times did
not require more manhours than previously for in-vessel work. Experimental
results from operation with the beryllium limiter are not yet available.
Preliminary findings indicate the possibility of obtaining very low Z/sub
eff/-values (&lt;1.3-1.8) for additionally heated discharges. Energies of up to
180 MJ were deposited on the limiter, twice the amount which can be taken by
the graphite limiter before the occurrence of the carbon bloom. At the edges of
the beryllium limiter tiles, hot spots develop (as was also observed for the
graphite).<p>

Abstract: Four beryllium evaporators were fitted onto the JET vessel during
March 1989. These evaporators are planned to give the first introduction of
beryllium into the JET machine to study the effect of using beryllium as a
first wall material. Over 200 hours operational experience with such an
evaporator had been gained on a test bed facility in which the evaporation
rate, radial evaporant distribution and head operating temperature had been
determined. The results obtained on this facility with two different head
materials, sintered S-65B and vacuum cast beryllium are described. The test
vessel has also been used to conduct beryllium wall pumping experiments using
the 'Langmuir effect'. The initial results of these experiments are
described.<p>

Comparisons of the current decay during carbon-bounded and beryllium bounded
disruptions in JET.<p>
JET Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, Dec. 1990.<p>
Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: Presents results of preliminary investigations of the current decay
phase in JET major disruptions, where the plasma is bounded by beryllium
limiters and a beryllium gettered wall. The average decay time of the current
is 175 ms, about 14 times longer than the initial decay time for carbon-bonded
disruptions. Vertical stability is often lost before the current has decayed
significantly in Be-bounded disruptions, leading to substantial net vertical
forces on the vacuum vessel. Subsequent interaction of the plasma with the top
or bottom divertor tiles leads to increased impurity contamination, cooling of
the plasma and a second phase of more rapid current decay. No runaway current
plateau is observed for carbon-bounded x-point disruptions, although in some
cases a small hesitation in the current decay is observed that is coincident
with the hard X-ray and photoneutron signals associated with runaway electrons.
The total photoneutron yield in x-point disruptions is at least 10 times
smaller than that measured from limiter discharges. Both x-point and limiter
disruptions in Be-bounded discharges show no runaway production, except for a
few cases where carbon contamination is also suspect. Direct ECE measurements
indicate the temperature T/sub d/ following thermal quench in Be-bounded
disruptions is at least 30 eV, and often higher. Plasmas of such temperatures
have resistive decay times consistent with the observed current decay rates.
The lack of runaway production is also consistent with these temperatures as,
for n/sub e/=1*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/, the runaway production rate for T/sub
d/=30 eV is estimated to be a factor 10/sup -6/ less than that at 5 eV. Even
greater reductions are estimated for higher densities.<p>

Assessment of beryllium Faraday screens of the JET ICRF antennas. JET<p>
Joint Undertaking, Abingdon, UK, July 1991.<p>
Pub type:  Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: The installation of beryllium (Be) Faraday screens (FS) at the ICRF
antennas in JET resulted in elimination of the RF specific effects on the
plasma boundary by the impurity influx originating at the screens. In dipole
phasing, k/sub II/=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is for all purposes negligible. In
monopole (k/sub II/=0 m/sup -1/) the beryllium influx does not exceed phi /sub
Be//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms MW/sup -1/ s/sup -1/ and corresponding delta
Z/sub eff//P/sub RF/&lt;0.005 MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of the phi
/sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopole phasing) on plasma density, antenna voltage,
antenna phasing and the angle between FS elements and the magnetic field in the
boundary B(a)=B/sub theta /(a)+B/sub T/(a) confirm that the release mechanism
is the sputtering by the ions accelerated in the RF-enhanced Bohm-Debye sheaths
forming at the front face of the FS. When the angle between FS and the B(a) is
approximately=22 degrees the fraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna,
dissipated at the screen, can reach 40%. At high antenna voltage arcing across
the FS can occur. With dipole phasing the heating efficiency is not degraded
even with the large angle and all the power coupled by the antenna is absorbed
at the resonance position near the plasma centre. The open screen design did
not introduce any disadvantages. The experience from the JET operation at
powers up to 22 MW shows that, if the necessary conditions are met, i.e., RF
rectification is minimised and material with the low sputtering coefficients at
energies 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is eliminated.<p>

Abstract: The JET ICRF antennas, equipped with beryllium (Be) Faraday screens
(FS), can be operated in such a way that the RF specific effects on the plasma
boundary, by the impurity influx originating at the screens, are reduced to a
negligible level. In dipole phasing, k/sub ///=7 m/sup -1/, the influx is for
all purposes negligible. In monopole phasing (k/sub ///=0 m/sup -1/) the
beryllium influx does not exceed phi /sub Be//sup FS/=1*10/sup 19/ atoms.MW/sup
-1/.s/sup -1/ and the corresponding delta Z/sub eff//P/sub RF /is &lt;0.005
MW/sup -1/. The observed dependences of phi /sub Be//sup FS/ (in monopole
phasing) on plasma density antenna voltage, antenna phasing, and the angle
between FS elements and the magnetic field in the boundary, B(a)=B/sub theta
/(a)+B/sub T/(a), confirm that the release mechanism is sputtering by ions
accelerated in the RF enhanced Bohm-Debye sheaths forming at the front face of
the FS. When the angle between FS and B(a) is approximately=22 degrees , the
fraction of the RF power radiated by the antenna, dissipated at the screen, can
reach 40%. At high antenna voltage, arcing across the FS can occur. With dipole
phasing the heating efficiency is not degraded, even with the large angle, and
all the power coupled by the antenna is absorbed at the resonance position near
the plasma centre. The open screen design did not introduce any disadvantages.
The experience from JET operation at powers of up to 22 MW shows that, if the
necessary conditions are met, i.e. if RF rectification is minimized, antennas
are phased as dipoles and material with low sputtering coefficients at energies
of 0.5-1 keV is used, then the influx from the FS is, for all practical
purposes, eliminated.<p>

Abstract: The measures detailed in the 'Code of Practice for the Safe use of
Beryllium at JET' are summarized. JETs (Joint European Torus') policy of
segregating beryllium related work into BeCAs (beryllium controlled areas) has
ensured that the general workplace (torus hall, assembly hall, etc.) remain
free of airborne and surface contamination, and hence no safety precautions
have had to be adopted in these areas. There have been no beryllium incidents
leading to airborne concentrations in excess of 0.2 mu gm/sup -3/ outside of
any BeCA. Aerial discharges of beryllium have generally been undetectable and
have never approached the limit of 0.01 mu gm/sup -3/. No cases of acute or
chronic beryllium intoxication have been diagnosed; some minor cuts have been
sustained in BeCAs (no contamination of the wound was found on samples) and no
treatment has been required beyond conventional first-aid procedures. In-vessel
work has continued to be possible despite high levels of surface contamination
and variable air concentrations, but the logistics support for in-vessel
operation has increased very noticeably as a result of beryllium.<p>

Abstract: The dependence of impurity production and retention on the divertor
density, on the power flow into this region as well as on the X-point to target
distance are investigated. Model predictions suggest a good impurity retention
above a certain divertor (scrape-off) density threshold, which is dependent on
heating power. Pre-programmed midplane or X-point gas puffs were used to scan
the density, as well as to avoid the depletion of particles form the divertor
and the scrape-off during H-modes. The gas puffs reduce T/sub e/ and increase
N/sub e/ in particular at the outer strike zone. In general the Be as well as
the C influx increases with density, which is understood from the T/sub
e/(T/sub i/) dependence of the sputtering yields. The impurity retention shows
the expected improvement with increasing scrape-off (divertor) density as well
as with increasing X-point to target distance (connection length).<p>

Abstract: The radial distributions of the low charge states of Be near the JET
beryllium belt limiters have been measured experimentally. When interpreted
with an impurity production/transport code, these measurements elucidate the
plasma behaviour near the limiter, and the source and sink action of the
limiter on the impurity ions. The authors have considered 3 MA ohmically
heated, limiter discharges with n/sub e/=1-4*10/sup 19/ m/sup -3/. A model
which satisfactorily reproduces the measured profiles required the following
assumptions: (a) an n/sub e/(r) profile just inside the LCFS (0 to
approximately 10 cm radially inwards) which extrapolated smoothly from the SOL
(probe) measurements; (b) a T/sub e/(r) outer edge profile which extrapolated
smoothly from the core (ECE) measurements; (c) a cross-field impurity diffusion
coefficient D/sub perpendicular to / approximately= 0.5 m/sup 2//s in the outer
edge; (d) no strong inward or outward pinch action in the outer edge; (e)
impurity production by physical sputtering, rather than by evaporation; (f)
sputtering due to parallel plasma flow onto the limiters; no significant direct
perpendicular flow onto the limiters, as has been observed for larger
limiters.<p>

Abstract: The 1991/92 JET experimental campaign assessed the performance of
three different toroidally continuous X-point target plates. The main
differences were in the tile material, beryllium and carbon, and the presence
of exposed edges. These three configurations have been tested up to power
levels in excess in 22 MW and with gas fuelling at the X-point and in the
midplane. With the beryllium a radiating divertor was achieved by puffing
deuterium into the X-point region, while rapid ELMs resulted from deuterium
puffing on the carbon target. The investigation into the importance of small
edges, up to 1.5 mm, yielded some interesting results. Although the surface
temperature rise was substantially reduced by eliminating exposed tile edges,
the onset of the carbon bloom was not delayed by a similar amount. In this
paper a model is presented which can explain this and other features of the
bloom.<p>

Analysis of outgassing after JET-discharges under beryllium first wall

Pub type:  Practical; Experimental.<p>
<p>
Abstract: During the beryllium phase of JET, hydrogen (H/sub 2/, HD, D/sub 2/),
hydrocarbon (C/sub x/H/sub y/) and CO outgassing after discharges has been
analysed by means of mass spectroscopy and Penning gauges. The analysis has
been performed over a period of up to 3000 seconds after ohmic and additionally
heated limiter and X-point discharges. The temporal behaviour of hydrogenic
outgassing could be characterized by a uniform power law t/sup -n/ with
n=0.73+or-0.1 which is independent of plasma operation parameters. This result
is discussed in view of possible transport and retention mechanisms in and
deuterium release mechanisms from plasma facing surfaces. It is concluded that
not a single but several mechanisms can explain the release behaviour. However,
one of the most plausible explanations is accumulation of hydrogen in limiters
and walls. Outgassing of hydrocarbon and CO were significantly lower under
beryllium wall conditions as compared to the earlier all carbon wall
conditions.<p>

Abstract: Single null X-point discharges having exactly the same main plasma
parameters were performed on the C and on the Be target tiles in order to
compare the two materials under similar conditions. Low power L-mode, H-mode
and hot-iron H-mode pulses were used in this comparison. The impurity
production when using a Be target is a factor of 3 higher than at the C target
under similar plasma conditions. The power handling capability of Be is
approximately a factor of 1.5 lower than that of C. In radiative divertor (gas
target) experiments, however, Be seems to be superior to C. This may be due to
the fact that the maximum Be radiation occurs at a plasma temperature of 1.5 eV
compared with 7 eV in the case of C.<p>

Abstract: After plasma operation in 1991 samples were cut from C and Be tiles
of the JET vessel walls, limiters, and X-point tiles along a poloidal cross
section in octant 4W, and the surface layers were analysed by the MeV ion beam
methods NRA, PIXE, and RBS to determine the D and metal impurity distributions.
The amount of trapped deuterium ranges from 5*10/sup 15/ to 5*10/sup 17/
D/cm/sup 2/, metal impurities such as Ni, Cr, and Fe are in the range of 10/sup
15/ to 3*10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/, Cl in the range of 10/sup 16/ to 10/sup
18//cm/sup 2/, K and Ca in the range of 10/sup 15/ to 10/sup 16//cm/sup 2/ and
Ti about 10/sup 15//cm/sup 2/. Except for Cl, all measured concentrations are a
factor of up to about ten lower than those observed on JET walls tiles before
Be evaporation and Be wall components were used. This observation is in
agreement with the reduced impurity concentrations measured in the JET plasma.
The D and impurity distributions along the X-point tiles were analysed in some
detail. Generally, the deuterium trapping and impurity deposition show minima
in areas where erosion dominates and amounts to a factor of about ten times
larger inbetween.<p>

Abstract: A long pulse JET divertor requires the production of beryllium clad
copper alloy hypervapotron target plates. Vacuum brazing of beryllium poses a
number of problems relating to the stable beryllium oxide and ready formation
of brittle intermetallics. Induction brazing offers some advantages and a rig
has been developed for producing vapotron test target plates for power load
testing in the Neutral Beam Test Bed. The brazed components have survived over
1000 shots at 13 MW/m/sup 2/ with an ultimate power loading capability up to 17
MW/m/sup 2/. These results have been interpreted with respect to both localised
stresses and thermal fatigue at the interface. This study analyses the power
handling capability with respect to instantaneous heat flux failure, localised
hot spots from target plate deflections and high cycle fatigue with a view to
establishing an optimum unit size.<p>

Abstract: Since the introduction of beryllium (Be) into the JET machine in 1989
the occupational hygiene screening for Be contamination has been a key feature
of JET health physics tasks. Beryllium dust is toxic and if inhaled can result
in severe acute and chronic conditions which have been well documented.
Techniques to rapidly assess Be contamination have been investigated. A laser
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system, in which a laser is used to
vapourise Be from a filter paper prior to analysis was found to be inaccurate
due to particle size differences between the calibration and JET samples. A
prototype on-line sampler although rapid was found to be insufficiently
sensitive. The lack of a practical direct monitoring method for assessing JET
Be contamination complicates the procedures required for the safe handling of
the material. The requirements of the UK Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations have necessitated the provision of on-site Be analysis
facilities to provide the information necessary to protect the work force and
demonstrate compliance with these regulations. The technique described here
involves the dissolution of filter paper samples bearing Be dust in sulphuric
and nitric acids and the analysis of the resulting liquor by atomic absorption
spectrometry and is recommended by the UK Health and Safety Executive as
suitable for assessing personnel exposure to Be.<p>
