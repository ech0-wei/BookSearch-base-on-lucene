RM60m for SHL"s expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Ishun P. Ahmad

SHL Consolidated Bhd has allocated RM60 million for the expansion of its
brick and quarry operations in its scheme to develop them as core
activities in future.
  Executive director, Mr Yap Teiong Choon told reporters yesterday after
SHL's annual general meeting that from the RM60 million, RM40 million will
be invested for the construction of a third fully automated brick plant in
Sepang while RM10 million will used for the upgrading of its first brick
plant.
  "The remaining RM10 million is set aside for the expansion of a third
quarry plant which will increase the present annual production capacity of
3 million tonnes by another 1.5 million tonnes giving a total annual
production capacity of 4.5 million tonnes," Yap said.
  The third plant, which is expected to be installed by 1998, will add-on
another annual production capacity of 100 million pieces of bricks to its
current annual capacity of 200 million pieces of bricks.
  The new plant is expected to start construction in the third quarter of
next year.
  The upgrading of the first plant involves the construction of a new
tunnel kiln and extension of a new factory space together with further
add-on of new equipment.
  Yap said the expansion will see it to be the largest manufacturer of
bricks in Malaysia and a major player in the quarry business which will
help improve future profits.
  "From our experience in the quarry business, we foresee the new quarry
plant will generate about RM10 million annual profits," Yap said.
  Meanwhile, Yap said that SHL is in the process of negotiating a number
of big projects but declined to disclose the amount and when the projects
are expected to be finalised.

Across the board: Hefty rises on second board may elicit queries

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Adi Satria

HEFTY rises in the prices of Second Board stocks may be sweet for those
individuals who happen to own the stocks but for the companies concerned,
a sudden surge in prices and volume traded invariably elicit queries from
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).
  This is as it should be because of the danger of small capitalised
stocks being manipulated by syndicates which if left unchecked, would lead
to a sudden plunge in prices - and volume - and those who would suffer
most would be most likely the individual retail players.
  Of course, not all individuals who buy second board stocks lose money
because if they had bought the stocks sometime ago when prices were lower,
they would still stand to gain if prices drop sharply.
  A retail player who bought his shares in a second board company when the
Second Board Index was at the 300 or 400 point level.
  However, given the small number of shares floating around among the
small capitalised stocks on the second board, it would not have taken much
buying power for prices to jump up over the last few weeks.
  What this means is that if many players had been chasing stocks on the
way up, many of them would have bought them at the higher end of the price
range.
  Those who play second board stocks would have realised by now that if a
person buys second board stock to keep it and then wait for something to
happen which would push up the price, he may have to wait for quite
sometime. Maybe even a long time because there are some second board
stocks which are thinly traded and their prices barely move.
  Therefore, the person who buys a second board stock may see his money
tied in the market for an uncomfortably long time because it is not easy
to sell his stock if he needs money urgently.
  In short, the lack of liquidity among the small second board stocks is a
drawback for those may want to buy stocks when the market is "quiet." It
may be so quiet that he will not be able to find a buyer for his stock at
a reasonable price.
  The net effect of this lack of liquidity among second board stocks is
that  many punters prefer to indulge in buying and selling of second board
stocks when there is already a build-up in the volume so that there is
sufficient liquidity for him to get in fast and get out even faster when
there is a need to do so.
  Unfortunately, given the small capitalisation, by the time there is a
surge in the trading volume of second board stocks - and thus in their
liquidity - their prices would have shot up to quite a high level.
  The upshot of this is that it is at this time when many punters jump
into the second board stocks, thus ending up buying the stocks at
dangerously high prices. However, after a sharp pullback, second board
stocks need not necessarily continue to slide.
  Like all cycles, second board stocks have their ups and downs, and they
can come back again - the only question is when they will make a comeback.
Many punters will, of course, hope that they do not have to wait too long
for their comeback.

AMALGAMATED Industrial Steel Bhd (AISB) has aborted its 100 per cent
proposed acquisition of Prisma Meridian Sdn Bhd, Infostas Engineering Sdn
Bhd and a three-for-five rights issue of 61.55 million new AISB shares of
RM0.50 each at an issue price of RM5.50 per share.
  This is because the directors have been informed that Teknologi Tenaga
Perlis Sdn Bhd (TTP)'s right to finance, construct, own and operate a gas-
fuelled combined cycle power station of 650MW in Perlis has been made void
as it has been awarded to Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdn Bhd.
  As a result, the company has decided to abort the proposed acquisition
and consequently not to raise equity finance required through the proposed
rights issue to invest in TTP.

Hwa Tai ventures into building

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Elena Shamsuddin

BISCUITS manufacturer, Hwa Tai Food Industries Bhd is said to be
diversifying into the construction sector following the recent acquisition
of a stake in the company by Mancon Bhd.
  With this new venture, Hwa Tai is hoping that in the long term,
contribution from the construction segment will "be the same" with its
biscuits manufacturing, said a source.
  At the moment, said the source, Hwa Tai is doing earthworks at a cost of
RM15 million, for a 2,000-unit medium cost residential development project
by Mancon in Lukut.
  The source who is close to the company also pointed out that Hwa Tai,
with no landbanks, is on the look out for more land to be developed in
East Malaysia as well as in Peninsular Malaysia.
  Hwa Tai, which is listed on the second board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) is also aiming for a transfer to the main board in the
next two to three years, said the source.
  On Hwa Tai's biscuits manufacturing, he said that Hwa Tai plans to build
one factory each in a 4.5ha piece of land in Senai, Johore and an 8.1ha
land in Bukit Rakit, Terengganu.
  He said Hwa Tai has submitted layout plans to the respective state
authorities, and approval for the land in Senai is expected to be obtained
earlier than the approval for Bukit Rakit.

DVB meets local, foreign demand

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Lokman Mansor

DELLOYD Ventures Bhd (DVB), manufacturer and distributor of automotive
parts and accessories, en route for a listing on the Main Board of the
Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, has forecast a pre-tax profit of RM29.27
million for the year ending December 31 1996.
  The forecast includes net earnings per share of 34.75 sen, and proposed
gross dividend of 6 per cent worth RM2.73 million, according to its
prospectus released on Saturday.
  The 10-year-old DVB Group expects its business relationship with
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton), its largest client, to
strengthen further, following the setting up of DVB's factory-cum-
warehouse at the DRB-Hicom Proton City project in Perak.
  "About 66 per cent of the group's turnover last year is attributable to
Proton and EON Trading Sdn Bhd. Orders have been increasing, including
those requiring production to commence only in 1997," DVB managing
director Tee Boon Kee said in an interview.
  He said although the group presently commits a significant part of its
production facilities to Proton, there exists a ready OEM market which is
constantly requesting the group to increase its current supplies of
automotive parts and accessories.
  "Efforts to expand and diversify our customer base is expected to result
in sales increasing to such an extent that percentage of sales to Proton,
although expected to follow a growing trend, will decrease in future.
Everything will balance out," Tee added.
  In line with its overseas marketing strategy, the DVB group is already
seeking to expand its export customer base through the manufacture and
supply of radio antennas to Thailand for Toyota cars, and the manufacture
and supply of automotive parts and accessories for PT Timor Putra
Nasional, the Indonesian national car manufacturer.
  "Our products are already exported there. Eventually, we plan to set up
manufacturing facilities in Indonesia," he said.
  DVB's list of international direct export customers include countries in
South-East Asia and West Asia, Pakistan, the US, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, New
Zealand, Brazil and Fiji.
  Tee said the group also has plans to set up overseas joint venture
companies to strengthen its international marketing and distribution
networks with both its existing and new potential customers.
  DVB's other future plans include diversifying its product base for the
manufacturing of new automotive parts and accessories. These include
mirror lens for interior and exterior view mirrors, and door latches for
cars through a technical assistance and license agreement with a German
company.

George Town to diversify

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 7

By Ishun P. Ahmad

GEORGE Town Holdings Bhd expects to not only expand its current activities
but also to diversify into film studios, entertainment centres and theme
parks to ensure long-term growth.
  Chairman Tuanku Abdullah Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman says in the
latest annual report that the RM204.75 million from the proceeds of its
rights issue in November 1995 were used to expand its overseas business
and its existing operations.
  He says George Town has acquired a project in Leavesden, north-west of
London, which will house England's first movie theme studio tour and
family entertainment complex, comparable with that of Universal Studio,
Disneyland, and Disneyworld.
  Reviewing its financial standing, he notes that George Town has posted a
slightly higher group pre-tax profit of RM12.33 million for the year ended
March 31 1996 compared to RM12.19 million in 1995. This is on the back of
a turnover of RM310.20 million compared to RM310.11 million previously.
  Profit after-tax before minority interest improved slightly to RM8.02
million compared to RM7.92 million previously.
  Directors are recommending a final dividend of eight per cent less tax
for the year just ended.
  During the year under review, George Town Chemist Sdn Bhd opened two
oulets, one each in Kuala lumpur and Port Klang, bringing its total to 25
in the Klang Valley.

Notebook: An investor modest enough to admit making mistakes

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Yee Liam

THERE is this seasoned investor who told his friends that he had been
buying and selling stocks for over 30 years, experienced five major market
declines and yet he still makes the same mistakes.
  The only investor who does not make any mistake is a dead one and even
if he were to somehow return from the dead to invest in stocks, he is
likely to commit the same mistakes as before.
  The seasoned investor is modest enough to admit that he continues making
mistakes but as he is still rich and continues to speculate, he must be
making fewer of the same mistakes over the years. Otherwise, he is
unlikely to be rich today because if he had continued making the same
number of mistakes as he did in the early years of speculation in stocks,
chances are he would have lost most of his money by now.
  If he had gone through five major market downturns, it is logical that
he would have survived each of the downturns and participated in the
subsequent market rallies.
  He may have lost money because of the mistakes he made in each of the
boom and bust market cycles but as he is still wealthy today, his personal
scoreboard suggests that his right decisions outweigh his wrong decisions
in the stock market. The net effect of his decisions is that his profits
over the years have more than offset the losses incurred.
  Only an ignorant investor will strive for a perfect score and hope to
see profits in all his trades and suffer no losses.
  The most dangerous experience that a new investor can undergo when he
first ventures into the market is that of striking it big and making a lot
of money in his initial trades. He will think that making money is so easy
in the stock market, failing to realise that losing it could be even
easier if he becomes careless and over-expose himself. A new investor is
commonly in a hurry to make big money and consequently endangers himself
by taking on too much risk.
  A wise man knows his own limitations and accepts these limitations
gracefully and this seasoned investor is certainly wise because he readily
admits to his friends his limitations as an investor - one of which is
that he continues to make mistakes in stocks.
  He will still be making mistakes because he is only human and there is
no way he can avoid them completely as long as he is subject to the same
emotions and impulses which all human beings have.
  The only difference is that a successful investor makes fewer mistakes
than a less successful one, but they are likely to continue to make
mistakes.
  An experienced investor is likely to make fewer mistakes than the newer
one because he would have learnt from his past mistakes and make repeated
attempts to avoid them.
  Still, despite being more alert in avoiding mistakes, the experienced
investor will occasionally make some mistakes but he would have taken
precaution to make sure than he is not fatally injured financially and
that he will recover to fight another day in the market.
  After so many years of involvement in stocks, he will be realistic
enough to accept the fact that mistakes are unavoidable in stocks.
  More often than not, it is the new and inexperienced investor who goes
around with the notion that they must not make mistakes if they are to be
successful in stocks. He feels that many of those who came before him lost
money or if they did make money, they should be making more money, because
they made mistakes in their trading.
  As far as this new punter is concerned, he is out to "prove" that he
will be better than many of them because he will not make the same
mistakes committed by many others before him.
  He may not have realised it at this early stage but he had just made his
first mistake by carrying in his head the erroneous idea that he will not
make mistakes in the market. Over time he will realise how wrong he was.
  Ironically, by accepting the simple fact that making mistakes is part
and parcel of the whole business of speculation, the punter is better
prepared mentally to avoid the mistakes that come in our way.
  The reason is simple. If a speculator buys a stock because he feels that
the price will double in two months' time, he will not hesitate to get rid
of it if it does not perform to his expectations after one month. For
instance, if the price falls sharply instead of rising, he may quickly re-
examine the stock and come round to the conclusion that he had been
mistaken about the stock. He accepts that he can make mistakes and before
any further damage is done, he may decide to cut loss and clear out of the
stock.
  A punter who carries the notion that he will not make mistakes may not
be psychologically prepared to accept mistakes even if he is uncertain of
a stock anymore.
  Instead of acting fast and cutting losses if a trade has gone wrong and
he had obviously made a mistake, he may just refuse to budge and continue
hoping that things will get better.
  He has already made up his mind that mistakes will cause him to lose
money and as he does not want to lose money, he will not make mistakes and
by refusing to sell to cut losses, he can continue with the fiction that
he has not made a mistake. It tends to become a vicious cycle and it can
be costly to the punter when the vicious cycle is finally broken by him
selling out to cut his losses.
  There is this thing about realising one's losses and if a punter has to
ultimately realise his loss, it is better than he realise it sooner rather
than later because that way, he minimises his loss. Inaction and refusal
to accept reality can be enemies of the successful punter.
  If the punter cannot avoiding mistakes because stocks can be so volatile
and unpredictable, then he can at least minimise the damage that can be
caused when he makes the inevitable mistakes.

Ariston to compensate land occupants in Sihanoukville project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH, Sun: Ariston Sdn Bhd has agreed to pay some US$400,000 (US$1 =
RM2.51) in compensation to 360 families who are occupying land on the site
of the Kang Keng airport and on Naga Island, in Sihanoukville.
  "We are paying the compensation on behalf of the Royal Government of
Cambodia, eventhough land is a state matter," Mr Tan Teng Chye, Ariston's
project director, said in Sihanoukville.
  Ariston, which was awarded the US$1.3 billion Sihanoukville development
project, was accused of dragging its feet in starting work on the project,
by several quarters, including Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh.
  The Malaysian company explained that it was unable to begin renovation
work at the Sihanoukville International Airport - the first phase of the
project - as it was unable to obtain vacant possesion of the land.
  The amount that was paid to the various families is said to vary
according to the size of land each family lived or worked on.
  According to Tan, Ariston was advised on the amounts to be paid to the
villagers by a special task force within the Sihanoukville Development
Authority that was set up to determine the figure.
  According to the villagers and some of the provincial officials, the
cheques reportedly ranged from US$25 to more than US$3,000.
  However, Tan said Ariston has still not obtained vacant posession of the
land as the villagers are still on the land. "They should move off soon
and then we should be able to get things going," he told Business Times in
a telephone interview.
  Ariston has begun work on Naga Island, however, where an international
standard casino resort and hotel will be built.
  The deputy governor, Kim Bo, who witnessed the handing over ceremony,
said the villagers had arrived at a mutual understanding with the Royal
Government and were happy to accept the compensation.
  "I am aware that my land is located on a development site and I am happy
with the compensation," a villager was quoted as saying in a local
newspaper.
  He admitted that he was among those who had taken up weapons and
demonstrated at the airport site in May this year.
  "I thought that my land was being invaded by Ariston at the time and so
I took an axe to fight against them. But now I find they are honourable
and I am very happy with the compensation," he said.
  Neither Tan nor Cambodian officials would specify the amount of cash
that had been paid for each plot of land.
  However, Cambodian officials say the agreed compensation that was paid
by Ariston amounted to some US$1,500 for each hectare of land, though
other sources say US$1,700 was paid per hectare of land.
  Meanwhile, Ariston signed three agreements in mid-September with the
Royal Goverment that will expedite work on the Sihanoukville project.
  The first agreement was for the lease of land on Naga Island for a 70-
year period. Naga will be the site of an international standard hotel
resort and casino.
  The second was a land lease agreement for O Cheou Teal, involving the
development of an 18-hole international golf course and international
hotel.
  The third agreement was a 25-year build, operate and transfer (BOT)
concession agreement for the Sihanoukville International Airport.

Off market: Giving local analysts prominence

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

By Datuk Salleh Majid

A CHIEF executive of a stockbroking company told me how difficult it was
for him to get an appointment from an old friend. This friend happens to
be one of the key executives of a big and still expanding outfit listed on
the stock exchange with operations so diverse from the original core that
it is difficult to keep track. One day this chief executive thought, why
not look up this old friend and since his background is research, he
thought it might be a good idea to know what is happening with the
company. Instead, he was surprised to be greeted with a barrage of
questions, cynical enough to question his motive of seeking an
appointment. He said to himself that he is not going to ever call this old
friend for an appointment again. He felt if it has been any of the foreign
analysts such as Merril Lynch, Solomon or BZW, in no time will they be
granted an appointment. He is wondering what is happening to our
executives? Don't they realise that by being reluctant to meet local
analysts they are placing the local analyst in a more disadvantaged
position than the foreign ones?
  Not too long ago the Research Institute of Investment Analyst Malaysia
(RIIAM) conducted `Meet the Analysts' sessions for listed companies.
Although we had some response from some listed companies, but overall it
was difficult to get anybody to face the local analysts. In the end the
sessions were stopped for lack of response. At the same time we read about
companies with their entourage going overseas to meet the foreign analysts
or accommodating requests of foreign analysts. Maybe local analysts do not
represent billions or trillions of dollars foreign ones do, but disclosure
of information to our local investors will certainly help improve the
current situation of believing in rumours, so typical of the Malaysian
market. Take the second board companies for example, the whole euphoria
has the semblance of the 1993 bull run and prices are really getting to
dizzy heights. The amount of rumour being generated is unbelievable so
much so those so familiar with the characteristics of our investors need
only to generate some ridiculous rumour to get their support.
  This year the focus has certainly been on the second board but the
gullibility of the investors have certainly not been confined to just the
second board companies. The dialogue with local analysts was intended to
help enhance the transparency of companies. With the rapid pace of
economic growth it is not strange to find the rapid change in a company's
situation. The number of companies listed too increase rapidly and one
hardly has time to differentiate the numerous acronyms companies assume.
If companies are reluctant to entertain requests made by local individual
analysts, then the dialogue with a number of analysts might save a lot of
time and be more beneficial for the local investors. One cannot really
pass a law to stop rumour mongering. Neither can one pass a law to believe
in a rumour. If a rumour is being worked upon very hard by certain
individual to make it look like it is not a rumour (the prices actually go
up as claimed), it is even more difficult to convince the public not to
believe in rumours. So much has been said about the importance of relying
on fundamentals but this year anyone can throw fundamentals away by
showing the increase in the prices of second board companies.
  So much has been said of the importance of not relying on rumours about
the importance of investing in fundamentals but this year what seems to
drive the market is the same thing that drove the market in 93 and 94. The
volume of trade may be inflated by those who trade intraday, purely on
speculation. Do we limit the increase narrower? Do we limit the increase
on the first day of listing? Do we restrict the availability of
speculative trading? Do we restrict the flow of funds to the stockbroking
companies so that they cannot grant too many facilities to their clients?
Or do we shorten the settlement period so that there is not much room for
speculative activities? These are not easy questions to answer. We need to
balance between maintaining order and the need to allow the market to take
its course. If allowing to take its course means a lot of people are going
to get hurt, does it mean we will still allow it to happen?
  In the meantime, companies should come forward to be more transparent in
their activities and not necessarily wait for queries should there be any
irregularity. Periodic meetings with analysts will certainly enhance
investors' understanding of the corporate sector. Provided of course the
analysts do not keep the information to themselves.

Improved services with accountability

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

By Wendy Lim

THE corporatisation of the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of
Malaysia (Sirim) will be different from other such exercises undertaken by
the Government. This is because the role, contribution and viability of
Sirim will not be measured by its revenue-earning capacity.
  Sirim Bhd president and chief executive Dr Mohamed Ariffin Aton said its
corporatisation will allow a more flexible management system for it to
provide fast, efficient, cost-effective and customer-oriented services
with accountability.
  "Ultimately, we want to be cost effective and broaden our customer base
and train our people to make decisions at their level. This will certainly
speed things up but quality is maintained as they know their job well.
  "At the same time, everyone learns about responsibility and will be held
accountable for making that decision," he told Business Times in Shah
Alam.
  Ariffin was the managing director of Petronas Research Sdn Bhd before he
was appointed to head Sirim Bhd, taking over from Datuk Dr Ahmad Tajuddin
Ali who became the executive chairman of Tenaga Nasional Bhd,
  For Sirim to achieve quality and speed, Ariffin is embarking on an
"inside out" quality services strategy to meet its vision.
  He believes that quality, when planted internally, will progress
naturally outwards.
  "In our day-to-day work, for example, the finance department which holds
the traditionally role of scrutinising every claim will have to think of
its colleagues as clients.
  "Some think this will encourage forgery but the claimants have a
responsibility and are accountable for their claims.
  "In this way, there will be continuous improvement and value creation
for the company to move faster. Ultimately, Sirim is the people," Ariffin
said.
  Sirim's vision, he said, is to be a renowned institution in three of its
core businesses: research, technology development, and standardisation.
  His said his task is to strenghten the competency base and put in place
the research and development (R and D) strategy.
  Sirim's technology competencies include industrial instrumentation and
electronics, industrial automation, automotive, measurements and
artificial intelligence systems.
  Ariffin said R and D does not necessarily get one's hands dirty. "There
is also a management side to it which I am dealing with."
  He feels that R and D is a continuing process of investment and regards
researchers as "a special breed of people who are very independent".
  "It is an intellectually challenging experience to be in the group," he
said.
  Ariffin, who considers working as his pastime and thinking of solutions
as his hobby, feels that the biggest challenge in managing researchers is
to change their perception of research work as a service.
  "Research is not a hobby, especially when there is a sponsor, and
researchers must try to provide the quality work in as short a time as
possible within a limited budget," he said.
  On human resource management, Ariffin said he is not worried that
Sirim's staff will be pinched. "All good companies will have staff
movement. Those who move away from Sirim are not totally lost as they will
be contributing to the country in other ways."

PM unhappy with UN Security Council"s failure to censure Israel

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 20

PRIME Minister Datuk Seri Mahathir Mohamad yesterday expressed
disappointment with the UN Security Council members for their failure to
censure the Israeli Government led by Mr Benjamin Netanyahu for breaching
the peace agreement between Palestine and Israel.
  "The Security Council members should have taken into account the various
violations committed by the Netanyahu Government such imposing blockades
on Palestine by preventing Palestinian aircraft to land on the Palestinian
airport, preventing Palestinians to commute to work, and building of
Israeli settlements," he told reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz
International Airport yesterday.
  "Members of the Security Council failed to accuse Israel of committing
these violations out of fear of being branded as pro-Palestine," Dr
Mahathir said.
  "That is why we had the (UN Security Council's) resolution calling for
the cessation of hostilities, closure of tunnel and resumption of peace
talks.
  "I am attracted to (British Foreign Secretary Malcolm) Rifkind's speech,
where he outlined one-by-one all the violations of treaty committed by
Israel since Netanyahu took office as Israeli Prime Minister."

Amcorp sees abundant opportunities for expansion

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 5

WITH the Malaysian economy heading for the ninth consecutive year of
strong growth, opportunities are abound for Arab-Malaysian Corp Bhd
(Amcorp) to further enhance its position as a leading provider of
financial, property and infrastructure services, says its chairman Tan Sri
Azman Hashim.
  In his latest annual statement, the chairman says the group will
"entrench our strategy on our financial and property/infrastructure
services expertise to create synergies these two core business areas and
at the same time, seek to develop our interests in other sectors such as
industrial services".
  Reviewing the group's performance, Azman says the group's core business
areas continued to record impressive growth.
  Amcorp's activities in property development have been given a boost when
it acquired about 82.96ha of land for the development of 311 bungalow lots
under the exclusive Kayang Heights development project, which is next to
the Bukit Cerakah Forest Reserve in Shah Alam.
  Amcorp has also successfully concluded conditional mandatory general
offers for shares in two companies. The first being the shares in
Melawangi Sdn Bhd, developer of the prestigious Amcorp Trade Centre in
Petaling Jaya, which is now 100 per cent-owned by Amcorp.
  The other is South Peninsular Industries Bhd, a manufacturing company
listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) second board, which is
presently a 51 per cent-owned subsidiary of the group.
  Azman says growth within AMMB Holdings Bhd, which led the financial
services sector of the group, continued to be significant. Among the
developments is the commencement of offshore banking operation in Labuan.
  Elsewhere, Arab-Malaysian Securities Holding Sdn Bhd expanded its
operations to Indonesia when it acquired a 60 per cent stake in Jakarta-
based stockbroking firm, now renamed PT Arab-Malaysian Capital Indonesia.
The group, through a subsidiary company, has also acquired a seat on The
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Ltd.
  Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank, which obtained Tier-1 status and the
approval from Bank Negara to open four more branches, has entered into an
asset management joint-venture agreement with Macquarie Bank Ltd of
Australia.
  Closer to home, AMMB Futures Sdn Bhd began operations trading in futures
contracts on the Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange and
the Malaysia Monetary Exchange. Meanwhile, Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd and
Arab-Malaysian Bank Bhd has also received approvals from the Central Bank
to open nine and eight new branches respectively.
  Azman says the growth prospect of the Malaysian economy is expected to
create increased loan demand which will provide lending opportunities for
the AMMB Holdings group. Likewise, activities in the capital markets will
remain robust, in line with Government's objective of promoting Kuala
Lumpur as a regional financial hub.
  "Thus, the group is poised to harness further opportunities arising in
the forthcoming year," says the chairman.
  Other significant events include the listing of Powertek Bhd, in which
Arab-Malaysian Development Bhd has a 30 per cent stake, on the main board
of the KLSE. Azman says this is notable as it is the first independent
power producer and first new infrastructure project company to be listed.
  For the year ended March 31 1996, the Amcorp group registered a profit
before tax of RM321.9 million, which shows a growth of 38.6 per cent.
Profits from Amcorp's own activities, comprising financial services and
property construction and development, surged by 79.3 per cent to RM87.7
million.

Marina Cove"s RM100m project

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 6

By Meera T'Ratnam

MALACCA-bound Marina Cove which will be built on a 35-acre coastal site at
the Kuala Linggi riverine estuary joins the latest string of waterfront
development projects to take off this  year.
  Construction for the RM100 million integrated waterfront property is set
for December this year. The project will be developed by Harvest Rimba
Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of public listed Harvest Court Industries Bhd.
  The development, which is projected to be completed by 1999 is situated
close to Port Dickson and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport in
Sepang.
  "We are very pleased and excited to be developing this project in
Malacca given the state's historical ties with the sea. With the
development of Marina Cove, we hope to generate local interest in yatching
and other related activities," director of Harvest Rimba Sdn Bhd, Encik
Abdul Halim Yunus said.
  "The main attractions of the cove lie in its low resident per acre
density, exclusive home designs and its own private marina berthing
facilities," he said, in a statement.
  "These factors, together with pleasant surroundings and world-class
marina facilities make it a high value investment."
  Marina Cove waterfront project, which was launched a few days ago by the
Chief Minister of Malacca Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Zin Abdul Ghani, will
comprise of bungalows, townhouses, apartments, shops, hotel apartments, a
clubhouse with marine facilities and a broadwalk.
  "Marina Cove will have the lowest resident density per acre in the
waterfront marina development segment. We will be developing only 12 units
per acre  compared to the industry average of 40 units per acre," said
Abdul Halim.
  "Because we want own ers and residents to enjoy the privacy and serenity
for their surroundings, we will be developing only 19.25 acres of the
alloted 35 acres of coastal land. The remaining acre is devoted to open
spaces and water ways," he said.
  On the developed area, a Marina Arcade comprising of 10 shoplots and a
16-storey Waterfront Apartel consisting of a 150 unit apartment hotel will
be built.
  On the residential side, Cove Apartments-made up of five different
blocks of either four or five storeys and only 176 apartments, will be
built. The company also plans to offer 80 units  of terraced townhouses
with private berthing facilities as part of its Waterfront Quay Terrace.
  "In other waterfront projects in Malaysia, private berthing facilities
are available only to bungalow owners. Marina Cove has extended this
exclusive facility to our terrace house owners because we want as many
residents as possible to enjoy the pleasure of yachting and boating," he
added.
  Some 20 bungalow lots are expected to be available to owners of
Waterfront Villas.

Malaysia an atrractive choice: Economist

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Meera T'Ratnam

WITH the outlook for both the Malaysian stock market and economy set to
improve considerably by year-end, Malaysia will be an attractive choice
for the astute investors wishing to bank in Asia, Jardine Fleming Pte's
Singapore-based economist Rajeev Malik says.
  Not only have fears of a fast-paced economy been allayed but purer
economic and political fundamentals, coupled with Malaysia's ease in
coping with this year's global electronics slowdown, are just some reasons
why Malaysia may win hands down in garnering economists' approval.
  "Until a few months ago investors were worried that Malaysian economy
was growing too rapidly. The economy was like a Kancil bounding with a
high centre of gravity," he said. "It raised fears it would topple coming
round the corner."
  "But it's made a very skillful turn, so much so the concern now in some
quarters is that softer external demand will cause a sharper-than-expected
slowdown," he said.
  In an interview with Business Times, Malik said some downward revision
of the government's own estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) growth -
previously set at 8.5 per cent - should be expected with the budget. The
budget is set to be tabled on October 25.
  Expectations of a sharp slowdown in GDP are quite unwarranted though, he
says. While the economy is moderating, its overall strength remains
robust. Malaysia's second quarter performance of 8.4 per cent was much
better than Singapore where half-year growth came in at a lower-than-
expected 7 per cent.
  Despite estimates that up to half of Malaysia's total exports are tied
up in electronics, the slowdown in electronics has hurt Malaysia far less
than other Asian tigers. The absence of lumpy imports has also contributed
to this year's trend of sharply falling trade figures, with exports
outpacing imports.
  "Malaysia's current account deficit for 1996 is already set to be much
lower than Thailand," he said. "Neither does it have to contend with a
hotbed of political and economic woes like Indonesia and Thailand."
  Malik expects real domestic demand to ease from 14.6 per cent to 10.1
per cent in 1996. He credits the central bank for steering the economy
without resorting to severe credit controls. Last year's budget brought
tighter controls on credit card users, higher taxes on real property gains
and foreign purchases of real estate, higher taxes on luxury cars and less
financing for car purchases.
  The central bank followed up with initiatives to free up interest rates
by introducing a new framework for calculating base lending rates; raising
the statutory reserves requirement twice; and, a healthy dose of moral
suasion.
  It may have taken some time for the slowdown to register but loan growth
has clearly eased. Though partly driven by a decline in lending to broad
property and consumption, Malik says it's happening across the board. "A
recent pick-up in property lending growth in no way bucks this trend," he
adds.
  On the longer-term horizon, Malik dispelled the need to agonise over the
loss of competitiveness issue hounding the coverage of Asian economies
lately. "Sure, the convergence theory that Asia is cheap is no more. But
it does not mean because costs are rising, foreign investors are shifting
their investments and moving out."
  On trend in Malaysia, a greater proportion of new investment in
manufacturing goes towards expanding existing operations, instead of
setting up new ventures but as Malik sees it, "It's part of a gradual
process that has to take place for Malaysia to become the capital of
value-added manufacturing operations".

"Shorties" to debut on KLSE today

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jennifer Jacobs

TODAY, for the first time, the Malaysian stock market opens itself to
"shorties", the colloquialism for those who carry out short-selling, that
is "... selling shares one does not own in anticipation of buying them
back later at a lower price and profiting from the difference in price."
  Many foreign players, as well as professional traders, have long
commented that opening the market to short-selling is a crucial step in
the development of the Malaysian capital market as it will facilitate
hedging and arbitrage activities which are essential for the introduction
of stock options trading.
  What this roughly means is that one can either buy equities and short-
sell futures, thereby covering one's back if the market turns either
bullish or bearish or short-sell equities and buy futures contracts.
  With the introduction of short-selling, investors can also profit in a
bearish market.
  Short-selling is expected to increase the liquidity of the market
especially for the securities in the approved list. The list of 50
counters, released on Friday evening, came as a surprise to many who had
only expected some 20 to 30 counters initially to be on it.
  As at the end of last year, only 28 counters had met the relevant
criteria for short-selling, namely, an average daily market capitalisation
of RM2 billion for the past three months; at least 100 million shares in
public float; at least 2,000 registered shareholders; five years of
uninterrupted profit track record; and, an average monthly share volume of
more than 2 million for the past 12 months.
  These criteria had been drawn up to ensure that short-selling is not
allowed across the board but limited only to the "bluest of blue-chips".
  Of course, the Securities Commission, in approving the rules drawn up by
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), had added that the exchange has
the discretion to expand and change the list of approved securities as and
when deemed necessary.
  The exchange must have deemed it necessary right away because the list
included companies that are hardly blue, maybe a pale azure.
  The question, of course, is whether in "shorting the shares" investors
can actually manipulate the prices and push them down unnaturally, as it
is one thing to bet on the shares going down and another altogether in
forcing the counter down.
  The exchange, with this concern in mind, has introduced prescribed
limits to bring about an idealised form of short-selling.
  KLSE senior manager for marketing development S. Loganathan said the
exchange will suspend further short-selling for any period if the position
exceeds the amount that is desirable to public interest or if it is
detrimental to the counter.
  Every deal has to be reported to the KLSE at the end of the trading day
so that the exchange can disseminate the positions of the short-selling
done for the day.
  Direct deals are not allowed, meaning no off-market deals between the
dealer and the client.
  And only stockbroking companies which have in place approved written
guidelines on "Know Your Customers" practices will be permitted to engage
in regulated short-selling.
  Investors seeking to engage in regulated short-selling must be fully
aware of the risk and have the financial capacity to meet their financial
commitments. Which basically means as in all other types of trading: "If
you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen."
  Professional traders used to the liberality of the more matured markets
may find these safeguards rather draconian and unnecessary, but they
should bear in mind the highly speculative image of the KLSE, especially
the second board, where speculators have had a field day in pushing up
stocks as the fancy takes them.
  The exchange, which has been trying to fight off this image, would be
loath to put yet another toy into the hands of these gamblers.
  However, all in all, short-selling is essential for the maturity of the
capital market and regulated short-selling protects the market from
possible foul play, so maybe this will be one market that can have its
cake and eat it.

Resolve problems within party, advises Dr M

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

By Jimmy Yeow

PRIME Minister and Barisan Nasional chairman Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir
Mohamad has urged members from the Barisan component parties not to go to
court to solve their internal disputes.
  He said while it is common to have differences in opinions between
members, they should try to resolve their problems within the party.
  Dr Mahathir said there will be no end to the culture of members seeking
legal action if members persist in doing so.
  "Today it will at the party's central committee level, tomorrow
divisional and branches."
  For example, he said even if a member succeeds in getting the court to
declare him or her as the party leader, it would not help if the majority
of the members reject his or her leadership.
  "There must be some form of compromise within the party.
  "If this cannot be achieved, the dispute should then be solved by the
political way of who is getting the most support from members," he told
reporters at the Sultan Abdul Aziz International Airport on his return
from New York yesterday.
  He was asked to comment on the political tussle between Parti Gerakan
president Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik and Gerakan member and member of
Parliament for Batu, Datuk Joseph Chong.
  Dr Mahathir said the dispute within Gerakan will not affect the Barisan
coalition and expressed confidence that the Gerakan members will be able
to resolve their problem among themselves.
  On Umno, Dr Mahathir said the special committee, headed by him, to
investigate complaints against disciplinary committee members for
allegedly breaching the no-campaign ruling is keeping an eye on the
conduct of the candidates.
  "You will find out in time," he said to a question whether any of the
disciplinary committee member had breached the ruling.
  A total of 185 candidates has been declared eligible to contest in the
Umno party elections in October.
  On allegations that some candidates are using their official functions
as a  "platform to campaign" by opening two or three functions a day, the
Prime Minister said the bunching of some of these functions could not
avoided.
  "But I hope the delegates will be able to judge for themselves the
motives of these functions," Dr Mahathir said.

Act now to ensure sufficient supply (HL)

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 1

THE construction industry's strong run may falter if measures are not
taken to ensure sufficient supply of basic building materials, according
to findings of a study prepared for the Ministry of Domestic Trade and
Consumer Affairs.
  At least six basic materials critical to the industry are likely to be
short in supply before the year 2000.
  Clinker, the main component for making cement, is also on this list.
Supplies of marble, reinforcement steel, structural steel, and PVC pipes
are also not expected to be able to meet the industry's demand. The supply
of sanitary ware and fittings are expected to begin running short by 1999.
  Even materials which are expected to be in surplus could experience
"localised" shortages.
  The study investigated supply and demand trends of 15 building materials
since 1994 and produced a trend forecast up to the year 2000.
  Expansion plans, existing production capacities, imports and exports
were also analysed in studying future trends for the building materials.
  The study was conducted by Arthur Andersen HRM (Management Services) Sdn
Bhd in association with the Quantity Surveyor Malaysia. It is the first
report prepared for the Goverment which covers the aspect of basic
building materials.
  The 15 materials included in the report are cement, carpentry and
joinery timber, aggregates and crusher-run, marble tiles, ceramic tiles,
bricks, reinforcement steel, structural steel, sand, roofing materials,
uPVC pipes, cast iron pipes, concrete pipes, sanitary wares and fittings
and timber of formwork (plywood and timber remnants).
  The construction sector is forecast to grow at an average rate of 7.5
per cent a year.
  Clinker is likely to be short in supply up to the end of the year. Even
at 90 per cent production capacity, local manufaturers are only expected
to churn out 9.9 million tonnes of clinker this year. Domestic demand
however is forecast to be 10.7 million tonnes.
  Clinker is a major semi-finished product used in the production of
cement. Production of a tonne of cement requires a 0.95 tonne input of
clinker.
  Last year, local clinker production was only 7.7 million tonnes which
was only about 83.7 per cent of the required 9.9 million tonnes, thus
causing a supply deficit of 2.2 million tonnes.
  Local cement producers will continue to source clinker from South Korea,
Japan, Thailand and Indonesia until the shortage, which has been occuring
since 1991, begin to ease later next year, the report said.
  The study forecasts a 1,000 tonne surplus of clinker next year.
  The situation will further improve in 1998 with a surplus of 3.2 million
tonnes but dropped to 2.9 million tonnes in 1999 and 2.1 million tonnes in
the year 2000.
  The cement industry, as a whole, is involved in a production expansion
programme from 13 million tonnes in 1995 to 21.87 million tonnes by the
year 2000. The Malaysian Cement Industry's 1995 Report showed that the
demand for cement last year was 12.1 million for Peninsular Malaysia and
1.35 million tonnes for Sabah and Sarawak.
  In the case of marble wall and floor tiles, the report said that with
its current production at 52 per cent capacity, shortages can be expected
right up to the year 2000 and beyond. However, the shortage may be delayed
at least until 1999 if production runs at full capacity. The report
suggested that the authorities look at the possibility of imports to meet
the rising demand.
  For reinforcement steel, the report forecast a shortage of 29,000 tonnes
next year which will reach 430,000 tonnes, or more than a quarter of the
total demand, in 2000.
  In the case of structural steel, the shortage since 1994 is expected to
last until the end of the decade despite increases in production capacity.
The authorities have been urged to introduce new incentives to attract new
investments to the sector.
  Demand for sanitary ware and fittings grew between 1988 and 1993 but
supply has been able to meet the industry demand. At 85 per cent
production capacity, the industry is expected to face a shortage by the
year 1999.
  The uPVC pipes are substitutes for cast iron and concrete pipes and are
mainly imported. Since the early 1980s, local production capacity has not
been able to meet the requirements of the local market. This is not
expected to change during the period under review.
  The study also highlighted manpower shortages in the respective
industries producing the building materials. Inefficient transport
services, quality of materials, and pricing were also discussed.

Smooth start for self-service at selected Caltex petrol stations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

SELF-service for motorists at Caltex Oil petrol stations seems set to have
a smooth introduction with the company offering self-serve educational
programmes for motorists at three sites.
  The three selected petrol stations, located in the Klang Valley, have
been positioned with a group of trained experts known as customer service
assistants to help motorists get comfortable with the idea of serving
themselves.
  "We are committed towards addressing the labour issues that are plaguing
the country, especially with the issue of foreign labour at the
forecourts," chairman and managing director of Caltex Oil (M) Ltd, Mr.
Robert J. Gregory said in Kuala Lumpur.
  "As with any change, there is bound to be some apprehension and we
believe the best solution is to help, prepare and educate the public to
get used to the various aspects of self-service," he said.
  The Meor Hisham station in Ampang began to offer self-service on
September 19, followed by F I Star and Kwang Hap Siang.
  The company has put in place a programme that incorporates various on-
site programmes for motorists. This is to familiarise them with the
concept of self-serve well before the Government mandated date for all
petrol stations to be on self-service by January 1, 1997.
  Trained customer service assistants will point out how to use user
friendly electronic facilities and to guide customers on payment methods
according to their choice of cash or card.
  In addition, Caltex Malaysia will also have an elite squad of trained
personnal who will be deployed to these self-serve test stations initially
and subsequently to the various self-serve test stations in residential
neighbourhoods.
  Tagged as the "Self service Support Squad" (SSS Squad), the squad will
be commissioned to provide additional support to customer service
personnel at petrol stations and introduce the do-it-yourself concept
whilst giving hands-on demonstrations on self-serve.
  Apart from investing in mobile labour squads, Caltex has also invested a
total of RM9 million on hardware, electronic and retail automation for
facilitating self-serve.
  Caltex has also set up a toll-free hotline at 800-3188 to handle
enquiries on self-serve.
  "We are confident that with our comprehensive programme, additional
features and unique services, Caltex Malaysia will take the lead for self-
serve," said Gregory. "We will also be joining the Government and other
oil industry members in the joint educational programmes that have been
planned." he added.

Ecodrill scores a first with oil well workover service

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 2

By Kang Siew Li

IN THE past, Malaysia had to depend on foreign-based workover service
contractors to put non-productive oil wells back into business, but
Ecodrill (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd has changed all that.
  In the middle of last year, the company purchased its own workover rig
for RM15 million and, in doing so, became the first Malaysian company to
provide full workover service.
  The rig, named "Merpati Cerah", was designed and partly built by
Ecodrill and is capable of "working over" or reconditioning 30-40 oil
wells a year and drilling up to 10,000ft, Ecodrill director Raj Narayanan
said in an interview with Business Times.
  "Unlike other rigs used in the oil and gas industry, this rig is easy to
dismantle and is designed to handle all heavy duty workover work except
pure drilling," he said.
  He believes the improved design will help the company's clients save
substantial amounts of money in conducting remedial operations to restore
production at problem wells.
  The company was awarded a major workover service contract worth RM11
million a year by a leading oil and gas company - Unocal Thailand, which
is a subsidiary of US-based Unocal Corp.
  "The initial contract period is for one-and-a-half years, but the deal
is expected to take between four and six years," Narayanan said.
Operations are expected to start in the middle of next month.
  The contract is viewed as a means to help Ecodrill realise its long-term
objective of becoming a regional integrated workover service company, he
said. The company is also negotiating similar deals with three other oil
companies in Brunei and Indonesia.
  "This, coupled with our approval as a local contracting arm under the
Vendor Development Programme of Petronas, should see the company operating
at least four workover rigs (inclusive of the existing one) by the year
1999," Narayanan said.
  Ecodrill hopes to have its subsequent rigs totally manufactured in
Malaysia.
  Besides workover services, the company is also actively involved in
providing technical training services.
  "We have successfully established a skills training centre in Miri,
Sarawak, known as Ecotech Training Centre and Technical Institute since
1990," Narayanan said.
  Established in 1988, Ecodrill is jointly owned by Narayanan (16 per
cent) and chairman Mej. (R) Mat Salleh Noor (84 per cent). "The initial
paid-up capital of the venture was RM25,000, which has since increased to
RM3 million."
  Narayanan said the company with 32 workers was set up to provide
consultancy services to the oil and gas industry in Malaysia and the Far
East region in the drilling, engineering, production and maintenance
areas.
  "Four years later, we started providing technical training in petroleum
and drilling engineering at the present Technical Institute," he added.
  "Miri was chosen because we saw tremendous potential growth in the area
at the time. We also wanted to go to an area where we felt we could
introduce certificate and diploma courses to people interested in the oil
and gas industry," he said.
  Plans are already under way to set up its first branch campus in Kuala
Lumpur next year.
  "We also intend to upgrade the Technical Institute to become a research
and development support centre, now that we have direct involvement in oil
production operations, as we own a workover rig," Narayanan said.
  "From there, we can move to the development of new products and
technologies," he added.
  Narayanan believes Ecodrill is now ready to export its services
regionally, particularly to Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam.
  Currently, Ecodrill's business totals some RM4 million a year which is
solely from the provision of training and consultancy services.
  "This year, we expect total business to increase to RM6 million from
training and consultancy services together with a small contribution
coming from workover services," Narayanan said.
  From next year onwards, with the Unocal Thailand contract in hand and
improvements at the Technical Institute, the company expects turnover to
reach RM18 million to RM20 million a year.
  "By 1999, we'll see turnover rising to RM60 million-RM70 million a
year," he said. "Workover services will eventually contribute 70 per cent
of total revenue while the remaining 30 per cent will be from training and
consultancy," he added.
  Narayanan estimated that in Malaysia, the workover business is worth
RM100 million a year. "We are not looking at monopolising the industry,
but we aim to secure between RM20 million and RM30 million worth of
services."

YOUTH and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Mohd Yassin says Automobile
Association of Malaysia (AAM) chairman Tunku Mudzaffar Tunku Mustapha has
written to him requesting that they meet with local motorsport officials
over alleged infighting and disputes within the affiliates. Speaking in
Subang yesterday after opening the national level "Jati Diri Budaya Belia"
programme, he said he will listen to their viewpoints and get an objective
picture of the situation. While Malaysia plans to host a Formula One event
in 1999, the Malaysian rounds of the Formula Asia series have been
cancelled and the International Automobile Federation has struck the Rally
of Malaysia off the Asia Pacific Championships Round next year.

MAH to "represent all hotel views"

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 3

By Kang Siew Li

MALAYSIA Association of Hotels (MAH) president Mazli Mohamed wants the
211-member body to be truly representative of the entire sector by getting
most, if not all, the nation's hoteliers to join MAH.
  "I don't want the association to be perceived as one that only looks
after the welfare of hotels in Kuala Lumpur just because it is based in
the capital," he told Business Times in Kuala Lumpur.
  Mazli who is also Holiday Inn (hotel operations/development) general
manager, has taken the first step by ensuring the association represents
the views of hotels across the board.
  "Our new management committee members comprise not only four- and five-
star hotels but also three-star operations as well," said Mazli, who has
taken over from Encik Azman Harun whose two-year term ended recently.
  Mazli wants the association to be more vocal in fighting for the
interests of hotels and the industry. MAH is currently seeking to lower
electricity charges which have gone up with the withdrawal of the 10 per
cent discount on electricity tariffs for the hotel sector.
  He said the hotel industry contributes substantially to the country's
total electricity consumption and that the average three- or four-star
hotel (with 200 to 300 rooms) in Kuala Lumpur spends about RM500,000 per
year on electricity.
  Tenaga Nasional Bhd is very aware of this and it has already raised
electricity charges considerably without giving prior notice, he said.
  The association has submitted a memorandum to Energy, Telecommunications
and Posts Minister Datuk Leo Moggie in June to consider its claims but has
yet to receive a response.
  MAH, working together with the Government, is also looking into
ambiguities in sewerage and service charges, the Social Security
Organisation (Socso), the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and wages.
  "We have compiled these matters in a memorandum which has already been
sent to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar
Ibrahim during a pre-budget dialogue session in Ipoh in July," he added.
  Mazli said the hotel industry is presently enjoying a boom, with hotel
occupancy rates at between 70 and 80 per cent.
  "At the end of next year, we'll see tremendous growth in hotels in the
country as the industry gears up to host the Commonwealth Games for the
first time," he explained.
  At present, there are about 55,000 hotel rooms in the country.
  The number is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of next year.
  On whether the hotel market will be saturated then, he says, this
largely "depends on how well we promote our country and how good our
economy will be".
  "Equally important is the location of a hotel. If a hotel is not
properly located, it may suffer with the onset of fierce competition," he
added.
  However, Mazli said one unavoidable problem is the shortage of skilled
workers and service staff.
  "This will inevitably lead to an uncontrolled increase in wages as
hotels fight for more staff to fill positions in their hotels. Each
(hotel) tends to offer more for similar posts," he explained.
  Because the market share for hotels is becoming smaller, Mazli said
hoteliers must now work hand in hand with the authorities to find ways and
means to bring in more visitors into the country.
  "I think we should not rely solely on the Government to bring in more
visitors. I believe hotels have got to do more," he said.
  He added that the association has been supporting the Government in all
its efforts to promote tourism in the country.
  Mazli said MAH is currently working with the Malaysian Association of
Tour and Travel Agents and the Malaysia Tourism Promotion Board in
anticipation of the Asean Tourism Forum which will be held in Kuala Lumpur
in January next year.
  "The event will generate income and create more awareness of Malaysia's
tourism industry," he believes.
  "At the same time, the association is also looking at the meetings,
incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sector.
  "This is one component of the tourism business that I think will
contribute major exchange earnings to the country in the long run," he
said, adding that business travellers have higher disposable incomes and
their length of stay is longer.
  Mazli said there is a need to build convention centres in Kuala Lumpur,
Penang and Kuantan so that business will be spread out evenly.
  According to him, the construction of the Kuala Lumpur International
Airport (KLIA) in Sepang marks the beginning of a new era, as "the new
airport means more airlines will be coming in, more visitors and more
business for the hotel industry".
                               

Pix: Mazli ... tremendous growth in hotels in the country.

Ordinary week but for 2nd board plunge

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Roziana Hamsawi

IT WOULD have been a rather uninteresting week if not for the "sad
incident" which befell  a majority of the second board stocks on Thursday,
leaving punters to shift their attention to cheaper main board stocks.
  Otherwise, the local bourse last week was mildly active on quite a
healthy number of shares traded, making it "generally uninteresting but
definitely not boring" according to one analyst.
  Despite the country's seven months' good trade figures, the market had
started out on a weak note last week, arising from the uncertainties in
the direction of US interest rates. The KLSE Composite Index, on Monday,
lost 4.09 points, closing at 1,126.51 while the second board index rose
1.35 points up to 608.48.
  On Wednesday, shares rose in active trade with strong gains registered
in index-linked stocks. It was an immediate reaction to the US Federal
Open Market Committee's decision to maintain interest rates at the current
level. The Composite Index closed 5.59 points higher at 1,129.31, while
the second board rose 16.62 points to 625.41.
  After a continuous upward movement in the second board index, Thursday
saw it tumble down 24.86 points or 3.98 per cent to 600.55. Although a
correction was expected, the fall on Thursday was due to concerns of
restrictions on second board stocks, imposed by some local stockbroking
firms. The KLCI, however remained steady, losing only half a point to
1,128.81.
  The last day of the week ended fairly mixed with the CI moving up 1.78
points at 1,130.59 while the second board index continued its downward
fall, breaching the 600-psychological level to end the week at 595.58. The
first time the second board index hit the 600 level was the Friday before
when it closed at 607.13.
  Overall last week, a total of some 1.647 billion shares were traded
worth RM14.258 billion compared to 1.781 billion shares worth RM15.006
billion the week before.
  About 914.247 million shares were traded on the main board valued at
RM6.681 billion, while the second board saw a total of 602.420 million
shares done worth RM7.114 billion.
  Analysts said for this week, the market is expected to move sideways,
with speculative main board stocks continuing to attract punters. Interest
in second board stocks, however will not cease, said one analyst.

Chart trend: Bourse set to be choppy with wide fluctuations

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 11

By Raymond

ACTIVITY on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) started on Monday with
blue-chips taking a back seat while play resumed among speculative stocks
on the second board.
  Negative trade figures which were reported did not have a significant
impact on the KLSE.
  Volatile trading on Tuesday saw second board stocks trading in an
erratic fashion.
  Stocks on the main board were not doing much either, one way or the
other.
  Heavy speculative buying on Wednesday pushed prices of small capital
stocks upwards.
  The overall market sentiment also improved with a new batch of stocks
which came into play.
  The volatile movement of second board stocks continued on Thursday, only
this time round, they were hammered by aggressive selling.
  The bearish situation was, however, cushioned by firm support for
selective main board stocks which registered good gains.
  Mixed trading was the order of the day on Friday. Market sentiment was
pulled down by cautious selling on second board stocks, while only the
situational issues on the main board were giving supportive play in the
market.
  For the week, second board stocks were again in the limelight for the
right and wrong reasons.
  The much expected correction came in to cool off the over speculation
which has taken the second board stocks to record highs.
  Market players who were caught on the high side would be licking their
wounds, but for medium- term investors, this correction is healthy.
  Sentiment wise, the KLSE is expected to be choppy with wild fluctuations
to remain a feature among second board stocks.
  The market minus the very speculative second board stocks is still
attractive in value terms and interest may just shift to main baord
counters.
  In the past couple of weeks, there has been a slow uptrend which has not
caught too much attention among main board counters.
  This gradual momentum has not produced anything spectacular but with
patience there is a high potential for lagging stocks to bring in the
rewards.
  On the technical front our short-term Timing Device has been on the
downtrend for the past eight trading sessions and currently the falling
pace has been steadily reduced in the past four sessions.
  It is quite possible that this short-term market barometer which is now
standing at -56.4 points, is preparing itself for a trend reversal
sometime this week.
  The first supporting level is at -119.2 points, failing which, it is
expected to have the second support at around the -300 point level.
  Our O/O Indicator has continued to go up but at a lesser pace.
  Until this rising market barometer is arrested, we will continue to
remain bullish and treat corrections such as the one we are now seeing as
a technical pullback, which are necessary for any rally in the market.
  Currently, breaking out of the overhead resistance at zero is vital to
the continuation of the bullish trend we are seeing.
  Failure to do so can lead to our market heading for a new serious
correction.BT O/O INDICATOR

The Kunta Kinte column: Maintain good name of country abroad

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Datuk A. Kadir Jasin in New York

NEW YORK: A prominent Malaysian businessman I met strolling on New York's
Fifth Avenue a couple of mornings ago excitedly told me that his managing
director was in the Bahamas to attend the wedding reception of his nephew.
  He told me the story after I remarked that the Malays have come very far
from their rice farming days to be able to stay in the best hotels, shop
at the most fashionable stores and stroll leisurely on one of the most
fashionable streets of one of the largest cities in the world.
  And he was not alone and he may not have travelled on the supersonic
Concorde as some did. A whole group of Malaysia's most successful
businessmen descended on the city last week to join the Prime Minister,
Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, at the United Nations.
  The fact that an untypically large group of Malaysian businessmen had
accompanied Dr Mahathir to the UN is explained by the fact that the Prime
Minister had earlier attended and addressed a business meeting organised
by the Asia Society.
  They could have joined the trip in deference to the Prime Minister and
the co-sponsor of the Asia Society dinner, Petronas.
  Having covered major international conferences around the world in which
Malaysian leaders have participated since the late 1970s - first for the
Business Times, then for Berita Harian and now the New Straits Times - I
can quite confidently say that our country has come a long way.
  In the late 1970s and early 1980s, only a handful of business people
would accompany the Prime Minister or his deputy on such trips. The
Bumiputera businessmen were the rarest.
  The Prime Minister or his deputy could count themselves lucky if they
had more than the usual group of journalists from Radio and Television
Malaysia, Bernama and the few large newspapers accompanying them.
  Businessmen almost invariably did not consider accompanying the Prime
Minister on international trips a fruitful business. Officials, too, did
not find it appropriate to invite them to join him on his official tours.
  Malaysia Incorporated was still many years away and the likes of Tan Sri
Tajudin Ramli, Tan Sri Halim Saad and Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Hussain were
still in the backrooms learning the tricks of the trade.
  Even dealmakers Tan Sri Vincent Tan, Datuk Francis Yeoh and the youthful
Datuk T.K. Lim were still in the background - shadowed by the likes of Tan
Sri Lim Goh Tong, Mr Robert Kuok and Datuk Tan Chin Nam.
  Tan Sri Kishu Jethanand of Globe Silk Store fame had already hit the big
time but had yet to develop an international profile, while Mr K. Ananda
Krishnan had the name but not the face. He had made his fortune in oil
and, being a graduate of Harvard University, was at ease with things
American.
  He is still a shy and highly private person. But like other successful
Malaysian businessmen, he too has been thrust onto the world stage by
Malaysia's unprecedented economic success in the last decade and by Dr
Matathir's Malaysia Incorported policy.
  In the early days, the media organisations were invited to send
journalists to cover the Prime Minister's visit abroad and their expenses
were often borne by the Government. This practice was stopped by the late
Tun Hussein Onn when he became Prime Minister in 1976.
  Fortunately, since media organisations also benefit from the rapid
economic growth, they can continue to send journalists on overseas
assigments at their own expense.
  When I was first sent to New York for assignment, the best hotel the
Business Times could offer was The Tudor, which in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, charged US$70 a day (US$1 = RM2.51). Today, even middle-level
journalists stay at St Regis together with the Prime Minister.
  Times have certainly changed. But the bigger change is in the way the
Government and businesses are collaborating to strengthen the country's
position on the global political and economic map.
  For this very important reason, it is contemptible that we find some
Malaysian companies and businessmen showing tendencies of becoming
arrogant and insincere in their dealings with the outside world,
especially the poorer countries.
  I think it is the collective responsibility and moral obligation of
Malaysian businessmen, especially those enjoying the privilege of being
included in the Prime Minister's entourage, not to do things that will
tarnish the good name of the country and its leaders.
  It is alright for them to take pride in telling people that they are
accompanying the Prime Minister or his deputy, especially if it helps to
open doors. But they must make sure that they announce the Prime
Minister's name at the appropriate door.
  Those who misbehave, even in front of a United Nations security guard or
a hotel clerk, should be hauled up and spoken to by those responsible for
including them in the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Kurang ajar and arrogance should not be made our trademark. If they are
not known to have good manners (including table manners), they should be
given proper briefings before they are let loose on the world as members
of the Prime Minister's entourage.
  Although some Malaysians can travel all the way from Kuala Lumpur to the
Bahamas to attend wedding receptions and their children's graduation or
are picked up in a private jet to go on a gambling trip to Las Vegas, we
should avoid behaving like kaduk naik junjung. We should try to be like
padi, semakin berisi semakin tunduk.

Prices end lower on US rates fear

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 12

SINGAPORE blue-chip stocks closed last week 0.8 per cent lower on Friday
amid an absence of local and overseas incentives after fears of a US
interest-rate rise were disproved.
  The Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) ended the week 16.81 points
down at 2,171.05. The broader All-Singapore index was 2.35 points lower to
529.17.
  Dealers said the market was expected to trade in a narrow range in the
near term, but added that the start of October could see some programmed
buying by institutional investors.
  Average daily turnover fell to 68.79 million shares worth S$187.46
million.
  The week opened on a quiet note with investors trying to digest the
release of lower-than-expected August trade data and awaiting the Federal
Reserve's decision on interest rates.
  Creative was still the top gainer, its share price recording an absolute
increase for the week of S$1.95 to S$7.95.

Stocks rise as US rate jitters ease

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 13

SHARE prices rose 1.4 per cent over the week to Friday as the futures
market gained after the US federal reserve left interest rates untouched
mid-week, dealers said.
  The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong's key Hang Seng Index gained 167.03
points last week to finish at 11,759.39 on Friday.
  Average daily turnover amounted to HK$6.2 billion, down from the
previous week's HK$7.158 billion dollars.
  The market rose on blue-chip buys, up 29.77 points last Monday. It lost
75.43 points on Tuesday on rate jitters but recovered 0.5 per cent on
Wednesday and a further 32.60 points on Thursday.
  Friday saw the biggest gain of the week with the Hang Seng up 123.26
points.

Mart ends mixed on FOMC move

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Public Bank Treasury Division

THE market's immediate reaction was mixed as to the surprise move by the
Fed to leave rates unchanged at the September 24 FOMC meeting. The Fed's
action gave the market a clearer direction for interest rates as the
week's economic data turned out mildly weak.
  Consumer confidence for September was down to 111.8 against August's
112.0 and August's existing homes was also down 0.02 million to 4.13
million. More significant was the durable goods for August which dropped
3.1 per cent against a 1.4 per cent increase the previous month.
  With this, rates eventually eased and they are expected to stay soft
next week until the next FOMC meeting in November.

Rates expected to close firmer this week

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank Bumiputra Treasury Division

INTERBANK money rates closed firmer as players borrowed the short- to
medium-term money for the settlement of the new bonds to be issued today.
  Shorter-end money rates rose higher while the longer-end closed steady
as covering activities were mostly centered on the short to medium tenors.
The highlight of the week was the tender result of the new bonds issue
which was announced on Friday afternoon.
  The 7-year MGS 2/96 coupon, fixed at 6.586 per cent, rallied after the
result to a high of RM100.60 as short covering activities took place. It
settled at RM100.33/35 in active trading.
  Even though the market was still flush with excess liquidity, term money
rates were pushed up in anticipation of a tighter market next week as
there will be an outflow of RM2.0 billion being payment for the new bonds
issue.
  The benchmark one, three and six months closed higher at 7.25/30 per
cent, 7.30/35 per cent and 7.33/35 per cent respectively.
  While one, two and three weeks money closed above 7.00 per cent as
dealers did not want to be caught short next week.
  The new MGS 2/96 bonds showed a big jump as the yield was depressed to
as low as 6.48 per cent after the announcement compared to 6.60/58 per
cent when it was traded in the grey market. It however retraced to close
the week at a 6.53 per cent yield (price RM100.33/35).
  There was no Bank Negara bills issue during the week forcing some banks
who were short on their liquid assets requirement to buy up Bank Negara
bills in the secondary market.
  As a result the band 4 (68 to 91 days) Bank Negara Bills dropped to
6.65/63 per cent at closing compared to the last tender result average
which was at 6.728 per cent.
  For this week, we expect rates to tighten temporarily due to the payment
of the RM2.0 billion for the new bonds.

Money talk: Investors surprised by Fed decision

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 14

By Bank of America Treasury Division

EARLIER last week, speculation of whether the US Federal Reserve will
increase interest rates during the FOMC meeting had preoccupied the
foreign exchange market.
  However, the market was caught by surprise with the Fed's decision to
leave interest rates unchanged, prompting fresh concerns about rising
inflation. The FOMC voted against raising short-term rates, even though a
majority of analysts had predicted a modest 25 basis points increase.
  Currency investors that had banked on a rate increase sold the US dollar
from 1.5140 to 1.50  marks, with strong support seen intact at 1.4980.
Some dealers blamed politics for delaying a much-needed interest rate
increase, with the pressure of Presidential and Congressional elections in
November.
  By the end of the week, the market witnessed a steady bid interest on
the US dollar after a surprising Swiss interest rate cut. Switzerland cut
its discount rate to an 18-year low of 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent and
investors fled the Swiss franc and the mark . Investors appear to have
forgotten their dissapointment with the Fed's decision to keep interest
rates untouched. The market is also expecting lower interest rates in
Germany in the coming months. The market has also turned a blind eye to
the dissolution of the Japanese Parliament's Lower House.  The market
closed at 1.5240 amd 110.70 against the mark and the yen respectively.
  As for next week, the market is vulnerable to all US indicators in the
run-up to the key non-farm payroll on Friday. Some analysts believe that
the US asset markets are currently hyper-sensitive to all kinds of rates
and so the US dollar could be on its guard. Others express concern that
the US dollar is gaining its strength mainly from external factors. The US
dollar will require fresh internal incentives/factors to rise above its
current key resistance level of 1.5250 marks.
  As for the local unit, the ringgit fell to the 2.51 level on fresh US
dollar demand ahead of the month-end requirements from commercials and
also due to heavy stop losses orders being triggered as the market
approaches the 2.51 level. The market is expected to be traded between
2.5050 and  2.5125 for next week.
  As for the Asian currencies, we expect the Singapore dollar/ringgit  to
trade between the 1.7750 and 1.7880 range and  the yen/ringgit between
2.2500 to 2.2800.

assumed on our part for error of facts and opinions.)

Hope for a city struggling for survival

from BUSINESS TIMES, The New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad,
     30 Sep 1996, page 4

By Leela Barrock in Phnom Penh

PHNOM PENH: There was a loud sound. The car dipped and then appeared to
levitate. A harsh gasp broke the startled silence as the passengers
waited, almost expectantly, in the split second for the bang ... There was
a dull thud and then the silence was broken by an apologetic giggle.
  "Sorry, pothole," the driver said. A regular journey through the streets
of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
  This is a city of contradictions. The traveller first meets what must be
a collection of the nicest Customs officers in the world, as they
apologise for having to check your luggage and then actually help you to
put your things back.
  Having been lulled into a false sense of security that all the
literature on the gentle Cambodian people is true, the weary traveller
sets foot outside Pochentong International Airport, only to be accosted by
a large crowd of deafeningly aggressive taxi drivers. They stick their
faces in yours and holler at the top of their voices: "Taxi, madam".
  If it is not the taxi drivers, then it is self-styled porters who try to
grab your bags and rush off in any direction they think you want to go.
Saying "No" is of no help.
  After locating your vehicle, they will shove everything into the boot
without a thought given to the fact that you may be blanching in shock at
the sound of breaking bottles of sambal belachan and Lee Kum Kee oyster
sauce. The inevitable tip is asked for. You could get away with a 500 riel
tip (about 50 sen) although if you do not have riels, US$1 (2,500 riels)
will get you a princely bow.
  Once safely in the car, the next shock hits you: there are no street
lights in most parts of Phnom Penh. This adds a new dimension to the
meaning of the phrase "pitch dark".
  Then, comes contradiction number two in the glaring and almost
decadently bright shape and form of Monivong Boulevard, one of the main
streets in the city.
  Almost every shop is adorned with colourful lights, and neon signs blink
away the darkness announcing the presence of massage parlours, snooker
parlours and parlours where one can do any number of parlour-like things.
This is the world of Suzie Wong - on a smaller scale and without the
American GIs.
  In the glaring daylight, however, Monivong is a lot less colourful. It
is shrouded in a perpetual cloud of dust that seems to hang over the whole
country and choke and cloak everything. The facades of the shops and
stores without the cover of night, are no more inviting than the "rumah
tumpangan" in Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur.
  A quick whizz around Phnom Penh, and this city-bred Malaysian had parted
with a fortune in US dollars to what appeared to be society's downtrodden.
Beggars come at you from all sides and do not mind pinching conveniently
exposed parts of your body to attract attention. Most of them are
heartrendingly incapacitated, lacking in at least one limb, usually more.
  These are just a small part of the thousands of mine victims in
Cambodia, struggling to make a living in a country where even the fit,
hale and hearty have a tough time making ends meet. The only other two
places in the world where I have seen these many beggars are India and the
London underground.
  By lunchtime, several dollars poorer, wearing a cloak of dust and
parched from the dry heat of the city's "rainy season", we stepped into a
"Pizza Hot" restaurant. The logo is a mirror of the more well-known Pizza
Hut's red and white. The food is not that much different - a tad more
international than the Malaysianised fare in Kuala Lumpur's Pizza Huts.
  Suddenly overcome by a fit of homesickness, I decided to find that
accoutrement of most homesick Malaysians - Maggi Mee. Choosing the fastest
means of transport, I hopped on to a "moto dop" (motorcycle which doubles
as a taxi) and whizzed away, past the slower "cyclos" (trishaws).
  Whizzing with me were whole families of five or six, perched on
motorcycles. There were also the odd motorcycle balancing a mattress or
two, or with furniture strapped high on the back seat. I ogled at them and
the Cambodians ogled back at me, for I was the only woman sitting astride
a motorcycle, hanging on for dear life to the rider.
  The other women all sit side-saddle and do not come into any physical
contact with the riders. During the war years, apparently men too were
required by law to sit side-saddle on motorcycles because this made hand-
grenade throwing more difficult.
  In a local supermarket catering for expatriates, I found Maggi Mee. It
was also here that I encountered Cambodian directness.
  "Madam come from where?" a sales assistant asked me.
  "Malaysia."
  "Madam how old?"
  Looking as mortified as I felt, I decided to pander to this peculiar
outrightness. "Madam, 29 years old."
  "Ah ... " (She looked surprised). "I think Madam sirty fife," she said,
driving the point home by holding her hands up to show three and five
fingers.
  I left the store bemused and amused, armed with a packet of curry laksa
flavoured Maggi Mee which cost 25 US cents. Also in my grocery bag was a
packet of cigarettes which cost US$1, a bottle of Angkor beer for 80 US
cents and a French loaf for 30 US cents.
  Grabbing a newspaper for 1,000 riels, I walked out of the store to read
the first person account of a Khmer Rouge deserter on life with the
notorious Pol Pot leader of the guerrilla faction, which had stayed in
power in the country from 1975 to 1979.
  Almost 20 years after the Khmer Rouge were overthrown, their legacy
remains in the broken families, the shattered dreams of the people, their
crushed city, the homeless children, the bomb craters dotting the
countryside, and ruined lives.
  That night, after a packet of Maggi Mee and sitting in the balmy night
breeze of my villa (read this as semi-detached house), I noticed the smell
of Phnom Penh was finally overpowered by the large "mata kucing" tree in
my front garden.
  Phnom Penh smells like a growing child - of food, sweat and hope.
  And it is this hope that is most infectious. I found myself hoping that
the Khmer Rouge will surrender and that complete peace will be restored to
this still tragic country, that those of my generation who have known not
much more than a life of war and deprivation will be the last to know such
a life.
  The gentle smiles from the older generation of Cambodians are no longer
mirrored in the younger folks. It is this gentleness that could be the
biggest loss if hardship and constant economic struggle become the way of
life.

Fed seen raising rate by -1/4-point

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Leon Hadar in Washington

But some expect rate rise only after presidential polls

THE consensus among Fed watchers is that policymakers at the US central bank
will decide when they meet tomorrow to raise the federal fund rate, now 5.25
per cent, by a quarter point.

If this happens, it would be the first increase in 19 months.

Economic data issued on Thursday that showed stronger-than-expected housing
starts and shrinking claims on jobless benefits bolstered arguments that the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would boost interest rates to keep the
economy from overheating.

Some experts, however, think the Fed may refrain from raising rates during a
presidential election campaign. They think the FOMC may instead decide on a
half-point rate hike at its next meeting, which will be after the November
poll.

Those who expect an immediate increase in the federal fund rate, which is what
banks charge each other for overnight funds, note that a majority of the 12
Federal Reserve district banks are now reportedly in favour of a quarter-point
hike.

There are signs that some of the inflation doves in the Fed, including
Governor Janet Yellin, are now concerned about the growing signs of inflation
and support a tighter monetary policy.

The FOMC consists of the six governors of the Federal Reserve and the 12
regional bank presidents.

Wall Street has been perplexed by the mixed messages in recent days about the
economy, with stock and bond prices falling at signs of inflation (and a
possible rate hike) and then rising as threats of inflation (and a rate
increase) seemed to dissipate.

Lowest take-up for new homes in eastern S'pore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low and Agnes Wee

Leasehold status, prices said to be among reasons for highest proportion of
unsold units

[SINGAPORE] The Geylang and East Coast areas have the highest proportion of
unsold new apartments, a BT survey shows.

And for new houses, the lowest take-up rates are in the Kew Drive area in
Bedok. BT looked at private housing projects of at least 50 units now under
construction and which are not yet fully sold. Data was divided into
sub-regions according to postal districts.

Geylang has the highest percentage -42 per cent -of unsold new apartments.
Next comes the East Coast (28 per cent).

In contrast, only 2 per cent of new apartments are still unsold in Pasir Ris.
In the Orchard/Bukit Timah area, 12 per cent are unsold, and in Upper Bukit
Timah, 13 per cent.

Market watchers offered several reasons for the varying take-up rates.

Geylang, for instance, was only recently turned into a residential corridor
with a series of new launches last year, and still suffers somewhat from its
reputation as Singapore's red-light district.

But location and pedigree are not the only reasons why people buy property.

The East Coast is a well-established residential district and yet 28 per cent
of the 2,949 newly-marketed apartments there have not found buyers.

Said one consultant: "The East Coast already has a high concentration of
freehold private housing estates and the new ones are mostly leasehold, which
may be less popular."

Also, prices of new leasehold East Coast projects are typically a shade higher
than equivalent freehold Upper Bukit Timah properties.

The Bukit Timah stretch (districts 11, 21 and 23) has seen a flurry of new
launches over the past year, and these projects generally saw strong take-up.
About 400 new units are still on the market.

But supply in this sector is growing -1,300 new condominium units being built
by Far East and City Developments in Bukit Batok (district 23) have just come
on the market.

In landed properties, projects in familiar landed territory (like Serangoon)
fared well, while those in new areas (like Kew Drive and Jurong West) sold
slowly.

In the East Coast area, more than half of the houses in three Kew Drive
projects have not been sold. Consultants say, though, that buyers' resistance
to these 99-year lease houses, launched last year, is slowly wearing down.

Far East still has 18 of its 31 Kew Gate units and 20 of 37 Kew Residencia
houses to sell. Nearby, CityDev has yet to sell 46 of its 76 Villas at Kew
units.

In district 22 (Jurong West), United Overseas Land still has 98 houses up for
sale in Westwood Park after phase one (170 units) was launched about a year
ago.

In the prime Holland Road area, a third of Far East's 113 Holland Grove
(99-year lease) are unsold.

The biggest developer, Far East, has not yet sold 27 per cent of its new
houses and 29 per cent of its apartment or condo units unsold.

Far East is by far the biggest supplier to Singapore's private housing market,
marketing thousands of new units every year. Recent projects which are now
fully sold include the Kew Vale houses and Westcove condos. Another big-league
developer, CityDev, has 21 per cent of its condos and 60 per cent of its new
houses still unsold. Earlier this year, the Kwek-controlled company sold out
its 928-unit Signature Park.

DBS Land, meanwhile, still has 30 per cent of its condos on the market. It has
sold out Casuarina Cove in Tanjong Rhu and the 159-unit Richmond Park near
Orchard Road.

Chavalit, Amnuay ahead in race for new Thai PM

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Markets likely to be cautious until outlook becomes clearer

THE Thai government's six coalition partners are in intense behind-the-scene
manoeuvring following Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa's resignation and
ahead of a meeting tomorrow.

Mr Banharn's Chart Thai Party, with 92 seats in parliament, remains the core
of the coalition and its Members of Parliament have indicated they want a say
in who becomes the next premier.

Mr Banharn, who is being blamed for Thailand's economic slowdown, has said the
next prime minister must be competent in economic affairs.

The two front-runners are Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration
Party, and Amnuay Virawan who heads the Nam Thai Party. Both men are deputy
prime ministers in the current cabinet.

Dr Amnuay, formerly a respected bureaucrat, finds more favour with the
business community. He was executive chairman of Thailand's largest bank,
Bangkok Bank, from 1983-1992.

While Dr Amnuay might be preferred by the business community, his Nam Thai
Party has only 18 seats in parliament and this would make it difficult for him
to govern.

General Chavalit, a former army chief who quit to join politics, has been
bolstering his political base with the just-announced military reshuffle. He
has been promoting big commercial projects, like a new bank, for the military.

Mr Banharn announced on Saturday he would resign in seven days' time. But it
is not clear if Mr Banharn will take any position in the new cabinet.

His departure will be greeted with relief by the business and financial
community, but the financial markets are likely to be cautious until the
political outlook becomes clearer in the next few days.

Photipong Lamsam, chairman of the Board of Trade, said the new cabinet should
be formed quickly because the prolonged political problems have affected
business.

Mr Banharn's hand was forced on Saturday morning when New Aspiration Party,
Nam Thai Party and Muanchon Party banded together and threatened to vote
against him on the no-confidence motion if he did not agree to quit before the
vote.

During the blistering three-day censure debate, Mr Banharn was accused by the
opposition of economic mismanagement and corruption.

An upset Mr Banharn, whose 14 months as prime minister has been stormy, said:
"I have been very tired after working for slightly over one year. I am proud
of what my government has done so far."

Thailand's exports have slumped this year and economic growth is at its lowest
in a decade. Speculation is rife that the Thai baht will be devalued to
stimulate exports, and the currency has been under attack with Thai stocks
sinking to three-year lows.

Top Asian groups to join US$200m Yangon project / Wharf Holdings, Jardine
Matheson Holdings, Salim Group, Pidemco Land,

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Loh Hui Yin in Bangkok

Jardine, Salim and Wharf to take stakes in industrial project promoted by
S'pore

THREE of Asia's biggest conglomerates are joining a Singapore-promoted US$200
million (S$280 million) industrial development project in Myanmar.

They are Wharf Holdings and Jardine Matheson Holdings of Hongkong; and the
Salim group of Indonesia.

Singapore's Pidemco Land will also become a shareholder of Sinmardev
International which is promoting the project.

Sinmardev International's original shareholders are architect-businessman
Albert Hong and his firm, RSP Architects, Planners and Engineers, and building
materials producer PD International of Singapore.

The project calls for the development of a 12 square kilometre industrial park
and a port for bulk cargo on the outskirts of Yangon. It is a much scaled-down
proposal from the ambitious $4 billion township that Sinmardev mapped out two
years ago.

The Myanmar government, which has a 40 per cent stake in the project, will
provide land in Thanlyin-Kyauktan, about 18 km south-east of Yangon. The bulk
terminal will be located in Thilawa where another Singapore firm, C&P
Holdings, has been given permission to build and operate container berths.
Thilawa is 16km inland from the Yangon river.

Having the three big business groups, which are likely to be minor
shareholders, will help Sinmardev market the project to potential investors.

A Singapore businessman active in Myanmar said the three big groups are most
likely using the Sinmardev project as a testing ground for future investments.
He added that Singapore-backed projects are held in good esteem by the Myanmar
authorities.

Singapore's Pidemco is not new to Myanmar as it is building a hotel there. The
Port of Singapore Authority is also exploring an investment in a Thai-backed
township project in Yangon.

Ex-head of derivatives trading at Barings to sue

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann

LONDON

He claims FT, authors of new book have defamed him

RON BAKER, former head of derivatives trading at Barings, is suing the
Financial Times and authors of a new book on the collapse of the bank.

Mr Baker has featured in alleged transcripts of taped telephone conversations
at Barings. They were obtained by FT reporters John Gapper and Nicholas Denton
and have been published in the newspaper's serialisation of their book, All
That Glitters.

Mr Baker, who was in charge of Nick Leeson when the rogue trader brought down
the bank, has been trying to clear his name for some time. He contends that
the serialisation and book to be published today have defamed him by quoting
conversations out of context.

Moreover, he claimed the FT has prejudiced a forthcoming hearing before the
Securities and Futures Authority. Several months ago, Mr Baker sought a
hearing before an SFA tribunal to defend himself and reverse a proposed
three-year ban and [pound]10,000 (S$22,000) fine.

"The implication of what is said in the Financial Times is that I somehow
contributed to the collapse of the bank and this is untrue," Mr Baker told BT.
"The cause of the collapse was a fraud in the segregated client accounts of
Barings' agency broking business; it had nothing to do with house trading
which I ran in 1994."

Mr Baker added that he became head of the derivatives desk at the beginning of
January 1995, less than two months before the bank collapsed.

"Nothing in the SFA allegation against me relates to the collapse of Barings,"
Mr Baker said. He added that by the time he was made Leeson's manager, the
trader's fraud was well advanced and Barings' losses ran into millions of
pounds.

"The publishing of taped telephone conversations in its own right does not
bother me, although they are a dangerous medium for establishing the facts
upon which to draw conclusions," Mr Baker said. "Isolated telephone
conversations do not provide the full story (my telephone wasn't taped) and
they give no context."

"However, in this case, they have cut and pasted a number of different
conversations, omitting large areas, in a manner which creates a picture
totally at odds with the facts."

The FT will be defending the case because it believes that the book has strong
evidence.

All set for invasion of Normandy / Microsoft Corporation

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

Microsoft plans landing of its first Internet platform in the Asia-Pacific

[SINGAPORE] Microsoft is planning to invade the Internet of entire nations in
the Asia-Pacific with Normandy, its Internet platform with capabilities in
Internet commerce and the Intranet.

Normandy is Microsoft's first platform for commercial Internet services
specifically designed for Internet service providers (ISPs), network operators
and Internet content providers. It has several servers including Merchant
Server, Microsoft's Internet commerce server that allows customers to set up
Internet malls; tools to build Intranets; and security features for Internet
commerce.

"The Internet war is not over browsers because both companies (Microsoft and
Netscape) are giving away browsers (free). The war is over Internet servers.
It is the servers that makes money for these companies," said Ray Chang, chief
executive officer of AsiaConnect, Malaysia's largest provider of Internet
sites. AsiaConnect is Asean's first Normandy user.

Analysts predict that Intranets will generate many times more revenue than the
Internet. Mr Chang said Normandy would be one of the platforms for a broad
bandwidth Intranet consisting of fibre optic cables and microwave networks
that will cover the whole of Malaysia in two years.

Though Netscape now dominates the Internet server market, Mr Chang predicted:
"A fairly large portion of Malaysian Web sites will use Normandy. Normandy
will command a substantial market share worldwide rapidly."

He said this is because the money Microsoft is putting into research and
marketing, running into billions of dollars and exceeding Netscape's turnover,
is "mind-blowing".

Chinese organisations, Indosat (Indonesia's only international
telecommunications company), NTT (Japan's national telecommunications
carrier), Datamat (a Thai ISP), Singnet and Singapore Cablevision are
evaluating Normandy. Analysts believe NTT will take up to half of Japan's
Internet market in future.

SAP, one of the world's largest software firms, will integrate its enterprise
software with Merchant Server.

However, Mr Chang qualified: "I would not write off Netscape."

He noted the high quality of Netscape's Applications Foundry, a suite of
Intranet tools. AsiaConnect deploys both Netscape's servers and Normandy.

Ben Yeo, a deputy manager with Sembawang Media, pointed out that Normandy
works only with Microsoft NT. This means organisations running Unix servers
cannot use Normandy for their Internet applications. Mr Yeo said that as long
as Unix remains, Normandy cannot totally replace Netscape. Sembawang Media is
a Netscape distributor.

However, Microsoft network manager Chong Yoke Sim said: "With Normandy, it
will accelerate the adoption of NT, not only for corporations, but also ISPs."

Netscape regional manager Casey Ong said Normandy is not so open. He
explained: "Merchant Server works closely with ActiveX, which makes Windows an
indispensable component in the Internet. That rules out Internet appliances
which do not use Windows, and future versions of Windows will include Explorer
(Microsoft's Internet browser).

"Microsoft, in trying to promote Explorer, will make it such that there are
certain sites that Netscape Navigator cannot get into. The only access to
non-Microsoft databases like Oracle is through ODBC, which is not conducive to
massive exchange of information or mission-critical applications."

Ms Chong said future versions of eshop, an Internet commerce technology now
incorporated into Merchant Server, will be compatible with NT only, whereas in
the past eshop worked with Unix software and Silicon Graphics hardware.

Netscape's Mr Ong pointed out that computers not using Windows or NT, users
with Netscape browsers, and millions of future Internet appliances like
handphones and TV will not access Normandy easily. And AsiaConnect's Mr Chang
said Sun hardware cannot work with Normandy.

"For Internet commerce to take off at full speed, we need to embrace open
systems. Even if Netscape doesn't do well, there are third parties to build
applications, based on open standards," he said.

Internet malls are coming your way

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] It's been great to send and receive e-mail. It's been mind-blowing
to surf the ever-expanding world of the Internet. And soon, Singaporeans will
have a new cyber treat -- they will be able to shop at Internet malls.

These "malls" allow users to virtually inspect goods, shop, order goods, bank
and conduct financial transactions via the Internet.

Contact, a subsidiary of the Sembawang Group, and AsiaOne, a subsidiary of
Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), will set up the Internet malls early next
year. Both companies will set up infrastructure for the malls and from there,
their customers can set up as many shopping "precincts" as they want.

The concept is part of the Electronic Commerce Hotbed, a National Computer
Board initiative.

Contact general manager Gary Koh said last week: "We will have customers
running their malls by early next year. Some people have committed
themselves."

He declined to reveal who these Internet shopkeepers will be, but said most of
the organisations which expressed interest in the cyberspace malls are local
banks and local merchants. He added that Contact would have regional customers
setting up Internet malls soon.

There has been similar enthusiasm, too, for AsiaOne's Internet mall scheme.
Low Huan Ping, general manager of AsiaOne, said local parties had committed
themselves to setting up shop. It will also, in future, have stores from the
region.

Contact's parent company, Sembawang Media, offers a service whereby customers
can put their Internet malls on Sembawang's Asia Internet Holdings (AIH)
backbone.

Similarly, AsiaOne will be putting its Internet mall on Cyberway's own
pan-Asian backbone, which Cyberway is building with regional Internet service
providers. SPH is a majority owner of Cyberway.

HP cautious over home PC push into Asia-Pacific market / Hewlett-Packard

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Jennifer Lien in Palo Alto

BusinessIT

Company V-P tells why it's better to be safe than sorry

US-BASED computer giant Hewlett-Packard is taking a cautious approach in
bringing its home PC product, the Pavilion, to the Asia-Pacific market, a
senior official said.

"Just because it's been successful in the US, it doesn't mean it will be
successful elsewhere," said vice-president Duane Zitzner, who heads HP's
worldwide personal information products group.

"We have to be very careful to balance that business with our return on
investment," he said.

He gave several reasons why the home PC space is difficult to compete in -poor
margins ("They're terrible. Sometimes they even go the other direction") and
the existence of "garage shops" or clone-makers which sell PCs at cut-throat
prices.

The product's launch in Asia has also been slowed by some "supply-chain
difficulties", director of South-east Asian sales and distribution Philip Chua
told a press conference in Singapore earlier this month.

Despite these difficulties, the home PC market is important for HP as a
springboard for HP's entry into other emerging home technologies, such as a
"home server" which manages household appliances and information -a product
about "a year away" from being launched, estimated Asia-Pacific marketing
manager Steve Haslett. Mr Zitzner said: "Being in the home market gives us
knowledge and understanding of the consumer and where that business might go."

HP also already has several other non-PC products in the home space, including
printers and calculators.

After a successful 1995 pre-Christmas launch in the US, HP decided to launch
the product in Europe and test the Asia-Pacific market, starting with
Australia and New Zealand. The countries were chosen for their similarity to
the US, said Mr Zitzner. Launched in April, the Pavilion has quickly moved to
become one of the top seven home PCs in those markets.

"We need to make sure the business model works well -supply chains, sales and
distribution model, retail channels. As we become more sophisticated with
that, then we'll look at expanding the market," said Mr Zitzner.

Singapore could see the launch of the Pavilion as early as the second quarter
of next year, according to Mr Chua.

Features customers can look forward to, based on HP's new October models,
include Pentium microprocessors of between 120 and 166 MhZ, 3D accelerated
video graphics, an 8X CD-ROM drive, pipeline burst cache and up to 2.5 GB hard
drive.

The products will also have a suite of imaging features as well as built-in
Internet access.

Eutech sets global sights with software consortium / Eutech Cybernetics

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Annette Pau

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Home-grown Eutech Cybernetics has initiated an Asia-wide virtual
corporation that it hopes will vault the high-tech company into the ranks of
global IT players.

Hari Gunasingham, scientist-turned-entrepreneur and managing director of
Eutech Cybernetics, told BusinessIT in an interview: "We want to be the
standard for enterprise systems, the Windows 95 of the enterprise game."

Eutech Cybernetics is the main driving force in the formation of the
Eutech-Asia Software Consortium, which currently comprises six member
companies, including five publicly-listed Indian software companies. It hopes
to add other IT companies over time.

Eutech-Asia is a software consortium which aims to deliver IT products and
services aligned with business systems through an architectural model to set
new standards in the fast growing area of enterprise computing.

The consortium will be officially launched tomorrow, based on a Memorandum of
Understanding signed early this year. Members include Eutech Cybernetics,
Microland, Infosys Technologies, Macmet India, Ashok Leyland Information
Technologies, BFL Software.

"Today, the whole paradigm is about enterprise systems. People are
increasingly looking at corporate networks and systems, and as more corporate
Intranets are connected up, they will want new ways of doing business, new
business systems, new concepts. These are the areas that we as a consortium
want to tackle," Dr Gunasingham said.

Consortium director Arun Abraham explained how the consortium helps pool
resources: "Eutech provides the systems knowledge, management and marketing
infrastructure in Singapore, while our Indian counterparts have the technical
skills and expertise, and the human resource."

One of the central aims of the consortium is to create an architectural
standard for both IT and business systems. Eutech has in fact developed an
architecture as a framework for building enterprise systems and for delivering
both products and services to businesses. This, says Dr Gunasingham, is both
userand network-centric, allowing business objects to communicate with each
other using "intelligent agents".

It also seeks to join forces in R&D, focusing on wireless communications and
agent-based technology. Collective R&D spending so far has amounted to some
$15 million.

According to Dr Gunasingham, response to the consortium has been good. Many
regional companies have asked to join the consortium, and it intends to take
in more members to increase their pool of IT professionals to a lofty number
of 100,000 in the year 2000.

"We expect to grow faster than the current 70 per cent average growth of the
(Indian) members of the consortium," said Dr Gunasingham.

Eutech Cybernetics was founded in 1990, a spin-off from research scientists
from the local university. Staff has grown from five to 140 now.

Eutech's revenues for FY95 were some $11 million. In FY96, Dr Gunasingham
reckons modest revenues of $16 million. This is expected to double the
following year, with the launch of Catseye, described as the embodiment of
Eutech architecture.

Canon Singapore sales surge with whopping printer demand / Canon Singapore

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Sales by Canon Singapore, which oversees the electronics
manufacturer's operations in Asia outside Japan, grew almost three times more
than projected, thanks to strong demand for its printers.

Canon Singapore last week posted a 35 per cent increase in sales to US$493.3
million (S$690 million) in the first half of this financial year from US$366.4
million in the same period last year. The steady growth of the office
automation industry and the introduction of a new range of printers are
believed to have contributed to this.

Actual sales have far surpassed the projected growth of 13 per cent, the
group's managing director, Mr Kohtaro Miyagi, said. "It is certainly a boost
for the group's operations, especially in the emerging Indian and Indo-China
markets," he added.

Sales of printers accounted for most of the increase in sales, with a 118 per
cent jump in demand for Laser Beam printers. Bubble Jet printers also
registered a 20 per cent increase, with brisk sales of low-cost-high-output
models such as the BJC-610 and the BJC-210.

Calculators also sold well, with a 56 per cent growth in sales due to an
expanded range of products. Sales of facsimile machines and cameras increased
by 9 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively.

Parent company Canon Inc also did well, recording a 89.2 per cent increase in
consolidated net income in the first half, compared with a 20.7 per cent rise
in net sales in the same period last year. Canon Singapore's results were the
foremost contributor to this increase. Projected consolidated net income and
net sales for Canon Inc this year are US$727 million and US$22.7 billion
respectively.

Hopes of Windows NT surge overstated : Analyst

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Kenneth James

BusinessIT

But Smith Barney's Bosak still sees 18 to 20 per cent PC growth

[SINGAPORE] For months analysts have been predicting that the launch of
Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 operating system will light a fire under the
personal computer industry.

Won't happen, says Smith Barney Inc's computer research chief Barry Bosak.

But Mr Bosak, managing director of the New York securities major's research
division, adds that PC growth should still hit a respectable 18-20 per cent
this year. "Business isn't bad," the veteran analyst says. "Demand, especially
corporate demand, is steady."

Mr Bosak, a former head of the Computer Industry Analysts group in the US,
tracks computer and related stocks for Smith Barney, the second-largest
securities firm in the US. Speaking to BusinessIT last week, he gave his
perspective of the state of the industry.

The softening in the PC and related industries is because "too much electronic
capacity has been put on line", he says. Part of the reason has been the
doubleor triple-ordering of components and peripherals by PC makers, and
resultant cancellations.

Add to that an overhang of PC supply from last year. He cites a finding by
research group Dataquest that as much as six million PCs were made in excess
of demand last year. That will have to be cleared this Christmas quarter.
Still, he doesn't expect a repeat of last year's December quarter which was
characterised by "whimsical purchases by consumers who had a lot of money".

But demand in both corporate and consumer markets is healthy, Mr Bosak
emphasises. Only don't expect last week's launch of Windows NT 4.0 to spark
off a resurgence in PC sales. That's "overstating the case" and there will be
"no big wave" of NT-induced buying, he says. "I don't think corporations are
running out to buy Pentium and Pentium Pro PCs."

He explains that corporations are "more methodical" in their computer
purchases now. And they have had plenty of time to build up their PC armoury
in anticipation of a switch to Windows 95 and Windows NT.

He cites the case of a large financial institution that has been buying
Pentiums and Pentium Pros steadily since March. "It's not something that's
happening all at once."

So who are the likely winners and losers among computer stocks? For a start,
Mr Bosak zeroes in on a largely unheralded group: data storage providers.

He offers this insight on the changing nature of computing: "I don't think
computing is about computing, it's about information, either getting it or
sending it."

So storage companies will be engines of the new information age. Which is why
countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, which succeeded in attracting
the major players, "are going to feel very fortunate".

His pick of the winners in this category: EMC Corp in high-end disk arrays;
Seagate, IBM and Western Digital in disk drives.

Among PC companies, he is upbeat about beleaguered Apple Computer. "They are
doing the right things to shore up the company, and they have some exciting
machines coming out," he says. Apple rates a "buy, with speculative risk" in
his book. But leader Compaq is an "underperform, high risk" stock: "High
margins gone; near term bounce over," he says.

In networking, "Cisco is doing a phenomenal job" while Sun "has a lot of
potential". And the star of stars? Analysts mention HP, Sun, Microsoft, Intel,
he notes "but IBM probably makes it to the top of the list". The computer
giant is sitting on a US$7 billion cash hoard and "cash might be king in a
technology stock correction".

Also, its various divisions are in good shape, with mainframe sales "steady",
storage manufacturing "growing very nicely" and its US$15 billion PC business
"finally looking like a contender".

What could go wrong? Mr Bosak, who's seen it all after 30 years in the
business, admits to a "greatest fear": recession.

Indeed the official line at Smith Barney is that "the slowdown (of the US
economy) is coming, it's just taking its sweet time".

The securities house expects real GDP growth to slow to 2.6 per cent in the
second half of this year, down from the 3.4 per cent of the first half; and to
decelerate further to between 1.0 and 1.5 per cent in the first half of next
year.

But if the slowdown tailspins into a recession, then all bets are off.

Internet takes centre stage at trade show: Novell unveils new products and
strategies at Networld

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

THE most recent major networking trade show, Networld+Interop, has just ended
here, with more than 60,000 participants seeking definitive networking
solutions from over 600 vendors, but largely finding them elusive.

Grown from an extremely modest event in 1986, when only 300 people attended,
it today represents a must-visit constellation in the galaxy of networking
events. Not surprising, then, that Novell chose this venue to introduce
IntranetWare, the latest, Internet-empowered version of NetWare.

IBM, showcasing its server families, anti-virus tools, and Internet abilities,
was also there, as was Lotus, promoting the new, Internet-capable Notes
Version 4.5. Microsoft, despite a highly publicised challenge from Novell
about whose network directory services were superior, essentially ignored the
Utah contingent and continued to promote Windows NT as the ideal network
server.

Industry professionals could also take a guided tour of the InteropNet, a
state-of-the-art network which tied together all exhibitors at the show.
Featuring ATM, FDDI, Fast Ethernet and the latest in diagnostic and monitoring
tools, it provided an operating, production-scale demonstration of the
industry's latest advances.

InteropNet runs TCP/IP, IPX and AppleTalk, uses twisted-pair copper, fiber
optic cable, and wireless connections, and contains nearly 200 km of cabling
to connect the show's 6,000 on-line devices.

Although it could safely be stated that the future of networking technology
was clearly represented on the show floor, choosing the winner of that
sweepstakes was not quite that simple. In fact, although the usual candidates
competed for attention and claimed superiority, it remained for the visiting
professional to determine the questions at the show, and resolve the answers
carefully over time.

In the broadband arena, there was no clearly superior solution. While numerous
vendors proclaimed that ATM and Frame Relay were available now, and costly
FDDI (fibre) begged for continuing attention, most professionals seemed to be
taking the cautious track. Many continued to look towards the proposed
1-gigabit Ethernet standard, perhaps because it does not seem to require such
a radical change in direction. The Novell caveat -that the best solution is
one that leverages existing technology without requiring that everything be
replaced -appeared to be right on the mark.

With relatively little truly new in the hardware arena, software took centre
stage, prominently featuring the Internet. The commercial future of the
Internet, hampered by security concerns, remains some distance down the road.
But corporate networks, featuring smooth integration of Internet access, are
readily available now, especially in the GroupWare and e-mail categories from
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell.

While professionals struggled to determine the best solutions to network
planning problems with global impact, and vendors invested millions in trying
to promote their message, a few unusual items stood out from the crowd; not
because of their gravity, but rather because they were different.

One of the most fascinating is a log-in authentication system from National
Registry Inc (NRI), of Reston, Virginia. Combining NRI's imaging software with
fingerprint recognition touchpads, NRIdentity Scanners come in two models, a
mouse-like pad which connects to a Enhanced Capabilities Parallel (ECP) Port,
and one built into a keyboard.

Together, they provide any Windows-based computer system with a biometric
scanning and identification system to control computer access, by comparing a
user's scanned fingerprint to an image previously placed in a database.

Current pricing is about US$400 (S$560), still a bit costly, but down
significantly from the US$1,000-US$2,000 of a few years ago. The company
anticipates significant further price drops with volume production, said
Robert Leamy, vice-president, Product Development. More info is available on
the World Wide Web at http://www.nrid.com.

Those who missed the show and would like an opportunity to draw their own
conclusions about the industry's future, can visit local versions next year.
In Singapore, Networld+Interop is scheduled to run from April 7 to 11.

Novell unveils new products and strategies at Networld: Internet takes
centre stage at trade show / Novell

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By David Welcher in Atlanta

BusinessIT

NOVELL Corporation, long seen by many industry observers as lacking a coherent
corporate marketing strategy, has apparently been listening to its critics. At
the just concluded Networld+Interop in Atlanta, Novell rolled out
IntranetWare, the latest iteration of its flagship NetWare product, and also
described a cohesive mission knitting together the strengths of its various
product groups.

Novell has been seen by many industry experts as marching to the wrong
drummer. This is because NetWare uses the IPX protocol, while most of the
industry, including the Internet, uses TCP/IP. In a move to correct this,
IntranetWare adds new services to Novell's NetWare 4.11 operating system to
provide a complete Intranet platform.

The defined mission, according to senior company officials, is to combine
NetWare, groupware, Internet browsing and Java development into a
comprehensive solution for providing corporations with Intranets.

As corporations seek to maximize the Internet's business potential, there is a
growing interest in Intranets, said William Donahoo, Novell's Director of
International Marketing. "Intranets are business networks used for corporate
information needs, which also utilise Internet technologies," he said.

IntranetWare provides both IP and IPX access to its Intranet resources, which
include Web servers and browsers, FTP servers, and Internet connections. The
arrangement provides a natural security firewall, Novell officials explained,
since unauthorised access from the Internet cannot penetrate the NetWare IPX
gateway to access corporate NetWare servers.

Novell's installed customer base includes 3.5 million servers and 55 million
users. The new strategy is intended to capitalise on its core networking
strengths, as well as leverage its 55 million-strong user base. The "glue"
intended to cement together this new corporate strategy is Novell Directory
Services (NDS), which is widely considered to be one of Novell's strongest
assets. NDS allows users to see other file servers as directories, and will
now be able to do the same for Internet sites.

Novell is not only targeting its own installed base, but is promoting NDS to
vendors of competing operating systems. "Other operating system vendors want
to use NDS," said Michael Simpson, Director of Novell's Internet
Infrastructure Division. "It is, in fact, intended to be OS portable. Only 9
per cent of the code is platform specific."

Novell expects to see considerable revenue from this new initiative, Mr
Simpson said.

Heading off the obvious question of whether NetWare's future was questionable,
Mr Simpson emphatically stated: "This is a new revenue potential, not a hedge
in case NetWare slips." SCO released an NDS-aware version last January, and
negotiations are under way with numerous others, he said.

The upgrade needs of Novell's existing customers have also been carefully
considered, said Denice Gibson, Novell senior vice-president, at
IntranetWare's formal rollout last Tuesday. "Customers are looking to
implement Internet solutions, and they need to seamlessly turn existing
technology into Intranets with minimum disruption and cost," she explained.
"They are not interested in a solution which requires them to rip out
everything they have."

"To both do this and give them best of breed technology, we are partnering
with other companies to provide this," she added.

Major partners who have signed on with Novell in the effort include Netscape,
whose browser will give NetWare users access to the Internet, and UUNet, which
has the network in place to deliver the necessary information.

Although all this comes too late for ex-CEO Robert Frankenberg, who resigned
in August, it seems to directly echo his previously stated vision of Novell's
future. Frankenberg's address at the November, 1995 Comdex, envisioned a
"Smart Global Network, incorporating NetWare, the Netscape browser, and Sun's
Java language as the core of a global data communications network."

IntranetWare will be available on Oct 7, and carries no increase in price from
previous versions. Limited time incentives are being offered to encourage
existing users to upgrade.

Summing up Novell's message that its customers need not look elsewhere for
answers, Ms Gibson concluded: "To our 55 million users, we say tonight: Look
at what you've got."

Microsoft NT 4.0, Workstation 4.0 hit the market

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Toh Han Shih

BusinessIT

[SINGAPORE] Amid analysts' predictions that Microsoft NT will gain market
share from Novell NetWare, Microsoft last week launched its latest software
server, the NT 4.0, as well as its client operating system, Workstation 4.0.

Microsoft is giving the NT 4.0 Internet and Intranet features, as is Novell
with its latest NetWare, as both try to outdo each other in the software
server market.

Microsoft back office manager Yong Yun Seong said NT 4.0 has Intranet
capability, in addition to the application's support, file and print
capability of earlier versions.

NT 4.0's new Intranet features include Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, which allows
users to publish Web pages easily; Microsoft Index Server; an Internet search
engine; and Internet security. NT 4.0 is optimised for broad bandwidth
networks like Fast Ethernet and allows users to make local calls for remote
Internet access to their corporate LANs.

Dataquest industry analyst Janardan Menon said Novell would continue to lose
market share to NT at an even more accelerated rate than last year.

He attributed this to the growing popularity in the corporate world of
Microsoft Workstation as a client operating system, which is designed to fit
in with NT. He said that although NetWare is compatible with Workstation,
people would prefer to have the same operating system from the same company on
both the client and server.

Mr Menon added that Intel would promote NT because NT requires Intel's Pentium
Pro chips to run.

"It's not only the product that matters, but the marketing around it," he
said, adding that NetWare's network directory services are superior to NT's
equivalent.

Ray Chang, chief executive officer of AsiaConnect, a Malaysian company that is
one of Asia's largest providers of Internet Web sites, offered a more extreme
opinion. "I don't think Novell stands a chance against NT," he said.

"NT is scaleable, cheap, seamlessly integrated to the Internet and easy to
implement. NetWare does not seamlessly fit into the Internet as well as NT."

Now, over 60 per cent of the world's PC LANs use Novell NetWare, and it is
easier for these NetWare users to upgrade to future versions of NetWare than
to NT, according to Novell Asia-Pacific marketing manager Jason Pan.

Microsoft's Mr Yong said NT 4.0 is compatible with NetWare, so companies that
deploy NetWare can add NT 4.0.

Microsoft has also provided tools to allow users to migrate from NetWare to NT
4.0.

Workstation is part of Microsoft's plan to target the corporate market. Mr
Menon said corporate users would prefer Workstation to Windows 95 because the
former is pure 32-bit and more robust.

Microsoft marketing manager Natasha Kwan said PCs with Workstation would be
powerful enough to move into the workstation market. However, Microsoft
Singapore managing director Paul Lovell admitted Workstation consumes so much
power that notebooks need a power cable to operate Workstation.

Wing Tai net earnings jump 73% to $145m / Wing Tai Holdings, DNP Holdings

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

Result beats market forecasts by $20m; more project profits booked than
expected

[SINGAPORE] Wing Tai Holdings has reported a 73 per cent rise in net profit to
$145 million for the year to June 30, higher than market forecasts by about
$20 million.

Wing Tai, which started out making garments but now makes its money from
property, said it would wind down its loss-making garment manufacturing
business in Singapore. But it will continue profitable garment-making
operations in Malaysia through associate DNP Holdings.

Space vacated by the manufacturing operations at its Tampines headquarters
building will be leased out. The site may be redeveloped in future -its
location in a housing district and near a proposed MRT station makes it ideal
for a residential project.

Almost all of 1996 (and 1995) earnings came from Singapore property projects
sold in the early '90s.

In the second half, the group earned almost $100 million more than it did in
the first half. Analysts said forecasts were off the mark as Wing Tai booked
more profit from development projects than they had provided for.

In the period under review, the group recognised 40 per cent of total bookings
from Maplewoods, 29 per cent from Palm Springs and 30 per cent from the
Hougang Mall it sold to NTUC Income. Pre-tax profits came to $238 million, up
68 per cent from last year. Turnover rose 53 per cent to $573 million.

Earnings per share jumped to 25.7 cents from 14.9 cents. Net tangible assets
went up to $2.06 per share from $1.84 per share. Directors recommended a
dividend of 20 per cent, the same as last year.

Sales of its new housing projects here are steady. The just-launched Sunrise
Gardens sold 50 per cent of its 252 units in a week. The Bedok apartments were
priced at $580 per square foot and marketed just after the "Ghost Month"
ended.

Sales at the 251-unit Duchess Crest improved to 65 per cent, up from 45 per
cent in July. Analysts say sales improved after Wing Tai took the $1,000 psf
project to Hongkong to sell.

Between now and mid-1997, Wing Tai will sell four more projects -one
commercial (Bencoolen Street) and three residential.

Another 400-unit Bukit Timah project on the Rothmans site will be sold only in
1998.

50% of profit to come from overseas / Wing Tai

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Michelle Low

[SINGAPORE] By the turn of the century, half of Wing Tai's profits will come
from overseas property projects in Hongkong and Malaysia.

The largest single project on Wing Tai's plate now is the massive Airport
Railway Kowloon Station Development in Hongkong. Wing Tai leads a consortium
in developing the HK$7.7 billion (S$1.4 billion) residential project, phase
one of a seven-phase project.

The first phase will have about 1.6 million square feet of built-up area. Wing
Tai, which has a 30 per cent interest in the project, declined to give profit
estimates.

But analysts suggest that at a conservative selling price of HK$7,000 per
square foot, the first phase could generate revenue of close to HK$12 billion.
Subtracting a cost of close to HK$5,000 psf, profit could be more than HK$3
billion.

The group was mostly silent on China, except to say that activities were "at a
relatively low level" but "longer term prospects are positive". Wing Tai is
involved in the Suzhou Industrial Park and is also building apartments in
Suzhou's New District.

In Malaysia, associate DNP has "started to make property development and
investment a core business".

DNP owns 14.3 million sq ft of commercial and residential land in Kuala Lumpur
and Penang.

As part of its regional focus, Wing Tai is also planning a chain of high-end
service apartments under the Lanson Place brand.

Some 700 units in four projects are being built in Singapore (Winsland House
II), Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Two developments start operating next year.

Two separate events may share a common link

WHAT has Tung Chee Hwa's candidacy for the post of chief executive of the
Special Administrative Region government and the settlement of a long-delayed
container terminal project have in common? On the surface, the link is
shipping. Mr Tung is chairman of Orient Overseas International Ltd, which owns
shipping firm Orient Overseas Container Line.

But hidden beneath the waves, the link could well be China, extending a
"guiding hand".

Mr Tung's declaration puts to rest months of speculation about the intention
of the hottest favourite for Hongkong's top post-1997 job. Pro-China and
pro-business parties will be relieved by his declared interest, while liberals
will see the development as part of a staged competition. After all, the
low-key shipping tycoon has been tipped to be China's prefered candidate and
is expected by many to toe the "make money, not democracy" line.

His candidacy may even provide comfort to some pro-British elements since he
was also a member of the Governor's advisory body. As for those without a
stand, Mr Tung has at least widened the field for a contest which has so far
yielded only two other candidates.

Yet, all is not rosy. Is a businessman with huge interests in Hongkong and
China and business partners like Li Ka-shing right for the job? To reassure
doubters, Mr Tung plans to resign from all his key positions and stay away
from the selection committee which will elect the chief executive. He will
also transfer his business interests to other family members.

More importantly, however, is whether the selection process will be fair and
transparent. To many people here, the choice of the chief executive has
already been made by Beijing.

Meanwhile, Secretary of Economic Services Stephen Ip called a press briefing
with the major port operators Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine, Wharf and Sealand to
announce the breakthrough in the agreement on CT9 (Container Terminal Nine).

He had difficulty assuring and reassuring the media that the CT9 agreement was
a purely commercial deal and no political pressure was made to reduce
Jardine's role.

Despite his efforts, it seemed that none of the journalists who attended the
briefing came away convinced. As far as the media was concerned, the British
hong was clearly the loser. After four years of highly-charged political
wrangling between the British and Chinese, Jardine's participation has been
reduced from a lead role in a new terminal to a secondary stake in a
restructured consortium which will take over two existing berths at CT8. The
group gets no part at all in CT9.

Optimists say, however, that the two berths will ensure that Jardine still has
a role in the thriving port business here. Also, Hongkong finally gets to
expand its port capacity and the government can now move on to tendering CT10
and CT11.

As for China, it now badly needs to show the world that the impasse over CT9
was an isolated case and no such wrangling will happen again in future
"commercial" deals.

Do we see a show of hands?

SembCorp may inject transport and logistics into SML / Sembawang
Corporation, Sembawang Maritime, SML

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

[SINGAPORE] Sembawang Corp (SembCorp) has confirmed that it is considering
transferring some of its transport and logistics (T&L) businesses into
takeover target Sembawang Maritime Ltd (SML). This was revealed in SembCorp's
offer document to SML issued over the weekend.

"In line with the on-going restructuring of the SembCorp group's business
activities into five business groups, SembCorp may consider transferring
certain transportation and logistics businesses held by other companies within
the SembCorp group into SML."

SembCorp T&L president Billy Lee, who is also president of SML, told BT
earlier that the T&L division would be placed under one entity but declined to
name the umbrella company. Market watchers had speculated that SML would be
that entity.

SembCorp also said in its offer document that SembCorp, which owned 35.8 per
cent of SML's issued and paid-up capital as at Sep 16, may transfer some of
SML's business outside the transportation and logistics field to other
companies within the group. Such businesses could include the shiprepair
business.

Its voluntary conditional offer for SML will close on Oct 14, 1996, at 3.30pm.

Electronics : fall in export growth

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Eye on the Economy

By Genevieve Cua

Trade

GROWTH of domestic exports of the top three electronics items slowed
considerably in August, with the key disk drives segment expanding just 7.9
per cent after growth of as much as 50 per cent in January.

Integrated circuits made its worst showing this year with a year-on-year
contraction of nearly 18 per cent. Manufacturers exported $748 million worth
of ICs, compared to $912 million last year.

Data processing components and peripherals slipped 1.1 per cent, after a 20
per cent rise in January. The three items accounted for about 35 per cent of
August's non-oil domestic exports.

The latest trade figures released last Friday showed a worse-than-expected
fall in non-oil domestic exports of 6.3 per cent in nominal terms, and
detailed data on the major electronics items reflect manufacturers' woes.

HG Asia economist Song Seng Wun said: "The hard disk drive segment is showing
some stability but the semiconductor segment is under a heavy cloud. Product
prices are falling..."

He said checks on the local industry revealed a pick-up in orders ahead of
Christmas. "But these are hopeful purchases. Should there be signs of
inventory piling up again and weak sales, customers will turn around and
cancel orders."

"People are placing orders in anticipation of being able to flog them ahead of
Christmas, but if the US numbers remain depressed and demand is weak from
Europe, those orders will be cancelled," he said.

He said month-on-month numbers might look encouraging, but year-on-year
numbers were not.

"You're seeing the sharp impact of the decline in product prices."

In the personal computer segment, he said demand was growing by 20 per cent
while supply was rising by between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. "Something has
to give."

Economists expect the slowdown to last until the first quarter of 1997.

MIT to build integrated system to speed up production for chip firms /
Manufacturing Integration Technology Pte Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Clarissa Tan

MANUFACTURING Integration Technology (MIT) will be making life simpler for the
electronics industry.

The company intends to build an integrated system that will speed up the
manufacturing process for semiconductor companies, as well as allow
manufacturers to meet customer demands with greater accuracy.

"The integrated system will basically cut the time needed for the
manufacturing process," said MIT managing director Tony Kwong.

"The system does in half a day what others now do in six or seven.

"Also, at the packaging end, the system is an intelligent one and can place in
each package the exact amount that the customer requires."

Mr Kwong feels that this will help the related electronics industry to avoid
problems such as oversupply and the consequent fall in prices for electronics
goods.

When completed in about one and a half to two year's time, MIT's automated,
integrated system for semiconductor processing will be the first in South-east
Asia. The project, called the Fully Automated EOL Process, is being helped by
the Economic Development Board which has given MIT a $1.5 million grant.

Semiconductor firms need processing equipment at various stages of
manufacturing, such as testing, laser marking and packing. What MIT will do is
to integrate all these processes into one automated system. It will also
reduce labour.

Incorporated in 1992, MIT designs and builds processing equipment for
semiconductor firms. A family-owned company, it intends to be listed by
end-1998 or early-1999. Turnover for the company has been doubling every year
until this year, when it rose 20-30 per cent due to the slowdown in
electronics sector. Mr Kwong, expects turnover to start doubling again in the
next year.

Academic defends tender system: Housing cost not up as much as property
prices

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

EXCESSIVE demand, not the tender system, is the culprit that has pushed up
property prices in recent years, academic Jennifer Mao told the Cost Review
Committee on Friday.

"It is an over-demand problem," she said, fuelled by the opening of the HDB
resale market and the liberalisation of HDB and CPF for the purchase of
properties.

The tender system is only used as a convenient scapegoat by its critics, said
Ms Mao, a lecturer from the Department of Finance and Banking at the National
University of Singapore. "If the tender system is not used, whatever other
mechanism employed will be similarly blamed."

The tender system, she said, is superior to any other system to determine
prices -- especially when the true or fair value of land is hard to assess.

Ms Mao also defended the government's high reserve price in tendering out
land. "As the land belongs to all Singaporeans collectively, it is the
government's responsibility to capture as much as possible the full economic
value of the land," she said.

Housing cost not up as much as property prices: Academic defends tender
system

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Chuang Peck Ming

Chief statistician: consumption and investment distinct

THE cost of accommodation for home owners has not increased as much as the big
jumps in property prices would suggest, said government chief statistician
Paul Cheung on Friday.

His submission to a Cost Review Committee hearing, embargoed to be released
today, showed that the proxy measure of changes in housing cost -the annual
assessed value (AAV) estimated by the Chief Valuer of the Inland Revenue
Authority of Singapore -rose by single-digit figures, and not the double-digit
rises witnessed in the property market in recent years.

He said: "The owner-occupied housing sub-index (of the Consumer Price Index)
has increased by 5.1 per cent between 1992 and 1993 and 0.9 per cent during
1993-95. However, it declined by 0.2 per cent during January-June 1996."

A distinction has to be made between consumption and investment when the
buying price of a house or flat is considered, said Dr Cheung. The CPI, which
tracks price changes in consumption, is only interested in the shelter service
that is consumed. It does not take into consideration the house or flat as an
asset which can be sold for capital gains. Ordinarily, the CPI needs only to
track the changes in rentals to get a measure of the price changes in
accommodation, or user cost. But since most Singaporeans are owner-occupiers,
the rentals have to be imputed. And the AAV provides the best imputation. "The
rental equivalence approach for treatment of owner-occupied housing is
conceptually and methodologically sound," he said. "The same approach is
adopted in the compilation of national accounts statistics."

Electronics slump hits Singapore most : report

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Anna Teo

AMONG the region's economies, Singapore has probably been the hardest hit by
the global electronics slump, says Consensus Economics Inc, noting that the
average 1996 growth forecast had been cut to 7.4 per cent from 8.5 per cent in
the last two months.

The London-based firm's latest gross domestic product (GDP) growth average is
derived from 17 forecasters in early September, including NatWest Markets
which heads the list with an 8.5 per cent projection.

But NatWest has since sliced its 1996 Singapore growth forecast to 7 per cent,
which brings the Consensus Economics average down to 7.3 per cent.

A separate BT list of 19 GDP growth forecasts for 1996, ranging from J P
Morgan's 6 per cent to Nomura Research Institute's 7.6 per cent, produces an
average of 7.1 per cent.

Consensus Economics polls financial and economic forecasters around the world
every month for their estimates of key variables.

Its findings for Singapore show a GDP growth average of 5.3 per cent in the
third quarter (compared to a BT average of 4.6 per cent) and 6.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter (BT average: 6.1 per cent).

Manufacturing growth is expected to reach a trough of 4.5 per cent in the
third quarter this year, according to Consensus Economics' poll.

"Consumer sentiment, and thus spending, has also been badly affected by the
subsequent job-cutting in the manufacturing sector," it says, noting the
sluggish consumer demand reflected in weak retail sales.

Retail sales grew about 2.9 per cent over the first half of the year, and 4.3
per cent in July. The poor retail performance has reduced price pressures,
with inflation below 1.5 per cent in the last few months.

The government remains on course to reach its year-end inflation target of 1.5
per cent, says Consensus Economics.

But while most of Singapore's recent indicators show signs of an economic
slowdown, investment growth remains strong, rising by 23 per cent in the
second quarter. This has been reflected in an upward revision to the consensus
investment forecast to 11.9 per cent for 1996.

Boosted by robust investment growth, GDP growth is expected to recover by the
second quarter of 1997, says Consensus Economics.

[KUALA LUMPUR] Leader Universal Holdings Bhd has proposed to issue up to
US$125 million (S$175 million) Euro bonds to take advantage of its
substantially lower interest cost over local bank financing.

Commerce International Merchant Bankers Bhd said in a statement on behalf of
Leader Universal that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay bank
borrowings, additional investment in subsidiaries and the settlement of
expenses for the proposed exercise. The bonds will mature in seven years.

The proposed issue is not expected to have any effect on the company's net
tangible assets per share and earnings until such time when the bonds are
converted.

The bonds will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. -NST

Inchcape first-half profit down 23% to $24m / Inchape Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Rahita Elias

Decline due mainly to loss of contribution from Rolex

[SINGAPORE] Inchcape Berhad's net profit fell 23 per cent to $23.8 million for
the six months to June 30, 1996.

The trading firm said over the weekend that the loss of contribution from
Rolex Singapore Pte Ltd was the main reason for the fall. A 47 per cent rise
in interest expense to $4.4 million also dragged down its interim performance.

The fall was offset partially by a 29 per cent decline in taxes to $11.4
million.

Earnings per share (EPS) fell 23 per cent to 14.5 cents. Analysts polled by
The Estimate Directory have pegged Inchcape's full-year EPS at 30.7 cents,
down 14 per cent.

Group turnover was down 2 per cent to $643.8 million.

Profit before interest dropped 5 per cent to $39.3 million. This included
contributions from associates.

Of the total, its "motors business stream" generated some $21.1 million -down
25 per cent year-on-year.

The "marketing business stream" fared better with profit rising 61 per cent to
$8.4 million. Its consumer division did particularly well, with profit
tripling to $6.4 million. It had benefited from the rationalisation of loss
makers last year and the disposal of the office automation business.

Meanwhile, Inchcape's shipping business incurred a loss of $200,000 compared
to a $200,000 profit in the same period last year.

Its financial services business saw profit before interest rose 25 per cent to
$9.5 million. IRB Finance, which mainly finances retail car purchases in
Brunei, had benefited from the higher value of car sales financed.

Directors declared an interim dividend of 10 cents per share before tax,
unchanged from the same period last year.

On current year prospects, they said the second half would be a challenging
time for the group, especially in the motor industry. "Notwithstanding that,
(we) believe that, excluding the discontinued Rolex business, the group will
be able to maintain a similar level of profit as in 1995."

State-owned BNI's IPO on track / Bank Negara Indonesia, BNI

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By S N Vasuki in Jakarta

Bank's massive float next month seen bringing investors back into market

STATE-OWNED Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) has filed a registration statement
with Indonesian regulators, paving the way for its massive initial public
offer next month. BNI is the first state-owned bank to be privatised in
Indonesia.

The bank said over the weekend that it would float 25 per cent of its paid-up
capital in the IPO and is awaiting formal approval from the Indonesian Capital
Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam).

Analysts had earlier speculated that the size of the issue would be around one
trillion rupiah (S$608 million) with market capitalisation of four trillion
rupiah.

BNI shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges though
the bank said that it is also open to international investors. The IPO will be
underwritten by Danareksa Securitas while Lehman Brothers will act as the
international adviser.

The BNI issue comes at a time when sentiment on the local stock market has
turned bearish. Foreign investors, who dominate trading on the Jakarta bourse,
have pulled out of the market over political succession concerns.

The July 27 riots that rocked Jakarta have further eroded confidence.

Not surprisingly, this has not been a particularly good year for IPOs.
Analysts have revised downwards earlier estimates of US$1.5 billion (S$2.11
billion) being raised through new offerings in 1996. Nevertheless, the BNI
offer is expected to bring investors back into the market.

The BNI issue will be the only Indonesian state-owned firm to go public in
1996. Besides BNI, the government originally had ambitious plans to float
three other state firms this year.

These are toll-road operator PT Jasa Marga, steel firm Krakatau Steel and
international carrier Garuda Indonesia. But the flotations have been delayed
because of international perception that these state firms are not performing
well and hence the government would not be able to set an attractive price.

BNI, which is the largest of Indonesia's seven state-owned banks, is also the
healthiest. At end-June, the bank had assets of 32 trillion rupiah and
reported revenue of 17 trillion rupiah.

The bank said that between 1993 and 1995 its net earnings rose from 245
billion rupiah to 378.7 billion rupiah. BNI has a capital adequacy ratio of
9.1 per cent and a loan-deposit ratio of 86.3 per cent.

BNI proposes to use the IPO proceeds to fund its investment and development
programme. The bank operates 489 branches in Indonesia and six overseas. Its
core business is corporate and retail banking.

Extending trading net into retail / EasyKnit International Holdings Ltd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

COMPANY VISIT EasyKnit Int'l Holdings

Easyknit defies narrow margins and competition to launch its own fashion brand

AT A time when many garment retailers are facing intense competition and
narrowing margins, Matthew Koon is doing what some analysts here would imagine
to be the unthinkable -launching his own fashion brand name and chain of
retail stores in the region.

The founder of listed Easyknit International Holdings is also planning for a
secondary listing in Singapore to help finance his new venture.

About 80 million shares or 20 per cent of the existing capital would be
issued. The Singa pore offer is expected within the next two weeks. Analysts
expect the company to raise up to HK$250 million (S$46 million) from the
issue.

The funds will help Easyknit develop its own fashion brand name, Library. The
company plans to open 10 Library outlets here by the first quarter of next
year, before penetrating Taiwan and China's markets.

Mr Koon says: "We have a very strong design team and we have a very strong
supplier network. We can offer many styles at lower costs."

In fact, much of Easyknit's success in recent years had been attributed to the
group's unusual relationship with its 16 or so suppliers. Years ago, Mr Koon
parcelled out production functions to his employees and helped them set up
their own businesses.

Now they are his suppliers, helping him to source for cheap materials from
around the world while he focuses on expanding his export markets.

"I lent them money and now I'm taking my money back. Some are my long-time
friends. Some are my ex-employees," said Mr Koon.

"They only concentrate on working for me. We both make money together. My
material costs are about 10 per cent lower than my competitors."

Easyknit's links with its suppliers are further stamped by exclusive contracts
which last for 10 years each.

Mr Koon, who won the Young Entrepreneur of the Year award in 1994, employs a
small number of staff compared to his listed rivals. Easyknit has only about
70 employees, dealing in marketing and merchandising. Still, turnover for the
year ended March 31, 1996 came to HK$1.2 billion and net profit, HK$104.6
million.

In comparison, Glorious Sun Enterprise, which employs more than 1,000 people,
has a turnover of about HK$1.6 billion.

Mr Koon is confident that the new retail business would be profitable by the
first year. "It is because we don't keep inventories. We don't do the
production. We can test market first and then we make bulk orders. We don't
get stuck with inventories."

Besides going into the retail business, the company is also expected to
generate property income from its investment in a new building.

Easyknit recently bought a plot of land and is developing its new 27-floor
headquarters on the Cheung Sha Wan site in Kowloon. The property investment
will help to diversify its earnings base from 1998.

The recent diversification into retail and property has gone down well with
analysts. Analysts expect the company's rental income to hit HK$10 million a
year and the retail business to contribute about 20 per cent of turnover from
next year.

As for its core trading business, the company will continue to enjoy low
material costs, quick turnaround times and strong profit margins, thanks to
its exclusive contracts with suppliers in low cost countries such as
Indonesia, China and Honduras.

Analysts expect Easyknit's net profit to grow by at least 20 per cent in the
current year to about HK$146 million and to HK$174 million in the following
year.

GIC, DBS Land among S'pore groups vying for HK$7b project

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Quak Hiang Whai in Hongkong

SINGAPORE's interest in Hongkong's real estate market remains unabated as
several of the republic's biggest property groups joined in the territory's
latest land tender for a HK$7 billion (S$1.3 billion) airport-railway station
property project.

At the close of the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) tender on Friday,
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), the Hong Leong Group
and DBS Land were among the over 30 companies which formed 12 consortiums to
bid for the second phase of the Tung Chung MTRC project.

With previous MTRC tenders attracting only five to six consortiums each, the
latest tender for Tung Chung will be the hottest contest ever for an MTR site.
The Tung Chung site is the first station linked to the proposed airport at
Chek Lap Kok island.

Hong Leong and GIC, which were unsuccessful for the prestigious HK$40 billion
Central MTR tender earlier this year, joined Hongkong China and HKR
International for the contest.

DBS Land, which has teamed up with Ng Teng Fong's Sino Land for several
Hongkong property projects, was part of the consortium which includes Sino
Land, Tai Cheung Holdings and Great Eagle Holdings.

Last year, DBS Land joined the winning consortium led by Sino Land for the
HK$12 billion Tai Kok Tsui MTR mixed project. DBS Land is expected to join
Sino Land for phase three of the same project.

The MTRC has so far awarded six contracts along the airport railway line,
including phase one of the HK$70 billion Kowloon project which was won by a
Singapore-dominated consortium. That consortium was led by the Wing Tai Group
with participation from Singapore Land, Straits Steamship Land and Temasek
Holdings. Property developers like airport railway projects because of the
mixed features and proximity to the railway line.

Analysts say the record numbers of bids for the second phase of Tung Chung
project reflects the reviving bullish sentiment in the Hongkong residential
property market. Analysts also attributed the strong response to the smaller
size of the development.

East Asian gold demand slumped in first half

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Neil Behrmann in London

Consultancy says China leads region in falling demand

GOLD demand in East Asia, particularly China, slumped in the first half of the
year, according to a London-based consultant.

Gold Fields Mineral Services, a respected and well-connected consultancy,
estimated that fabrication demand from East Asia, including Japan, slid to 485
tons in the first six months of the year from 572 tons in the same period in
1995.

Consumption in China contracted to only 69 tons from 128 tons in the same
period. Hoarding of gold in East Asia shrank to 61 tons from 140 tons and in
China the amount was only two tons in the first half, compared with 13 tons in
the same 1995 time-frame.

In the early part of the year when gold touched a year-high of US$418 an
ounce, there was resistance to higher prices, the consultant said.

"But China's slump in gold purchases is also the result of a prolonged
austerity campaign, the stabilisation of the currency and a growing preference
for jewellery set with diamonds and other gems," said Stewart Murray, chief
executive of Gold Fields Mineral Services.

In contrast, Middle Eastern gold jewellery consumption and hoarding, jumped to
271 tons in the first six months from 230 tons the previous year. Consumption
and hoarding in India rose to 321 tons from 296 tons and good weather for
farmers points to a continuation of this trend, forecast Mr Murray.

Despite a sound market in the Indian sub continent and the Middle East, global
gold demand fell 8.3 per cent to 1,727 tons in the six months to end-June
1996. In the major European nations, spending on gold jewellery fell because
of a worsening economic climate and rising unemployment. Gold prices,
presently languishing around US$383 an ounce, down 8 per cent from their
January peaks, have also fallen because of an increase in supply.

Year-on-year global mine production rose 3.2 per cent to 1,120 tons in the
first of the year and gold scrap recycling by 15 per cent to 338 tons.
Disenchanted investors who had bought at high prices in 1995 and early 1996
off-loaded 160 tons between February and the end of June.

Central bank sales dipped to 108 tons in the first half of 1996 from 196 tons
in 1995, but the timing of the supplies contributed to the market depression.
Mr Murray said he believed there were secret sales over and above this amount.

He expects gold consumption to improve in the coming months ahead of Christmas
and Chinese New Year in late January. Yet, the price will only rise if there
is lower producer and central bank sales. The market is uncertain about the
psychological impact of potential International Monetary Fund sales of 155
tons.

Fed seen staying its hand

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Simex Weekly Roundup

By Collum Henderson

Interest rate differentials still hold key to strength of greenback

[SINGAPORE] Will they or won't they? It's definitely a close call. On balance,
however, MMS expects the Fed to continue to stay its hand -the Reuters story
notwithstanding.

Fed governors have proved less hawkish this time than their regional Fed
colleagues and are notably more reluctant to simply fight growth, particularly
when inflationary pressures remain very muted.

Granted, the Philly Fed price component rise is a concern, but the latest
Producer Price Index, and more importantly Consumer Price Index, data suggest
that there continues to be no inflation problem as yet.

Some might see the upcoming US presidential election as an obstacle to any Fed
tightening. However there is surely no question that Alan Greenspan would hike
now if he thought it was warranted, whether or not he was ever invited to sit
next to Hillary again.

We expect steady Fed policy this week -followed by a 50 basis point tightening
at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting just after the election.
So what does this mean for the US dollar?

The forex market is pricing in a Fed tightening this week, resulting in the
dollar trading higher. No Fed rate hike means the US dollar is likely to see
those gains eroded very quickly.

The Fed statement, if there is any, will be important. Going forward, the key
will be consequent rate expectations -the dollar will not suffer as much if
the market continues to expect the Fed to hike.

Interest rate differentials, rather than trade fundamentals, remain the key
for now. Near term, we do not expect any change in the official interest rate
differential between the US, and Germany and Japan. Thus, the dollar should
soften near term from here.

Aside from the FOMC, we have a full slate of data this week. First off, today,
is the Italian September CPI data. Though most attention is focused on
government attempts to bring forward a credible 1997 budget, this data should
confirm that inflationary pressures in Italy are continuing to decline
-leaving the Bank of Italy room after the budget to ease rates further.

German COL and Import Price data for September and August respectively is due
tomorrow. MMS expects these to show price pressures remaining equally muted in
Germany.

Also coming out tomorrow is the UK's Q2 Gross Domestic Product data. The
market has already priced in steady Bank of England policy from here given the
extent of the rebound.

Column:  Warrant Watch

By R Sivanithy

THE KL Second Board is now at dangerously high levels and if it cracks,
speculative money will channel itself into other areas. One prime candidate is
of course the KL main board, so it might make sense for punters to quietly
position themselves in warrants listed on the main board.

One possibility is the Johan 1999 warrant which is also traded
over-the-counter here on Clob International. This is one of the few warrants
that's out-of-the-money -the exercise price is M$2.50 compared to the shares
at M$2.26.

As such, regular readers will know that the conversion premium must be high
and at M$1.01 per warrant, this works out to 55 per cent. Gearing is slightly
above average at 2.24 times and the instrument has about 28 months left to
run.

To be honest, the numbers are not convincing as a 55 per cent premium for time
is a lot to pay for. But the stock is way off its 52-week high of M$3.28, it
has proven in the past to be a favourite among punters and the warrant is
cheap in absolute terms. If the Second Board does undergo its much needed
correction, this warrant could benefit. -By R Sivanithy

All eyes likely to remain on KLSE's Second Board

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By R Sivanithy

Liquidity in S'pore stocks improving but sobering trade figures will rein in
further rises

STOCK MARKET COMMENTARY

[SINGAPORE] Anyone who raised the possibility at the start of the year that
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Second Board would be occupied by
billion-ringgit companies before the year-end would probably have been scoffed
at.

Not now, of course. Not when the Second Board Index has more than doubled and
it's hosting two counters that have crossed the M$100 level.

Last week, the index set four record highs and, as usual, dominated the market
-more than M$1 billion was traded daily, which is significantly more than the
$325.71 million average chalked up by the entire local market comprising the
main board, Clob and Sesdaq.

Brokers here tell of harrowing sessions every day as excited clients, lured by
the double-digit gains, call constantly to place huge orders, for which few
actually have the funds to pay. One stressed dealer at a foreign brokerage
said: "Clients buy in the morning, sell before lunch and buy again after
lunch. This goes on throughout the day, and all in minimum lots of
30,000-50,000 and all on a contra basis. I've actually had to talk them out of
some trades."

If retail punters here are minting money on the Second Board, then imagine
what the impact has been on the personal wealth of some of the people who own
significant stakes in Second Board companies. Take, for instance, Wan Adli Wan
Ibrahim, a relatively unknown Berjaya group executive director who currently
chairs two Second Board companies, Transwater and Bridgecon.

Having just bought 50.84 per cent of Transwater's capital for M$15 per share
or M$99.1 million last month, Mr Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$100 per
share, or about M$661 million. On paper, he is sitting on M$561.82 million of
profit.

As for Bridgecon, he raised his stake to 20 per cent just before the shares
were suspended last week. The stock jumped 68 per cent to M$32 when trading
resumed on Friday. Wan Adli's stake is now worth M$127.68 million, bringing
the combined value of his Transwater and Bridgecon shares to M$788.68 million.

Along the way, Transwater said it had submitted a M$1.1 billion bid to the
government to rebuild the Johor-Singapore Causeway, while Bridgecon announced
an increase in its rights issue, an acquisition of land costing M$463 million,
and an acquisition of its shares by SAP Holdings managing director Raduan
Taib, who bought a 36 per cent stake at M$20 per share. Both Wan Adli and Mr
Raduan have Vincent Tan's Berjaya Group to thank for their instant wealth --
the conglomerate is believed to be the main contender for the Causeway's
reconstruction and is the party which sold the land to Bridgecon.

Transwater, whose shares traded at M$5 last November and M$15 in August, is
now capitalised at about M$1.3 billion. No doubt if Bridgecon continues to
make similarly exciting announcements as it did last week, it too will join
Transwater in the billion-ringgit club.

The Second Board, no doubt, will continue to dominate trading but it is
uncertain which direction it would take. Most analysts are now calling for a
long overdue correction and hopefully, when this happens, it won't be too
painful for those involved.

As for the local market, it would be unfair to say that interest is
non-existent as liquidity has improved. However, although the Straits Times
Industrials Index managed to break 2,200 during the week, its inability to
hold onto its gains and Friday's sobering trade figures will probably rein in
any further rises.

On the external front, the US Federal Reserve meets tomorrow for its regular
interest rate meeting. The long bond yield on Friday was largely unchanged at
7.05 per cent, suggesting that any forthcoming rate hike has already been
factored into prices.

According to NatWest Markets, the market has "already priced in a rate hike of
25 basis points and should not encounter a substantial gyration even if the
Fed were to raise rates. A major surprise would be a larger hike, say 50 basis
points, or "rate inaction".

Whether or not the Fed acts or not remains to be seen. Meanwhile, all eyes
will still be on the Second Board.

Banking reforms end era of profligacy: Uncertain future for Laotian
T-bonds

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

[SINGAPORE] Before 1976, Lao guerillas ran their own parallel economy. The
zone, controlled by guerillas of the Lao Patriotic Front, had its own
currency, and its own mechanism for distributing money in provinces it
occupied.

The zone under the US-leaning Vientiane government consisted of a central
bank, and six private banks.

After liberation, the existing banks were nationalised by the Lao Patriotic
Front which committed the deadly mistake of consolidating all commercial
banking activities into the central bank, the National Bank of Laos.

Soon afterwards, the name of the central bank was changed to State Bank, and,
as its name suggested, the bank extended loans primarily to state firms, while
retaining the exclusive right to issue currency. The State Bank established a
network of 96 branches across the country. It was only in 1988 that autonomous
state-owned commercial banks were allowed to start.

When the late strongman Kaysone Phomvihane launched reforms under the New
Economic Mechanism the same year, the central bank was restructured into a new
entity, the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and a two-tier
banking system introduced to separate central banking from commercial
functions.

First signs that the government would relax entry rules for foreign banks came
with the establishment of a semi-private bank in 1989 in which both the state
and private firms held shares.

These reforms put an end to an era of profligacy when state firms had
unfettered access to central bank funds at negative interest rates. The
government, for the first time, in 1991 introduced minimum and maximum
interest rates. Interest rate controls were scrapped in mid-1993. The only
controls left were a minimum savings deposit rate, and a maximum lending rate.

It was the reformed banking sector that introduced bonds and T-Bills. Now with
Laos set to join Asean, it has set its sights on issuing long-term bonds.

Uncertain future for Laotian T-bonds: Banking reforms end era of
profligacy

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Harish Mehta

Inflation deflates euphoria that came with launch of short-term bonds in 1991

[SINGAPORE] WHEN Laos launched its first government bonds five years ago,
residents of the capital, Vientiane, were delighted by the novelty of earning
interest at double-digit rates.

The euphoria accompanying the introduction of short-term bonds in 1991 is
over. Bond issues have been hit since last year because inflation runs at more
than 19 per cent.

Things are just as bad this year. As a result, the government has stopped
issuing long-term bonds. For now, it offers only six-month bonds that earn
half-yearly interest of about 10 per cent.

Laotians venture into the bond market as their kip-deposits in banks earn
lower annual interest of 16 per cent. But even so, interest gains are being
wiped out by inflation. Many Laotians, in the days of single-digit inflation
in 1994, were able to save a small part of their salary, and happily parked
what they saved in short-term bonds. But since last year, as prices of
essential goods rose, the choices for the man on the street, with an average
annual income of US$331 (S$463), were clear: food came before all else.

Sharp price rises between March and September last year triggered substantial
depreciation of the kip, which lost about 27 per cent of its value as the
currency plunged to about 1,000 to the US dollar in September last year from
734 six months earlier.

Pany Yathotou, the governor of the Bank of the Lao People's Democratic
Republic (PDR), the central bank, said: "When inflation was low, even
foreigners bought bonds through their relatives living in Laos. But with
higher inflation, they're not buying them anymore."

Bonds issued by the central bank and the Ministry of Finance look like a cash
certificate, and come in a maximum denomination of 10 million kips (about
US$10,520).

Laotians fret about three issues -the climbing rate of inflation, constant
danger of kip devaluation, and the lack of a secondary market.

So kips are often converted into Laotians' favourite currencies -US dollar and
Thai baht.

Although the future of bonds is hobbled by a lack of a secondary market, Ms
Pany said bond holders could redeem them at the central bank.

Her predecessor, Bousbong Souvannavong, said before a secondary market could
be created, it was necessary for the central bank to issue sufficient paper in
the primary market. "Once the market is sufficiently liquid, will it make
sense to talk of a market price," he added.

Until a secondary market can develop, Laotians will have limited opportunities
of converting their bonds into cash.

Mr Bousbong said the underdeveloped state of the financial markets was due to
errors of the recent past. The government handed over the power to issue
currency to the governor of the central bank as late as in 1990. That ended a
period when the government extended interest-free loans to state companies.

Laotian bonds also have a strategic difference from bonds issued by other
developing countries: the Bank of Lao PDR issues bonds as a monetary
instrument to mop up excess liquidity in the economy, not to raise capital.

"For infrastructure development we would need a long-term maturity of bonds,"
Ms Pany said, "but we have issued only short-term bonds."

Three years after the bonds came on the market, the Laotian Ministry of
Finance began issuing Treasury bills to soak up a very liquid economy. The
first auction took place in March 1994, and auctions of one billion kip are
held once every two weeks.

The government now needs bonds and T-bills more than ever as the threat of
inflation is growing, and the economy is skidding.

Mr Bousbong explained that since Laos introduced financial reforms in 1988,
one of the main objectives was to "curtail liquidity expansion that had
resulted from the easy access state-owned enterprises had to bank credit at
negative interest rates". To tackle the crisis, the government adopted a
positive interest rate policy in August 1989. It ensured interest rates would
be higher than the inflation rate, lending rates higher than deposit rates,
and long-term rates higher than short-term rates.

In time, the central bank will be compelled to create a variety of riskier
instruments such as corporate bonds and equities. Perhaps, the electricity and
water utilities should be encouraged to issue their own paper. A next logical
step would be the creation of financial institutions such as pension funds and
insurance firms.

ShipRepair 96 : a chance to find out what competitors are doing

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

Column:  Dockyard

By David Hughes

THIS time of the year is always marked by a flurry of conferences, conventions
and exhibitions. This year is no exception with the normal northern autumn
crop of events, on everything from Ship's Agency and Crime at Sea to Arresting
Ships.

Being somewhat the Cinderella of the shipping industry, despite its crucial
importance, there is not much of interest to the repair and conversion sector.
But it does have one annual gathering, at London's Olympia, in early November.
The organisers of ShipRepair & Conversion 96 have just put out the publicity
for the two-day conference and exhibition.

Once again Alan Thorpe and Ronald Sim have put together a well thought-out
programme. The conference covers a wide range of topical issues, though with
perhaps some emphasis on tankers and dry bulk carriers.

The conference, as ever, tackles a mixture of technical and commercial
subjects.

The first session looks at something that ought to be dear to every yard
managers' heart, money. The initial paper looks at how repairers can help
themselves by getting contracts right to start with. Solicitor Mike Lax,
partner with UK law firm Lawrence Graham, provides "A Practical and Legal
Guide to Enforcement under Shiprepair Contracts".

There will be more than enough to keep those who go to ShipRepair mainly for
its technical content happy. The only reservation in this regard is that the
organisers make use of "technical workshops" which take place in parallel with
the presentation of the main papers on both mornings.

Having more than one presentation at a time has its drawbacks. Firstly it
assumes that people interested in, for example, listening to a paper on
Pollution-free Sterntube Seals will not be just as keen to attend the
presentation on Planning for Special Surveys.

To be fair, the organisers have to weigh up all sorts of practical
considerations and still try to pack in as much as possible. Probably the main
problem is that two days is not really long enough to do justice to the
shiprepair and conversion industry.

And there is certainly is a terrific amount packed into this programme. But
most of the presentations are from representatives of European-based companies
and organisations.

There is, though, one Singapore-based speaker. Sigurd Gude, executive
vice-president of Kvaerner Ships Equipment, will be presenting Service
Agreements -Predictable Maintenance Cost True or False. Also from this region,
Hongkong United Dockyards managing director Chris Pooley will present The
Future of Hongkong's Repair Industry after 1997.

The European emphasis should not deter anybody from the Asia-Pacific region
from attending. This is the one annual opportunity to find out what
competitors are doing, and thinking, especially what they think about
competition from Asian yards.

ShipRepair ventures into the area of competition between the major
shiprepairing countries. On the first day there is a panel discussion on the
European shiprepair market. This focuses on competition within Europe and
particularly on the impact of the yards in what was the Eastern Bloc.

Polish yards already have a formidable reputation for cheaper steel repairs.
Now they are moving into technically more complicated areas. That worries the
repairers in western Europe, whose views should be well represented in the
debate.

The European yards are also worried by competition from this region for
conversion contracts. So the second day will see Peter Fetton from the UK's
A&P Group asking: "Is the European conversion industry competitive against the
Far East?"

Since Mr Fetton's paper is preceded by two about current FPSO conversions in
European yards, the answer to his question seems self-evident. After all
Singapore yards, for example, are not inexperienced with, or slow to bid for,
FPSO conversion work.

The reality is that much of the world's repair and conversion business is
subject to intense competition, driven by severe overcapacity, and winning
contracts depends on providing dependable quality at a keen price. That
applies wherever your yard happens to be.

Lumut port expects cargo volume to double

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

[KUALA LUMPUR] Lumut port in Perak has projected an 80-100 per cent increase
in cargo throughput to 600,000 tonnes by the end of this year from the level
achieved in its first year of operations which ended in July 1996.

Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT) general manager Kwek Chee Wah said the projected
cargo handling for the port during July to December 1996 will be higher than
the 400,000 tonnes achieved during the one-year period (July 1995 to July
1996).

"Port operations took off after the second half-year (January-June 1996) of
its operations, with a 230 per cent increase in cargo handling to 295,170
tonnes as compared with the first half-year of business," he said recently.

Dry bulk cargo remains the principal cargo type handled, with 190,010 tonnes
or 64 per cent of the total volume handled during January-June.

The port also handled 99,760 tonnes of breakbulk cargo such as iron and steel,
project cargo, asbestos and hydrated lime which made up 34 per cent of total
throughput.

Mr Kwek said the port's growth reflects the users' growing confidence and the
increasing number of manufacturing industries in Perak.

He reiterated that Lumut port is not competing against Port Klang or Penang
port for cargo but will play a complementary role.

LMT is owned by Perak Development Corp and Halim Rasip Holdings Sdn Bhd, each
holding a 30 per cent stake, and Ipco International, 40 per cent. -MBT

Apply aviation's approach to safety, conference told

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Felix Chan

MARTECH '96

Speaker urges pro-active investments in accident prevention

[SINGAPORE] The aviation industry's emphasis on proactive investments in
accident prevention as opposed to reactive investments in accident cost
reduction should also be applied to shipping, delegates at the Martech '96
conference were told.

Speaking on the final day of the international conference on Maritime Safety
and Environmental Protection, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
professor E G Frankel said that emphasis should be placed on a limited number
of important maritime issues, instead of casting the "current wide net" of
largely unimportant regulations which dilute the effectiveness of existing
regulations.

Many of the existing regulations address mainly short-term effects or isolated
incidents and are more oriented to publicity and political gain than longer
term improvements in maritime safety and environmental protection, he noted.

He also noted that although the world's maritime community agreed to adopt
certain safety and environmental protection agreements, and introduced port
state control as an enforcing mechanism, the resultant enforcement is
generally quite "lax or non-existent".

"Differential enforcement of international conventions is self-degrading as
ships always gravitate to the flag of lowest enforcement," he told delegates
at the conference on Friday.

Prof Frankel stressed the need for an institution that could act like a world
maritime court with enforcement powers -something akin to a "worldwide UN
coast guard".

"Ocean shipping is an international industry and ships in international waters
should be accountable to international conventions independent of their
national laws. National sovereignty should not extend beyond national
borders," he added.

Other speakers on the final day of the conference include Lloyd's Register of
Shipping's deputy chief surveyor JM Ferguson, who spoke on bulk carrier
safety; and ABS Pacific Singapore's head of safety and environment system
certification R N Chandha, who spoke about auditing to ISM.

Joint bunker venture all set to go / KMP Coastal Oil Pte Ltd, M Zain Wakil
Penghantaran Sdn Bhd

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Yong Mei Fong

KMP Coastal Oil and M Zain Wakil Penghantaran waiting for licence

[SINGAPORE] A bunkering joint-venture between Singapore operator KMP Coastal
Oil Pte Ltd and Malaysian freight forwarding company M Zain Wakil Penghantaran
Sdn Bhd is now awaiting the final step -a licence -before starting to supply
bunkers in Port Klang.

KMP Coastal Oil, a major bunker operator in Singapore handling about one
million tonnes of bunkers a year, holds a 40 per cent stake in the
joint-venture set-up Straits Energy Sdn Bhd.

Its Port-Klang based partner holds the majority share of 60 per cent through
its subsidiary, Fasa Prestij Sdn Bhd.

According to M Zain Wakil Penghantaran director Jason Goh, the joint-venture
company has an initial paid-up capital of M$100,000 (S$56,290). He said the
new company was expected to start operations in the first quarter of next
year.

When licensed, Straits Energy will be among the small handful of about eight
approved operators in the port, of whom only about two are said to be active.

Currently, the volume of bunkers lifted in Malaysia is low, at an estimated
volume of about 200,000 tonnes last year.

Industry sources say because of customs duty imposed on bunkers for ships
plying the domestic trade, Malaysian shipping lines found it uneconomical to
lift bunkers at home and turned to Singapore for their needs.

However, the Malaysian government recently abolished bunker taxes, as part of
an incentive package to promote Port Klang as a cargo load centre. With the
tax lift-off, more shipowners are expected to take bunkers at Malaysian ports,
particularly Port Klang.

Port Klang spells out its policy on bunkering

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

By Yong Mei Fong

No intention to compete with S'pore, but it aims to cut price difference

[SINGAPORE] Despite what the industry says, Port Klang is not likely to be a
major bunker centre like Singapore, nor does it aim to compete with Singapore
on bunkering services, says M Rajasingam, general manager and chief executive
of Klang Port Authority (KPA).

"We have to develop the marine services here and our strategy is to see if we
can provide bunkers at prices which will not make ships calling here look for
another site," he told Shipping Times.

Convenience to the ship and costs were issues that the authority was tackling,
said Mr Rajasingam.

South Korea is already giving Singapore -currently the top bunkering port in
the world -a tough run for its money by offering lower bunker prices. Industry
players say Port Klang is a potential competitor too because it has been
attracting more international lines.

Disputing this, Mr Rajasingam said: "A lot of ships go to Singapore, not for
cargo handling but just for bunkering. I don't think Port Klang will be like
Singapore, a bunker centre, because of the differences in location."

Referring to the port's position next to the Straits of Malacca, he said: "The
sheltered water area is very limited. I don't think we can afford the luxury
of ships coming here just for bunkers."

Given this, the authority was in fact encouraging ships to take bunkers
outside the port limits, under the Malaysian Bunkering Procedure, which would
be issued soon, he said.

Mr Rajasingam also said that bunker prices at Port Klang -at about US$12
(S$16.90) to US$14 more per tonne than at Singapore -were a lot higher. He
hoped to narrow the difference.

"I am not even thinking of matching the price at Singapore, but to bring it
down to about US$3-US$4 more," he said.

"Though it may still be higher, it is better for the ship operator than having
to make an extra trip to another port for bunkers. This will keep the cost of
calling at Port Klang reasonable," he added.

Likewise, said Mr Rajasingam, Port Klang would also work at putting other
support services in place, such as ship chandling, supplies, water, shiprepair
and even professional services like banking and insurance.

Some of land along the port was already alloted by the government for
shipyards, he disclosed. "The idea is that we must provide services to ships
that will make the ship operator say that if I go to Port Klang, there will be
facilities that would take care of my needs."

Intermodal Asia '96 starts in Singapore today

from BUSINESS TIMES (Singapore Press Holdings Ltd), 23 Sep 96

[SINGAPORE] Intermodal Asia '96 kicks off today at the Hilton Hotel.

The three-day event will open with a special address by E G Frankel of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Department of Ocean Engineering. Prof
Frankel will speak on the changing role and technology of intermodal
transportation.

Under the topic of cross border transportation, officials from various customs
authorities will discuss ways of improving the relationship between customs
and transporters.

Another subject to be covered during the event is infrastructure development
as a basis for effective intermodal growth.

Among the speakers is Tim Bismire, an associate with Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick
of Hongkong, who will cover the subject of regional port developments.

He will review Hongkong's container terminal and river trade terminal
development. He will also discuss the competition and cooperation that exist
between Singapore and Thailand.

The event will also explore the intermodal links that exist in South-east
Asia, North-east Asia and South-west Asia.

Richard D Barclay, executive vice-president of Asian Terminals Inc, will speak
on P&O's investments in the Philippines, while P T Indonesia Bulk Terminal's
general manager, B T Kuan, will discuss developments in Indonesia.

VIETNAM: Profits low

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam has 20 foreign banks with branch offices and 4 joint venture
banks.  Their average profit is around $350,000 each, a measely
figure even if it is double that of last year.  One bank, which the
State bank of Vietnam refused to identify, still hadn't made a profit
after four years of operations.  Foreign banks had raised their
share of loans to just over 15% but most still faced problems
loaning money to local firms because of "the inadequate legal
framework in Vietnam, unaudited accounting date and ... the poor
quality of credit information and risk evaluation."

VIETNAM: Beach sleaze

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam's coastal resort town of Nha Trang has turned to sleaze to boost
its economy.  It has a thriving sex industry that is attracting
foreign tourists by the score.  Police may have been able to crack
down on beach-front gambling and to have broken the power of the
local mafia but paedophilia and drug addition remains prevalent.
Even waitresses in state-run restaurants have been known to offer
their services along with the bacon and eggs.  Much to the
amusement of foreign backpackers and the disgust of more elderly
tourists.

VIETNAM: Party cells

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

With only 82 Communist Party cells in some 1500 foreign-invested
enterprises, Hanoi obviously feels there is room for improvement.
It has announced a  policy to put party cells (its a vital
ingredient for business development', one official told incredulous
investors) in every foreign-invested enterprise, whether it be a
joint-venture or 100% foreign owned.

With Party rules clearly stating that a member's first priority is
to the Party, it is difficult to understand the Party's
general-secretary Do Muoi who commented that cells would be
`beneficial' to foreign investors.  The question foreigners want
answered is to whom the Party cells answer to, the Party or the
employer ?

VIETNAM: Short-changed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

The Golden Hanoi Hotel is no longer golden.  The very group of
Vietnamese architects that had originally approved its design have
now forced a redesign that reduces its number of rooms by a third.
Instead of the planned 150 rooms, the hotel can only have 110.
This has boosted the room cost by 40% to $168,000.  In addition,
the overall profitability of the hotel is severely reduced.

If the Hongkong investors oppose the redesign (construction is well
in hand), too bad.  The entire project would then be `handed over'
(confiscated might be a better description) to the Hanoi People's
Committee.  They would `compensate fairly' the foreign partner.
But as `fair' means one thing to the Vietnamese and another to
foreigners, it is only fair to say that the Golden Hanoi Hotel
could well be an $18.5m write-off.

LAOS: Tourists wanted

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Laos has finally awoken to the power of the tourist dollar.  To
facilitate entry, Loas will now issue visas an arrival at its
Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai borders.  This reverses a longstanding
policy that enforced strict visa controls in an effort to keep out
budget tourists.  Some 300,000 tourists visited Laos this year and
the new visa policy is expected to boost this figure to 500,000 in
1997.

The hotel and tourism industry, with $393 million in foreign
investment since 1988, is the second largest sector for investment
after electricity generation.

VIETNAM: Overcost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Cost-accounting takes on a whole new meaning in Vietnam if a government
project to upgrade Phan Thiet port is anything to go by.
Originally budgeted at $2.6m, it is now nearly three times that and
still climbing.  So drastic is the blow-out that Phan Thiet
authorities are paying contractors only 80% of their work, even if
they have completed 100% of their contract.  The Asian Development
Bank has been asked to cover the $2m projected shortfall to
complete the entire project.  But ADB has shown a marked reluctance
to get involved in a project which is simply running out of control.

MANILA: Ny listing?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam Motor Corporation (VMC), the aggressive Philippines backed
assembler of foreign auto's in Vietnam, plans to list it's shares on the
American Stock Exchange.  It is not known whether VMC is actually
making a profit (turnover since 1992 is only $90m in total on sales
of only 5500 odd cars) Bankers and fund managers believe that a
NASDAQ, Australian or Asian listing might be more appropriate for a
company from such a vulnerable market.

If VMC was able to list in America, it would mean more excitement
than success.  Smaller diversified companies with Vietnamese assets
listed in Australia and New Zealand have not fared well, and
competition in Vietnam's car market is fast heating up.

VIETNAM: Stay healthy

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hospital rates in Vietnam are going up, so much so that one could get a
heart attack just thinking about them.  The rate in a major Saigon
hospital is currently $130/day.  That includes a phone, TV and
air-conditioning.  But Swiss company, Ketone, is aiming to build
it's own hospital where patients would be charged $150/day.  The
difference in price is attributed to foreign doctors being paid
$10000 a month.  That's 300 times what a local doctor now receives.
 The message to expatriates in all these figures is that getting
sick in Vietnam will soon be too expensive to contemplate.

VIETNAM: Cloudy Windows

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Microsoft's introduction of a Vietnamese version of its Windows 95
program has resulted in somewhat cloudy results.  Because people in
the north describe technical terms differently from those in the
south there is no uniform technology for all users.  This has left
many users confused and grumbling over the product's $110 retail
price.  Apparently, Microsoft launched its Vietnamese Window
without first ironing out all the bugs.  It wanted the product in
place before launching its Vietnamese Windows 97.  Mircosoft has
got just that plus legions of disappointed users who now look
forward to the real thing.

VIETNAM: Free labor

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

In a throwback to a time when Vietnam was fighting for its survival
against the Americans and French, the country's Vice Minister of
Finance Nguyen Sinh Hung wants to see the reintroduction of
compulsory labor on "projects of public interest".  He has
calculated (possibly without including himself) that if Vietnam's pool
of 30 million labours contributed one day a year to the notion for
"patriotic duties" the country would have an extra trillion dong to
play with.  Its a nice notion, and one that has worked well for the
Burmese for many years.  But in most countries such a concept is
simply called forced labor and while it certainly enhances a
citizen's patriotism, its does little for public relations.

VIETNAM: Degenerate

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bank officials have been described as a bunch of degenerates and
incompetents by none other than the official Communist Party
newspaper Nhan Dan.  A description that fits many state employees
in Vietnam.  The paper quoted State Bank chief Cao Si Kien who bemoaned
the lack of control over domestic banking activities.  He cited
operational shortcomings (a nice way of explaining away banks that
accept deposits but can't find the money at withdrawal time),
inadequate checks on loans (assets are a bit difficult to quantify
in Vietnam), and the employment of unqualified and `degenerate'
officials (loans are sometimes given on the basis of available sex
and entertainment).

The ADB is loaning Saigon Port $30m as part of a $40m upgrade.
Work has already begun on the three year project which will see
capacity increase by 25%.  Piers will be expanded, new warehouses
built, container facilities improved, and lighting, water, and
drainage revamped.

The upgrade will give Saigon Port an annual capacity of 9 million
tons, with a further 5 million tons added by 2010.

VIETNAM: Compensation set

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon's latest compensation rates of $2000 per square metre are
not yet set in stone, but the effect is the same since the formula
was handed down by the city's People's Committee.  Developers are
not supposed to pay compensation.  The Vietnamese party is supposed
to offer a clean site.  That is the theory.  The reality is
somewhat different.  To fast-track any property project, the
foreign developer usually has to compensate the residents.  It can
now figure in $2000 psm per resident in they invariable cost
over-runs that have to be paid to the Vietnamese partner.  That
doesn't necessarily mean that the resident will receive $2000.  The
Vietnamese partner could skim off up to 80% of the compensation.

VIETNAM: Chicken feed

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Farmers in the Mekeng Delta have been growing marijuana as chicken
feed.  As least that is what they told the police who confiscated
1000 kg of cannabis plants during a recent anti-drug sweep.  Police
found it hard to swallow the chicken feed claims of the two old
ladies who had been tending the crop for the past three years.  It
is believed that the cannabis is destined for the local market
where there has been a dermatic surge in drug-taking since Vietnam's
economic reforms really took hold in the last five years.

VIETNAM: Unlucky

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

It not easy to advertise a product in Vietnam.  What is bared in the
north could be quite acceptable in the south, or vice vera.  The
latest casualty in the marketing wars is Saigon's banning of
lottery promotions whereby when a customer buys a product he
becomes eligible for a prize.  The ban hit companies as divserse as
Motorola, Shell Oil and Toshiba.  However, the ban only applies in
the south.  In the north, foreign companies are continuing to use
lucky-draws as a marketing play.  Overall, they seem to be well
received by the average Vietnamese.

VIETNAM: History Rewritten

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Not to be outdone by the famous tunnels of Cu Chi, enterprising
tourist officials in Phuoc Tuy province near Saigon have unearthed
their own "tunnels' right under the old Australian army base at Nui
Dat.  This never-before-discovered tunnel network has been lauded
by old Viet Cong as having played a major role in their war against
the south.  Never mind that the 'tunnels' don't look 30 years old,
or that they are much bigger than the average Vietnamese.  The
'tunnels' look genuine and are certainly attracting tourists.  What
the tourists don't know is that they were dug this year so that
local tourist officials could cash in on the foreign visitors.

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Foreign vegetable growers in the cool highlands town of Dalat
continue to face astronomical transport costs in getting their
produce to market.  Cathay Pacific and Vietnam Airlines have the
cargo monopoly on the Saigon to Hongkong route.  Their extortionate
rates means that its cheaper to air freight produce from Sydney to
Hongkong.

Exporting to Europe is no different.  Air freight rates are 50%
higher out of Vietnam than out of Thailand where a variety of vegetables
are grown around the northern city of Chiang Mai.

The main foreign vegetable processor in Dalat, Bio-organics, is
shifting production to vegetables that can be shipped by sea.  It
is also branching into the growing of cut flowers that can
initially be sold locally.

VIETNAM: Power drive

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vietnam is to build a new 17 billion kilowatt hours a year power plant
in its northern province of Son La.  With an expected completion by
2007 it will be three times bigger than Vietnam's existing largest hydro
project at Hoa Binh.  Official figures reveal that 50,000 people
will have to be relocated but the reservoir so created would swamp
forest and farmland in both Son La and Lai Chau provinces.  That
means that more than 100,000 people, mainly ethnic minorities,
could be affected.

The Son La project is seen as a key part of plans to boost power
output to 29 billion kwh by 2000, although total domestic
consumption could top 60 billion kwh within 10 years.  However, Son
La is set to cost in excess of $3.5 billion.  Vietnam doesn't have that
sort of money and foreign lending agencies are wary of funding
projects with so many obvious environmental concerns.

BURMA: Setting up shop in Burma

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

Angus B. Mitchell of international law firm Russin & Vecchi,
summarizes here in a percent Asian Initiates seminar in Rangoon the
sections of the economy open to foreign investment and the methods
by which a foreign investor may establish a presence in Myanmar.
For detailed information regarding any of the issues  discussed
below, please contact the author at Russin & Vecchi in Rangoon.

ESTABLISHING A PRESENCE IN MYANMAR

In 1988 the State Law and Order Restoration Council (the "SLORC")
passed the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law (the "MFIL"), which
signalled a new era in Myanmar's economic development.  The MFIL
offers attractive incentives and guarantees competitive with those
of the neighbouring nations.  Though most sectors of the economy
are open to foreign investors, there are certain reservations.

A.    Permitted Areas for Investment

Some sector of economic activity are reserved to the State by
virtue of the State Economic Enterprises Law s. 3.  There are:

    -    extraction and sale of teak;

    -    exploration, extraction and sale of petroleum, natural gas and
production of by-products;

    -    exploration, extraction and export of pearls, jade and precious
stones;

    -    breeding and production of fish and prawns in fisheries;

    -    postal and telecommunications;

    -    air and railway transport;

    -    banking and insurance services;

    -    broadcasting and television services;

    -    exploration and extraction of metals and export of same;

    -    electricity generating services; and

    -    manufacture of products relating to security and defence which
the Government has prescribed by notification.

However, even in these sectors Myanmar citizens and foreign
investors alike may apply under s. 4 for a certificate allowing
them to undertake these activities.  In practice such permission
will often only be forthcoming where the proposed activity is to be
undertaken in a joint venture with the relevant State entity.

B.    Entry Vehicles for Doing Business in Myanmar

There are three primary methods for investors to establish a
presence in Myanmar :

1.    Appoint a Business Representative;

2.    Obtain a Permit to Trade and incorporate a company/register a
branch office;

3.    Apply to invest pursuant to the Myanmar Foreign Investment Law
(the "MFIL"), and then, if doing so as a company, obtain a Permit
to Trade and incorporate a company or register a branch office in
Myanmar.

Given the size and sector restrictions applying to MFIL
investments, most foreign investors utilize #2.  It is worth noting
immediately that 100% foreign ownership and control of companies
incorporated in Myanmar is permissible, and that where the State is
to have any form of equity interest in company it must be formed
pursuant to the Special Company Act 1950.  Finally, where a joint
venture is to be through a corporate vehicle, the provisions of
Myanmar's Partnership Act will obtain.

1. Business Representatives

Registration of a Business Representative

Though there are no provisions for "Representative Offices" as the
term may be understood in other countries, there is a procedure
under which a Myanmar citizen, or a branch office or company in
Myanmar, can be registered as the official Business Representative
of a foreign entity.

Who may be a "Business Representative"

The appointment of business representatives in Myanmar is governed
by the Ministry of Trade's Registration of Business Representatives
Order (order No. 2/89, or the "Business Representatives Order").
The Business Representatives Order defines a "Business
Representative" as:

1.    "an agent engaged in accepting indents and placing orders for
goods from the supplier abroad on a commission basis or any
business representative employed to do any business transaction for
any individual or organization abroad or to represent another
person in dealings with third person."

It also includes:

1.(1)    technical assistants and business consultants employed by a
foreign manufacturer or exporter;

1.(2)    products specialists, buying agents, technicians and business
consultants employed by foreign buyers who purchase Myanmar
products;

1.(3)    individuals who represent a foreigner in foreign trade and
who render services for the benefit of such foreigner; and

1.(4)    individuals having an established office in the Union of
Myanmar and representing a foreign company or organization or an
entrepreneur to act as business representative or to engage in
consultancy services or employee recruitment but not registered as
they are not governed by any existing law.

Section 3 stipulates that a person appointed a Business
Representative must be:

    (a)    a citizen of Myanmar;

    (b)    at least 18 years of age;

    (c)    not a service personnel of any State owned entity; and

    (d)    must possess appropriate qualifications.

It is also possible to appoint companies incorporated in Myanmar,
or branch offices registered in Myanmar, as a Business
Representative, even if these companies are foreign owned.

Powers of a Business Representative

As between the Business Representative and the Principal, the scope
of the permitted powers must be clearly delineated in the
Appointment Letter, which will be registered at the Ministry of
Trade.  Any liability for the acts of a Business Representative
will be determined with reference to the terms of the appointment
letter and will be governed by common law agency principles as
codified and modified by the Contract Act 1872.

Appointment Process

An application is filed for a certificate of registration, which
certificate will be valid for one year.  With 30 days notice prior
to the expiry of the certificate an application may be made to
extend the registration for a further year.  The appointment letter
must be certified as authentic by the Myanmar embassy in the
foreign principal's country.

Registration Fee

The registration fee is based on the proposed remuneration of the
representative.  This remuneration must fall within defined
parameters.  A Business Representative may earn agency commission
in foreign exchange, in which case the registration fee is kyat
10,000 payable in foreign exchange (which would be approx. $1800.00
at the official exchange rate of 5.75 kyat/ 1$).

Alternatively the Business Representative may earn a salary, in
which case registration fees are payable in local currency as
follows:

            Category            Registration Fee        Extension Fee

(1)    monthly salary of US$1,000    kyats 10,000            kyats 5,000
        and above

(2)   monthly salary of US$501        kyats 5,000            kyats 2,500
        to US$1,000

(3)   monthly salary of US$100        kyats 2,500            kyats 1,000
        to US$500

For reference the official exchange rate is pegged to the Special
Drawing Right (SDR) and the rate is currently approximately kyat
5.75 = $1US.  However, the market exchange rate, which can now be
legally obtained at a recognized new Exchange Centre, is about kyat
130 = $1US, so that for example the registration fee of kyat 2500
would cost only $20.

When is a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar necessary ?

Though  the definition of "business representative" noted above
gives some indication of the scope of activities contemplated for
Business Representatives, the point at which a company must
establish a more formal corporate presence in Myanmar remains
ill-defined.  The trigger appears to be when a company is "doing
business" in country.

2. Obtaining a Permit to Trade only

Section 27A of the Myanmar Companies Act requires that requires
that foreign companies obtain a Permit to Trade.  Formerly such
Permits were issued by the Ministry of Trade, whereas now they are
issued by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic
Development.

An application for a Permit must be in the prescribed form and will
require certain information regarding the investor and the
investment.  The Capital Structure Committee will consider
applications, and will stipulate a minimum capitalization amount.
There are certain prescribed minimum amounts, which are outlined
below for the 5 categories of Permits to Trade, but in some cases
the CSC may stipulate a higher amount in part based on
consideration of the company's expected expenditures during the
first year of operations.  One half of the stipulated amount must
be brought into the country before the Permit will be issued, and
the balance must follow within one year.

Following are the categories:

    i.     Manufacturing             kyat 1,000,000

    ii.    Trading                   kyat 500,000

    iii.   Services                  kyat 300,000

    iv.    Hotel/Tourism             kyat 300,000

    v.     Banking/Finance/Insurance kyat 300,000

As the official exchange rate is approximately kyat 5.75 - US$1 the
effect is that, for example, a requirement to import 300,000 will
actually require that the investor bring in roughly $53,000.  These
funds will be transferred into the investors foreign currency
account, and can be withdrawn in foreign currency equivalent
Foreign Exchange Certificates ("FEC's") to meet local expenses.  Up
to 75% can then be used to open an LC and thus in effect to bring
capital :in kind".

It is important to note that the company will be restricted to
activities which fall within the purview of its Permit to Trade
category, and that this Permit to Trade category must gybe with
stated objects of incorporation of the company.  Whereas formerly
companies would adopt "kitchen sink" objects clauses which
contemplated every conceivable manner of activity, now companies
are restricted to a list of objects issued by the Registrar of
Companies for companies in the relevant category of Permit to
Trade.  Companies must choose a limited number of the objects
clauses on this official list.

Additionally, whereas previously the categories of Permit to Trade
were tiered and inclusive, such that a manufacturing company could
engage in trading and services, and a trading company could engage
in services, now each category of Permit to Trade is distinct.  For
example, a manufacturing company may not engage in trading or
services, but must instead incorporate a distinct company and
obtain a distinct Permit to Trade for that purpose.  However,
companies may engage in what might be termed "downstream or
upstream" operations directly related to the activities
contemplated in their Permit.  Thus a manufacturing company could
engage in the retail sale of its own products and could import the
raw materials necessary for production.  That company could not,
however, participate in trading of unrelated goods.

Please note that in many sectors the economy the investor will need
to submit a licence fro the relevant Ministry as part of the Permit
to Trade application.

Once the Permit to Trade has been issued the investor can proceed
with the incorporation of a company or registration of a branch
office.  These application must again be in the prescribed form,
and require information on the shareholders, directors etc.

3. The MFIL

Investment under the MFIL always merits consideration because of
the generous tax and export/import incentives, and the explicit
guarantees regarding repatriation and nationalization, for which
MFIL investors are eligible.  However, there are certain listed
areas of permitted investment, certain minimum thresholds for MEIL
investors and MFIL has certain objectives to be considered when
assessing an application, including:

    - promotion and expansion of exports

    - exploitation of natural resources which require heavy investment

    - acquisition of high technology

    - supporting and assisting production and services requiring high
capital

    - opening up of more employment opportunities

    - development of works which would save energy consumption

    - regional development

In the results trading companies, for example, will not generally
be eligible for MFIL incentives.  By law it is never mandatory to
invest under the MFIL, but as a matter of policy companies
investing in certain sector of the economy might be asked to submit
the comprehensive MFIL proposals even if they do not want the
incentives that the MFIL offers.  It would be a rare case however
where an eligible company did not want to avail itself of the
MFIL's benefits.

Under the MFIL, foreign investment can occur in the form of 100%
foreign-owned venture, or in a joint venture with a Burmese entity
or individual.  If wholly foreign owner the investment can occur in
the form of a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a limited
company; if a joint venture, at least 35% of the joint venture
equity capital must be foreign capital.

MFIL applications require detailed information which must be
complied and submitted in a prescribed form.  Information required
includes information as to the investment participants (including
bank references and other information as to financial standing),
the investment structure, the magnitude, nature, division and
timing of capital contributions, the input requirements (foreign
exchange, personnel, power, etc.) and output projections for the
business, and any draft agreements (such as leases, contracts with
relevant Ministries, etc.) relating to  the project.

MFIL applications will be vetted and forwarded to the Myanmar
Investment Commission (the MIC") for review.  The MIC's members
include all Ministers whose portfolio's could be said to related to
commerce, industry to commerce, industry or finance.  When the MIC
has issued its recommendation regarding the application it will
forward it to the Cabinet for final consideration.  This
requirement that the powerful Cabinet explicitly consider and issue
its approval for issuance of an MFIL Permit is an important
distinction from certain other regional nations lacking such a
unitary central authority.  Such a "seal of approval" can greatly
expedite future dealings with government officials, provided always
that the matter at issue was explicitly contemplated in the MFIL
application materials.

When an MFIL Permit is granted the investor may then establish a
corporate presence in Myanmar pursuant to the steps noted above in
#2 if this is the chosen investment vehicle.

VIETNAM: Success is a mind's game

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

FT : - For a country that for decades learned more from the
text-books of Marx than the market economy, Vietnam is doing
remarkably well.

Group domestic product growth is around 8 per cent, mainly on the
back of rapid growth in construction, increased exports and
industrial growth.  Saigon, the country's engine of growth, grew by
almost 15 per cent, although there are signs that Hanoi and the
north is catching up.

"The main thing is staying on course in terms of macro-economic
management," says Bradley Babson, resident representative of the
World Bank.

But despite the past four years of successes, Vietnam has reached
an economic crossroads.  Inflation, which in 1988 raged at about
300 per cent, was brought down to 5.2 per cent by 1993.

However, consumer prices have increased ominously and economists
fear that the indicator could climb back up to alarming levels on
the back of rapid economic growth unless the trend is checked.

Although domestic savings accounted for some 17 per cent of growth
this year, far above the paltry 7.4 per cent recorded in 1990,
economists say that this is still too far below average levels in
the region and compares unfavourably to that of China, where the
rate is about 35 per cent.

Although the fruits of doi moi are evident in the main cities -
where cars are becoming more common and many residents have been
busily converting their homes into mini-hotels or small shops - the
countryside lags far behind.  Since agriculture employs more than
70 per cent of the workforce and accounts for more than 50 per cent
of total export volume, this could act as a drag on growth.

However, the economists sound greatest alarm over investment
inflows, which, though increasing, will not be enough to sustain
industrialisation.

The World Bank, normally upbeat on Vietnam, has in its latest
report tempered its praise with a warning that Vietnam must
demonstrate more enthusiasm for developing the nascent private
sector if growth is to be sustained.

"Despite the success of state enterprise-led industrialisation
since 1991, a strategy based on developing large, capital-intensive
state enterprises, protected from foreign and domestic private
competition and concentrated in selected `strategic' sectors, would
not deliver the kind of industrialisation Vietnam needs," said the
World Bank report.

Vietnam's private sector is restricted to small-scale enterprises
such as food processing and the manufacturing of garments and some
consumer goods.  Vietnamese private businessmen complain of an
unequal playing field on which they are forced to compete with
privileged state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

"The state sector has a monopoly of many high profit businesses
like telecoms, real estate, export and import but the private
sector is not allowed to take charge of them," says Bui Huy Hung,
president of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank, one of a handful
of share holding banks.

"This is the biggest obstacle to the transition to the market
economy."

Despite a vigorous campaign by Hanoi that has cut the number of
SOEs to 6,000 from 12,5000 since 1990, Hanoi appears set on
maintaining the state sector's dominance of key sectors of the
economy.  Foreign economists point out that most of the SOEs closed
down as part of the down-sizing were small, town-based units in the
provinces, with little economic clout, even collectively.

In mid-1994, Hanoi formed 14 conglomerates in sectors such as
electricity, cement, textiles and rubber.  "The idea is to increase
competition and to form more commercial establishments," says Phan
Van Tiem, chairman of the government's State Enterprise Reform
Committee, admitting that Vietnamese policy makers are using the
chaebol of South Korea as one model.

Foreign economists and the World Bank suspect that the creation of
such conglomerates may be just another way of strengthening SOE
control over the economy, saying that rubber scarcely qualifies as
a strategic industry.

"They cannot do this with the state sector as the centre of
gravity," says one foreign economist.

Economists see an urgent need to mobilise domestic savings -
estimated at about $2bn - and channel them into the banking system.
 Progress on this has been slow due to traditional mistrust of
banks and despite the launch this year of a series of domestic
treasury bill auctions ultimately aimed at the retail market.

In the meantime, Vietnam hopes to meet some of its spending needs
by issuing government bonds internationally.  Hanoi is keen to move
as fast as possible with huge sums needed for infrastructure,
education and healthcare.

"Vietnam has ambitious targets and the danger is that they going to
spend too much too quickly, and that could affect inflation and the
balance of payments," said a foreign economist in Hanoi.

VIETNAM: $1bn for flat steel mill

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Vietnam's attempts to aggressively recruit foreign companies to build
steel mills within its borders are about to pay off in a big way.
Korea's Posco and Daewoo are finalising plans to build Vietnam first
flat-product steel mill, which could cost as much as $1 billion.

"We are discussing this project with Daewoo and VSG," Sujin Oh,
Posco's chief representative in Hanoi said.  "We have finished the
pre-feasibility study."

The large infrastructual needs expected to be associated with the
project are causing headaches in determining its location.  At
least three sites are under consideration, two in central Vietnam
and one in the north.  The Vietnamese are again pushing for Duang
Quat as a steel mill fits in well with their ideas of
industrialising central Vietnam.  Costs for infrastructure alone,
including a deep-see port that could accommodate ships of at least
40,000 dead-weight tonnes and adequate electricity and roads, are
likely to be about US$200 million.

"We assume the Vietnamese government will provide the
infrastructure," he said.  The Vietnamese are assuming that the
foreigners will pay for it.

Four joint ventures between Vietnam Steel Corporation and foreign
partners have come on line within the last 18 months with a total
capacity of more than 700,000 tonnes.  This is still short of
Daewoo's annual projections for Vietnam of 3 million tons by 2000.

All of these mills are producing construction steel, which is used
primarily for reinforcing buildings.

Vietnam at present has no mills producing flat steel, which is used
in products such as cars, refrigerators and washing machines.  The
Korean flat steel mill will be a welcome part of the national
strategy that Vietnam is encouraging in its shift to heavy
manufacturing.

VIETNAM: $650m for Vung Tau port

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

In the largest build-operate-transfer deal ever signed in Vietnam, a
Taiwanese led consortium  is to put up to $650m into turning Vung
Tau into the nation's leading container port.  The deal, involving
Taiwan's Evergreen, Malaysia's MMC Ports, and Singapore's Tredia
Resources, is the largest infrastructure investment on record.
Under the BOT contract the consortium will run the port for 40
years before handing it back to the government.

A first phase is expected to go into operation within two years and
with 15 years the project will have the capacity to handle 45
million tonnes of cargo annually.

Vietnam Marine Corporation, a state-owned entity, will initially
hold a 5 per cent stake in the project but as the expansion starts
to make money it will buy shares from its foreign partners to
increase this to up to 20 per cent.

The Vung Tau upgrade will complement the $40m revamp of Saigon
Port.  The ADB funded project will see capacity there expanded by
25% by 1998.

With annual trade growing at 30% Vietnam's ports are woefully inadequate
to handle it.  They could become completely congested within two
years as new infrastructure development fails to keep pace with
trade.

Vietnam has a BOT law to encourage infrastructure improvements but
few companies have attempted this form of investment because of
limited guarantees on foreign exchange and pricing of services.

Cambodia downsizes contract

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

Cambodia has a unique interpretation of downsizing, the American
term for reducing employees.  Cambodia downsizes entire contracts.
Two years ago it threw out two Thai airlines and signed with the
Malaysians for Royal Air Cambodge.  A year ago Phnom Penh signed a
billion dollar deal with Malaysian company YTL to turn Angkor Wat
into a major tourist attraction.  Now, the land that had been
awarded to YTL (1095 hectares) has been cut in half and seven new
companies have been called in to bid on its development.

Aspara, the agency charged with overseeing protection and
management of the temples, has asked two local companies and five
foreign firms including France's Dumen GTM Cambodge, and Korea's
Daewoo.  YTL was not even on the list.

The rebidding for the Angkor Wat complex reveals the infighting
between Tourism Minister Veng Sereyvuth who supported YTL, and
State Minister Van Moulyvann who leads Aspara.  The latter had been
particularly critical of YTL's proposals for a light-and-sound
show, while conservationists are worried that the hotels will be
built on archaeologically protected land.

For his part Veng Sereyvuth defended YTL saying that it had
produced a professional plan that would protect the environment and
had commissioned a study showing the light-and-sound show would not
damage the temples.

The real question that investors are asking on their Cambodian
deals is whether a Cambodian contracts is worth the paper it is
written on.  The YTL downsizing is an obvious example that its not.

BURMA: $7 billion despite pressure

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

The generals in Burma have reason to feel optimistic.  Despite
increasing pressure for foreigners to disinvest and continuing
American calls for sanctions, total approved investment in Burma
should reach $7 billion by year's end.  All is from the private
sector with oil and gas attracting the most investment with 25
projects worth $1.44 billion.

Since 1988 when SLORC took over the government no loans had been
forthcoming from international financial institutions such as the
World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian
Development Bank (ADB).

The lack of foreign aid and soft loans does restrict development,
says David Abel, the country's Minister for Economic Development.
But he still believes that private investment will continue to
blossom with another $1.5 billion committed by March 1997.

Whereas Abel believes that Burma, which is still a member of the
governing bodies of the WB, ADB and IMF, faces only political
obstacles rather than "technical" ones for the resumption of loans.
 An ADB official said the inadequacy of economic reforms in Burma
and the government's foreign exchange policy were the main
stumbling blocks.

American companies remain the leading investors in Burma with more
than $250m committed so far on 15 projects.  Some 20 countries have
so far invested $4.13 billion in 176 projects, with two European
nations among the top three investors.

Britain tops the list with $1.003 billion invested, followed by
Singapore ($896 million) and France ($465 million).

VIETNAM: British may get a chance

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

British construction firm John Liang International may yet get the
chance to build Hanoi's new international airport.  Four years ago
it had submitted a bid for a new, smaller passenger terminal after
undertaking a privately financed feasibility study that assessed
passenger growth and traffic forecasts.  The British firm, despite
strong backing from London, lost the Hanoi contract to a Japanese
construction group and work on the first phase of the Hanoi
rebuilding scheme, the construction of a new international
passenger terminal, has just begun.

The Vietnamese, never slow to use foreign cash to achieve their own
goals, have decided that the new Hanoi airport would serve both
civilian and military aircraft.  Japanese aid is given under strict
civilian guidelines and is specifically prohibited from being used
to assist military - related projects.  This means that the
Japanese will most likely withdraw from the project altogether.  If
that happens, the most likely beneficiary will be John Liang
International that still has the original ,50m in government aid
that was used to back its earlier bid.  Talks have been opened and
the Vietnamese are receptive to a British takeover should the
Japanese falter.

The Hanoi revamp, plus a similar one in Saigon, are the
cornerstones of a massive upgrading scheme.  The country's civil
aviation department has proposed spending $5 billion to $8 billion
during the next 15 years to improve 50 airports throughout the
country.

An IATA report has predicted that air traffic in Vietnam would grow from
1.2 million passengers in 1993 to 3.9 million in 2000 and 17.4
million by 2010.

VIETNAM: Individual tax in VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

David King is the resident representative in Vietnam of accountancy firm
Pannell Kerr Foster.  He clarifies here the tax regulations that
foreign individuals face when they take up residence in Vietnam.

A recent crackdown on foreign representative offices by the tax
department has caused some confusion among foreign workers about
what taxes they should be paying and who they should pay them to.

The Hanoi People's Committee has sent a memo to all foreign
representative offices in the city saying that its External
Economic Department is now charged with collecting the income tax
of Vietnamese and foreigners in representatives offices.  This
means that staff in these offices must pay their salary tax to the
People's Committee instead of the tax department.

The tax department is looking at ways to increase its effectiveness
in tax collections and, in a sense, the People's Committee has been
sub-contracted to collect the taxes for which it receives a small
commission.

The People's Committee is taking a common sense approach to
collecting the taxes and there now appears to be an unofficial
amnesty for foreign representative offices to lodge their income
declarations.  However, if a representative office in audited and
found to be neglecting its tax payments, the tax office is unlikely
to show any leniency.

From the People's Committee's perspective the chief representative
must be a resident in Vietnam, which raises two issues.

One is the tax perspective.  If you are nominated as chief
representative, the People's Committee tax collection team
considers that you are a resident and you should be paying tax on
your worldwide income at Vietnamese tax rates.

There are three tax levels for foreign workers.  According to the
Tax Act a foreigner working in Vietnam for less than 30 days over
any consecutive 12-month period pays no tax on his or her income.

The difference between Vietnam and other countries is that the
12-month period does not necessarily coincide with Vietnam's tax
year, which is from January to December.

The second tax scale applies to a foreigner working in Vietnam for
more than 30 days and less than 183 days over a consecutive
12-month period.

If you fit into this group you are supposed to pay tax at a flat
rate of 10 per cent on Vietnam-sourced income.

The third rate is for a fully-fledged resident in the country for
any period over 183 days.  This is the criteria under which the
chief representative falls and is taxed on his worldwide salary and
wages income.

The chief representative should be paying tax at this third rate
because he should be a permanent employee of an office in Vietnam.

There is no difference between paying tax to the People's Committee
and the tax department.  The tax payer fills in the same form and
receives the same receipt - the payment simply goes to a different
address.

The People's Committee issues an assessment which says how much
each employee must pay per month.  The amount is paid and a receipt
is issued.

Confusion in paying taxes for foreign workers arises because
payments must be made monthly and many foreigners are in Vietnam -
on and off - for short periods.  Many workers are uncertain how
long they will remain in the country, making it difficult to assess
which tax level they fall under and how much they should pay.

A preferable tax system would not categorise tax payers at the
beginning of their work period - they would be categorised over the
long term.  Monthly tax would be paid at a marginal rate then fully
reconciled in the annual return.

BURMA: Is SLORC on a slide ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

In a country that is chronically short of telephones Burma's SLORC
is selling its citizens mobile phones - 4000 of them at $4000 each.
 But as the phones have to be purchased in dollars, the $16m

generated from the sale drained the local black market of dollars
and seriously undermined the value of the kyat.  The local currency
lost a quarter of its value in this odd attempt to boost government
coffers.  The attempted solution to one problem led to potentially
more serious problems elsewhere.

But mobile phones are only part of the story.  They are not the
sole reason for the fall in the kyat, and nor is the exchange rate
the only difficulty confronting  SLORC.

Newspaper headlines have been dominated by talk of rising political
tensions, increasing dissent among opposition groups and
international criticism of Rangoon's human rights record, and SLORC
faces a whole range of worsening economic problems.  Its attempts
to tackle these problems threaten to make matters worse before they
get better.  And the economic woes have great potential to add to
the discontent.

Inflation is rising, a trend that can only worsen as the currency
depreciates.  Dollars are becoming harder to find because they are
needed for imports, while dollar-earning exports face numerous
obstacles.  The trade balance is in deficit.

Investment, which ought to offer a major means of escape from this
vicious cycle, is also looking grim, with a growing number of
foreign firms deferring projects or withdrawing from the country
because of political controversy.

SLORC's hopes of raising foreign exchange through its Visit Burma
Year campaign have been largely dashed because of the dissidents'
campaign against the promotion, and because some tourists are
afraid of trouble.

"SLORC is tying itself up with economic problems," said one Asian
diplomat.

Most businessmen expect the kyat to hover around 180 kyat to the
dollar until the end of the year.  This compares to its movement
last year between 100 and 110 kyat on the unofficial market.  The
official exchange rate is 5.6 kyat to the dollar.

One of the reasons for the economic concerns is the deteriorating
political situation.  Confrontations between SLORC and opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the arrests in May of 262 of Mrs Suu
Kyi's National League for Democracy members for "questioning" are
the most visible troubles.

This incident, together with the death of James Leander Nichol, the
former honorary counsel for Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Switzerland, has prompted some Scandinavian countries and the
United States to seriously consider economic sanctions against
Rangoon.

Also contributing to the worries are rumours of the deteriorating
health of the country's main strongman, Ne Win, according to
analysts in Rangoon.

Suu Kyi has been outspoken in calling for the suspension of
overseas aid and for a boycott of the government's Visit Myanmar
Year 1996 campaign.  This has been "psychologically effective"
among international communications and is frustrating SLORC, said
one Burmese businessmen.

"The investment climate is now looking grim," said another observer.

"People are made to feel insecure by such political confrontation,"
said a third.

Their dissatisfaction could increase as the cost of living
increases.  Inflation has almost doubled, form 24 percent last year
to 40 percent at present.

As the kyat sinks, the cost of imports rises.  About 80 percent of
Burma's consumer products and construction materials are imported,
while exports include beans, pulses, low quality rice and raw
materials.

To generate more revenue for the government, SLORC has quietly
informed businessmen it has changed the formula for calculating the
tax it charges on imports and exports.

It has created a new official exchange rate to be used exclusively
for calculating import and export duties.  The price of imports and
exports is now calculated at 10 kyat per dollar instead of the 5.6
kyat official rate it sets for actual transactions.

This could have meant a 20-fold leap in tax payments, but SLORC at
the same time slashed the duties payable on imports and exports
from 100 percent to 10 percent.  The result is that the duty rate
has doubled, with SLORC hoping its revenues will increase by
approximately 50 percent.

The new formula has increased the price of imported consumer
products by 20-30 percent, according to Sriwat Suwarn, the Thai
Minister Counsellor for Commercial Affairs in Rangoon.

"Poor people and low-ranking civil servants are suffering most," he
said.

The salaries of government officials range from 1,000 kyat per
month to 2,500 kyat for those at the director general level.

Many local businessmen disagree with the new plan but say there is
no one to turn to with their complaints.

Mr Sriwat predicted SLORC would be forced to scrap the new formula
because it is unworkable and will cause widespread discontent.

The military government is aware of the rising cost of products and
early this year opened a new Government Employees Bank to help
civil servants.  The bank grants interest-free loans equal to 10
times monthly salaries so officials can keep pace with the rising
cost of living.

SLORC knows the public servants will have difficulties repaying the
loans, whose first repayments are due next month, so a 60 percent
salary increase is expected to be announced in the new few weeks,
according to one Burmese source.

"The 60 percent increase is to help them repay the money they
borrow," he said.

Unfortunately, traders have already raised their prices as they
know civil servants have more money to spend as a result of the
loans.  Rumours of a new salary hike will only add to the
escalating prices, said the source.

Thein Tun, the chairman of Pepsi-Cola Products Myanmar Co, places
the economic blame elsewhere.  He said export problems are caused
by port congestion, but this should ease in two years time when new
facilities are in place.

"There are 47 ships waiting to berth but we cannot export our
commodities," he said.

To ease the port congestion, the government has recently signed an
agreement with three Singaporean companies - C & P Holding,
Sinmardev International and Myanmar Integrated Port Service - to
build wharves and other facilities at a new port in Thilawa, about
30 kilometres from the capital.

Construction is expected to be completed in two years.

But Mr Sriwat of the Thai Embassy said this would not be enough.
The government should seriously consider measures to attract
foreign investment in manufacturing industries as the value-added
production would help reduce imports and boost exports.

Added investment would break the vicious cycle of devaluation and
inflation, but foreign confidence in Burma is at a new low.

The recent withdrawal of European brewers Heineken and Carlsberg,
and cancellations by a group of Japanese tourists planning to visit
Burma are just some examples of the multinational pressure mounting
on the junta.

Threats from the US to sanction Burma would not have a major impact
on the country because it is not a major trade partner of SLORC,
said one Burmese trader.

But it would cost the jobs of 40,000 Burmese who work in textile
factories serving the American market, he added.

VIETNAM: Hanoi admits foreigners are sceptical

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In a somewhat refreshing comment, a high level official in Vietnam's
Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), vice-minister Nguyen
Nhac, has admitted that despite a decade of opening up, foreign
investors are still sceptical of the government's policies.

This month should see the amendment for the third time of Vietnam's
Foreign Investment Law.  It is supposed to focus on simplification
of post-licence procedures, such as land use permits, construction
permits and taxation, and other challenges which foreign investors
are encountering that, presumably, covers things such as the state
theft of 40 containers of mining equipment from Westralian Sands
earlier this year.

Under the revamped investment law investors will get permits for
land use and construction in one month.  The government has
facilitated licence procedures since the merger of a licensing body
(State Committee for Cooperation and Investment) and a planning
agency (State Planning Committee) last year creating a theoretical
one-stop service at the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI).

But investors are still struggling in some areas of investment and
in some parts of the country, Nhac said.  "In some areas MPI works,
but in others there are still problems.  That's why we're
determined to perfect our legal framework and improve the
environment including infrastructure.  In certain areas, investment
is falling, such as in real estate and office/hotel projects.  But
we see a good trend: over 80% of the projects are manufacturing
industries, which is in line with our needs."

MPI is considering more incentives or facilities for industrial
estate development.  "We try to provide facilities, the lowest land
rents of fees, fewer taxes and longer tax exemptions," he said.

What Nhac would do well to consider is a concerted effort to
prevent foreign investors from being ripped off at the slightest
excuse.  Over-charging and corruption is one thing.  That can be
managed.  But orchestrated state theft is quite another.  There is
far too much of both at a time when Vietnam is facing serious regional
competition for the investment dollar.

VIETNAM: Following in thou footsteps

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

As Westralian Sands executives fled their Ha Tinh ilmenite mine
with little more than the shirts on their backs, and leaving behind
40 containers of sophisticated mining equipment that was
subsequently stolen by provincial authorities, another Australian
company was digging in for the long term.

Perth based Golden Tiger Resources is one of the few publicly
listed firms in Australia to focus entirely on Vietnam.  "Our company is
now completely set up to become a mining company in Vietnam,"
Golden Tiger Resources managing director Rupert Crowe said.  "It is
going to take a while, but we have confidence that there is a lot
to be found there."

Two of Golden Tiger's Vietnam's projects are 50-50 joint ventures with
the Canadian mining company Teck Corp.  Golden Tiger has three
exploration programmes under way in Vietnam.  Two are joint ventures
with Teck to search for gold, and the other is a lead-zinc project.

With reference to Hanoi's theft of 40 containers of mining
equipment, Crowe said, "Obviously, there are concerns about those
sort of problems.  But our relationship with the Vietnamese is very
good." Westralian said much the same thing, right up until the
police put a padlock on their mine.

VIETNAM: Sponsorship opportunities abound

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

In Indochina, there are great opportunities for sponsorship, but a
lot of thought must be given to the realities of each country
before events are planned, according to Bates Vietnam chairman
David Bell.

Mr Bell said it is believed that consumer involvement in events is
stronger in the developing markets of Indochina because consumers
have been isolated from international-style events for a long time.

"In the case of Vietnam, it's about 20 years.  therefore, virtually
anything new is exciting," said Mr Bell.

However, because of the rigid system of government control in some
countries, it does not mean that all sponsorships will
automatically be a success.

In Vietnam, there is a three-station TV Choice in Saigon and Hanoi,
and the station calculates its rate on time segments rather than
programming.

"TV cost efficiency is generally good.  However, one of the major
problems is the inability of the TV Stations to plan their
programming in advance and their likelihood to change," said Mr
Bell.

"Viewers may get used to a foreign entertainment programme being on
at a certain time each week, but suddenly it will change and much
viewership is lost."

In Burma, only the state-run TV Station gives national coverage and
reaches a total audience of around three to four million viewers.
A peak time 30-second spot goes for $585, so for high rating
programmes, Myanmar TV is very economical.

According to Mr Bell, sponsorship is not well developed in
Cambodia, but it is possible to do it.  He explained that the Thai
station, TV5, is easier to deal with and has better coverage - with
spillover into Cambodia.  The Thais are also more clued up about
sponsorship.  However, it is more expensive for a peak time spot,
and no reliable research is used to evaluate performance.

All these three countries have marked differences in cultural
values.  They have different religions and languages, though there
are some common languages such as English, Chinese, French and Thai.

"The trend for marketing events in these countries is to use local
languages," said Mr Bell.

"Nevertheless, some important similarities, like sport, music,
entertainment programmes and popular sciences, are such that
sponsorship and event marketing can use them for regional
activities that can reach similar groups across differing cultures.

"Though there are a lot of problems we have to face in organising
sponsorships and event marketing in these markets, we should try
new things and have patience with the authorities and other
logistical problems."

LAOS: Lao runaround on telecom deal

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

Doing business in Indochina is never easy but the runaround given
to Thailand's Shinawatra telecoms group was more frustrating than
most.  Three times it flew its executives and media reps into
Vientiane in anticipation of the contract signing.  The first
postponement was due to only a Lao version of the contract being
available.  The Lao's inexplicably gave as their reason for the
delay a requirement for an English version of the contract.

The second postponement was due to the arrival in Vientiane of
Thailand's Prime Minister which gave Lao government officials a
much better excuse to be unavailable.  The third postponement
underlined the reasons for the first delay.  Vientiane had been
offered a better deal by M Group, another Thai telecom giant which
has a high profile in Laotian telecommunications.

M Group has won a licence from the Lao government to operate a
gigantic broad-casting satellite project, L-Star.  The country's
first satellite will be put into orbit in December next year and
will cover all of Asia.

Shinawatra operates Thaicom satellites of similar coverage and
capacity.  The top bosses at both groups are widely known to have
had a difficult relationship for the past few years.  Suradet
Mukyangkoon, a highly-placed source in the Lao government said the
postponements were caused merely by a Thai company wishing to
participate in the telecom projects.

"The company has approached the government and made attractive
offers many times while Shinawatra was engaged in negotiating to
work out the new deal," said the government source, without naming
the contender.

The message to investors is clear.  If negotiating in Indochina in
good faith, you can bet on it that the other side isn't.  If the
other side comes up with a litany of excuses to avoid signing a
contract, look over your shoulder.  You will probably find the
competition using every trick in the book to get you out of the
picture.

LAOS: Urban growth, rural poverty

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane, AP:

Ten years after embracing capitalist-style reforms and cautiously
opening its doors, this impoverished communist nation in the heart
of a dynamic Southeast Asia is beginning to register economic
growth.

But while more urban dwellers can buy cars and television sets,
relatively little has been done to fight malnutrition, disease and
illiteracy in the valleys and hills where most Laotians live.

"The growth is not distributed equally.  The challenge this country
is facing is a widening gap between city and country, the rich and
the poor," says Jan Mattsson, head of UN Development Programme in
Laos.

While sleepy by the standards of most Asian capitals, Vientiane is
revving up.  Its markets are full, new restaurants and hotels are
opening, and banks from neighbouring, wildly capitalistic Thailand
dominate the city's main Avenue of a Million Elephants.

But by World Bank estimates, half of Lao's 4.6 million people still
fall below a poverty line set at $12 of income or goods a month.
In rural areas, most are subsistence farmers who cannot participate
in a market economy and whose lives are mirrored in the bleak
overall statistics.

Average life expectancy is 51 years.  More than one-third of adults
are illiterate.  Electricity reaches only 15 percent of the
population.  Nearly half the children under 5 years suffer stunted
growth from chronic malnutrition.

Officials argue that a rich-poor gap is inevitable when centralised
control is loosened in favour of the free market.  But to this, say
analysts, is added a deeply rooted disregard for the countryside by
Vientiane's elite - colonial, royalist or today's mix of Marxist
power brokers,  old families and the newly rich.

"When you open up the country, the black beast emerges,: said
Thongphachanh Sonnasinh, a senior planning official.  "But we are
trying to decentralise the resources we get from outside."

At its sixth congress in last March, the 78,000-member Communist
Party focused on the issues of equality and how quickly it should
embrace the outside world.

Underlying the debate are apparent fears that the economic gap
could bring political instability and that wide open doors could
lead to loss of both party control and national sovereignty.

Laos is certainly vulnerable.  It is land-locked, heavily dependent
on some $200 million in foreign aid each year and surrounded by
economically aggressive Thailand, Vietnam and China.  It has little
to offer foreign investors but its natural resources - chiefly,
minerals, hydroelectric potential and rapidly diminishing forests.

The world's least populated communist state admits controlling the
more than 500 foreign investors already here is difficult.  Laos
will even be hard pressed to find qualified officials to staff the
200-plus annual meetings held by the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which it joins next year.

"While not completely reversing course, the party appears to have
chosen to emphasize the perceived dangers stemming from the
open-door policy, including social problems and a loss of economic
control," says Ray Eaton, an Australian businessman with extensive
contacts in Indochina.

The liberalising "New Economic Mechanism", introduced in 1986, has
yielded some benefits, and Laos is one of the few least developed
countries to enjoy growth.

Despite an inflation rate of nearly 20 percent and flooding that
displaced 10 percent of the population, Laos still managed a 7.1
percent economic growth rate last year.

Since 1988, foreigners have invested $5 billion, three-quarters of
this going into hydroelectric power projects that economists say
could help pull Laos out of poverty over the decade.

"We want to grow faster and join the developed community, but our
conditions are not yet ready," said Mr Thongphachanh in an
interview.  "We now take one step forward, one step back.  We are
on the platform, but don't know when the launch will take place."

Despite such caution and anxiety - voiced by almost every official
in Laos - odds are great the country will inevitably be drawn into
the one of the world's fastest growing regions.

All-weather roads linking Laos to China and Vietnam are being
rapidly constructed, while agreement was recently reached to build
a second bridge across the Mekong River to Thailand.  Some 43,000
tourists visited the country last year, up from almost zero a few
years earlier.

Membership in the seven-nation ASEAN will force Laos to lower
trade, immigration and other barriers.  The country may even enter
cyberspace: One foreign company is trying to introduce the hitherto
illegal Internet.

VEITNAM: Environment loses in race for economic growth

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bien Hoa:

More than two decades after the Americans decimated Vietnam's tropical
forests and farmland with defoliants and bombing, the country's
ecosystem is under attack again, this time from unharnessed
economic growth.

Flushed with the success of its drive to revamp an economy scarred
by years of war and isolation, Vietnam's communist leadership is now
planning a hell-for-leather dash to become an industrialised nation.

"If the government doesn't smarten up its act on the environment,
it will have a Bangkok or Jakarta on its hands by the end of the
century," said one Western aid worker.  "Alarm bells are ringing
and the government is listening with only half an ear."

Vietnam says pollution has not yet become a serious problem.  But a
casual observer in the southern boom town of old Saigon, might
disagree.

Long lines of trucks belching filthy emissions clog the main
arteries into the city, where the tinkle of bicycle bells has long
been drowned out by the roar of cars and motorbikes.

Cars are still somewhat of a novelty in what remains one of the
world's poorest nations, but annual sales are expected to grow
almost six-fold between now and the end of the century to 60,000
units.  That will put a major strain on the country's road system,
one of the most primitive in Asia.

Down at the Saigon River, which runs through the heart of the city,
scavengers rummage through stinking mounds of garbage.  Others poke
about in the inky water, where huge islands of debris float along
with dead rats and human faeces.

About 30 kilometres to the northeast, the ageing Bien Hoa 1
industrial park spews mountains of untreated waste into the Dong
Nai River, a tributary of the river that flows through Saigon and
provides 90 percent of its drinking water.

The Dong Nai Paper Company deposits some 3,000 tonnes of untreated
caustic soda into the Dong Nia River every year.  Hoan, general
director of the company, says fishermen have long deserted the
stretch of river by his plant.

"This is an old factory so we don't have a chemical recovery
system," he said.  "The chemicals just go into the river."

However, the government is starting to listen to the warnings of
environmentalists, even if it is less than keen to make the
financial investment needed for prevention.  A law on environmental
protection was introduced in 1994, and companies like the Dong Nai
Paper Company are being told to clean up or close down.

The state-run media has also been peppered in recent months with
articles critical of careless exploitation of resources,
particularly deforestation and indiscriminate use of fertilisers
for cash crops such as coffee and rubber.

The World Wide Fund for Nature says Vietnam's forest cover is just 19
percent today, against 43 percent in 1943.   Remote-sensing data
shows that at current reduction rates, the natural primary forests
will disappear within 20 years.

"At this juncture of Vietnam's development it is important not to repeat
the mistakes of many other countries, particularly some of the
neighbouring countries," Nay Tuen, the UNDP's Asia-Pacific
Director, said at one conference on the environment.

Nevertheless, critics say the authorities still show a worrying
tendency to brush pollution problems under the carpet.  A recent
oil spill in the Mekong Delta, for example, was reported days later
in the local press and officials refused to go further than confirm
it had happened.

VIETNAM: What's in a road ?

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Laos and Vietnam are like two lovers sleeping together, but if they are
to grow together the roads linking them must be expanded and
upgraded.  The Lao's want the access to Vietnam's deep water ports that
will wean them away from expensive road transport and Bangkok.  The
Vietnamese are looking for tourist and trade links across Laos to
Thailand.  A number of options have been put forward, some by Laos,
others by Vietnam.  There is no doubt as to the benefits should road
links between Laos and Vietnam improve.

Route 8 which links Paksane with Vinh in Vietnam is the road most
favoured by the Lao's.  It is the shortest route from Thailand to
Vietnam, as well as from Vientiane to Vietnam.  The 260 kms of the road
that
is in Vietnam is in reasonable condition while much of the Laotian part
is barely usable over mountainous, winding terrain.  The road also
complements the continuing construction of Nam Theun 2 and Nam
Theun Hinboon hydro power plants.  Route 9 connects Mukdahan with
Savannakhet in Laos and Vietnam's central port town of Da Nang, some 500
kms away.  Again, in Vietnam it is in fairly good shape while in Laos it
is in bad need of repair.  There are plans, perhaps dreams would be
a better description, to revamp an old railway that runs parallel
to Route 9.

Both routes are seen as new avenues for the free flow of goods
between industrial northeastern Thailand and Vietnam.  Developing them
is a priority project for the Asian Development Bank, which is the
main advocate of a sub-regional cooperation scheme for six
countries sharing the Mekong River: China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma,
Thailand and Cambodia.

Since Vietnam is pressing ahead towards industrialisation or
semi-industrialisation by the year 2000 its leaders are aiming for
social, political as well as economic results by promoting direct
foreign investment in what is the poorest part of the country.
Laos, for its part, is serious about economic development and
raising the people's standard of living.  By 2000 it wants to see
its per capita income up to $500 a year and to introduce
electricity to at least half of Savannakhet province.  It is hoping
that renovating Routes 8 and 9 will give the province the magical
impetus.

The economic boast will, of course, come from he hundreds of
millions of dollars needed for the upgrade.  Its not just the roads
that require money.  Besides upgrading and reconstructing roads,
software issues like customs and immigration procedures also have
to be worked out.  The ADB is reported to be committed to financial
assistance, but disbursement will take time.  But once it does
start to roll out its millions there will be plenty all round for
foreign expertise and investment in the tourist infrastructure
associated with the two projects.

BURMA: The good news and the bad news

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Rangoon:

Stephen Huen, executive director of the UE Myanmar Group, briefly
comments here on the good news and the bad news of doing business
in Myanmar.

FIRST, THE GOOD NEW...

1.    Myanmar is safe.

2.    Business can be conducted in English.

VIETNAM: Hold that lease

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Imagine that you're found your ideal office on home in Vietnam and the
lease is awaiting signature.  Before signing it would be wise to
consider the hidden extras.  An apparent `good deal' could be a
disaster in the making.

Depending on whether one is in the north or the south, measurement
can very greatly.  In the north, most buildings are let on a nett
internal area basis.  In the south, most projects are offered on a
gross area basis which means that tenants are charged for all the
common areas.  These could occupy as much as 20% of the floor area.

Rents are usually quoted nett of taxes and service charges, the
latter ranging from $3 to $8 psm.  When paying rent, expect also to
pay the 20% tax that is levied on the landlord's income.  That
brings the psm cost to 110% of rental.  Car parks are seldom
included in a rental.  They could cost an extra $100 psm per month.
 Even parking a bicycle may not be free.  Where daytime
air-conditioning costs may be included in the service costs, night
time or holiday air-conditioning will be extra.  The ideal building
should have a separate electricity meter for every tenant.

Once the extras have been understood and factored into the rental,
the lease can be signed.  Then one is faced with fit-out costs of
$250 psm for average quality to up to $1,000 psm for a quality that
approximates the best that Hongkong would have to offer.

It is vital that a tenant has clear understanding of what be is
getting.  In Vietnam, the `fair' part of a deal is usually found on the
side of the Vietnamese.

CAMBODIA: Caltex aims for 10%

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Phnom Penh:

It's been 21 years since Caltex was last in Cambodia.  The US oil
giant has re-entered the Cambodian market on a wave of confidence
starting with the first American owned retail outlet since 1975.

Caltex has plans to invest $20m in Cambodia, opening some 20
service stations in Phnom Penh and major provincial cities and
building a major oil depot at Sihanoukville.

"We see great potential here," said Clifton Hon, chairman of the
Caltex Group of Companies based in Singapore.

He said studies indicated that Cambodia's current
11,000-barrel-per-day consumption of petroleum products could more
than quadruple in the coming decade if its economy develops along
the lines of its neighbours.

"We're hoping for at least a 10% market share very quickly," said
John Raeside, the general manager of Caltex Cambodia Ltd.

Five other Caltex stations are now under construction in the
capital and the company is looking at sites to build on in
Cambodia's second-largest city of Battambang and in the populous
east-central province of Kampong Cham.

The service stations will eventually be supplied by the $8m
Sihanoukville depot which will handle oil from Caltex refineries in
Singapore and Thailand.

The depot is expected to be completed in mid-1997 and until then
products will be shipped up the Mekong River to the port in Phnom
Penh.

VIETNAM: Viet Kieu fail to invest

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Saigon:

Supporting one's relations is one thing, supporting the government
is another.  That seems to be the rationale behind the reluctance
of Viet Kieu to invest in their old homeland.  Only a trickle of
investment has found its way back from overseas Vietnamese, who
remain mostly unconvinced by the tax breaks and preferential
treatment on offer.  Viet Kieu investment is around half a per cent
of foreign invested capital.  Since Vietnam launched its reforms in 1988
only $130m has come from Viet Kieu.  Of that, only $7m can be
attributed to the 1.5 million Vietnamese who settled in America.

Hanoi has offered a 20% reduction in taxes and a flat five-percent
tax on profit remittances.  Viet Kieu are given the same rights as
domestic firms to lease property and hire staff unlike other
foreign investors.

But as one Viet Kieu told BNI, " we may look stupid, but we are not
stupid."  Viet Kieu continue to help their relations to the tune of
$600m a year in remittances to fund hotels, restaurants and shops
that remain outside official channels.  Those few who do return
chaff under the country's dual pricing system that makes foreigners
pay more than double what locals pay for hotels and airfares.

While welcoming their money, officials remain suspicious of people
who fled and many Viet Kieu complain of harassment by security
services.  Despite the repeated pledges by the government that it
wants to close the chapter on the past, anxieties about the
political and social impact of Viet Kieu remain near the surface.

Communist Party chief Do Muoi warned in a recent speech that Saigon
was a hotbed of sabotage plots concocted by "hostile forces," a
reference to overseas Vietnamese groups opposed to the government.

CAMBODIA: Cambodia has its own 'bullet' train

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

'Bullet' trains in Cambodia take on a whole new meaning.  Not only
do the Khmer Rouge shoot them up, but when the soldiers who are
supposedly guarding the railway lines get bored they let fly with a
few bullets, too.  Being a passenger on a Cambodian train is often
a death sentence.  The northwest line from Phnom Penh to Battanbang
is subject to attack by the Khmer Rouge which continues to wage an
effective guerilla war along the Thai border.

In addition to rebel and bandit attacks the Royal Railways of
Cambodia (RRC) face horrendous maintenance problems.  The railway
is 70 years old.  For the past 25 years zero maintenance was
undertaken.  Locomotives are a mixture of Russian, American and
Chinese machines and often one finds an old wood or coal burner
chugging through the rice paddies.  Passenger transport is
nonexistent with freight trains being used to haul largely
nonpaying riders.

RRC embarked on a major modernization drive earlier this year
following the launch of a new nonstop freight train service between
Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville.  Travelling time has been halved to 6
hours.  That is still double the road time.  RRC has made track
upgrade on this sector its top priority so that speeds of up to 70
Kph could be achieved - double the current maximum.

The Asian Development Bank has been strongly supportive of RRC's
efforts to modernize, contributing $5m to rehabilitate 16 bridges,
repair culverts and embankments and replace wooden sleepers with
concrete ones.  While much work on the southern line remains to be
done, the train now runs on a regular daily basis.  The track
through Kampot, halfway between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, is
still in bad shape despite emergency rehabilitation.  The new
freight service from the coast is being mainly used to move
containers.  Sihanoukville is virtually an all-container port these
days and the train provides a cheap and relatively secure means of
getting cargo to the capital and empty containers back to the port.

RRC's director, Pich Kimsreang, would like to see Cambodia
connected to Thailand in the west and Saigon in the east.  He
commented, "The railway is very important for the tourism industry.
 We want to upgrade the existing lines and look into expansion of
the domestic network and at the same time link Cambodia to the
international railway network."

That, of course, depends on the defeat of the Khmer Rouge.  Only
then can RRC bury its reputation for 'bullet' train service.

VIETNAM: Viet cinemas get a boost

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Hanoi:

Three years ago Vietnam had about 300 cinemas.  Today, only a handful
are left as owners rushed to convert them into more profitable
bars, restaurants and KTV dens.  Hanoi has only two cinemas for its
3 million people.  Those cinemas that remain open for business
usually only show Vietnamese films.  These have lost out in
popularity in recent years to imported movies from Hong Kong
watched at home or shown in street-side video bars.  Several US
films, including the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie True Lies,
have been screened at cinemas over the past year.

A cinema renaissance is about to begin with the arrival of an
American and a Thai company that hope to renovate several crumbling
Vietnamese cinemas and build new multiplex centres that will show
the latest US movies.

Vision Net International (VietnamI) has signed with state movie
distribution company Faflim to renovate cinemas in Hanoi, Saigon
and Da Nang, VietnamI would build 20 multiplex cinemas with up to four
screens, each with audience capacity of 300.  Fafilm, a state firm
known for its conservatism, will maintain control over the films
that are chosen for release.

VietnamI joins Kantana Group, a major Thai entertainment company that
intends to invest $40m in Indochina using satellite theatres, or
miniplexers as the Americans prefer to say.

In Laos, Kantana is operating three conventional cinemas.  It hopes
to establish 10 and 30 of its conventional cinemas in Cambodia and
Vietnam respectively.  This at a time when cinema attendance in Vietnam
has
dropped to almost zero and that country's number of operating
conventional cinemas has dropped to only 3.

Kantana believes that if conventional cinemas are received
positively without too many operational problems, Indochina could
well see the launch of 300 plus satellite theatres.  Kantana would
open them at the rate of 5 a year in the first phase and the
remainder in place and operating by 2005.

The main thrust of Kantana's cinema strategy in Indochina is to
introduce satellite theatre complexes.  But this first requires
operators who are familiar with the conventional theatre business.
Hence the initial emphasis on conventional cinemas.

The problem that Kantana and VietnamI will face is not so much in the
attractiveness of its cineplexes which is a given, but on whether
Indochinese can afford them.  Vietnam, the richest and most developed of
the Indochinese countries, has an average GDP of only $250, rising
to $850 in Saigon.  That doesn't leave much for more than one or
two visits a year to the movies.

BANGKOK: Giant remains cautious on VN

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

Thailand's biggest cement maker, Siam Cement (SCC), is in no hurry
to establish a cement plant in Vietnam.  It cited inaccurate demand and
supply forecasts for its hesitancy.  This is in spite of it being
in Vietnam for the last four years sheparding investments as diverse as
roof tile manufacture and property development.  It has a $10m roof
tile venture in Song Be, near Saigon, where it also hopes to
produce sanitaryware.  But its real reason for being in Vietnam remains
the sale of its cement.

SCC was lured to Vietnam by Hanoi's forecast of annual cement demand of
20 million tons within the next four years versus annual production
of only 7.2 million tons.  Vietnam's construction boom has attracted
foreign investors to plunge into capital intensive cement
production, with five joint ventures licensed to date and another
awaiting approval.  That one involves Taiwan's Universal Cement and
two Vietnamese groups: Ha Tu Limestone Cement Enterprise in Quang
Ninh province and Vietnam Coal Corp (Vinacoal).  It would invest
$240m to produce 1.28 million tons a year of clinker and 1.5
million tons of cement.

By the end of this year Vietnam will have 25 cement factories.  Although
attractive to investors, the large scale of such projects and the
complexity of doing business in Vietnam have driven many to look for
government or multilateral guarantees for financing.  Especially
when they are all up and running there is a strong possibility of a
glut in the market.  Domestic cement production is expected to hit
nearly 20 million tons by 1999.  A surplus that would have to be
relieved through export or the lowering of operating levels.
Annual per capita consumption of cement in Vietnam is less than 100
killogrammes compared with Thailand's 420 and South Korea's 1,300.

At present SCC exports 80-100 container loads of its Elephant brand
cement to Vietnam each month.  It is looking at supplying related
produts such as premix concrete, paper pulp and paper-packaging.
It is also looking at other ASEAN markets to determine the best
logistical location for cement production.

LAOS: China cargoes transit Mekong

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Vientiane:

With China's southern province of Yunnan, Thailand, Burma and Laos
already part of a cooperative economic quadrangle, the next logical
step is to use the common waters of the Mekong River to transit
cargoes from China through to Thailand.  A private Thai company,
Lan Chang International (LCI) intends to do just that.  It hopes to
obtain permission from Laos to carry Chinese goods down the Mekong
to Thailand's port of Laem Chabang.

LCI already transports goods and tourists through the Yunnan Water
Transportation Company.  Its Chinese partner has 49% of the
company, LCI 41% and the balance split between Burma and Laos.  The
most popular route for tourists is from Chiang Saen in Chiang Rai
Province to Xisuangpanna in Yunnan.

A successful test transportation run for cargo along the Mekong
River was first carried out last year, with a vessel carrying
apples from China to Thailand through the Chiang Saen port in
Thailand's Chiang Rai province.

BANGKOK: Neighbours chase investment

from BUSINESS VIETNAM, November 1, 1996

Bangkok:

BOTH LAOS and Cambodia are keen to get their hands on the regional
investment dollar.  A recent seminar in Bangkok saw speaker after
speaker from Cambodia and Laos plead for more foreign funding of
their market economies.  If an investment could generate hard
currency, all the better.

For Laos, emphasis is being placed on investments in
hydroelectricity, mineral extraction and processing, agribusiness,
wood products, export-oriented light manufacturing, small-scale
tourism, and financial and transport services.

At present there are 230 projects in Laos that have been funded by
foreign investors, but only 168 are still operating.  It is still a
more encouraging figure than that found in Vietnam where only one third
of licensed projects are actually established.

Cambodia wants foreigners to invest in its still shaky tourist
industry which, for many investors, remains the easiest way to get
their hands on foreign currency.  Where Laos wants to shepard
investors into the state sector, Cambodia has no preference and
appears equally happy when an investor works through his private
contacts as with the country's national tourism board.

Dear Editor: Correcting facts on ECCs

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Antonio G. M. La Vina

This refers to today's (Sept. 12) issue of BusinessWorld which ran an
item entitled "DENR sitting on the ECCs of four major energy projects."

We would like to correct the impression brought about by the
abovementioned title in view of the following facts: 1. The ECC for the
Sunrise Power Corporation was granted by the DENR just yesterday, Sept.
11, 1996. The project involves the construction and operation phases of
a 23-megawatt diesel/bunker power plant to serve the Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Products Corp. of the Pacific, a locator within the PNOC-Petrochemical
Development Corp. Industrial Estate in Brgy. Batangas II, Mariveles,
Bataan. 2. The application of the Tarlac Power Corp. is for the
construction of a 30 MW bunker fired power plant expansion of the
existing 6.4 MW Heavy Fuel Engine Power Generating Plant in Bgy. Sto.
Nino, Tarlac, Tarlac, to augment Tarlac's power needs. The EIA review
Committee, on 5 September 1996, forwarded its recommendation to the
DENR Central Office and is now being reviewed for  consideration/approval
by the Secretary. 3.

The San Pascual Cogeneration Project, which involves the construction
and operation of a combined cycle cogeneration plant at the Caltex
Batangas Refinery in San Pascual, Batangas has been recommended by the
EMB on 29 July 1996 for issuance of ECC.

However, some clarifications with the proponent and the Review Committee
are necessary with respect to land ownership and land classification. 4.
The proposal for the Lake Mainit Hydroelectric Project of the Agusan Power
Corp. is a 22-MW Hydroelectric Power Plant in Jabonga, Agusan del Norte.

On 6 September 1996, the DENR Central Office returned the papers to the
EMB and the EIA Review Committee in view of necessary information on the
project's impact area, considering that the project will involve among
others the boring of a 3.2 km. tunnel under the Malimono Ridge from
Lake Mainit.

The Department wishes to clarify that the Environmental Impact
Assessment System involves the submission by the proponents of Impact
Statements which are subjected to the evaluation of an independent
group of experts. Considering the variability of local conditions and
the extent and variety of projects we receive, it is expected that
information in addition to the standard set of documents submitted will
be required as evaluation takes place, leading to the impression that
the DENR does not act expeditiously.

In view of this, we have been trying to fast track evaluation and tried
to improve on the system. We are presently revising the EIA guidelines
with the objective of streamlining the procedures.

We hope the above explains the issue. ANTONIO G.M. LA VINA
Undersecretary for Legal, Legislative Affairs and Attached Agencies, &
OIC, Undersecretary for Environment and Programs Development

Dear Editor: Nuclear test ban

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Maria Athena Ronquillo

Greenpeace welcomes the overwhelming approval by the United Nations
General Assembly (UNGA) of a "zero-yield" Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
resolution last September 10 in New York. We now urge the five nuclear
powers (US, UK, Russia, France and China) to sign the treaty as soon as
it is opened for signature, and to commit themselves to pursuing
complete nuclear disarmament.

Twenty-five years ago this month, Greenpeace was launched to peacefully
protest nuclear weapons testing. We view this treaty as a milestone in
the history of the nuclear age and an extraordinary way to mark our
anniversary.

We must now channel the overwhelming worldwide momentum toward the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into efforts to eliminate all nuclear
weapons.

The Philippines, together with Indonesia, Malaysia and other ASEAN
countries helped small countries propel the overwhelming signing of the
UN resolution.

The overwhelming vote at the United Nations is a moral victory for the
peace movement, for the little people everywhere and for all Asian NGO
colleagues who have campaigned for an end to nuclear testing for the
past 50 years.

The treaty can take effect only after the signature and ratification of
44 specific countries, including India, which so far refuses to sign.
It is, therefore, essential that the US and the four other nuclear
powers ratify the treaty soonest and affirm their commitment never to
test nuclear weapons again.

On behalf of Greenpeace International, MARIA ATHENA RONQUILLO Regional
Energy Campaigner, Southeast Asia #49 Matatag St., Bgy. Pinyahan, QC

Dear Editor: Clarification

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Jesus Matubis Jr.

BusinessWorld carried the story about Sec. Robert Z. Barbers'
memorandum delineating the responsibilities of the two undersecretaries
of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Messrs. Alvin
G. Dans, for Peace and Order, and Manuel R. Sanchez for Local
Government.

While we are thankful for the exposure, we wish to correct however
certain inaccuracies in the story, among them the incorrect
interpretation conveyed by the accompanying headline (DILG's Barbers
dumps Dans for Sanchez) that Undersecretary Dans was "dumped," or, as
such a term normally implies, "removed," and the reference in the story
to a supposed rift between Dans and Director Serafin Benaldo as the
probable cause of Dans' transfer.

To set the record straight, Dans himself was the one who requested that
he be made responsible for the Interior or Peace and Order sector of
the DILG. This request Secretary Barbers acceded to.

Thus, while Dans may have had a policy difference with Benaldo on the
funding of the proposed Community Development Assistance Project, as
mentioned in the story, this was not at all the basis for Secretary
Barbers' decision.

We hope this will clarify matters. JESUS MATUBIS JR. Director
Department of the Interior and Local Government

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Joel B. Ramos

Congratulations! Through your columnist, Daniel F. DeLong, someone has
decided to stand up to all of the abuse thrown on us smokers. In his
column last week, Mr. DeLong pointed out the restrictions and he
destroyed the myths spread by the ill-informed members of society.

If you think that you can help yourself by giving up cigarettes, then
you need to do so. Leave the rest of us alone!

Next time you commute, please look at all the people who are forced to
cover their noses so that the exhaust fumes of the buses and jeepneys
don't kill them. These are the killers of this society.

I do have 'em and I do plan to continue smoking 'em. JOEL B. RAMOS

Across the Board: Graft watch - 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Ismael G. Khan, Jr.

Two columns ago (BW, Sept. 5, 1996) I wrote about a nascent movement
that is designed to mount a constant "graft watch" on those activities
of government that readily lend themselves to graft and corruption.
Former presidents of the Personnel Management Association of the
Philippines (PMAP) and that organization's Society of Fellows are in
the vanguard of this effort.

In a meeting yesterday, the former PMAP presidents, led by Greg
Imperial and Wency Malabanan, began to map out doable plans to assist
the Ramos Administration - assuming that it would welcome this
proffered assistance - in sustaining its avowed campaign to go hammer
and thongs against officials and employees who betrayed or are
betraying the public trust.

Much on the administration's political will and sincerity to ensure the
success of this campaign.

Despite the fact that the Philippines has probably the toughest laws
against public malfeasance and misfeasance, there has been no serious
prosecution under any of those laws. Both the PCGG and the Ombudsman
are proving to be no match to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of
these criminal civil servants and their co-conspirators in private
business.

While hidden wealth may take some doing, unexplained wealth should not
be too difficult to pin down if our so-called "graft-busters" truly set
their minds and hearts to it. A citizens' "Graft Watch" may just light
a fire in their behind and put it in their belly.

Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and
Singapore's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) are two of
the world's most successful anti-corruption agencies, either of which
can serve as a very useful and workable model for the Philippines.

It is not by happenstance that both Hong Kong and Singapore are
paragons of a graft-free society where laws are actually enforced
regardless of who gets hurt, and crooked officials are actually put
behind bars. It is interesting to know, for example, that the
establishment of Hong Kong's ICAC in 1974 was precipitated by rampant
police corruption in the Crown Colony.

Dr. Raymond Pomerlau of the San Francisco State University has made a
career of studying graft and corruption in Asia, particularly in Korea,
Taiwan, and China. He has identified a number of strategies which he
maintains are imperative in the battle against institutionalized
corruption in government. Among them: "1. Corrupt activity must be
treated seriously and not dressed up in the rhetoric of morality.
Political will and an avowed policy of implementation must be secured.
Adequate budgetary and independently established human resources must
be pressed into service. Compre-hensive investigative and innovative
legal measures must be consistent with due process laws. "2.
Appropriate administrative infrastructure must be invoked. Fundamental
changes in public attitudes must be encouraged and an ethical value
system must be prompted. Application of punishment for corrupt
practices must be exercised swiftly, equitably, and without exception.
"3. Boundaries between government and business must be distanced.
Contributions to political campaigns must be legalized under stringent
guidelines. Social encounters must not turn into money-denominated
exchanges. "4. Pursuit of private gain must never be at the expense of
public duty. 'Honest graft' and 'dishonest graft' must be called
corruption. Laws must remain the most important means of combat
corruption. Principles of transparency must be institutionalized in the
body politic. "5. And ,finally, national integrity must be avowed as
the linchpin of the nation's well-being."

If the foregoing moral "infrastructure" could be put in place in our
country, there will be hope yet that we can prevail in the war against
graft and corruption.

Upshot: For 30 pieces of silver

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Bernardo V. Lopez

For a lousy 30 pieces of silver, Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota decided
to retain the controversial US bases. The Japanese government offered
oodles of development aid so that Ota would capitulate and reverse his
stand to get rid of the bases. He could not resist the offer,
nullifying an overwhelming plebiscite where about 90 per cent of
Okinawans voted to get rid of the bases. That's the way the cookie
crumbles.

Bases withdrawal was replaced with "bases reduction," which really
amounts to nothing, just a few square meters lopped off to appease the
angry crowd. The strong protests of the Okinawans stems from the rape
last year of a school girl by three American GIs, which shocked the
conservative Okinawan community.

Ota led the protest but gave up when 30 pieces of silver, or a whopping
$45.8 million, was laid at his feet. Okinawa is one of the poorest
places in Japan with average income of half of Tokyo's.

The base leases held by about 3,000 landowners mostly opposed to the
base expire in May 1997. This may just make the Ota decision useless.
Some of the biggest in the eastern hemisphere since Subic was lost, the
Okinawa bases are home to 47,000 American soldiers, the largest
concentration of US troops in the entire Asia Pacific.

The strong anti-base feeling among the Japanese is also due to the
lesson of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Japan has one of the most resilient
anti-nuclear movements in the world. Many feel that Japan may just be
sucked into a regional nuclear confrontation because of the bases.
Ironically, Japan also has one of the most conservative military-minded
rulers who believe an alliance with the American superpower is the key
to peace in the Pacific.

Learning a lesson from Filipinos who got rid of the Subic naval base
without batting an eyelash, the Americans made sure this would not
happen in Japan, a crucial military partner in any confrontation with
China or Russia. The strong bilateral pressure from the Americans on
Japan's central government to retain the bases was, of course, realized
by the 30 pieces of silver, which is a drop in the bucket considering
how much the Americans spend to maintain 47,000 in the base. It is easy
for the US to bribe the 3,000 landowners or use force to renew the
leases in the future.

A Japanese journalist last year reported on a syndicate involving
Filipinos and Americans which has been secretly exporting Filipino
children to a neighborhood near the base, reportedly for the R&R of
American GIs.

The rape of the Japanese school girl is nothing compared to the mass
pedophilia that may be happening clandestinely in Okinawa, if the
allegation are true.

It was a useless trip last week to Subic for Okinawan officials led by
Mashiko Takara, chair of the Special Committee on Development of
Evacuated Military-Used Lands. They were eager to have their own base
withdrawal in their country. They came to study the base conversion
model at Subic with Filipino executives giving a lecture on the how-to
of base conversion.

Okinawa holds 40 of the 100 US bases scattered throughout Japan,
including its version of Clark Field, the Kadena Air Force Base. Over
and above the American bases, Japan has the most powerful and modern
air force in the entire Pacific, which has forced China to modernize
its air force in response.

Ninety per cent of the escalation of strategic weapons in the Pacific
is due to an overly superior Japanese air force with the Americans
benefiting in terms of billions of dollars worth of sale of the most
sophisticated airplanes.

Japan is the biggest arms spender by far in the entire Pacific,
believing that its future as a world economic power depends on it. Some
observers believe however this will cause its downfall.

Ironically, this thinking in the military and government centers
contrasts greatly with the essential anti-military and anti-nuclear
mentality of the Japanese public due to the trauma of World War II. The
problem is, the public has very little clout in the decisions upstairs
in spite of the effective mass sit-down strikes against the Yokosuka
naval base where the US "neither confirms or denies" the presence of
nuclear weapons.

With the loss of Subic, the strategic value of the Japanese US bases
has tripled as there is a gap between the bases in Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean (now participating actively in attacks against Iraq) and
Guam and the Japanese bases. Geopolitics dictate that the Americans
keep the Chinese sleeping giant at bay at intervals across its massive
coastal area. The geopolitical wisdom of containing a rival giant is,
however, questionable.

The Americans and the Japanese are the hawks of the Pacific who will
cause the next major confrontation because of their massive escalation
of weaponry. The chances of a bases withdrawal in Japan is practically
nil if the Japanese bureaucrats keep their medieval shogun mentality
contrary to the will of the public, which is the only only force that
can stop them.

The View from Taft: Effective leadership in a changing environment

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By John Malliris

In today's complex business environment - increasing global
competition, deregulation, political and economic protectionism - the
companies which implement continuous changes have competitive advantage
for survival.

Leadership is the most critical factor to implement such changes and
the driving force that causes an organization to stretch beyond its
normal range of performance.

The behavioral characteristics of a leader may be broadly categorized
into (1) charismatic and (2) instrumental.

The elements of charismatic behavior are knowledge, vision and energy.
A leader possessing these qualities is able to elicit employee support
and commitment. He is able to direct individual objectives, values,
aspirations and aggressiveness toward organizational benefits.

The elements of instrumental behavior are structuring, controlling and
appraisal. A leader is said to have these qualities if he is able to
define standards, clarify degree of authority and responsibility,
establish systems and processes to monitor behavior and results,
prescribe corrective actions and give meritorious rewards.

The combination of charismatic and instrumental behavioral
characteristics comprises effective leadership, which is necessary to
get meaningful changes and the best results.

The combination of these leadership characteristics is manifested in an
organization in its (1) dynamism, (2) personal interaction, (3)
integration of individual and group goals, and (4) structural fluidity.

Dynamism

In contrast to traditional management, leadership does not always
create consistency. It produces movement, action and change tough: a) a
high degree of directional intensity - new objectives, a vision for the
future and the commitment of people to power and purpose; b) alignment
and communication - direction to achieve the vision; and c) motivation
- adoption of new values and discarding of old habits.

Personal Interaction

A successful organization calls for the leader's personal participation
and interaction with people. It means asking the right people the right
questions and listening to their opinions as well as to facts. For
example, instead of simply relying on statistics in submitted reports,
a leader can directly ask a service engineer to determine the time
spent in the field against the time spent in the office.

Integration of Individual and Group Goals

Effective leaders give meaning to the people in their organization by:
a) making them understand what a particular vision means to them; b)
assisting individuals across the organization to find a greater purpose
in their working environment; c) empowering people to become involved
in the change effort and be responsible for getting extraordinary
results; d) adopting a certain style so others can be comfortable with
them.

Structure Fluidity

Effective leadership is also dependent on the leader's ability to
develop high-level management groups or leadership teams whose members
interact principally to share information and make decisions. This
relieves the leader of part of his work load and at the same time
provides an excellent cross-disciplinary training ground for future
chief operating officers.

Many organizations have such management teams, composed of a collection
of senior level managers who more or less function together.
Unfortunately, a member occasionally throws his weight around to
conceal his inefficiencies.

High-performance organizations have "real" leadership teams with
members who are equally committed to a common purpose or goal, who
trust one another, and who hold themselves mutually accountable for
decision making.

In summary, an effective leader should be able to harness both his
charismatic and instrumental characteristics to steer his organization
to success in these times of rapid environmental changes.

Capetillo speaks English fluently. That's a relief. At least, we don't

Thalia's case. To recall, at the Araneta Coliseum concert, Thalia was
moved to tears when a giant birthday cake was wheeled onto the stage in
advance celebration of her birthday (Aug. 26). She told the crowd that
her tears (lagrimas) were like "perlas de amor," that she was offering

Reader Kenneth Yu is fuming mad. His telephone works sporadically and
"yet, PLDT has the gall to bill me for the period my phone was not
working." He said the first time he complained, a lineman came and said
the problem was a defective line and that this would be checked.
However, when nothing happened after a few days, Mr. Yu called up PLDT
service and was told the problem was not with the line but with the
conduit line inside his building. This went on for two to three weeks.
Finally, Mr. Yu said he was told by a lineman that PLDT service wanted
its "statistics" to be manageable, meaning complaints about defective
lines should be within a specific number. Any complaint beyond the
accepted statistical boundary is logged under another category. If
true, can the public be further enlightened on this technicality?

ShopTalk: Mismanaged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

The Department of Agriculture faces the possibility of losing
fertilizer grants from Japan and Canada. Negotiated by then National
Food and Agriculture Council chief Domingo F. Panganiban in the early
'70s, the grants were supposed to be bidded out to fertilizer companies
which would then sell them to end-users, paying the government the cost
of the chemical plus a margin. When Mr. Panganiban left government
service with the entry of the Aquino regime in 1987, he said he turned
over about P780 million in proceeds from the fertilizer grants. During
the Aquino regime, the bidding process was junked and the National
Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the grant's implementing agency,
opted to award the grant to basically three groups. As of last
accounting, these groups owe the government about P300 million. Of this
P300 million, about P120 million is owed by Sanduguan, a farmers'
organization. Canada is apparently disturbed by these developments and
is now considering coursing its fertilizer grants through private
fertilizer companies. Petty graft it can live with, but not the
magnitude of corruption in the handling of the grant. Tokyo has also
expressed concern and has required projects to benefit from its grant
to get its prior approval. Again, tsk, tsk...

Time was when talk of constitutional changes were never even given a

President Ramos himself appears to be sending out the message. For one,
several Lakas-NUCD congressmen had observed that many unnecessary
provincial trips are being undertaken by the chief executive. Another
congressman claimed it was Malacanang which authored all the ruckus to

Unlike in Manila where taxi drivers take 12-hour shifts, taxi drivers
in Cebu are usually on 24-hour duty. Only a handful of operators do not
follow this practice. As it is virtually impossible to stay awake
during the whole shift, it is normal, according to our informed source,
for Cebuano taxi drivers to take shabu. And the riding public knows it.
And what do you know, there is also no effort on the part of drivers to
hide that they are taking this upper. Tourists without cars and who
want to check out night spots in the Queen City of the South must be a
little more careful. Taking a cab may not be the safest way to get

Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino continues to face some

seven member states of ASEAN are throwing their support behind Mr.
Severino's bid, the organization's current chief, Datu Ajit Singh of
Malaysia, is persistently lobbying for a second five-year term when his
ends in 1998. Sources told BusinessWorld the majority of the ASEAN
members want to see some changes in the organization. They want the
Malaysian diplomat to give way to Mr. Severino, who they believe could
inject some vigor and new ideas to the laid-back attitude of the
secretariat. Apparently, ASEAN's chief caretaker is afraid of facing
early retirement from the diplomatic service. Sources said the
Malaysian diplomat can no longer go back to the Malaysian foreign
service because he is of retirable age. The Philippine government wants
to secure the commitment of its colleagues in ASEAN this December

One Voice: What is love?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 5

By Vicky P. Garchitorena

She is small for her age and not given to much talk, at least not in
front of strangers: Rhona Mahilum, the 8-year-old girl who went into
their burning hut time and again in order to bring out her little
siblings. Her shoulders are hunched up as a result of the scarring of
the tissues from her neck, contracting the connecting muscles.

Her mother is a small woman and just as quiet.

She had to walk 15 kilometers carrying Rhona over her shoulders like a
lamb in order to avoid further destroying the burned flesh on her back.
She ignored her husband's command to just bury the child, whom he
thought was already dead. She walked thus to the nearest hospital to
seek treatment for her little girl.

Two small women. Two great heroines.

What is it that made them do what they did? What drove Rhona to
overcome her natural instinct for self-preservation and to brave the
heat of the flames in order to save her brothers and sisters? How could
she ignore the agony of her burning back? Whence came that courage come
in one so young?

Perhaps the maternal instinct of the mother was more understandable.
She refused to give up hope. She refused to give up her child. Rhona,
on the other hand, risked her own life. Not once but four times. And
she's only eight years old.

When I went to visit Rhona at the Ospital ng Maynila, two
representatives from the Readers' Digest happened to be there, too. One
of them asked me where I thought that act of courage of Rhona came
from. I could only say that it must have been her great love for her
brothers and sisters that made her do it.

I believe that God has given each of us the capacity to love. That love
manifests itself in different ways in our different relationships in
life. But, perhaps, some have been given a greater capacity than
others. Rhona certainly had it in large measure. As did her mother.

I can only imagine that the mother must have shown Rhona and the family
a quality of quiet love and caring that was deeply impressed in the
little girl's mind and heart.

Perhaps she was reflecting that same love and concern when she forgot
herself and her own safety totally and completely in order to save the
lives of her loved ones.

It has been said that "a greater love than this no man has, that he lay
down his life for another."

Rhona has shown us that pure and selfless love such as that Christ
showed us still exists in this world.

Her example should be held up for all Filipinos, indeed for all
mankind, to see and appreciate so that we do not lose hope for our
nature. Her example should silence the cynics who insist that looking
out for number one is the only valid lifestyle for our modern day.

Rhona was to have been operated on this week to remove the scar tissue
and to release the muscles that had contracted along her neck and
shoulders. After a few more months to ensure her good health, she will
be released from the hospital where she has been staying with her
mother and two younger sisters.

The trust fund that Mayor Alfredo Lim of Manila started has grown to
about P1.7 million. Its earnings are intended to ensure the health and
education of the children.

They are fortunate that such a Trust Fund has been set up. All too
often, we see similar donations that are simply frittered away by a
family that is not used to handling and managing such large amounts of
funds.

There is, of course, the concern that Rhona may become spoiled by all
the attention and all the largesse that is being heaped upon her. It
has also been reported that a movie is being planned on her act of
great daring and heroism and selflessness.

We can only pray that her mother will have the character and the
courage to see to it that she remains a loving and simple child.

Rhona's act of great love reaffirms our humanity. She has shown us what
all of us are capable of. She has shown us how to be heroes. She has
shown us the true meaning of love.

My Turn: Caught in traffic on a rainy night

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 4

By Daniel F. DeLong

It's probably a matter of sheer, stupid luck. When it rains, somehow I
manage to find reasons not to go out.

But the man who coined the phrase, "It's better to be lucky than good,"
didn't have driving in the rain here in Metro Manila on his mind when
he uttered those words.

Because, as we all know, luck has a tendency to run out.

I had to go to the New World Hotel in Makati on a recent afternoon for
a story. It turned out there wasn't a story.

On the way home, it began to rain. I knew I was in trouble sitting at
the corner of Ayala Avenue and EDSA, waiting to turn left so I could
return to New Manila.

To begin with, it took the light nearly 10 minutes to switch to green.

We all moved like greyhounds through the pounding rain, for one block.
From Buendia to the house, a distance of 10 kilometers, it took another
96 minutes.

By now, the tape I was listening to had already finished one side and
it was running to the conclusion so that the machine could flip it to
the other side.

The cars were moving like something out of a nightmare. Slow, slower
and S-L-O-W-E-S-T. Finally, no movement at all.

I had the air conditioner turned on so that I didn't have to breathe
the horrible exhaust fumes coming from the buses to the right that
seemed intent on blocking progress for all of mankind. The windows were
beginning to steam up.

"We're all blind!" I thought. "How can anyone see anything?" So I
rolled each one down and back again to improve vision. It still looked
the same as it did before.

About 20 minutes later I cleared up the windows again and I happened to
look off to the left at a bunch of signboards that were grouped tightly
together.

Two of the advertisements were for shoes. "Yes," I thought to myself,
"walking would probably be better - even in this confounded rain that
doesn't seem to want to stop."

The bottom signboard was from a major distributor of condoms.

"That board should have been there 20 years ago," I mumbled to no one.
"If it had, perhaps traffic tonight would be better."

Despite the fact that we were moving, if you want to call it that, so
slowly that I was passed three times by the same vendor - yes, street
vendors walking on EDSA - I continually found myself in between lanes.

I try as much as possible to pick a lane on the road and stay there
throughout my trip. Sometimes, however, what we want and what we do are
not the same things.

A dear friend of mine has a fantasy about driving here. He would like
to build a car with reinforced steel that could absorb impact, and then
driving with a photographer and his insurance man, go out on the roads
and operate his motor vehicle like they do in the US.

In case you don't know, a man's place in a lane is something that
cannot be violated. If, for some strange reason it is, there will be
trouble.

My friend theorizes that he would be a one-man teaching crew, showing
the locals how it is supposed to be done.

So what would life be without fantasies?

On EDSA, it's the buses. They ruin it for everyone. Why doesn't the
government take control? It would be better to put up with inefficiency
than to suffer the current conditions.

Also to blame is Henry Sy, Sr. While he keeps building malls, he isn't
doing it fast enough for the population to spread out.

Once I asked him why doesn't he build more roads so that the people can
get to his malls to spend their money faster?

He simply smiled, shrugged his shoulders and simply moved on.

As I approached Megamall, I noted that the beginning of the end is
coming for the Ortigas Center, which is up in arms over a 300% increase
in property tax valuation.

"What," I asked my steering wheel, "will happen when they build out all
of the open space and there is nowhere to park a car?"

Already there is no water there because all the high-rise buildings
have sucked the precious commodity out of the ground.

Why do the developers here always worry about the most important things
after the damage has been done?

On Ortigas itself, heading through Greenhills, the problem is now
oversized trucks. There are container trucks, Coke trucks and trucks
hauling building material to construction sites. Why can't these things
wait until the commuters get home?

The trucks hauling materials to construction sites should wait until
after 10 p.m. No one is going to do anything with their load until the
next day anyway.

I've got a fantasy, too. But I can't share it with anyone because it's
probably illegal.

GrandAir to begin US flights starting February "97

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 19

By Marifi S. Jara

Grand International Airways, Inc. (GrandAir) is gearing up to begin
flights to the United States by February next year notwithstanding the
opposition lodged by flag-carrier Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL).

Eliseo Hizon, executive assistant to GrandAir's president and chief
executive officer, said in an interview that the airline has already
secured a permit from the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and that
they are just preparing several requirements.

"We have the permission from the US this December but probably it may
not push through because we have to meet certain requirements from the
FAA. We are working on those right now," Mr. Hizon said.

These requirements include the company's business plan, aviation safety
documents, and an environmental impact study, among others.

For its initial US operations, GrandAir plans to cover the
Manila-Honolulu-Los Angeles route with daily flights.

Mr. Hizon also said that once they begin their US services, they will
be looking at possible tie-ups with US carriers. "Not strategic
alliances, not yet. Maybe we will go for interline agreements which are
similar to code sharing and other forms of bilateral agreements. This
will all be possible as early as February 1997 as soon as we complete
our requirements."

Mr. Hizon said their permit for US flights, also known as the
transpacific route, was issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)
"about two or three months ago."

Officials of CAB could not be reached for confirmation as of press time.

Last June, PAL wrote a letter to the CAB asserting that GrandAir has no
right to fly more international routes until it receives a Certificate
of Public Convenience and Safety (CPCS).

The CPCS, issued by the government, serves as a permanent license for
operating in a service-oriented industry like aviation.

GrandAir is currently running under a temporary operating permit.

PAL also said in its letter that GrandAir should first secure from
government an official designation as the country's second national
carrier.

The Office of the President, which has to power to make such
designations, has yet to act on CAB's recommendation that GrandAir be
named a national carrier.

Earlier, GrandAir chief operating officer Angelo V. Balverde stressed
their planned international routes will cover the Philippine's air
traffic slots left unserviced by PAL. On the other hand, PAL has filed
an application before the CAB seeking to cover all of the country's
entitlements to the US under the RP-US Air Services Agreement.

GrandAir's current international operations consists of thrice a week
Manila-Hong Kong-Manila and Subic-Hong Kong-Subic flights.

Grand Air was granted a temporary operating permit to cover domestic
routes in December 1994 and October last year for international
destinations. Using a Boeing 737 aircraft, Grand Air's first
international flight bound for Hong Kong took off last April 3.

CAB recently approved GrandAir's application for Manila-Seoul-Manila
and Manila-Taipei-Manila flights. The airline is preparing to start
covering these routes before the end of the year.

The Panlilio-owned Grand Air, which has proven to be PAL's toughest
competitor since it started operations in March 1995, is also planning
flights to other Asian countries like Japan and Singapore which are
considered among the most lucrative routes.

In the domestic front, Grand Air currently serves flights to Cebu,
Davao, Tacloban and Cagayan de Oro with planned expansions to Iloilo,
Puerto Princesa, Kalibo, General Santos and Bacolod.

In another development, GrandAir has opposed the application of Air
Philippines Corp. for international flights, asserting the company is
financially and technically unfit for such services.

In a letter filed before the CAB last week, GrandAir, through its legal
counsel Roberto Rafael Lucila said, "The applicant is not fit and
qualified to engage in the business of international scheduled air
transportation services."

"The articles of incorporation of Air Philippines, Inc. provides that
the authorized capital stock of the corporation is P16 million - Hence,
this application fails to state the legal and financial fitness of the
applicant," the letter said.

The Panlilio-owned GrandAir, currently the only airline aside from
Philippine Airlines operating international flights, also cited the
recent grounding of Air Philippines as a sign of technical incompetence.

"Applicant does not possess the technical capability and fitness to
undertake the services applied for as its present domestic services
have been reportedly suspended by the Air Transportation (ATO)
recently, on the grounds of aviation safety requirements," Mr. Lucila
said.

The Subic-based Air Philippines was grounded by the ATO early this
month following a series of minor landing accidents. The ATO later
declared the airline unsafe. Upon compliance with requirements, ATO
lifted the suspension and allowed the airline to continue its services.

Air Philippines has resumed operations but it will still be under
government observation for a period of 30 days.

GrandAir further said Air Philippines failed to establish in its
application the need for a third international carrier for the country
as indicated in Executive Order No. 219.

Under EO 109, the law liberalizing the air transport industry, two
international carriers shall be designated as official carriers.

Additional airlines will only be designated if the first two fail to
meet passenger demand and are unable to use all the country's flight
entitlements under Air Service Agreements (ASA) with other countries.

"The application does not allege the urgent need for a new
international air carrier along the routes already being serviced or
applied for by GrandAir and Philippine Airlines. Specifically,
applicant failed to allege that the present designated carriers do not
service the total frequency entitlements of the Philippines under ASAs
or similar arrangement," Mr. Lucila said.

Air Philippines is majority-owned by plastics magnate William
Gatchalian and in part by three foreign groups. It currently flies to
Subic, Puerto Princesa, Davao, Tacloban, and Cagayan de Oro. It plans
to operate flights to the United States and countries within the Asia
Pacific region.

Philippine Ports Authority calls for selective liberalization

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

Relaxing the rules on interisland shipping to allow the participation
of foreign-owned vessels should be implemented on a regional basis, the
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) said.

In a letter, PPA general manager Carlos Agustin told the Maritime
Industry Authority (Marina) that lifting the cabotage law should be
done in stages since a unilateral declaration will only favor foreign
shipping lines to the disadvantage of the local sector.

A memorandum of agreement (MOA) is pending approval by officials of the
Marina and the Bureau of Customs (BoC). It will allow non-Filipinos to
engage in coastwise trade which is being vigorously opposed by local
shipowners.

The PPA said that before implementing the proposal, both offices should
conduct intensive consultations with industry experts to determine its
constitutionality.

A similar appeal was made by the Domestic Shipping Association which
asked the Marina and the BoC to secure the official opinion of the
Department of Justice. However, the two are still inclined to go ahead
with the MOA, saying they have direct jurisdiction.

The PPA said a reciprocity clause wherein the same arrangement can also
be availed of by Filipino firms should be explored by the two agencies,
adding that not all ports in the country may be able to meet the
requirements of prospective clients.

Local firms have raised apprehensions that the move will cut them out
of the competition since foreign vessels can charge domestic rates
without paying the same taxes required from domestic ships.

Currently, foreign ships can only pick up and unload cargoes at the
Manila International Container Terminal and South Harbor. This setup,
officials said, slows down the flow of cargo traffic and stifles the
growth of exporters.

Based on the MOA, foreign vessels that will engage in coastwise trade
will have to secure two clearances, one from the BoC and another from
the Marina. A vessel authorized to unload import cargoes at a local
port will be allowed to pick up export cargoes destined for the
vessel's port of call abroad or to another local port.

Officials said the MOA will merely provide an alternative since the
final choice will depend on shippers.

Financing woes plague bus firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 18

By Conrad M. Carino

Are bus companies becoming unattractive to banks and financing
companies? Industry sources said the bus industry, already hurting from
multiple factors, is finding it difficult to finance the acquisition of
new buses. Likewise, creditors are having a hard time collecting loans
from bus companies.

Alex Yague, president of the Provincial Bus Operators Association of
the Philippines (PBOAP) said banks are becoming very selective in
financing bus acquisitions since many companies are already hurting.

"Tingnan mo, ang daming mga bulok na bus na tumatakbo sa (Look around,
there are a lot of dilapidated buses plying) Metro Manila," he declared.

Other bus companies said the industry is hurting from factors such as
the recent wage increases, diesel price hikes and the unified vehicle
reduction program (UVRP).

They said that unlike jeepney operators, bus companies employ office
staff and a regular maintenance work force which are paid fixed wages.
In addition, prices of spare parts and new buses are no longer cheap. A
12-meter air-conditioned bus now costs around P4 million, while an
11-meter air-conditioned unit sells at around P2.7 million.

Financing companies are willing to shoulder up to 70% of the
acquisition cost with an interest rate of around 18% to 20%. The most
acceptable collateral for bus acquisitions is real estate. The maximum
period for installment payments is three years.

Unlike automobile buyers, bus companies are not offered of
zero-interest loans, low downpayment and easy installment plans.

"Hindi iyan uso sa industriya (that is not practiced in the industry),"
a source who requested anonymity told BusinessWorld.

A check with SOH Technologies Corp., one of the top three manufacturers
of brake drums for heavy vehicles, also points to hard times for the
bus industry. Company president Leon Ang said this is evidenced by the
slow cash collections from his customers.

Most maintenance parts of buses are locally fabricated. These include
brake drums, brake shoes, suspension leafs, suspension mountings and
air cleaners.

Of the problems confronting the bus industry, the UVRP may have the
most telling effect. Metro Manila bus operators contend that the scheme
has resulted to an average loss of almost P2,000 per vehicle per day.

On the other hand, provincial bus operators say they incur a loss of up
to P5,000 per vehicle per day because their units cannot exit nor enter
Metro Manila-based terminals.

Mr. Yague said losses of bus companies from the UVRP are expected to be
reduced since the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) agreed to
issue exemption stickers to 10% of bus operators' fleets. The stickers
are yet to be issued to the bus operators.

If worse comes to worse, bus companies will start shutting down and the
big ones are not exempted. Mr. Yague said one bus company with more
than 250 units stopped operations early this year due to bankruptcy.

He said the industry hopes no other bus company will suffer this fate
since this will make banks become more wary in providing loans.

Share prices dip on profit taking

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 12

By Rosemarie V. Francisco

Profit takers took advantage of the correction in the US blue chips
marker Dow Jones Industrials last Tuesday to collect their gains in the
local market after its two-day uptrend.

"People took it as a cue to harvest profits," said Monique Lecaros,
analyst of Armstrong Securities, Inc.

The composite index fell 11.13 points, or 0.34%, to 3,248.59. The
market was weak throughout the session, sagging 25.66 points at the
most to 3,234.06 during intraday trades.

Value turnover narrowed 19.94% to P2.49 billion. If the block sales
totalling P373.87 million were taken out, peso volume will amount to
P2.11 billion, still within the P2 billion mark. This reflects some
level of foreign participation in the market.

Volume of shares eased 9.49% to 18.51 billion. Of the total 171 issues
traded, decliners routed advancers, 66 to 37, while 68 were unchanged.

The local market simply mirrored the movement in the Dow Jones. The US
market closed marginally lower 0.37 point to 5,888.83 last Tuesday due
to a news report which stated that eight out of 12 regional Federal
Bank presidents have asked for an increase of at least 0.25 percentage
point in the discount rate on direct loans to banks. The US bond market
also reacted as the long bond ended weaker.

Investors took this as a sign that the US Federal Reserve is keen on
increasing interest rates during its Sept. 24 meeting even if economic
data released last week showed that the growth of the US economy is
still manageable and will not put pressure on inflation.

However, Ms. Lecaros noted that the Dow Jones did not correct
significantly. "It was merely a hangover after the party," she said.
The Dow Jones posted record highs for two consecutive days earlier this
week. Previously, analysts said the local market will follow the trend
set by the Dow Jones and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT)
listed in New York. But yesterday, the market ignored the uptick in
PLDT of $0.625 to $64.25 and focused instead on the US market's key
indicator. Local PLDT shares slipped 1.18% to P1,675.

Ms. Lecaros believes the local market's slide yesterday was expected
and that investors just used the Dow Jones' correction as a reason to
heed cash calls. "This market has risen too much in the past two days.
The rise is so unsettling," she said. Thus, the trading results
yesterday was partly due to a technical correction, negative sentiments
after the Dow Jones slide, and profit taking, she added.

The Phisix gained 66.04 points in the past two days after weeks of
sluggish trades.

While the bullish sentiments of foreign fund managers towards the
country is not waning, they are taking a cautious view of Asian markets
given the possible hike in US interest rates.

One sector at a disadvantage is the property stocks. "The strategy of
foreign fund managers is to stay out of the property stocks until the
uncertainty in the US market is not erased," Ms. Lecaros said. Property
issues are sensitive to the movement in interest rates. When the US
implements a rate hike, local monetary authorities will have to adjust
local interest rates accordingly to prevent foreign funds from flowing
out of the country.

In turn, high interest rates do not augur well for property companies
as the cost of housing loans will become too pricey for consumers.

"Things will continue to be uncertain until the 24th... As long as
there are uncertainties in interest rates, we will continue to be just
paced by the Dow Jones," Ms. Lecaros said.

Trades will remain cautious. Stocks in the consumer and industrial
counter will be picked up by foreign fund managers as these are the
likely performers next year given their solid fundamentals, the analyst
said. Foreign fund managers are entering the country to position for
1997.

Sectoral averages were mixed. The commercial and industrial index
weakened 33.70 points, or 0.76% to 4,391.26, the mining sector by 14.49
points, or 0.50%, to 2,865.46. The property sector edged up 1.44
points, or 0.86%, to 168.87, the oil counter gained 0.03 point, or
0.47%, to 6.41.

Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. A slid 2.38% to P4,100 while B shares
were untraded. Stockholders of the firm approved the capital buildup
program of the bank which includes an increase in the authorized
capital stock to P8 billion from P800 million.

Bacnotan Cement added 2.94% to P17.50. The firm will be merging with
Central Cement Corp., with Bacnotan as the surviving entity.

Index stock Ayala Land gained 3.08% to P33.50. The firm will list
additional shares totalling 692.53 million to cover its 50% stock
dividend. Listing of the shares will be on Sept. 24.

Filinvest Land eased 4.26% to P9, same with Fil-Estate Land, 2.11% to
P23.25. New listing Ever Gotesco slid 1.69% to P1.16. Uniwide Holdings
remained at P5.30. Solid Group eased 1.64% to P6.00.

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources orders Cebu chemical firm to cease
operations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Digna B. Verbo-Velasco

Cenapro Chemical Corp. has to stop operations as the Pollution
Adjudication Board (PAB) of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) recently upheld its earlier decision to slap a cease
and desist order (CDO) against the firm.

PAB ruled Cenapro's plant in Cebu had continuously violated
Presidential Decree 984, otherwise known as the Anti-Pollution Law, by
emitting smoke which failed DENR's opacity standard.

PAB had issued the first CDO on the project in February 1993.

Cenapro immediately filed a motion for reconsideration, seeking a
temporary lifting order (TLO) to enable it to rehabilitate
anti-pollution devices.

PAB granted a 90-day TLO 16 days afterwards on condition Cenapro would
rehabilitate anti-pollution devices, pay the performance bond, and
adopt interim remedial measures to minimize pollution.

The TLO also directed DENR Region 7 to serve the order and monitor the
Cenapro's compliance.

Almost three and half years have passed since PAB issued the first TLO
and DENR Region 7 seemed satisfied with Cenapro's compliance with TLO
conditions.

DENR Region 7's recent inquiry, however, showed Cenapro's operations
continued to cause air pollution.

DENR Central Office and PAB concluded Cenapro's "management showed
unwillingness to comply with their commitments... and is deliberately
not complying and has no intention to comply with pollution laws."

PAB promptly ruled Cenapro's defiance merited reimposition of the
original CDO and corresponding fines on Cenapro.

But a source said the "ample time" PAB had given the firm to rectify
its systems may have demonstrated PAB's own "administrative lapses."

New beach resort and golf course to rise in Cebu

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Dirk J. Barreveld

CEBU CITY - San Remegio town, a small fishing and farming community 110
kilometers away from here, may soon sport a world-class beach resort
and golf course.

Lars Lofgren, chairman of Sun Reno Development Corp. which will start
this project by early next year, said the other day it will take his
firm three years to complete the project.

San Remegio's beach had been inaccessible due to bad roads, until an
Asian Development Bank-funded project had modernized the main road. Mr.
Lofgren said his firm envisions the Sun Reno Golf and Country Club to
attract international visitors, mainly from Europe, and to provide
employment for at least 1,000 local residents. This project includes a
350-room hotel, 150 bungalows, a marina, a beach park and swimming
pools.

The project is still waiting for the Environment Management Bureau to
issue its environment compliance certificate.

San Remegio mayor Artemio Masbate said the San Remegio municipal
council has already endorsed the project. The council has also issued a
resolution converting the site from agricultural to a tourism area.
This is the second tourism project in the area to avail of the
three-year tax holiday the municipal government grants to locators with
capital of at least P5 million.

But observers are cautious, saying this project will succeed only if
plans were well prepared.

They recalled the case of Cebu Green Island, a Japanese investment
group that established a similar facility in Badian on Cebu's west
coast. This project halted after only a few years of operation due to
financial difficulty. San Remegio residents have urged their municipal
council to ensure Sun Reno's project will be properly constructed and
managed.

Gov"t fails to stop illegal quarrying in Or. Mindoro

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Grave V. de Guzman

Government officials may have allowed illegal quarrying to continue
along the coast of barangay San Antonio, Gloria in Oriental Mindoro.

"Residents of the area have asked their local officials to act on the
matter but... quarrying operations continue. In fact, hollow blocks
molding is also done in the area," Demokratikong Kilusang Magbubukid ng
Pilipinas (DKMP) president Jaime Tadeo told BusinessWorld yesterday.

He said the Mining Act of 1995 prohibits quarrying within 200 meters
from the shoreline because this causes erosion.

Mr. Tadeo said quarrying in the area which began in 1991 has adversely
affected coconut farms. He said these operations have uprooted at least
100 coconut trees.

Mr. Tadeo claimed poor enforcement of the law by the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and "connivance" of local
officials and the Philippine National Police (PNP) had allowed the
quarry's owner to proceed with operations.

"To stop quarrying activities and to confiscate pay loaders and trucks,
DENR Region 4 should order community environment and natural resources
officers to coordinate with the PNP," Mr. Tadeo said.

He also claimed Mr. Capistrano was able to secure permit to operate
from erring local government officials. He explained only local
government units can grant permits to quarry in areas measuring less
than five hectares.

DKMP has asked DENR to investigate this matter.

Fishkill hounds Hopewell plant

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 7

By Miguel M. Cortez

PAGBILAO - Seventy hectares of mangrove became a deathbed for schools
of fish when toxic liquid burst from walls of an ash lagoon of a
coal-fired power plant here last August 30.

A source at the site told BusinessWorld a breach in the dike of ash
lagoon number two of the 700-megawatt $850-million plant here of
Hopewell Power (Phils.) Corp. was responsible for the death of such
varieties as lapu-lapu, banak and samaral. This plant, which is the
country's biggest coal-fired thermal power plant, forms part of the
15-year power development program of the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

The source said plant workers had repaired the breach, which measured
five meters long and five m. deep, after gathering the dead fish. One
worker who cooked some of the lapu-lapu refrained from eating more,
saying the meat tasted "like mud."

Plant station manager George Markin declined to be interviewed, saying
he was not in a position to answer inquiries on the accident.

BusinessWorld called offices of the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources and Hopewell in Manila but their officers were all
attending meetings. One Napocor official, who requested anonymity,
tried to distance Napocor from this issue, saying Hopewell's Pagbilao
plant had begun operations only last June and that Napocor was supposed
to only monitor the plant's operations.

But the same plant's test run in September last year had reportedly
resulted in a fishkill in the area. The Quezon provincial board, which
then attributed the fishkill to the plant's allegedly indiscriminate
dumping of toxic waste in nearby waters, passed a resolution two months
later threatening to close down the plant should inquiries prove the
plant's adverse impact on the environment.

Plant officials had then denied responsibility for the reported
fishkill, saying the plant observed environment laws. One official
said, for instance, the plant's environment compliance certificate
allowed Hopewell to convert the affected mangrove into an ash lagoon.

The same official said a tripartite monitoring group meets every month
to scrutinize the plant's activities, including those related to
anti-pollution efforts. But BusinessWorld discovered the group, which
used to meet at the Pagbilao town hall, has not convened for several
months now.

Pagbilao councilor Jimmy Zaporteza, former chairman of the
multisectoral Buklod Pagbilao which opposes the plant, noted only Mayor
Conrado de Rama represented the municipal government in the monitoring
group. Mr. Zaporteza also scored the group's lack of transparency in
conducting its meetings.

Bear Stearns urges gov"t to issue new money bonds

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Maricris C. Carlos

Anticipating continued strength in investors' appetite for the
country's new uncollateralized bonds, a global investment bank has
urged government to invest in New Money Bonds (NMB), said to be
higher-yielding than local bonds.

In a recently released paper, New York-based Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc.
said it foresees yield from the Philippines' Brady bond swap to be at
par with the Eurobonds issued by the National Power Corp. (Napocor).

"Assuming the Philippines succeeds in completing its bond exchange,
there should be a convergence between yields on the remaining Brady
bonds and the (existing) sovereign-rated euro issues," Bear Stearns
said.

Earlier, Napocor issued about $100-million Eurobonds to bankroll its
infrastructure projects. The bonds were guaranteed by the National
Government.

Eurobonds are corporate or government-denominated bonds sold in a
currency other than the national currency of the issuer.

The US investment bank said investors should be offered to buy NMBs
which is seen to have a higher cash flow yield than Napocor at 9% in
2002. On the other hand, it admitted NMBs have "shorter average life."

An NMB is a type of debt instrument issued by government in the 80s to
generate additional funding for government projects.

Early this month, government announced it will retire $1.9 billion of
its Brady bonds by swapping them with new debt.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said government plans to issue
at least $200 million of 20-year fixed-rate and $200 million of 15-year
floating-rate bonds.

The Philippines has set a 7% US Treasury benchmark rate to be used in
determining the price and yields of the bond swaps, arranger J.P.
Morgan yesterday said.

The rate gives the 2017 bond exchange a yield of 8.3% on a price of
$823.43 per $1,000 of principal. The 2018 exchange bond yield is also
8.3% on a price of $827.18 per $1,000 principal amount. The minimum
fixed rate bond exchange yield is 9.25%.

The bond swap was developed based on a model set by Mexico, the first
to use the so-called Brady plan to restructure defaulted commercial
debt in 1989. Mexico was also the first to swap Bradys for new bonds.

The scheme removes US Treasuries as collateral and allows yield-hungry
investors to obtain straight exposure to the economy and their
high-yielding assets.

International credit rating agencies Duff & Phelps and Standard &
Poor's have assigned a "BB" rating to the bonds, to be issued in
exchange for the Brady Par Bonds, Series A and B.

Government is offering 15-year floating rate bonds and 20-year fixed
rate bonds, with interest yields to be fixed on September 18. With the
move, it also hopes to reduce by 17% the country's outstanding debt
stock. - with report from Reuter

Gov"t to rely more on foreign loans

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

So as not to crowd out the private sector, the government is leaning
more on foreign borrowings rather than domestic loans.

Budget Secretary Salvador Enriquez Jr. yesterday said the move is meant
to give the private sector increased access to domestic credit and, in
the process, lower interest rates.

He said the change is a "desirable" action since the government will
not crowd out private firms tapping domestic funds.

With the government's limited presence in the domestic loan market,
interest rates are expected to go down which will allow more private
corporations to access additional funds for expansion.

Data submitted by the Department of Budget and Management show the
government in the last three years had been dependent on domestic
borrowings.

In 1994, it borrowed P668 billion from local sources. This increased to
P724 billion in 1995 and P777 billion in 1996. Projected domestic debt
for 1997 is P820 billion.

Foreign debt in 1994 was P397 billion, but dipped to P390 billion in
1995 and P377 billion in 1996. It is expected to further decrease to
P368 billion next year.

Budget assistant secretary Narcisa Santos told a Senate budget hearing
the government intends to bridge the gap between the growth of foreign
loans and domestic borrowings.

"Local borrowings (by the government) really crowd out the private
sector for available credit," she said.

Mr. Enriquez said foreign borrowings would be more beneficial to the
country since these have lower interest rates.

Next year, interest payment on the total foreign loans is pegged at
P74.2 billion while principal amortization is placed at P43.5 billion.

Total borrowings for 1997 are placed at P1.18 trillion composed of P820
billion of domestic loans and P377 billion of foreign borrowings.

Mr. Enriquez said the country will have to continue its dependence on
borrowings despite the existence of the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
scheme meant to increase private sector participation in economic
building.

He said the BOT "can only go so far" and could not be solely relied on
by the government. "We need to unify everything, borrowings, savings
and BOT."

He added there's no need to worry about the balance of payments since
the government has a "good standing" with almost P5 billion.

He pointed out the public and legislators need not worry about the
government's possible abuse of getting loans since there is a law which
limits foreign borrowings to $10 billion at any given time.

Public sector surplus hits P14 billion in first half

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

Improved revenue performance enabled the government to realize a
surplus of P14.1 billion in its consolidated public sector financial
position (CPSFP) in the first half of 1996, data from the Department of
Finance (DoF) show.

A year ago, a surplus of P4.1 billion was recorded.

The consolidated public sector balance represents the fiscal position
of the National Government, including its agencies and
"instrumentalities."

The DoF cited increased tax collection as well as improved performance
by other monitored public sector entities - the Social Security System
(SSS), the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the Bangko
Sentral, government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCC), and
government financial institutions (GFI).

According to the DoF, a major factor is the P9.7-billion fiscal surplus
enjoyed by the National Government during the period.

The bulk of the surplus came from the Bureau of Customs, which exceeded
its programmed collection by P3 billion.

Improved net cash flows amounting to P8.3 billion from the SSS and the
GSIS also contributed, as well as the net income of the Bangko Sentral
of P5.5 billion.

The net income of GFIs amounting to some P2.7 billion as well as the
lower-than-programmed deficit incurred by monitored GOCCs helped.

The DoF expected GOCCs to incur a deficit of P10.96 billion but the
actual figure registered was just P9.15 billion.

Finance Secretary Roberto F. de Ocampo said "the surplus generated by
the consolidated public sector has helped dampen inflation and interest
rates."

From 11.8% in March, inflation dropped to 7.9% in August. The
bell-weather 91-day Treasury bill rate also declined from 13.2% last
May to 11.3% in yesterday's auction.

"These developments will help boost the country's growth performance to
the higher range of 7% to 7.5% during the year," he added.

Although the Finance chief sees "an acceleration of infrastructure
spending" during the rest of the year, he said this is not expected to
erode the surplus.

The government is eyeing a zero CPSD for next year.

Huge CPSD had handicapped the Philippine economy for almost two decades
due to the dismal performance of GOCCs and GFIs, which in the past have
transferred liabilities to the National Government.

Earlier, Mr. de Ocampo warned the country faces a P14-billion deficit
in its CPSFP next year if Congress fails to pass the controversial
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP).

He said there's that danger considering no firm alternatives have been
identified on where the government should source the P13.6 billion it
expects to forgo without the CTRP.

Malacanang to "force" version of "sin" taxes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Ronald F. Jabal, Paul N. Villegas and Jemileen U. Nuqui

Malacanang will force its hand and play hard ball when the proposed
excise taxes on "sin" products reach the bicameral conference
committee. And, eventually, it will win.

A high-ranking leader of the House of Representatives, who requested
not to be named, told BusinessWorld Malacanang is not willing to settle
for anything less than what was agreed on in a recent
Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC).

In his weekly press conference yesterday, President Ramos expressed
optimism the Senate will fine-tune Malacanang's version of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP) when it starts to tackle the
excise portion passed last week by the House of Representatives.

Mr. Ramos said he is banking on the Senate to come up with a better
version of the excise tax system.

"The Senate still has to put out its own version... They (Senate)
cannot go ahead of the House when it comes to tax or revenue
appropriation measures. But now that they have it, then they can go on
putting their own revisions," Mr. Ramos said.

The Ramos government is pushing for a specific tax scheme for "sin
products" under the excise tax portion of the CTRP, which is expected
to generate an annual revenue collection of P13 billion. The Budget
department has incorporated this projected figure in its 1997 budget.

Should the Senate pass a version different from that of Malacanang, Mr.
Ramos said he will remind both Chambers of their promise to harmonize
their versions during the bicameral conference committee.

Malacanang is counting on the promises made by Senate ways and means
committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile and finance committee chief
Ernesto Maceda to pass the version that will generate the most revenues.

LEDAC members earlier agreed to support an outright shift to specific
tax from the present ad valorem tax on both beer and cigarettes.
However, the Lower House "selectively" followed the agreement. It
approved a shift to specific tax on beer products while it approved a
"de facto" ad valorem tax on cigarettes.

This alarmed the Palace, the source said. If the Senate does not
deliver, the Executive is left with no recourse but to "force its hand"
in the bicameral conference committee, the House source said. "It will
strongly lobby for the passage of a specific tax on all sin products...
Eventually, the President's word will prevail," he said.

The source referred to a letter of Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo
to the House leadership dated May 29, a copy of which was obtained by
BusinessWorld, to bolster his claims. He said Mr. de Ocampo asked the
House Majority Leader, Isabela Rep. Rodolfo Albano, to help in the
passage of a version as close as possible to the Finance department's
proposal and a formula "that the President can accept."

The DoF-backed formula calls for a specific tax as the basis for
computing and assessing tax liability. However, a quarterly computation
of tax liability on an ad valorem basis by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue via market sampling at the retail level will also be
undertaken. Should the ad valorem computation result in a higher tax
take for the government, the difference would be treated as an
additional tax liability.

The source quoted the Finance official as saying, "We must endeavor to
pass a version that adheres as closely as possible to the main elements
of the (DoF formula) and that the President can accept," he said.

"This only means Malacanang will not accept anything that does not
conform with its formula...We can expect then a 'seen' hand in the
(bicameral conference committee discussions)," the source said.

This has always been the fear of Makati Rep. Joker Arroyo who said
whatever legislation Congress approves is always mangled in the
bicameral conference committee. "It (bicameral conference committee)
has become a modern-day Frankenstein," he said. However, he is hoping
House committee on ways and means chairman Antique Rep. Exequiel Javier
does not renege on his commitment not to allow anybody to mangle the
House version.

This developed as House Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. yesterday
instructed the ways and means committee to fast-track the consideration
of the last component of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package - the
income tax reforms and the tax administration reforms.

He sought the immediate passage of the tax measure increasing the
exemption of wage earners and exempting families living below the
poverty line and overseas contract workers from paying income tax.

The CTRP calls for an increase of exemption to a uniform P20,000 from
the present P9,000 for single individuals, P12,000 for heads of the
family and P18,000 for married individuals.

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader San Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora yesterday
pushed for an increased income tax exemptions for separated women and
single parents. He, however, failed to state up to what level the
increase in exemptions should be. At present, single parents can claim
only a P12,000 deduction as head of the family. He also called for the
exemption of the first P150,000 annual income of couples with four
dependents.

In a related development, the approval of the proposed P476.2-billion
national budget for next year will not be delayed even if the CTRP is
not in place, said Senate Majority Leader Alberto Romulo.

He said Congress can deliberate on the budget and the CTRP at the same
time since the two measures "go together."

Sen. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, economic affairs committee chairman,
added Congress can approve the budget based on projected revenues.

She told BusinessWorld legislators do not expect any delay in the
passage of the 1997 budget because Congress or the Executive can
exercise the authority to cut expenditures.

Mr. Romulo said both Houses have enough time to approve the CTRP and
the budget as long as solons have political will.

"Since the budget relies on revenues, the two proposals go together and
will be passed on time," he added.

FOCUS: Computerized elections: Room for improvement

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 1

By Veronica C. Silva

First of two parts

All eyes were focused on the elections in the Autonomous Region for
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) last Sept. 9. Though the region represents less
than 3% of the country's total voting population, the elections were of
national importance.

Some say for newly proclaimed governor Nur Misuari, who ran
unchallenged, last week's elections were a baptism of fire: a test of
whether or not the Moro National Liberation Front's covenant with the
government heralds the coming of peace in the region. If the reports of
election-related violence were used as a measuring stick, he would pass
with flying colors. Both the Commission on Elections (Comelec) and the
National Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel) reported "minor"
incidents of such violence, even describing the ARMM elections as
"boring" and "dull."

Equally significant is that the computerized election system the
government is planning for the national polls in 1988 was pilot-tested
in ARMM. Republic Act No. 8046, enacted in June 1995, authorized the
pilot testing of the system which will facilitate the holding of clean,
honest and orderly elections.

Almost all those who closely monitored the ARMM elections agree the
pilot test was successful in terms of speeding up the counting and
canvassing of votes. Mr. Misuari and his running mate, Guimid Matalam,
were proclaimed winners after 48 hours. But, then again, they needed
only one vote each to win since there were no other candidates.

There is still room for improvement, said Rizal Rep. Emigdio S.
Tanjuatco, Jr., chairman of the House of Representatives committee on
suffrage and electoral reforms, and a member of the pilot-test
oversight committee.

"The automated counting system, which minimized almost to nil human
intervention and then speeded up the counting, really addresses the
problem of dagdag-bawas - the manipulation or falsification of election
returns and statement of votes," he told BusinessWorld. "However, the
functioning of the (counting) machine can stand some improvements." He
also sees the need to streamline procedures.

Some of the problems observed during the pilot test, such as wet
ballots, were not technology-related but nonetheless affected the
performance of the machines.

Much is expected from the computerization of elections, but many agree
the electoral system needs more than a technological face-lift. While
technology helps automate some steps, relying on it to solve
election-related problems is only accomplishing half the task.

The project to computerize elections has had its share of criticisms.
Issues such as the high cost involved, voters' attitude and security
risks were raised.

When RA 8046 was enacted last year, the next task was to look for the
appropriate technology to do the job.

During the tenure of Comelec chairman Christian Monsod, consultants
from the information technology (IT) industry, local and foreign, were
tapped to evaluate the available technology.

But when current chairman Bernardo P. Pardo took over, the Comelec did
the evaluation itself. Executive director Resurreccion Z. Borra said
the poll body even insisted on its independence from the National
Computer Center, an agency under the Office of the President.

For its purposes, Comelec chose the American Information Systems, Inc.
(AIS) counting machine which uses an optical scanning device to "read"
the ballots fed from a paper tray.

Comelec acquired 40 units of the AIS Model 150 which can read 150
ballots per minute.

The machine eliminates problems related to erroneous entries in vote
tallying since little human intervention is involved, said Alwin S.
Sta. Rosa, Comelec director for Management Information Systems.

In the ARMM elections, one counting machine was provided for every two
municipalities. Only authorized personnel were allowed to operate it.
It recorded the number of votes counted in a 3.5" diskette. A printer
produced a hard copy and this document was used by the Namfrel in
conducting an unofficial tally of the votes through its Akbay Bilang
Center.

The Comelec used a personal computer (PC) to consolidate municipal
results and produce the provincial count. A computer program developed
by AIS - Election Reporting System (ERS) - was used to consolidate the
votes. A hard copy of the results was also produced.

One of the major issues raised about the computerization of elections
was security.

Namfrel's earlier concern was the use of the 3.5" diskette, fearing
that since this diskette is commercially available, it is easy to
switch diskettes and tamper with the data.

RA 8046 specifies the use of "memory packs," in this case, a diskette,
to store data or the election tally.

Comelec officials assured security measures were put in place to
guarantee the sanctity of the ballot.

Mr. Sta. Rosa said each diskette was pre-coded and encrypted to ensure
no switching would go undetected by the system. Should the PC user
insert a diskette whose code could not be read, the computer program
will reject it. Should diskette switching take place, the results will
be invalidated.

Should this happen, whether or not special elections would be allowed
is not yet clear.

Comelec officials said the computer printouts provide the audit trails
for the new system. Officials said should there be a discrepancy
between the diskette and the printout, the latter will be used as the
official document.

In an interview before the ARMM elections, Mr. Borra told BusinessWorld
Comelec personnel anticipated bad weather and the lack of
transportation as potential problems. Some areas in Marawi City and
Tawi-Tawi, for example, are 18 to 20 hours away from the provincial
capital where the counting machines are located. He said these could
delay the centralized counting of the votes.

Mr. Borra also then said some ballots to be transported across the seas
have to be carefully handled because if these get wet, the counting
machine would not be able to read them. Mr. Sta. Rosa, on the other
hand, assured the Comelec staff were prepared for possible technical
problems, saying technicians were trained to do troubleshooting on
site. He added that should one counting machine bogs down, there were
backup machines.

More than one counting machine and PC were located in a provincial
counting center where the votes were to be consolidated. Lanao, the
largest voting province in the region, had the most number of machines
at 19, Mr. Sta. Rosa said.

No matter how prepared the Comelec and its deputies were, the ARMM
pilot project was beset by problems, many of which were not
technology-related.

With the new technology, the Comelec projected the voter turnout at the
ARMM elections at between 80% and 85%. Mr. Borra said the commission
was hoping the voters would go out and vote, the new system
guaranteeing the security of their ballots. However, over a week has
passed and the Comelec still has to announce the official voter
turnout. Mr. Borra said the earliest the Comelec can announce the
official number is tomorrow.

Counting in some areas has been quite slow because of moist ballots
which could not be fed to the counting machine.

Mr. Tanjuatco observed humidity caused the ballots to stick together,
causing frequent paper jams.

"If this happens often, then your rate per minute will go down instead
of attaining 150 ballots per minute," the solon said.

Moisture from heavy rains and turbulent seas seeped into the windows of
the ballot boxes, noted Mr. Borra. Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao
experienced heavy rains on election day and the first day of counting.
The ballots had to be dried first before these could be fed to the
machines.

Mr. Borra said the Comelec had wrapped the ballots with cellophane or
plastic before distribution to polling centers but they still got wet.
For the next elections, he suggested windowless ballot boxes or other
protective covering to better protect the ballots.

Another problem noted was the long queues both at the polling centers
and the reception areas for the ballot boxes. For this, Namfrel
chairman Jose S. Concepcion, Jr. blamed "controls in the bureaucracy."

He said some election officials did not know Namfrel volunteers were to
be given copies of the printout for the group's quick count. Some
election officials insisted on the bureaucratic procedure: some asked
their supervisors for permission while others insisted they compile the
printout before giving Namfrel the copies. He said this defeated the
whole purpose of conducting a quick count.

Mr. Concepcion also mentioned an election official putting all copies
of the printout inside the ballot box. Under RA 8046, the copies of the
printout should be distributed to the majority and minority parties and
the election officer. Only one copy of the printout and the diskette go
into the ballot box.

Members of the Board of Election Inspectors were required to sign the
printout. However, Mr. Concepcion noticed the signatures were mere
formalities because the teachers who were supposed to witness the
functioning of the machine do not appear to be computer literate. They
did not know whether there were any errors in the procedures.

Mr. Concepcion also related that when the counting machine bogged down,
one of the board of election inspectors, a teacher who was assigned to
the machine, cannot or maybe has forgotten how to operate it. This
confusion contributed to the long lines outside the counting centers,
he said.

Technical problems compounded by bad weather delayed the regional
canvass of the ARMM elections.

The regional board of canvassers, headed by Mr. Borra, convened at the
Comelec office in Manila on Sept. 10, but no certificates of canvass
and diskettes arrived until early the following day. Mr. Borra,
however, expected this, saying the board was supposed to consolidate
the results as soon as the diskettes arrived.

Mr. Borra said these problems were anticipated and did not affect the
schedule of the counting and proclamation. He said Messrs. Misuari and
Matalam were proclaimed governor and vice-governor of ARMM on Sept. 11,
still within the 48-hour schedule the poll body has set. The 21
assemblymen for the seven districts of ARMM were all proclaimed two
days after.

Without the computerized system, observers said it could have taken
more than a week to complete the canvass of votes for a region with
close to a million registered voters like ARMM.

FVR denies involvement in Charter changes plan

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

President Ramos is keeping his distance from recent moves in the House
of Representatives to amend the Constitution to allow him to extend his
term beyond 1998.

During his weekly press conference yesterday, Mr. Ramos denied changing
his mind on the matter.

"My position is that my time, the time of the people, the time of
Congress, the time of all responsible Filipinos should be devoted to
getting our legislative program finished so that we shall have a
sustainable economic development," he said.

The Chief Executive said recent moves in the Lower House to change the
Constitution is not the sole domain of lawmakers belonging to the
administration party Lakas-NUCD. He noted a Nacionalista Party
congressman from Iloilo is one of the main proponents of Charter
changes.

"If some Lakas are involved there, they are just supporting or
responding or reacting to earlier initiatives by some members of
Congress," Mr. Ramos said.

The President has repeatedly said he will not seek reelection when his
term expires in 1998.

But he dismissed the possibility that Lakas will institute disciplinary
actions against partymates who continue to initiate moves in amending
the Charter.

"These are not criminally punishable acts on the part of the party
members," he said.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Jose de Venecia yesterday said the House
leadership does not support plans to amend the 1987 Constitution.

"It has been put in the back burner and it will remain there," said Mr.
de Venecia in a statement.

But Lakas-NUCD party whip for Mindanao and Bukidon Rep. Jose Zubiri
confirmed that several congressmen are soliciting public support for
the plan to amend the Constitution.

Meanwhile, Malabon-Navotas Rep. Tessie Aquino Oreta challenged her
colleagues and President Ramos to enter into a written "covenant" with
the people that they will all step down in 1998.

"If the President cannot accept the challenge of showing sincerity on
his pronouncements that he will give up Malacanang in 1998, we, in the
Lower House, should show the way that Malacanang may follow our
example," she said.

Gov"t consultants get P700,000 monthly

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Senators were asked yesterday to check on the reported hiring of
foreign consultants at very high salaries by several government
agencies. Senator Juan Flavier yesterday said it is necessary to look
into the situation since the fees, which range between P300,000 and
P700,000 per month for every consultant, appears questionable. "We may
not have all the expertise for government programs but I find it hard
to accept that they (foreign consultants) are being paid so much," he
said. Data from the office of the senator showed a foreign consultant
in the Health department received as much as P700,000 per month
excluding per diems and travel allowances. A consultant of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), meanwhile,
receives a monthly salary of P390,000. In another DENR project, 116
foreign consultants were hired on "call basis" with salaries ranging
from P2,000 to P9,000 a day. A project to rehabilitate Pasig River
allotted P30 million for the salaries of six consultants or P5 million
per consultant for the entire program. Mr. Flavier said the practice of
hiring foreign consultants has to be regulated because it could lead to
abuse and misspending. "We need a clear government policy on this
matter." He disclosed the agencies should not hire consultants left and
right since the money, usually loans, utilized for projects has to be
repaid by the government.

Dept of Health warns hospitals on wastes

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Government and private hospitals are in for a rough time once the
health department finds out which ones are not complying with proper
waste management disposal practices. Health Secretary Carmencita
Reodica yesterday issued a stern warning to erring hospital
administrations that their service licenses will be revoked should they
fail to meet the minimum requirements set for sanitation facilities. In
a briefing with reporters, Ms. Reodica stressed the importance of a
hospital incinerator as part of the overall health program of the
country. However, due to the high cost of purchasing an incinerator,
the lady chief said hospitals should instead encourage a waste
management disposal networking scheme wherein groups of hospitals may
avail of the services of a common contractor. An incinerator costs
about P4 million. Based on a 1994-1995 report of the Environmental
Health Services of the Department of Health (DoH), majority of the 45
government hospitals failed to meet the requirements for sanitation
facilities. It likewise revealed that hospital personnel practices on
hospital waste management is "far from ideal." Of the 45 hospitals,
only six have their own incinerators: National Kidney Institute, San
Lazaro Hospital, Philippine Heart Center, National Center for Mental
Health, Vicente Sotto Hospital in Davao and Cullon Hospital in Palawan.
Private hospitals with incinerators are East Avenue Medical Center,
Rizal Medical Center, Orthopedic Hospital and Jose Fabella Memorial
Hospital.

Charge corrupt prosecutors, public urged

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Justice Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. yesterday urged the public to
file formal complaints against corrupt prosecutors. This is after the
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) promised to submit a
list of corrupt prosecutors to the justice department yesterday. Mr.
Guingona also asked the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to look
into reports that "fix-cals" abound, particularly in the provinces.
Meanwhile, DILG Secretary Robert Barbers yesterday asked Mr. Guingona
to take action against two prosecutors who allegedly mishandled two
cases. Mr. Barbers said Quezon City assistant prosecutor Hilda
Fantastico-Ibuyan issued "a highly irregular and contradictory
resolution" in the extortion case against a policeman. Also irregular
was the dismissal by Pasig City prosecutor Eduardo R. Garcia of the
case against a suspected drug dealer operating in the Taguig, he said.
But Mr. Guingona said the DILG should first submit evidence against
prosecutors Ibuyan and Garcia before he can order an investigation.
Meanwhile, Mr. Barbers also requested Chief Presidential Legal Counsel
Renato Cayetano to ask the Supreme Court to review the life
imprisonment penalty imposed by a Manila court Monday on Malaysian drug
trafficker Allan Khor Monday. The DILG chief said the convict should
have been sentenced to death. Also yesterday, he directed Police Chief
Supt. Reynaldo Wycoco to check on the issuance of a firearm to Khor by
the Police Firearms and Explosives Division (FED). The convict is an
illegal alien, thus he cannot be granted a license to own and carry a
firearm, said Mr. Barbers.

Washington has expressed its appreciation to the Ramos government's
contribution to the conviction in New York in September 5 of terrorists
Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, Abdul Hakim Murad, and Wali Khan Amin Shah. In a
letter to President Ramos, US ambassador to the Philippines Thomas
Hubbard congratulated Philippine law enforcement agencies for their
close cooperation which led to the expeditious resolution of the
criminal cases filed against the three terrorists in New York. Mr.
Yousef and his two companions were found guilty by a US court for
plotting to bomb American airlines. The other convicted terrorists were
arrested by law enforcers in Manila in January 1995 while Yousef fled
to Pakistan where he was later arrested. "We look forward to continuing
this cooperation," Mr. Hubbard wrote in his letter.

President Ramos yesterday approved the request of the Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) for more time to revaluate bids submitted
by three port container firms for the development and operation of the
container terminal at the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. The SBMA was
supposed to have come out with its decision on the winning bidder
yesterday. It sued for more time given difficulties in evaluating bids.
The SBMA was earlier ordered to reevaluate the bids of International
Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI), Hutchison Ports Philippines,
Inc. and Royal Ports Services, Inc. after ICTSI questioned the award of
the contract to Hutchison despite having made the highest bid.

Gov"t not to blame for dike breach - DPWH

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar yesterday said government
engineers who designed the P1.4-billion Pampanga megadike should not be
blamed for breaches in the structure. He instead pointed to private
contractor Altantic Erectors, Inc. which he accused of failing to
follow government specifications of the engineers while building the
structure. "There must be proof that the design is wrong. We don't feel
these people (in DPWH) have to be convicted," said Mr. Vigilar in a
Senate hearing. The megadike was designed the Bureau of Designs of the
Department of Public Works and Highways. He said the DPWH would admit
responsibility for faulty design only if specifications were met and
the dike still collapsed.

Police bikes for APEC security defective

Police officials allegedly purchased 30 defective Kawasaki 750 cc
motorcycles for security escorts during the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) meeting in November, said a source at the Traffic
Management Command (TMC) yesterday. Motorcycle policemen are
complaining of defective clutches, oil leaks, loose screws, loose
blinkers and weak sirens, the source said. Also, the motorcycles are
only for hobbyists and are not suited for patrolling streets. "It looks
like the manufacturer just added police accessories to the P225,000
bike," the source said. The police spent in June an estimated P6.8
million for the bikes, including helmets which did not pass police
specifications.

Nothing final on gov"t-Moro Islamic Liberation Front talks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

There is nothing final with the planned peace negotiations between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said President
Ramos during his weekly press conference yesterday.

Also, a ceasefire agreement between the two is not expected to be
signed today.

Mr. Ramos said negotiations with the MILF, a splinter group of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), are being coursed through back
channels since the government has yet to map out formal talks.

"What we are doing now is preliminary talks through the back channel,
nothing official. But I can assure you that there is a lot of friendly
back channeling efforts being done by peace advocates as well as local
officials," he said.

The Chief Executive also said the government's peace strategy with the
MILF is similar with its strategy with the MNLF.

"Of course, we hope that one with the MILF will not last that many
months or years. After all, we have started already with the MNLF. The
difference, however, between formal talks or negotiating talks must be
made," Mr. Ramos said.

The MILF has been critical against the government's peace accord with
the MNLF, particularly on the creation of the Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), which will oversee peace and
development projects in 14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.

It may be noted the MILF wants complete autonomy for Mindanao.

Mr. Ramos also said he has issued a memorandum on the creation of a
special task force to oversee peace negotiations with the MILF and
other enemies of the state.

Meanwhile, MNLF officials yesterday asked the Senate to conduct an
investigation into the alleged involvement of four politicians and
former military men with Christian vigilante groups in Mindanao.

This is after the MNLF accused businessmen and politicians with
business interests in Mindanao of spearheading moves against the
establishment of the SPCPD.

In a forum at Club Filipino in Greenhills, MNLF legal counsel Blo
Adiong claimed these businessmen and politicians also floated a "white
paper" which said the SPCPD will "Islamize" Mindanao.

The white paper was reportedly circulated in Zamboanga and Cotabato.

Mr. Adiong claims these politicians and businessmen "are the same
personalities that have big business in Mindanao."

Earlier, South Cotabato Rep. Daisy Avance-Fuentes, Department of
Interior and Local Government undersecretary Alvin Dans, Sultan Kudarat
Mayor Gonzalo de Pedro and former South Cotabato mayor Eddie Juanche
were named in a military report as supporters of militia groups in
Mindanao.

But Ms. Avance-Fuentes and Mr. Dans denied the allegation. Military
officials also said the report was unconfirmed.

Military and police operatives, meanwhile, are now looking into the
alleged involvement of a prominent businessmen in Zamboanga City with
the Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC).

Meanwhile, former MNLF spokesman Datu Ibrahim Uy Alhadj, now chairman
of the Bangsa Moro Holdings Inc., also said Christian militia groups
are harmless compared with the MILF and the Abu Sayyaf.

"They (militia groups) are not capable of creating violent attacks and
take arms against the government and other Muslims," he said.

Meanwhile, MNLF chairman and new Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao
(ARMM) governor Nur Misuari is expected to join negotiations with the
MNLF.

Presidential Management Staff chief Alexander Aguirre yesterday said
the MNLF will be consulted the MILF peace talks since a large
concentration of Islamic Front is in the ARMM.

Earlier, Mr. Misuari reportedly planned to distance himself from the
proposed talks, saying that is "solely the initiative of the
government."

Meanwhile, senators yesterday vowed to block the proposed P230-million
budget for the integration of MNLF members into the Philippine National
Police (PNP) unless the government can provide a clear program for
rebel disarmament.

Senate Minority Leader Edgardo Angara said the lack of a disarmament
plan for MNLF forces, particularly those excluded from the integration
scheme, is a source of apprehension among people in Mindanao.

death penalty, the Supreme Court should pass judgment on the
correctness of death sentences imposed by trial courts.

Thus recommended Jesuit priest and lawyer Joaquin Bernas,
vice-president of the 1987 Constitutional Commission, in a 23-page
memorandum submitted yesterday to the High Court.

He also asked the High Tribunal to formulate guidelines for trial
courts to follow in imposing death sentences.

The Supreme Court had asked Fr. Bernas to give his recommendations
after death row convict Pedro Malabago questioned the constitutionality
of the heinous crimes law. A lower court had sentenced Malabago to
death after it found him guilty of killing his wife.

Fr. Bernas said Congress did not violate the Constitution when it
enacted Republic Act 7659 which paved the way for the reimposition of
the death penalty by classifying several crimes as heinous. But it is
the duty of courts to examine the validity of the classification.

"The fact that Congress has listed a crime in the books as heinous does
not settle everything. Congressional definitions are not always
conclusive. It is the same when Congress labels a crime as heinous.
Crimes do not exist in books. Crime exist in life. And life is not
univocal," said Fr. Bernas.

He also said Congress did not impose the death penalty but merely
provides for a penalty which the courts, where proper, may impose.

"It is the courts which decide whether it is legally and
constitutionally proper to impose the penalty, and impose it not on an
abstract criminal coldly described in books but on warm bodied accused
individuals who possess the very fundamental and precious right to
life," he said.

Political advertising ban on showbiz folk proposed

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Media and showbiz personalities planning to run for office should take
a "leave of absence" to avoid the possible "misuse of media" by
candidates, says House Bill 7462 which will amend the law banning
political advertisements.

The bill seeks to amend the Omnibus Election Code by allowing the use
of mass media and other campaign materials by candidates running for
office.

"The bill seeks to equalize the political playing field by reducing the
undue advantage enjoyed by candidates who are media or show business
personalities ," said Rizal Rep. Emigdio Tanjuatco, Jr. in a
sponsorship speech recently.

He includes in the ban media and showbusiness personalities who are
campaigning for candidates. Mr. Tanjuatco also suggests that their
films, commercials and endorsements be banned.

This is to "level the playing field and rationalize media use," he said.

Dept of Transportation and Communication seeks more penalties for cellphone
cloning

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 8

Transport and communication officials yesterday recommended stiffer
penalties against cloning and the illegal use of frequencies.

The Department of Transportation and Communication (DoTC) as well as
the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) proposed higher fines
and longer imprisonment under the telecommunications anti-fraud bill
pending in Congress.

DoTC and NTC said the penalties for cloning should include a minimum
fine of P1 million as well as imprisonment for not less than 12 years.

Under House Bill 2430, cloning and the illegal use of frequencies are
punishable with six to eight years imprisonment or a fine of not less
than P200,000.

Transportation and Communications undersecretary Josefina T. Lichauco,
in a letter to Senator Sergio Osmena, III, chairman of the committee on
public services, said the proposed stiffer penalties were reached in
consultation with the private sector.

The Senate versions of HB 2430 are Senate Bills 1386 and 1505.

Under existing laws, cloning, subscription fraud, and other similarly
illegal acts are not considered criminal offenses.

The bills also cover illegal connections such as unreported extension
telephone lines, third number billing fraud (where a caller charges a
long distance call to a telephone number without the consent of the
owner), and destruction of telecommunication facilities like public
telephone booths.

Economic Indicator: Per capita GNP improves by 5%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Rene A. Mallari

With the economy's 7.1% growth in the first semester, real per capita
income correspondingly improved.

Data culled from the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB)
show per capita gross national product (GNP) - or the estimated income
each Filipino receives - at constant 1985 prices was placed at P5,916
in the first half of the year. This registered a 4.6% hike from P5,655
in the same period last year. A rising income means Filipinos are
better off than before.

Real per capita GNP is calculated by dividing GNP by the population
during a given period. Ideally, the output produced by the economy
should be faster than population growth. For the past two years, the
economy has been growing more than twice the population growth. In
particular, GNP expanded 5.5% in 1995 and 7.1% in the first half of
1996. Based on the 1990 Census of Population and Housing, the number of
Filipinos was estimated at 71.9 million as of the second quarter of
1996, increasing steadily by roughly 2.3% annually. Per Capita GDP

Per capita gross domestic product (GDP), on the other hand, amounted to
P5,641, up 2.6% from P5,496 the previous period. This was slightly
better than the 2.3% growth posted in 1995. Per capita GDP is deemed
more reliable measure of one's income level than per capita GNP.

The growth in per capita GDP can be traced mainly to the favorable
performance of the agricultural sector which registered a 3.8% upswing
in the first six months, or a rebound from almost 1% in the preceding
year. The NSCB reported that strong production of palay, corn and
sugarcane kept the sector moving.

However, the gap between per capita GNP and GDP during the period under
review has widened. In 1996, the difference was at P275, bigger than
P159 in 1995 and P134 in 1994. In recent years, net factor income from
abroad (NFIA) which includes remittances of overseas contract workers
(OCWs) remained a major contributor to GNP. OCW remittances have been
on an uptrend, accelerating 76.5% in the first semester.

Despite the widening gap, economists are confident per capita GDP will
soon catch up since investments have been leading local growth.

As real per capita GNP improved, purchasing power further expanded.
Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) per head was valued at P4,337,
up 2% from P4,251 the previous year. PCE refers to consumer spending
for goods and services.

PCE for the past quarters has generally slowed down. This can mean more
Filipinos have been saving or pouring their surplus funds to longer
termed investments.

Economic Indicator: Increasing number of contractors shows upbeat
construction sector

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 10

By Leotes Marie T. Lugo

Reflective of the upsurge of construction activity in the country, more
and more contractors have been granted licenses by the Philippine
Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB). In a span of five years,
population of the local contracting sector reached 8,225 or nearly
double the 5,476 registered in 1991.

Contractors are primarily responsible for gathering all the necessary
resources required in putting up the desired facility. Proponents of
the contracting sector also coordinate and supervise the entire
construction process. An increase in the number of contractors attest
to impressive showing of the industry.

PCAB is the government agency tasked to issue, limit, suspend and
revoke contractors' licenses as well as upgrade the classification of
licensed contractors. The Board issues regular and special licenses.
The first is granted to Filipino sole proprietorships, and partnerships
or corporations with at least 60% equity participation. The latter is
issued to joint ventures, consortiums, foreign constructors or a
project owner engaged in the construction of a single specific
undertaking.

Increasing disposable incomes, lower interest rates and favorable
demographics contributed to the boom in both residential and
nonresidential construction. Rising demand for support facilities in
stride with the country's economic expansion also enticed more
companies to join the real estate bandwagon.

In the first quarter alone, the sector was joined by 1,973 new approved
contractors. More than half of the total fell under category D.
Contractors are categorized with respect to their minimum capital base.
Firms under AAA have a minimum capital of P10 million; AA, P5 million;
A, P1 million; B, P500,000; C, P300,000; D, P100,000 and Trade, P5,000.

A closer look at the PCAB data show the industry is composed mainly of
small contractors. Firms under category D, C and B captured the first,
second and third places respectively, in terms of number. Even
aggregate entities under the Trade classification exceeded the combined
total of type AAA and AA contractors. Trade contractors are limited to
repair works and undertakings of up to P500,000 contract or project
cost.

Moreover, only 199 companies fell under the AAA grouping. These are the
companies capable of handling large scale projects worth P50 million
and above. Commonly referred to as the big guns in the industry, these
include D.M. Consunji Inc., EEI Corp. and F.F. Cruz and Company, Inc.,
among others.

The present composition though may prove a disadvantage to the
industry. Faced with the entry of foreign players, "local contractors
must join forces and be ready for competition," a high ranking
Philippine Constructors Association (PCA) official said.

The official further noted that joint ventures are fast becoming a
practice in the sector, which PCA hopes will lead to the formation of
consortiums and in the long run, mergers among construction companies.

Approvals of licenses is expected to be on the uptick given the
consistent positive showing of the industry, Sonia T. Valdeavilla,
Philippine Overseas Construction Board-International Projects
Monitoring Division chief told BusinessWorld in an earlier interview.

Ms. Valdeavilla pointed to the increasing government budget for
infrastructure as well as the Countryside Development Fund as
additional come-ons for construction firms. Build-operate-transfer
projects in the pipeline are estimated to cost P212.53 billion.
Likewise, the Construction Industry Authority of the Philippines (CIAP)
estimates real construction output to move up 13.5% this year and
accelerate at an annual average rate of 14% until 1998. Tourism and
real estate development are also counted on to bolster the industry's
growth.

CIAP computed real demand for construction this year to reach P99.2
billion, of which P55.8 billion will come from private construction
which covers residential and nonresidential projects. Addressing the
3.72 million housing backlog through the construction of low cost and
socialized housing will answer the demand side. Meanwhile, the growth
of urban centers and the continued development of industrial centers is
counted on to sustain the boom in the nonresidential sector.

Government construction, on the other hand accounts for P43.4 billion
of the total. This covers infrastructure development in power, energy
and electricity, transportation, water resources, social infrastructure
and communication.

Licensed contractors are further classified into general
building, general engineering and specialty contractors.
General building companies are involved in the development of a
wide range of structures and buildings. Contractors who perform
civil engineering works requiring specialized engineering such
as construction of irrigation, drainage, water supply
sewerage, flood control, highways and roads, harbors, docks and
wharves, shipyards, ports and heavy industrial establishments are
classified under general engineering. Specialty contractors are
those who undertake work requiring specialize building trades.
Majority of contractors belong to the general engineering/building
class.

DECS, DoST agency launch school, forest park program

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

Filipino schoolchildren can better appreciate the importance of
protecting the environment through a program which has been created.

Called "School Forest Park Program," it will support the government's
clean and green initiative and consequently, create consciousness among
children on the value of environment protection and conservation of its
biodiversity.

The Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and Philippine
Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and
Development (PCARRD) joined hands through a signing of the memorandum
of agreement (MoA) to fully implement the program.

Signatories to the agreement were DECS Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria and
PCARRD executive director Wlliam D. Dar. Los Banos-based PCARRD, an
agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DoST), monitors,
coordinates, and evaluates research and development (R&D) activities in
agriculture, environment, and natural resources in the country.

In the agreement, DECS will identify the area within the school
premises to be designated for the program, allocate the necessary funds
and resources, and supervise overall implementation.

PCARRD, on the other hand, will provide technical assistance to the
identified schools, help identify and source forest tree species and
materials indigenous to the area, and encourage/involve other agencies/
organization in the project.

Secretary Gloria said the new program will complement DECS's existing
"School-in-a-Garden" project.

In the last few years, specifically during the Aquino administration,
both public and private schools have strengthened their curricula by
adopting environment-related subjects.

The concept of sustainable development has also been integrated in
various subjects in both primary and secondary levels.

Driven by the global concern on environmental protection and wildlife
conservation, specifically through the Earth Summit in 1992, several
local colleges and universities are now offering special courses on
environmental management.

IT"S ONLY MONEY: Sustaining the sustainable

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Mario P. Chanco

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), like any financial institution
deserving the name, is worried. In a story bylined by BusinessWorld
reporters Maricris C. Carlos and Elisha R. Garcia earlier this week,
the IMF expressed more than a bit of curiosity about the rate of
national economic growth and wondered out loud - as anyone in their
position appears well entitled to wonder - if the Philippines had
enough growth sustainability factors to keep up with its spending.

Of course, this whole exercise is about money. It's only money.

It's money that interests the money merchants and the money spenders,
but the IMF is quoted as worried about the country's money inflows. The
bulk appears to come, not from the hot shots riding the rails on the
Bicol-North super expressways, but from overseas contract workers
(OCWs).

Either kind of legal tender will pay for life's real or imagined needs.
But when overseas income starts surging 76% higher in the first six
months of 1996 compared to that of a year ago, it's time to look at the
color of one's money.

When one considers that there has been a continuous downtrend in the
number of Filipinos employed overseas in these last years, the innuendo
turns absolutely tantalizing. One wonders: Did those overseas workers
we have left somehow marry into rich families on the desert sands? Or
is there a new kind of corporate capital sharing now at work that we
will never hear of in the country?

I remember, some five or six years ago, watching at a big Quezon City
car exchange where a transaction involving a large passenger van was
going on. The deal may have been several days in the making, but when I
chanced on the scene money was already changing hands. The buyer was a
shapely Filipina who could have been a stewardess, nurse or just an
overseas spellbinder. But she was tough and spoke in knowledgeable
Tagalese that she intended to get value for her money.

She took out so many high-denomination bills from a large suitcase I
thought she had a direct pipeline to a next-door bank. Finally, when
all the accessories, tires, papers, etc. had been dumped inside the
van, she and two other companions got in and drove away in a cloud of
dust.

At another time, I watched at a money changer's shop while two
foreigners dickered for centavos on the standard peso-dollar exchange
rate - and ended up changing $20 per head. Behind them, a short, squat
Filipino OCW walked up and waited patiently at the counter. He
deposited a thick wad of hundred-dollar bills big enough to choke a
dinosaur. He had a proper escort, this man had; when they zoomed off
into the sunset, he made the old cowboy John Wayne look Lilliputian by
comparison.

So there you have it - big bucks and big money from fewer Filipino
workers overseas. But they still float enough high-octane gas to fuel
the consumerist boom in cars, housing, food, appliances, durables. The
very breath of life, the IMF seems to say, which makes even us ask
plaintively - how long is this bubble going to last? How long before it
blows up on our faces, and another IMF set of conditions is imposed to
make Filipinos live within their means?

Filipino overseas workers, it is said, are not likely to return home
soon, so their source of funds will not be quickly cut off. So if that
is OK, what's this talk about growth sustainability all about?
Something to keep the boys better treated for all the tough years
they've been having? Or is it simply because, with so many small
Filipinos doing their bit to keep the nation afloat and sustainable, we
still need to justify ourselves before yet another level of judges?

Dept of Envt and Natural Resources okays social forestry rules

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

New rules on social forestry were approved last week by the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

Started during the early years of the Aquino administration, social
forestry was promoted as a livelihood scheme for upland communities.

The new rules, spelled out in DENR Administrative Order No. 96-24,
series of 1996, are aimed at ensuring "equitable access and sharing of
rights to natural resources development and utilization by giving the
people, particularly the poorer sectors of society, the opportunity to
participate actively in forest plantation development."

DENR will grant Socialized Industrial Forest Management Agreement or
SIFMA to qualified program participants and will include a provision on
security of tenure.

The concept was derived from the Industrial Forest Management Agreement
or IFMA which taps corporate participants.

Under the SIFMA, each family can develop and manage forest areas from 1
to 10 hectares. For associations and cooperatives, sizes of awarded
areas range from 11 to less than 500 hectares.

A non-refundable application fee of P500 for every hectare awarded will
be collected by DENR.

Filipinos of legal age and preferably residents of the municipality
where the project will be located are qualified to apply for concession
areas.

Associations and cooperatives applying should have offices located in
the province where the SIFMA is located and are duly registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Cooperative Development
Authority.

Moreover, they must be financially and technically capable of
developing the area. Applicants should not have had any agreements,
permits or licenses to use forest lands or resources cancelled due to
their inability to comply with DENR requirements nor are they holders
of any existing forest permit, license, lease or management agreement.

A qualified SIFMA applicant is entitled to the following:

* harvest, sell or use all planted crops, mostly trees for wood
production, non-timber species and other cash crops that may be
interplanted, except those retained for environmental protection;

* export logs, lumber and other forest products harvested according to
the government's allocation system;

* exemption from paying forest charges derived from the plantation;

* reasonable compensation if the SIFMA is cancelled without due cause;

* high priority if future rules allow a more permanent tenurial
arrangement;

* no restrictions on use of the SIFMA as collateral for loans to
improve the area, provided this is approved by the issuing IFMA
authority; and

* free technical assistance for SIFMA holders wanting to confederate
into a larger organization.

SIFMA is valid for 25 years and renewable for another 25 years.

DENR Secretary Victor O. Ramos said SIFMA will promote an adequate and
steady supply of timber and other forest products for the domestic and
export market; accelerate reforestation and rehabilitation of the
country's open and denuded forest lands and effectively protect and
conserve existing natural forests, soil, water and biodiversity; while
at the same time give more equitable access to forest resources and
help uplift the economic situation of people, particularly in the
uplands.

Gov"t seals wastewater tunnels of Mandaluyong sugar refinery

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 16

By Digna V. Velasco

Wastewater tunnels of a sugar refinery in Mandaluyong City were closed
last week by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).

The Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) of the DENR ruled the sealing of
the Noah's Ark Sugar Refinery's drainage tunnels with cement fillings
and steel plates.

A laboratory analysis of the refinery's wastewater showed a solid
matter density higher than what the government allows. For DENR, solid
particles emitted into a water system should take an hour to settle at
its bottom.

The closure order was first served on October 17, 1995 because Noah's
Ark failed to install an adequate wastewater treatment plant (WTP).
Five days after, the firm filed a motion for reconsideration which the
board denied for "lack of merit."

On November 22, 1995 however, a six-week temporary lifting order (TLO)
was issued but subject to three conditions including the construction
of an adequate WTP.

PAB extended the TLO for 60 days on January 24, 1996 with instructions
to the DENR-National Capital Region (DENR-NCR) to test the firm's
wastewater regularly.

On June 13, 1996, the TLO was again extended for another month "to
allow the respondent to further adjust its WTP and for resampling
purposes."

Last August 6, PAB ordered the reimposition of the standing
close-and-desist order (CDO) which was served 10 days later by DENR-NCR
officials led by Environment Management Engineer Danilo Galagnara.

They noted one of the three tunnel outfalls was below the surface of
the river so they had to come back in the afternoon at low tide to seal
it. They reported the firm's administrative manager, Luis Ramos,
prevented them from carrying out the said order.

PAB made its first endorsement to DENR Secretary Victor Ramos for the
filing of criminal charges against the firm. Last September 11, the
refinery's drainage tunnels were finally sealed.

Gerardo Reyes, Noah's Ark's public relations officer, denied some of
DENR's accusations. He told BusinessWorld that no wastewater sampling
was scheduled that last week of June when the "organic-laden
wastewater" was taken.

Instead, a DENR-NCR monitoring team went to check on the air pollution
complaints of Mandaluyong City Congressman Neptali Gonzales, Jr.
against the firm. Noah's Ark passed the air pollution test.

"Unfortunately, a companion of the team saw the wastewater flowing into
the bed which has not yet passed through our treatment plant. He took
some samples of it and had it tested. Predictably, we failed. That
became the basis of the CDO automatic reimposition," Mr. Reyes related.

Mr. Reyes claimed that Noah's Ark had an existing WTP when the CDO was
first issued. The firm had failures in operations due to a boiler
breakdown and "we can't assure a 100% operational WTP." Thus, the CDO
was issued.

The CDO was temporarily lifted with the firm subjected to close
wastewater monitoring. The refinery adopted the biological system which
used activated sludge or bacteria to eat up the wastes in the aeration
tank.

From the aeration tank, wastewater passes through the resettling tank
then finally discharged into the Pasig River.

The TLO was extended for three months so DENR could continue monitoring
the firm's improvements.

Mr. Reyes related, "DENR told us that the Biological Oxygen Demand
(BOD) level was the critical aspect so we worked on it." BOD is the
capacity of the water to supply oxygen needed by organisms to survive.

Mr. Reyes added, "We passed the required BOD but we had a high
percentage of solid particles. We were again told to improve on our
WTP."

"But we were nearing the end of the TLO extension. PAB said there is no
need for a written petition for another extension. It was then that the
unfortunate testing came, resulting in the CDO automatic reimposition."

Mr. Reyes also denied DENR's accusation that Mr. Ramos, Noah's Ark's
administrative manager, stopped the closure order.

He added that on August 21, the firm submitted another motion for
reconsideration to PAB, citing that the firm received only last July 16
the one-month TLO extension issued last June 13.

The motion argued that the TLO should have lapsed only last August 17.
The refinery also cited substantial losses due to the "outright closure
of production" as the raw sugar worth P10 million in its production
lines would be wasted.

A separate sampling and laboratory analysis of DENR's River
Rehabilitation Secretariat last July 1 showed "marked improvements,"
with the concentration of solid particles reduced significantly.

"According to our consultants, DENR's standard is based on tap water
such as that supplied by the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System.
Can that be expected of wastewater?" he asked.

The refinery has also installed a clarifier and screen to further
filter the solids before final discharge into the Pasig River.

Mr. Reyes said the management decided to voluntarily stop its
operations about a week before DENR's actual closure.

As a last resort, the firm might consider ocean-dumping as an
alternative and they have already applied to the Philippine Coast Guard
for this.

The refinery's wastewater, he said, can be good fish food since it is
mostly molasses from the sludge of sugar cane.

The firm also has its own tadpoles and barges to transport wastewater
to the sites to be identified by the Philippine Coast Guard.

But DENR authorities said this is still subject to PAB's approval and
had to be closely coordinated with the DENR-NCR officers and the
Philippine Coast Guard.

On the firm incurring losses due to the closure, PAB argued that other
firms have always raised this reason which is not enough to stay the
CDO. "Economic losses are expected in all firms meted with CDOs," the
board explained.

For Noah's Ark refinery, DENR's closure action was "counterproductive"
to President Fidel Ramos's program of Philippines 2000.

"We in the private sector are working hand in hand with the government.
But we are confused on the role of the DENR. Is it there to close down
firms?

"Shouldn't its role be in helping firms comply with its standards?
DENR's role should be a working relationship with the private sector
and not just a police body out to close firms.

"Will CDO be the remedy? We wouldn't question it if we had been
defiant. But we had spent about P5 million to improve our WTP and
comply with DENR's requirements," Mr. Reyes said.

Congress wants Pagcor to fund Oil Price Stabilization Fund

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

After the Philippine National Oil Co. (PNOC), Congress is hoping to tap
funds from last year's top earner, the state-owned Philippine Amusement
and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), to wipe out the P2.3 billion deficit of the
Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF).

Early this year, PNOC shelled out P10 billion from its coffers for the
OPSF. However, this was not enough to reimburse all pending claims of
three oil companies.

Now, Congress thinks Pagcor, which earned P5.86 billion in profits last
year, is the next potential OPSF donor.

Taguig Rep. Dante Tinga, chairman of the committee on energy at the
House of Representatives, told BusinessWorld the Lower House hopes to
settle the OPSF deficit before March 1997. This is when the government
is slated to lift all controls, including on pricing, on the oil
industry.

"There are actually many sources of funds to (address) the OPSF
deficit. But Pagcor is the most capable to provide money to the OPSF,"
he said.

Pagcor, a government-owned-and-controlled corporation which runs all
casinos nationwide, is considered the most profitable of all state-run
companies.

The three oil companies - Petron Corp., Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.
(PSPC) and Caltex (Phils.) Inc. - have turned down requests by the
Department of Energy for them to condone pending claims from the OPSF.

Their claims against the fund is estimated to have reached P2.3 billion
in August.

Officials of the oil firms earlier said they cannot write off their
claims from the buffer fund since this will affect their balance sheets
and thus hinder plans for expansion.

Of the P10 billion PNOC coughed up, only P9 billion was paid to the oil
companies. The DoE decided to keep the P1 billion as buffer fund to
cushion any oil price increase during the partial deregulation of the
oil industry.

But Energy Secretary Francisco Viray had floated the idea of using the
P1 billion, or whatever will be left of it, to pay part of the oil
firms' OPSF claims.

Mr. Tinga said the Lower House will be supportive of Mr. Viray's
suggestion although this will have to be legislated.

The OPSF is a buffer fund used to shield domestic oil prices against
radical movements in crude prices abroad and the fluctuations in the
foreign exchange rates.

The OPSF turned red in May last year given the unexpected increases in
the price of crude oil in the world market.

Even with PNOC's substantial contribution, the Energy Regulatory Board
(ERB) had to increase oil prices by an average of P0.55 per liter last
February to address part of the OPSF deficit.

Officials of the Department of Finance (DoF) said oil prices may have
to be raised by another P0.11 per liter to produce money that will be
paid to the oil companies.

The DoF said the government is cash-strapped to provide any more funds,
thus the OPSF burden has to be passed on to consumers.

National Economic and Development Authority Board approves 10 projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Ma. Salve I. Duplito

Ten projects worth P97.5 billion were approved yesterday by the
National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board.

The NEDA Board, a cabinet-level body, is chaired by President Ramos. It
gives the final approval of projects before they are carried out.

The 10 projects will cost the government P33.7 billion in local funding
and P63.3 billion in foreign loans through official development
assistance and grants.

The San Roque Multipurpose Project accounted for the biggest chunk of
the funding, costing P24.9 billion.

The site of the Multipurpose Project is the Agno River Basin in
Pangasinan. The project includes a 345-megawatt power plant and
irrigation for 70,822 hectares of agricultural land.

Documents from NEDA, however, show the project is not financially
viable but the economic rate of return to be gleaned from power
generation and irrigation is expected to make up for the financial
unviability of the project.

The Light Rail Transit III was the second biggest project, costing the
government P18.3 billion in foreign loans. Local funding is not needed
for the project as the project is identified under the
build-lease-transfer scheme.

The LRT III, which has been delayed for almost a year now because of
right-of-way and squatter relocation problems, is expected to be
completed in October next year with construction starting not later
than this month.

NEDA's Infrastructure Staff earlier questioned its viability as project
cost has ballooned to $655 million from the original $300 million. The
Department of Transportation and Communications, however, pushed hard
for the project.

The NEDA Board retained the non-separability feature of commercial
development and the train service itself which the Metro Rail Transit
Corp. (MRTC) had been proposing to remove.

The MRTC, the consortium of some of the biggest developers in the
country, earlier sought to continue with the commercial development of
the depot site in North Edsa and other sites even if the rail component
does not push through. NEDA, however, blocked the act to ensure that
LRT III construction pushes through.

The Sixth Roads Improvement Project, which will be financed mainly
through a P9.5-billion loan from the Asian Development Bank and Japan
Export Import Bank, seeks to rehabilitate the national roads network
through repairs and constructions of bridges and roads in crucial
points nationwide.

The other seven approved, with investments totalling P44 billion, are:
Third Elementary Education Projects I and II, Agrarian Reform
Communities Project, Growth with Equity in Mindanao Program, and three
power projects under the National Power Corp.

APEC UPDATE: APEC needs private sector to solve energy problem

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Leda A. Esguerra

Energy ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) urged
a tie-up between governments and the business sector to address the
region's rising power demand.

The call was contained in a declaration following a meeting in Sydney,
Australia, in preparation for this November's APEC summit in Subic.

The ministers expect a 50% to 80% increase in the region's electricity
demand from 1996 to 2010, requiring some $1.6 trillion in investment
capital.

"If such growth is to be realized, business sector finance for power
infrastructure will be essential," they said.

For a strong partnership with the business industry, the governments of
member economies need to find means to reduce investment risks for the
business community and encourage them to invest in power
infrastructure, the ministers explained.

They stressed, "APEC governments must play a catalytic role in creating
the project approval, regulatory and financial conditions necessary to
mobilize the investment capital required from the business community."

Apart from the need to introduce reforms to mobilize private sector
investments in the power sector, the ministers identified a series of
objectives they will be reporting to the APEC leaders.

The objectives are: the improvement of regional energy security by
opening up the energy markets and expanding current supply capacity and
energy conservation; the need to come up with strategic approach to
reducing the environmental impact of power projects.

Also to be reported are the need for a framework to reduce business
costs through cooperation on energy standards; and the adoption of
energy policy principles to give an impetus to regional initiatives to
reform energy policies for incorporation into domestic energy policy
deliberations of member economies.

APEC members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand
and the United States.

FVR okays blacklist rules for erring gov"t contractors

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

Erring contractors of the government's infrastructure projects will
have to shape up or else be blacklisted from future construction
projects.

The guidelines on blacklisting erring contractors were given the
Presidential nod during the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) Board meeting held yesterday.

The government intends to finalize an Executive Order (EO) by the end
of the year to implement the guidelines.

NEDA director-general Cielito F. Habito told BusinessWorld the
President bypassed the usual repetitive discussions and approved the
guidelines to fast-track the implementation of the EO.

"The President said it's about time to have a uniform set of guidelines
to weed out misfits in the government's infrastructure projects," Mr.
Habito said. Mr. Habito added, however, the President ordered several
clarifications specifically on conflicts of interest.

"Some contractors are just dummies of local government officials. We
have to set the rule on how to deal with this," the President was
quoted as saying during the meeting.

Before the State of the Nation Address last June, the President visited
the road construction at the Quezon City Circle and was reportedly
disappointed at the project's slow development.

Under the current system, agencies have different guidelines and
sanctions for erring contractors and have no common list of blacklisted
contractors.

This situation allows contractors to escape detection and repetitively
win in project biddings despite their poor performance.

In the new set of guidelines, a uniform set of guidelines and sanctions
has been set. The sanctions range from suspension to perpetual
disqualification.

Contractors can be blacklisted if proven to have used falsified
documents or borrowed license during bidding, rigging of bidding,
inability to comply with requirements like affidavits on time, delays
in construction and low quality of work.

Meanwhile, President Ramos yesterday approved the extension of the 3%
duty on portland cement until 1997 to prevent any sudden increase in
cement prices.

The decision was reached upon recommendation by the Committee on
Tariffs and Related Matters (TRM) of the NEDA Board.

The extension was one of the executive actions targetted by NEDA in its
Action Plan Against Inflation. The move is seen to dampen uptick in
cost of housing and repairs which accounts for 13.3% of inflation.

In the earlier plan, cement duty is scheduled to go up to 10% in
January 1, as mandated by Executive Order 284.

However, since the current cement shortage is expected to stretch until
1998, private sector representatives asked the government to postpone
the increase in import duty to prevent importations from being too
expensive and therefore ease cement shortage.

Data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) show demand for
cement next year will balloon to 407 million bags from 334 million this
year, even as supply is only expected to reach 401.8 million bags. This
translates to a 5.4 million supply deficit.

In 1998, the situation will even be bleaker despite the operation of
new plants, DTI said. Deficit is expected to shoot up to 42.5 million
bags.

Taxwise or Otherwise: Sellers to Philippine Economic Zone Authority firms

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 2

By Romeo B. Cruz

Sellers of goods or services dealing with an enterprise registered with
the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) are often confronted with
the issue on the proper treatment of such transaction for Value-Added
Tax (VAT) purposes. What may appear simple is complicated due to
differences in interpretation of the pertinent provisions of the VAT
Law and related legislations.

The provisions of the new VAT Law and implementing revenue regulations
on effectively zero-rated sale could have provided the ready answer.
Under the regulations, sales of goods and services by a VAT-registered
person to a person or entity who has been granted indirect tax
exemption under special laws are, in effect, zero-rated. In the
regulations and the memorandum circular, the enumeration of effectively
zero-rated sales of goods specifies sale to Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA)-and Cooperative Development Authority (CDA)-registered
enterprises, to PEZA registered enterprises, and to Asian Development
Bank and International Rice Research Institute, pursuant to respective
laws and international agreements. However, this specific reference is
not contained in the enumeration of effectively zero-rated sales of
services to these enterprises.

It is our position that while not explicitly stated, it is the intent
of the rules that sales of services to these specific enterprises and
organizations are to be treated in the same manner as the sales of
goods, and are effectively zero-rated.

The PEZA law states that all privileges, benefits, advantages or
exemptions accorded to special economic zones created under RA 7227
(e.g. SBMA and CDA) shall also be accorded to PEZA firms. One of the
privileges enjoyed by SBMA enterprises is that purchases of raw
materials, capital goods and equipment and services are considered
effectively zero-rated for VAT purposes (Sec. 4 (A) of Rev. Regs. 1-95).

Inasmuch as PEZA firms enjoy this same privilege, the sale of products
and services to PEZA firms should be treated as effectively zero-rated.
Thus, the seller is liable to zero per cent VAT on such sale and is
still entitled to claim input taxes. Since the seller will not pass on
any VAT, PEZA firms will enjoy a 10% savings on purchases made.

The seller is, however, required to submit an application for
zero-rating to the Revenue District Office having jurisdiction over its
principal place of business. Without an approved application for
zero-rating, the sale would merely be considered exempt from VAT,
therefore, the seller cannot deduct the input taxes paid on products
sold against its output VAT.

(Mr. Romeo B. Cruz is a manager at the Tax and Corporate Services
Department of Joaquin Cunanan & Co., a member firm of the Price
Waterhouse Worldwide Organization.)

Local, Japanese groups to slug it out for 20% of National Steel Corp. on
Oct. 2

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

At least 13 companies have signified their intentions to buy into the
National Steel Corp. (NSC) when the government bids out 20% of the firm
on October 2 for an expected take of not less than P4.5 billion.

The companies represented in yesterday's pre-bidding conference
conducted by the National Development Co. (NDC) include four Japanese
conglomerates, three investment affiliates representing big clients,
prominent and low-key business names.

Among the Japanese firms are Tomen Corp., Kawasho Corp., Mitsui & Co.,
Ltd. and Marubeni Corp.

ING Barings, Urban Bank and Lunar Holdings of broker Luis Virata were
also present. Sources said they could be representing big names wanting
to elude publicity.

An example could be plastics tycoon William Gatchalian who is said to
be talking intently with the Malaysian majority group in NSC for
significant exposure in the country's largest steel firm.

The interest of now Hong Kong-based Roberto Ongpin in NSC was also
confirmed with the attendance of APC Group formerly Asian Petroleum
Corp.

APC is 50-owned by Mr. Ongpin's Belle Corp. which is part of his AIA
Holdings. Talks are rife at the stock market that Mr. Ongpin will be
converting APC into a holding company which he will use to penetrate
NSC and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).

Mr. Ongpin has been eyeing the steel firm, even before the Malaysians
entered the picture. In fact, he participated in the privatization but
lost to the Malaysians. He and Mr. Gatchalian have been meeting often
with Wing Tiek Holdings Berhad for possible tie-ups, sources said.

Shipping magnate Doris Magsaysay-Ho also sent a representative through
her National Marine Corp. Other prospective bidders are Cathay Pacific
Steel Corp., another firm represented by the Embassy of Spain, current
NSC supplier Reliance Commodities and an obscure firm, Rico Enterprises.

NDC, the government's holding arm, will be dividing the 448,683,666
shares into four blocks comprising five per cent each of the company.

Arthur Aguilar, general manager of NDC explained this is to broaden the
ownership base of the company and even make it more marketable.

"At an indicative price of P10 each, this will entail a large sum of
money. Instead of doing an all-or-nothing type of bidding, we decided
to split it up," Mr. Aguilar explained.

While it is possible a single bidder will get all four chunks, it can
also happen that an entity may bid for the four and not get any, the
NDC official noted.

A bidder is required to put 10% upfront of his bid price upon
submission of the bid, 50% not later than October 25 and 40% within
ninety days from the awarding.

NDC noted the number of shares to be offered may increase depending on
the decision of Wing Tiek's partner, Marubeni Corp. on its pending $50
million obligation as part of the Malaysian's second tranche.

Wing Tiek is in the process of acquiring 75% of NSC. It has paid for
more than 60% but liquidity crunch has delayed its payment of the $90
million supposedly due in August.

It worked out a strategic venture with Marubeni wherein the latter will
buy 6% of NSC shares the Malaysians earlier committed to take.

But Marubeni is said to be having second thoughts on plunking in $50
million (P1.3 billion) without the resolution of the land issue.

NSC has about P700 million worth of properties it had to spin-off since
it is now majority-owned by a foreigner. The Constitution expressly
stated no foreign entity can own land in the Philippines.

As of press time, nothing has been heard of Marubeni's decision. Mr.
Aguilar said if Marubeni keeps an uncertain stance, then the NDC board
will meet this week to decide whether to include the 6% commitment in
the put-option clause.

With no takers, this chunk will revert to Wing Tiek again. And NDC will
be left to contend with another round of IOUs.

PTT of Thailand, Coastal Petroleum joint venture to build local gas
stations

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Manolo A. Serapio, Jr.

State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) has firmed up plans
to tie up with United States-based Coastal Petroleum to put up 200
service stations here, sources told BusinessWorld yesterday.

Sources said PTT has secured the approval of the Thai government for
the said project. Officials of the firm are due to arrive this week to
finalize the joint-venture agreement with Coastal.

Coastal which runs a large oil depot in Subic Bay Freeport in Olongapo
will be supplying the petroleum products to the Thai firm.

PTT will concentrate on marketing fuel products in Metro Manila.
Initial investments for the project is estimated at $120 million.

Coastal operates the Coastal Subic Bay Terminal, Inc. which stores 2.4
million barrels of oil. It also runs a similar depot in Clark Field in
Pampanga that has a storage capacity of half a million barrels.

The project will be the first for PTT. Coastal has been operating the
Subic depot since 1993 shortly after the US vacated its military base
in Olongapo.

Coastal has consistently been supplying any shortfall in the domestic
petroleum demand. The firm provides at least 20,000 barrels a day to
augment local requirements which averages 350,000 daily.

A Coastal official said plans are under way to for a $20-million
upgrading bid of the firm's existing pipeline in Clark to facilitate
transport of fuel products.

Aside from the PTT-Coastal project, no other newcomers in the partially
deregulated oil industry have finalized plans to invest in marketing
petroleum products. But Department of Energy (DoE) director Zenaida
Monzada said other firms can actually pursue investment interests
without informing the DoE.

"This is one of the results of a deregulated industry. They (investors)
can opt to come to us when they have their respective projects already
in place," she said.

The government has eased rules on the entry of new players in the
petroleum industry as part of its economic liberalization program. The
partial deregulation phase where pricing remains semi-regulated by the
Energy Regulatory Board will last until February next year. With full
deregulation a month later, petroleum pricing will be market-dictated.

Luis Dizon group files cases vs SEC at the appellate court, Ombudsman

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina  G. Perez and Norman C. Aquino

After being prevented from taking control of Dizon Copper Silver Mines,
Inc. (DCSMI) because of a recent temporary restraining order (TRO)
issued by a hearing officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the former management of the company went to the Court of
Appeals (CA) asking that the actions taken during the stockholders
meeting held last September 4 be nullified.

The hearing at the SEC was held to decide whether or not the TRO issued
last September 16, 1996 by hearing officer James Abugan which is
effective for 72 hours should be extended.

At the same time, the former management led by Dr. Luis Dizon also
filed before the SEC a motion to dismiss the case and an opposition to
the extension of the TRO.

The CA earlier issued a TRO preventing the Commission from enforcing
its order directing the officers of DCSMI to hold a stockholders
meeting. The TRO was issued in light of a petition filed by the bloc
led by Dr. Luis Dizon before the CA last September 3 seeking to stop
the stockholders meeting.

However, the stockholders present during the assembly went on with the
meeting claiming they constitute the majority. Moreover, they said they
were not parties to the TRO because it was only the SEC which was
enjoined by the CA from enforcing its order. During the meeting, the
group also elected a new set of directors.

Atty. Armando M. Marcelo, counsel for Dr. Dizon's group, said yesterday
aside from asking the CA to declare as null and void the actions taken
during the stockholders meeting, the group also asked the appellate
court to hold in contempt DCSMI's elected officers led by chairperson
Teresita Dizon.

He said they also asked the SEC to dismiss the case because the matter
has been elevated to the CA. "The SEC can't entertain the case anymore
because only the CA can do that at this point," Mr. Marcelo said.

In yesterday's hearing at the SEC, Mr. Marcelo said the TRO issued last
September 16 is "void" and "nonexistent" because it was issued by a
hearing officer who is not authorized to do so.

Citing SEC's special rules for the issuance of TROs and writ of
preliminary injunction, Mr. Marcelo said only the director of the
Securities Investigation and Clearing Division (SICD) can issue TROs.

The rules read in part: "If the matter is of extreme urgency, such that
unless a TRO is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will
arise, the SICD director shall issue the TRO effective only for 72
hours..."

"I would like to stress, there is not even anything (TRO) to extend.
The rules on the issuance of TROs are very clear," Mr. Marcelo said.

Atty. Manuel Singson, counsel for the newly elected board of directors,
said even if the TRO issued by Mr. Abugan is indeed invalid, the SEC
can still issue another TRO.

Atty. Efren Moncupa, counsel for the same group, said they will pursue
their move for the issuance of a TRO because the operations of DCSMI
are adversely affected by the ongoing controversy. He said at present,
the operations of the company are suspended because its office has been
padlocked by the former management.

He said the group will file a motion with the CA to dismiss the other
group's petition so that the new directors and officers can assume
their posts at DCSMI.

Meanwhile, a stockholder of DCSMI yesterday filed graft charges before
the Office of the Ombudsman against SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay, Jr.
and five others.

Also charged were commissioners Fe Eloisa Gloria, SEC lawyers Ruben
Ladia, Juanito Almosa, Benito Cataran and Rosalina Tesorio.

Mr. Sinugbuhan accused the SEC officials of giving undue injury to
DCSMI by giving unwarranted benefits to Teresita Dizon, Lourdes Dizon,
Fortunata Matsuda, Juvencio Dizon, Ramona Feliciano and Deogracias
Datu, also stockholders of the mining company.

He claimed the SEC officials conspired to illegally hold back two TROs
issued by SEC hearing officer Evilio Pomento on September 4.

The first order restrained the holding of a stockholders meeting the
following day until alleged tampering of proxy votes and dissipation of
corporate funds would have been resolved.

The second order barred the group of majority stockholder Teresita
Dizon from being nominated and elected to the mining firm's board of
directors.

Mr. Sinugbuhan said by suppressing the TROs, the SEC officials paved
the way for a romp election by Ms. Dizon's group, causing confusion
among DCSMI stockholders.

He also scored the officials for allegedly meddling in the disposition
of the mining firm's cases.

"It is about time that the corrupt and high-handed acts of these
government officials be exposed and put to an end," Mr. Sinugbuhan said.

Mr. Pomento had issued the TROs based on the claims of DCSMI's
incumbent management that there was massive cheating in the validation
of proxies, the bone of contention between the two groups of
stockholders.

Mr. Ladia, officer-in-charge of SEC's SICD), did not release Mr.
Pomento's orders, claiming he saw the copies of the orders on September
5 or a day late and that such orders need to be reviewed prior to their
release.

Congress to probe Manuela Land and Houses Corp"s ouster in John Hay
bidding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ronaldo F. Jabal

Congress has stepped into the controversial bidding of the Club John
Hay conducted by the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA).

Yesterday, sixteen congressmen called for an investigation of the
bidding. Led by House of Representatives ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion chairman and Pampanga Rep. Carmelo Lazatin, a group of
solons want to find out if the recent disqualification of Manuela Land
and Houses Corp. (ML&H) by the BCDA in the bidding for Club John Hay in
Baguio City will result in huge losses to the government.

"The committee has been reliably informed that the result of the recent
bidding process will result in huge losses to the government...
Therefore, (we) resolved to direct the ad hoc oversight committee on
bases conversion to thoroughly conduct an inquiry interest of the
government," the group said.

Besides Mr. Lazatin, the other congressmen who called for the probe are
Reps. Bernardo Vergara, Jose Yap, Felicito Payumo, Herminio Aquino,
Jovito Claudio, Zenaida Ducut, James Gordon, Renato Diaz, Roilo Golez,
Victor Ortega, Dante Tinga, Eduardo Ermita, Jose Cojuangco, Amadeo
Perez and Oscar Rodriquez. All of them are members of the committee.

In a resolution, the congressmen noted that in a recent bidding, the
BCDA awarded the right to develop the Club John Jay through a 25-year
lease contract to ML&H consortium composed of Manuela Corporation,
Thailand's Land & Houses Public Co. Ltd.. Asia Pacific Planning and
Evaluation Co., First Asia Eagles Capital Corp. and AB Capital and
Investment Corp.

ML&H bidded P1.588 billion, which is more than three times bigger than
the next bidder, the Fil Estate-Penta Capital Group. The latter offered
only P425 million.

However, the BCDA declared ML&H in default for failing to meet the
deadline to sign a lease agreement for the development of the project
and forfeited the P100-million cash deposit the group posted during the
auction last July. As such, the contract was awarded to the second
highest bidder, Penta Capital-Fil Estate.

BCDA chairman Victorino Basco was earlier quoted as having said the
decision to award the contract to the second highest bidder came
following the opinion of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel
(OGCC) that ML&H violated the terms of reference of the John Hay
auction.

ML&H reportedly refused to sign an agreement with BCDA due to concerns
over the total land area covered by the contract. It claimed the area
that would be available for development was only 121.77 hectares
because more than half of the 246.99 has that BCDA bidded out were
protected forest lands and untitled lands.

Philippines Retirement & Separation Benefits System offers Riviera Club
shares to raise funds for projects

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Larina G. Perez

Riviera Golf Club, Inc. is offering 2,250 golf club shares to the
public to raise P1.2 billion for its resort and residential project in
Silang, Cavite.

In an application filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), Riviera Golf said the offered shares are broken down as follows:
1,328 class "A" common shares; 210 class "B" common shares; and 712
class "C" common shares. Priced at P550,000 each, the shares are being
offered to the public.

The golf course, which is owned and being developed by the Armed Forces
of the Philippines Retirement and Separation Benefits System
(AFP-RSBS), will provide the main attraction for the entire sports and
leisure complex project. The sports complex, covering 44% of the total
312-hectare land area, will consist of two 18-hole championship golf
courses and a country club.

Riviera Golf Club has commissioned CCA International Ltd. to operate
the golf club. Aside from operating the club, CCA will also provide
pre-opening assistance during the development phase.

CCA will also recommend and review overall club concepts and detailed
facility plans, establish purchasing and control systems for clubhouse
and golf-course related equipment, as well as monitor work progress and
quality standards during the development period. It will also hire and
train the club's staff.

Among the support facilities and amenities to be included in the golf
clubhouse are: a fine dining restaurant, pro shops, tee bar, putting
green; a golf academy, and a driving range among others.

The construction of the golf club started last January and development
has reached 30% accomplishment. It will be completed by December of
next year.

As a fully integrated sports complex, the property will also feature
residential units. The whole complex will be completed within two years.

VIEW FROM THE TOP: Real competitive advantage

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 6

By Ma. Clarissa S. Batino

In today's cutthroat competition, business guru and strategist Michael
Porter comes with his main edict likened to the classic saying that
"the battle is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift."

An author of three books in competitive advantage, Mr. Porter was in
Manila recently to share his insights with Filipino managers.

He said a gung ho zest for operational excellence may fatten up profits
for some years. But without the proper allowance for sustainable
development, the driving force will weaken and like karma, the
shortcomings will eventually catch up with the entrepreneur.

Mr. Porter encouraged firms to innovate and recreate, to step out of
the purely profit-driven mold of today's business into a dynamic,
well-balanced and prosperous industry ready to face the global battle
that has started.

He joined Harvard Business School in 1973 and has advised international
firms including AT&T, First Boston, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard,
NEC Corp., among others.

In an exclusive interview with BusinessWorld, Mr. Porter shares some of
his insights into gaining a real competitive advantage.

BusinessWorld (BW): What is the formula for competitive advantage you
speak of?

Michael Porter (MP): It's hard to give it in a sentence. The simplest
way of saying it is that competitive advantage grows out of choosing to
be unique in some way in your business. And choosing to be unique means
that you must limit yourself by not doing everything in the industry.
But by choosing to do a few things that you want to be special at.
That's the essence of competitive advantage. Not spreading yourself too
thin. Like what most companies do. Basically, in the Philippines where
there are so many opportunities and so much growth, there is a very
strong pressure to just pursue all these great ideas.

BW: You say one has to find a niche for the company?

MP: Well its not necessarily a niche. It can serve quite a wide market.
But you got to find a particular kind of value that you are offering to
your customers. It might be many customers. It might be just a few
customers. And I talked today about the different ways of creating a
unique position. But all of them require a choice. All of them require
you to make trade-offs. You gonna do this but not that. You have to
deliberately choose not to serve certain customers, not to offer
certain features.

BW: In one of your articles you expounded on environmental aspect of
doing business. You mentioned resource productivity which many
companies apparently do not want to waste money on. But how do you view
the situation when one firm tackles sustainable development and the
other does not? Isn't this environmental thing supposed to be a
concerted effort? Won't an effort of one cancel out the other?

MP: I think what we believe from looking at many products and services
is that actually environmental improvements lead to greater efficiency
on the part of the company. Sometimes in the short term there is a
transition while the company is learning to do something a different
way. So, its cost may be higher in the short term. But in the long
term, less pollution usually needs lower cost. Because pollution is
waste. So, I believe that its just good business for companies to be
thinking about how to eliminate or reduce their emissions, and their
discharges and their dumping. Because if they do that, they will be
taking steps that will also improve the utilization of raw materials.
And make them more efficient. Now, there is an issue of one company
competing in an environmentally unsound way and not face any sanctions.
And another company is forced to meet certain standards. And there
being not a level playing field. I do think cases like that exist. But
what we found more and more is that the company that is being
environmentally unsound actually won't be successful in the long-run.
And even in developing countries, countries shouldn't delay the
introduction of environmental standards because they simply reinforce
the process of economic development. Just like karma, you get it in the
end.

BW: Aside from environment, what other issues should companies today
seriously consider in doing business, those they have been ignoring for
a long time?

MP: I think that companies in the Philippines need really developed
strategies. They've been opportunistic. They've been doing a lot of
deals. They've been moving in a lot of fields. They need clear
strategies we're talking of. Number two, I think it's gonna be
increasingly necessary for companies here to at least compete in the
region not just in the country. Thirdly, as I said in the seminar, it's
gonna be necessary to change the nature of the strategic alliances that
companies do. I think historically companies in countries like the
Philippines have relied too heavily on their foreign partners. They're
gonna have to move to develop more internal capability and better
technology. I also believe that almost every company that's diversified
probably is gonna need to get more focused. That, for me, are the big
four issues.

BW: Do you discourage alliance with foreign partners?

MP: I'm arguing that those alliances need to be shifting in their
character. They need to be more selective. They need to give the
Philippine company the opportunity to sell its own brand. In some
international markets, they need to create more room for Philippine
companies to start to move to more sophisticated strategies. Alliances
are still gonna be indispensable tools for bringing in technology,
bringing in skills, getting access to an international marketing. What
I'm really saying is that the alliances of five years ago are gonna
have to be changed.

BW: How do you view this situation wherein developing countries are
racing with much-developed economies and they are faced with prospect
of depleting much-abused resources. How do you strike a balance?

MP: Again, I believe that the process of successful economic
development requires the country to learn not to deplete its resources.
So, for example, one of the problems the Philippines has is in a
variety of industries, because of poor regulatory climate and so forth.
You're depleting assets like fishing grounds. That kind of strategy
don't support increasing economic development. What you need to do is
you need to have a regulatory environment that says no, you can't fish
anymore than the fishing stock will permit. And that's a sign the
country is getting more developed. It has policies and regulations that
encourage conservation and renewal of resources. And ensure the
resources are not wasted. The prices set for resources are
market-driven prices so companies don't waste them. In a lot of
countries, the countries give away mineral deposits or timber rights.
But that's a bad policy. If government owns the land they should be
setting prices for timber that are (raw) prices. And that forces the
company to learn how to be more efficient. I don't think its inevitable
that resource-depletion will occur with economic development. In fact,
I think that successful economic development demands that the country
learns how to avoid depleting resources.

BW: I just want to play devil's advocate. Don't you agree with Jurassic
Park where one of the characters - the scientist - said the earth can
take care of itself?

MP: I think the earth can take of itself only if... I think one can
create an environment and... where we humans do unnecessary damage. And
see, I think its good business to not deplete the earth's resources. I
think if we can just get intellectually, the right framework. And if we
can get governments to understand that there's actually quite a bright
future for the earth.

Housing funds released to banks

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) chief executive officer and
president Zorayda Amelia C. Alonzo announced recently the release of
funds to housing loan conduit banks and subdivision developers as part
of HDMF's initiative towards alleviating the country's housing backlog.

Speaking at the regular business meeting of the Subdivision and Housing
Developers Association (SHDA) at the Shangri-La Makati, Ms. Alonzo said
Pag-IBIG Fund has released P60 million since August 23 for housing loan
take-outs in the National Capital Region under the Unified Home Lending
Program (UHLP) window processing system.

She also said Pag-IBIG Fund, with resources of P40 billion as of end of
first semester 1996, is the primary financier of the national shelter
program.

In addition to the P5.4 billion released by Pag-IBIG Fund when it took
over mortgages not taken out by the National Home Mortgage Finance
Corporation (NHMFC) in 1995, Pag-IBIG Fund is committing P5 billion to
UHLP in 1996.

Pag-IBIG Fund's own lending window, the Expanded Home Lending Program
(EHLP), released P1.1 billion between January to July through housing
developers and banks.

Ms. Alonzo also said the SSS committed P5 billion for housing loans for
1996 under Pag-IBIG's lending windows. The Government Service Insurance
System committed another P5 billion.

Meanwhile, target low-income borrowers of socialized housing projects
may now apply for amortization support on their home loans under the
Abot-Kaya Pabahay Fund (AKPF) administered by the National Home
Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC).

During a recent Board of Director's meeting, NHMFC president Manual
Eduardo B. Lunas reported that, "cognizant of the realities of rising
land costs and escalating prices of housing construction, the
corporation has successfully secured the approval of the Housing and
Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) to amend the
qualification standards for availment of amortization subsidy under the
fund."

"To enable more low-income borrowers of social housing projects to
qualify for subsidy, the new AKPF guidelines provide for an increase in
the monthly gross family income cap by as much as 50%," Mr. Lunas added.

The AKPF amortization support component under Republic Act 6846 is a
two-tiered scheme which provides qualified borrowers a graduated
five-year support plan ranging from a high of 35% to a low of seven per
cent.

One of the requirements for availment is the monthly family gross
income of beneficiaries, now increased to P6,000 from P4,000 for Level
A and P7,000 from P5,000 for Level B.

New elevator technology reduces crowding

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. has announced the local availability
of the Schindler Miconic 10TM system, a revolutionary feature in its
Schindler 700 elevator series.

The Miconic 10TM allocates elevator cars to passengers according to
their destination before they even ride the car, thus reducing crowding
and confusion as elevator doors open.

"The Schindler 700 series of elevators is our premium line of elevators
for high-rise buildings. It was developed to ensure maximum efficiency,
comfort and aesthetic beauty to what will become architectural
landmarks," said Gus Haxton, Jardine Schindler Elevator Corp. general
manager.

"Now the Miconic 10TM enhances the Schindler 700's performance by
telling passengers what elevator they should ride before they approach
the car."

The Miconic 10TM has a hall call control system. Passengers enter the
number of their destination floor on a keypad installed in the elevator
lobby. The system will then assign an elevator and display it on a
small screen.

The assignment is based on the passenger's known destination. Crowding
in the car and lobby is then avoided, as well as rushing to the nearest
elevator door that opens.

Mr. Haxton said, "This system also ensures lesser landing stops during
the journey because the elevator knows how many will be in the car and
where its occupants are headed. Passengers will then get to their
floors faster and more comfortably. Elevator availability increases and
journey times decrease even under heavy traffic conditions."

Real estate body to host regional symposium here

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Chamber of Real Estate and Builders' Association (CREBA) will host the
first ever regional symposium on "The Search for a Sustainable City for
the 21st Century" in Manila on October 16-19, 1996.

Techie Bautista, conference deputy director said, "In the main, the
quality of life in the cities of the 21st century is what the
conference is all about."

She added the conference is a private sector initiative which aims to
organize an industry-led movement to develop structural references for
an ecologically sustainable city for the next millennium.

New York University professor and CREBA consultant Rudy Cuba defines
sustainable city as a city "developed in ways that are socially just,
ecologically sustainable, politically participatory, economically
productive and culturally vibrant."

He also said the vision of a sustainable city is one that is integrated
with its natural surroundings and the province or region where it is
located.

"We are shedding the traditional concept of isolation. Instead, our
urban ecosystem is viewed as integral part and in concert with the
wider ecosystem," he said.

Gov"t bridge program faces delay

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

With the rising number of politicians seeking to be accommodated, a
P1.3-billion government bridge program involving the construction of
207 pre-fabricated steel bridges nationwide, is facing delay.

A government source told BusinessWorld the final list of program
beneficiaries should have been finalized and approved by Malacanang
during the cabinet meeting Tuesday. However, the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH) supposedly failed to submit its list of
to-be-constructed national bridges.

This is after several national and local officials approached DPWH and
the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) clamoring for
the inclusion of several areas in the list of project beneficiaries.

DPWH and DILG were expecting Malacanang's approval of the list of
beneficiaries this month. It may be noted the P1.3-billion project is
to be financed by the United Kingdom which is expected to release the
project loan this September.

In August, UK ambassador to the Philippines Adrian Thorpe and Foreign
Affairs Secretary Siazon signed an agreement involving the first
tranche of the loan totalling P360 million.

Of the P1.3 billion total project cost, 80% or P1.03 billion will be
shouldered by the United Kingdom, 35% of which is deemed a grant to the
Philippine government.

The DILG is taking charge of 134 local bridges under the program while
the DPWH will oversee the construction and rehabilitation of some 73
national bridges. It may be noted the bridge program involves the
installation of some 8,000 meters of pre-fabricated steel bridges
nationwide. It will cover 12 regions and 34 provinces.

Materials for bridges will be procured from Mabey & Johnson Limited, a
steel bridge producer endorsed by the UK government.

Under the original project timetable, the construction of bridges
should be completed by September 1997. Each bridge will be put up
within two weeks.

Construction boom until 1998, says Philippine Constructors Association

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

Players in the local construction industry expect the construction boom
in the country to continue until 1998.

In a statement, the Philippine Constructors Association, Inc. (PCA)
said local public and private construction will accelerate by an
average rate of 12.4% and 15% respectively, for the years 1996-1998.

This is in view of the government's expectation of an eight per cent
annual average growth in Gross National Product (GNP) during the same
period given increases in investments, exports and consumer-led
spending.

"There is a great demand for construction within the Asia-Pacific
region," said Rogelio M. Murga, PCA president.

"The heavier requirements for infrastructure investments to support the
region's growth is tremendous," he added.

He said government construction projects will account for 43% of total
construction demand in the 1996-1998 period.

The PCA president noted under the 1993-1998 Medium Term Philippine
Development Plan, the government's infrastructure program requirement
was placed at P594.7 billion.

Of the amount, 45% will go to energy, power and electrification; 31% to
transportation and 15% to water resources.

He also noted residential construction will dominate the private sector
in the coming years given the expected strong demand for affordable
housing.

In the urban centers, major projects such as Fort Bonifacio, Ortigas
Complex, and several projects in Makati are taking shape.

Business activity in urbanizing places such as Cebu, Davao, Baguio,
Subic, General Santos will also contribute to the sustained demand for
private buildings, he said.

The PCA is recognized by the government as the active voice of the
construction industry, and is often consulted by government on policy
matters.

Quezon City property values up by 100%

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 17

By Cecille E. Yap

Joining the rush of local government units providing for increases in
property assessment in their respective areas, the Quezon City council
passed recently Ordinance 357 which provides for as much as a 100% hike
in the fair market value of real estate in the city.

The increase is expected to pave the way for an increase in the city's
real property tax collections.

It may be noted Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code allows
local governments to revise property assessments by preparing a new
"schedule of fair market values" for different classes of real estate
in their respective areas.

Provided, however, the new schedule is enacted through an ordinance
passed by the city or municipal council.

Under the ordinance, the new schedule pertains to the fair market value
only of raw land. The city government has yet to formulate a new
schedule for property assessment which covers raw land as well as
improvements thereon.

"The Quezon City government is in need of funds to cover the cost of
the increasing basic and essential requirements for a rapidly growing
population and a highly accelerated urbanization," noted City Ordinance
357.

Under the ordinance, property assessments are expected to rise by 15%
in areas classified as residences and by as much as 40% in areas
falling under commercial and industrial classification.

Also, fair market value of real estate in residential areas is placed
at between P1,500 and P3,500 per square meter. Commercial areas,
meanwhile, is appraised between P4,000 and P6,000 per square meter.

Fair market value of real estate used for hotels and residential and
commercial condominiums is placed between P6,000 and P11,000 per square
meter, depending on the type.

Meanwhile, real estate used for restaurants, schools, funeral parlors,
gasoline stations, motels, gymnasiums and other recreational centers is
valued between P2,000 and P9,000 per square meter.

The ordinance noted the last time the Quezon City government undertook
a general revision of the schedule of real property assessment was in
1981. Thus, such assessment is now considered unrealistic and obsolete.

Data obtained from Quezon City Hall also showed revenue from real
property taxes increased by as much as 300% from 1994 to 1996.

In 1994, real property taxes collected totalled P267.6 million. In
1995, this rose to P665 million.

This year, the city council expects the tax collection to slightly drop
to P626 million due to lesser penalty collections.

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Stork Group subsidiary Fokker Elmo has signed a contract with AVIC
(Aviation Industries of China) subsidiaries China Precision Engineering
Institute (CPEI) and China National Airborne Equipment Corporation
(CNAEC) to manufacture complex electrical wire harnesses for aircraft
for the benefit of both the Chinese and Western aviation industries.

The joint venture (60% Fokker Elmo shareholding), named Lang Fang
Fokker Corp., is also the basis for the development and manufacturing
of electrical systems for future Chinese aircraft programs, such as the
100-seat regioliner. Annual sales will grow to $50 million within five
years.

The contract was signed in the presence of many dignitaries in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People.

Fokker Elmo is part of the Fokker Aviation Group which was recently
acquired by the Stork Group of the Netherlands. In total, the Stork
Group employs over 20,000 people and has an annual turnover of $3
billion worldwide.

Fokker Elmo is located in Woensdrecht, the Netherlands, and specializes
in the design and manufacturing of electrical and electronic systems
for the aerospace and defense industries.

University of Asia and the Pacific set to expand course in advertising

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

By this time, everyone must have already heard about the University of
Asia and the Pacific (UA&P). From a think-tank conducting research in
economics and business, it set up a graduate school, and a liberal arts
college, all in just 25 years. More recently, people have been talking
about its unique program-graduating in just five years with a master's
degree.

The former Center for Research and Communication has kept true to its
old name. And just like its flagship, the Institute of Communication is
already setting its sails to establish the School of Communication
(SCM).

The Institute of Communication is just one of the many schools that the
University will set up. Right now, it offers undergraduate studies in
Communication focused on Advertising. Next year, it will already be
offering its five-year program in Advertising.

Surprisingly for a young program, barely six years old, the Institute
is already making a name for itself. Its faculty, for instance, is
composed mainly of notable practitioners from the industry. J.J.
Calero, CEO and chairman of J. Walter Thompson and Antonio Mercado,
chairman of Basic Advertising, have been teaching in the Institute for
almost two years now. Even today, more distinguished practitioners have
come to form part of the faculty. Some are CEOs and presidents of
multinational advertising agencies while others are entrepreneurs and
pioneers of their own agency. So students also learn to have that nose
for business and to value that skill of private enterprise.

The Institute believes in a theoretical and practical approach to
learning. That is why students are given a more first-hand and holistic
approach to education. In fact, the program's curriculum was patterned
after the International Advertising Association, the only global
partnership of advertisers, agencies, media and marketing
communications professionals. So the program is not only practical, but
also meets international standards.

Bankard launches double return promo

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 22

Bankard, Inc., the leading domestic credit card company and issuer of
Bankard One, the world's first installment smart card, offers its more
than 41,000 Bankard One cardholders the chance to win back twice the
amount of money they spent on their installment purchases using their
Bankard One through Bankard One's "Double Your Money Offer" raffle
promo.

With this promo, a Bankard One cardholder who purchases a television
set worth P10,000 will get the chance to win P20,000 in cash.
Cardholders who make their purchases during the "Double Your Money
Offer" promo period from July 1 to December 31 are automatically
included in the six monthly raffles plus the grand raffle draw. They
just have to use their cards and nothing else.

Three winners are picked in every monthly draw. On the last draw on
January 16, the grand winner will get P100,000 and the three winners
P20,000 each. Bankard One cardholders can win a total of seven times
which is equal to six monthly draws and the grand draw. However, they
cannot win more than once per month and of that amount, not more than
P100,000. All prizes are tax paid.

Individuals who do not yet own a Bankard One can apply for one, and if
approved, can start using their cards to qualify for the raffle draws.

The first and second monthly raffles took place last August 15 and
September 12. Succeeding draw dates are on October 10, November 14,
December 12 and January 16. To qualify for the raffle on October 10,
the cardholder will have to make his purchases not later than September
30. Cardholders who make purchases after September 30 qualify for the
November 14 draw, and so on for the remaining draws.

Cardholders who win in any of the raffle draws will still be eligible
to win in all the remaining draws. They do not have to make additional
purchases in order to qualify for the remaining draws if they already
won in the previous draws. All Bankard One cardholders are encouraged
to keep using their Bankard One cards, as the more they charge the more
money they get at double the amount if they win in any of the raffle
draws.

FEATURE: Authorities rely on P70 lens to fight assault on the dollar

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Elisha R. Garcia

Have you ever looked at a dollar bill and wondered if it was fake?

Roughly 55% of the $360 billion currently in circulation is held by
people outside the United States, according to regional magazine Asia,
Inc. It said nearly $135 million worth of bogus bills were confiscated
outside the US in 1994, up from just $30 million two years earlier.

At the rate demand is rising as a result of increased consumerism and
globalization, don't be surprised if one of these bogus bills lands in
your hand one of these days.

"The sheer ubiquity of the US currency which has had essentially the
same size, color and configuration since 1929, makes it a primary
target for counterfeiters," Asia, Inc. reported. And the $100 bill,
which accounts for around 60% of the US currency in circulation, has
been the most frequently faked.

Color copiers, laser printers and high-tech graphics software make
banknotes easier to copy. Computer programs can be designed to generate
random or sequential serial numbers in the bills.

Growing concern over rampant counterfeiting prompted the US Federal
Reserve Bank to come out with new tamper-resistant bills, starting with
the $100 bill early this year.

In a brief on the new dollar bill, the Fed said "the noticeable change
in appearance of the dollar bill represents ongoing commitment to
protect the US currency."

Among the 14 features incorporated in the new design were an enlarged
off-center portrait of Benjamin Franklin, a polyester security thread
running through the paper, a translucent watermark, and inks that
change colors when viewed from different angles.

Despite these efforts, many say the US dollar bill continues to be
under threat.

In the Philippines, Bangko Sentral has launched an information
campaign. It holds training seminars for bank tellers, cashiers, branch
managers and even auditors, and promotes the use of simple, easy-to-use
instruments to check the authenticity of the dollar bills freely
entering the financial system.

Training sessions on basic information like the identification of
counterfeit money can last for a day, while sessions on the commonly
used modus operandi of counterfeiting and measures to counteract them
can last for a week, said Bangko Sentral bank officer Maja Gratia L.
Malic.

"We do not just provide training sessions to anybody interested. They
must have proper endorsement," Ms. Malic said.

"We are careful in giving out information as this may be passed on to
counterfeiters themselves... We request participants not to talk about
the finer details of their training," she explained.

In the training sessions, trainees are also taught how to use basic
instruments in detecting the authenticity of banknotes.

These include hand-held lens for examining fine prints and machines
with ultraviolet light which brings out the fluorescent parts of the
dollar bills.

"These are very easy to acquire and benefits outnumber the costs on the
part of the banks. There are also more advanced instruments available
to them which they can acquire at a higher cost," said Henry N. Eisma,
Bangko Sentral deputy director for cash.

An eyepiece or a simple lens costs around P70 while a desktop
ultraviolet light can be had at P300 a piece. On the other hand, a more
sophisticated machine may cost several thousands of pesos, Mr. Eisma
said.

Officials said there has been a substantial drop in the volume of
counterfeit money the central bank has retrieved.

In 1991, there were 5,920 pieces of counterfeit dollar bills estimated
to cost $583,266 that were accumulated, Bangko Sentral documents show.

Last year, the volume dwindled to 837 pieces worth $73,630. As of
August 1996, Bangko Sentral's cash department, soliciting the help of
the US Secret Service, accumulated 497 fake bills worth $39,000.

Requests to establish the authenticity of the bills usually come from
individuals, police authorities and owners of large establishments. The
central bank then issues a certificate verifying the authenticity of
the bills.

Among the establishments which regularly approach Bangko Sentral are
hotels, the Shoemart and Rustan's department store chains, duty-free
shops, the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corp., and Laguna-based
theme park Enchanted Kingdom, Mr. Eisma said.

PDCP Bank bares expansion plans

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

By Dulce J. Castillo

Fresh from its acquisition of First Philippine International Bank
(First Bank), PDCP Development Bank is targetting a net income of P155
million this year.

"We are working hard towards that direction and presently we are still
on target," bank president Carlos Torres recently told BusinessWorld.

Under the bank's expansion program, Mr. Toress said PDCP plans to have
a network of 80 branches by year-end. Its network grew to 76 from only
19 before the merger.

He said the bank is in the final stages of integrating the two banks'
physical infrastructures.

Late last year, PDCP Bank bought 90% of the assets and liabilities of
cash-strapped FirstBank in exchange for 33% of FirstBank's shares of
stock.

This, however, does not include FirstBank's the P390-million obligation
to Bangko Sentral which the central bank extended when the bank was hit
by heavy withdrawals about two years ago.

"The liabilities we assumed were just selected. There were certain
obligations to Bangko Sentral which we did not buy. I think, that has
been settled," Mr. Torres said.

FirstBank's debt is payable over 29 years. It has tapped Dutch-based
ING Bank which has arranged for a 28.5-year peso-denominated bond to
cover the debt.

PDCP Bank's shareholders include the Metro Pacific Corp. and
DEG-Deutsche Investitions-und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH.

MegaLink, ExpressNet to ink merger agreement

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Two of the country's top consortia of automated teller machines (ATM),
Bank of the Philippine Islands' (BPI) ExpressNet and MegaLink, have
formally agreed to link up their networks by first quarter of next year.

The consortia will sign a memorandum of agreement on Sept. 24,
according to a BPI statement released yesterday.

The move will enable more than six million cardholders from both
networks to carry out banking transactions in over 1,500 ATM networks
in Metro Manila and the provinces, the statement said.

Aside from BPI, members of ExpressNet are Banco de Oro, BPI Family
Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines
and Solidbank Corp.

Comprising MegaLink are Active Bank, Asian Banking Corp., Asiatrust
Bank, Banco Davao, Bank of Commerce, Bank of South East Asia, Capitol
Development Bank, Development Bank of the Philippines, Equitable
Banking Corp., Far East Bank and Trust Co., Insular Savings Bank,
International Exchange Bank, LBC Bank, PhilAm Savings Bank, Philippine
National Bank, Philippine Veterans Bank, Pilipinas Bank, Premiere
Development Bank, Prudential Bank, Queen City Development Bank, Traders
Royal Bank, Union Bank of the Philippines, United Coconut Planters
Bank, and Urban Bank.

MegaLink had earlier linked up with the country's third ATM network,
BancNet. The disparity between the computer systems of BancNet, which
uses a six-digit personal identification number (PIN), and ExpressNet
and MegaLink which both use a four-digit PIN, has been cited as a major
stumbling block in the possible merger of all three ATM consortia.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Not the same Friday

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Last Friday's party of the Money Market Association of the Philippines
(MART) wasn't the kind of Friday Club that became infamously known for
being a sleazy venue for traders at the height of the Bancap scam.
Soon-to-be MART member International Exchange Bank hosted the evening's
affair which filled the second floor of Vincent's San Mig at Jupiter
St. in Makati City. The crowd was typically yuppie, with traders
exchanging pleasantries about the yield curve, the peso and their
banks' portfolio. Spotted hobnobbing with traders were Bangko Sentral
treasurer Boy Edeza and Bureau of Treasury deputy treasurer Eduardo
Mendiola.

Another story circulating about the same bank is about its branch

BANK ACCOUNTS: Inside job

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

A big universal bank recently found its hands full of mounting
complaints from its credit cardholders after a key officer in the
bank's card division left in a huff. Industry sources say it was
already too late in the game when the bank discovered the officer had
faked billing statements and had personally pocketed payments. Heads
consequently had to roll when management discovered the officer had
managed to pull off the caper single-handedly for five years. Charges
can't be filed against the officer who came out in clean and is now
living somewhere in the US probably getting a tan in a beach in
California.

BANK ACCOUNTS: Hatta as the new BTr chief?

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

Bangko Sentral's accounting and information technology managing
director Teresita Hatta is being seriously considered to take the post
of National Treasurer Caridad Valdehuesa who is due to step down from
her office this September 30. While Ms. Valdehuesa's resignation may be
welcome news to some, especially to her deputy for internal affairs who
is at the forefront of an ouster move against the Treasurer, a number
of bank treasury officers feel the no-nonsense Ms. Valdehuesa has done
a good job in the BTr. They say it's during her stint when the capital
market deepened with the issuance of longer-tenored bonds and the
computerization of government securities trading. Never mind if she's
in a tiff with monetary authorities once in a while.

BANK ACCOUNTS: "Publicly listed" bank kuno

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 9

People at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) must have discussed
some things in their stockholders' meeting that would pose a threat to
national security. Members of media and brokers went home in disgust
last Monday after they were barred from covering the RCBC meeting.
Stockholders' meetings are traditionally open to reporters and
analysts. "The instruction from management was that the stockholders'
meeting will be exclusively for stockholders because the venue is quite
small," Griselda Barrot, a lawyer with RCBC, was quoted in Bloomberg as
saying. Prior to the incident, the bank informed the Philippine Stock
Exchange (PSE) it plans to discuss a 10-fold hike in its authorized
capital to P8 billion. The meeting may have been held closed-door
because the bank is anticipating some shareholders to oppose a plan to
sell P2.5 billion of shares to the public to raise an additional P2
billion via a stock sale to current owners, an RCBC official told
BusinessWorld. In a disclosure yesterday to the PSE, the bank said the
plans have been approved by its board. The bank is controlled by the
family of Philippine Ambassador to Japan Alfonso Yuchengco.

Chefs on Parade opens today

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

Chefs on Parade (COP) '96 is just one of three food related events
which will be held at the Philippine International Convention Center
(PICC) starting today until Sept. 21.

Being held concurrently are Hotelexpo '96, which is the 6th
International Trade Exhibition on Hotel and Restaurant Equipment, and
Bakexpo '96, the 3rd International Trade Exhibit on Equipment and
Supplies for the Bakery and Confection Industry.

Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor will lead the opening rites of the COP at
10 a.m. at the PICC Plenary Hall, followed by the opening rites of the
other two expositions at the PICC Reception Hall. She will be assisted
by the chairman of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of the
Philippines (HRAP) Larry Cruz, HRAP President Leo Prieto, Jr., COP '96
chairman Bobby Carpio, and Alexander Limjoco, the chairman of World
Exhibitions and Conventions, Inc., which organized Hotelexpo '96 and
Bakexpo '96.

For his part, Mr. Prieto said, "Chefs on Parade '96 is expected to
secure the country's place in the international culinary scene while
strengthening trade relations, exchanging cuisine, culinary products
and food service technology among APEC's 18-member economies."

Representatives from 70 local hotels and restaurants are expected to
participate in this year's COP, which is a culinary competition
organized by the HRAP. Also participating are students from Hotel and
Restaurant Administration and Hotel and Restaurant Management schools
in the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Now on its 21st year, COP
will gather at least 3,000 professionals in 1,000 entry line-up for 35
major competitions for professional and student categories. The
competitions will showcase the best talents in the varied ways of food
and drink preparation, from cold food to cocktail preparation, hot
dish, Filipino cuisine, cake decoration, wedding cakes, pastries, fruit
and vegetable carving, ice carving and butter sculptures, table setting
and menu folder competitions.

As the COP this year adopts the theme "A Salute to APEC," eight of the
competitions will carry the APEC theme.

One of the sponsors, Asia Brewery Inc., this year will be adding the
following competitions to the usual line-up of events: the Q-Shandy
Table Display/Butter Carving Contest (open to professionals in the food
service industry); on-the-spot cocktail mixing contests - The Most
Creative Q-Shandy Mix for COP '96 and The Most Creative Beer Mix for
COP '96 (open to professionals and students).

Inc. will be conducting baking seminars, demonstrations and
consultations. Admission to the trade exhibit is also free.

The three events are expected to draw over 18,000 visitors this year.

Pickwick"s Capers: Something from China

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 24

As you all are reading this, I shall be enjoying myself wandering
around this year's Chefs on Parade, once again marvelling at the
intricate sculptures made from butter and chocolate. All of these are,
thankfully, in the traditional form of sculpture. One can actually know
what they are meant to be. We have yet to witness anyone attempting
modern art by welding together those frightful airline butter packs.

Of course, it is the active competitions that I enjoy. Watching any man
practicing an art that he has spent many years of his life in
perfecting is always a joy. Watching these chefs in action is actually
exciting. One wonder as to when one of our restaurants will emulate
that now proving popular in London aptly named "Chef's Table." As you
are all aware, London and some of its "top people" can display a
certain snobbishness, especially in restaurants. To be known by the
Patron and shown to the best table displays one's importance to the
rest of the world. The best table used to be the one in the corner or
by the window, where one could see and more importantly be seen by
everyone. That has all changed. To really be "in" one is now offered
the one and only table that is set up in the kitchen. Here, the chef
will recommend and personally prepare the food and have the correct
wines served. All the while, you and your guests can watch him in
action and receive his personal service. Nobody can see you, however,
but they all are aware that you are there. A lovely idea though, if one
can afford it as I understand the bill tends to match the meal. At
least at COP one can watch the chefs in action, even if only the judges
get to try the end result.

I read a rather amusing but true story this week about one amateur cook
who had a distressing experiencing. In 1987, a lady, a cottage dweller
in Dartmoor, Devon, popped some scones into the oven and completely
forgot about them.

An hour later, just as she was stepping into the bath, she suddenly
recalled them. Without even grabbing a towel, she dashed stark naked
into the kitchen and while gripping the oven handle, she heard a knock
on the back door. Being in the country, she knew that if it was the
baker and if she didn't answer, he would automatically let himself in
and put the bread on the table. In a panic, she nipped into the broom
cupboard.

Hiding in the darkness, she heard the latch click and footsteps
crossing the kitchen, whereupon the cupboard door was opened by the
gasman who had come to read the meter. "Oh," said the woman, "I was
expecting the baker." When she got out, the scones were burnt as well.

Some newspaper columnists have of late indulged in attacking
restaurants for their practice of charging the full 10% VAT on the
final account. Their argument is that the customer should only pay the
same as that remitted by the restaurant owner to the BIR, which is
approximately 6%. This is, of course, nonsense. The reason that the
patron is only remitting the 6% to the BIR is that he has already given
4% to his supplier. If he treated this 4% as a cost, we, the consumer,
would be considerably worse off. As a simple example to prove the
point, he pays the supplier P100 plus P10 VAT. He now adds his wages,
overheads and profit and sells this to us at P200 plus VAT. We have
paid him P20 in VAT. He deducts the P10 he has already given the
supplier and remits P10 to the BIR. Thus, the full P20 has been
remitted. His mark up is 100% on cost. Should he treat his total
supplier's invoice as cost, then his selling price to ourselves would
be P220 plus VAT. Instead of our total bill being P220 as under the
present system, it would now become P242. I suggest to all campaigners
that it is a subject best left alone.

Most columnists delight in starting rumors. Pickwick, however, delights
in ending them. For months, rumors have been flying that probably the
most famous and popular watering hole for both foreigners and Filipinos
alike was, after 15 years, about to close its doors. Indeed, part of
the rumors were true, that being that as so many other businesses in
Makati, the owners were being subjected to rapacious and unrealistic
demands for lease renewal. While the property market contains so much
heat, as is currently the case, we will witness many food and beverage
outlets closing their doors in the coming years, especially in the
Makati district. Property owners are failing to understand that
restaurant customers will only frequent an establishment if its prices
are considered reasonable. Thus, there is a ceiling to what can be
charged and still attract customers. There is a mathematical percentage
of gross turnover that is the maximum one can pay for the business to
remain viable. Demands in excess of this mean closure.

It is true that prolonged negotiations over the lease of this
establishment did put the business in danger of closure and thus no
further investment was made by the owners. This danger is not only now
over, but the establishment is now ensured of a further ten years
tenure. Regular customers may experience some inconvenience however as
some extensive refurbishment will be undertaken to bring it to the
standards demanded by today's market. A new general manager has been
appointed whose plans for both cuisine and entertainment are really
quite exciting. For those of us who have used the facilities for many
years, it has become part of our personal history and we can now be
assured of it remaining so. Thus endeth the rumor!

Well, the best made plans for mice and men so oft they go astray. Some
weeks ago, during the daytime, my driver had taken me through an area
near Cubao which seemingly contained a number of restaurants that
appeared could well be of interest. I have ventured to my good lady
wife that we should visit this area one evening to sample the offered
cuisine. Whether the gods are interfering with my plans, I know not. It
would seem, however, that every time we plan for this outing, the
heavens open and the earth is deluged with rain. Full knowing that the
ill-drained streets of this metropolis will provide the inevitable
floods that not only cause inconvenience but drain many hours from an
otherwise useful life, we thus become reluctant to undertake such a
journey. We are thus committed, until the dry season commences, to only
explore within striking distance of our home. As we have covered this
beat for well over a year, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
find an establishment at which we have not dined. It was a relief,
therefore, to find a relatively new restaurant right in the heart of
Greenbelt, albeit offering Chinese cuisine, that of South Villa.

South Villa is not only new, it is bright, very, very bright. The
lighting is almost intense and with large uncurtained windows on two
sides, is not an establishment to be considered for an intimate meal
with one's paramour, not as though Pickwick would indulge in such
activity, I hasten to add. The tables are well set, sparkling white
tablecloths, excellent linen and available condiments such as soy and
hot sauce available.

The menu is not extensive, but interesting. I am unable to tell you as
to the province of China from which the type of dishes emulate. It did
not appear to be Cantonese and definitely not that area that I can
never spell correctly but phonetically sounds like, "Says one." (That's
Szechuan. - Ed.) I did ask the Filipino waiter as to where the food was
from and he answered, "China." An observant young man, one would think.

The range of soups offered was indeed extensive. My good lady wife
selected her favorite Chicken and Corn soup. A good portion presented,
but what can one say about Chicken and Corn soup except I admonished
her for failing our readers in the face of such alternatives. As
Shakespeare might of said on a decidedly off day, "The soup was good."

I had decided on the Beef and Tomato soup and was very pleasantly
surprised. The liquid was thin, but tasty. Quarters of peeled, fresh
tomatoes were aplenty, amongst which were thin strips of very tender
beef. The whole was both tasty yet delicate, one of the better soups
that I have had for a long time. Very, very good.

As usual, for our main dishes, we, like all others, selected far too
much. The menu lists prices for three sizes. I had started to select
the "Medium" when the waiter politely suggested that for just the two
of us, the small would probably be sufficient. How correct he turned
out to be. The portion of the "Small" is indeed generous.

We ordered the Beef with Macadamia Nuts. A delightful combination that
also contained well prepared vegetables. I adore macadamias, as long as
someone else has opened them. During our sojourn in Australia, at one
place, we were staying, a tree was in the garden. We would collect the
nuts, but the shells are the toughest thing in nature. Normal
nutcrackers just snap, hammering them is dangerous as they shoot off,
unbroken at any angle. If you do succeed with the hammer, the nut tends
to also be smashed and mixed with bits of shell. The solution turned
out to be the vice in the garage.

I digress. The beef was tasty chunks and very tender. The nuts were
delicious and probably the hardest thing that I have ever attempted to
pick up with chopsticks.

We had ordered the rice Fookien style. I would suggest that if you are
accompanied by a lady from the general area of Pampanga, as I was, with
my good lady wife, then you order this by pointing it on the menu. A
look of absolute shock came over her face as she misinterpreted my
words. (Only Filipinos with a knowledge of filthy language will
understand this comment.) The rice, which is what we would refer to as
fried rice, was particularly good and tasty. Good texture and moist,
with various vegetables finely chopped. For me, the good thing about
this was that it was also served in individual bowls. This allowed me
the luxury of spooning the beef dish on top, thus not only enjoying the
dish but even adding more flavor to the rice.

We had ordered Seafood Rolls, and again, be warned, the "Small" portion
contains eight quite large pieces. The rolls have a crispy, deep-fried
cover. Inside, they contain chopped squid and shrimp, with some finely
chopped carrot and probably celery. Unfortunately, they have also
included mayonnaise, a sauce of which I am not particularly fond, whose
creaminess overwhelms the seafood flavor. A dish of mayonnaise is
provided as an extra dip. Our American cousins, who tend to have a
penchant for this type of dressing, would probably enjoy them, but they
are not for me, nor even my good lady wife.

We had also requested the roast pigeon. A pigeon chopped into quarters
was delivered with crisp noodles. A rich dark meat which I enjoy. I
feel a little revenge when eating pigeon, revenge against all of that
breed of bird that has throughout my life indicated that they would
like to purchase my motor vehicle. Well, they at least leave a deposit
on it and it is there in black and white. My good lady wife found the
meat very tough. I thoughtfully informed her that in England pigeons
were allowed to hang in the garden until it was maggot-ridden and this
made the meat very tender. She, with an unusually pale face asked how
one removed the maggots. Upon being informed that one didn't bother as
they had been consuming the meat and therefore tasted the same, she
decided upon a visit to the comfort room. Being married to me has
decidedly improved her general knowledge.

I had consumed two glasses of the Paul Masson Chablis wine during the
meal, which was not that bad at all. It definitely goes well with
Chinese cuisine.

While I indulged in Chinese tea, my good lady wife tasted the Mango
Puree which she declared delicious. To the delight of our driver, the
fairly good portion of the meal that we had failed to consume was
packed for takeaway and we paid our bill of just over P1,500. Very good
value.

Overall, we had a pleasant meal served by polite and friendly staff. To
be fair to other cuisines though, Chinese can really never be described
as fine dining, so an award of two top hats is a reasonable assessment.

Quezon City"s little secret

from BUSINESSWORLD (Manila), September 19, 1996, page 23

By Vladimir S. Bunoan

Although it boasts of a popular restaurant row in Tomas Morato Avenue,
home of several old-time favorites like Mario's and Alfredo's Steak
House, Quezon City doesn't enjoy the same reputation as Makati - and
now the Ortigas Center - when it comes to fine dining.

Its restaurants, although doing great business among the many residents
in this part of the town, are generally old-fashioned, which means
having menus filled with such classic Filipino fine dining staples as
steaks and Caesar Salad. Generally, restaurants in Makati are more
adventurous when it comes to their menus, and with the growing
sophistication of Filipino diners, many establishments in Quezon City
seem dated.

But there is one restaurant in Quezon City that is breaking all the
preconceived notions about eateries north of Makati. Established less
than a year ago, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs has proven that the Quezon
City crowd is just as discriminating as the expense-account foodies of
Makati.

While positive word-of-mouth has tempted diners from as far away as
Antipolo and Alabang to check out the restaurant, this
deli-cum-restaurant has built a loyal following among those who either
live or work in Quezon City, including celebrities like Pops Fernandez,
Ogie Alcasid, and Gelli de Belen, who proudly calls it her "secret
little place."

Increasingly, however, more and more are let in on this secret. Food
critics like Doreen Fernandez have been generous with praise and are
personally recommending it to their friends. In the latest edition of
the Fodor's Guide to Manila, Blue Bacon and Green Eggs made it to the
list of restaurants for tourists to try.

That the restaurant is not located on a major street (it sits off
Balete Drive, on Lantana Street corner Boston, almost right across the
Boston Gallery) makes its success even more noteworthy. In a business
where "location, location, location" is considered a mantra, Blue Bacon
and Green Eggs seems to be more attuned to the "If you build it, they
will come" school of thought.

For owner Mike Prado, that seems to be an apt motto. A businessman who
made his fortune in exporting furniture and home accessories, Mr. Prado
believes that his entry into the food business is providential.

A member of the Catholic Charismatic Movement, Mr. Prado noticed that
his exports were not doing as well as before, and in fact seemed to be
on the decline. At the point, he prayed and asked God if he should
start looking at other businesses.

Mr. Prado had dabbled in businesses other than exports. He once
produced a musical called By George!, a musical tribute to American
composer George Gershwin, which was directed by his good friend, Behn
Cervantes. It was staged at the Metropolitan Theater in 1991. Although
he said he didn't lose money on that venture, he feels the theater
scene then didn't have the momentum it seems to be enjoying these days.

Mr. Prado admits that his biggest dream was to one day open a
restaurant. His friends attest to his skills in entertaining guests at
his home. He had the interest although he candidly admits that he
didn't know a thing about opening and running a restaurant.

He was asking for a sign from God, although the idea of putting up a
restaurant had become increasingly tempting. He knew that the sign
would be in the form of flowers, and one day a nun gave him a bouquet
of white roses for the little chapel within his residential compound.
He knew this was the sign he was waiting for ("Let's face it, a man
doesn't get flowers," he said). Immediately, he called up his architect
and had the restaurant built.

Everything, he said, just fell into place, as if indeed it was being
guided by a greater power. He had no problems in staffing, the supplier
for the delicatessen even agreed to give a two-week seminar for the
employees, and he got chefs who were trained in Le Souffle. ("I didn't
pirate them," he stressed.)

Sans the usual publicity blitz that accompanies restaurant openings,
satisfied customers spread the word and quickly the restaurant with the
funny name and the unusual location became a surprise hit. From a small
30-seater restaurant inside the deli, it has since been expanded to
accommodate around 100 guests, scattered in three areas. The original
dining area beside the deli, an al fresco garden setting with views of
lush greenery and a small waterfall (also the smoking area), and
another air-conditioned area, which was rushed to accommodate the
volume of Valentine's Day reservations.

(About the name, he explained he didn't know of the Dr. Seuss book,
Green Eggs and Ham, until after he opened the restaurant, and denied
that he is affiliated with La Salle and Ateneo. "Bacon and Eggs" was
already decided on, but he literally added more color to the way it
sound.)

Mr. Prado believes there are two important elements in the restaurant's
success - creativity and consistency. As the restaurant is connected to
a deli, the chefs have more ingredients to play around with. For
instance, Mr. Prado is proud that his is the only one in Quezon City
that offers goose liver (done pan-fried with scallops and served with
goat cheese, Parma ham, lettuce and Madeira dressing). A new addition
to the menu is Penne al Gorgonzola, a pasta dish flavored with the
strong Gorgonzola cheese plus Parmesan, with strips of garlic Italian
sausage, sundried tomatoes and fresh cream.

The menu is quite extensive, offering the usual deli sandwiches and
cold cuts, a long list of pasta dishes, and chef's specialties, plus a
variety of desserts, imported beer, souffles and coffee.

Mr. Prado, whose office is just next door to the restaurant, is now
making sure of the consistency. He is aware that the usual pitfall of
restaurant owners is expanding too fast, and he is careful not to be
tempted by this success.

He states confidently that he will continue with his export business,
which has since rebounded, thus calming the fears of his export clients
that he has not turned into a full-time restaurateur. He is, in fact,
planning to put up an IKEA-style furniture shop to cater to new
homeowners.

He is also thinking of converting another section of his compound into
a ballroom for shows and family-style entertainment.

Who says you can't have the best of both worlds?

Cambodia: Inside the KR: Innocent people tortured into confessing to
'crimes' and executed by the Pol Pot regime

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chiep Mony

Many innocent people were tortured into confessing to various "crimes"
against the state during the four-year genocidal regime under the Khmer
Rouge.

After confessing, these people were summarily executed. Among those who
had fallen victim were officials of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era of the
then-Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Republican regime of Lon Nol, anyone
believed to be an intellectual, such as students and teachers, as well
as all the civil servants of the previous governments.

Others who were considered "unimportant" people to the Pol Potists were
not even interrogated after being arrested by the authorities. They were
just executed immediately, said former Khmer Rouge information officer
Nhem Ein.

Nhem Ein met with the Cambodia Times again last week and revealed the
stories of the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979.

He said that to monitor the many interrogations and executions
through-out the country, the Pol Pot government had set up the Toul Sleng
torture centre in 1977.

"The chief of the centre was Duch, his deputy was Hea while the person
in charge of translating documents from Vietnamese to Khmer was Chan,"
he said.

He said the three men led the executions carried out at the centre by
receiving orders direct from the central Khmer Rouge leadership.

Toul Sleng, measuring a square km, was the main Khmer Rouge interrogation
and torture centre and could be considered the ministry of interior
during the guerilla regime.

Nhem Ein said the men at the centre were assigned a special mission to
"destroy the internal enemies" of the Khmer Rouge.

He said these "enemies" were normally people who were suspected of being
CIA or KGB spies or Vietnamese agents deployed in Cambodia. There were
also other "secret agents" who were "attempting to act against the Pol
Pot regime".

He said the Khmer Rouge personnel at the Toul Sleng centre were also
assigned to look for officials who had worked for the Prince Sihanouk
regime or the Lon Nol government and to file charges against them.

Nhem Ein said that under the maoist and dictatorial leadership of Pol
Pot, the Khmer Rouge had also created a "formula" to determine who were
intellectuals and to execute them.

"As a result, students and teachers, as well as officials who had worked
for the Prince Sihanouk and Lon Nol governments were arrested and
executed.

He said the Khmer Rouge devised various methods to interrogate prisoners.
"Some victims had their nails removed, others were electrocuted, some
were forced to drink fish brine, or had water poured into their noses,
while yet others were starved," he said.

"In fact, the interrogations were so cruel most of the prisoners ended
up confessing to crimes they did not commit," Nhem Ein said. "They could
not stand the suffering any more."

He said those who were regarded as unimportant persons were also arrested
but they were not interrogated. "Photographs of the victims would be
taken and they would be sent for execution immediately," he said.

Nhem Ein said the victims could be killed in any one of the prisons in
Toul Sleng, Prey Sar, Prek Hou or Choeung Ek.

He said that when youths were arrested, they were sent for execution
without their photographs being taken. However, if they were government
officials or military officers, their pictures were taken and sent as
evidence to the Khmer Rouge leadership.

Nhem Ein said the Khmer Rouge officers worked day and night to torture
and question the victims.

He said that in mid-1978, 30 Thai fishermen and three Europeans were
executed at the Toul Sleng centre.

He said random executions were also carried out against popular singers.
One was a famous singer Chhorn, who was ordered to sing the Democratic
Kampuchea songs together with Mai, a woman artiste.

Nhem Ein believes that another well-known singer Sin Sisamuth, known for
his "golden voice" was executed in either Prey Sar or the Tonle Bati
prison in 1976.

He said the singer had been executed for singing songs from the Sangkum
Reastr Niyum era while working in the padi fields. These songs had been
banned by the Khmer Rouge.

Also purged and killed were the commanders of Divisions 18 to 24, namely
Huo Nim, Vorn Vet, Hock, Chek An, Nat and a general Som. These were the
people who led the resistance movement in the 1970s. A former information
officer close to Huo Nim was also killed.

"Also executed were several commanders accused of being CIA or KGB spies
or Vietnamese agents such as Sok, Ya, Chakry, Nhem Phoem and Sy," Nhem
Ein said.

He said another objective of Pol Pot was to screen all students and
intellectuals and information on them was documented.

"The data and pictures of these students could fill 20 bus-loads," he
said.

"The students were called the "newly-liberated" people or the "17 April"
people. They were regarded as important and were sent to prison in Phnom
Penh.

"Those who were found to be involved in education were executed
immediately because they were thought to be in the way of the regime to
achieve its dream of a nation of agrarians," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: Govt appeals for help as floods worsen

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government of Cambodia has sent out an urgent appeal for
assistance as the floods continue to worsen in several parts of the
kingdom.

This year's floods, the worst in several years, have since taken 16
lives, and up to 1.3 million people are believed to have been affected.

Seven people have been reported missing and at least 500,000 people, who
are in the worst hit areas, require emergency assistance.

The government estimates that it needs more than US$5 million to carry
out relief operations and it is appealing for donations in cash, kind and
services to help the victims.

The deluge has since affected six provinces that lie in the Mekong basin,
namely Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey
Veng, as well as the outskirts of Phnom Penh.

In addition, at least 232,000 hectares of rice fields have been flooded
and the government reported that about 120,000 hectares have been
destroyed in the floods.

A total of 25 cases of diarrhea and vomiting have also been reported in
one village.

Cambodia: Floods hit 1.3 million people

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Cheang Sopheng

A total of 1.3 million people from six provinces have been affected by
the floods this year, and at least 500,000 of them require emergency aid.

The victims are from the provinces of Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie,
Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey Veng, which are located along the Mekong
River.

Also affected are those living on the outskirts of the capital city,
Phnom Penh.

Most of the victims have been evacuated to higher ground or have made
their own way to areas which are still not flooded.

However, the worst may already be over. Reports received from the
affected areas showed that the water level is already receding, albeit
slowly, though the situation is still grave.

Vast areas cultivated with padi have also been badly affected by the
floods. Based on reports received from the affected provinces, the
government estimates that a total of 232,000 hectares of padi fields have
been affected.

Of the total area, an estimated 120,000ha of padi fields, located closest
to the Mekong River, have been destroyed.

Figures that have reached Phnom Penh from the affected provinces show
that in Kompong Cham province, 25,212ha of padi fields have been
destroyed. In Kandal province, farmers lost 9,200ha and in Prey Veng,
another 50,000ha have been destroyed.

Details on the damage caused in the other provinces are expected to be
made available by the government this week.

The governor of Kompong Cham, Hun Neng, said the floods had affected at
least one third of the population who live in 12 of the 16 districts in
the province.

He said 274 dwellings in the province were already under water, and
28,960ha of padi fields have been badly damaged by the floods.

He estimated that about 2,400 tonnes of rice seeds would be needed for
next year's planting season.

Hun Neng said a stretch of 150m on the National Route 6, between Phnom
Penh and Kompong Cham, as well as a bridge, have already been damaged by
the floods.

Stretches along National Route 7 which runs through Kompong Cham town,
have also been severely damaged.

The governor of Prey Veng, Tep Nonary, said five districts in his
province have been seriously affected by the floods and more than
50,000ha of padi fields have been destroyed. Between 80 and 90 per cent
of the remaining four districts are also flooded.

As of last week, he said, 11,399 people have been evacuated and 3,149
dwellings were already under water.

Five areas along National Route 11 have been cut off by the floods. The
first deputy governor of Kratie province, Ven Sokhy, said 24,000ha of
padi fields have already been flooded.

He said 13,000ha of the padi crop have already been destroyed.

The Minister of Public Works and Transport, Ing Kieth, said more than 4km
of road from Phnom Penh to Sway Rieng have been damaged while the roads
from the capital city to Kompong Cham and Kompong Thom had been
destroyed.

Ing Kieth, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said his ministry officials
would inspect the roads and bridges after the floods and in areas where
there is an immediate need, the government would pay for the repairs of
the roads and bridges.

Cambodia: US$5 mil needed for flood relief operations

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government needs US$5.1 million in cash, kind or services from
international and local donors to meet the immediate needs of 500,000
people who have been hit by the floods.

The emergency assistance is needed to evacuate the flood victims and to
provide them with alternative accommodation, food and clothes.

The Co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen had
launched the appeal for aid last month by urging foreign and local
companies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), the United Nations and friendly countries to chip in with
donations.

Several countries and organisations have, in fact, already sent aid in
cash and in kind.

Deputy Prime Minister Ing Kieth said a meeting would be held this week
with representatives of the foreign embassies and aid agencies to discuss
the supply of aid to the flood victims.

The co-premiers have also been appealing for assistance as they toured
the various provinces affected by the floods.

"I would like to call on the various NGOs, the United Nations,
international organisations as well as local and foreign companies to
help meet the urgent needs of the victims of this disaster," Prince
Ranariddh said during a trip to Kompong Cham.

Hun Sen, who was also in Kompong Cham last week, described the situation
as a "great disaster" and said emergency aid was urgently needed.

The cabinet of Prince Ranariddh also issued a statement requesting
immediate assistance for the victims.

In response, the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the International Federation of the Red
Cross and Unicef met the National Committee for Disaster Management to
assess the situation and the assistance required.

The representatives said after the meeting that they would submit their
proposals which would be reviewed by the international donors and aid
agencies to come up with an aid plan.

Meanwhile, the government estimated that a total of 8,000 tonnes of rice
seeds would be needed over the next month in the areas most seriously
affected by the floods when planting begins after the floods.

Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tao Seng Hour said 4,000
tonnes of rice seeds had been prepared and would be supplied to victims
in the six badly affected provinces.

He said the ministry was also preparing to provide more than one million
litres of fuel for water pumps that are used in the padi fields.

He said the ministry would supply 300 tonnes of the rice seeds to Prey
Veng, the most badly affected province, once the floods have receded.

Nhim Vanda, who heads the disaster management panel, said aid agencies
have provided emergency funds and 2,300 tonnes of rice to the victims.

Speaking to flood victims in Prey Veng province last week, Prince
Ranariddh said the government had instructed the Ministry of Commerce to
prepare 1,600 tonnes of rice and other kinds of food for them.

He said local and foreign humanitarian organisations had donated tonnes
of rice through him, Hun Sen and president of the National Assembly
Samdech Chea Sim.

As the flood waters were rising, hundreds of victims also gathered
outside the Royal Palace to seek aid from King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen
Monineath.

In a broadcast on TV, the king expressed his sorrows over the sufferings
of the people and the damage to property and loss of animals caused by
the floods.

Cambodia: When it rains, it pours

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Disasters such as floods tend to affect the poor and needy more than
anyone else.

For 18-year-old Neun Run, forced by his parents to look for a job in
Phnom Penh, it was a period of starvation, fainting spells and the loss
of his hard-earned money.

After four days without food, and several fainting spells, Neun Run had
collapsed along Mao Tsetoung Boulevard last Thursday.

A motodop driver and staff of the Cambodia Times, who found him lying on
the roadside, brought him to the newspaper office where he was given
food, a drink and some medicine.

Neun Run, who is from Memot district, Kompong Cham province, said his
village was badly hit by the floods two weeks ago.

He said that when the water overflowed his village, hundreds of families
moved to the highlands while some found refuge along the highways. His
family lost everything except two sacks of rice which they managed to
carry with them.

A week later, when the food supply was running out, his parents told him
that he had to leave for Phnom Penh to try to get a job.

He said he then decided to leave for the capital city with a neighbour,
22-year-old Chon Ra, who told him that he could get a job washing cars
in Phnom Penh.

"Chon Ra told me we could earn 12,000 riels per month," he said. "He said
he could get a job in Phnom Penh but he needed an advance from my family.
Finally we agreed to give him 12,000 riels."

However, Neun Run said, when they reached Phnom Penh, Chon Ra ran away
with all the money and he was left for four days without food. "I slept
on the roadside and drank water from the potholes. I was living like an
animal," he added.

Neun Run said this was his first trip to the capital city and he does not
have any relatives there.

"I have no alternative now but to go back to my family to help them plant
rice after the floods have receded, but I do not have any money for
travelling," he added.

Meanwhile, in Prey Veng province, victims told the Cambodia Times that
several families were experiencing a shortage of food and medicine.

They said 25 people from the village of Angkor Ang had been hit by
diarrhea and were vomiting after eating stale food and drinking dirty
water. However, they have been treated at a local clinic.

"We will die if there is no emergency supply from the government. We need
food and medicine now," said 48-year-old Chhun Hear. "This is a bad
situation for us."

Cambodia: Willy brings the rain that causes the floods

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The severe floods in Cambodia this year have been caused by heavy rains
over the upper reaches of the Mekong River, brought on by the hurricane
Willy.

In the past two weeks, heavy rains have been recorded in the highlands
in southern China, Laos and north-east Cambodia, areas through which the
Mekong River flows.

Hurricane Willy also caused storms and downpours in Laos and parts of
Cambodia, causing the water in the Mekong River to rise up to an
extraordinarily high level.

The director of the Hydrology Department, Lim Kean Hour, said that in
Laos alone, up to 200ml of rainfall had been recorded during this period,
making the situation worse for Cambodia.

However, he said, the flood is not expected to affect Phnom Penh,
although several areas on the outskirts of the capital city have also
been flooded.

He said the water level of the Mekong River would be lower downstream.
Furthermore, he said, the water level in Tonle Sap lake has still not
reached its maximum and thus could take in more water.

The Tonle Sap lake, located in the north-western part of the kingdom,
acts as a safety valve for nature's drainage system.

The Tonle Sap river flows from the lake and joins the Mekong near Phnom
Penh. However, when there is excess water in the Mekong, the water flows
back into the lake, thus preventing areas downstream from being flooded.

Lim Kean Hour said Phnom Penh would only be flooded if the water level
in the Tonle Bassac river rises above the 11.2m mark.

As of last Friday, the level had reached 10.9m, so excess water could
flow back into the Tonle Sap lake, thus averting floods in the city and
areas downstream of the Mekong River, including southern Vietnam, he
added.

Cambodia: Reprieve illegal workers

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

Cambodians will be allowed to work in Thailand under an agreement to be
signed between the governments of the two countries soon.

This move will mean a reprieve for the more than 30,000 Cambodians who
are currently working illegally in the neigbouring kingdom.

The relaxation on the import of foreign labour by the Thai government
will also cover those from Myanmar and Laos - the other two countries
which share common borders with Thailand.

The new regulation will also cover those workers from Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar who are at present illegally employed in Thailand.

Prasitt Caitong Pan, the director-general of the Thai Department of
Employment in the Ministry of Social Welfare explained that the
government had decided to allow the illegal workers from these countries
to work legally in Thailand because of the geographical proximity between
them and their cultural and traditional similarities.

Besides, the governments of the four countries have a history of
cooperation and good relations, he added.

The Thai government and its Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour have
come up with regulations on how to deal with the illegal workers from the
three countries.

An agreement is expected to be signed between the Cambodian authorities
and their Thai counterparts pertaining to the Cambodians who are now
working illegally in Thailand.

To expedite matters, the Royal Government of Cambodia will be setting up
an inter-ministerial committee to study the problem of the Cambodian
workers who are living and working illegally in Thailand.

Suy Sem, the Secretary of State for the Cambodian Ministry of Social
Welfare, Labour and Veterans said that it has been decided that once the
committee's study is completed, the agreement will be signed between the
Thai and Cambodian authorities to legalise the status of all the illegal
workers from each country working in the other.

The regulations will allow Cambodian workers to stay in Thailand for a
two-year period. Thai workers will also be allowed to be employed in
Cambodia for a similar length of time.

After the two years is up, the workers will be sent back to their own
countries.

However, those who wish to stay on in Thailand will have to go through
the correct procedures for obtaining a permit to remain legally in
Thailand.

Prasitt explained that in the case of Cambodian workers who want to
remain in Thailand after the two-year period is up, both governments are
in the process of drawing up further regulations so that these workers
can continue working in Thailand in accordance with Thai law.

These conditions will require all the Cambodian workers in Thailand to
register with the Ministry of Social Welfare within a 90-day period from
Sept 1, 1996.

The Thai authorities will issue "living permission cards" and working
cards to these individuals. The workers will also be required to pay 500
bahts to the Thai Ministry of Social Welfare, 1,000 bahts a year for the
working permission card and another 1,000 bahts as "guarantee fee" which
is refundable after the two years is up.

Prasitt added that most of the illegal immigrants in Thailand were from
Myanmar, numbering about 400,000. There are 10,000 from Laos and about
200,000 from India, China and Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, there are about 1,000 Thai workers in Cambodia, of
which only 189 have registered with Cambodia's Department of Labour.

Suy Sem said however that all foreign workers who come to Cambodia have
to register with the kingdom's Ministry of Social Welfare. This, of
course, includes the illegal Thai workers in Cambodia.

Suy Sem explained that there are many legal and illegal workers in the
kingdom, most seeking employment with foreign companies, while there are
others who only stay for short periods while waiting for jobs in third
countries.

The Thai government has said that over 30,000 Cambodian workers have
entered Thailand without the necessary travel documents and are thus
illegally employed.

Of the total number of illegal workers, about 3,000 are in the
construction sector, while 2,000 are involved in the agricultural sector.

According to the Thai authorities, most of the illegal workers are
employed in the ports or as construction workers, especially in Bangkok
and Pra Chun Bory province.

Jobs are more easily available in these areas and the workers can earn
at least 160 bahts a day.

Thai government officials claim that the actual number of illegal
Cambodian workers could very well be far more than the statistics show.
The problem of the illegal workers was discussed last month by Suy Sem
and Prasitt.

According to Prasitt, Thai law now provides for the immediate deportation
of illegal workers, whether or not the Cambodian government is aware of
the situation.

Suy Sem, meanwhile, said he will brief the Royal Government on the
matter.

He added that he personally cannot accept that there are over 30,000
illegal Cambodian immigrants living in Thailand.

He explained that in any event, his ministry alone cannot deal with the
issue and needs the inter-ministerial committee to decide whether or not
the so-called Cambodian illegal workers are indeed Khmer.

Cambodia: US may help rebuild highway

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The United States has expressed interest in helping rebuild a national
highway to Pailin, an important trading town that until about a month ago
was a stronghold of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and off-limits to most
Cambodians.

"The US ambassador told Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen that his
government would like to help repair the road to develop the area," said
Om Yu Tiang, an adviser to the co-premier.

The 85km stretch links Pailin and the north-western provincial capital
of Battambang. Pailin is under the control of the Khmer Rouge dissidents
who broke away from hard-liners loyal to Pol Pot in August and are
negotiating peace with the government.

Cambodia: Abortions a major cause of death

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

Complications arising from abortions, both legal and illegal, have become
one of the major causes of death among Cambodian women.

While statistics from the Ministry of Health show that about 2,000 women
die every year from abortion related problems, studies by the Family
Planning International Assistance (FPIA) claim that the number is more
like 200,000.

According to the FPIA study, a large number of abortions are conducted
under deplorable conditions and underscores the desperate circumstances
pregnant women are faced with such as the lack of efficient and reliable
family planning services.

Abortion, being illegal in Cambodia (with a few exceptions), has created
legal obstacles for women who want to terminate pregnancies. Thus, in
desperation, women are forced to resort to the services of the untrained
and unskilled, often with fatal results, the FPIA study said.

Kien Sereyphal of the Cambodian Women's Development Association (CWDA),
explained the local problem.

"The abortions are often performed by trained birth attendants, in
ill-equipped homes. When complications arise, these attendants do not
have sufficient expertise or training to salvage the situation and save
the mother," she said.

The solution to the problem, according to the study, lies in family
planning.

"No law, no religion has proven to be effective when it comes to
decreasing the number of abortions. Only increased access to reliable
family planning services, combined with high quality information can do
this," the FPIA revealed.

Successful planning programmes take time to be formulated and then
implemented and could not emerge within a matter of months. Accordingly,
for the programme to be truly effective, the attitude of parents towards
children - the number they intend to have and the age gap between each
child - and the opportunities they may have later in life, must all be
examined. "This all begins at birth," the study pointed out.

The FPIA study also revealed that the problem is not restricted to
Cambodia.

An estimated 25 million abortions are performed each year in developing
countries, most under unsafe conditions.

Among married women, who do not want to get pregnant, at least 100
million face an unmet need for contraception. Most of these women live
in the third world.

Every year, about 500,000 women die from pregnancy related causes.

"This means that every minute of the day a women dies as a result of her
pregnancy or in childbirth," Paul Hamilton, a country representative of
the FPIA, said.

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath donated bicycles, clothes and
study materials to 260 students from poor families around Phnom Penh last
week.

Other students, who were not given bicycles, received cash amounting to
100,000 riels each from the king and queen.

King Sihanouk advised the students to study hard in the new school year,
not just for their own good, but also for the future good of the nation.

The bicycles were donated by the Japanese government.

Cambodia: 'leng Sary had no power'

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, once believed to be the second and third
most powerful men in the Khmer Rouge, were, in fact, powerless.

Every ministry and institution of the Democratic Kampuchea government was
under the control of Pol Pot, the shadowy leader of the Khmer Rouge, said
Nhem Ein, the former information officer of the Maoist group.

The only other people allowed to make decisions and implement them were
Noun Chea, who was the president of the National Assembly, and Son Sen,
the deputy prime minister and defence minister.

Nhem Ein said Ieng Sary, who was the foreign minister, had no authority
to decide on anything. He described the activities in the ministry at
that time as "sluggish".

He said Khieu Samphan, who was the head of state, was also a powerless
man.

"Many Cambodians liked him (Khieu Samphan) but they did not like Pol
Pot's way of ruling the country," he said.

"However, he had no power so he had to follow Pol Pot," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: No more lessons on genocide

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

The break-up of the Khmer Rouge promises to change the political scenario
in Cambodia. The break-up of the Khmer Rouge has also changed what
children learn in school.

For a start, there will no longer be any references to the genocidal
regime of the Maoist group.

All illustrations and text of Khmer Rouge atrocities have been removed
from the textbooks for pupils in the first, sixth and seventh grades.

In addition, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has instructed
teachers to discontinue lessons on the subject in all other grades even
though such references have yet to be expunged from the textbooks.

In place of this subject, pupils will be given instructions on the
environment, human rights and moral instructions.

Stories of the genocide carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol
Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were contained in the textbooks
published by the State of Cambodia government, which ousted the maoist
regime in 1979.

These textbooks contained criticisms of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror
and pupils studied the atrocities committed by the Pol Potists. In the
textbooks, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan were also portrayed as
traitors of the country.

The vice-director of the research institute of the education ministry,
Ly Somony, said one of the subjects, Social Studies, carried lessons on
the Khmer Rouge's atrocities. It explained how the Khmer Rouge tortured
and starved Cambodians during their rule of the country from 1975 to
1979.

Under the Cambodian education system, there are six grades - 1 to 6 - in
the primary school level. At the secondary school level are Grades 7 to
9 and the high school level are Grades 10 to 12.

Ly Somony said textbooks to be given to pupils in Grades 1, 6 and 7 will
no longer contain anything on the Khmer Rouge. The new school year
started last month, but the pupils are only expected to get their books
this month.

"The word `genocide' will no longer be seen in the newly published
textbooks," he said.

However, the move to remove all references to the Khmer Rouge in school
textbooks has also drawn some criticisms.

Ly Somony said he had been approached by several intellectuals who held
the view that subjects on the genocide should remain in the school
syllabus.

He said the intellectuals, some of whom were also from the ministry, had
reminded him that many Cambodians were killed and the country was ruined
during Pol Pot's reign and that "we should not forget the horrible
regime".

He said his institute had conveyed the message to the minister but there
has yet to be any response. "We are only the writers of the books, and
we always abide by the government's policy," he said.

The minister, Tol Lah, could not be reached for comment as he is out of
the country, but a ministry official said the government was not likely
to go back on its decision to discontinue lessons on the Khmer Rouge.

"The Royal Government is carrying out a policy of national reconciliation
and thus would like to see that such subjects on Khmer Rouge atrocities
be removed from the education syllabus," the official said.

Meanwhile, the deputy director of the ministry's publishing house, Koeu
Nay Leang, said the new books for the three grades would be printed by
the third week of this month.

He said a total of 1.28 million books in eight subjects would be printed
for pupils in the first grade. In addition, there are 410,000 books in
five subjects for pupils of Grade 6 and 210,000 books in 12 subjects for
those in Grade 7.

All books are given free of charge to the pupils.

Ly Somony said that next year, the ministry would publish new books for
pupils in the second and eighth grades while those in the fourth and 10th
grades would get new books in 1999.

In the year 2000, new books will be published for pupils in Grades 5 and
11 and in 2001, a new edition of the books will be published for pupils
in Grade 6 while pupils in Grade 12 will also be given new books without
the subject on the Khmer Rouge.

Cambodia: Charting the nation's course

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Mehran Chinniah

It is not easy locating the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace
(CICP).

Squeezed between the rows of pre-fabricated cabins at the Government
Palace at Wat Phnom, the office is a legacy of the United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia - a memorial to the Third World.

You have to manoeuvre past numerous potholes and puddles of water before
arriving at the CICP workplace where the wooden pathway creaks with each
step.

Founded in June 1994, the CICP's objectives are to help the government
in its public policy and nurture regional and international cooperation.

The institute thrives on cutting corners: it operates with a skeletal
staff of four. Materials that need to be photocopied have first to be
verified and personal phone calls are limited to two three-minute
conversations per day.

"If you have to talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend, don't do it on
company time," reads a terse memo on the wall.

The CICP's frugality is as a good a metaphor as any for CICP's place in
Cambodia's lengthy list of non-governmental organisations. It is a small
think tank that has grown in a manner more spectacular than most would
have imagined.CICP executive director Kao Kim Hourn has a decidedly
simple explanation for all this.

Sitting at his cluttered desk, dressed in his trademark white,
short-sleeved shirt and tie, he says: "We are small because small
sometimes means beautiful. We are small so we can work effectively and
move faster."

It is no mere puff. In the short two years since CICP was established,
it has organised five major conferences and seminars in Cambodia,
produced more than 10 papers and journals and has presented more than 20
working papers in conferences throughout the region.

In Kao's words, the research papers, seminars and conferences "will help
us to re-think what we have been thinking". "That's what we have been
doing. Whether it is conferences, seminars, workshops or lectures, we
provide a forum for consultation and dialogue for policy makers and
academics on one hand, and students and the younger generation, on the
other, to bridge the gap," he said.

The research, Kao said, is not for research's sake. "The research we do
is to give some new ideas and perspectives to our public policy. It is
the future that we are worried about."Its recent publication - the
Cambodian Journal of International Affairs - is the first publication of
its kind by any non-governmental organisation in the kingdom.

But the feather in its cap is, by far, CICP's appointment as the seventh
member of Asean-ISIS (Institute of Strategic and International Studies),
a prestigious group of policy-oriented think tanks.

The other six are ISIS Malaysia, ISIS Thailand, the Singapore Institute
of International Affairs, the Institute of Strategic and Developmental
Studies Indonesia and Institute of International Relations Vietnam.

The CICP will be Cambodia's official representative in the South-East
Asian economic grouping in March next year.

It is, fellow NGOs concur, a fitting testimony to CICP's efforts in
Cambodia's foreign policy in the international arena.

Says Kao: "It means that we are part of an important regional process.
We will be able to assist the government better in terms of ideas and
vision."

Clearly, the future lies with Asean, as far as the CICP is concerned. The
world is working towards regionalism and Cambodia has to be part of the
group to develop quickly, Kao said.

Although Cambodia will become a full member of the regional grouping in
July 1997, the CICP's work is far from finished.

"CICP's work is now at the next level. We have to reach out to more
people in our meetings, seminars and conferences. We have to look beyond
Asean, to our relations with the United Nations, with the European Union,
Apec and WTO.

"The role of forward looking diplomacy is vital if Cambodia wants to
protect its interests. We cannot be left out. We have to be part of a
region that is changing and developing quickly," Kao said.

Cambodia: CICP mission statement

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, founded in 1994, is
a non-profit, non-partisan, and non-governmental policy-oriented
institute.

It is dedicated to cultivating greater understanding of national,
regional and international issues that are of concern to
Cambodia.Cambodia is re-entering the world community at a time of
unprecedented opportunity and complexity.

The institute believes that internal and external stability are necessary
for the future peace and prosperity of Cambodia. Thus, there is an acute
need to comprehend domestic issues in isolation as well as in relation
to regional and international conditions.

To fill this need, CICP fosters both a domestic and a South-East Asian
constructive dialogue among government officials, international
organisations, scholars and the private sector on issues of security,
foreign policy, conflict resolution, economics and national development.

Cambodia: Destruction of mines on record

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

A British photographer Tim Page, has started documenting the destruction
of Cambodia's mine fields to help highlight the situation at the
international conference on mines.

Four of Page's images will be carried on the Internet home page of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

This will coincide with the up-coming Canadian government-sponsored mine
conference.

The Ottawa conference Towards a Global Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines
will gather representatives from the 43 countries that have supported a
global ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel landmines.

"This is the first time the Red Cross has gone public on an issue, a
spokesman of the ICRC, Gordon Bates said.

He added that the impetus came from ICRC medical teams weary of
contending with the grisly damage done by mines.

"It was a mutiny from our own surgeons who told us that we could not go
forward unless we took some kind of ethical stance," Bates said.

For Page, who was a war-time photographer injured by a mine in Vietnam
in 1969, the campaign has a personal significance.

"When I come back here, I am terrified," he told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Cambodia.

"To take pictures of people with their limbs blown away, everyday it gets
more difficult," Page added.

Cambodia had drafted a law banning the use and purchase of anti-personnel
landmines, but the legislation is not expected to be passed soon.

There are an estimated four to six million landmines in Cambodia, making
it one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.

Cambodia became a signatory to the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT)
in New York on Sept 26 1996, when Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Relations Ung Huot signed on behalf of the kingdom.

Cambodia's position on the question of nuclear weapons has always been
that complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and the destruction of
existing ones is crucial to world peace, a press release from Cambodia's
permanent mission to the United Nations said.

Cambodia was one of the sponsors of the resolution that was presented by
Australia on Sept 10 to the United Nations.

Cambodia: It's only natural

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Leak Ratna

There are no additives or chemicals. It is cheap and it is easily
available. It is the Cambodian roll-up, a non-filtered, 100 per cent
tobacco cigarette and it can be found just about anywhere in the capital
city of Phnom Penh, wherever a roadside vendor seats herself.

Last week, Lifetimes went looking for these cigarettes and found that
most of the vendors are women.

These women deal with the tobacco suppliers, they buy the paper, they
prepare the flour-based paste to stick the cigarette paper together, they
spread the tobacco on the paper and roll them up into foot-long
cigarettes and then cut them into pieces of four or five, and then they
sell them.

These women always look very busy. Several of them can be seen sitting
at their makeshift stalls under the trees on the corner of Samdech
Monireth Boulevard and Jawaharlal Nehru Boulevard, near the Olympic
Stadium, and they will be rolling the cigarettes.

One of these vendors is 53-year-old Sok Ouy who has been selling the
roll-ups for six years already. Everyday, for 15 hours a day, from 6am
to 9pm, she sits under the tree selling the hand-rolled cigarettes.

Her fingers may seem gnarled, but they are nimble. She call roll 500
cigarettes in an hour. At 100 riels for five cigarettes, that means
50,000 riels worth of cigarettes.

Sok Ouy sells anything between 500 and 2,000 cigarettes per day. After
deducting her costs, she makes between 3,000 and 15,000 riels. In a week,
she can sell about 50kg worth of tobacco.

Contrary to popular belief, smokers of the Cambodian roll-ups come from
all walks of life.

"It is not true that only the poor people smoke these cigarettes. I also
have some very wealthy customers," Sok Ouy said.

"They say the cigarette has a distinctive flavour, is strong and smooth.
They can get full satisfaction with just a few puffs," she added.

Although she has never had someone instruct her on rolling cigarettes,
with regular practice over the years, Sok Ouy has made it into an art
form.

"I watched and I learnt. The old hands were always there doing it and
after having seen it done a few times, I did it too," she said
matter-of-fact.

Despite the fact that she only has a makeshift stall at the roadside, Sok
Ouy also has to worry about overheads.

To keep her spot on the roadside, she has to pay a daily "rental" of
1,000 riels to the owner of the house in front of which her stall is
located. She also has to pay 100 per day to the contractor who keeps the
streets clean and a weekly tax of 500 riels to the local authorities.

The tobacco is delivered to Sok Ouy by the supplier. She buys in bulk -
500kg of tobacco at a time, at 6,000 riels per kilogramme.

The paper can be bought from the markets, already cut into the correct
size, at 5,000 riels per 10,000 pieces of paper.

The cooked flour costs 600 riels per 500g. The flour is boiled until it
becomes thick like a porridge. This gluey concoction is then used to
stick the cigarette paper together. The "rolling instrument" cost about
15,000 riels.

Selling cigarettes has proven to be more lucrative for Sok Ouy. Before
she embarked on this venture, she used to sell banana fritters.

"It was too difficult selling banana fritters. I had to do everything by
myself," she complained.

However, its does not seem very much easier selling the roll-up
cigarettes. During the 15 hours at work, Sok Ouy is bent over rolling
cigarettes.

In addition, she has to see that her tobacco supplier is paid every week.
The amount of money she pays the supplier, of course, depends on the
amount she earns each week. She only takes delivery of her next
consignment of 500kg of tobacco when she pays in full.

These days, however, life is a little easier for Sok Ouy. She now has two
assistants to help her roll up the cigarettes.

"I have found that I cannot do this for long anymore. Bending up and down
while rolling the cigarettes has given me a backache and a pain in the
wrist," she said.

She pays her two workers a salary of 30,000 riels per month. In addition,
they are provided meals. The work in Sok Ouy's house, located not far
away from her stall. Her husband also helps.

"I need to work hard for the sake of my family. I have four children -
three boys and a girl. My eldest, aged 26, is a policeman but his salary
is very low. My other children are not working," she said.

Her youngest child is already 18 years old. Her three younger children
are still living with her.

Another one of these women entrepreneurs is Phim Sokoun, 46, who comes
from Kompong Cham province.

Phim Sokoun is still new to the trade as she took over the business from
her daughter who retired after her marriage six months ago.

She buys about 50kg of tobacco a time. Everyday she rolls cigarettes from
7am to 2.30pm. Phim Sokoun, still relatively inexperienced, can roll only
about 100 cigarettes per day.

She is further hampered by the fact that her cigarette roller has the
capacity for only one cigarette at a time. She earns between 2,000 and
10,000 riels a day.

"The best type of tobacco comes from Kompong Cham province," she said.

Phim Sokoun lives with her daughter in Steng Meanchey district, Phnom
Penh. She has nine children, five of whom live in Phnom Penh while the
other four live in Kompong Cham with her husband. The oldest is 28 and
the youngest is 10.

Phim Sokoun seems to accept her lot in life. "I do not have the kind of
money to venture into the world of big business. That is why I chose to
be in this business. It is more profitable than selling sweets in Kompong
Cham," she said, smiling.

Cambodia: No let-up on illegal logging: Govt officials and military
personnel also involved, says minister

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Reaksmey Kongkea

In addition to waging a guerrilla war against the Royal Government in the
past three years, the Khmer Rouge was also causing a major environmental
problem - the depletion of the kingdom's forest cover.

However, the mass defection and rebellion of the guerrilla fighters
against the Maoist group's hard-line leadership has not eased the
pressure on Cambodia's natural heritage.

Areas formerly under Khmer Rouge control are still losing their forests
through illegal logging and the culprits now are local government
officials and military personnel, according to officials in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

These provincial officials and military officers are, in fact, conspiring
with foreign traders and loggers to exploit the Cambodian forests for
profits, the minister Tao Seng Hour told the Cambodia Times.

These illegal activities are rampant in the north-western provinces of
Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong and as a result, vast areas of
forests have been destroyed, the deputy director of the Provincial
Forestry and Fisheries Department, Kim Samol said.

He said the illegal loggers, who used to work with the Khmer Rouge,
continued to fell trees and transporting the logs across the borders to
Thailand and Laos.

These areas, he said, were formerly under the Khmer Rouge, but came under
the Royal Government's control near the end of last year.

Kim Samol said that in some cases, soldiers of the Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) were cutting down the trees and transporting the logs to
foreign timber traders.

"Thousands of dollars are collected each day from the sale of the logs
and the money goes into the pockets of corrupt government officials, he
said.

A foreign forestry expert in the ministry alleged that the illegal
loggers were, in fact, RCAF soldiers who were conspiring with provincial
officials to cut down new trees and transporting the logs across the
border.

"Their actions are illegal and causing the destruction of the forests.
It is also against the decision of the government not to export anymore
new logs," the expert, who declined to be named, added.

(Earlier this year, the government had stated that it would not allow
anymore exports of logs once the existing stock of one million cubic
metres have been sold. Eight Thai companies have been given permits to
export the logs, which had been cut earlier but not exported yet.)

He said the areas which had been badly affected by the illegal logging
activities were forests in Kompong Thom and Koh Kong.

Sources in Preah Vihear province have alleged that each night, the logs
would be transported in four or five trucks to the border where they were
loaded into waiting boats to be sent to Thailand.

The sources added that hundreds of hectares of forests have been
destroyed as a result of the illegal logging operations.

A report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries shows
that about 30 logging concessions, covering a total area of 6.4 million
hectares, have been given out by the government.

The foreign forestry expert estimated that this was roughly equivalent
to the kingdom's remaining forest cover.

All sides in the Cambodian civil conflict have, in the past, sold timber
to help fund their military operations.

The Khmer Rouge reportedly earned millions of dollars every month, part
of which they used to buy arms, from selling logging and gems mining
concessions in areas under their control to Thai companies.

However, the forestry expert blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the
country's deforestation, especially around Pailin where their
headquarters is located.

"The Khmer Rouge are the main factors in the destruction of the forests
around Pailin. They also cooperate with foreigners to exploit gemstones
and these activities cause environmental deterioration," he said.

However, the expert admitted that the ill-disciplined elements in the
government forces were also responsible for the illegal logging
operations. He alleged that sometimes they also deal with the Khmer
Rouge.

Tao Seng Hour said the Thai and Cambodian governments had agreed to
cooperate in efforts to stamp out the illegal export of timber to
Thailand.

He said his ministry was taking action to stop the illegal logging
operations by local officials and military personnel. He said action
would also be taken to stop the export of logs and sawn timber from Preah
Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong provinces.

However, he did not outline the measures that the ministry was taking.

"If we find proof that local officials are involved in these illegal
activities and conspiring with foreign traders, we have to fine them and
put them in jail," Tao Seng Hour added.

Funcinpec wants Sirivudh to return to Cambodia

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

The announcement by the co-premiers that the former Khmer Rouge number
two man Ieng Sary will be pardoned has renewed calls for the return of
Prince Norodom Sirivudh.

The steering committee of the Funcinpec party has urged its president,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to invite his half-uncle to return to Cambodia.

Prince Sirivudh, a former secretary-general of the party, was exiled to
France after being accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate Second
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen in December last year.

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court tried Prince Sirivudh, a half-brother of
King Norodom Sihanouk, in absentia. He was found guilty and sentenced to
10 years in prison.

At a two-day meeting of the party's national council, the Funcinpec
steering committee urged Prince Ranariddh, who is the First Prime
Minister, to write a letter to Prince Sirivudh to invite him back to the
kingdom.

Committee member Lu Lay Sreng also proposed that the exiled prince be
allowed to rejoin the party's steering committee.

He also expressed hope that King Sihanouk would grant an amnesty to the
prince considering that Ieng Sary, who had been found guilty and
sentenced to death on charges of killing people during the four-year
genocidal regime, would also be pardoned.

"Compared to Ieng Sary, Prince Sirivudh's case is less serious. If we
want national reconciliation, the prince should be granted amnesty," Lu
Lay Sreng said.

He said that although the National Assembly had stripped Prince Sirivudh
of his immunity, he was officially still a member of the house and
remained a very important person to the Funcinpec.

He said that in a letter to the prince recently, the party had urged him
to write to the king to ask for amnesty.

Prince Ranariddh said it was now up to the prince to request for a pardon
from the king.

"If there is a request from Prince Sirivudh in his own handwriting, I
believe the king will pardon him. The Funcinpec will support him," he
told reporters at the Funcinpec headquarters in Phnom Penh after the
meeting last week.

To questions from newsmen, he said the decision to pardon Ieng Sary would
ensure that his half-uncle would also be granted amnesty.

"Whether Hun Sen agrees or not, it is up to him, but I will support
Prince Sirivudh and it is my understanding that King Sihanouk will also
agree to the pardon," he added.

"A pardon for Prince Sirivudh will be justice for him and for the
Funcinpec party. If Ieng Sary can be pardoned, why not Prince Sirivudh,
who has not even killed anyone?" Prince Ranariddh asked.

He said the prince could resume his duties as member of parliament and
rejoin the Funcinpec steering committee, but he would not be reappointed
party secretary-general.

"We have already appointed Loy Sim Chheang to the post," he added.

At the meeting, the members also unanimously approved the appointment of
an additional 13 members to the steering committee, bringing the total
membership now to 33. The move is to strengthen the party for the next
general elections in 1998.

The new members are Princess Marie Ranariddh, Hong Sun Huoth, Tao Seng
Hour, Chum Chheang, Man Bunthon, Chea Rithy Chhuth, Keang Vang, Ho Sok,
Ek Serywath, Kheat Vandy, Khan Saveourn, Ly Seng Hong and Sum Nipha.

First deputy secretary-general Chhim Seak Leng said the party needed more
active officials to carry out its activities and to prepare for the
elections.

He said the decision to enlarge the steering committee was made to
overcome the problem of the lack of quorum when meetings had to be held
to discuss important internal issues.

The party also adopted several resolutions. They are:

- to adopt a political platform outlining the principles and guidelines
in the implementation of political, economic, social and cultural
programmes;

- to nominate Prince Ranariddh to continue his "noble mission" as premier
of the government for a second term after the general elections of 1998;

- to determine that the general elections will take place in 1998 as
stipulated in the constitution;

- to appeal to all international organisations, in particular the United
Nation, and all friendly countries to send personnel to observe the
preparation and conduct of the elections, the counting of ballots and to
provide the necessary technical assistance, and

- to appeal to all Cambodian political parties to appoint and make known
to the public their candidate for the post of premier.

Cambodia: Protest against release

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Kong Vara

PHNOM PENH: The request made by King Norodom Sihanouk for the release of
prisoners has came under protest from University and Faculty students.

The protest is in the form of a petition dated 23 October and addressed
to the King, a copy of which was made available to Cambodia Today.

"Recently, we heard and read your message on the request made to the
Justice Ministry for a list of prisoners to be released.

"The message has aroused our concern over security and safety of people
in the whole society of Cambodia," stated the two-page petition signed
by 8 students, representing eight institutions of higher learning here.

"The amnesty could lead to the increase of robbery, terrorism, murder and
other offenses, for perpetrators would assume that after their
prosecution, there will be a pardon granted by the King," continued the
petition.

On 19 October, King Sihanouk sent a letter to Justice Minister Chem
Snguon to request the draft of a Royal Decree to render amnesty to those
who are being imprisoned across the Kingdom.

However, the third paragraph of the letter, bore inflexible contents on
the nature of the criminals to be freed.

"Concerning criminals that could not be freed from imprisonment, for they
might pose enormous danger to the national and international societies
please, Your Excellency, request the two Prime Ministers for the names
of these criminals," the King said.

In an unrelated issue, the students are also opposing the granting of an
amnesty to Prince Norodom Sirivuddh.

"We have read and heard about this.

"If the request is true, we would like to state that he should not be
pardoned," the petition stressed.

However, several politicians share the opinion that amnesty should be
granted to Prince Sirivuddh given the fact that Ieng Sary, the former
Brother Number 2 of Pol Pot's regime has been granted amnesty.

"If the King wants to pardon Prince Sirivuddh, no one can object to this
as we are all committed to follow His Majesty's advise," said MP Kem
Sokha, from Son San's BLDP faction,when speaking to Cambodia Today.

"Between Ieng Sary and Prince Sirivuddh, who has carried out more
destruction to the national interest and humanity?" the MP questioned.

Prince Sirivuddh was prosecuted by the Phnom Penh Court and sentenced to
10 years imprisonment in absentia on charges of illegal arms possession
in February this year. He was sent into exile in a deal arranged by King
Sihanouk.

Cambodia: UN celebrates 51st Anniversary

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

The 51st anniversary of the United Nations Day was held yesterday at the
Council for Development of Cambodia (CDC).

The celebration was attended by Benny Widyono, Representative of the UN
Secretary General, and representatives of UNDP, UNFPA, UNESCO, UNICEF,
WHO, UNHCR, ILO, FAO and WFP.

The documents of the great achievements recorded in the past 50 years by
the United Nations were also handed out to visitors on the occasion.

The UN Secretary General in his speech read here said that the United
Nations remains as the place to solve problems beyond reach of any single
state.

He commented that the United Nations must continue to build on its
success and must not be deterred by setbacks. The UN have to fulfill its
tasks of reform and rationalization to strengthen an improve
international cooperation.

He added that the UN will help all people, men, women and children in
bringing about peace, development and democracy.

The United Nations was established on 24th October 1945 with only 51
member states. Now, the UN have 185 members. The key role of the United
Nations is to bring peace through reconciliation and peace keeping
mission as well as fighting against violence through upgrading the human
rights, providing shelters and humanitarian aid to war victims, said the
press release.

The release further said most governments in the world recognized that
economic and social development is the key factor to consolidate peace.

Since its establishment, the world body has been concentrating on the
development of economy of the developing countries.

In Cambodia, the United Nations have an important role in national
reconciliation and peace consolidation.

The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is a
historic mission in Cambodia in organising the general election leading
to the setting up of a democratic government. After the end of UNTAC's
mandate on 24th September 1993, the UN has been cooperating with the
Royal Government of Cambodia in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
the country.

In 1996, the United Nation pledged to provide US$54 million to Cambodia
for continuing its national reconstruction efforts.

The UN also donated US$1 million in an aid package, comprising financial
and material assistance to the flood victims in Cambodia recently.

Cambodia: Marubeni urged to construct industrial zone

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy has called on the
giant Japanese company, Marubeni Corporation to consider the development
of the country's first industrial zone in Sihanoukville.

Minister Pou Sothirak, when speaking to a 24 member Japanese delegation
said that there was an urgent need for such a zone but to date, no
corporation or organisation has come forward with concrete plans for the
development of such a zone.

"Marubeni could seriously consider this. Previously, Thai based Ban Chang
Group had carried out a feasibility study on the proposed industrial
zone.

"However, they have yet to confirm whether they are going to go ahead
with the project or otherwise," Sothirak said.

He said that there were ample opportunities for Japanese corporations to
develop Cambodia's agro-based and fisheries sector.

"There is ample arable land for agricultural development and since Japan
is a huge importer of food products, it could use Cambodia as a supply
base."

He added that current laws enabled foreign investors to lease land for
periods up to 70 years. He also pointed out that there were large
quantities of logs which have been left abandoned since the Royal
Government ban on log exports.

"Japanese corporations could consider the establishment of furniture or
other wood-based factories to take advantage of the availability of
timber," Sothirak stressed.

As for urging Japanese assistance in power generation, the Minister of
Energy said that though there was insufficient power supply at present,
the situation is expected to improve in the coming year, facilitated to
a large extend by a US$70 million ADB loan.

The head of the delegation, Marubeni's Masaru Mizuno said that the
Minister's proposals and comments would be discussed both at the
corporate level as well as the Government level.

"We will attempt to persuade our Government to support the carrying out
of a feasibility study on the proposed Sihanoukville Industrial Zone,"
Mizuno said.

Cambodia: Request for return of 1993 ballot papers

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The United Nations Representative here, Benny Widyono said
yesterday that a request for the return of the 1993 ballot papers to
Cambodia has been conveyed to New York.

Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen made the request officially last
Tuesday during the Symposium on the Paris Peace Accord.

"I am awaiting the reply from the United Nations Headquarters in New York
and I do not know what or when the reply will be," he said.

Widyono added that he was unsure as to what happened in the capital
during the last elections as he was based in Siem Reap.

He clarified during a press conference to mark the 51st Anniversary of
the United Nations that the presence of two Prime Ministers was not a
system proposed by UNTAC, the UN authority here at that time.

"That is through the wisdom of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varman
who wanted to see peace and unity return to the Kingdom of Cambodia," he
stressed.

Om Yin Tieng, an advisor to the Second Prime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen
said that the return of the ballot papers were necessary as accusations
of violence, intimidations and deaths have been made.

"The papers are necessary to verify the facts as some of the electoral
results are probably questionable," he said.

First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said earlier in the week
that the system of two Prime Ministers should be abolished to facilitate
efficient governance.

This view is also believed to be shared by Second Prime Minister Samdech
Hun Sen.

Though elections to elect a new government is only scheduled in 1998, the
two main political parties, FUNCINPEC and CPP have been involved in
serious campaigning through work-shops, meetings and public appearance
in many forms.

The commune elections scheduled for 1997 is widely expected to be used
as a yardstick to predict the results of the 1998 general elections.

Cambodia: Nobody can move our people, says Y Chhien

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: The Vice chairman of the Democratic National Union Movement
(DNUM), in charge of military affairs, Y Chhien said that Second Prime
Minister Samdech Hun Sen's assurance on the status of the people here
showed that "nobody" could move the people to other areas.

"Nobody can move them to other camps and nobody can seize our people's
territory which is their own property," Y Chhien, the commander of break-
away Khmer Rouge Division 415 said during the visit of Hun Sen to Pailin.

He added that the people residing in Pailin, Phnom Malai, Samlot, Koh
Kong and Sisophon had to clear the land and these had caused numerous
injuries which later resulted in disablement.

"Numerous others had died because of mines and exposure to killer
diseases such as Malaria and furthermore, the people in these territories
had to sacrifice their lives to preserve their territory during the war,"
he pointed out.

Y Chhien added that given these facts, the Royal Government would surely
protect the people's land and crops, especially since the people had
agreed to abide by the National Constitution promulgated in 1993.

"The ceasefire between the DNUM and the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces
(RCAF) has been in place for two months and the people are delighted as
they no longer have to fear the roar of weapons and gunfire.

"I am sure that our people here and the RCAF are both happy as there is
no more war and killing and Khmers do not have to kill Khmers anymore.

"There is no happiness greater than this one," Y Chhien stressed.

He added that the DNUM and the people here would strive to consolidate
the two month cease-fire to enable it to evolve into a permanent peace
with no losers or victors as Khmer people would be living in harmony.

"In this, we must recognize that the tasks in bringing about national
reconciliation, national unity and putting and end to the war is still
a heavy task.

"Though all our people desire peace, it is unfortunate that the country
has been destroyed to a large extent because of the many years of war and
this has brought to a standstill, development," he said.

Y Chhien added that though there were various ways of ending the war, he
nevertheless was confident of the final result as well as the progress
attained thus far.

He pointed out that these efforts could only push the country forward and
that the momentum will be maintained with no turning back.

"The decisive factor is the will of the whole Khmer nation to stop
spilling the blood of Khmers," he said.

Second Prime Minister Hun Sen said that there was no question of people
living here and elsewhere being moved from their homes and their land.

"Our policy of national reconciliation has drawn many critics, both
locally and abroad.

"However, what is important is for Khmers to resolve their problems among
themselves," Hun Sen said.

He added that politicians should not be branding their fellow Khmers as
puppets of Vietnam, China, Australia, USA and so forth.

"This is an act in futility as it benefits no one and will only fuel
unnecessary hatred among Khmers," Samdech Hun Sen said.

He also added that there may be conflicting views on how to resolve the
problem but what mattered most,was the end result, in this case, the end
of hostilities between Khmers.

"The people in Anlong Veng will be liberated. The hard-liners would have
no where to go and they could not hide for ever as the winds of change
are now blowing through Cambodia," the Second Prime Minister said adding
that the people in the country had suffered enough because of war and
that they were tired of the prolonged suffering.

A member of the break-away family, Mrs Chan Thorn said that she was
delighted that peace is finally settling in Pailin and that family life
could return to normal.

She said that the family has been separated for long as her husband had
to defend their home and the children were fearful of going to school as
war could have broken out at any time.

"I am looking forward to travelling outside Pailin and I hope National
Road 10 would be cleared of mines soon to enable this," Mrs Thorn said.

Her comments were shared by many of the people who had converged on the
area to witness the arrival of the Second Prime Minister and the historic
exchange of greetings between the Second Prime Minister and DNUM leader,
Ieng Sary.

"The once bitter enemies have decided to forgive in the larger interests
of the Cambodian people," a senior RCAF general said, adding that this
was a gift to the country.

Cambodia: 40 RCAF lives for a month's leave

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PAILIN: Each Khmer Rouge soldier must kill as many Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) men as possible to be entitled to lengthy periods of rest
and leave.

"In the event a Khmer Rouge soldier could kill as much as 40 RCAF men a
month, the successful Khmer Rouge soldier is granted one month's leave.

"Our orders are to kill at least one RCAF man a day. The more the merrier
as we can gain longer rest periods.

"If we failed to kill any RCAF men, we would be sent further and further
away to areas where there is a higher chance of fighting and hence
killing, "a Khmer Rouge soldier said.

Shying away from the camera and refusing to reveal his name or home
province, the former Khmer Rouge soldier, now a member of the break-away
faction of division 415 here told this reporter that he did not like
killing fellow Khmers but an order was an order.

"We were at war. We did not have a choice as we have been told repeatedly
that in war, all is fair.

"I had to do the same as I did not want to be separated from my family
or home as we had lost everything during the 1994 RCAF offensive when
they managed to occupy our land for a short spell," the Khmer Rouge
private said.

He again refused to divulge who gave the orders and what the other
penalty for not carrying out their tasks were.

He however said that when he managed to gain some free time, he would
spend it on the many mines in the area, panning for gems and other
precious stones or cultivating rice and other fruits which were all sold
to the Thais, if not consumed by the family or confiscated by the senior
officers.

"I am happy there is no more fighting. I am delighted to note that we do
not have to kill each other anymore and that I and my family can live a
normal life without fearing the "metal rain", diseases and other
threats," the private said.

Cambodia: Deputy Governor dismisses allegations

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath

PHNOM PENH: The First Deputy Governor of Battambang Province, Serey Kosal
has dismissed continuing allegations that he had misappropriated two
statues.

The reports first appeared in local papers about three months ago and
have continued intermittently since then.

"I refute these allegations as they are baseless, irresponsible and
defamatory. I challenge those who made the allegations to prove that I
had misappropriated the two small statues.

"The statues were handed over to the Governor, Ung Samy well before the
allegations started and I am wondering about the motive of those who are
making the allegations," Kosal told Cambodia Today at the Logistics
Department of the Ministry of Defence yesterday.

He said that he had no knowledge as to where Governor Samy was keeping
the statues as it has already been handed over to him and as such, was
not his (Kosal's ) responsibility anymore.

"It is an insult to my position and rank to face such cheap allegations
and I challenge these people to provide the proof," Kosal stressed.

Cambodia: Ties with Malaysia essential says First PM

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: A Malaysian delegation led by Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad
Badawi, Minister of Foreign Affairs has been told that Cambodia's
relation with Malaysia was essential as it (Malaysia) had played a key
role in the country's economic development.

"Cambodia highly values the close cooperation and bilateral relationship
existing with Malaysia, especially the assistance granted during the
country's difficult times," said First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.

He added that as far as the overall political and security situation in
the country is concerned, these had improved significantly as cries for
national reconciliation has increased while the cooperation between the
two prime ministers is also on a better footing.

Prince Ranariddh also urged Malaysia to consider providing scholarships
to Islamic Cambodians to study in Malaysia and added that similar
requests have been made to Indonesia and Brunei.

Datuk Abdullah Badawi said that he would consider the First Prime
Minister's request carefully as it was in line with Malaysia's
aspirations to help provide scholarship to Cambodian students.

"I am happy to see that Malaysian investors are continuing to come to
Cambodia and the facilitation of these investments augured well for the
country," he said.

Later, at a luncheon hosted by Club Malaysia Cambodia, Datuk Abdullah
Badawi said that he was impressed with the developments and progress made
since his last visit here several months ago.

"The Royal Government is moving in the right direction and we will try
and assist in whatever way we can as a peaceful and united Cambodia would
ensure economic prosperity in the entire region.

"Datuk Badawi also had separate meetings with the Second Prime Minister
Samdech Hun Sen and was also granted an audience by His Majesty King
Norodom Sihanouk.

Cambodia: French tourist goes berserk

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Sok Pov

PHNOM PENH: Police officers confirmed that Rodriguez Garcia, a French
national had suffered a nervous break-down after being cheated by his
fellow countryman who took his money.

"The Frenchman went berserk last Wednesday, just after he had confronted
his friend over the missing money "said Sok Bunly who is chief of Sangkat
Wat Phnom Police.

Garcia, 38, had checked into a Guest House on Sisowat Quay of Sangkat Wat
Phnom last Sunday.

He was seen climbing onto the rooftop of a nearby house opposite Post
Office on the corner of Street 13 and 102.

"At about 5 o'clock in the morning, we heard footsteps on our roof and
we suspected that it was burglary attempt.

"As such, I fired few shots to scare away whoever was on my roof, "said
a resident when revealing the probable root cause of the incident to
Cambodia Today.

"After the shooting, the stranger hopped from one rooftop to another as
far as the roof of the building opposite the Post Office," added the
resident.

Garcia was seen tearing several pieces of US and French currency and
tossed the torn bills, together with the untorn ones onto the street
which was jammed with travellers and onlookers.

Cambodia Today witnessed the incident and saw many people including
children vying with one another to grab the cash.

Several minutes later, several French nationals, some of whom are
believed to be from the French Embassy here arrived at the scene with
police.

An ambulance was called in and a ladder was brought to the scene while
some other nationals climbed up the roof to persuade Garcia to come down.

After about four hours of persuasion and talks, a nervous Garcia decided
to climb down. He was wearing pants, bare-bodied and a pouch-belt hung
around his neck.

Nobody could confirm the amount of the money he threw away but several
US$ 10 and 20 bills and some French Francs were collected by onlookers.

"I did not know how much money was destroyed and how much was lost to the
onlookers," said Sok Bunly.

At press time no medical confirmation to substantiate the nervous
breakdown theory was made available.

The police official said that the case was clear cut.

"He was cheated of his money and he was depressed enough to lose control
of himself," he said while others suggested that the Frenchman was a
back-packer who was here to enjoy himself.

Cambodia: First nine months net US$72 million in exports

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: The first nine months of this year, has seen Cambodia
exporting goods worth US$72.1 million through the Generalised System of
Preferences (GSP).

A Ministry of Commerce official said that US$55.8 million of the US$72
million was made through the export of garments. September alone has seen
the export of US$8.3 million worth of goods comprising garments and
related products such as caps and gloves, handicrafts, processed wood,
tobacco leaves and rice of which US$5.4 million were through export of
garments, the official said.

He added that  "the majority of our products was purchased by three
countries - the United Kingdom with US$2.9 million, China with US$1.8
million, and Germany with US$1.2 million".

He added that granting of MFN status to Cambodia will see these exports
figures increasing dramatically in the future as the MFN would enable
Cambodia to export at least 4,000 types of products to the United States.

"Minister of Commerce, Cham Prasidh has also applied for the granting of
GSP status by the United States in addition to bilateral trade
agreements, OPIC and a bilateral investment agreement.

"All these will be a boost for local exports to the United States,
especially agricultural and other assembled products such as garments,"
the official said.

A garment manufacturer who declined identity said that the absence of a
quota for garment exports to the United Kingdom and elsewhere is an added
advantage to enhance exports.

"Other countries enjoy GSP status but have a quota imposed. Cambodia does
not have a quota and we must take advantage of this while it lasts," he
said.

The manufacturer's company is one of the largest exporter of garment
products in the country.

Cambodia: Cottage industries provide 57,000 jobs

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: Cottage industries and small scale industries are providing
some 57,000 employment opportunities to locals.

To date, there are at least 25,350 of such industries in the country and
this has been enhanced by the government's policy to encourage such
labour intensive investments here.

The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy said that the increase in the
number of cottage industries in the country is important as it
contributed significantly to national development.

It added that such industries are basically involved in the production
of consumer goods such as food stuff, metal utensils and agricultural
tools as well as ironworks.

The Ministry added that its main objective is to encourage the dramatic
development of such industries by about 15 percent every year as it is
one of the ways to accelerate industrial development in the country.

The majority of the workshops are in the provinces of Kampong Cham,
Takeo, Kampong Thom, Kandal and as well as the capital city with 6,181,
2,701, 1,961, 1,835 and 1,941 establishments respectively.

The Ministry pointed out that it would further encourage the growth of
such industries and its expansion to cover wood-based products and
foundries to produce grills and other iron based products.

"Just because they are termed as "back-yard"industries by some does not
mean that they do not contribute towards economic growth, employment
creation and the proliferation of downstream industries," the Ministry
said.

It added such industries were the catalyst for the gradual introduction
of similar industries on a larger scale.

"Investments in such industries are coming in and it is a matter of time
when the cottage industries become a major contributor as there is ample
room for expansion and growth in their sector," it said.

Cambodia: Hotels gearing up for competition

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by T. Mohan

PHNOM PENH: The scheduled opening of a five-star hotel early next year,
extensive works to complete a long abandoned project and renovation and
extension works on existing hotels is expected to lead to a price war in
the hotel industry.

A hotel industry official said that the up-market hotel industry will see
keen competition, especially among at least three new entrants, the
Inter-Continental, the Raffles and another hotel, expected to named
Allson (replacing the present Allson) and the existing Sofitel Cambodiana
and the Royal Phnom Penh hotel.

"Sofitel Cambodiana will retain its lustre due to its strategic location
and its position as the only chain hotel which has been in operation for
a long time.

"Location, service and the country's political, economic and security
stability will decide the performance of the hotels," the official said.
He added that in any event, customer loyalty and preference will also be
playing an important role.

The Sofitel Cambodiana hotel is currently undergoing a phase by phase
renovation and refurbishment exercise while the Royal Phnom Penh has
already completed its extension project.

Cambodia: 5th Anniversary of Paris Accord celebrated

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Thet Sambath and Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia celebrated the 5th Anniversary of the Paris Peace
Accord on Wednesday with renewed calls for reconciliation, unity and
development.

President of the National Assembly, Samdech Chea Sim, who presided at the
celebrations attended by the two Prime Ministers, members of the
diplomatic corps and foreign dignitaries said that October 23 was a
historic day as it had paved the path towards peace and national unity
and the end to destruction and war.

"The Paris Peace Accord notably brought peace and national unification
and also saw an international treaty that recognized Cambodia as an
independent, sovereign, neutral and nonaligned country with territorial
integrity.

"We must always commemorate this day in order to help our young
generation to remember their own history which has been filled with
tragedy and heroism so that they will remain conscientious of their duty
towards their country," Chea Sim said in his address.

Adding that the children of the country would definitely have a bright
future, Chea Sim pointed out that the nation was eternally grateful to
the International Community and the United Nations which had brought
about the peace in the country.

"The combined forces of FUNCINPEC Party, the CPP, BLDP, Molinaka and
other political parties, following the high desire of His Majesty the
King and the constitution, the supreme law of the state, has become a
vivid driving force behind the exercise of the policy for national
reunification, peace and national reconstruction," he said.

"In just three years, social developments in various aspects have
flourished throughout the country though some hard-line Khmer Rouge
rebels continue their action to destroy the people.

But this group, either on its own or some other form, will still be
moving towards self-destruction as the Cambodian people want peace,
rehabilitation, reconstruction and development and will no longer allow
themselves to be cheated," he said.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ung Huot said
that despite the many challenges faced by the Royal Government, the
achievements thus far, since the historical day in 1991, has gone far
beyond the hope of the architects of the Paris Peace Agreement.

"Cambodia not only returned to a state of normalcy but also succeeded to
go from the phase of national rehabilitation to the phase of national
reconstruction and development.

"The country is also making plans to carry out the local elections in
1997 and the general elections in 1998," Ung Huot said. The Secretary
General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros Ghali said that the peace
accord served as an eloquent testimony to what the international
community could achieve when there is unity of will.

"The international community continues to help Cambodia build upon the
gains made during UNTAC and the emphasis of our role has rightly shifted
from that of being Cambodia's guardian to that of being the country's
friends.

"Without doubt, the biggest contribution to the country's rebirth has
been the Cambodians themselves who are setting in place and strengthening
the elements of a civil society whilst beginning to reap the dividends
of an ever-strengthening economy," the UN Secretary General said.

He added that challenges lied ahead but the UN was confident that the
Royal Government and the people are prepared to tackle them.

Boutros Boutros Ghali added that the United Nations will provide help in
the coordination of technical assistance for the forthcoming elections
and that several member states had already agreed to assist in the
process.

"In short, the future will depend upon Cambodia's ability to build upon
the achievements of the past half decade: namely its economic
rejuvenation, national reconciliation, universal respect for human rights
and the maintenance of political pluralism," he said.

Foreign dignitaries who gathered in front of the Royal Palace to
participate in the celebrations were representatives from Malaysia,
Australia, United States of America, Brunei, Lao PDR, Thailand and
Vietnam.

Ranariddh says reconciliation comes first

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Has Sam Ath

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh said that
national reconciliation must be achieved before all else as it was the
key to political and security stability. Speaking to an Asia Foundation
delegation led by Lucian Pye he stressed reconciliation with the Khmer
Rouge would lead to a complete ceasefire in fighting and this augured
well for national development.

"However, the criminals responsible for the death of millions of
Cambodians in the seventies must face an international court for their
actions," he said.

Prince Ranariddh pointed out that reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge and
trial for those responsible for the genocide were two separate issues.

"We can forgive but not forget," he said.

The First Prime Minister went on to brief the delegation on the various
challenges being faced in the country such as rejuvenating the education
sector, preparing for the forthcoming commune and general elections as
well as human rights issues.

He said that education is the key to resolving the human rights issue as
it would help strengthen democracy, social values and this in turn would
lead to greater respect for human rights.

"Our police, armed forces and the members of the military police must be
trained in these aspects so that they can uphold the law, justice and the
freedom of the people," Prince Ranariddh said, adding that human resource
development was another area where attention is needed immediately,
stressing that Cambodia's imminent entry into ASEAN would require
immediate upgrading of human resources and capacity development.

As far as the election is concerned, the Prince said the communal and
general elections must be held in 1997 and 1998 respectively as provided
in the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

He highly appreciated the Asia Foundation's efforts and assistance
granted over the years, and especially for sending Cambodia's senior
government officials to study the elections in Bangladesh as it is an
important experience for holding the elections in Cambodia in 1997 and
1998.

Lucian Pye said that Asia Foundation would continue to assist the Royal
Government in various aspects, particularly in human rights development
and capacity building.

Ranariddh warns against poll violence

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

PHNOM PENH: First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh on Tuesday said
his party would win the next general elections in 1998 but warned against
intimidation and violence ahead of the polls.

Analysts believed the words of the head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party
were aimed at the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen, a battlefield foe turned coalition government partner.

The two parties formed a fragile alliance after FUNCINPEC narrowly edged
out the incumbent CPP in a landmark 1993 election organised by the United
Nations.

Their partnership turned sour in March when the royalists demanded a
greater share of power.

"FUNCINPEC won the 1993 election and I am pretty sure that in 1998
FUNCINPEC is going to win the election again. It will not fail, "the
Prince said at his party headquarters.

"We must take the bitter lessons of the 1993 election and apply them for
the 1998 election, "he said.

"I would like to say, as president of FUNCINPEC, that during the 1997
(local elections) and 1998 election, we will not allow anyone to suppress
FUNCINPEC as in 1993," he said.

He reiterated, at a seminar earlier this week to discuss the fifth
anniversary of the October 23,1991 Cambodian peace pact, that the next
elections should end the current system of two premiers and introduce a
single Prime Minister.

The coalition rift earlier this year saw Hun Sen at one stage warning he
would use force to prevent any attempt to break up the government after
Ranariddh had threatened to pull out.

The tension has abated in the past three months but the two leaders
continue to snipe at each other, normally in closed doors meetings whose
outcomes are often leaked. Analysts see the bickering as early
electioneering.

Cambodia: Marines prepare for Marlboro Cup

from CAMBODIA TODAY, October 25, 1996

by Iem Sakmay

PHNOM PENH: The Korng Neaveachor (Royal Navy) soccer team is practicing
hard to prepare themselves for the forthcoming Marlboro Cup football
tournament in December.

Coach Chinsive said that the team is now training at the Institute of
Technology soccer pitch as their original training ground at the Kien
Kleang military garrison was flooded.

"The trainees, numbering 18, are divided into two teams and being members
of the military, they have ample time to train six times a week.

"The players are aged between 19 and 30 and many of them have had
Marlboro Cup tournament exposure," the coach said. He added that the team
had competed in numerous tournaments throughout the country and finished
fourth in the Samdech Krom Preah Cup tournament.

"In the last Marlboro Cup, we finished sixth but this time, we are
confident of doing better and we may even win the championship with some
luck as we are training hard," Chinsive said.The Marine soccer team had
also competed with visiting soccer teams from the Malaysian Navy and
others and has emerged victorious.

"We have defeated the Malaysian naval team in March this year," said To
Socheat, the assistant coach.

He pointed out that with regular tournaments, the marines hope to have
several of their leading players playing for the national team.

"As we are from the military, fitness is not a main problem to us.

"We are perfecting our technical and tactical skills as fitness alone
will not enable us to emerge as winners," Socheat stressed.

He added that privately organised soccer tournaments would enable
Cambodians to develop their football talent as the prize money is
attractive.

 ANTI-DRUG COOPERATION THE MAIN CONCERN AT CARICOM SUMMIT MEETING

 When President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana was asked what progress the Caricom 
summit in Barbados had made towards regional inegration, his answer was 
succinct: nothing. His view was shared by many observers, who noted that the 
Caribbean leaders had gone into the four-day meeting on 4 July with high 
hopes of settling some long-standing issues, but emerged disappointed.

 The single market was, as ever, at the top of the agenda but, as always,  
little or nothing was achieved. Islands fear their domestic production will 
be damaged unless safeguards are built in to any accords, and the unanimity 
rule means that the 14-strong community as a whole can only go at the pace 
of the slowest member. Proposals to speed things up by revising the founding 
Treaty of Chaguaramas got nowhere.

 Some ground may even have been lost: Trinidad and Barbados engaged in a 
heated dispute on alleged protectionism by the latter, which had imposed 
controls on imports of milk, juices and pasta from Trinidad.

 One concrete achievement was the establishment of the Caribbean Investment 
Fund (CIF), which is designed to channel investments into the region, mainly 
as replacements for the dwindling economic aid from the developed countries. 
Total aid from the United States, for example, was only US Dollars 22m last 
year, compared with US Dollars 226m in 1985.

 An agreement to arrange a meeting with Latin American banana producers, in 
an attempt to forge a united position on the US challenge to the European 
Union banana market regime (see Page 7, inside) was also welcomed by 
delegates.

 Another plus point was an agreement on cooperation against drug-
trafficking, which was the US's main concern at the meeting. About 40% of 
the cocaine reaching US markets goes via the Caribbean, with Puerto Rico 
acting as the last staging-post for much of it.

 A number of bilateral accords are already in place, or being negotiated, 
which give the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) the right to patrol 
islands' territorial waters and airspace. 'I think we have to err on the 
side of limiting sovereignty to some extent, in order to facilitate a 
greater attempt to catch these people,' said Antigua and Barbuda's Prime 
Minister, Lester Bird.

 Basdeo Panday of Trinidad and Tobago agreed: 'If we are not prepared to 
sacrifice some of the eighteenth and nineteenth century concepts of 
sovereignty, then we will lose our sovereignty to the drug lords,' he said. 
But other countries, such as Guyana, Belize and Jamaica, are less willing to 
hand over control to Washington.

 CUBA: DIPLOMACY: HELMS-BURTON PUTS PRESSURE ON EU LINK: CLINTON HESITATES 
OVER PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER

 President Clinton was due as we went to press to announce whether he would 
be exercising the presidential waiver on parts of the Helms-Burton law (see 
RC-96-05 & 03) that would allow US nationals to sue in US courts foreigners 
'trafficking' in assets confiscated by the Cuban government since 1959. 
Pressure from trading partners (and US businesses) to tone down the 
provisions of the law had been mounting -with threats of retaliation- but 
Clinton was known to be reluctant to do anything that might alienate the 
Florida Cuba lobby in an election year.

 ING pulls out. The law, which is designed to discourage third countries 
from trading with and investing in Cuba, had already scored one important 
success. On 4 July the ING banking group, of the Netherlands, announced that 
it was pulling out of financing the Cuban sugar industry because of the 
Helms-Burton legislation.

 ING, which has been expanding its presence vigorously in Cuba in recent 
years, was one of the foreign banks whose financial support was vital to 
Cuba's efforts to recover from last year's disastrous sugar harvest (see RC-
96-01), by enabling it to import fertiliser, spare parts and other inputs.

 But the group has now said that it will not renew US Dollars 30m in loans 
to the Cuban state sugar marketing company, Cubazucar, because its 
subsidiaries in the US could be exposed to legal action there. The ING's 
decision must cast doubt on the financing of the 1996-97 sugar harvest, for 
which the target is over 5m tonnes.

 The Cuban government maintains that hardly any of the foreign companies 
active in Havana are at risk of prosecution in the US courts under what is 
formally known as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, and ING 
insists that it will continue all its other operations in Cuba.

 Recognising the possible impact of the Helms-Burton law, Vice-President 
Carlos Lage, who is in charge of the economy, said on 6 July that Cuba would 
have to rely more on a combination of greater efficiency and domestic 
savings for investments in future.

 EU doubts. Helms-Burton has also cast a further cloud over the European 
Union's economic cooperation with Cuba, which was already faltering because 
of the slow pace of democratic reforms (see RC-96-05).

 The Italian government, which occupied the presidency of the Union until 
the end of June, insists that the EU will defend its interests if Washington 
attempts to apply the law against the companies of member countries. But a 
seminar in Sitges on 10 July, organised by the Institute of European-Latin 
American Relations (Irela), concluded that the prospects of an economic 
accord with the island were becoming more remote.

 BOTH SIDES CLAIM  AIR INCIDENT VICTORY: HIJACK ENABLES HAVANA TO SEIZE BACK 
THE INITIATIVE

 The outcome of the international civil aviation organisation's inquiry into 
the downing of two light aircraft in February by the Cuban air force -an 
event that hastened the approval of the Helms-Burton law by the US Congress- 
had good and bad aspects for Cuba.

 On the one hand, the resolution issued on 27 June did not explicitly 
condemn Cuba, and did not confirm the US contention that the planes, 
operated by a Miami-based Cuban exile organisation, Hermanos al Rescate, had 
been shot down over international waters. On the other, it did condemn the 
use of force against unarmed civilian aircraft.

 Cuba's public position was that the resolution was a vindication of its 
arguments and a setback for Washington. The Castro government insisted that 
the inquiry report only accepted the US version of events and distorted what 
had really happened, and the resolution had tacitly recognised this.

 Cuba maintained that the aircraft had violated its airspace several times 
and had been shot down after repeated warnings. It further noted that the 
resolution urged states to control flights that violated other countries' 
airspace, and was preparing to challenge the US at the United Nations 
Security Council as we went to press. The meeting was expected to begin on 
or around 22 July.

 Guantanamo hijack. Any triumphalism in Washington over the report proved to 
be short-lived. At the end of June a Cuban gunman hijacked a domestic 
airliner to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay and claimed political 
asylum. This immediately put the Clinton administration in an uncomfortable 
dilemma: to grant asylum to a hijacker would be in contravention both of 
international accords against air piracy and of bilateral agreements between 
the US and Cuba. It would also give Cuba the opportunity to go back on the 
diplomatic offensive.

 However, to hand the hijacker over to the Cuban authorities, or take him to 
court, as Havana was demanding, would outrage the same exile groups that 
Clinton has been so anxious to keep onside.

 To make matters even more complicated, the hijacker identified himself as a 
senior officer in the Cuban security forces: Lieutenant-Colonel Jose 
Fernandez Pupo. The Cubans maintained that he had been an officer in the 
interior ministry forces, but had been dismissed earlier this year on 
suspicion of embezzlement.

 Under the May 1995 migration agreements between Washington and Havana, 
which put an end to the outflow of 'raft people' from the island, all would-
be migrants attempting to enter US territory (including Guantanamo) without 
a visa should be returned to the island.

PILOT BAN REDUCED

The indefinite suspension of the pilot's licence of Hermanos al Rescate 
president Jose Basulto by the Federal Aviation Administration was reduced to 
150 days by a US federal judge on 5 July. The court ruled that Basulto had 
only violated Cuban airspace 'slightly and unwittingly' in July last year. 
His was the only one of three planes to return to Miami on 24 February this 
year.

LIST OF 'SUSPECTS'

A Miami law firm, Nicolas Gutierrez, has notified the State Department of a 
supplementary list of foreign companies suspected of trafficking in 
confiscated property. They include Pemex (Mexico), the Sol-Melia hotels 
group (Spain), Sandoz pharmaceutical laboratories (Switzerland), Pernod-
Ricard distilleries (France), BM Industries, an Israeli citrus fruits 
producer, and Monte Carlo Real Estate Investments of Monaco.

ECONOMIC GROWTH 'TO CONTINUE'

Carlos Lage said in mid-June that, despite Helms-Burton, he expected first-
half figures to show the economy maintaining the 7% growth rate recorded in 
the first quarter.

 He put the 1995-96 sugar harvest at 4.45m tonnes, and said nickel 
production for the year would probably reach a record 50,000 tonnes, 40% 
more than in 1995. In addition, tourism had grown by 40%, tobacco production 
by 25% and agricultural output in general by 22%.

 The official target for GDP growth this year is 5%, compared with 2.5% in 
1995 and 0.7% in 1994. Between 1990 and 1993 the economy contracted by 34.3% 
in relation to 1989 levels. Economy and planning minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez said on 7 July that economic recovery was 'irreversible.'

 Canadian entrepreneur Wally Berukoff announced at the beginning of July 
that he was entering a joint venture to build 11 tourist hotels with the 
Cuban state hotels company.

NO MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM

Apparently confirming the impression that there has been a political clamp-
down in the island since the Helms-Burton law was passed in March, Communist 
Party first secretary Esteban Lazo said at the end of June that the 
introduction of a multi-party political system would 'fragment' the unity of 
the Cuban people. In present circumstances, he said, that would be 
'suicidal' and 'unforgivable.' He said the overwhelming majority of Cubans 
had no wish to see any more parties.

 HAITI: HUMAN RIGHTS: OUTRAGE OVER RELEASE OF CONSTANT: WASHINGTON RELUCTANT 
TO HAND OVER FRAPH LEADER

 The government of President Rene Preval has demanded the extradition from 
the US of Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant, 39, leader of the right-wing 
paramilitary organisation Fraph, who was released from a Maryland detention 
centre in mid-June. Washington is reluctant to hand Constant over to the 
authorities because of what a State Department spokesman described as the 
weakness of the Haitian judicial system.

 US ambassador William Swing has, however, assured the Haitian government 
that Washington has no wish to keep Constant, who describes himself as a CIA 
informer, a moment longer than necessary. He is wanted in Haiti in 
connection with hundreds of atrocities committed by Fraph members in the 
wake of the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 
September 1991.

 Constant was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after 
entering the US illegally in 1995. His release was described by Haitian 
human rights activists in the US as 'an unforgivable insult to the dignity 
and honour of the Haitian people.'

 ST KITTS & NEVIS: POLITICS: NEVIS SEEKS TO LEAVE FEDERATION: SMALLER ISLAND 
COMPLAINS OF 'DOMINATION' BY NEIGHBOUR

 The Premier of Nevis, Vance Amory, announced on 24 June that the island was 
taking steps to secede from the federation with St Kitts, its larger 
neighbour in the Leeward Islands. Amory said he had instructed lawyers to 
prepare a separation bill, under section 113 of the constitution.

 Long-standing resentment. Amory claimed there was no alternative to 
separation. Nevis has long complained of being dominated by St Kitts, and 
Amory took particular exception to the federal government opening an office 
in the Nevis capital, Charlestown. He described the move as unconstitutional 
and an affront to the rights of Nevisians.

 To make matters worse, the government of Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, 
elected last year (see RC-95-06), has also introduced legislation requiring 
all outside investments in Nevis to be channelled through St Kitts.

 The federal government insists that the opening of an office in Charlestown 
is merely intended to improve communications between the two islands, and 
will not undermine Amory's position.

 The constitutional procedure for dissolving the federation apparently 
includes a referendum, which means the process will be protracted. A two-
thirds majority in favour of secession is required.

 Nevis has a population of about 10,000, an area of 93sq km (half that of St 
Kitts) and considerable autonomy within the federation. It has three seats 
in the 11-seat federation parliament, as well as an assembly of its own.

 Both islands' economies are based on sugar cane, and increasingly on 
tourism. Trans-shipment of drugs is a growing problem, bringing with it 
violence and a succession of scandals in recent times (see RC-96-05).

 FOCUS: CARIBBEAN TOURISM AFTER THE HURRICANES: DISASTERS EXACERBATED TRENDS 
ALREADY UNDER WAY

 With the new hurricane season already upon us, there is a good deal of 
understandable apprehension in the Caribbean countries whose tourist 
industries were hard hit by last year's high winds.

 With more statistics now available, it is now possible to assess the impact 
-at least in terms of visitor arrivals, if not yet always in terms of the 
associated economic impact.

 The countries which suffered most were Anguilla, with total arrivals down 
14.9%; Antigua & Barbuda (-8.9%), the Bahamas (-8%) and St Kitts-Nevis (-
3.2%).

 If the focus is shifted towards the most lucrative portion of that trade, 
the stop-over arrivals, the picture changes somewhat. The hardest hit was 
Antigua & Barbuda (-18.5%), followed by Anguilla (-16.5%), St Kitts-Nevis (-
10.4%), Montserrat (-3.5%) -and Grenada, where stop-over arrivals declined 
by 2.5%, while total arrivals increased by 25.2%.

 The Bahamas appears as an anomaly: though total arrivals fell, the 
lucrative stop-over arrivals increased by 4.3%.

 The economic impact of these developments varied quite considerably, as the 
tourist industry does not have the same weight in the various economies. It 
was greatest in Anguilla and Antigua & Barbuda, where tourism earnings in 
1994 accounted for 83.4% and 79.6% of GDP, respectively.

 In the Bahamas it accounted for just over 40%, in St Kitts and Montserrat 
for 36-38%, and in Grenada for just under 22%.

 Antigua & Barbuda, which had seen its GDP grow by 5.5% in 1994, registered 
a 3.8% contraction in 1995. The picture for Anguilla is less clear: in 1994 
the economy grew by 8.1%, but all that the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) 
records for last year in its recently published annual report is, 
'Preliminary indications are that GDP contracted in Anguilla in 1995.'

 At least a slowdown, perhaps even a contraction, took place in Montserrat, 
which had grown by only 0.8% in 1994. In St Kitts & Nevis the effect ws a 
slowdown in the rate of growth, from 3.2% in 1994 to 2% in 1995.

 On the other hand, in both the Bahamas and Grenada there were slight 
accelerations of the growth rate; from 0.6% to 1.5% in the former, 2% to 
2.3% in the latter.

 It is well worth noting that the hurricanes cannot be blamed for 
everything; in fact, as the CDB underlines, they seem to have exacerbated 
trends which were already visible before 1995. The most important one of 
these is 'the increasing importance of the cruise segment of the industry', 
to the detriment of the higher-spending stop-over segment.

 The one stop-over bracket that has been showing positive signs is that of 
the all-inclusive resorts (on the model of Club Med), though their impact 
has been chiefly to erode the appeal of the traditional hotel trade.

 The CDB notes in its annual report that a number of Caribbean countries 
have tried to act upon this main trend by investing heavily in duty-free 
facilities for visitors, and that 'these operations appear to have enjoyed a 
successful year, despite competition from on-board facilities on cruise 
liners.'

 Coping successfully with the trends within the tourist industry has become 
critical because of a broader macro-economic trend noted by the CDB: the 
continuation in 1995 of 'the shift away from traditional merchandise 
production to services and tourism, particularly in the smaller BMCs 
[borrowing member countries].'

 The economic performance update on the following page incorporates the 
latest data from the CDB and other sources: please note that in many cases 
the figures for 1994 have been revised.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: ELECTIONS: BALAGUER-BOSCH ALLIANCE TRIUMPHS: BUT 
FERNANDEZ PROMISESNATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT

 The 'stop Pena Gomez' strategy devised by President Joaquin Balaguer and 
his old enemy Juan Bosch, outlined in our last issue, was completely 
successful. Leonel Fernandez, Bosch's youthful (42) protege, duly defeated 
Pena Gomez in the run-off on 30 June.

 Fernandez received just over 51% of the votes against Pena Gomez' 48.75%. 
In the first round on 16 May, Pena Gomez had won 46% to Fernandez' 39%. It 
was Balaguer's support that made the difference.

 Fernandez' Partido de la Liberacion Dominicana (PLD) has only one seat in 
the senate and 12 in the 120-seat lower chamber (see box), which means that 
the new President will be forced to rely on the backing of Balaguer's 
Partido Reformista Social Cristiano (PRSC) to get his legislative programme 
through -at least until the next congressional elections in 1998.

 Fernandez has talked of wanting a 'government of national unity,' which 
suggests that he does not relish the prospect of being completely beholden 
to the octogenarian former President -whose support, he said, was given 
'without conditions'.

 Whether and how Pena Gomez will agree to take part in the new 
administration remains to be seen. His prompt recognition of his opponent's 
victory, and pledge to constitute a loyal opposition, were at least a good 
start. But it is certain that Balaguer will retain a strong influence over 
whatever government takes shape.

 One area where the incoming President's resolve will be tested is that of 
privatisation. He, like Pena Gomez, pledged during the campaign to speed up 
a process that was begun only reluctantly by Balaguer, who found state-owned 
enterprises useful instruments of patronage, not to mention revenue.

 But foreign capital will have to be pumped into the electric power utility 
if the country's chronic energy crisis is ever to be resolved. The Balaguer-
controlled congress has been sitting on the enabling legislation for the 
past two years. And the sugar marketing monopoly is such a disaster that 
there is no alternative to divestment.

 Fernandez has also promised to tackle the corruption that was endemic under 
Balaguer, and to remove the state budget from the President's personal 
control.

 If Pena Gomez is to have some part in the new government, he will insist on 
electoral reforms, to ensure that opposition candidates have equal access to 
the media in future, and do not have to fight against the state apparatus as 
well as the government's candidate.

PROFILE: LEONEL FERNANDEZ

Leonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna is a 42-year-old lawyer, who spent six years 
of his childhood in New York. He joined the PLD when it was founded in 1973 
by Juan Bosch. He worked his way steadily and silently up the party 
hierarchy, and was Bosch's running-mate in the 1994 presidential elections. 
A year later he was selected as presidential candidate with 93% support 
within the PLD.

 As a relatively young man in a gerontocracy, Fernandez is particularly 
popular with Dominican youth and -they say- with women (he is divorced).

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO: POLITICS: PNM LOSES GROUND IN LOCAL ELECTIONS: BUT 
RULING COALITION FAILS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION

 The opposition People's National Movement (PNM) won a narrow victory in the 
local and regional elections on 24 June, but lost some ground overall. The 
party maintained its dominant position in the urban areas, and retained 
control of Port of Spain city council. It subsequently chose John Rahael, 
who owns a chain of clothes shops, to succeed Ethelbert Paul as mayor on 4 
July.

 UNC wins two more councils. Despite winning 63 of the 124 seats at stake in 
five municipal districts and nine regional councils, the PNM ended up in 
control of only seven of the country's 14 councils, compared with 10 after 
the 1992 elections. The United National Congress (UNC), which is stronger in 
rural areas, now controls six, compared with four last time out. In the 
previous regional elections, the PNM had won 75 seats to the UNC's 40.

 The results did not, however, represent the consolidation of the ruling 
party's position that Prime Minister Basdeo Panday had been hoping for. The 
UNC's fractious partner in government, A. N. R. Robinson's National Alliance 
for Reconstruction (NAR), which only put up 36 candidates, won no seats at 
all.

 Attorney-general Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj commented that the UNC had done as 
well as could be expected, given the PNM's strong regional organisation.

 PNM leader Patrick Manning, under fire after losing last November's general 
election, insisted that his position was not in danger following the latest 
setbacks.

 REGION: BANANAS: PRODUCERS HOPE FOR ACCORD WITH LATINS: CLINTON REFUSES TO 
WITHDRAW WTO COMPLAINT OVER EU REGIME

 The Caribbean producers' lobbying of Washington, in an attempt to persuade 
the US to withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about 
the European Union's banana market regime (see RC-96-03), is growing 
increasingly desperate and forlorn. Some sort of agreement with Latin 
American growers may be their last resort.

 Clinton sympathetic, but ... When Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, 
speaking for all the regional producers, appealed to President Bill Clinton 
to give the small island producers a break, he received a dusty answer. 
Despite Clinton's promise that the US does not seek to damage the economies 
and societies of the Caribbean, it seems unlikely that it will back off from 
the WTO action. His letter spoke of 'discriminatory and unnecessarily 
restrictive regulations' in the EU regime.

 The recent Caricom summit approved plans to convene a meeting with Latin 
American producers, in Belize in October. The running is being made in 
Central America by former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. Guatemala, 
Honduras and Mexico joined Ecuador (the world's biggest banana producer) in 
supporting the US complaint to the WTO.

 But bringing the two camps together will not be easy. The low-cost Latin 
American producers feel that the EU regime, under the Lome Agreement, 
unfairly discriminates against them as much as it puts US marketing 
companies, such as Chiquita Brands, at a disadvantage.

 Lome rules. Under the Lome Agreement (Lome IV), the EU allows 857,000 
tonnes a year of Caribbean bananas into its market, while imposing both 
quotas and duties on Latin American ('dollar') bananas. A framework 
agreement with four of the Latin American producers -Costa Rica, Colombia, 
Nicaragua and Venezuela- grants them preferential quotas.

 Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, at least, is optimistic. He says 
the October meeting 'will allow the two major players in this issue a 
greater understanding of the problems we face and, perhaps, show us a way 
forward where we could confront this issue ... from a common understanding 
rather than the current situation, in which some Central and Latin American 
producing countries are on one side ... and some others and ourselves are on 
the other.'

 The Caribbean producers fear that the EU is wilting under US and Latin 
American pressure. For the last quarter of 1996, the EU has increased the 
'dollar' bananas quota from 2.2m tonnes to 2.55m. This, they say, will both 
contribute to driving prices down further and take market share away from 
struggling Caribbean producers.

 Quality problems. The Windward Islands, in particular, have been struggling 
with quality-control problems, and recently had to buy fruit from Latin 
American producers to enable them to fulfil their EU obligations. The 
Windward Islands Banana Development and Exporting Company (Wibdeco) admitted 
that it was receiving a premium price from British supermarkets for only 60% 
of its sales.

 St Lucia's Prime Minister, Vaughn Lewis, who has good contacts in the US, 
has now taken on much of the Windwards' lobbying efforts there. He has also 
been leading discussions with EU representatives on European aid for 
'rehabilitation' of the banana industry.

 At the same time, Grenada's Prime Minister, Keith Mitchell, visited Japan 
in mid-July in an attempt to persuade Tokyo to use its influence on the 
Caribbean's behalf at the WTO. Grenada, St Vincent and St Lucia back Japan's 
demands for a relaxation of international controls on whaling.

 The burden of this effort, as ever, is to persuade the outside world that 
the islands depend on bananas for agricultural, economic and social 
stability -with the threat of increasing problems with drug-trafficking and 
illegal migrations if that stability is destroyed. Banana exports to Europe 
account for 50% of the Windwards' foreign exchange earnings.

 Jagan warning. Guyana's Cheddi Jagan put it in a nutshell at the Caricom 
meeting when he warned that marijuana was an obvious alternative to bananas 
for farmers throughout the region.

 While Clinton's reply to Patterson offered to 'meet informally with 
Caribbean countries to search for mutually acceptable alternatives to the 
current EU system,' such vague expressions of good will cut little ice in 
the Caribbean: the Jamaica Gleaner called it 'double speak'.

 'We are comfortable with the EU regime, and if they have an alternative ... 
which will not damage us, then they must come forward with that ... but they 
are not doing that,' said Dominica Prime Minister Edison James.

GUYANA MILITARY STAND-OFF

The Jagan government found itself in an unexpected confrontation with the 
military in June, when the dismissed second-in-command of the army (GDF) 
threatened 'serious instability' unless he was reinstated. The People's 
Progressive Party (PPP) government held firm.

 Colonel Goodwin McPherson was suspended after allegations of 
misappropriation of funds in 1995, while he was temporarily in command of 
the GDF. The move led to mutterings in the ranks about 'political 
opportunism'. Some officers say McPherson is being victimised because he is 
regarded as a supporter of the opposition People's National Congress (PNC), 
which ruled the country for 28 years.

 The PPP regarded the predominantly black GDF as an arm of the PNC during 
the long Forbes Burnham regime, but has praised its 'professionalism' since 
Jagan's election victory in 1992 -when the military voted overwhelmingly for 
the PNC.

 POSTSCRIPT

 BAHAMAS/ Cubans repatriated. Thirty-eight Cuban refugees were sent home in 
June, under a bilateral agreement signed in January on the repatriation of 
illegal immigrants. A total of 80 people have now been deported since then. 
Immigration minister C.A. Smith says the process will continue until all the 
200 Cubans still in the Bahamas have been returned home.

 BARBADOS/ Jobless fall. Unemployment in the last quarter of 1995 registered 
16.4%, down from 21.7% in the first quarter of the year, according to the 
latest figures from the central bank. 

Labour movement. The government has removed work permit requirements for 
skilled workers from other Caricom member states. The amendment, which 
fulfils a 1989 agreement by Caricom leaders to move towards the free 
movement of labour throughout the region, follows similar legislation 
adopted in Trinidad and Tobago. 

 BERMUDA/ Burger blockade. The government's controversial decision to allow 
McDonald's restaurants to open a branch on the island has been overturned by 
a censure motion passed by the opposition and a group of five government 
rebels, including former tourism minister Jim Woolridge. 

 CUBA/ Island online. The government has approved public access to the 
internet and other information facilities. Businesses and institutions 
involved in 'national development' will have priority, and users will have 
to register with the science and technology ministry, reports the official 
newspaper Granma.

Drug seizures. So far this year the authorities have made 24 drug-busts, 
seizing one and a half tonnes of cocaine and a tonne of marihuana, the 
national antidrugs commission announces. Though it says it is concerned 
about the increased use of the island by smugglers, it insists that drug 
consumption is not a problem in Cuba.

Infant mortality falls. Infant deaths in the first six months of the year 
fell to 8.2 per 1000 births, from 9.4 in the same period of 1995, according 
to the public health ministry. The World Health Organisation places Cuba 
among the 25 countries with the lowest rates.

Student labour. Nearly one million students belonging to the 'Fuerzas De 
Accion Pioneriles' and the 'Brigadas Estudiantiles de Trabajo' youth groups, 
as well as 108,000 teachers, were mobilised on 8 July for a two-week work 
stint on farms and sugar plantations. According to the organisers 10,000 
more students volunteered to help this year than in 1995. 

 GUYANA/ Gold investment. Government officials say the Canadian mining giant 
Placer Dome is once again interested in gold mining in Guyana, following a 
meeting between company director Robert Franklin and President Cheddi Jagan 
during the latter's recent 12-day visit to Canada. Six years ago the company 
halted its operations in the country saying the Omai mine was insufficiently 
profitable. 

 HAITI/ EU aid boost. Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European Development 
Commissioner, has promised a 'clear increase' in financial aid for the 
island over the next five years. He told visiting President Rene Preval that 
the EU is determined to strengthen democracy and economic development in the 
Caribbean nation. Haiti has received US Dollars 180m in aid from the EU 
since 1989.

Mixed results. GDP grew by 4% during 1995, following the lifting of the 
international trade embargo against the former military regime, though 
unemployment was 50% and the budget deficit increased considerably, Eclac 
reports. It says most sectors registered growth, with the exception of 
agriculture, which shrank by 8.5%, partly due to hurricane damage.

 ST. LUCIA/ Opposition alliance. Julian Hunte, the former leader of the St. 
Lucia Labour party, will form an alliance against the present government at 
the upcoming general elections with his one time rival George Odlum, leader 
of the National Front. Hunte, who recently announced his resignation from 
politics, said he had a change of heart, and would be standing for the Gros 
Islet seat.

 SURINAME/ Parties unite. Three of the main political parties, the New 
Front, Democratic Alternative 91 and Pendawalina, have begun talks on 
forming a coalition government, following inconclusive results in May's 
general elections. The three parties won 32 of the 51 seats in the national 
assembly.

 TRINIDAD & TOBAGO/ Trade figures. A trade surplus of US Dollars 133.5m was 
recorded in the first quarter, a 61% fall on the US Dollars 336m surplus 
registered in the same period of the previous year, according to the 
statistics office. The United States is still the major recipient of the 
islands' exports, receiving 43.6% of the total, though exports to Caricom 
countries have risen to 27.8%.

 REGION/ Hurricane strikes. Hurricane Bertha, the first of the Atlantic 
season, brought winds of up to 160km/h to the region.  Worst hit so far has 
been Puerto Rico and the British and US Virgin islands, with flooding, 
downed power lines and damage to property. In Puerto Rico the hurricane left 
three dead, including one man who drowned while surfing. The island was 
saved from further damage by a high pressure front which forced the 
hurricane northwards. A Venezuelan ship got into difficulties off the coast 
of St. Thomas in the US Virgin islands, and 20 of the 42 crew members went 
missing, feared drowned.

 LACAYO FAILS IN BID TO OVERTURN BAN ON HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF 
Nicaragua

 The decision by the Consejo Supremo Electoral (CSE) to rule out the 
presidential candidacies of Antonio Lacayo, Alvaro Robelo and Eden Pastora 
was hailed by Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo on 7 July as a sign that 'the 
law is beginning to be obeyed in Nicaragua.' After much vacillation, and 
with violence continuing in many parts of the country, the stage at last 
appears to be set for a reasonably orderly electoral process in October.

 The elimination of Lacayo from the contest was no more than an application 
of the constitutional ban on relatives of the President standing for the 
office -he is President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law. But he had hoped 
until the last moment to mount a successful legal challenge to the ruling. 
Lacayo, who is 48, will now have to wait until the year 2001 before he can 
run again for President.

 His failure, whatever the merits or otherwise of the constitutional 
provision, introduced last year, is a triumph for the rule of law. The other 
two hopefuls were ruled out on the grounds that they had adopted foreign 
citizenship: Robelo, candidate of the right-wing Alianza Nicaraguense, is 
regarded as an Italian (which he denies) and the former guerrilla leader 
Pastora ('Comandante Zero') is Costa Rican.

 Obando y Bravo was encouraged by the fact that the candidates appeared to 
have accepted the CSE decision 'with resignation', a sign of growing 
political maturity.

 Such signs were long overdue, after months of squabbling, delays and 
factional disputes (see RC-96-04). But the armed groups roaming the central 
and northern regions have not demonstrated comparable progress.

 On the contrary, 33 electoral officials were kidnapped and held by one such 
group in mid-June. Their release, after the intercession of both the church 
and the Organisation of American States (OAS), was a reminder that 
Nicaragua's future political stability still rests heavily on the 
intervention of benevolent outside forces.

 The army is doing its best to hold the ring, but has its hands full. At the 
end of June the high command reported that it had been involved in 63 
operations against armed bands since the beginning of the year, inflicting 
more than 80 casualties and detaining a further 200.

 The gangs, many of which operate close to the Honduran frontier, are 
pressing for the army to be withdrawn from their areas of influence, and 
have prevented the electoral authorities from registering voters and 
distributing identity documents.

 The authorities estimate that there are 69 armed bands in the centre and 
north, with a total strength of about 460. Many are former combatants, both 
Sandinistas and Contras, who now make a living from robbery and kidnappings.

 The resignation shown by Lacayo's Proyecto Nacional (Pronal) organisation 
has extended to holding a hastily-arranged convention on 7 July to select a 
replacement for Lacayo as presidential candidate. Banker and construction 
company chief Benjamin Lanzas was the only serious contender. The party is 
not expected to get much more than 2% of the votes on 20 October.

 A total of 19 presidential candidacies have been approved by the CSE. The 
leading contenders are Arnoldo Aleman, former mayor of Manuagua, standing 
for the Liberals, and former President Daniel Ortega, for the Frente 
Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional (FSLN). Both emerged unscathed from 
attempts to have their candidacies ruled out by the CSE.

 PANAMA: DRUGS & POLITICS: PRESIDENT OBLIGED TO EAT HIS WORDS: 'DIRTY' MONEY 
DID FIND ITS WAY INTO 1994 ELECTION CAMPAIGN

 Drug-trafficking and money-laundering, which optimists thought had been 
brought under control since the removal of General Manuel Noriega in 1989, 
have elbowed their way back onto the centre-stage of Panamanian politics. 
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, initially defiant, has been forced to 
make an embarrassing climb-down.

 Campaign contribution. The episode began with a resounding success for the 
Panamanian anti-drugs police when, in cooperation with forces from several 
other countries, they uncovered a drug shipping and money-laundering 
operation in the heart of Panama City. It later transpired that the 
suspected boss of these rackets, Jose Castrillon Henao, a Colombian, had 
contributed to the President's 1994 election campaign.

 When the New York Times, Miami Herald and the British weekly The Economist 
suggested as much, Perez threatened to sue the last-named, but had to back 
off when it turned out that the publication's charges were, if anything, 
understated.

 One positive, if indirect, outcome may be a tightening-up of Panama's 
banking and company registration laws. Castrillon Henao, who had apparently 
been running maritime shipping operations for Valle del Cauca cocaine 
interests out of Panama for at least eight years, had set up dozens of 
phoney bank accounts in Panama's international financial centre, and used 
the funds to accumulate an impressive portfolio of property and other 
interests in Panama, controlled through paper companies.

 The alarm about what might be going on in the banking centre, where 120 
financial institutions have set up shop in the past 25 years under a very 
relaxed regime, had already been sounded in January. The Banco 
Agroindustrial y Comercial (Banaico), a small institution with links to the 
ruling Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD), was taken into 
administration by the national banking commission after a liquidity crisis, 
and its managers were subsequently charged with fraud.

 Economy minister Guillermo Chapman explained that the current banking 
legislation, dating back to 1971, gives the government very limited powers 
of regulation and supervision. He said changes were needed to make sure 
there was no repetition of the Banaico scandal. There are currently no 
controls at all on banks' credit policies, and very undemanding liquidity 
and reserve requirements.

 Perez Balladares has insisted that the new legislation must include strong 
anti-money laundering measures. He is no doubt mindful of the remarks by the 
State Department's anti-drugs chief, Robert Gelbard, who said in April that 
'billions of dollars' were being laundered through the Panamanian financial 
centre, and the country ran the risk of falling into the clutches of the 
drug cartels once US forces completed their pull-out at the turn of the 
century (see RC-96-04).

 Castrillon's empire. Investigations into Castrillon Henao's activities in 
Panama revealed that he controlled more than 50 limited companies, and had 
opened dozens of accounts in at least nine banks, Banaico among them, under 
a variety of assumed names. One of these companies, the tuna-fishing 
enterprise Fuji Investments, had paid two cheques totalling US Dollars 
51,000 into Perez Balladares' 1994 campaign funds. The payment was made 
through Felix Estripeaut, a businessman friend of Vice-President Felipe 
Virzi, who was subsequently appointed ambassador to Costa Rica.

 Perez Balladares was forced to concede as much in a TV broadcast on 21 
June, two weeks after the allegations had appeared in the foreign press. He 
insisted he had known nothing of Castrillon Henao's narcotics connection, 
and vowed to get to the bottom of the matter at all costs. Attorney-general 
Jose Antonio Sosa is now carrying out an inquiry, beginning with depositions 
from Estripeaut and Virzi.

 Comparison with Colombia. By insisting that he had nothing to hide, Perez 
Balladares hoped to avoid a narcoescandalo of the sort that has been 
obsessing Colombia for the past year, nearly bringing down President Ernesto 
Samper in the process. The President has also made clear that he wants to 
see Castrillon extradited to the US.

 Another possible outcome of this episode is a reform of the financing of 
election campaigns. The PRD has been pressing for legislation to permit 
examination of party accounts, to head off opposition accusations that it 
has accepted 'dirty' money. As with the banking laws, current legislation on 
campaign funding is extremely lax.

 At least one other party, the opposition Partido Renovacion Civilista 
(PRC), has admitted receiving a donation from a Castrillon Henao front 
company.

COLOMBIANS HELD

Two further Colombian drug suspects, Jaime Revello and Vilma Escobar, were 
arrested in Panama on 4 July, after a six-month police operation. They were 
described as 'high-level South American mafia' figures. Escobar is the wife 
of Colombian drug boss Julian Garcia.

COSTA RICA WARNING

The US ambassador in San Jose, Peter de Vos, said on 5 July that Costa Rica 
was an 'important bridge' in the transport of drugs to the US from South 
America. He said the port of Limon was used for shipments, while light 
aircraft and road transport were also used.

 He added that he was 'very satisfied' with the cooperation of the Costa 
Rican government against such activities, but noted that much remained to be 
done.

TREATY ROW IN HONDURAS

An anti-drug and money-laundering treaty under negotiation with the US has 
provoked objections from government, opposition and military figures that 
some of the US demands would damage Honduran sovereignty. US personnel would 
be permitted to operate freely in Honduran territory and DEA agents would 
enjoy diplomatic immunity under the agreement.

 Honduran police had confiscated more than 3 tonnes of cocaine by mid-June; 
some 90% of the cocaine heading for the US market is believed to pass 
through Honduras.

 COSTA RICA: POLITICS: FIGUERES RESHUFFLES HIS CABINET PACK: PRIVATE SECTOR 
APPROVES BUT PUBLIC LESS IMPRESSED

 The sudden cabinet reshuffle at the beginning of July by President Jose 
Maria Figueres was variously described as 'profound' by the President, as 
'window-dressing' by the opposition and as something in between by 
respondents to opinion polls. The new-look cabinet contained only three 
fresh faces.

 More liberalisation. Figueres explained in a radio and television broadcast 
on 1 July that he had asked for the collective resignation of his government 
to enable him to deepen the processes of economic and trade liberalisation 
already initiated, and thereby to hasten the insertion of Costa Rica into 
the new, 'globalised' world order. His aim, he said, was to achieve these 
aims with the minimum 'social' impact and without harming the environment.

 He promised to concentrate, during the remaining 22 months of his four-year 
term, on four issues:

 Modernisation of the telecommunications system;

 Improvements to the road network;

 Reinforcement of health and education programmes; and

 Progress towards a national pensions system. 

 The President's plea for a national consensus on these issues came at a 
time when his own party was riven by dissent and congress was deadlocked. 
Members of the ruling Partido Liberacion Nacional (PLN) had brought 
legislative work to a halt in mid-June in a dispute over the election of a 
new comptroller-general and his deputy.

 Figueres and PLN deputies were outraged when their colleague Walter Coto, 
the chairman of congress, allied with the opposition Partido Unidad Social 
Cristiana (PUSC) to ensure the election of Luis Fernando Vargas and Jorge 
Corrales, the latter from the PUSC.

 The President had backed his close friend Rodolfo Silva for the top job, 
but his appointment was blocked by the opposition, while Corrales was 
unacceptable to the PLN, who blamed him for failing to head off the collapse 
of the Banco Anglo-Costarricense in 1994.

 Unpopular President. The opposition pointed out that Figueres' move smacked 
of desperation, at a time when, partly as a result of all this wrangling, 
his popularity had slumped to an all-time low (see RC-96-05). More than 50% 
of respondents to opinion polls in June described his performance as bad or 
very bad, and more again thought there was no prospect of an improvement.

 At least Figueres succeeded in winning the approval of the private sector 
for his bold move, with the Union Costarricense de Camaras y Asociaciones de 
la Empresa Privada (Uccaep) saying that economic reactivation would be 
impossible as long as rumour and uncertainty gripped the country.

 Business approval increased when Figueres appointed the former president of 
the Camara de Industrias, Jose Leon Desanti, as economy minister on 4 July -
the last appointment to be announced. The President said he hoped the 
appointment would symbolise an alliance with the private sector to improve 
output and competitiveness.

 Desanti had been an outspoken critic of the government's lack of a coherent 
industrial policy, singling out tax increases and poor infrastructure for 
particular attention.

 The replacement of only three ministers was taken by the opposition to mean 
that new initiatives would be strictly limited, and public opinion seemed to 
be unimpressed: 80.9% told the Demoscopia polling firm that the changes were 
superficial.

 The disappointment extended to the ruling PLN: Walter Coto complained there 
had been no change of attitude or style in the government team. Lorena 
Vazquez, general secretary of the PUSC, said Figueres was guilty of a 
political swindle.

 They noted that Figueres had kept faith with his inner circle of friends 
and advisers: security minister Juan Diego Castro, censured last year by 
congress, had been moved to justice, while his replacement at security was 
former transport minister Bernardo Arce -a graduate, like Figueres, of West 
Point.

 Marcos Vargas, Figueres' campaign treasurer, was transferred from the 
economy ministry to the presidency, and another crony, Ricardo Garron, was 
given the agriculture portfolio. Garron used to manage the Figueres family 
estates.

 The most striking new appointment (see box) was that of Rodolfo Silva as 
transport minister, as a consolation for failing to get the comptroller-
general's job.

 POSTSCRIPT

 COSTA RICA/ Industrial decline. Costa Rica's manufacturing industry, after 
growing at 40% a year in the 1980s, is slowly being replaced by high-tech 
industries, which benefit from the country's skilled workforce and proximity 
to the US market. The textile industry, accounting for 70% of manufactures, 
has particularly suffered, being undercut in the US by duty-free Mexican 
textiles since Nafta came into force. The tourism sector is also in 
recession, with 70% of hotels expected to end this year with losses.

IMF agreement. The new finance minister, Francisco de Paula, travelled to 
Washington in early July to explain to IMF officials his government's 
failure to keep the fiscal deficit to 0.5% of GDP as agreed. The more 
realistic prediction of 2% was put down to external factors, despite the 
comptroller-general's report which condemned the government for its lack of 
fiscal discipline, especially the issuing of bonds well beyond the limits 
authorised by congress.

EL SALVADOR/ Prison protest. President Armando Calderon Sol announced 
several measures to tackle the growing prisons crisis, including the 
construction of a new penal centre. Seventy inmates of Santa Ana prison have 
been taken to hospital after a month-long hunger strike in protest at 
overcrowding, long sentences and slow judicial procedures. Almost 74% of the 
country's prison population still await sentencing, and prisons are at over 
double their capacity.

Death threats. The extreme-right Furoda (Fuerza Nacionalista Roberto 
D'Aubuisson), named after the alleged creator of the 'death squads', has 
reiterated its death threats to 15 prominent public figures. President 
Calderon Sol has denied any involvement of his Arena party, and has promised 
a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, two of the four students arrested in 
mid-June after bomb attacks on property belonging to former president 
Alfredo Cristiani have been released.

GUATEMALA/ Death penalty. Two men convicted of the rape and murder of a 
four-year-old girl in 1993 are to be sent to the gallows after the 
constitutional court turned down their appeal. President Alvaro Arzu's 
subsequent refusal to pardon Roberto Giron and Pedro Castillo has provoked 
consternation in human rights groups at what will be the first judicial 
execution in Guatemala for 13 years.

 Amnesty International deeply regretted 'this step backwards' and criticised 
Guatemala's contravening of the 1978 American Convention on Human Rights, 
which stipulated that the death penalty could not be extended to cover 
additional crimes. Last year however, kidnapping was added to the offences 
punishable by death, and following a police operation in June in which two 
gangs were arrested and charged with kidnapping, the interior minister, 
Rodolfo Mendoza, called for the death penalty to be applied as a deterrent.

Military exemption ends. A new law, passed unanimously by congress, has 
effectively ended a century of privilege for the military, who are now to be 
tried in the civilian courts for all but strictly military crimes.

 This assault on military impunity was followed by President Arzu's decision 
to remove six colonels and a general from their posts, as part of his 
continuing 'cleansing' of the armed forces. The next step is to be a three-
phase disbanding of the civilian self-defence patrols (PACs), a key element 
in the army's counter-insurgency strategy.

HONDURAS/ Corruption. A former minister and a labour leader were the latest 
figures of the Callejas administration (1990-1994) to be accused of 
corruption in President Roberto Reina's 'moral revolution' campaign. Former 
President Rafael Callejas, also accused in spite of his parliamentary 
impunity, complained of Reina's 'purely political persecution'.

 Meanwhile, a further 13 military officers, charged with murdering two 
civilians in 1982, are on the run, joining the three fugitive officers 
accused of human rights violations who are suspected of hiding out in Chile, 
the US or Spain for the past eight months.

Coffee rise. Coffee exports will have increased 30% by the end of this 
harvest-year to reach 2.8m bags, generating some US Dollars 300m, and 
confirming coffee as the country's main export. Other sectors are suffering 
from the economic crisis provoked by a US Dollars 4.1bn debt burden and a 
growing trade deficit.

NICARAGUA/ Tax reform. President Violeta Chamorro has asked the national 
assembly to approve the delayed tax reform law as soon as possible, to free 
US Dollars 115m in new credits from multilateral organisations that await 
passage of the reform.

 But public finances were further squeezed when a special commission of the 
assembly rejected the presidential veto on allocating 6% of the budget to 
the universities.

Delincuents clampdown. The Managua police are to launch a campaign to 
contain the growth of armed youth gangs in the capital over the last year. 
There are estimated to be around 66 bands in the city, with members ranging 
between the ages of 11 and 15, armed with firearms and knives. A significant 
number of the gangs' members appear to have recently returned from the 
United States. Four teenegers were killed at the end of June as a result of 
gang infighting. 

PANAMA/ Tax climbdown. The government looks set to reverse a decision to 
impose an additional income tax on businesses in the Colon free zone, 
following several managerial-level strikes. The free zone, which generates 
revenues of US Dollars 11bn from imports and re-exports, has seen a 21.3% 
drop in commercial activity over the past five months, reflecting the 
nationwide recession.

 However, the Panama Canal authorities are expecting record toll receipts 
this year, after last year's figures showed a 6.7% increase over 1994. A 
total of 13,631 ships paid US Dollars 462m.

Arms for guerrillas. Police confiscated 11 AK-47 assault rifles and 28,000 
ammunition cartridges from a Panamanian man en route to the port of Colon, 
from where the authorities believe the weapons were to be shipped to the 
Colombian Farc guerrillas.

REGION/ Military peace. The top brass from across Central America agreed at 
a Unesco-organised forum held in San Salvador at the of June to work towards 
building a stronger 'culture of peace' and to assist government efforts to 
insert the subregion into the global economy.

ITRI OPENS BERLIN OFFICE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Bonn, Sept. 13 (CNA) The Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI),  Taiwan's  largest independent research institute, has set up
an  office  in  Berlin  in  a bid to expand exchanges and cooperation
between Taiwanese and German enterprises and academic bodies.

    ITRI  Vice  President  Chen  Ling-yuan made the announcement here
Thursday at a conference sponsored by ROC economic missions and trade
groups based in central Germany.

    In   line  with  the  government's  internationalization  policy,
domestic  research  institutes  also  need  to  establish strongholds
abroad  to boost international technology interflow with Taiwan, Chen
said,  pointing  out the ITRI has so far opened offices in the United
States, Japan and Russia.

    The initial target of the Berlin office, Chen said, is to upgrade
Taiwan-Germany  cooperation  in  machinery, and then expand bilateral
exchanges to optical-electric and energy sectors.

    The  ITRI  office  in  Silicon Valley in California is focused on
recruiting high-end electronics know-how, while its Russian office is
aimed at aerospace technology, he added.

TAIWAN-JAPAN JOINT VENTURE FORGED FOR MANUFACTURE OF CIRCUIT FOIL


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA) The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. Friday
sealed  a  joint-venture agreement with three Japanese enterprises to
build a circuit foil plant in Taiwan.

    The  plant, estimated to cost NT$2.25 billion (US$81.81 million),
is  scheduled  to  come on line before the end of 1997, with a yearly
output of 5,100 metric tons of circuit foil.

    The  production  facility will be located in the Toliu Industrial
Park, central Taiwan, occupying an area of 3.1 hectares. Construction
of  the  plant  is slated to begin in July. The investment project is
pending the final approval of the Economics Ministry.

    Taisugar  will  hold  a  45  percent  stake  in the joint-venture
project  while  Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. will control a 25 percent
interest  and  Nichimen  Corp.  and  Circuit  Foil  Japan will own 20
percent and 10 percent, respectively.

    "The  design  of  the  plant and manufacturing technology will be
provided  by  Circuit  Foil Japan," Taisugar President Chien Pin-tsai
said,  adding  that  except  for  some  machines,  the  bulk  of  the
manufacturing equipment the plant needs is available in Taiwan.

    According  to Chien, Taiwan consumes about 25,000 tons of circuit
foil a year, 12,000 tons of which relies on import. Circuit foil is a
key  material  used in circuit boards and a wide range of electronics
products.

    Masaya  Imayi,  standing  board director of Furukawa Electric and
who  was  present  to ink the agreement, said the investment decision
was  prompted  by the booming development of the electronics industry
in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Asian region.

    "Taiwan is expected to play a pivotal role in Furukawa Electric's
global operation strategy," Imayi said.

    Furukawa  has been manufacturing and marketing circuit foil since
1961 and has emerged as the largest supplier of foil used in printing
circuit boards in Japan.

    Furukawa has NT$160 billion (US$5.81 billion) in annual revenues,
while  Nichimen,  one of the top eight trading firms in Japan, boasts
NT$2 trillion. Of the 10,000 tons of circuit foil Taiwan imports from
Japan each year, 50-70 percent is transacted through Nichimen.

TAICHUNG EPZ EXPORTS UP IN FIRST 8 MONTHS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  The  Taichung  Export  Processing Zone
exported  US$536  million worth of products in the first eight months
of  this  year,  up from US$526 million in the same period last year,
according  to  statistics released Saturday by the EPZ Administration
under the Economics Ministry.

    The  zone  imported  US$287  million  worth  of materials between
January  and August, down from US$293 million in the same period last
year, the statistics showed.

    The  precision  machinery  industry  led  others  with exports of
US$265  million,  accounting  for  49.41  percent of the zone's total
outbound shipments.

    Electrical/electronics machinery manufacturing ranked second with
exports of US$216 million, or 40.42 percent of the total.

    Most  of  the zone's exports went to Japan, which absorbed US$253
million,  or  47.21 percent, of the zone's total exports, followed by
Hong  Kong  with  US$104  million,  or  19.56 percent, the statistics
showed.

    Japan also was the leading source of imports. Taichung EPZ bought
in  US$228  million  worth  of  goods  from  Japan in the eight-month
period, accounting for 79.42 percent of total imports in the zone.

    A  total  of 45 enterprises were operating in the Taichung Export
Processing  Zone  at  the  end  of August, with cumulative investment
topping US$221 million, EPZ Administration officials said.

    Booming  exports  and  imports in the zone indicate manufacturers
have   full   confidence  in  the  zone,  which  is  developing  high
technology, high quality, high value-added products.

LOUISIANA HOPES TO RESUME CROCODILE MEAT EXPORTS TO TAIWAN


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Houston,  Sept.  13  (CNA)  The  Louisiana state government hopes
Louisiana  can  resume  exports  of  crocodile  meat  to  Taiwan, Roy
Johnson, director of market development under the state's Agriculture
and Forestry Department, said Friday.

    Johnson said Taiwan once imported 10 containers of crocodile meat
from  the  United States in 1992, but the meat was banned from import
in 1993 because of wildlife protection issues.

    He  said  crocodile meat produced in the US comes from farms that
also raise chickens and cows, so the crocodile meat, like chicken and
beef, has nothing to do with wildlife protection.

    Hong Kong, Britain, Belgium, and Germany also import US crocodile
meat,  while  South  Korea,  Hong  Kong, Singapore, Italy, and France
import crocodile leather.

    American  businessmen  once  tried  to  export  crocodile meat to
Shanghai, but the deal fell through because of price differences.

    Resumption  of  crocodile meat exports to Taiwan was raised while

'NEW TAIWAN EXPERIENCE ERA' HAS BEGUN, SAYS LEE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA) President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday that
a  "new  Taiwan  experience  era"  began  when  the Republic of China
completed  the  first popular presidential election in 5,000 years of
Chinese history in March.

    The pivotal task for Taiwan now is to ensure a solid existence of
the  Republic of China in the face of a volatile future, Lee said. To
reach  that  goal,  he noted, "We must stabilize society, broaden our
international   horizons,  and  accelerate  exchanges  with  mainland
China."

    Addressing  the  Third  National  Management  Forum  which opened
Thursday  at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, Lee called on the Taiwan public,
particularly  the  business  sector  to  "avoid  jumping  the gun and
exercise  patience"  in the face of a renewed economic offensive from
mainland China.

    Lee  said Beijing has recently stepped up its economic offensive,
a  strategy designed to gain political aims through commercial means.
While luring Taiwan civilians and businessmen to press the government
to adopt policies in its favor, Beijing is also trying to agitate the
society of Taiwan, he pointed out.

    Lee  told the forum, which pulled together more than 400 business
and industrial leaders of the country, that the government will spare
no effort to improve Taiwan's investment climate.

    He said he will ask related government agencies to see to it that
all   investment   barriers,   including   the   difficulty  in  land
acquisition,  are  addressed within six months to expedite investment
here at home. A special desk will be established soon exclusively for
handling land-related problems, and the processing for each case will
be handled in no longer than two months, Lee promised.

    Outdated  and  inefficient regulations must go to create a better
investment  environment,  he  added.  Taking Japan as an example, Lee
said  that  despite  government's  efforts to cut interest rates, the
Japanese  economy  has not been able to break out of its recession in
seven  or  eight years because superannuated regulations and statutes
there have blocked the way and choked off investment willingness.

    During  the  three-day  forum,  Taiwan's  business and industrial
leaders  expressed  confidence  in the country's future and agreed to
pitch  in  more  than NT$100 billion (US$3.6 billion) in the next two
years for investment projects on the island.

TAIWAN 'KAMIKAZE SQUAD' VOWS TO BLOW UP DISPUTED LIGHTHOUSE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Six men with criminal records Saturday
formed  a  death  squad  and  pledged  to destroy the lighthouse they
claimed  was  erected illegally by a Japanese right-wing group on one
of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.

    The  six  men,  all of which received diving and bombing training
when  they  served  in  the  army,  met  the  press and displayed the
testament they signed.

    The  group  guaranteed  they  would  blow  up  the  solar-powered
lighthouse  set  up  on one of the Tiaoyutais in the middle of May by
the Japan Youth Federation.

    The uninhabitated islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan, lie in
the  East  China Sea about 200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300
kilometers west of Japan's Okinawa Island. Taiwan, mainland China and
Japan all lay sovereignty claims over the islands.

    "Should  any  one  of  them  die of natural disaster or any other
reason  on  their  voyage  to  the  Tiaoyutais,  their families would
receive  NT$600,000  each,"  said  Tung Nien-tai, head of a center to
provide  services  to  former  inmates.  Tung said he would raise the
money from the public, if needed.

    The  blitz  plans  are  underway,  Tung  said,  adding  that  the
operation would be launched soon.

    Tung said that under his draft plans, the group would swim ashore
after  being  brought  by a boat to waters about a nautical mile from
the lighthouse.

    No government officials were immediately available for comment.

    Saturday's  announcement  came  as the international dispute over
the  Tiaoyutais  was  escalating.  After  the  lighthouse was set up,
another  Japanese  ultra-right  group,  the  Senkaku  Islands Defense
Association, in mid-August planted a wooden Japanese flag and erected
a war memorial on the largest of the islands.

    The  provocative moves  have  triggered  a  strong  response from
Chinese  communities  in the United States, mainland China, Hong Kong
and  Taiwan.  While  some  groups  protested  to  Japanese government
officials stationed in their area, others have called for an alliance
of  the Chinese throughout the world to stand tough against what they
called a "Japanese invasion" of Chinese territory.

    In  Taipei,  the  government  of the Republic of China, saying it
wants  to  settle  the  dispute with Japan peacefully, has repeatedly
urged  the  Japanese  government  to  restrain its people from taking
further provocative actions.

NO CONSENSUS IN US-TAIWAN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CONSULTATIONS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  While Taiwan has just been told by the
United  States  that  it  will  be  removed  from  the  "Special 301"
blacklist  for  having achieved satisfactory progress in intellectual
property  rights  (IPR)  protection,  it may face a fresh threat from
Washington over its new medical equipment pricing policy.

    No  consensus was reached Saturday in a US-Taiwan consultation on
Taiwan's pricing policy for medical equipment, and whether Washington
will  list  Taiwan  under  its  "Super  301" bill for trade sanctions
remains to be seen.

    David  Burns,  chief officer in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs at
the  office  of  the  US Trade Representative (USTR), on Saturday met
with  officials  from the Department of Health (DOH) and the National
Health  Insurance  Bureau (NHIB) on NHIB's pricing policy for medical
equipment and related products.

    The  two  parties  failed  to reach any consensus, and decided to
meet again on Monday for another round of talks.

    The  USTR  office  was  reported earlier this week to have listed
Taiwan  as a "priority country" under its annual "Super 301" bill for
trade   sanctions   after   the   US  Health  Industry  Manufacturers
Association filed an accusation saying Taiwan's new medical equipment
pricing policy is "non-transparent and discriminates against American
suppliers."

    Burns   said  Taiwan's  implementation  of  the  national  health
insurance  program  is  highly  commendable.  But it takes effort and
expertise  to  ensure  the  public's  access  to quality medicine and
medical  equipment.  He  said  American  medical equipment comes with
quality,  and  Taiwanese  patients  have  the  right  to  use quality
products.

    USTR  officials will continue to exchange views with DOH and NHIB
officials  in  the  next two weeks on the pricing policy, Burns said,
adding  that  his office will not make any decision until Sept. 30 on
whether to recommend a "Super 301" listing for retaliation.

    Yeh Chin-chuan, general manager of the NHIB, said the new medical
equipment  pricing  policy  is consistent with the national treatment
principle  set by the World Trade Organization, as it applies to both
local and foreign suppliers.

    Foreign  suppliers  can  file  their complaints to Taiwan if they
want  to  challenge  the  policy, and the NHIB will review the policy
periodically, Yeh added.

    Yeh  hoped  that all misunderstandings will be solved in the next
round of talks on Monday. If not, he said, NHIB officials will travel
to the United States later this month for further talks.

CHANG ASKS JAPAN TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Foreign Affairs Minister John Chang on
Saturday  reiterated  his  call  for  Japan  to exercise restraint in
handling  the  territorial dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands, or the
Senkakus to the Japanese.

    Chang,  however,  would  not  comment  on the report that Beijing
authorities,   faced  with  mounting  pressure  from  its  people  to
safeguard  the  Tiaoyutai Islands, have asked activists to cool their
activity.

    Chang made the remarks after attending a reception in celebration
of  the  175th  Independence  Anniversary  of  the  five countries in
Central America.

    Vice  Foreign  Affairs  Minister  Cheng  Chien-jen  said  the ROC
government's position on the issue is crystal clear. "The ROC insists
on  sovereignty  over  the islands, but is hoping to settle the issue
through  peaceful means and is not planning to cooperate with Beijing
on the matter."

    Observers  from  here  and  abroad have urged Taipei and Beijing,
which  are  still  technically at war since 1949, to work together in
negotiating with Japan.

    The  Tiaoyutais  lie  in  the East China Sea about 200 kilometers
northeast  of  Taiwan  and  300  kilometers  west  of Japan's Okinawa
Island.  Taipei,  Beijing  and  Tokyo  all claim sovereignty over the
uninhabitated islands.

    Chang  also  declined  to  comment on  the  report  that  a local
rightest  organization  is  planning to send a death squad to blow up
the  lighthouse erected by a Japanese group on one of the islands. "I
have no knowledge of the report," Chang said.

    Cheng  said  he  could understand the patriotism some people have
toward  the  country,  but  he  stressed  that calmness is definitely
needed to settle the issue.

    He  also  urged the public to have faith in the government. "From
the  government's  point of view, the priority we always have in mind
is what is in the best interests of the country and people."

    Cheng said Tokyo is expected to propose a date for a second round
of  talks  on a fisheries agreement. The two sides held a closed-door
meeting in Taipei on Aug. 3., but did not arrive at an agreement.

5 CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Five Central American countries held a
cocktail party and opened a painting exhibition in Taipei Saturday to
celebrate the 175th anniversary of their nations' independence.

    Many  ROC  government  officials  and foreign envoys attended the
celebration activities sponsored by El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

    ROC  Foreign  Minister  John  Chang said at the party that Taiwan
shares  close  and  friendly relations with the five Central American
countries,  and ROC President Lee Teng-hui will visit Central America
next year.

    Despite  difficulties each of the Central American countries have
faced,  their  pursuit  of  democracy  and constitutional politics is
admired around the world, Chang said.

    Chang  said  the ROC and its diplomatic allies in Central America
have  the  same  political  ideals  and goal of peace, adding that he
hopes  freedom,  democracy, and equitable distribution of wealth will
arrive as early as possible.

    The  painting  exhibition,  which  featured  100  works by modern
painters  from  Central  America,  as  well as 29 masterpieces from a
Costa  Rican  museum,  will  help  boost  cultural interflows between
Taiwan  and the five countries. The art show is being held at the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall Sept. 14-25.

    Also  present  at  the  party  were  Control  Yuan President Wang
Tso-jung, Deputy Secretary-General to the President Chen Hsi-fan, and
art figures from home and abroad.

regional affairs.

affairs and said China has a special position in Africa.

China: Paris symposium to look at China"s policy on foreign investment

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A symposium on China's foreign investment policy, sponsored by the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC),
opened in Paris on Monday.

Chen Xinhua, deputy minister of MOFTEC, briefed French participants on
the economic situation and foreign investment in China in his keynote
speech at the opening ceremony.

"Foreign funded enterprises have actually invested a total of 155
billion U.S. dollars in China and the majority of joint ventures and
solely foreign funded enterprises are well managed," Chen said.

With the continuous growth of Sino-French economic and trade relations
in recent years, France had become the fourth largest European investor
in China, he said.

Yves Galland, minister delegate to the French Ministry of Economy and
Finance in charge of finance and foreign trade, said developing
relations with China was a priority of the French government.

France was determined to seize the "huge opportunity" of the Chinese
market, he said.

France encouraged its businessmen to invest in China, because China had
created sound conditions for foreign investment, he said. He noted that
China had brought inflation under control while ensuring the continuous
and fast expansion of the economy.

Galland said China's foreign currency reserves and the purchasing power
of its consumers were quickly increasing.

He hoped the Chinese side would do a better job in helping foreign
enterprises obtain more accurate market information in China and learn
more about the Chinese laws and regulations.

More than 170 delegates from China's provinces attended the symposium.
They brought with them a long list of 640 projects that are open to
foreign investment.

China: Hi-tech industry leads in Yantai"s economy: official

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Hi-tech industry in China's port city Yantai has become a leader in the
local economy, a government official there said recently.

Yantai, in east China's Shandong Province, has established 406
enterprises that develop or manufacture hi-tech products, accounting
for a quarter of the city's total.

Hi-tech enterprises generated a total output value of 6.2 billion yuan
(about 747 million US dollars) and 1.6 billion yuan ($192 million) in
taxes and profits last year.

In recent years, Yantai has implemented the strategy of "invigorating
the city's economy through science and technology," and has given
favorable treatment to hi-tech enterprises in land use, funding, power
supply and intelligence.

Large state-owned enterprises have pioneered the development of hi-tech
industries. The city has selected 100 enterprises to upgrade
traditional industries and old products.

The Yantai Wanhua Synthetic Leather Group Company has broken the
monopoly of foreign technology in the development of high-grade
imitation synthetic leather.

By keeping up-to-date with the latest global developments in
technology, the Polaris Clock Corporation has become the largest clock
company in China.

Technology-intensive joint ventures have also sprung up in the city.
Most of the 150 projects boast state-of-the-art technology, the
official said.

Yantai presently has one of the four largest manufacturing bases of
transparent electric conduction glass in the world, which was formed in
cooperation with an American company.

By cooperating with another US company, the city has produced a special
sealing gum, which satisfies 90 per cent of the demand of the country's
market.

Yantai has also cooperated with a Japanese company for the production
of automobile air conditioners. The city also joined hands with a
company from the Republic of Korea to make excavators, a project that
is expected to generate an output value of one billion US dollars
annually.

Township enterprises also play an active role in the development of
hi-tech products. Household appliances developed by the Hongxiang
Company sells well in the overseas market. Last year, the company
turned out a production volume of 1.3 billion yuan ($156 million).  And
Zhichu Group, a village-run company, has developed 28 hi-tech products.

The city has set up 450 hi-tech industries, covering the fields of
electronic information, integration of machinery and electronics, new
materials, bio-engineering, mechanics, medicine, and household
appliances.

Shanghai to develop environmental protection into a pillar sector

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

As Shanghai tries to simultaneously improve its economy and
environment, experts in both fields predict that the environmental
protection industry will become one of the city's pillar sectors early
next century.

The Shanghai Municipal Government is encouraging big State-owned
enterprises to enter this market, which has been expanding due to the
launching of many large environmental projects, such as the sewage
treatment and water diversion project on the Yangtze River, a report by
the local Business News said.

During the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) period, Shanghai's
investment in environmental protection will total 48 billion yuan ($5.8
billion). Investment in the field in the whole country will be 189
billion yuan ($23 billion), according to the report.

In contrast to the market's potential, Shanghai's environmental
protection industry is relatively underdeveloped.

There are about 600 firms in the field, employing 40,000 people, and
industrial output last year was 1.5 billion yuan ($180 million),
according to the Shanghai Bureau of Environmental Protection.

Market enthusiasm is on the rise. Multinational companies, as well as
firms in other provinces in China, are planning to enter the Shanghai
market, and local companies, not willing to be left behind, are also
considering investment options.

Shanghai Environmental Protection Machinery & Engineering Co is one of
them.

The company's core business, Shanghai Metallurgical & Mine Machinery
Plant, is one of the earliest firms in China to produce environmental
protection machinery for dust cleaning, desulfurization, water and
garbage treatment.

The company has acquired long term, interest-free loans from the
overseas capital market and a 70-million-yuan ($8.4 million) loan from
Chinese banks for expansion, the report said.

China: Shenzhen to separate government organs from market agencies

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

All market go-between organizations in special economic zone Shenzhen,
are to be separated from government institutions in a campaign to
rectify market order.

Also as part of the effort government employees will not be allowed to
be involved as market agents.

As a pioneer for China's socialist market economy, Shenzhen
neighbouring Hong Kong, now boasts over 3,300 market go-between
organizations, employing over 35,000 people, latest statistics show.

While playing an increasingly important role in bridging ties between
the market with enterprises and the government, problems have been
found among as well as the malpractice of taking advantage of
government ties, resulting in unfair competition.

In its determination to maintain market order, the municipal government
has decided to carry out an over-all check on the go-between market,
covering job introductions, real estate dealing, assets assessment, and
law firms.

Existing relevant rules and regulations will also be subject to
re-examination.

China: FM spokesman warns Japan not to cause ""new incident""

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Japan should understand that the Chinese people's determination to
defend China's State sovereignty and territorial integrity is
unshakable, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday in Beijing.

Spokesman Shen Guofang warned Japan to be fully aware of the
seriousness of the matter and not to provoke any new incidents.

His remarks came in response to the report that Japanese coast guard
and police vessels expelled Hong Kong vessels which tried to approach
the Diaoyu Islands.

Japan has created disturbances continuously on the Diaoyu Islands
issue, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, Shen said.

This of course arouses strong indignation among the entire Chinese
people, including compatriots of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he said.

When asked to comment on Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda's
claim at the UN General Assembly of the United Nations that the islands
are Japan's territory, Shen said that China's position on this issue
has never changed.

It is indisputable that the Diaoyu Islands and its adjacent islands are
an inalienable part of China, he said.

He urged Japan to take steps to stop activities which infringe on
China's sovereignty and said that Japan is responsible to make sure
that no new incidents will take place.

Referring to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's upcoming meeting
with the Dalai Lama on coming Thursday, Shen reiterated that this
constitutes an interference into China's internal affairs.

Whatever the outcome, a shadow will surely be casted over bilateral
relations, Shen said.

China has made many representations with the Australian government and
hopes that it will take a correct attitude, he said.

Commenting on the report that Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui has asked
to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Shen said
Asian-Pacific countries have conducted fruitful dialogues on security
issues, which can only be held among sovereignty countries.

Taiwan, which is part of China, is not at all qualified to take part in
such activities, Shen said.

Also at the briefing, Shen said that, looking back at history, the
country which had constituted a threat to the Asia-Pacific region was
none other than Japan.

"Peace in the Asia-Pacific region should be maintained by this region's
countries and peoples," Shen said.

These remarks were made when Shen was asked to comment on the
US-Japanese security communique released last week.

He said if this agreement, which is a bilateral arrangement, exceeds
bilateral range and is aimed against a third country or involves other
countries' interests, complications will result in the development of
the matter.

He expressed the hope that Japan will have a clear understanding of the
issue.

China welcomes US investors and traders: Vice Premier

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing yesterday told the Illinois State Trade
Delegation, headed by Governor Jim Edgar, that China welcomes American
companies to invest in the country and conduct trade here.

China welcomes investment in China from big businesses, such as
Motorola, as well as cooperation with small and medium-sized
enterprises, Li said in a meeting yesterday afternoon with the group.

According to Li, the economies of China and the US are complementary,
and show great potential for economic cooperation.

He said he hopes the two sides will work more closely with each other
to fully explore their opportunities.

The vice-premier stressed that only when the two countries respect
dissimilarities in each other's culture and history can cooperation be
effective.

Edgar echoed Li's views by saying that differences in political
opinions should not influence economic cooperation. In fact, he said,
the establishment of stronger trade ties between US and China might
help solve political issues.

Li also briefed the US guests on China's major areas for foreign
investment. He said he believes that the forthcoming visit by Wu Yi,
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, to the Unites
States will enhance trade ties between the two countries.

China: Song Jian emphasizes on environmental protection

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Environmental protection is the key to sustainable development, said
State Councillor Song Jian in Beijing Tuesday.

Speaking at the fifth meeting of the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development, Song said China, as a
developing country, is always burdened with economic development and
environmental protection issues.

In order to realize the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the
national economy, China should solve both the environmental pollution
problems that have been left over from past, as well as the new
environmental problems that crop up in the process of development.

The council is a non-governmental advisory body consisting of Chinese
government officials, internationally-recognized figures, high-ranking
foreign officials, noted experts and professors. Suggestions made by
the council have been well received by the Chinese government.

Song said that people have reached a common understanding of the
importance of sustainable development, and that planning of economic
development must be done in connection with population, resources and
environment.

He said that China has made significant progress in the protection of
environment, but the country's environmental situation is still grim:
environmental pollution, especially in cities, continues to be
aggravating, and the areas suffering from ecological destruction are
expanding.

In some areas, environmental pollution and ecological damage have
obstructed the healthy development of the economy, and even pose direct
threats to people's health, he added.

Song said that at present, environmental protection should focus on
dealing with the comprehensive relationship between environment and
development, legal construction, expanding financial resources,
increasing input, using science and technology, expanding international
cooperation and implementing international conventions on environment.

China among 1st to sign Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China was among the first countries to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) at the United Nations headquarters this morning.

Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, representing
China, signed the treaty.

Also among the first group to sign the treaty were the United States,
France, Russia and Britain.

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a key note speech
before the signing of the treaty that it was "a major milestone" that
has been reached on the road to making the world a safer and more
secure place for generations to come.

In a statement on the occasion, the Chinese government declared that
China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons and the realization of a
nuclear-weapon-free world.

The statement said that it is in favor of a comprehensive ban on
nuclear weapon test explosions in the process towards this objective.
The Chinese government is deeply convinced that the CTBT will
facilitate nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, it added.

Therefore, it said, "China supports the conclusion, through
negotiation, of a fair, reasonable and verifiable treaty with universal
adherence and unlimited duration and is ready to take active measures
to promote its ratification and entry into force."

Meanwhile, the Chinese government appealed that major nuclear weapon
states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence. States with
huge arsenals should continue to drastically reduce their nuclear
stockpiles, it said.

The statement said, "All countries that have deployed nuclear weapons
on foreign soil should withdraw all of them to their own land. All
nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstance, commit
themselves unconditionally to the non-use or threat of use of nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones,
and conclude, at an early date, international legal instruments to this
effect."

China called on all nuclear weapon states to pledge their support to
proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, respect
their status as such and undertake corresponding obligations.

The statement said no country should develop or deploy space weapon
systems or missile defense systems undermining strategic security and
stability.

And an international convention on the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded through
negotiations, it added.

The statement said that the Chinese government endorses the application
of verification measures consistent with the provisions of the CTBT to
ensure its faithful implementation and at the same time it firmly
opposes the abuse of verification rights by any country, including the
use of espionage or human intelligence, to infringe upon the
sovereignty of other countries and impair their legitimate security
interests in violation of universally recognized principles of
international law.

It said that in the present day world where huge nuclear arsenals and
nuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of nuclear weapons
still exist, the supreme national interests of China demand that it
ensure the safety, reliability and effectiveness of its nuclear weapons
before the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons is achieved.

China: High-tech code system developed to combat fake goods

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

A high-tech system that uses secret codes to combat fake goods in China
is to go national after a successful trial operation.

The system, invented by Chinese experts, uses a telephone network and
electronic codes to identify genuine articles. A national work
conference held in Haikou of Hainan Province to discuss the system has
been told it is to be spread nationwide after been proved successful.

Its trial operation in parts of the country since January this year
received positive response from users.

China Anti-Fakes Association is entrusted by the State Bureau of
Technical Supervision to popularize it throughout the country.

Hainan Tenglong Anti-Fake Technology Company, which is based in Haikou,
capital of Hainan in South China, is responsible for implementing the
project.

The system, based on computerized data banks and the national
computerized telephone information retrieval network, will provide
manufacturers of quality products with special data codes and secret
codes.

Commodity dealers or buyers can check up the goods they have purchased
by telephone, after tearing off the cover on the codes.

Since it is a hi-tech system, it is impossible for anyone to produce
fake codes, according to experts.

The Hainan-based company has invested 40 million yuan ($4.8 million) to
set up a data bank capable of holding 50 billion different electronic
codes. Terminals will be built in major cities across the country.

Some experts say the network will help protect quality and brand-famed
products in the country.

China: Nujiang River Canyon gains growing popularity among tourists

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Nujiang River Canyon, known as the "Grand Canyon of the Orient"
 has become a hot tourist attraction as increasing travelers and
adventurers swarm in.

Located in the west of Yunnan Province, southwest China, the Nujiang
River Canyon is grand and steep because of the swift Nujiang River, the
perilous Biluo Mountain and the Gaoligong Mountain on each bank of the
river.

The Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Canyon is 621 kilometers long
and 3,000 meters deep, as compared with the Grand Canyon in Colorado
which is 440 kilometers long and 1,839 meters deep.

Tourists visiting the Nujiang Grand Canyon can not only see the canyon
itself, but can also be exposed to the rich ethnic culture and folklore
of the local Lisu, Bai, Nu, Dulong, Jingpo and Tibetan ethnic groups.

The primeval forests, waterfalls and rivers are also tourist
highlights.

Thanks to modern highways, it takes 10 hours for tourists to get to the
canyon from Kunming, the provincial capital.

Last year, over 194,000 Chinese and overseas tourists visited the
canyon.

Shanghai to import German escalators for Metro Line No. 2

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai Metro Corp and a German firm have agreed to import 120
escalators for the first phase of the city's Metro Line No 2, which is
scheduled to be completed in 1999.

The 120 computer-controlled heavy-duty escalators cost 24.5 million
Deutsche marks ($16 million) and will be designed and manufactured by
Otis Escalator Factory in Stadthagen, Germany.

These escalators will be installed by Shanghai Otis Elevator Corp in 10
subway stations -- four West Shanghai and six in Pudong (East
Shanghai), said an official from the company.

The 3-year-old Shanghai Otis has installed numerous state-of-the-art,
computer-controlled elevators in major projects throughout Shanghai,
including the Oriental Pearl TV Tower.

The escalators for the Metro project will begin arriving in April, the
official said.

Germany will also provide four escalators for the extension of Metro
Line No 1 from Jinjiang Amusement Park to Xinzhuang.

The extension will open at the end of the year, said Chen Mingtu, chief
of the Foreign Economic Division under Shanghai Metro Co.

This is the second project by Otis for Shanghai metros, the Otis
official said, adding that Otis installed 48 heavy-duty escalators for
Metro Line No 1.

Chen said the metro company will soon sign a contract with the United
States to import subway ticket machines worth $24 million. The machines
will be installed on Metro Lines No 1 and No 2.

The city borrowed $50 million from the United States Government to
import subway ticket machines, signal and anti-fire systems.

The city also will import 210 carriages. Most will be for the first
phase of the second subway, and 16 will be used on Metro Line No 1 to
increase the frequency of train trips from every seven minutes to every
five minutes.

China: Ministry to help upgrade machine plants in northeast China

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's Ministry of Machinery plans to finance the technological
upgrading projects of major machine-building plants in northeast of the
country.

The aim is to boost the growth of an important sector that employs a
quarter of all the area's workers.

The companies to receive government assistance will include
manufacturers of power generation, transformers and transmission
facilities, lathe-builders and suppliers of important fittings and
parts in the bearing industry.

The funding will also be granted to manufacturers of light and heavy
automotives, according to Deputy Minister Sun Changji, who was recently
interviewed by reporter in Liaoning coastal city Dalian.

According to the official, 104 such projects have been approved by the
ministry, involving a total investment of 5.3 billion yuan ($630
million).

The northeastern region normally covers Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning, as well as the eastern part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. The area is an old industrial base of the country.

The machinery industry makes up 25.73 percent of the region's total
industrial production value.

The ministry has urged the machinery sector in the northeast to carry
out managerial reforms to revive the old industrial base.

China: Qian Qichen urges EU to support China"s entry into WTO

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qicheng Monday urged the
European Union to take more active steps to support China's efforts in
entering the World Trade Organization.

He made this remark during his meeting with his counterpart of the
European Union in New York.

Qian pointed out that in recent years the overall relationship between
China and EU is developing in a good direction.

He said China values the important role the EU and its members are
playing in the international affairs and wishes to develop friendly and
co-operative relationship with them.

On economic and trade relations, Qian said there is great potential for
development since the two sides are economically complementary.

He said China will continue the process of opening up to the outside
world and liberalizing its trade practices.

He called upon the EU countries to take more positive steps in
eliminating protective trade barriers against Chinese products and to
take positive and concrete measures on the questions of China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.

Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, the current EU president, told Qian
that EU is determined in pursuing the long-term policy of developing
strategic relationship with China.

Noting the dialogue between China and EU has already had a good
beginning, Dick said that the EU is willing to continue such a dialogue
so as to enhance understanding and reduce differences.

Spring told Qian that the EU supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, hoping the question can be solved on an equal and
just base.

On the human rights issue, Qian reaffirmed China's consistent policy
that is to carry out dialogues with other countries on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.

China believes that dialogues and confrontation cannot be mixed
together. If any country wishes to seek dialogues with China, it should
discard the stance of confrontation, he added.

On behalf of the European Union, Hans Van Mierlo expressed his
gratitude for the flexibility and constructive spirit China had
demonstrated in the negotiations for settling the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT). He said China had made important contribution to the
successful adoption of the treaty earlier this months.

The Chinese vice-premier said that China had been actively involved in
the CTBT negotiations, holding that it would be the first step taken
toward the final target of a comprehensive ban and complete destruction
of nuclear weapons. He said the international community should continue
its efforts in this regard.

China: No 1 Department Store wins top int"l laurels

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Shanghai No 1 Department Store, one of the most prestigious department
stores in the city, has become the first retailer in the country to win
the ISO9002, an international award for management and service.

The International Standard Organization gives the certificate to
businesses which it considers are among the best in the world.

``As Shanghai opens its retail markets, the competition grows keener.
The advent of foreign retailers has put our traditional management and
service under challenge,'' Zhang Yinqi, general manager of the store
said at the award ceremony held recently.

``Although we are experienced in the retail sector, we are in need of
modernization. So we decided to commit ourselves to setting up a
quality management and guarantee system in line with international
standards,'' said Zhang.

Founded in October 1949, the Shanghai No 1 Department Store is one of
the leaders in the world of commerce in China. Its seven-story shopping
facility at a premier location on bustling Nanjing Road, along with a
number of branch stores in and out of the city, chalked up sales of
2.33 billion yuan ($280.7 million) and a profit of 123 million yuan
($14.8 million) in 1995. For 11 years in a row, it was the country's
busiest store in terms of sales.

For the first half of 1996, it registered sales of 1.22 billion yuan
($147 million), up 12.9 per cent over a year earlier.

The preparation for ISO9002 accreditation was initiated in December
1994 at the store. The store got all of its senior and middle-level
staff re-trained and worked out a series of quality management
regulations.

According to Zhang, customers shopping at the No 1 Department Store are
guaranteed with satisfaction. One area where the store should win good
response is its policy of offering refunds or exchanges on bought
goods.

``Rather than resting on its laurels, the No 1 Department Store will
seek further expansion and make itself a world-famous shopping
paradise.'' Zhang said.

China: 50 reporters granted awards for fighting copyright piracy

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

China's State Copyright Administration yesterday rewarded 50 reporters
who have helped fight copyright piracy over the past few years.

The reporters work for Xinhua News Agency, "The People's Daily", China
Central Television, and many other news organizations throughout the
country.

"Mass media is playing a major role in promoting people's awareness of
copyright protection," said Yu Youxian, director of the administration.

He said that the Chinese media has published tens of thousands of
stories to demonstrate the significance of copyright protection and
spread information in this regard.

Many people reported copyright cases to the authorities after reading
newspapers, according to Shen Rengan, deputy director of the
administration. He added that it was unusual for a country to mobilize
all its public sectors, including the media, to engage in the fight
against copyright piracy.

Yu Youxian explained that the improvement of people's legal sense by
making use of the media has become a basic guarantee to implement the
copyright law.

The prize-winning stories themselves are a showcase that China has
achieved great progress in protecting copyright, he noted.

He cited some articles, including one describing how farmers become
familiar with the copyright law, one about the Walt Disney's case in
Beijing, and another on copyright protection in a fast food restaurant.

Some reporters lashed the US for its unfair charge that China violated
foreign copyrights. One journalist even told a story about a senior
Chinese copyright official whose works were pirated in the US without
authorization.

China: Shanxi plans to harness half of its soil erosion by year 2000

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Shanxi Province plans to harness 50 per cent of its soil
erosion area by the year 2000.

Thanks to years of efforts to harness the Loess Plateau, Shanxi has so
far contained 51 million mu (3.06 million hectares), or 32 per cent of
its total eroded area.

Shanxi, located near the middle reaches of the Yellow River, occupies a
large part of the Loess Plateau. Soil erosion area accounts for 70 per
cent of its total 156,000 square kilometer of ground.

In the late 1970s, the annual amount of sand washed into the Yellow
River stood at 366 million tons -- one-fourth of the river's total.

A large-scale campaign to harness the Loess Plateau first began in the
1980s. Over the following several years, 350,000 local rural households
participated in the drive.

By planting grass, trees and crops, and building dams and terraced
farmland, the residents revived hundreds of thousands of barren
gullies.

Meanwhile, the central government and the Shanxi provincial government
also worked to prevent the spread of erosion in the Loess Plateau.

The central government has invested 75 million yuan to tackle erosion
of the banks of the Sanchuan River and Yongding River, two large rivers
on the plateau. Eroded areas which have been controlled there account
for 40 percent of the total drainage area of the two rivers.

A total of 150 million yuan ($18 million) has been used in harnessing
the upper reaches of the Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of
the Yellow River.

Erosion-harnessing projects were carried out on an area of 1.95 million
mu (117,000 hectares) there. In the region, grain output increased by
50 percent, farmers' income rose two-fold, and the volume of sand which
washed into reservoirs was reduced by 49 per cent.

China: Multi-billion yuan petrochemical project planned for Qaidam Basin

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. n 1996

China is to build a 4.3 billion yuan ($510 million) petrochemical
project in the Qaidam Basin, Northwest China's Qinghai Province.

This was disclosed by Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the
China National Petroleum Corporation.

Zhou explained that during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan Period
(1996-2000), the country will carry out large-scale exploitation of the
natural gas reserves in the Qaidam Basin. The construction of the
project is aimed at promoting the economic development of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

He added that according to an initial plan, the project will have a
designed annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of polyvinyl
chloride, 100,000 tons of caustic soda, 200,000 tons of synthetic
ammonia and 350,000 tons of urea.

Zhou said that the project had already passed assessment and appraisal
from China International Consultancy Company, and his corporation has
been negotiating over the investment possibility with US company, Amoco
Petroleum.

Qaidam Basin has an area of 240,000 square kilometers, equivalent to
the size of Great Britain, and it is also one of China's four major
basins.

China has discovered 22 oilfields in the Qaidam Basin after more than
four decades of prospecting.  Of the 22 oilfields, six fields, with
combined natural gas reserves of 54.1 billion cubic meters, boast sound
conditions for full-scale development.

In another development, the installation of a 189 km pipeline from
Sebei Oilfield to Golmud City, also located in the basin, which will
form part of the new petrochemical project, has just been finished.

A 16,000-kilowattt power station using natural gas as fuel has also
been built.

Beijing plans expansion of overseas labor service

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Beijing plans to send thousands of experts and skilled people to other
countries as part of a 15-year plan to boost its share of overseas
contracts.

The city has announced an expansion of its overseas labor services and
construction co-operation, with an increase of 10 to 15 per cent
annually, a top municipal official said.

He said by the year 2000, the total turnover of overseas labor services
is expected to reach up to $600 million US dollars, and by $1.4 billion
US dollars by the year 2010.

A number of effective measures are to be taken to achieve the goal,
said Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign Trade
Commission. The most important is to extend overseas contracts and
labor services in accordance with international standards.

By the end of 1995, Beijing had signed contracts for overseas projects
and labor services totalling $2.57 billion US dollar, with a turnover
of $1.13 billion US dollars.

More than 20,000 doctors, scientists and engineers have been sent to
over 50 countries and regions around the world, the official said.

A total 11 enterprises in the city have now been licensed to enjoy the
right to sign overseas contracts for labor services.

Among them, the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction Group Corp is the
biggest, he said.

Last year, the city signed contracts for overseas cooperative projects
and labor services worth $780 million US dollars, earning millions of
dollars in profits for China.

China: Hebei focuses on airport development

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

North China's Hubei Province is embracing a rapid developing aviation
industry, according to a report from Shijiazhuang, the provincial
capital.

Until recently the province saw a slow development in aviation
transport, only starting its first civilian flight in 1984.

But since last year the province has stepped up development of air
travel with the opening of Shijiazhuang Airport. The airport is listed
as one of the alternative airports for Beijing Capital International
Airport.

According to provincial aviation officials, Hebei has opened 17
domestic air routes linking the province with 19 major Chinese cities,
and also an air route to Hong Kong.

By the end of October, Shijiazhuang Airport will open four more
domestic air routes to Kunming, Nanjing, Xiamen and Qingdao, and
chartered flights to Russia are expected to begin later this year.

Situated not far from Beijing and Tianjin, two largest cities in the
country, Hebei is one of the major agriculture production bases and
rich in mineral and tourism resources.

By the end of this century, Hubei will transform Shijiazhuang Airport
into an international airport and build or expand four other major
airports in the province.

China: Hong Kong: big player in overseas investment

from CHINA BUSINESS INFORMATION NETWORK (CBnet), Sep. 25, 1996

Hong Kong has become the single largest outward investor among Asian
developing economies, according to the 1996 issue of the World
Investment Report, which says the outflows of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) from the region amounted to $25 billion US dollars last year.

A good part of the outflows goes into China, says the report released
yesterday in Geneva by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).

The inflows of FDI into Hong Kong, $2.1 billion US dollars in 1995,
fall far short of the outflows.

"It does not imply a loss of confidence in Hong Kong," said Professor
Edward K.Y. Chen, President of Lingnan College at a news conference in
Hong Kong yesterday, who gave a general introduction to the annual
report, the fifth published by UNCTAD since 1992.

In his view, the figures simply reflect normal commercial activities to
rationalize production and accumulate wealth. Hong Kong is a funding
center which draws money from other places of the world and then pours
into China, so the big outflows are not all from Hong Kong investors,
said Chen.

Touching on Hong Kong after 1997, the reports says the city should
continue to be a separate customs territory and an independent member
of the World Trade Organization (WTO). According to Chen, there is good
evidence that the whole world has confidence in Hong Kong so long as it
maintains the current economic independence as stipulated in the Basic
Law, the de facto constitution of the future Special Administrative
Region.

UNCTAD plays an important role in promoting trade and investment
throughout the world.

China: Chemical industry shows off

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

THE latest chemical industry products, equipment and technology are on
show and investment co-operation is being sought at an international
industry fair which opened in Beijing yesterday.

"Current development has already been restricted by problems in funds
and technology, which indicates we must continue to firmly implement
the policy of opening up to the outside world, and fully use the
resources, funds and markets available both at home and abroad," said
He Guoqiang, vice-minister of chemical industry at the fair's
opening.

According to He, the fair, which runs from September 23 to 27 in the
China International Exhibition Centre, has so far drawn 95 overseas
chemical industry enterprises from 20 countries and regions, as well
as about 2,000 domestic enterprises.

Domestic participants are profiling about 120 projects for
co-operation and highlighting nearly 160 types of technology and
equipment for export.

"I am very happy to see there are new trends in co-operation between
foreign chemical circles and China's chemical industry over the last
couple of years," He said.

He cited four obvious changes, including the shifts: from simple
import of technology to all-round co-operation in scientific
research, production, personnel training and environmental
protection; from investments in individual projects to participation
in regional development of economic zones; from small projects to
those on a larger scale with a substantial amount of investment and
high technology content; and from co-operation with only a few large
companies to co-operation including medium and small-sized
enterprises.

In the ongoing Ninth Five-Year Plan, the industry will stress three
priorities: agrochemicals, such as fertilizer and pesticides, will be
further developed to meet the growing demands of agricultural
production; the petrochemical industry will be vigorously developed
by accelerating the production of organic raw materials, organic
intermediates, synthetic materials and fine and specialty chemicals
to support other pillar industries like the mechanical, electronic,
automobile manufacturing and building industries; and production of
high-tech and high value-added products will be expanded.

China: Scientists to document earliest dynasties

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

EDITOR'S note:

Starting this year, a State project to determine the chronology of
early Chinese history in the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties will be
carried out by the country's top historians and scientists. The
project, which is meant to give a clear, coherent picture of China's
beginnings, is the first of its kind supported by the government. It
is also considered an unprecedented co-operative effort between two
fields -- science and history.

Feature writers of China Daily have talked with the project's
initiator, State Councillor Song Jian, as well as project leader Li
Xueqin, archaeologist Li Boqian, astronomer Zhang Peiyu, Chinese
language professor Qiu Xigui and other scientists concerned. The
following is a series of articles on the interviews in today's and
tomorrow's page 9.

By Li Xing and Gong Qian

CHINA'S top historians and scientists will put their heads together to
develop a cohesive chronology of early Chinese history.

The project, which will be concluded in about three years, is intended
to create a dynasty outline dating to the Xia and early Shang eras,
noting the dates of each king's reign from Shang to Zhou dynasties.

The project is the brainchild of State Councillor Song Jian, a
scientist who specializes in astronautics and system control.

"We work together and apply modern science to the study of history,
provide convincing scientific bases, and give a more clear history to
our children," he said.

The project faces several hurdles because of differing historical
views.

For example, some ancient documents cite the 21st century BC as the
origin of Chinese history. But the documents don't corroborate with
archaeological and scientific evidence.

Furthermore, some early 20th century accounts may have been distorted
by revolutionary views that often discounted traditional ideas. For
decades, individual historians clung to their own views and couldn't
agree on early history.

But Song is determined to sort it out.

"We can't go on saying that we have a 5,000-year-old history while
denying its existence," he said.

Similar efforts to substantiate history have been successful elsewhere
in the world, so Song believes his project is possible.

He developed the idea after a trip to Egypt two years ago, when he
visited an ancient papyrus mill and marveled at the Rosetta Stone,
which bears the decree of an Egyptian king in hieroglyphics. He was
impressed by the sophistication of Egyptian studies, the result of
concerted research by Egyptian and European scholars.

When Song returned to China, he sent his opinions to historians and
archaeologists and found that some of them agreed with him.

Among them was archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang. He responded that no
single scholar was capable of such a big project, but that it could
be accomplished through teamwork and strong leadership.

Too often, Chinese scholars have concentrated on an obscure area or
specific subject. While the practice produced endless details, it did
little to give a complete portrayal of Chinese history.

Song believed historians could apply the same methods used by
scientists who measure geological time. He suggested that historians
specializing in the same time periods should join together to discuss
divisions in that era. The results of their consensus would then be
published as a reference document, which could later be revised.

"It's like building a basic co-ordinate," Song said. "To ascertain a
king's rule ended in this year or the next has little significance,
but obvious events that reflect political or dynastic changes must be
in accord."

Most experts welcomed the idea, but a few have reservations. Song
believes that their different recommendations are valid, but that the
application of modern science must take precedence.

With the rise of modern astronomy, which can reconstruct ancient
celestial phenomena, and the use of advanced dating techniques, Song
believes the two fields should be combined to study history.

He also sees great potential in archaeological work. Unfortunately,
Chinese houses and tombs, made from earth and wood, often failed to
endure harsh weather and time.

Despite the project's intimidating scale, Song is confident.

"With more money flowing into field work and research, I believe it
will bear some result," he said.

Song also believes the project can help boost the nation's morale.

"Respect for our national culture is crucial to the country's
progress," he said. "In this respect, historians should be the first
to do their part."

China: Uncovering the start of history

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 9

MODERN archaeology has helped push back the earliest known dates in
Chinese history at least 1,000 years by authenticating the existence
of the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC) through the discoveries
of its capitals below modern Zhengzhou and Anyang.

Will archaeologists create history again in a huge chronology project?

Archaeologist Li Boqian, one of the leading experts working on the
project, believes the evidence points to an even earlier starting
point for Chinese civilization, but says that this will be hard to
prove.

Before modern archaeology was introduced to China, historians based
their theories on such ancient books as "Records of the Historian"
written by Sima Qian and "the Bamboo Annal." These texts suggest
Chinese history begins with a dynasty called Xia, which dates back to
the 21st century BC.

But here lies the snag: there is no evidence of this ancient kingdom.

If Xia ever had a written language, no traces of it have been found.
Virtually everything that scholars know about them is based on the
ancient books.

It is therefore not surprising that while experts have plenty of
theories about the origins of the Xia, few are universally accepted.

From early this century, a group of scholars began to attack the
authenticity of these written records, dismissing them as mere
legends. Some even regard the investigation of the dynasty as a waste
of time.

As this view gradually came to prevail, the more cautious experts have
pushed back their estimates of the beginning of China's social
history by more than 1,000 years.

Then, in the early part of this century, the increasing use of
archaeological techniques located the Shang capital in Anyang in
Central China's Henan Province. This proved that what the books say
about this dynasty is largely true. Pictograms inscribed on cattle
bones and tortoise shells found in Anyang provide firmer proof.

The discovery once again raised hopes in the minds of some historians
that the account of the Xia given by the "Records of the Historian"
may also have some truth in it.

Artifacts and images have been found which are sufficiently older, and
markedly different from those of later civilization. For instance,
the earliest Chinese cooking utensils were jars or ding -- cooking
vessels with two loop handles and three legs. Shang people used li
(cooking tripods with hollow legs) and yan (steamers with a bowl-like
upper part and a ding-tripod lower part).

These objects came from a series of ancient sites found since the
1950s. Known as the Erlitou sites, they are scattered across central
and western Henan and northwest Shanxi, on the fertile plains
overlooking the Luohe River and Yihe River -- exactly where the Xia
people lived according to the old books. Carbon-14 techniques date
the Erlitou culture as existing between the 21st century BC and the
17th century BC.

Two large excavations in the '60s and '70s resulted in the discovery
of a palace foundation.

A rammed earth base, 80 centimetres thick, and remains of walls and a
colonnade have been identified. The whole structure and layout
prefigures the structure of later Chinese palaces. The scale and
complexity of the engineering would demand a large group of people
under rulers able to direct the labour project -- probably a state.

"Understanding the Erlitou culture is the key to the chronology of the
Xia," said Li Boqian. "Most experts now tend to believe Erlitou
culture belongs to the late Xia Dynasty."

Li said that even if the Xia language has not been unearthed, there
are other elements that might well prove the existence of the Xia
Dynasty. Archaeologists will take samples from the different stages
of the Erlitou excavation and compare them with samples from the same
time-band elsewhere.

"The results may not be final, but they are certain to be more
unanimous," said Li.

The beginning of the Xia kingdom -- if it existed -- is even more
elusive than its end. Some scholars believe it shows affinity with
the older neolithic Longshan culture, a culture characterized by
black pottery dating between 3000-2000 BC.

Archaeologists have found Longshan household objects, such as pottery
wine cups and a kitchen range buried in big tombs and walled cities.

Longshan rulers turned to priest-advisers for predictions on
government matters and the outcome of hunts and battles. The priests
applied red-hot rods to the bones of cattle until they cracked, then
interpreted the cracks as auguries from the spirits.

Some of the symbols found on the pottery have caused argument among
scholars. Some believe they are artistic designs, others take them as
early pictograms.

"They are not decorative designs, for sure," said Li. "It's only that
there are not enough of them for us to decipher them and understand
their meaning."

Another fact may help to pinpoint the early Xia. Historical records
have it that the third king of the Xia, Zhong Kang, was once unseated
from the throne by a leader called Hou Yi from Shandong in East
China. Archaeologists believe that this important political event
would certainly leave its traces. If any evidence of the invasion
from the east can be unearthed, it will help sketch the early period
of the Xia.

Much will depend on co-operation across academic disciplines. For
example, a solar eclipse was said to have occurred during the reign
of Zhong Kang. If astronomers could give comparable dates, it would
assist the archaeologists.

Compared with the Xia, archaeological discoveries about the Shang are
a lot richer. More than 10,000 tombs have been found so far.

Originally, the Shang kingdom was thought to extend over the wide
plain formed by the Yellow River. They seemed to be militarily strong
and to have a cruel caste hierarchy. Their bronzework shows they were
highly artistic.

But discoveries in recent decades may rewrite the features of the
Shang. The sites in East China's Jiangxi Province and Southwest
China's Sichuan Province are especially fascinating for
archaeologists. The artifacts unearthed there demonstrate the
sophisticated level Shang society had attained. The influence of
Shang culture may have extended as far as Viet Nam.

"These archaeological finds really make us reassess the level of the
social development the Shang reached," said Li Xueqin, director of
the History Department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

At the heart of the attempt to untangle the chronology of the Xia,
Shang and Zhou dynasties is the uncertainty about when the Shang
ended. It is known that the Zhou King Wu annexed the lands of the
last king of Shang and extended his own dominion. There are currently
about 30 different opinions about when this happened.

Li Boqian said the question will be solved largely through the joint
efforts of astronomers, historians and scientists. In fact, the whole
project depends upon co-operation between scientists, he said.

Council are determined to keep every Chinese adequately provided with
food and clothing by the end of this century.

"This target is unchangeable," Jiang Zemin, general secretary of CPC,
pledged yesterday at a national conference on poverty alleviation.

Premier Li Peng told conference participants that the country's poor
areas should list poverty relief high on their economic development
plan, and assign the task of providing enough food and clothes to the
masses as the first priority.

Presiding over yesterday's conference was Zhu Rongji, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and the vice-premier of the State Council.

Participants included high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Hu
Jintao, Ding Guangen, Wu Bangguo, Zou Jiahua, Jiang Chunyun and major
cadres from the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

The CPC Central Committee and the State Council called upon the Party
to unite and mobilize all Chinese people to work for the common goal
in eliminating poverty in this country, Jiang declared.

From 1978 to 1995, China successfully reduced the country's
poverty-stricken population from 250 million to 65 million.

However, Jiang said, the task remains arduous and time is pressing for
realizing the goal of providing food and clothing for all poor people
in China by the year 2000.

"The CPC Central Committee is determined to win the hard battle,"
Jiang said.

Speeding up the development of poverty-stricken regions is not only an
economic issue, but also an issue concerning sustained national
stability, Jiang pointed out.

He said that with hard work, the goal can be achieved, because the
Party and the government pay paramount attention to poverty
alleviation and have adopted a series of major policies.

He suggested that a combination of State support and the development
of local resources is the basic solution for overcoming poverty.

He urged people in the poverty-stricken areas to pay more attention to
grain production, and to take advantage of local resources to develop
diversified operations that would increase the income of farmers.

Jiang also called for greater efforts to mobilize resources of the
whole society in the move to wipe out poverty.

China: Jiang hails relations with Kiribati

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 1

ALL countries of the world, regardless of size, should enjoy equal
political status, President Jiang Zemin said yesterday, when he met
with his Kiribati counterpart.

Every member of the world community is entitled to participate equally
in world affairs, Jiang told President Teburoro Tito of the island
country in the southern Pacific Ocean .

He met formally with Tito after an afternoon welcoming ceremony for
the six-member Kiribati delegation.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1986, the countries
have co-operated in trade, health care, science and technology and
culture, Jiang said, and they have yielded satisfactory results and
shown good development trends.

The two countries have also been understanding, supporting each other
in world affairs, he added.

Jiang said that both China and Kiribati are developing countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, have suffered from foreign invasions in the
past and are faced with the common task of developing national
economy.

Therefore, there is no conflict of interest between the two. Good
Sino-Kiribati relations will benefit not only both peoples, but also
Asia-Pacific stability.

China is willing to boost bilateral relations to a higher level on the
basis of mutual respect, friendly trust, and mutual benefit, the
Chinese president said.

Tito, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday for an eight-day State visit to
China, thanked Jiang for his invitation, saying he is happy to visit
China.

Kiribati cherishes its friendship with China, Tito said. He thanked
China for the unselfish aid to his country, which has a population of
80,000, has received in the past decade.

Kiribati hopes that China, as a big country, will continue to play a
significant role in the world, safeguarding peace, equal co-existence
and the common development of all countries, the guest said.

After the meeting, the two presidents attended the signing of a
bilateral economic agreement.

Kiribati is a major exporter of tuna fish.

China: Environment key to sustaining economic progress

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

SHANGHAI -- Environmental protection is "the key for China to sustain
economic development," the country's strategic task, State Councillor
Song Jian affirmed yesterday.

Song made his remarks at the fifth meeting of the China Council for
International Co-operation on Environment and Development (CCICED).
The meeting began in Shanghai yesterday and ends tomorrow.

In his report to the conference on China's environmental protection
and economic growth, Song said the State Council has asked government
officials at all levels, and all large enterprises, to increase their
efforts to protect the environment.

Though much progress has been made in environment protection, the
overall situation in China is still grave, Song said. Environmental
pollution, which began in urban areas, is spreading into rural areas.
In some areas, pollution is hampering economic development and even
posing a direct threat to people's health.

To combat pollution and improve the environment, Song said efforts
should be focused in seven areas:

o Policy-making by the central government and the legislative work
needed to draft stricter environmental laws and regulations;

o Increasing investment to finance environment projects through all
possible channels;

o Protection of ecosystems and controls over the exploitation of
natural resources;

o More research and development;

o Publicity campaigns to make people more conscious of the
environment;

o More international co-operation and exchanges to make China a key
participant in international environmental programmes;

o Development of China's environmental-protection industries.

During the Eighth Five Year Plan (1991-95), many old factories that
were high energy consumers and had caused serious pollution were
moved out of urban areas. Several important environmental programmes
were also completed in that period.

For each 10,000 yuan ($1,200) worth of gross domestic product value,
the average energy consumed has been reduced from the equivalent of
5.3 tons of coal to 3.94 tons.

The sewage-treatment rate was improved from 32 per cent to 76 per cent
among industrial enterprises above the county level.

Hygiene and sanitation in urban areas were improved, and the national
forest-coverage rate was raised from 12 per cent in 1980 to the
present 13.92 per cent.

China: Ministry calls for efficiency in heating

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

WITH the growing threat of increasing energy consumption by building
projects, mainly in home heating and air conditioning, the Ministry
of Construction is encouraging the erection of energy conserving
housing and the introduction of new technology and products to ease
the problem.

The issue has become more urgent as 5.5 billion square metres of new
housing will be built in the country by the end of the century, while
the 29.7 billion square metres of housing projects that already exist
are consuming increasing amount of energy.

Home heating in winter in the north and air conditioning in summer in
the south have become major energy consumers, Minister of
Construction Hou Jie told the opening of a national working
conference in Beijing yesterday.

Despite the fact that warm housing is far from adequate in northern
China in winter, Hou said, the amount of coal burned for warmth last
year exceeded 127 million tons, or 10.7 per cent of the national
total energy consumption.

The rate is as high as 20-50 per cent in some extremely cold places,
Hou said.

In hot southern areas, 25-40 per cent of urban residents have air
conditioners in their houses, which contributes to the shortage of
electricity in those places.

Hou attributed the problem to old buildings and a growing number of
new construction projects.

Energy consumption does not take into account illumination and the hot
water supply yet.

He urged improvements to buildings to make sure they were warm in
winter and cool in summer while saving energy.

According to Vice-Minister of Construction Ye Rutang, the ministry
plans to build more energy-saving housing projects nationwide.
Experiments have been conducted in eight cities in northern China,
where home heating systems are widely used, he said.

Ye said that the ministry hopes that by the year 2000 the energy
consumption rate of newly-built urban housing projects with heating
systems will drop by 50 per cent, as compared with the standard in
the early 1980s.

During the State's Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), Ye said his
ministry will focus on spreading new technologies and products such
as new thermal insulation building materials for walls and ceilings,
heat conserving windows, a concentrated heat supply system and solar
energy.

China: Highway vices curtailed

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A SENIOR government official announced yesterday that efforts to
standardize the country's highway transport system during the past
two years have been "effective."

Guo Rubin, an official of the State Council, said at a press
conference that the highways in 13 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have been cleared of the so-called "three vices."

The three vices -- imposition of arbitrary service charges, collection
of illicit fees and installation of random checkpoints -- have been a
problem on most highways in many regions during recent years.

These problems have been controlled on national and provincial
highways in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hainan, Tibet and
Ningxia, said Guo.

Earlier last year, the ministries of communications and public
security and Guo's office co-sponsored a national drive to crack down
on the three vices.

Statistics from 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
suggest that 7,298 illegal checkpoints were removed between January
1995 and the end of last month.

The cases of illicit collection of fees and imposition of arbitrary
service charges have also been reduced sharply thanks to the
crackdown, said Guo.

This year alone, 2,264 cases of such problems have already been dealt
with and 2,697 people have been punished.

China: Children's book fair to be held in Beijing

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 2

A NATIONAL fair for children's publications will be at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall starting on October 2. More than 20,000 titles of
children's books, newspapers and periodicals will be displayed and
sold during the four-day event.

Organized by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and the State Press and Publication
Administration, the fair will highlight the country's achievements in
children's publication work over the past several years and help
promote its development, said Yu Youxian, administrator of the
national press and publications.

Children's publishing houses from across the country will bring their
showcase books, audio and video cassettes and other electronic
products to the exhibition.

To enable young readers to afford the publications, a book sale will
be held at the Beijing Exhibition Hall on October 6, and will last
for three days.

The China Puppet Troupe, the China Leather-silhouette Troupe and the
Beijing Milky-Way Teenager Chorus will perform at the Beijing
Exhibition Hall during the children's publication fair as a special
welcome for the young visitors.

Twenty-one publishing houses will also donate some of their books to
children in remote and poor rural areas.

According to exhibition organizers, the country has established 29
publishing houses for children, which have published about 4,000 book
titles.

About 950 titles have been translated into 14 languages and exported
to more than 110 countries and regions around the world.

Since the first children's periodical was published in Beijing in
1930, 25 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have
created over a hundred such periodicals in many minority languages,
suitable for age groups below 18..

China: Poor girls get school aid

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

KUNMING, Yunnan Province -- As the upcoming semester approached,
13-year-old Guo Jiachu became more and more distraught. Her family
had sold its only pig to pay for her tuition after she was accepted
to the local middle school.

Guo, born in a small village by Lugu Lake on the border of Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces, was worried that she might not have tuition for the
next semester.

But thanks to the members of the Association of Businesswomen of the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ABACFIC), Guo will
receive 300 yuan ($36) a year for books, tuition and meals.

"Now I can keep my mind on my studies," Guo said with tears in her
eyes.

Guo is among 20 girls at the Luguhu Middle School who received
donations from the businesswomen's group. The entrepreneurs visited
the region from September 15 to 20 to investigate the status of local
education and the economy.

The programme is part of the Spring Bud Plan, which helps poor rural
girls finish their primary education, especially in poverty-stricken
areas.

"Poor education, transportation and communication are the main
problems that hinder economic development in these areas," said Annie
S. C. Wu, head of the group and Vice-chairwoman of the ABACFIC.
"Local people need more help from all circles, including the
businesswomen of non-State firms."

ABACFIC donated 300,000 yuan ($36,150) to establish a professional
skills school in Sichuan Province's Luguhu Town and in Yunnan
Province's Lijing prefecture.

"All the members of the ABACFIC understand that educating a girl means
educating a future mother, which is extremely crucial for improving
the quality of the next generation," Wu said.

In the last five years, the Spring Bud Plan has aided more than
100,000 girls in 28 provinces and autonomous regions, according to
official statistics.

Last year, the programme received 3.7 million yuan ($430,000) in cash
donations and 5 million yuan ($600,000) in goods.

Students like Guo may not be able to repay their benefactors in cash,
but they will reap huge returns through their successes.

Guo intends to study hard and go to a teachers college. Eventually,
she wants to teach people about her Mosuo culture, which retains
vestiges of a matriarchal society.

China: 38 die as Typhoon Willie wreaks havoc on Hainan

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 3

HAIKOU, Hainan Province -- At least 38 people are dead, scores are
injured and 96 are missing after Typhoon Willie violently swept over
most parts of Hainan, China's southern island province, over the
weekend.

Total damages and property losses due to Willie, the worst storm to
batter the semi-tropical island in 10 years, were believed very high
in many areas, although final reports are not available, local
authorities said.

Thousands of people were left stranded by floods due to Willie's heavy
rainfall, which flooded more than 100 villages along local rivers.

Locally stationed troops and relief forces have beefed up their
numbers to launch joint rescue operations.

Yesterday, it was reported evacuations of villagers from flooded areas
are continuing, with many awaiting rescue.

Damage reports so far indicate Hainan fared worse under Willie than
Xuwen Prefecture, the hardest-hit area in neighbouring Guangdong
Province, experts said.

In Hainan's Chengmai County, more than 400 millimetres of rain fell,
causing local rivers to overflow, flooding most parts of the town and
cutting off electricity, water supplies and transportation and
damaging many other facilities.

Six county residents were reported dead, rescue officials said, adding
more than 10,000 others stranded by flooding are now out of danger
thanks to rescue operations backed by armed forces troops.

In Hainan's Changjiang Li Autonomous County, 45 houses and 53 fishing
boats were washed away as floods weakened and breached parts of the
local breakwaters. As of yesterday, 30 people had drowned, and 96
remain missing.

In Qiongshan City, 26 villages along the Niandujiang River were
flooded and more than 38,300 hectares of farm land swamped. Some
crops were completely destroyed.

Over the past two days, more than 680 houses in the city collapsed and
over 3,100 houses were damaged either by floods or fierce winds
accompanying the typhoon, local officials said.

China: Japan must try to win trust of others

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE Japanese Government's tolerance of the landing by right-wingers on
the Diaoyu Islands indicates the regression of its policy towards
China, in some aspects, back to the days before the normalization of
bilateral relations, according to some observers in Beijing.

"Whether the Diaoyu Islands issue will be resolved amicably depends on
whether the Japanese Government adopts a wise attitude on the
territorial dispute," said Zhao Jieqi, deputy director of the
Japanese Studies Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The Japanese Government's abetment of the right-wingers' rampant
encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty has been deepening
mutual misunderstanding and is putting Sino-Japanese relations at
risk.

The explosion of the conflict on the Diaoyu Islands issue is not
sudden but is related to the changes in the macro-environment of the
international community and Japan itself, said Liu Jiangyong,
director of the Northeast Asia Division of the China Institute of
Contemporary International Relations.

Since the end of the Cold War, Sino-Japanese relations have been
facing many challenges.

The disappearance of the "Soviet threat" undermined the basis of the
Japan-US military alliance. Japan had to find an excuse to justify
the presence of the US troops in Japan.

Thus in the early 1990s, the "China menace theory" began to emerge in
Japan and was deliberately spread by some Japanese, including
prominent politicians.

Also with its growing economic clout, Japan began to seek political
and military status commensurate with its economic strength.

Some Japanese government officials not only denied the crimes
committed in World War II by their militarists but also encouraged
the government to put pressure on other countries, using loans and
sanctions as weapons.

This strategy is a divergence from Japan's previous approach of
helping war-afflicted countries develop their economies as some sort
of compensation.

Relying on its financial power, Japan is now taking a less restrained
and discreet attitude towards its war crimes and other sensitive
issues. It is also boldly bypassing the restrictions set by its
Constitution and is strengthening its military forces.

Japan's military expenditure is the second largest in the world in
recent years.

Some Japanese politicians believe that the atonement for the history
of invasion will not only hurt "national pride" but also harm Japan's
image as a "power." Therefore, headed by prominent government
officials, some Japanese blatantly denied the existence of the
Nanjing Massacre, "comfort women" and even Japan's invasion of other
countries.

"A mood of reversion against China is growing among the misled
Japanese because China is constantly urging Japan to re-examine the
past mistakes," said Liu.

Last year, when the whole world commemorated the victory of the
anti-fascist war, Japan, as an initiator of World War II, passed an
indecent resolution against the theme of the anniversary.

In July, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the first Japanese Prime Minister to be
born after the war, paid homage to the Yasukuni Shrine where class-A
war criminals are enshrined, heavily hurting the feelings of other
Asian peoples.

So strong is the non-recognition of crime sentiment in Japan that
politicians or ordinary Japanese who try to reveal the truth of
Japan's history of invasion would become the targets of attacks,
according to Liu.

Thus some politicians who treasure Sino-Japanese relations and
understand the friendship is in line with the interests of both
peoples find it more and more difficult to reverse the dangerous
trend.

Recent Japanese right-wingers' aggressive provocations on the Chinese
Diaoyu Islands further reflect their ambitions in international
politics, military development and territorial expansion.

A few Japanese are reluctant to see China, once a weak and bullied
country in modern history, grow stronger.

"These right-wingers hope to see, and also actively make troubles in
Sino-Japanese relations in order to propel Japan to turn right. The
Diaoyu Islands gives them a stage to perform," Zhao pointed out.

Every country and its people is sensitive about territory. That the
Diaoyu Islands belong to China since ancient times can be proved by
plenty of historical papers and facts, including those from Japan.

Therefore Japanese right-wingers' rampant trampling on China's
sovereignty stirred great indignation of both domestic and overseas
Chinese.

Japanese government officials' claim of sovereignty over the Diaoyu
Islands and threatening to use force will not help resolve the
problem but will worsen the conflict and harm Sino-Japanese
relations, said Zhao.

As for the Japanese government officials' claims that the government
cannot interfere with the activities of its people on its own
territory, Zhao believed it is mere subterfuge.

"International relations which involve ties with other countries
cannot be resolved as domestic affairs," said Zhao.

The Japanese Government should show sincerity in resolving the Diaoyu
Islands issue and take effective measures to prohibit the provocative
acts of the right-wingers.

China and Japan should hold dialogues on this issue and reach
consensus at the highest level. The dispute can be shelved until a
solution acceptable to both sides is found, Liu suggested.

The two countries' common interests dictate that partial disputes
should be resolved rationally and should not harm overall relations.
Sino-Japanese relations are significant for the peace and prosperity
of East Asia. Both of them will find it tough to co-exist as enemies.

For Japan which is seeking an increasingly important role on the
international stage, the primary concern of its foreign policy should
be how to win the trust of neighbouring countries.

But the point is whether Japanese politicians know this clearly, said
Liu.

China: More State firms turn to high-tech

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

THE introduction of high-technology is considered a cure for economic
ills by more and more deficit-stricken enterprises.

Before the recent exhibition of China's high-technology achievements
in Liaoning, a province with a high concentration of State-owned
enterprises, there was widespread skepticism that there would be an
audience for the expo since most State-owned enterprises are busy
tackling problems like rising deficits.

On display are high-tech achievement of a State programme dubbed
"Project 863" because it was first advocated in March 1986 by a group
of scientists who suggested that the government put more efforts into
high-tech research and development.

Despite the low expectations of some people, the week-long exhibition
proved a big success, and hosted an average of 7,000-plus visitors
each day. Among the visitors were government officials, enterprise
managers, professors and even peasants.

The exposition was aimed at the revitalization of traditional
industries by means of introducing advanced and new technologies.

The exposition wound up with 309 contracts for technology transfer
valued at 3.29 billion yuan ($396.3 million).

This co-operation between "Project 863" and State enterprises in
Liaoning signals the advent of mutual support between technology and
economy during the process of transition from a planned economy to a
market one, and from an extensive economy to an intensive economy,
according to an article in the Economic Information Daily.

The darlings of the traditional planned economy, many State
enterprises in Liaoning were ill-prepared for reform aimed at making
China's economy more market-oriented. While some firms have survived
the trials of the market, many others are on the verge of bankruptcy.

Now that factory directors and managers have finally realized they can
no longer depend on government coffers, they are starting to accept
that introduction of advanced sciences, and high-technology can be
their economic saviour.

This explains why the exposition was so well received in Liaoning.

The example of the Shenyang Air-blower Factory related at the expo
convinced many local managers that high-technology is something they
can turn to.

A small factory several years ago, Shenyang Air-blower Factory has
become China's largest producer of compressors and blowers thanks to
the introduction of high-tech operations.

After visiting the exhibition, many factory and company officials said
they are keen on technological upgrading to shake off their problems.

The Liaoning provincial government has showed great interest in
high-tech projects.

Before the exhibition had even ended, the local government had struck
an agreement with the State Science and Technology Commission to
usher in a system of joint meetings to promote the application of the
research achievements of "Project 863" in Liaoning.

China: Time to counter negative views on China

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 4

"China Through My Eyes" is sponsored by the State Bureau of Foreign
Experts Affairs and China Daily. It features our foreign readers'
impressions, suggestions and criticisms regarding developments in
China. Contributions are welcome.

By Zhang Yanyan

AS an overseas Chinese, I cannot help feeling insulted and concerned
over the way Western journalists and politicians continuously try to
tarnish China's image.

They do not accept Chinese views which are rational and based on
traditional concepts of philosophy and righteousness, but want to
turn everything concerning Chinese affairs into nasty, negative
nothings.

US's policy towards China is one of sabotaging, bullying and
trouble-making. That is why the US tells China off and spreads bad
propaganda about the lack of human rights in China.

As an overseas Chinese well-read in history and literature, I have
deep sympathy for the Chinese people. There is much that is good and
deep in Chinese traditions and history to learn from and build upon
but also much that is bad and evil to analyze and reflect upon, so
that evil will not be repeated.

To realize the Chinese utopia, a dream of past generations, the
Chinese must stay united. China must have stability.

However, that is difficult, for the Western politicians and
journalists, as well as many naive Chinese, are hacking at it. The
West propagates the uncertainty of stability in the future because
they profit economically in all ways from a weak and unstable
country. Some Chinese regard this to be a fact and unwittingly echo
the damaging intent in their naivety. This is certainly not good for
the Chinese people and for business. That would be like playing into
the enemy's trap.

The Chinese Government should be strong and knowledgeable about how to
strengthen the stability and security of China in all areas of life
and politics. There should be an intelligent body of scholars,
administrators, scientists, soldiers, journalists, professionals and
representatives of the districts and villages including overseas
Chinese and business people.

There are strong grounds in traditional, revolutionary and
post-revolutionary Chinese history, culture and politics to signal
the important contribution China can make towards universal peace and
advancements in all areas of human civilization. This is the only
truly political message that everyone, East and West, will accept and
cherish.

There are many good people and good things in the West and there are
many Western intellectuals who have loved, supported and hoped with
China and for China. Let China live up the best of everyone's
expectations. China will also need the continuation of her past
ideologies and excellent organization that once established a
crime-free, honest, supportive and universal humanitarian society as
in the 1950s.

I believe China should and can expand its influence in peaceful,
useful and intelligent ways for the benefit of its own people as well
as human kind. In China, there must be a good, strong and confident
government open to the views of the Chinese, Western and others whose
role is to ensure peace and unity and the security of all Chinese,
and everyone else in China.

China should have good, strong and effective defence featuring the
latest technological innovations. (This is to ensure that China will
not be bullied by aggressors.)

However, the most universal of human ideals -- happiness, peace and a
good quality of life -- should be the priority in all Chinese
affairs. China should work more intelligently to make and cultivate
friendships with the developed and less developed nations of the
world.

China: Agreement focuses on electrical insulators

from CHINA DAILY, September 24, 1996, page 5

A CONTRACT for establishing a $25 million tripartite joint venture was
signed yesterday in Beijing by Chinese and Japanese companies.

The NGK Insulators Tangshan Co Ltd will be jointly invested by the
Tangshan High Voltage Insulator Works in Hebei Province, and by NGK
Insulators Ltd and Itochu Corp of Japan.

The Chinese side holds only a 5 per cent stake in the investment,
while NGK controls 76 per cent. The remaining 19 per cent is held by
Itochu.

The joint venture, scheduled to start production in 1998, will have an
annual production output of 1.8 million units of suspension
insulators used for electrical transmission lines.

The venture will employ 400 people and is projecting annual sales
income of $30 million by 1999.

Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, encouraged the Japanese investors during a
meeting before the signing of the contract, saying that development
of the power industry in China will have a bright future.

Hebei Provincial Governor Ye Liansong told the Japanese investors that
in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the power industry will be
the key sector of development in the coastal province.

In the coming five years, Hebei plans to meet growing power demand by
constructing plants with a total electricity generating capacity of 6
million kilowatts.

The country as a whole will increase its electricity generating
capacity by an estimated 80 million kilowatts during the period, Ye
said.

Ye said these trends augur well for the joint venture, whose products
are widely used by power plants and electricity transmission lines.

Products of the joint venture will eventually be exported to the
international market, according to Mike Shibata, president and chief
executive officer of NGK Insulators.

Itochu Corp, one of the largest Japanese trading companies, is the
first Japanese company to open a representative office in China after
1949. Last year, its trade volume with China reached about $5.5
billion.

In addition to trade, Itochu has also been active in committing
investment in the Chinese market.

So far, it has established about 150 joint ventures on the Chinese
mainland, involving textiles, food, metals and machinery.

Itochu says it plans to establish more joint ventures in the coming
years as more than 100 new projects are under negotiation with
Chinese partners.

The End of the "Flying Peace"

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Zhang Shuangwu

Recently, a lovely project at the Guangxi Nanning Zoo vanished like
a soap bubble.  In October 1995, in order to create a "new scenic
spot," the zoo invested 15,000 RMB to introduce 850 chick doves
into the zoo from other places.  After two months of meticulous
nurturing and taming, the full-grown white doves were released into
the zoo's green trees and tender lawns to sport freely with the
visitors.  The white doves, green lawn, and blue sky became a major
attraction at the Nanning Zoo.

However, during the time they were allowed to fly free every day,
quite a number of the doves were injured when they were chased by
the visitors.  The worst was that some visitors even stole the
white doves when the zoo keepers were not around.  Once, over one
hundred white doves were stolen in a single day!

The deputy director of the zoo, Zhang Caichang, was forced to
remark: "In fact, one white dove is not worth that much, at the
most 10 RMB.  I assume that the visitors who stole the doves were
not going to sell them for money, but rather to make a side dish
for their drinks."  The public security police of the zoo noticed
that in early July this situation had become worse.  The reason was
that during the summer vacation, the number of children visiting
the zoo had increased; with their parents' tacit permission as well
as connivance, some young visitors repeatedly broke the rules.

According to the count, among the 850 white doves which were first
introduced into the Nanning Zoo, besides the 200 that suffered from
natural deaths, another 500 doves were stolen by visitors.
Starting from August 20, the zoo decided to lock the 130 surviving
doves into a specially built and well-sealed wooden house.  The
project of releasing the "Flying Peace" thus came to a premature
end.

In the Nanning Zoo, the white doves are not the only animals to
have suffered such misfortunes. Sea lions, tigers, and red-crowned
cranes are sometimes injured or blinded by visitors.  The medical
bill of the zoo to protect these animals is increasing every year.

The Water Shortage in Xi'an

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Bai Lin & Gao Xiaoyan

Right after the Spring Festival this year, residents in some areas
of Xi'an city began the torment of waiting for the water to be
turned on.  As soon as they received a notice that their water was
being turned on they bustled around to fill containers of all sizes
that they could find in their homes.  They finally became used to
using water this way.  On one occasion, in the summer of last year,
water was the most rare life-sustaining source for people in Xi'an.
Water storage jugs, which cost 35 RMB, were one of the hottest
consumer goods.  Water traffickers also took advantage of the
situation to profiteer.  Even the officials who never had a need to
worry about food would not forget to carry two water buckets in the
trunks of their cars.

Water is threatening the survival of this ancient city.  The
excessive extraction of underground water has already produced
serious consequences: across the city, a total length of 55
kilometers, 13 ground fissures from east to west have destroyed
several thousand houses; the famous cultural relic, the Big Goose
Pagoda, now tilts soberly; and the deterioration of the earth's
surface at the Clock Tower and at three other historic sites has
been exacerbated.

The daily extractable ground water in Xi'an city is 120,000 to
140,000 tons at the most, but this only meets one-third of the
required demand of the city.  So by the time 260,000 tons are
extracted daily, the water level has dropped dramatically.  The
water level is now dropping between two and three meters annually
in the metropolitan area and between three and five meters in the
southern suburbs.  This overextraction has produced a series of
other problems.  First, as the water quality deteriorates, the
shallow water can no longer be used for human consumption because
of the discharge of industrial waste and because of the excessive
use of agricultural pesticides and chemical fertilizers.  Second,
the earth has begun to subside seriously.  From 1986 to 1991, the
earth in the metropolitan area subsided from 30 millimeters to 210
millimeters, and the annual rate increased from 10 millimeters to
70 millimeters.

The drop in the level of the ground water and the deterioration of
the water quality greatly raised the costs of water extraction and
purification for the city water company.  Currently The cost for
water purification has reached 0.47 RMB per cubic meter, while the
water company can only charge city residents 0.45 RMB per cubic
meter of water.  Whereas the 2.3 hundred million cubic meters of
the the total annual natural water supply cannot be changed, the
water supply enterprises are pinched to their limit.

Xi'an was called "Chang'an" in ancient times.  Our forefathers
often described the beauty of this ancient city as "Eight Rivers
Surrounding Chang'an."  But today, of the eight rivers which used
to encircle Xi'an, some have long ago been cut off, and some can
only barely be called "rivers" during the rainy seasons.  Today,
only the Feng River is still flowing year round, but because the
weather has been continuously dry, the water source of the Feng
River has also dropped two meters.  In addition, Chang'an county,
through which the Feng River flows, has built a simply-constructed
dam at the river's upper stream for its own benefit.  This five
million RMB dam pushed the Xi'an water company, which had invested
several dozen million RMB, into a tight corner; even with forty
deep wells, the quantity of water this company could produce
dropped sharply.

In general, when the water supply is insufficient, it is natural to
ration it.  But the Water-Ration Office is plagued by numerous
difficulties.  The same people who sometimes do not have enough
drinking water still do not have a conscience about saving water.
The Water-Ration Office manages 300 work units with self-contained
wells, and supplies 1400 planned water customers each with over 20
cubic meters for daily usage.  Every year, the office readjusts the
water usage quota, and water meters are checked monthly.  The
charge for overquota water is two to six times the normal price.
The Water-Ration Office also sets a quota for water usage for water
for daily living; residents who get water from outdoors receive a
daily quota of 50 liters per person; those have indoor hygiene
facilities receive 120 liters per person; people have bath or
shower facilities get 150 liters per person; students boarding at
colleges get 220 liters (including for the use of labs); grade
school and high school students get 80 liters (also including that
for lab use).  However, because of the lack of funds and the lack
of water supply engineering and due to the unfinished
reconstruction of the old urban pipeline, there is still a gap in
terms of managing water usage in residential areas.  Furthermore,
ground water management within the city is chaotic, as some
departments arbitrarily give permission to dig wells.

With the number of water consumers increasing constantly, the water
supply in Xi'an is becoming more and more short every year.  When
summer comes, it is almost as if eyebrows are about to catch fire.
The peak water supply has become a serious social problem.  In
1991, when there were forty days of summer drought, the daily
difference between the need and the supply of water exceeded 0.4
million cubic meters.  This directly affected the everyday life of
500,000 people living on 20 square kilometers;  202 enterprises
were also affected, and it was estimated that they incurred 42.5
hundred million RMB in losses in industrial output that year.

On July 15, 1991, the city government issued five emergency
policies to deal with the shortage of the water supply: limit daily
use per person to 100 liters; put an end to waste due to running
water, leakage, dripping, and overflowing; ban garden watering and
cooling off with tap water; close down all the city swimming pools
which use tap-water; reduce by 20 percent the supply to customers
using large quantities of water.  By 1995, the condition had
worsened, and Xi'an was inescapably caught in a water crisis.

The daily demand for water in Xi'an is 1.2 to 1.25 million cubic
meters, but now only 0.75 million cubic meters of water can be
supplied.  This shortage of water is 43 percent of the water
supplied.  Now, people are placing their hopes on the Black River
that originates in the Qin mountains.  But until the water from the
Black River can get to Xi'an, there is no way to solve the water
shortage problem.  The total investment in the Black River
diversion work requires 2900 million RMB; although 1000 million RMB
has already been spent, the work has not been finished.

In fact. there are many other cities with water shortages more
serious than Xi'an.  Taiyuan is one such city, but without any
practical scenario to solve the problem, some people have
tentatively suggested relocating the city.  The capital of Beijing
is also short of water, as the average water supply per capita in
Beijing is only 1/30 of the world's average. By the year 2010, the
gap between supply and demand will be over 1000 million cubic
meters.

Leaking Housing Projects

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Many new housing projects have been built as China's economy has
developed.  But the quality of the houses has become lower and
lower.  According to a survey conducted by the "China Technical and
Development Center of the Building Industry," in the twenty-two
cities surveyed, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., 53
percent of the houses leaked in the very first year after
completion.  According to the official Xinhua News Agency, in the
1950s, leaking began after an average of sixteen years after
completion; in the 1960s, leaking occured after seven to nine
years; in the 1970s, after three to five years.

Due to the poor quality of the housing projects, a great amount of
money has been spent on repairs.  In the survey of the twenty-two
cities, it was estimated that the money spent on repairs in one
year exceeded the original budget by 1.2 billion RMB.

New Party Members

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Recently, to the elation of Party officials, there has been a new
upsurge in the number of students applying to join the Communist
Party.  But, on closer scrutiny, it was found that the motives
behind the applications were of a dubious nature.

According to a survey, 30 percent of those answering the question
regarding their motives for joining the Party answered that if one
is a Party member he/she is more likely to find a good job.  When
asked whether it is right to say that Party membership is an
important chip in the competition for good jobs after graduation,
70.1 percent answered that this was reasonable.  When they were
asked what they would do when their personal interests clashed with
the interests of the Party, 53.7 percent answered that they would
do their best to consider the interests of the Party, but their
personal interests would also have to be taken into consideration.

A Free Ride

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Jin Hua, an old lady, recently died of cancer in Ji'nan Central
Hospital.  Fortunately, she was a veteran of the Anti-Japanese War
and all her medical bills could be paid by the state; the bill was
given to her daughter to be transferred to Jin Hua's work unit.

Because her daughter is a very methodical person, she checked the
bill over and found that there were many items on the bill that her
mother had not received.  For instance, her mother was allergic to
antibiotics, but she was charged for more than 200 penicillin
shots; her mother's gallbladder had been removed many years
earlier, but one of the drugs listed on the bill was to treat
gallstones.  During Jin Hua's stay in the hospital, she had four
electrocardiograms, but she was charged for eight; she had not had
any blood transfusions, but 640 RMB was charged for blood
transfusions.  Charges for even more expensive medicine to treat
obesity appeared on the bill.  Later it was found out that some of
the doctors and nurses had included on the bill some medicine which
they themselves needed.  They reasoned that since the bill was to
be paid by the state, then why not get a free ride?

A New Wave of Persecution Against Catholics

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

There are many Catholics in the Baoding region of Hebei province.
Donglu village is one of the most densely congregated areas.  In
the name of "helping to improve the economy," the authorities sent
in a work team of over one hundred cadres at the beginning of this
year and launched a new wave of persecution against the Catholics.
The villagers were forbidden from leaving the village without
permission from the authorities.  Priests were arrested and
worshipping was banned; Catholic students were suspended from
school unless they denounced their religion, nuns were forced to
participate in "pre-nuptial training courses" where "sexual
education" was conducted in a lewd manner. The 38th Field Army of
over 2,000 soldiers surrounded the village to intimidate the
villagers.

Such persecution has also occurred in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian,
and Shaanxi provinces, as well as in other parts of Hebei province.

Bitter Fruit of the One-Child Policy

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Two incidents have become hot topics of conversation among
educators and parents in China.

The first incident concerns ten children from the city of Harbin
chosen to participate in a summer camp in Russia.  These ten were
chosen from over 100,000 Harbin children, and were supposed to be
"outstanding students," but they also turned out to be very finicky
and pampered.  Once when the children were playing volleyball, the
ball rolled into a swimming pool.  The Russian children immediately
jumped into the pool to retrieve it, but the Chinese children stood
there crying "What's to be done?"  When mountain climbing, the
Russian children rushed up the mountain shouting joyously, while
the Chinese children formed a line, climbed slowly and listlessly.
When the time came for the children to depart, the gifts the
Russian children gave to their Chinese friends were all hand-made,
while the gifts from the Chinese children were all store-bought,
conventional presents.

Another incident concerns the freshmen enrolling at Peking
University.  On the day of enrollment, the number of parents
accompanying their sons and daughters far exceeded the number of
students.  Some parents even planned to stay near the college for
two weeks after enrollment to teach their children how to wash
their own clothes and how to take care of themselves.  Nearly all
the students were only children and had led very sheltered and
pampered lives.

Many educators and parents are worried: what has the one-child
policy done to our next generation?

Spending 20,000 RMB to Win 4,800 RMB

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

An advertisement appeared in Wuhan announcing a guessing game
sweepstakes: telephone the number 9680-0001 and answer a question
about tourism; if the answer is correct, the caller will score a
point.  The person who accumulates the most points will receive the
first prize of 4,800 RMB. The second and third prizes were to be
1,800 RMB and 1,000 RMB respectively.

Finally the results of the sweepstakes were published: the first
prize winner had called 21,817 times, the second prize winner
14,614 times; all winners had called no less than 8,000 times.
People all knew that the minimum fee for calling an 968 number is 1
RMB, so why would anyone spend more than 20,000 RMB only to win
4,800 RMB?  Were they crazy?

No, their minds were perfectly sound.  The operator of the 968 line
explained that nearly all these calls were made using office
telephones.  The winners not only did not have to pay the phone
bills, but also they had not used their own time to participate in
the game.

Fake Medicine from the Red Cross

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

A "panacea" to cure cancer which was sold by the Red Cross of
Hainan Island turned out to be fake medicine which had endangered
the lives of many patients.

This "panacea" is actually powder of glossy ganoderma spore, which
does not possess such curative effects as advertised by the Hainan
Red Cross.  As early as December 1994, the Ministry of Public
Health had announced that this powder could not cure cancer, that
it should be prohibited from being sold as cancer medication, and
that those who did so should be fined.  But, as the old Chinese
saying goes, "The heaven is high above and the emperor is far
away"; Hainan Island, which is the farthest province from Beijing,
thought it did not have to obey orders from Beijing.  This
"panacea" continued to be sold in the compound of the provincial
public health department for 260 RMB per gram (the actual cost was
roughly 300 RMB per kilogram).  It was not until April 1996, when
victims of this fake medicine began to sue, that this fraud finally
came to a halt.

Letter From China: Adventure in a Small Township

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

Dear Brother:

I always remember the letter you wrote to me about your first visit
to 42nd Street in New York.  Now let me tell you something I
experienced in a small border town several days ago.

I went to Dongxing township at the border of Guangxi Autonomous
Region together with my boss and another colleague.  Having heard
that the public security there is not good, we decided that we
would stay in the same room just to be on the safe side.  But as
soon as we settled down and turned on the TV for the 7:OO PM news,
there was a knock on the door and in came a young girl asking to
use our telephone.  We didn't give this much thought and agreed.
She made a call and immediately another two girls arrived at our
room, one of whom was wearing very little clothing.  They sat down
on our beds and said: "You must be very tired, let us give you
massages."  We realized that these girls were prostitutes and our
boss said sternly: "Please leave!  We don't need any massages."
But they refused to budge until we threatened to report them to the
police.

Having learned a lesson, we locked our door, but there were still
repeated knocks.  One time our door was opened with a key and in
came a seductive woman carrying a teapot.  She said: "Aren't you
lonely in this small town without me?"  Despite her curses, we
managed to drive her out.  At ten o'clock, my boss and my colleague
went downstairs to arrange for our transportation for the next day.
As soon as they left, another girl came in and said: "You must have
been away from home for many days, don't you need female services?"
When I pushed her away, she cursed at me saying: "Are you afraid
that I'll rape you, you old scoundrel!"  During that one evening,
altogether there were five groups of prostitutes who knocked at our
door.

The following morning we went to the front desk and demanded to
know how the prostitute had obtained a key to our room.  The clerk
said: "She said that you wanted some drinking water. How could I
know she was a bad woman?  There are too many young girls here from
Sichuan and Heilongjiang - when they can't find jobs, they have to
sell themselves."

The Red and the Black

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Jin Dabai

While the Chinese Communist regime is trying its best to block the
way for democracy in China, the so-called "black gangs" (criminal
syndicates) have successfully penetrated into many mid-level and
grass-root institutions, sometimes even replacing the local
regimes.

As early as 1991, the Ministry of Public Security had exposed a
powerful black gang in Gaoyang county, Hebei province.  Though this
criminal syndicate had only some sixty members, the Ministry of
Public Security had to mobilize forces from Hebei, Heilongjiang,
Jilin, Shandong, Liaoning, Beijing, and Tianjin to crack it.  Why?
Because it had infiltrated into many government and Party
institutions.  Even after the syndicate was cracked, its remnants
still managed to seep into the judicial system, using different
hoaxes, to rescue three of its bosses, finally getting them out on
bail.

The black gangs are growing very rapidly, their power reaching
almost every stratum of the society.  In Nanjing, the capital city
of Jiangsu province, four criminal gangs have divided the city up
into four turfs.  They demand "protection fees" from the businesses
and residents within their turfs and help settle disputes among
residents as if they are government mediators.  Residents who
usually are afraid to go to public security departments or courts
of law prefer to deal with people from the black gangs.

Over the years, the black gangs have gradually wormed their way
into various institutions of the regime; by bribing officials they
have used legal means to obtain power.  With officials to back them
up, the gangsters can do whatever they wish.  Some gangsters are
even officials themselves.  In some provinces in the south, it was
found that quite a few of the local heads of the public security
departments are also black gang bosses.  This is why the Beijing
regime recently decided to rotate local public security heads.

Some officials who find it difficult to solve such problems as
debts, civil disputes, and problems of public order through
officials channels often resort to the black gangs to settle these
disputes and problems.  It is a common practice for managers to
hire gangsters to force debtors to pay up; if the debtor refused,
then he might have to pay with an ear, a hand, or even with his
life.  There is a fixed price-list in Shenzhen for carrying out
such "jobs": chopping off a hand, 8,000 RMB; a foot, 10,000 RMB;
for taking one's life, 30,000 RMB.  Recently the public security
department in Shenzhen arrested two members of a butcher ring.
They had been hired by Mr.Fan, the general manager of a
corporation, to "teach a lesson" to Mr. Wang, the manager of a taxi
company. Fan was willing to pay 30,000 RMB, but, afraid that he
might be caught and face a death sentence, he told the executioners
that he would be satisfied with their merely incapacitating Wang.
However, by mistake a taxi driver was beaten up and the case was
exposed.  When these two butchers confessed, they revealed
information about the price-list; they confessed that they had been
hired several times and that as soon as they were paid they would
go out and "do their job."

Both the officials and gangsters find such cooperation very useful:
the gangsters with official power in their hands become more
powerful; and corrupt officials with support from the black gangs
actually have an "army" at their beck and call.  In a township in
Hunan province, there is a tacit understanding between the local
government and the black gangs: the gangsters will collect
protection fees from the local markets and businesses; and whenever
the public security department wants help in cracking a case, the
black gangs will give assistance.  The township officials see
nothing wrong with this cooperation.  Such cooperation has
developed to such an extent that in some localities the black gangs
regard themselves as the regime itself.

The current trend among the black gangs is to buy out grass-root
Party and government cadres so that they have more valid
protection.  The black gangs in the countryside are making use of
the clans to rope the cadres or to bribe officials in grass-root
elections so that the black gangs bosses are elected to public
office.

The Two Chinas - In the Media and in Reality

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Chen Yen

In August, I went back to China to visit my family and to tour the
country.  In addition to brief stays in big cities like Beijing and
Xi'an, I also visited a number of inland counties and villages in
Sichuan and Hubei provinces.  I have to say that it was quite an
experience.  The most intense realization I had was that the China
that I saw with my own eyes is greatly different from the China
portrayed in various overseas media in Europe, America, Hong Kong,
and Taiwan.

I should say that there is another China that is real but that is
being ignored in the media.

The overseas media reports on China often cite numbers, but these
numbers are primarily from China's official statistics.  For
example, in July of this year China's official media made many
claims: the Chinese economy had successfully achieved a "soft
landing"; the growth rate of the economy for the first half of the
year remained at 13 percent, while inflation continued to decline
to an average of 7.8 percent; and 49 percent of the state-owned
enterprises were operating at a deficit.  Except for the latter
statistic, the above officially announced figures are all positive.
However, their accurateness is questionable.  Even the number of
state-owned enterprises operating at a deficit is quite different
in reality.

Among my observations in China, the first is that the condition of
agriculture is very bad.  This year flooding has been very serious
in the south and there was a bad harvest of the summer crops.
Disallowing for the flooded fields, the crops had rotted in 30 to
40 percent of the remaining fields.  In Sichuan, I ran into many
peasants who had fled from the floods in Hubei province.  They
reported that all the rice paddies and cotton fields in their home
areas were flooded.  The cotton problem was the worst.  The
Jianghan plain in Hubei province used to be a famous cotton-
producing area.  But this year the cotton plants grew only stems,
and there were no buds.  Therefore, there would be a diminished
output.

The agricultural depression directly affected the market because in
inland China, business in the middle-sized and small cities mainly
depends on the buying power of the peasants.  I witnessed a
depressed economic scene in a number of counties and cities in
northern Sichuan: all the department storesin these cities had a
surplus supply of goods.  But without even one exception, these
stores had almost no shoppers.  And few people were going to
restaurants.

When we visited a city in Hubei, we were told that 90 percent of
the state-owned enterprises were idle.  Some operated occasionally,
but they could not make a profit so that the workers had to go out
to find other sources to make a living.

The problems within the state-owned enterprises have already caused
serious social consequences.  In one city in Hubei province, I
witnessed 300 workers staging a sit-in in front of the municipal
government offices.  The city officials all had to use the side
doors of the building to avoid the protesters.  The deputy mayor
had originally planned to accompany us on a tour of the city, but
since his car could not exit from the gate, he had to give up the
tour.  The protesting workers came from a local power plant.  The
city had initially collected funds from the workers so that the
plant could generate electricity but the cost of producing the
electricity was higher than purchasing it elsewhere. So the city
government decided to close down this power plant.  However, the
remaining funds collected from the workers were gobbled up by the
officials of the plant.  Although two of the officials were
arrested for this wrongdoing, the whereabouts of the workers' fund,
not to mention also their salaries, had yet to be resolved.  The
municipal government did not know how to respond to the protest.
Privately, city officials thought the workers' protest was
justified; but even if the government temporarily were able to
issue the workers small subsidies, because of its tight budget it
would not be able to ameliorate the workers' resentment.  Such
incidents are common-place in China today, so city officials across
the country are now quite accustomed to such protests.

Although what I saw during this short trip to China naturally was
limited, it was enough to make me feel the seriousness of the
country's current problems.  When I chatted with local officials, I
was surprised that they so honestly told me that local governments
at various levels all survive by submitting fake reports.
Previously there was no income base for the finances of the local
governments because they relied on the higher levels of government;
now the local governments have to rely on extorting fees from the
masses.  For example, schools now commonly ask grade school and
high school students to pay high tuitions, which in turn are
deposited in the government's coffers. Local governments then boast
that their situation is excellent because their economic growth has
taken off at an amazing speed.

A friend of mine has a position in a local government.  He told me
that though the overall situation is very poor, temporarily the
people will be able to tolerate it.  The reasons are: first, people
have an increased degree of freedom and if their own work unit
cannot pay out wages, they can still find other outside income;
second, most people have become cynical as they know that this
system will not last for long.  As a result, he said, there are two
decisive consequences to the current circumstances and these will
have a far-reaching influence.

First, since the reform started over a decade go, the people's
democratic consciousness has increased a great deal.  This means
citizens everywhere, including people in remote areas, have all
started resorting to their legal rights to express their opinions.
Street protests are an often-used technique.

Second, the relationship between the cadres and the masses at the
basic levels has changed substantially; it is now antagonistic and
competitive.  The supportive base upon which the Chinese Communist
Party used to rely among the lower-level masses has already gone
with the wind.

An Event Fueling the Power Struggle

from CHINA FOCUS, Volume 4, Number 11, November 1, 1996

by Liu Zian

Recently, an important event, which undoubtedly will intensify the
power struggle within the party central, has been unfolding.

The beginning of this event was quite common place: earlier this
year, the position of the vice secretary of the Liuzhou Prefectural
Party Committee in Guangxi Autonomous Region was vacated.  Liu
Heping, deputy mayor of a city in that prefecture, went all out to
try to secure the position.  He used to say that he had served in
the army for thirteen years and because of his achievements he had
been promoted from a common soldier to the post of the deputy head
of a regiment.  But soon a competitor for the vacated position
exposed to the regional party committee that Liu had lied about his
personal history; instead of being in the army he had actually been
a criminal who had spent thirteen years in prison.  After an
investigation, this allegation was confirmed.

Just as Liu Heping was facing a hopeless impasse, suddenly two
officers from the headquarters of the General Staff in Beijing came
to the Guangxi Autonomous Region Party Committee; they claimed that
they were entrusted by the party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to
inform the committee that Liu Heping had spent the thirteen years
in prison "to carry out a special task."  As luck would have it, Hu
Jintao, a standing committee member of the Politburo, was in
Guangxi at that time.  When Hu heard about this, he was very much
in doubt; so he verified this piece of information with Jiang Zemin
himself.  Jiang flatly denied that he had sent out those officers
on such an errand and asked that this fraud be thoroughly
investigated.

It is obvious that whoever had sent those two officers faced great
political risks.  Unless the exposure of Liu Heping would have
brought him tremendous disaster, he certainly would not have
ventured to make such a dangerous move; and if he did not have
strong support, support from someone whose safety also depended
closely on the safety of Liu Heping, this person too would not have
taken such a risk.

Indeed, the case of Liu Heping exposed a huge criminal gang which
involved many high-level officers.  The person who had sent those
two officers to intercede on behalf of Liu Heping was in a high
enough position: he was Major General Liu Shilun, head of the
Management Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters.  This
Management Bureau is in charge of providing logistic services to
all the high officers, and Liu Shilun has broad and influential
connections both in the top echelons of the military and in the
localities.

Based on many cases of corruption which have already been exposed,
Liu Shilun had acted as the go-between for high military officers
and local officials in illegal business dealings.  Liu Shilun was
also guilty of another crime: using his authority he recruited many
pretty girls from the ranks of the female soldiers and sent them to
luxurious hotels established by the military and to military guest
houses in Beijing to provide sexual services to military and local
officials.

Up to the present, one lieutenant general, three major generals,
and tens of local officials have been arrested.  The highest-
ranking officials in Tianjin municipality and in Sichuan province
were also involved.

Corruption in the army has always been more severe than in the
localities, but such cases have always been carefully covered up.
The anti-corruption campaigns have never really reached into the
military and corruption cases in the military have never been
publicly exposed.  In recent years, Jiang Zemin has been especially
careful to avoid involving the military in the anti-corruption
campaigns.  At this time, as Jiang is wooing the military for
support in the intense struggle for power in the post-Deng era, any
exposure of military corruption cases will definitely put Jiang in
a difficult position.  With so many factions in the military, it
will be very easy for one faction to find some pretext to strike at
another; Jiang certainly does not wish to be caught in the middle.

It is said that the relationship between Liu Shilun and General
Zhang Wannian, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and
chief of the General Staff, is very close.  Zhang Wannian had
several times recommended Liu Shilun for the position of the vice
chief of the General Staff, but his proposal was vehemently
rejected by General Chi Haotian, another vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission and the minister of national defense.
The exposure of Liu Shilun has evidently put Zhang Wannian at a
disadvantage at a crucial moment when Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian
are both contending for membership on the standing committee of the
Politburo; at the same time, these two generals both carry
significant weight in support of Jiang Zemin in the scramble to
keep his position as the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party.  In view of the fact that Jiang Zemin has always favored
Zhang Wannian over Chi Haotian, the struggle that is now unfolding
surely will be intensely dramatic.

Local firms flood into Europe: 29 information technology companies hoping
to get closer to their clients

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Acer, Mitac and First International are among 29 major Taiwan information
technology (IT) firms that are currently building assembly plants or
expanding operations in Europe, industry experts said on Saturday.

 Jean Yves Yao, a section chief of the Chinese National Federation of
Industry (CNFI), said the ``companies want to be closer to their clients
so they can provide after-sales service.''

 Acer, the biggest local computer maker, began constructing an assembly
plant in Finland in late 1995 and may start operation next year. The
computer giant plans to use the Scandinavian country as a base for
marketing forays into Russia and other republics of the former Soviet
Union.

 It chose Finland because of its proximity and traditionally close
economic ties to Russia.

 Mitac next year will mark its tenth year of operations in Telford
Shropshire, the UK. It has invested about NT$68 million in a computer
peripherals plant in the industrial district.

 Mitac, Tatung, Lite-on and six other IT and electronics firms which have
made the UK their regional hub are benefiting from the longest average
working week in the European Union (EU) - 43.3 hours. They also enjoy
quick transport links to continental Europe through the English channel
tunnel, enabling them to deliver products to France and Germany in less
than two days.

 First International has an assembly plant in the Netherlands, which,
according to Yao, has the best transport system in Europe.

 ``Goods are brought to Rotterdam and then quickly shipped to users,''
said Yao.

 The Netherlands also boasts the lowest incidence of labor disputes in
Europe - it lost an average of only 13 working days per 1,000 employees
every year from 1991 to 1993. Greece, which has the worst labor record in
the EU, lost an average of 1,780 working days per 1,000 employees every
year in the same period.

 Joseph Chwo-ming Yu, a professor at the National Cheng Chi University,
said many IT firms are planning to expand operations in Europe as a hedge
against declining sales in other markets.

 For instance, Acer's sales last month, NT$3.642 billion, dipped 25
percent from the level in the same period last year. Mitac's sales
likewise dropped last month, by 18 percent to NT$912 million from the
figure in August 1995.

 According to Yu, about 34 percent of all local IT firms already serve the
European market. About the same number sell products to either North
America or China. Also, 24 of the 29 firms with big investment plans in
Europe now make over 60 percent of total sales in foreign markets.

Investment in Austria heading for early profit

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 VIENNA - Atomos Petrochemie, Taiwan's largest investment in Austria by
the Dahin Group, is going to celebrate its first anniversary on Sept. 30
with a silver lining on the horizon.

 Kevin Liu, president of Atomos Petrochemie, said on Saturday that he
believes the more than US$28-million investment project will prove
profitable in the first year.

 Dahin Group bought the petrochemical plant last year for US$28 million
from the state-run Chemie Linz. Atomos Petrochemie, located in the
Schwechat petrochemical industrial park near Vienna International Airport,
mainly produces PA (phthalic anhydride), an up-stream fossil material for
making plastics.

 Liu said since the plant began operation last September, its annual
output of chemical materials has increased from 38,000 metric tons to
42,000 metric tons and is expected to reach 45.000 metric tons within a
short period of time.

 Half of the plant's PA output is exported to Asian countries, while the
rest of it goes to Austria, Germany, France and Italy, Liu said.

 PA can be used to make a variety of products, ranging from nipples on
infants' milk bottles to medical gloves.

 Liu said that because of automated production lines, besides his wife and
himself, the plant hired only some 40 Austrian employees. While speaking
highly of the work force in Austria, Liu said the welfare system for the
employees sometimes was a headache in the factory management.

 Austria has proved to be conveniently located, allowing Atomos to acquire
raw materials from resource-rich countries such as the former Soviet
Union, the Netherlands, Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia, Liu said.

 On the future development of the petrochemical plant, Liu said that Dahin
Group decided to further invest five or six million US dollars to install
a co-generation facility in the plant. After the completion of the
facility by the end of next year, the next step is to set up down-stream
factories to be in line with its current Austrian production base, Liu
said.

 Dahin is one of the largest petrochemical intermediary producers in
Taiwan. Its production lines include PU resin, DOP and polymer materials.
The company has made huge investments in China, Hong Kong and Southeast
Asia.

Far Eastern Group looking to raise cash

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Far Eastern Group hopes to raise US$120 million in funds for two of
its companies by selling global depositary receipts (GDRs) in Europe this
year.

 GDRs are bonds that are convertible into warrants - certificates allowing
the transfer of the bonds into stocks - and are held on reserve in banks.

 Jean-Francois di Meglio, country manager of French bank Banque Paribas,
said last week that his banks, BZW and ING Barings, lead the world in the
sale of GDRs. They expect to sell US$60 million worth of GDRs for Far
Eastern Silo and Shipping before the end of the year.

 ``GDRs are currently at a premium. It's more difficult for foreigners to
buy GDRs. But they are largely responsible for the building up of the
Taiwan stock exchange since March of this year,'' said di Meglio.

 C.S. Tsai, a senior official of the Intercontinental Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC), said the ICBC is co-underwriting the sale of GDRs for Far
Eastern Textile. The textile firm is releasing over 30 million shares
worth over US$60 million. The sale began on September 12.

 The two Far Eastern companies reportedly will use funds generated from
the GDR sale to clear bank debts and to finance expansion projects.

 A high-ranking Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official said the
boom in the sale of GDRs and corporate bonds is likely to continue on the
strength of high annual profits from bond funds.

 Di Meglio, however, said GDR investors are demanding that the ROC
government give them a guarantee of convertibility from the date of bond
issue. The government has restricted conversion in the past due to a fear
of capital outflows.

MOEA approves US$328 in investments

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a series of new investment
projects yesterday worth US$328 million that include foreigners'
investments in Taiwan and Taiwan outbound investments, including several
going to China.

 The ministry gave the nod to eight plans by foreign firms to invest up to
US$266.4 million for projects inside Taiwan, and agreed to seven projects
for Taiwan companies to invest NT$36.24 million in China.

 Among the approved foreign investments here is one by GTE of the US,
which will remit US$32.7 million into Taiwan to set up a joint venture
with Taiwan partners that will offer the services of global system for
mobile phone communications in Taiwan. Germany's Mannesmann Eurokom will
also bring US$21.8 million into the joint venture.

 Two other foreign firms have been permitted to send capital into Taiwan
to also form joint ventures to provide telecom services.

 There were three new investment projects by Taiwan enterprises in China
and four firms with existing mainland investments plan to boost their
capital there.

 On of the major investors is Mitac International's US$10 million plan to
manufacture personal computers and peripherals in China.

 President Enterprises will spend US$996 million to establish a beer
brewery in Zhuhai, Guangdong province with the Kirin Group of Japan.

 And Yuen Foong Yu Paper will invest US$550 million to engage in the
production of paper, paper board, paper cartons, and printing business in

 Fubon Securities' new fund will be over NT$2 billion with the initial
strategy focusing on a portfolio composed of shares in the electronic,
construction, and electric machinery industries as well as financial
institutions and China concept shares.

 Core Pacific Securities will also raise at least NT$1 billion. Before the

Women's group hands out awards to `sisters'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Special assistant to the DPP chairman Sissy Chen was recognized as being
the most daring woman who tried new jobs over the past year by the Taipei
Women Rights Promotion Association.

 The association marked its third founding anniversary yesterday by
selecting top 10 news making women who have drawn much public attention
over the past year.

 Chen made the list because she had changed jobs many times since her
return from the US a year ago, the association said.

 Chen first worked for a prospective woman presidential candidate, then
headed the DPP's publicity department. Following the March 23 presidential
election, she worked for a music company for a short period of time, and
then returned to the DPP to serve as Hsu's special assistant.

 The association selected Annie Lee as the ``best actress'' of a ``real
life'' soap opera.

 Lu first made headlines after accusing a Normal Taiwan University
professor of sexually harassing her. Lu blamed the professor for unfairly
preventing her from pursuing a doctoral degree at the school.

 She was later found to be having an affair with Wang Wen-yang, the son of
Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching. Wang was forced to resign
from his father's company after his affair with Lu were exposed.

 KMT Legislator Shen Chih-hui was selected ``the woman most vulnerable to
injuries'' because she sustained serious injuries after being kicked by
New Party Legislator Fu Kun-cheng.

 The association also selected Li Ming-jou, a radio DJ who was adored by
many teenagers, as the most daring woman for her sensational talks.

 Meanwhile, clients of all beauty centers were selected ``women easiest to
be conned.''

Ambassador issues open invitation

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 South African Ambassador Johannes L. Viljoen has expressed hope that more
Taiwan tourists will visit his country as a vacation destination.

 Viljoen, addressing a crowd at a flower exhibition on Saturday for Moon
Festival in Taichung, noted that 34,800 Taiwan tourists visited South
Africa last year.

 The number was the largest among Asian nations, and the fifth largest in
the world, he said, adding that South African attached great importance on
the high number of Taiwan tourists.

 Viljoen spoke enthusiastically about his country's wide range of
resources. He also noted that South African Airway's passenger potential
has increased by 20 percent annually.

 He said that South Africa is trying to attract more foreign tourists by
promoting its unique culture, climate and scenic beauty.

 South Africa will enter into spring next month and the welcome mat is out
for Taiwan.

Gambling plan slammed: Legalized gambling will only lead to more crime,
official

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 The legalization of gambling is not likely to eradicate underground
gambling houses in Taiwan, a senior tourist official said yesterday.

 ``The legalization of gambling would only serve as fuel for the gambling
fever here,'' Chang Hsueh-lao, deputy director-general of the Tourism
Bureau, asserted in a TTV news program.

 Gambling is rampant in Taiwan even though it is illegal. Some lawmakers
have urged the government to allow the establishment of tourist casinos
which they say can help increase government tax revenues and wipe out
underground gambling houses.

 Speaking on a TTV news program, Chang refuted the argument, saying local
people generally do not like to gamble at public places.

 ``I'm afraid that legally licensed casinos cannot attract prospective
gamblers,'' he noted.

 Chang further said legalization of gambling may give local people the
misleading impression that gambling is not a bad thing. This message would
help fuel the gambling mania around the island.

 The Tourism Bureau has considered opening tourist casinos on selected
offshore islands to lure foreign tourists, Chang said, adding that such
casinos would only be open to foreign passport holders. However, Chang
said, the bureau has dropped the idea after a feasibility study showed
negative results.

 For one thing, Chang said, establishing a casino alone cannot attract
foreign tourists to Taiwan. It is also not expected to provide enough
incentive to lure local gamblers who are usually more interested in
gambling at underground places where gamblers can hide their true
identities and engage in all types of games.

 Several lawmakers earlier this year jointly drafted a bill governing the
establishment of tourist casinos. According to the draft bill, such
casinos would be open to local people aged 18 or older. Strong opposition
from the government and academics persuaded the Legislative Yuan's
Judiciary Committee to not screen the controversial bill.

PRC claim on ROC `unjustified': academic

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 BRUSSELS - Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of its territory cannot
be justified under modern international law, according to a well known
Belgian academic.

 Jean-Marie Henckaerts, professor of international law at the University
of Brussels, states in a new book that Taiwan is a de facto country in
terms of international law, even if it is not yet recognized by all
countries in the world.

 The book, The International Status of Taiwan in the New World Order,
published in Boston and London in September, is a compilation of the
papers and reports read at a symposium sponsored by the University of
Brussels last June.

 Henckaerts states that a country is only a means of providing protection
to its people rather than a goal in itself, therefore, it is up to the
people of Taiwan to determine what is best for them and who owns the
island.

 In his view, Taiwan has met every criteria necessary to become a member
of the United Nations. No rules under current international law forbid
Taiwan from joining that world body.

 The author doubted Beijing's sovereignty claim to Taiwan, saying the
People's Republic of China, established in 1949, has not ruled the
territory governed by the Republic of China since 1945.

 Henckaerts can not see how Beijing can threaten to take Taiwan by force.
He believes it is the moral and legal duty of the international community
to safeguard Taiwan's freedom of choice, and make it clear to Beijing that
the international community will not accept the use of force as a way to
solve the Taiwan issue.

 He urges European countries to form a common front to deal with Beijing.

6,000 protest Japan's claims: Taipei march to `protect the Tiaoyutai'

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 More than 6,000 protesters took to the streets of Taipei yesterday
morning in the largest demonstration yet against Japan's recent claims to
the disputed Tiaoyutai islands.

 Led by a huge ROC flag and chanting ``protect the Tiaoyutai'' and ``down
with Chinese militarism,'' the protesters wound their way from the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall, through downtown Taipei to the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall.

 As they marched, the feelings of frustration and indignation were strong.

 ``The Tiaoyutai islands belong to the Chinese,'' protester Wei Tsu-chun
said. ``We Chinese people cannot be bullied by any country. We cannot
tolerate any country invading our territory.''

 ``Every Chinese person is furious when we hear Japan occupies our
Tiaoyutai islands,'' protester Chang Shu-fan said. ``I wish they would
leave immediately.''

 A wooden model of Bruce Lee was raised above the crowd along with a
Japanese sumo wrestler for Bruce Lee to kick. Above the models, a sign
read: ``The fierce dragon saves the nation.''

 New Party Legislator Chu Hui-liang, speaking at a rally following the
march, focused on rejecting what she called the Japanese cultural
infiltration of Taiwan by programming on cable TV.

 ``We want to see our own programs, right?'' she shouted to the crowd.
``Right,'' came the unanimous reply.

 Several other New Party lawmakers took turns to call on President Lee
Teng-hui for stronger action to assert sovereignty over the islands. They
also called for a boycott of Japanese goods.

 The New Party, which organized the event along with the ROC Alliance for
the Protection of the Tiaoyutai, gathered signatures for a drive to send a
million petitions to the president.

 One man holding a picture of Lee Teng-hui shouted: ``Remove Lee Tenghui
from office.''

 ``Lee Teng-hui has Japanese relatives, that is why he is so weak,'' he
said.

 Li Mi, a professor of International Ocean Law at National Taiwan Ocean
University, said: ``Look at Korea. They stood up against Japan and Japan
left. The people in Taiwan are different, though.''

 Shung King Fai, a Hong Kong Regional Council member, also took part in
yesterday's protest, telling the rally that all Chinese people should
unite in defense of the Tiaoyutai islands.

 Meanwhile, a small group of protesters set sail from Hong Kong yesterday
for a three-day trip to the Tiaoyutai chain.

 The protesters plan to raise a Chinese flag on one of the islands.

 Japanese coastal authorities have said they will turn the boat back if it
tries to enter its territorial waters.

 ``We emphasis that our protest will be peaceful but we are also prepared
to sacrifice ourselves to protect our islands,'' said spokesman David Chan.

 The ship carried 18 protesters, all men and aged between 25 to 68,
wearing green T-shirts and red headbands.

 The cargo ship was chartered by the Alliance of Worldwide Chinese for the
Protection of the Tiaoyutai Islands. It also carried 42 accompanying
journalists and 19 crew members.

 It was renamed the ``Bao-Tiao,'' or ``Tiaoyutai Islands Defender,'' for
the trip.

 ``We have taken no weapons,'' said Captain Ngai Lup-chee. ``If the
Japanese shoot at us, we will get away.''

 The group has asked for protection from the Chinese navy.

 Meanwhile, Japanese media reported yesterday that President Lee has
expressed the desire to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to talk about regional security.

 Lee apparently made the request to Shinji Sato, president of Liberal
Democratic Party's Sino-Japanese parliamentarian group, earlier this month.

 The chance of such a meeting taking place, however, is considered slim.

Deep Chinese rifts remain despite anti-Japan unity

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 At a glance, it would seem Asia's disparate Chinese communities at last
have found a common voice as they angrily denounce Japan's claim of
sovereignty over a deserted East China Sea archipelago.

 But have they?

 In the weeks since Japanese ultranationalists built a shaky lighthouse to
assert Japan's title to what it calls the Senkaku islands, a collective
Chinese howl of indignation has arisen in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and
China.

 Daily protests, mostly small but a few attracting 10,000 or more people,
have stirred a sense that after a century of profound political rifts and
civil war, Chinese fundamental interests have begun to coalesce, with
Japan as catalyst.

 Fuelled by the islands dispute, this anti-Japanese Chinese nationalism
peaked on Sept. 18 - 65 years to the day after Japan invaded northeast
China to visit 14 years of atrocities on China's people and drag Asia into
World War II.

 Observers muse aloud whether the seemingly unanimous Chinese reaction to
Japan's territorial claim - that the islands are called the Tiaoyutai, not
the Senkakus, and belong to China - signals a closing of Chinese ranks.

 Has a ``Chinese century'' begun to dawn?

 Political experts say no, pointing to deep-seated and complex forces they
say will check the emergence of any influential new ``greater China''
nationalism or realignments in the fundamental China-Taiwan-Hong Kong
balance of power.

 Both Beijing and Taipei, experts say, are unwilling to allow a dispute
with Japan over the unpopulated isles to affect their own five-decade-old
battle of wits over the fate of Taiwan - a far higher priority - or to
stir up domestic unrest.

 ``Cross-strait ties (between Taiwan and China) have a special dynamic
which will not be influenced by the Tiaoyutai island row,'' said Soochow
University political scientist Luo Chih-chen.

 Luo said Beijing could not forcefully assert its sovereignty because this
would highlight its failure to win back Taiwan.

 ``In essence, the Tiaoyutai problem is the same as the Taiwan problem,''
Luo said. ``If China wanted to face the Tiaoyutai problem, it would be
forced to face the Taiwan problem.''

 Gallup pollster Tim Ting said it was impossible for China and Taiwan to
mount a united stand or even take firm unilateral measures against Japan,
since China fears offending Japanese investors and Taiwan wants to count
on Japanese and US support in any confrontation with the mainland.

 ``Chances are Taiwan, Japan and China will all play down the sovereignty
issue and the only understanding reached eventually will be on something
less controversial, like fishing rights in waters around the islands,''
Ting said.

 Powerful local forces are also at work, analysts say.

 Most of Taiwan's anti-Japan protests have been organized by the tiny but
vocal New Party, whose members hope to use the islands issue to undermine
President Lee Teng-hui, who they suspect longs for Taiwan's formal
independence rather than integration with China.

 ``It is only very few people in Taiwan who are trying to use this
opportunity to arouse nationalistic sentiment,'' said political scientist
Lu Ya-li of National Taiwan University.

 ``The majority of people, quite frankly, don't care.''

 In Hong Kong, even the Democratic party, which fears a loss of freedom in
the British colony after it returns to Chinese rule in mid-1997, has
voiced support for Beijing's claim to the Tiaoyutai islands and suspicion
of Japan.

 But analysts say various groups have different motives for urging Beijing
to use force to claim back the islands.

 ``For pro-China parties, this is simply a chance to win favor with
Beijing,'' a Taipei diplomat said.

 ``But for the Democrats, pressuring Beijing for a military response is a
way of wielding a very popular issue to exert political influence that
China does not want them to have.''

MAC calls for strong post 1997 links

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh has called for a solid
and stable relationship between Taiwan and Hong Kong after the British
colony's handover to Chinese rule in 1997.

 Speaking at a Taipei seminar on Taiwan-Hong Kong-China trade and economic
relations after 1997 over the weekend, Chang said a solid and stable
Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship would serve as the starting point for the
development of new trade and economic, and even general relations, among
the three Chinese communities.

 Chang, however, warned that post-1997 TaiwanHong Kong ties would be
lacking protection without the support of government authorities.

 Chang stressed that to maintain a stable post1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong
relationship would involve such sensitive issues as marine transportation
and Taiwan agencies' stay in Hong Kong. He said the council was ready to
talk with Beijing on these issues.

 He said that Beijing's recent promulgation of regulations governing
Taiwan-China shipping was just part of its `twohanded' policy aimed at
alienating Taiwan so as to enable itself to play a dominant role in
post-1997 Taiwan-Hong Kong relations, and force Taipei to accept its
version of the `one China' principle.

Overseas Chinese may improve ties

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 CANBERRA - Overseas Chinese in Australia and many other countries can
play a role in boosting understanding and peace between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, the vice chairman of Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission (OCAC) said Saturday.

 In an interview with the CNA, Hung Tung-kuei said she believed overseas
Chinese can contribute a great deal by persuading Beijing leaders that,
``Chinese do not fight Chinese.''

 During her first visit to Australia since assuming her present position
three months ago, Hung spoke of her visits to Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Austria, San Francisco, Houston and South Africa and of the
overseas Chinese she had met living in these places.

 ``Everywhere I go, I convey the message of President Lee Teng-hui and
Vice President Lien Chan. The ROC government will not forget contributions
made by overseas Chinese and will increase relations with them,'' she said.

 She said there are still many tasks to be accomplished for helping
overseas Chinese and improving relations with them, including language
training, cultural seminars and the provision of Chinese educational
materials.

 ``The promotion of Chinese language and culture among overseas Chinese
worldwide is one of the main objectives of our government,'' she said.

 She said most Chinese parents residing in other countries have come to
know the importance of Chinese language and culture for their children.

 An increasing number of foreign governments also have come to realize
that Chinese language is a very important tool in their push to open vast
markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. In addition, many
Southeast Asian countries have millions of overseas Chinese playing
important roles in their business and economic sectors, she noted.

 She said the purpose of her trips is to meet as many overseas Chinese as
possible and in doing so, learn what the ROC government can offer to
fulfill their needs.

Beijing asked to take back illegals

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 With the approach of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) has again urged China to implement the Kinmen Agreement and
immediately take back the 800-plus current illegal mainland immigrants.

 ``As the Mid-Autumn Festival is an important occasion for family
gatherings for the Chinese, we hope all detained mainland immigrants will
be able to return to their homeland before the festival,'' said MAC Vice
Chairman Kao Koonglian on Sunday.

 The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as Moon Festival, falls on Sept. 27
this year.

 To show his concern for detained migrants, MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh
will make an inspection tour of the Hsinchu detention house in northern
Taiwan on Monday. It is the largest of the five mainland migrants
detention centers in Taiwan.

 According to the Kinmen Agreement signed by the ROC Red Cross Society and
its mainland counterpart in September 1990, each side is obligated to take
back people who have illegally entered the other territory.

 Under the agreement, mainland authorities must send ships to Taiwan's
offshore islands of Kinmen or Matsu to take back their illegal immigrants,
while Taiwan is responsible for sending the immigrants to Kinmen or Matsu.

 Over the past six years, China has not only been unable to effectively
rein in its people's immigration drive but has also been slow in taking
back illegals held in Taiwan, adding to Taiwan's social burden.

 Moreover, some detained illegal mainland immigrants have staged hunger
strikes to protest their long detention in Taiwan.

 MAC statistics show that Taiwan has detained 34,019 illegal mainland
immigrants since 1987. A total of 33,200 of them have been repatriated but
a large portion remain at five detention centers around the island. About
20 of them have been in Taiwan for more than a year.

Prosecutors to lose power to detain suspects

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Prosecutors will lose their power to order the indefinite detention of
suspects under investigation, according to a revision being made to the
Code of Criminal Procedure.

 The revision was recently worked out by an ad hoc committee of the
Judicial Yuan to comply with a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices.
The ruling states that such powers are unconstitutional and must be
revised by the end of next year.

 Prosecutors have been authorized to detain suspects because they used to
be considered part of the court system, but the Council of Grand Justices
believes that prosecutors and judges have different duties and therefore
belong to different systems.

 Under the revision, all decisions to order custody of suspects must be
approved by court judges instead of prosecutors, beginning in 1998.

 In addition to the part concerning the power of custody, some provisions
of the Code of Criminal Procedure will also revised according to the
revision to be sent to the legislature for screening and approval.

 For instance, the maximum period of custody for investigation will be
shortened from two to one month, but will be able to be extended for a
month if necessary. Custody for trials will be shortened to two months.

 Under no circumstances can a person suspected of committing a minor crime
and is subject to only a fine, be taken into custody.

 Police will not be allowed to question suspects in the evenings, unless
such questioning is approved by prosecutors or judges in advance because
of the pressing need to get information related to the crimes they have
committed, according to the revision.

Peng feels no remorse over DPP: Ex-DPP presidential candidate critical of
plans to negotiate with KMT

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Former DPP presidential candidate Peng Ming-min yesterday again blasted
the DPP for its plan to cooperate with the KMT, saying the party should
try to expand its popular base by persuading people to accept its policies
instead of bargaining with the KMT for a few government posts.

 Peng made the remark while presiding over the inauguration of the
Kaohsiung branch of the NationBuilding Association, which he founded after
the March presidential race.

 Some of the association's leaders have recently announced their plan to
break away from the DPP to organize a new political party the Taiwan
Independence Party, after accusing the DPP of softening its stand on
Taiwan independence.

 Peng told his supporters that he did not owe the DPP anything. He said he
won the DPP's presidential nomination because of his efforts in vying for
voter support during the primaries.

 Peng said he has delivered 300 public speeches pushing his political
ideals long before the DPP decided to nominate him to run for the
presidency.

 His role in the presidential election prevented the DPP from breaking up
earlier, Peng said.

 ``It was wrong for the DPP to describe itself as the `mainstream' of
Taiwan's opposition movement,'' Peng said. ``The DPP is nothing but an
`episode' of this movement that started after Japan occupied Taiwan nearly
a century ago.''

 Peng criticized DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang for meeting President Lee in
private. ``The DPP should fight to become the ruling party by appealing
for public support with its policies and by supervising the KMT's
administration, instead of trying to get a few government posts through
secret deals with the KMT,'' Peng said.

 DPP Spokesman and Cultural Affairs Director Kuo Cheng-liang said he
sympathizes with Peng's situation after losing the presidential race, but
added that he could not agree with Peng's criticism of the party.

 The DPP has never before negotiated with the KMT for a few posts as a
condition for its cooperation with the KMT, nor has it done anything to
betray the opposition movement.

 The DPP might have adjusted its way of thinking, but this is because it
has to consider the Taiwan issue from a broader point of view for the sake
of Taiwan's future, instead of judging things from the standpoint of
people suffering from political persecution as it did in the past, Kuo
said.

 Kuo said he did not expect Peng to be punished for openly criticizing the
DPP. ``Peng is still a senior adviser to the DPP, but he has not paid his
party membership fees for a long time,'' Kuo said while explaining Peng's
status in the party.

Taiwan is a `treasure island`

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Taiwan is a good place for treasure hunting and archaeological studies
judging from the huge number of sunken vessels in waters in this area,
experts said yesterday.

 A group of archaeologists led by Huang Kuang-nan, curator of the Taiwan
History Museum, have recently found hundreds of pieces of antiques hidden
in a sunken vessel near Penghu.

 Their discovery was a encouragement to people who are planning to explore
what might have be buried at the bottom of the sea around Taiwan.

 ``There were more than 10,000 sunken vessels in the Taiwan Strait
according to historical documents,'' said Wu Chien-ming, chairman of the
Water Resources Planning Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

 As early as 1830, Great Britain began running the sea route between
Europe and China. After that, more vessels came from the US and other
European countries, Wu said.

 There were few documents concerning vessels in distress before 1850.
According to an American reporter's investigative report, between 1850 and
1870, over 150 vessels capsized in the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.

Lake swimmers go for world record

from CHINA NEWS, 23 September 1996

 Over 11,000 people participated in a swim across Sun Moon Lake yesterday,
hoping to earn a spot in the Guinness Book of Records.

 With the crack of the starters pistol at 9:00 am sharp, the swimmers
splashed into the scenic lake in Nantou County, central Taiwan. Lin
Chiang-tsai, commissioner of Taiwan Province Department of Construction,
and Lin Yuan-Lang, Nantou County magistrate, fired the starting shots.

 Hsieh Shen-shan, chairman of the Council for Labor Affairs, Legislators
Liao Hsue-kuang and Tsaur Eel-jong also took part in the swim.

 For safety reasons, the organizing committee asked swimmers to stay in
groups of three or five. Several boats and 200 lifeguards were on hand to
protect the participants.

 Officials from the Guinness Book of Records were invited to witness the
swim across the 2,515 meterwide lake.

 Also, 216 disabled people took part in the swim.

 Officials of the organizing committee said that they are trying to list
the event in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest group swim ever
completed.

POVERTY REMAINS PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA

     According to a new report by the UN's Economic Commission
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), released in late
December, only a "handful" of countries in the region made any
sustained progress in cutting poverty during the first half of
the 1990s.  In fact, ECLAC reports that the fallout from
Mexico's financial crisis last year severely eroded even the
small gains in living standards that some countries had
previously achieved.
     In early 1993, ECLAC published an extensive survey on
poverty levels in the region that showed that the ranks of the
poor and indigent swelled dramatically during the 1980s.
According to that study, between 1980 and 1990 the number of
people living below the poverty line climbed by 60 million--
from 136 million to 196 million--thus raising the percentage
of the total population considered poor from 41% to 46%.  At
the same time, the number of people living in extreme poverty
grew from 62.4 million to 93.5 million, or from 19% to 22% of
the total regional population (see Chronicle, 09/22/94).
     ECLAC must yet carry out another comprehensive survey
such as the one released in 1993.  Nevertheless, preliminary
estimates made by ECLAC in October suggest that, during the
first half of the 1990s, the absolute number of people living
in poverty may have grown by another 34 million.  If
population growth during the period is taken into account,
that would mean that about 48% of the total population may now
be living below the poverty line (see NotiSur - Latin American
Political Affairs, 10/20/95).
     In its latest report in December, ECLAC did not offer any
new statistics on poverty.  Rather, the commission announced
that between 1990 and 1994 it was only able to identify six
countries that registered slightly reduced rates of poverty:
Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Uruguay.  And, even
in those countries, there was only a relative improvement at
best in general living standards.
     "Even in countries where economic liberalization programs
were judged a success, such as Chile, the problem of endemic
poverty remained a stubborn reality," reads the report.
     Moreover, ECLAC reports that in 1995 three countries--
Mexico, Costa Rica, and Argentina--appear to have "lost the
ground in the fight against poverty that they had gained in
the preceding years."   The economies of those countries were
the most seriously affected by the currency crisis that
exploded in Mexico in December 1994, leading to a sharp
decline in growth in all three nations last year (see
Chronicle, 11/16/95).
     In fact, ECLAC said that Mexico and Costa Rica
represented "worrisome cases" because poverty is now on the
rise again following years of decline in both countries.
     In general, ECLAC says that, even in the most successful
economies, growth in recent years has not generated enough
jobs to keep pace with population growth.  Unemployment rates
in Latin America seldom dip below 20%, and more often average
30% for the poorest sectors of the region's population,
according to the report.  Real incomes for middle- and lower-
income sectors have fallen in comparison with 1960 levels.
     "A new group of poor people is now emerging that is
creating novel characteristics among the impoverished masses
of Latin America," said ECLAC executive director Ruben
Kaztman.  "The newly poor are by and large educated people who
had previously enjoyed higher patterns of consumption and
access to basic services that they now lack.  The
traditionally poor groups had already been living in severe
poverty, but those who had previously belonged to the middle
classes are now also impoverished."
     According to ECLAC, poverty continues to grow much more
rapidly in Latin American cities than in the countryside,
largely because of the acceleration in rural to urban
migration in recent years.  In a separate study by ECLAC
released in November, the commission reported that about 351
million people--more than 73% of the total population--now
live in urban areas throughout Latin American and the
Caribbean, making the region's cities some of the most densely
populated in the world.
     According to ECLAC, of the world's 15 most populated
cities, four are in Latin America: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,
Mexico City, and Buenos Aires.  And, even though migration to
the largest cities has slowed somewhat in recent years, poor
campesinos continue to flood into medium- and small-sized
cities in search of better opportunities.  ECLAC predicts
that, if the present trend continues, within 30 years Latin
America's urban population will have swelled to 576 million
people, or 85% of the population, even after accounting for
the expected increase in the total number of inhabitants.
     As a result of the demographic explosion in urban areas--
which, for the first time, is making poverty in Latin America
an overwhelmingly urban phenomenon--infrastructure is being
stretched to the breaking point.  For example, in another
ECLAC study also released in late December, the commission
estimated that there is a shortage of 20 million living
quarters in urban areas throughout the region.  In addition,
of the estimated 93 million living quarters that do exist,
only about 56 million, or 60%, meet minimally acceptable
standards.  About 20 million are "damaged" and the remaining
17 million are in a "precarious" state.
     Notwithstanding the severity of ECLAC's estimates, some
regional experts offer even more dismal appraisals of poverty
levels and even graver predictions for the future.  According
to Bernardo Kliksberg, executive director of the Inter-
American Institute for Social Development--which was set up by
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)--as of 1990 at least
50% of the total regional population already lived in poverty.
And, Kliksberg estimates that by the year 2000, about 57% of
the population will have slipped below the poverty line.
     Kliksberg, who was the keynote speaker at a regional
conference on poverty held in Venezuela in mid-November, says
that at present about 1.5 million people die each year as a
result of poverty in Latin America.
     The rapid spread of poverty has begun to alarm even the
multilateral lending institutions, which now promise to
channel much more aid into social development projects in the
region.  In unusually candid terms, IDB president Enrique
Iglesias recently stated that the increase in poverty is
largely a result of the structural adjustment programs pushed
by the IDB, the World Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) since the early 1980s.
     "During the last decade, the central concerns were how to
overcome hyperinflation, survive economically, and maintain
payments on the foreign debt," said Iglesias in an interview
with the Uruguayan magazine Posdata, published in early
November.  "As a result, efforts to deal with the social
conditions of our citizens were postponed, and those
conditions grew worse.  Now that the economies of the region
have become more manageable, we must begin to focus on social
problems, especially the appearance of large groups of newly
poor who have emerged as a byproduct of structural adjustment
policies."
     Iglesias warned that governments must begin to deal with
social problems immediately, before those problems spin out of
control.
     "Marginalized social groups, whose problems have largely
been ignored, are making their presence known in stark forms
throughout Latin America, such as the uprising of Indian
communities in the Mexican state of Chiapas and the recent
popular revolts in some provinces in Argentina," said
Iglesias.  "Those episodes clearly demonstrate that there is
a growing social activism that can no longer be ignored."

CUBA: OFFICIALS PREDICT CONTINUED GROWTH IN TOURISM
AIDED BY EUROPEAN & LATIN AMERICAN INVESTMENT

     The Cuban tourism sector finished 1995 with a strong
showing in the number of travelers visiting the island.  Gross
receipts from tourism may soon become the country's most
important source of hard currency.
     Meanwhile, as the government concentrates on hotel
expansion and carefully planned cruise-ship projects with
European and Latin American investors, US travel executives
worry that the US economic embargo will shut them completely
out of the promising Cuban travel market.
     Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
announced in November that the government expects earnings
from tourism to surpass sugar export earnings.  Poor sugar
harvests in the last three years have underlined the high cost
of dependence on sugar.  A sugar-for-oil barter deal with
Russia, signed Oct. 15, 1995, may prove disappointing because
of lower-than-expected results in the early stages of the
1995-1996 harvest, despite a US$200 million investment in
trucks, spare parts, and other harvesting inputs (see
Chronicle, 10/12/95).  As a result, planners now see tourism
as a more stable source of convertible currency.
     The Center for Cuban Economic Studies (Centro de Estudios
de la Economia Cubana) estimates that the planned development
of 67 tourist destinations on the island with a capacity to
accommodate 10 million tourists in 200,000 rooms will
eventually gross as much as US$15 billion annually.  While
this is a far cry from the US$1 billion predicted for 1996,
the Tourism Ministry (MINTUR) estimates that it will have
close to 50,000 rooms in place and will gross US$3.5 billion
annually in just four years.
     To finance such massive expansion, MINTUR is counting on
foreign investors covering much of the US$2.4 billion required
to develop the 67 resorts.  At present MINTUR is involved in
negotiations with over 200 prospective investors from 28
countries, and total foreign investment already secured
amounts to US$300 million.
     MINTUR predicts that 900,000 tourists will visit the
island in 1996.  This compares with an estimated 745,000 in
1995 and 630,000 in 1994.  Part of the increase in tourism
last year is explained by the gradual dissipation of the
negative public image that resulted from the August 1994
exodus of 30,000 Cubans who sailed for US waters in rafts.
     In addition, during the past two years, Cuba has improved
its tourism infrastructure with new hotel construction and
cruise-ship terminals.  On Dec. 2, 1995, Havana's new terminal
received its first ship, the 500-berth Costa Playa owned by
Italian cruise operator Costa Crociere.  The terminal is
housed in an 80-year old customs building renovated by Costa
Crociere as part of a US$12 million joint venture with the
Cuban government.  Costa Crociere has also renovated a
terminal in Santiago de Cuba in southeastern Cuba and plans to
build a third terminal in Mariel, west of Havana.
     It took Costa Crociere chairman Alfonso Lavarello two
yeise lines have
sent representatives to Cuba to negotiate cruise-ship
contracts, including the London-based P&O line and Kloster
Cruises Ltd., a subsidiary of the Norwegian Vard line.
     Nevertheless, Cuban tourism planners are moving slowly
into the cruise business.  Growth in the number of cruise
lines calling on Cuban ports will be controlled as part of an
integrated tourism strategy.
     Central to that strategy is hotel construction, while the
cruise-ship sector will be kept at between 4% and 5% of the
tourism industry's gross receipts.  Cuba now has 25,000 hotel
rooms, double the number it had in 1989, and new construction
financed by foreign investment is in the works.  For example,
the French hotel company Accord plans to build 1,330 hotel
rooms on Cayo Coco off the northern coast of Cuba.  The
Mexican Grupo Domos, which is heavily invested in Cuban
telecommunications, and the Canadian mining firm Sherritt are
both planning to expand into hotel and resort ventures.
     Thousands of additional rooms rented out by private
citizens for a fraction of the price charged by resort hotels
augment the industry's capacity.  In recent months the
government has taken steps to control dollar distribution and
to tax private services that have sprung up since late 1993,
when the economy was opened up to a degree of private
enterprise (see Chronicle, 10/26/95).  But rather than
clamping down on unauthorized room rental businesses, MINTUR
has begun to regulate them and has set up an agency called
Dulce Hogar to place tourists in private houses and
apartments.
     While European and Latin American investors move into the
growing Cuban travel market, their US counterparts are showing
increasing impatience with the 33-year old economic embargo
and restrictions on travel by US citizens to Cuba.
     In early December, a group of executives from US credit-
card companies, travel agencies, and other travel-related
businesses went to Havana to talk with MINTUR officials and to
visit hotels and other tourist facilities in and around Havana
and Santiago de Cuba.
     The visit was surrounded by some secrecy as the names and
affiliations of the visitors were not made available to the
media.  But Cuban officials said it was the largest group from
the US travel industry to come to Cuba since the triumph of
the revolution in 1959.  John Kavulich, president of the
US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which coordinated the
visit, said it was a "private, familiarization trip."
     But at a White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in
November, the subject of Cuba was not on the agenda.  However,
Darryl Hartley-Leonard, chairman of the Hyatt Hotels
corporation said, "Everybody discusses Cuba.  All the time."
     "I think we're losing it," Hartley-Leonard said.  "Have
we completely lost out?  No.  But we're losing an opportunity.
All of us encourage continual review of our policies toward
that country.  It's the next great international opportunity,
far more than the East bloc.  But Congress, in its wisdom,
chooses to reinforce the embargo."  (Sources: San Jose Mercury

By Dale Andrade

You never know where terrorists might turn up. They might
be anywhere, though we have a hard time believing that
they live among us. Sure, a few homegrown ones surface
here in the United States now and then, but how about the
international variety, particularly the ones who wreak
havoc throughout the Middle East?

Unless you followed the news very closely, you probably
missed the shocker of the year: the new head of Islamic
Jihad is a college professor from the University of
Florida in Tampa. That's right. As hard as it is to
believe that a high-ranking leader from one of the most
violent terrorist organizations in the Middle East might
be living here in the States, that is exactly what
happened.

Islamic Jihad is an Iranian-backed organization with a
sworn hatred of Israel and an intractable opposition to
the Middle East peace process. Its suicide bombers have
killed several Israeli soldiers and an American college
student. Although overshadowed by Hamas, during the past
few months Israeli intelligence has kept an especially
watchful eye on Islamic Jihad, which last October saw its
last leader, Fathi Shiqaqi, assassinated in Malta,
probably by Israeli agents.  While all this was
happening, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah quietly minded his
own business as a professor of Middle
Eastern studies at the University of South Florida.
Fellow faculty members and students remembered Shallah as
a scholar concerned about the image of Islam worldwide.
"He didn't
seem like a radical to me," one of Shallah's students
told the New York Times. Another said there was "never
any
indication that he had any sympathy with acts of terror
for anyone's cause."

Last June, Dr. Shallah left the United States saying he
needed to tend to his gravely ill father in Gaza. In
reality he went back to take the reins of Islamic Jihad.
With the
death of Shiqaqi, the mild-mannered professor tore off
his mask and declared Israel to be the implacable enemy
of Arabs in the Middle East and swore to destroy the
peace process. Shallah praised the assassination of
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and promised a "hard
war" against Israel.

There's another twist to the story. While Shallah may
have fooled his academic colleagues, his cover roused the
suspicion of the most hardcore of Islamic fundamentalists
-- the mullahs in Iran. Immediately after word went out
that
Shallah was the new head of Islamic Jihad, Tehran let it
be known that he has had "suspicious contacts" with US
and
British intelligence. Both groups deny any ties, but note
that Iran thinks Shallah is too moderate for the job.

Why hole up in Tampa rather than Iran? According to the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the scenario fits
precisely with Islamic Jihad's new tactics. Beginning in
1988 the group began moving its leaders who were not
directly involved in terrorism to quiet spots overseas.
Modern technology in the form of faxes and the Internet
has allowed them to stay in touch and ready for action at
a
moment's notice. How many others might be under our
noses?
Unfortunately, CTS has not been able to unmask any other
"sleeping" terrorists, but we do have articles designed
to keep security professionals on top of the latest in
counterterrorism. Associate Editor Jack Plaxe profiles
the US State Department's "Rewards Program for Terrorism
Information," which promises $2 million for vital
information which prevents a terrorist act or leads to
the apprehension of wanted terrorists. In this issue we
also
propose new measures to enhance the security of civil
aviation, and look at how organized crime is threatening
the economic security of South Africa. Contributing
editor Tom Marks looks at the ongoing terrorism in Sri
Lanka, one of
the world's last bastions of Marxist insurgency. On the
practical side, learn about new techniques in crisis
management, plus what to do to prevent being kidnapped,
or if you are, how to survive the ordeal.

In short, there's something in this issue for everyone in
the security business.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part I

Your early morning flight from Los Angeles International
Airport to Washington, DC, has leveled off at 37,000
feet. As the plane crosses the Rocky Mountains, flight
attendants scurry up and down the aisles serving
breakfast. You settle back into your seat to watch the
movie.

Suddenly, without warning, your senses are overwhelmed by
a deafening bang and a billowing cloud of smoke. You
barely have time to scream before you find yourself
hurtling through the air, surrounded by passengers and
debris from the disintegrating aircraft. Deprived of
oxygen and suffering from shock, you black out as your
body accelerates toward the earth. You, along with 299
other passengers and crew, have died because of a
terrorist bomb hidden in luggage stowed in the jet's
belly.

Fortunately, most air travelers will never experience the
horror of being sucked out of an airplane following an
in-flight explosion. Yet this scenario is more than an
idle fantasy conjured by a fertile imagination. Since
1985 more than 1,000 passengers and crew have died
because terrorists penetrated security and smuggled a
bomb on board a civilian airliner. Airplanes of carriers
such as Pan Am, TWA, UTA, and Avianca have been bombed by
terrorists, with devastating consequences.

Aviation bombings are rare, but they represent a serious
threat that the aviation community is not yet prepared to
counter effectively and consistently, especially within
the continental United States. While security measures
are in place to reduce vulnerabilities to this threat, we
are still years away from deploying explosive detection
systems that are reliable, efficient, and cheap.

Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is
moving proactively to beef up domestic security and
eliminate the gap between international and domestic
procedures. This has sparked an outcry from airline
executives and airport operators--who have legitimate
concerns that they will be unable to bear the financial
cost estimated at over $2 billion dollars--of
implementing the newly mandated procedures.

Where is the US aviation security system headed? What are
actual threats facing civil aviation? What are the
implications of tougher domestic security measures for
airline and airport executives as well as the traveling
public? These questions have unleashed a highly
contentious process that will ultimately require both the
federal government and the airline industry to reassess
how aviation security should be organized, implemented,
and funded.
The Aviation Security System

Security for airline passengers currently is handled in
two arenas- one international and one national.
Internationally, security standards set by the
International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Annex
17, offers a least common denominator approach to
security. While accepted internationally, these standards
fall short of providing a tough set of measures that
protect air carriers targeted by terrorists. For
countries like the United States, however, Annex 17 is a
starting point for security rather than the final
destination.


The real action on security occurs at the national level.
By law and by tradition, a nation has the right to set
and enforce aviation security practices for their flag
carriers, regardless of where they operate, and for
foreign carriers that depart from its airports. In actual
operation, however, these rights are not exercised
equally. The United States, in particular, has been very
aggressive in setting the standards and practices used
for aviation security. Its influence is partly due to its
vast market--a huge number of passengers fly on US
carriers, and a large number of foreign carriers want to
fly to the United States.

Two US laws provide the legal foundation guiding how the
US carries out the aviation security mission,
particularly overseas: the Foreign Airport Security Act
of 1986 and the Aviation Security Improvement Act of
1990. Both laws recognize the principle that a
country--in this case the United States--has the
sovereign right to control who lands planes in its
territory. The United States can set standards for any
carrier that wants to land in the United States,
although foreign carriers are not required to use the
same security programs followed by US carriers. The legal
framework also requires the US government to assess
security at any foreign airport where US carriers
operate. In addition, the FAA monitors the overseas
performance of security procedures, such as adding
personnel to screen passengers prior to allowing them on
board a plane, or requiring passengers to be screened
with metal detectors before boarding a plane.

If the world consisted of only one nation, the task of
aviation security would be simple and straightforward. In
the multinational world, however, aviation security
involves more confusion and conflict than clarity. A US
carrier operating in Germany, for instance, must carry
out extraordinary procedures mandated by the FAA. Yet,
the same US air carrier's operations at Frankfurt's
international airport are controlled primarily by
Germany's federal government, and the Hessian State
Government in particular.  While the FAA can dictate the
procedures US carriers must follow and fine them for
lapses in security, its ability to monitor those
procedures falls under the jurisdiction and laws of
Germany. In addition, foreign carriers flying to the
United States claim that under Annex 17 the United
States cannot compel them to impose tighter security
procedures. The FAA can only require foreign carriers to
implement higher standards if they are departing from a
US airport.
For many years the demands of operating in an
international environment have generated friction between
the FAA and US air carriers. Prior to the bombing of Pan
Am 103, US air carriers complained regularly that they
were being held accountable by the US government for
implementing security procedures, but were on their own
in securing the permission of the host government.

In the aftermath of Pan Am 103 the U.S. Government
expanded its role in helping US-based air carriers
resolve disputes with foreign authorities over
implementing security procedures. For instance, US air
carriers operating in Great Britain and Germany in the
spring of 1992 were co-located at check-in counters with
Iran Air. Because of Iran's dubious status as a state
sponsor of terrorism, the carriers expressed fears that
the Iranian airline officials, by virtue of their
proximity, would gain knowledge about US mandated
security procedures. Agreeing that the carriers
had a legitimate concern, the US State Department,
working with the FAA, interceded with British and German
officials to provide a solution.

The FAA is doing a good job of protecting US airline
passengers, but its ability to do an even better job is
hampered by its second-class status within the federal
bureaucracy and internal conflicts resulting from
carrying out its other regulatory missions--e.g., flight
safety and airport operations. At the White House and the
National Security Council, for example, transportation
security issues in general, and aviation in particular,
are handled on an ad hoc basis. This has been the case
for both Democratic and Republican administrations.
Accordingly, the FAA must use a rather convoluted
bureaucratic chain of command to bring serious security
issues to the attention of the president. If the FAA's
Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security
decides punitive action is required against a country for
inadequate security, such as suspending flights, he would
first inform the FAA Administrator who in turn would
present the issue to the Secretary of Transportation. It
is the responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation
to present the issue to the White House.

The FAA's regulatory missions also cloud its security
mission. Witness the recent effort, for example, to raise
security standards at airports around the country. This
has touched off an intensive behind-the-scenes lobbying
campaign by representatives of the air carriers and
airport operators who believe the FAA is going too far.
Many on the commercial side of the aviation industry
argue that the new measures threaten the economic
viability of the industry, and that in the absence of a
specific, credible threat, the additional procedures are
not being implemented in accordance with the criteria
specified in established contingency plans. Along with
industry complaints, some members of Congress have
weighed in on the debate, questioning the basis for the
recommendations of the FAA security experts.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part II

Assessing the Threat

Unfortunately, the wrong question is being asked. We
should be less concerned about whether or not security
officials are accurately evaluating new threat
information and focus instead on whether it is even
appropriate to base an aviation security system on our
ability to get accurate, predictive intelligence.
Traditionally, an increased threat has been the impetus
for installing new security procedures. This approach is
dangerous. Contrary to conventional wisdom, intelligence
agencies rarely get information that permits a policy
maker or security official to take preventative action or
predict what a terrorist will do. It is worth noting that
the vast majority of terrorist attacks against
aviation--most notably the bombings of Pan Am 103 and UTA
772--have occurred without advance warning. The recent
capture of Ramzi Yousef in the Philippines just before he
launched an attack against airliners flying across the
Pacific was a rare exception, and that happened mostly by
luck. Usually, accurately predicting the weather in
Oklahoma next year is far easier than accurately
predicting if there will be a terrorist attack in
Oklahoma City.

The inadequacy of intelligence as a foundation for
determining the appropriate security levels in the United
States has become more difficult because the groups now
responsible for most terrorist activity around the world
are not easily penetrated by traditional intelligence
methods. With the end of the Cold War the threat has
shifted away from national liberation movements to groups
affiliated with extremist religious organizations. We
need only recall the bombing of the World Trade Center,
the nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway, the bus
bombings In Israel, and the airplane hijacking in Algeria
to realize that the culprits are drawn from radical
religious sects rather than the more familiar Cold War
groups, such as the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigade.

Moreover, going after these groups poses some daunting
civil rights and legal issues. Is the United States
prepared to authorize the FBI or the CIA carte blanche to
spy on religious organizations? In the wake of Ruby Ridge
and Waco this appears to be an unlikely option. Yet as we
near the dawn of the 21st century, we are likely to see
more, not fewer, radical groups who believe that they are
agents of some deity to bring to pass a divine judgment
or retribution on a wicked world.

Instead of waiting for a spy to discover a terrorist plot
and pass this information on to the appropriate
authorities, the aviation security system should be
designed to prevent acts and deter threats. Failure to
implement such a system can have disastrous results. The
December 1994 hijacking of an Air France flight from
Algeria is a case in point. Anyone who has monitored the
front page of a major newspaper during 1994 would recall
that Algeria has been wracked for several years by a wave
of terrible terrorist violence. Much of this violence has
been carried out by radical Islamic groups bent on
ousting a secular government. Notwithstanding the
violence, the French adopted the traditional approach to
aviation security by relying on Algerian authorities to
maintain the appropriate level of security. This approach
left 170 passengers and crew vulnerable to the events
that ensued on December 24.

Four hijackers affiliated with the Armed Islamic Group
disguised themselves as airport security officials and
overwhelmed the Air France crew. After killing three
passengers, including a French citizen, the hijackers
were allowed to take off and subsequently land in
Marseilles, France, on December 26. As the situation
continued to deteriorate, French commandos stormed the
plane, rescued the passengers and crew, and killed the
hijackers. The world was aghast when it learned the
hijackers had placed explosives on board the plane,
intending to blow it up in the air over Paris. Only in
the aftermath of this narrowly averted aerial kamikaze
assault on Paris did French security officials tighten
security on flights between Algeria and France and assert
their right to monitor Algerian and the airline
compliance.

The world can no longer run the risk, as did France in
Algeria, of a security system hastily put together in
reaction to specific incidents. During the late 1960s and
early 1970s a surge aircraft hijackings within the United
States prompted the introduction of walk-through metal
detectors at US airports. Requiring pre-board security
screening led subsequently to a dramatic reduction of
domestic hijackings by individuals who had smuggled guns
on board aircraft. We did not see a similar decline in
international hijackings, at least initially, because
neither the United States nor the airlines could
unilaterally force other countries to adopt these
security measures.

Then in the wake of the 1986 hijacking of Pan Am 73,
which resulted in the deaths of 22 people and injuries to
more than 125, the FAA tightened security screening
procedures for US air carriers operating internationally.
Since 1986 no US air carriers have been hijacked because
a terrorist defeated the preboard passenger screening
process.

Coping With Today's Threat

Today we have a sound security system for defeating
hijackings that is rooted in technology--walk through
metal detectors and x-ray--and relies on human operators.
Although a number of systems are coming on the market
that try to automate this procedure or improve the
ability of the security personnel to locate a weapon in
carry-on baggage, the decisions of human beings still
play a large role in ensuring that weapons are not
carried on board an airplane. In the case of explosives
detection, however, the security advantage
evaporates--even in the presence of knowledgeable
security personnel. Unlike the systems to prevent
hijackings, there is no comparable technology presently
available for detecting explosives that meets three key
criteria: reasonably priced, reliable, and efficient.
Instead of solving the problem with technology, the
airline industry is forced to rely on assumptions about
human behavior--such as hoping that most people do not
have a death wish and will not wittingly carry a bomb on
board a plane.

When the FAA ordered airports and airlines in the United
States to implement new security measures in August of
this year they were acting preventively. This is another
sign of the improvements the FAA has made in security
operations since Pan Am 103. Instead of reacting to a
specific threat the FAA is taking into account a variety
of events. Topping the list was the fear of retaliation
from radical Islamic groups if a guilty verdict was
delivered in the conspiracy case against Egyptian cleric
Sheik Rahman. Another concern was the threat issued by
the radical Palestinian group Hamas, warning it would
attack the United States if one of its leaders was
extradited from to Israel. In addition, the FAA believes
the World Trade Center in New York City and the federal
building in Oklahoma City have dispelled the notion that
the United States is domestically immune to the threat of
terrorism. Accordingly, they have decided that there can
no longer be one level of security for international
flights and a lower level for domestic operations.

The implications of this decision are enormous and will
impose substantial economic costs on air carriers and
airports, which will be passed on to the traveling
public. But, in our professional judgment, the FAA's
action is warranted and appropriate for the times. The
major consequence of the FAA decision will be seen in the
area of positive passenger bag match (PPBM). Simply put,
PPBM is coming to America.

Positive passenger bag match ensures that no baggage will
be carried on a plane unless the passenger that checked
the bag is also on board. This system has proven
effective in deterring and preventing aircraft bombings
on international flights. It has not been used
domestically, however, because air carriers say that they
cannot implement the procedure and maintain the same
level of service. Part of the problem is the enormous
volume of domestic traffic and the short connecting time
between flights in the hub and spoke system in use today.
Keeping passengers and bags together is already a
difficult task. Most in the airline industry argue that
PPBM on domestic flights will force a dramatic cutback in
the number of flights and operational efficiency. Yet,
industry insiders also concede that if a bomb explodes on
board a domestic flight any opposition to PPBM will be
moot. Moving to PPBM will be costly. According to sources
in both the FAA and the aviation industry, a recent study
puts the first year cost of implementing PPBM at between
two and three billion dollars. While this is a lot of
money, it works out to roughly two dollars per passenger
per flight. Implementing PPBM would probably remove as
many as three banks of flights per day from the current
ten bank system. This will create inconveniences for
passengers and could bankrupt several of the weaker
carriers, according to industry officials.

Not taking action, however, would be even more costly.
Conservative estimates of the bombing of Pan Am 103 put
expenses at close to two billion dollars. The loss of Pan
Am 103 was a fatal blow to the carrier's viability as a
commercial entity. This financial loss does not include
the emotional suffering of those who lost loved ones.

Aviation Security: New Measures Needed to Meet the New
Century by Larry C. Johnson & Douglas R. Laird. Part III

Next Steps to a Secure Future

We are entering a new era of aviation security that will
change how airlines and airports do business and how you
travel. While the adjustments may not be easy,
particularly in the beginning, the results will make
traveling by air more safe in the long run. The choice
before the US government is whether or not it wants to
strengthen its ability to prevent terrorist acts against
civil aviation. Because US aviation is a high profile
target of terrorist threats, and since commercial
aviation plays an important role in supporting national
defense, the federal government should treat aviation
security as part of a national defense strategy. American
carriers are targeted by terrorists because they have the
US flag on their tails. They are surrogate targets. And
US commercial air carriers play a key role in US military
operations, assisting in the transport of troops or
materiel during national crises. It is, therefore,
reasonable for the federal government to view protecting
commercial aviation as a national security issue.
Instituting this reform would require significant changes
at the Federal level. One approach would be moving the
security function currently performed by the FAA to the
Department of Defense. The responsibility for protecting
commercial airlines should be handled by an Assistant
Secretary for Transportation Security. This job would
have both international and domestic responsibilities. In
addition, the federal government should take on the job
of security at airports rather than leaving it up to
local governments or the private sector. Many foreign
governments successfully carry out aviation security
functions themselves rather than relying on private
industry, and the United States should do the same.

The second step towards better security is eliminating
the dichotomy between international and domestic security
procedures. The FAA deserves praise for moving in this
direction. Unwilling to wait for terrorists to bomb a
domestic airliner, the FAA is pursuing a course of
preventative action by requiring airports and air
carriers operating within the United States to use
security procedures comparable to those in place for
international flights. At the same time, the FAA is going
to need the muscle of the White House and the Secretary
of State to insist that other countries who fly to the
United States use the same kind of security program that
US carriers are required to use.

This issue--known colloquially as the level playing field
within the aviation industry--is very controversial. The
controversy pits US air carriers against the principle of
national sovereignty. The carriers argue that because
they must bear the cost of security requirements levied
by the federal government they are put at a competitive
disadvantage vis-a-vis foreign carriers, who do not have
to adopt the same practices. Yet the FAA alone does not
have the political clout to insist that all countries
coming to the United States must follow the same
procedures. If it tried to enforce this requirement the
FAA would find itself in the middle of a huge foreign
policy wrangle. In fact, several countries have warned
that they will prohibit the FAA from inspecting their
airports if such a law is passed. Without access to these
airports the FAA will be unable to certify whether or not
adequate security procedures are in place to protect US
passengers.

This brings us back to the relevance of treating aviation
security as a national security priority. Eliminating the
gap in security practices and achieving greater
uniformity in security standards requires stronger
federal leadership, starting with the president and the
Congress.

Finally, a critical element in achieving better aviation
security is technology. The mission for protecting
airliners is very simple: do not let unauthorized people
with weapons get on board planes, and do not allow bombs
on board planes. While there is a technological solution
for weapons--guns and knives--there is no similar
technological fix for detecting explosives.

The two best systems on the market for detecting
explosives at airports are dogs and the COX 5000. Mother
Nature still has the edge in explosives detection,
winning by a nose--a dog's nose. But while they are very
effective, dogs are not feasible for handling daily
responsibilities at a high volume airport such as
Chicago's O'Hare or Los Angeles International.

The other option is the CTX 5000, a third generation
x-ray computed tomographic (CT) scanner. Similar to
medical CAT scan technology, the CTX 5000 creates a cross
section image of luggage and analyzes it using
sophisticated software, which automatically identifies
explosives based on their known CT signatures. This is
the only system currently certified by the FAA as an
explosive detection system. One shortcoming of the CTX
5000 is its relatively slow processing speed for bags.
Efficiency could be improved dramatically by using these
units in combination with the airlines' computer
rservation systems to identify passengers whose luggage
needs more scrutiny. The FAA is funding the development
and testing of a computer reservations system that could
be used in conjunction with other security technologies.

Experts agree that presently there are no available
technologies that can be installed in airports that are
reasonably priced, efficient, and reliable. Achieving a
technological solution to the threat of explosives is
feasible but will require a refocused effort. The current
research program under the auspices of the FAA's
Technical Center is spending only $37 million annually to
find a single technology that can meet the operational
requirements of airlines and the security standards of
the FAA. Finding this silver bullet has been an elusive
prey and more difficult task than anyone imagined.

A study commissioned earlier this year by Congressmen
Benjamin Gilman and Lee Hamilton is being conducted by
the General Accounting Office and may provide answers or
recommendations on how to tackle this thorny issue. One
resource that has been ignored in this technological
quest is the national laboratory system. Labs such as
Sandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest are
staffed by scientists and engineers well suited to
looking for answers to these types of questions.
Unfortunately they have not yet been brought to bear on
this issue.

We are moving into a new era of better aviation security.
Because of hard lessons learned from previous terrorist
and criminal attacks the government and industry are
better prepared and in the best position ever to confront
the current threat. Yet the current system is flawed and
additional changes are needed. As the number of
commercial flights continue to expand, the number of
passengers increase, and the next generation of aircraft
are deployed, the vulnerability of the system to
explosives will increase rather than diminish if new
technology is not developed. During the waning years of
the twentieth century, finding a solution to the threat
of explosives will preoccupy government and airline
security officials. It is an area requiring far greater
effort on the part of federal authorities.

"All Hazards" Crisis Management Planning by Geary W.
Sikich

Crisis! Mere mention of the word evokes dread. It seems
you can't turn on the television or pick up a newspaper
anymore without reading about a crisis somewhere. They
can happen anywhere, from faraway countries to the
business around the corner. Yet, crises can be avoided.
Those on the far side of the world may be beyond our
control, but if something happens to your business, it's
your responsibility to solve it. The key is to develop
and implement a well-defined crisis management program.
With one in place, business leaders can mitigate the
potentially disastrous effects of any incident.
Management is never put more strongly to the test than in
a crisis situation. The objectives are immediate and so
are the results. What you and those around you do--or
don't do--will have lasting implications. Today,
individuals responsible for the management of businesses
and public agencies must deal effectively with
increasingly complex laws and issues or face the
consequences.

What if...? You came to your office for the beginning of
your work week and because of some unforseen event there
were no employees, no working telephones, no functioning
computers, no utilities. You're the chief executive. What
would you do? Where would you start? Unquestionably this
is a crisis. Remember, you have access to almost none of
your regular business tools.

If this had been an actual incident, such as many
businesses experienced during the Chicago flood in April
1992, it would already have been too late to concern
yourself with developing a crisis management program!
You've got to have a program in place to ensure
continuity of operations. But, what kind of Crisis
Management Program? To answer this question you must
first define the crisis.

A crisis can be defined as any unplanned event,
occurrence or sequence of events that has a specific
undesirable consequence.

Natural disasters, financial manipulation, societal
disruption, pollution, and stringent regulations are but
a few examples of potential crisis situations. The
reasons for focusing on these issues may result from a
commitment to protect the public, your employees, to
comply with government regulations or to protect the firm
from possible liabilities and litigation. The
consequences for not focusing on these issues can be
disastrous.
Ask yourself why do we need a crisis management program
with an "all hazards" approach? Put simply, such a
program allows you to provide for:
* Effective coordination of activities among the
organizations having a management/response role

* Early warning and clear instructions to all concerned
if a crisis occurs * Continued assessment of actual and
potential consequences of the crisis
* Continuity of business operations during and
immediately after the crisis
A brief synopsis of the common weaknesses in crisis
management planning may prove helpful. As you read the
discussion on the four basic elements, keep these
weaknesses in mind. You may also want to assess your
current crisis management program against these
weaknesses. The most common weaknesses in crisis
management planning are:
* No systematic collection of planning information. This
includes such aspects as hazard analysis, organizational
information, regulatory guidance, company policy
procedures and location-specific data.

* No systematic dissemination of planning information.
You've assembled a wealth of information and have not
shared it with the effected population--those whose
responsibility it is to implement the plan.

* Failure to identify and establish an incident command
structure. This is a common pitfall as many planners try
to fit their organization into a standard incident
command system not designed around their particular
needs.

* Minimal coordination with effected entities. Poor
communications with the community, neighboring
industries, and identified support entities (fire,
police, hospitals, etc.) can lead to confusion and chaos
during an emergency. A simple oversight, such as failure
to designate a primary contact for offsite agencies
during an emergency, can cause major disruption during an
incident.

* Lack of, or poorly defined, organizational
responsibilities. Failure to provide clear, concise
procedures defining a person's functions, duties, and
tasks upon assuming their emergency organization
position. This weakness can lead to finger
pointing--"It's not my responsibility!"--"I thought it
was yours!"

* Once developed, the program is poorly maintained. Your
program was developed to meet a regulatory requirement.
Why should you test it? You're not planning on having any
accidents! Often, there is no provision for continued
evaluation and periodic update of the material.
Frequently, changed material, such as telephone numbers
are buried in various paragraphs throughout the plan.

* The material you developed is not user-friendly. Your
plan contains information--lots of it. Unfortunately, the
user has to be a brain surgeon to figure out his/her role
in its implementation. You did not provide simple,
easy-to-use supplemental materials that can be used as a
quick reference guide during an emergency. Worse yet, you
didn't train anyone on the plan and their role in its
implementation.

* You did not disseminate the plan to the proper
authorities. Failure to include appropriate parties on
the distribution list most often leads to failure on
their part to respond in the manner you had hoped for.

The Plan

You may think that it is too difficult and time consuming
to develop a cohesive crisis management program. However,
when broken down into its basic elements, a plan consists
of only four parts. These are:

*Compliance
*Preparedness
*Training
*Information Management

Although no two crisis management programs are exactly
alike, these are the critical aspects of any plan. We
will discuss each of these aspects briefly.
COMPLIANCE

How do you reduce the vulnerability posed by potential
crises? A system that will advise you of the initiatives
to be addressed is needed. This will allow you to act in
a responsible manner to fulfill the purpose and intent of
existing legislation.
It can also provide a framework for anticipating future
legislation. An effective system for compliance can be
developed only if you know what laws and regulations
pertain to your operation. In order to accomplish this
task, a survey of all operations should be undertaken.
The survey should include:

*General Administrative Information
*Management Awareness and Control Programs
*Identification of Hazards/Potential Crises
*Business Characterization

The ultimate benefits to be gained from this type of
survey are in terms of identifying areas in need of
attention, establishing a list of potential crisis
situations, determining what commitments you are
comfortable with, and documenting current efforts. Once
the survey program has been developed and implemented, it
must be evaluated and kept up-to-date. This can be
accomplished by reviewing actual responses, and by
conducting a detailed audit of each element of the
business.

The survey program is the initial step, toward reducing
vulnerability. Next, you must organize the operation. The
management chain is critical to this process. You must
ensure that all levels of management become part of the
program. This can be achieved in several ways:

* Make a senior manager directly responsible to top
management and the board of directors. The formal
assignment of a senior manager to the position of "Crisis
Management Programs, Director," or some other appropriate
title, can accomplish the initial portion of this item.
Additionally, you will want to establish within the
individual's job description some measurement standard to
evaluate performance. This goes both ways. Upper
management has to take responsibility for developing
measurable and attainable goals for the Program Director
to achieve.

* Set aside specific time for reports on crisis
management preparedness issues. This can be accomplished
by preparing an agenda for senior staff and board of
director meetings that includes a discussion of crisis
management preparedness as a mandatory item. You have to
give it more than lip service, though. Also, you must
make the discussion substantive. Provide more than the
dull and tiring statistics on reportable accidents, etc.
Include all levels of personnel in the presentation
process. This can be very effective and it gets the
message out to all personnel that your company is serious
about crisis management preparedness.

* Make crisis management planning issues part of the
strategic planning process. In one aspect, government
regulations are defining strategic implications for
companies. Additionally, for publicly held companies,
Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), in the section of
the annual report entitled, "Management Analysis and
Discussion," requires a discussion of potential
liabilities. Another perspective on this issue really
begets changing the "corporate culture," i.e., making
crisis management preparedness a part of the way you do
business.

* Communicate compliance through all levels of the
organization using company policy and procedures. This
can be accomplished through formal adoption of policy at
the highest levels of the company. Generally, this will
require the approval of the Board of Directors. It is
essential, however, that companies become more aware of
their responsibilities in these areas--and this is one
way to build the awareness.
This discussion is limited by the space available to a
brief highlight of some approaches that can be
undertaken. Each company will find its situation and
circumstances to be unique to its corporate culture.
Whatever the case, however, an in-depth analysis of your
company's operating environment should be undertaken
before developing a program or attempting to address the
above items.

PREPAREDNESS

Preparedness used in the broadest context means any and
all measures taken to prevent, prepare for, respond,
mitigate, and recover from a crisis. It's with this
perspective that we begin to breakdown the aspect of
preparedness. There are four critical aspects:
*Preparation and Prevention
*Detection and Classification
*Response and Mitigation
*Reentry and Recovery

*Preparation and Prevention: Any set of activities that
prevent a crisis, reduce the chance of a crisis
happening, or reduce the damaging effects of a crisis.
Preparation and prevention activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Development and implementation of the crisis management
program
* Development and implementation of crisis management
plan implementing procedures
* Development and implementation of crisis
management/response training
*Detection and Incident Classification: Actions taken to
identify, assess, and classify the severity of a crisis.
Detection and classification activities include, but are
not limited to:

* Activation of crisis management systems
* Activation of crisis management plan implementing
procedures * Activation of the crisis management/response
organization
*Response and Mitigation: Actions taken to save lives,
prevent further damage and reduce the effects of the
crisis. Response and mitigation activities include, but
are not limited to:

* Crisis management/response organization operations
* Affiliated crisis management/response organizations'
operations * Continuity of business operations

*Reentry and Recovery: Actions taken to return to a
normal or an even safer situation following the crisis.
Reentry and recovery activities include, but are not
limited to:
* Activation of the reentry and recovery organization
* Coordination with affiliated recovery organizations
* Activation of the reentry and recovery plan

TRAINING AND RETRAINING

Training of personnel is the third component of the "all
hazards" approach. The training of the crisis
management/response organization is one of the critical
success factors that must be addressed if an adequate
response is to be achieved. The development of the
compliance program, involvement of all levels of
management, and establishing preparedness is only part of
the overall process. To ensure an adequate response, a
trained organization is required. A "systems" approach to
preparing effective training programs should consist of:

Task Analysis: When designing an integrated training
program, first determine the skills, knowledge, and
procedures required for satisfactory performance of each
task.
Lesson Development: Learning objectives are defined from
the skills, knowledge, and procedures developed during
task analysis. Instructional plans are then prepared to
support the learning objectives.

Instruction: Lessons are systematically presented using
appropriate instructional methods. Instruction may
include lecture, self-paced or group-paced mediated
instruction, simulation, and team training.

Evaluation: Performance standards and evaluation criteria
are developed from the learning objectives. Each
trainee's performance is evaluated during the course and
during field performance testing.

In addition to the formal training program, a program of
proficiency demonstration is also needed. This can be
accomplished by establishing a program that supplements
the training with drills and exercises. The drill program
can vary in degree of complexity.
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

The need to establish and maintain an ongoing dynamic
crisis management program is essential. The crisis
management process doesn't end just because you finished
the crisis management plan, are in compliance, have
involved management, and trained the staff.
In order to facilitate planning requirements, a record of
all initiatives should be retained. These records serve
to document the accomplishments, requirements,
commitments, and reports relating to various program
requirements. The identification of commitments in the
areas of compliance, emergency preparedness, and training
is vital. The establishment of a defined information
management system structure will ensure that
documentation will be available when needed.

Senior management must be kept well-informed. Information
is a corporate asset. Information is expensive and it
must be shared and managed effectively. Information
management is also critical during a crisis. The need for
active systems to provide information on materials,
personnel, capabilities information on materials,
personnel, capabilities, and processes is essential. It
is extremely important to have a system (and adequate
back-up systems) in place that serves to identify,
catalog, set priorities, and track issues and commitments
relating to crisis management and response activities.
Conclusion

In almost every instance of successful response to a
crisis, management and response activities consisting of
sound operating execution, coupled with superior
communication, predominate. Operational response is
essential. It saves lives, property, and other assets.
The ability to communicate is no less important. It saves
the business.
The simple fact is: perception is reality. Public
perception of your company's reaction to a crisis is as
important as your operating response. Lessons learned in
crises ranging from Three Mile Island nuclear crisis to
the Exxon Valdez oil spill validate the need for a
dynamic crisis management program.

Trust and confidence in the abilities of middle level
management must be established. "How well have my people
prepared?" This question can only be answered
satisfactorily if you have established a level of trust
and confidence, can communicate risk, and are willing to
allow these managers to practice upward management--that
is to delegate up. They must have the ability to
recognize needs and have a process in place that allows
them to delegate up without fear of repercussions.

Few crises will be as dramatic as Three Mile Island or
the Valdez ... unless it is your own. When your crisis
occurs, the hardest part of dealing with it can involve
answering the public call for information--a call
personified by a television correspondent or newspaper
reporter who shows up at your doorstep or on your
telephone line to get the story. How well you respond
depends on how well you are prepared.

HEROES: The US Government's Counterterrorism Rewards
Program by Jack Plaxe

The United States government has many resources at its
disposal which can be used in the fight against
terrorism. Various political, military, and diplomatic
options first come to mind, but there is one that is more
successful--the Counterterrorism Rewards Program of the
Diplomatic Security Service of the US Department of
State. Over the years this program has resulted in the
prevention of numerous terrorist attacks as well as the
apprehension of some of the world's most infamous
terrorists.
The Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program was established in
1984 by the Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public
Law 98-533. In 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security
was legislatively mandated to administer the program
under Public Law 99-399, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security
and Anti-Terrorism Act. While the Bureau of Diplomatic
Security is responsible for the day to day operations of
the program, it does so with policy guidance from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism.
Under the Rewards Program, individuals approach the State
Department with information regarding planned terrorist
attacks or details about past incidents.  If a
determination is made that the information provided is
useful, the cooperating individual will be given a
monetary reward. Rewards totaling millions of dollars
have been paid in more than twenty cases. Innocent lives
have been saved and terrorists have been apprehended,
arrested, and put behind bars.

These rewards are substantial. While the program
initially offered rewards up to $500,000, the maximum has
since been increased to $2 million. The only exception to
this is in the case of information provided that prevents
an attack against US civil aviation. In this case,
matching gifts raise the rewards to as high as $4
million.
In addition to providing monetary rewards, the State
Department can also help the cooperating individuals and
their immediate family members relocate to a safe
country.  If the individuals choose to come to the United
States, they can be afforded protection by the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security or placed into the US Marshals
Service Federal Witness Security Program, depending on
the specific situation.
Interagency Rewards Committee

The Director of the Diplomatic Security Service chairs an
interagency committee that identifies reward candidates
and recommends rewards to the Secretary of State. This
committee, known as the Interagency Rewards Committee, is
comprised of representatives from the White House
National Security Council staff, the Central Intelligence
Agency, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
US Marshals Service Witness Security Program, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Department of Energy, and
the Department of State.

The Interagency Rewards Committee is tasked with
determining which terrorist incidents merit inclusion in
the Program and the amounts that will be paid for
specific information. The Counterterrorist Rewards
Program is currently offering rewards for information
leading to the apprehension or capture of terrorists who
are responsible for some of the most deadly terrorist
attacks against both America and the international
community. These attacks include:

*The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - on December 21, 1988,
terrorists destroyed Pan American flight 103 while it was
overflying Lockerbie, Scotland. The aircraft carried 259
citizens from 30 nations, including 189 Americans.
Another 11 citizens of Lockerbie perished on the ground
from the falling debris.

*The bombing of the World Trade Center - on February 26,
1993, a terrorist vehicle bomb detonated under the World
Trade Center in New York City. This attack killed six
innocent people, injured over 1,000 others, and trapped
terrified school children in a smoke-filled elevator for
hours.

*The AK-47 assault at CIA Headquarters - on January 25,
1993, Mir Aimal Kansi allegedly murdered two people and
seriously injured three others by firing an AK-47 assault
rifle into cars waiting at a stoplight near a gate the
CIA headquarters in Virginia.
*The hijacking of TWA Flight 847 - on June 13, 1985
terrorists from Hizballah hijacked TWA Flight 847. During
a violent rampage against passengers and crew, they beat
Navy Seabee Robert Stethem to death, then dumped his dead
body onto the tarmac.
*The bombing of TWA Flight 840 - on April 2, 1986, a bomb
detonated inside the passenger cabin of TWA Flight 840,
killing nine-month-old Demetra Stylian Klug, giving her
the distinction of being one of the youngest victims of
international terrorism.
*The kidnapping and murder of Americans in Lebanon -
During the 1980s, kidnapped American citizens were held
hostage in various locations throughout Lebanon. For long
and painful years, they were chained in the dark, beaten,
and denied medical care. Three were murdered during their
captivity.

These incidents represent some of the worst terrorist
attacks directed against the United States and the
international community. As such, it is only fitting that
the Rewards Program be used to see that the parties
responsible for the attacks are brought to justice.
Rewards Program Successes: An Emphasis on Prevention

During the first four years of the program, the State
Department offered specific rewards for information
leading to the arrest or conviction of those responsible
for specific terrorist attacks. After the bombing of Pan
Am 103 in December 1988, however, new emphasis was placed
on provisions of the law which allowed for payment of
rewards in cases where information led to the
"prevention, frustration, or favorable resolution of
terrorist attacks against United States persons."

Specific reward amounts for particular terrorist
incidents were no longer announced.  Instead, the
Secretary of State was authorized to pay for information
regarding any past, present, or planned future act of
terrorism. This policy reaped benefits during Operation
Desert Storm, during which the Rewards Program was
heavily publicized.
At the start of the Persian Gulf War, an informant in an
East Asian country came forward with alarming information
about a series of terrorist attacks planned by the Iraqi
intelligence service. The terrorists had already surveyed
their intended targets and acquired automatic weapons,
grenades, and high explosives for the attack. The
assaults  were beyond the planning stage and about to be
carried out.
One of the attacks, a planned terrorist bombing and
machine-gunning of airline ticket counters at a major
airport, was scheduled to be carried out within 48 hours.
The cooperating individual provided information which was
essential in thwarting the attacks.  As a result of the
timely receipt of this intelligence information, the
terrorists were stopped by the efforts of US and host
nation authorities. Had the planned attacks proceeded as
planned, many Americans and citizens of our coalition
partners would certainly have been murdered.

The informant and immediate family were relocated to a
safe location within the United States and given a reward
of approximately $500,000 for coming forward and
providing information that saved lives.

Pan Am Flight 103 Investigation

In the course of the Pan Am 103 investigation, forensic
evidence came to light that indicated that Libya was
behind the attack. In November of 1991, indictments were
issued for two Libyans who allegedly routed the suitcase
containing the bomb through the baggage system in Malta.
The two suspects, Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel Basset
Al-Megrahi, were allegedly Libyan intelligence agents who
worked undercover for Libyan Arab Airlines at the airport
in Malta.

In 1990, a Libyan by the name of Abu Maged Jiacha
defected to the United States.  Jiacha claimed to work
with the two Pan Am 103 bombing suspects at the airport
in Malta. He claims to have had knowledge of their bomb
plans and is believed to have provided investigators with
Fhimah's diary which allegedly contains a handwritten
notation linking him to the attack.

While Jiacha has been said to have provided information
on the Pan Am 103 case to the US government, it is
unclear if this was done through the Rewards Program.
However, he is currently a government witness in the
Federal Witness Security Program. While the two Pan Am
103 bombing suspects remain in Libya, there is little
doubt that Jiacha will play an important role in any
future criminal trial. When that trial may occur is
anyone's guess.

World Trade Center Bombing

On February 26, 1993, international terrorists launched a
bombing attack in downtown Manhattan. A large improvised
explosive device concealed in a cargo van was detonated
in the subterranean garage of the 110-story World Trade
Center complex. It was later learned from one of the
captured terrorists that the intention of the bombing was
to collapse one or both of the twin towers with hopes of
killing tens of thousands of innocent people.

Fortunately, the terrorists did not succeed.  However,
the bomb did destroy the underground parking facility and
resulted in the death of six innocent people and injuries
to over 1,000 others.  Some of the victims in this attack
were young school children who had been visiting the
Trade Center on a class field trip. As smoke from the
explosion billowed upwards, the terrified children were
trapped in one of the tower's elevator for hours.

Some of the terrorists suspected of involvement of the
World Trade Center bombing were quickly apprehended but
others managed to avoid capture. Suspected terrorists
Abdul Rahman Yasin and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef fled the United
States following the bombing. After indictments were
issued for the two, the United States launched a massive
international manhunt for the fugitives. Wanted posters
offering up to $2 million rewards for information leading
to their capture were distributed in a variety of
languages. Multi-language leaflets containing the reward
offers were also sent throughout the world. Even
matchbooks containing photos of the fugitives were
distributed.
In early February, a South African student living in
Pakistan approached security officials at the US embassy
and told them that he knew where Ramzi Ahmed Yousef was
hiding. Yousef was immediately put under 24-hour
surveillance to ensure that he would not manage to escape
a second time. On February 8, 1995 American and Pakistani
authorities moved in on and arrested Yousef. He was
quickly extradited to the United States, where he is
currently awaiting trial in a New York City detention
facility.  It is believed that the student tipped off
American authorities after he had seen a Rewards Program
matchbook with Yousef's photo.

Before his arrest in Pakistan, Yousef was busy planning
and carrying out terrorist attacks in Asia. He is
allegedly responsible for the bombing of Philippine
Airlines flight 434 which resulted in the death of
26-year-old Japanese engineer Haruki Ikegama. This attack
was reportedly a trial run for a simultaneous bombing
attack on eleven American air carriers operating in the
Pacific Rim. Fortunately, Yousef was forced to flee the
Philippines before the attack could be carried out.

Four Million Reasons to prevent Terrorism

While the Counterterrorism Rewards Program has certainly
enjoyed a number of successes over the years, not all of
the details of these successes are publicly available.
The reason for this is that in order for the program to
remain successful, it must continue to attract people who
have a knowledge of the activities of the terrorist
underworld. In order for these people to come forward,
they must be assured of complete confidentiality to
prevent any possible retaliation against them or their
families.  The result of this necessary secrecy is that
the work of the security specialists who work on the
Counterterrorism Rewards Program often goes unnoticed.

According to Diplomatic Security Special Agent Brad
Smith, who administers the program, the lack of
recognition can sometimes be frustrating. However, he has
been  pleased with the public recognition that the
program has received.  In fact, Smith was recently
honored by Tom Brokaw for the work that he has done over
the years to build and nurture the Rewards Program.

In 1990, the State Department forged a unique
public-private partnership with the Air Transport
Association of America and the Air Line Pilots
Association, International. Each organization has agreed
to pledge up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2
million reward paid by the US government for information
that prevents a terrorist act against US civil aviation
or leads to the arrest and conviction of any person who
has committed such an act.  This has resulted in a
maximum reward of up to $4 million in such cases.

This supplemental program came about largely through the
joint efforts of Special Agent Brad Smith and former Pan
American Airline pilot Bruce Smith (no relation). Captain
Smith, whose wife Ingrid was killed in the Pan Am flight
103 bombing, decided to immediately accept Pan American's
settlement offer of $100,000. He tried to convince other
family members who lost loved ones to do likewise so that
they could pool their money to offer a substantial reward
for the capture of the responsible parties. Unfortunately
for Captain Smith, few families followed suit.
After this minor setback, Smith undertook efforts to
lobby the Bush administration and airline trade
organizations to strengthen the Rewards Program. Smith
approached the Air Line Pilot's Association and the Air
Transport Association and convinced them to each pledge
up to $1 million to supplement the existing $2 million
government reward. The reward of $4 million was to be
used in the Pan Am 103 case and other cases involving
terrorist attacks against civil aviation. This $4 million
reward level remains in effect today.

The US government's standing reward offer of up to $2
million applies in all cases not addressed by this unique
partnership agreement. However, Captain Smith and his
attorney Mark Zaid are currently undertaking efforts to
expand the government partnership with private sector
funding sources through the newly created, not-for-profit
Foundation to Combat International Terrorism. The
foundation's main goal would be to provide grants to
supplement the rewards distributed by the Rewards
Program. This would allow the $4 million award level to
be offered outside the sphere of civil aviation and
hopefully entice more people to come forward with useful
information.
According to Zaid, the foundation was created in order to
expand upon the current Rewards Program activities in a
number of areas. For instance, Zaid explained that the
Foundation could assist in publicizing the Rewards
Program in key countries and regions without some of the
political constraints that currently restrain US efforts.
In addition, the foundation would also assist by allowing
the program to provide rewards to those states which
cooperate by providing timely intelligence information to
the United States that prevents terrorist activity. At
the present, states are not eligible to receive rewards
for information under the Rewards Program.

However, the Foundation to Combat International Terrorism
has met with some resistance within certain offices of
the State Department. Elements within the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security support the concept and goals of the
Foundation and have actively supported the idea.
Opposition to the foundation has come primarily from the
Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, headed by
Ambassador Philip Wilcox.
In a letter to Mark Zaid dated October 16, Ambassador
Wilcox and Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security
Anthony Quainton wrote that the State Department has
decided not to work with the Foundation because of the
"possible appearance of conflict of interest."

However, this is merely an excuse given to de-emphasize
the real reason for State's decision not to become
involved in the Foundation's work. According to the
letter, Wilcox and Quainton explain that "even as a
separate legal entity the Foundation cannot effectively
be distinguished from your own activities." This is a
reference to Zaid's work to revise the Foreign Sovereign
Immunity law which currently protects state sponsors of
terrorism from legal action by individual United States
citizens. Zaid and others are trying to get changes to
the law which would allow for Americans who have been the
victim of state-sponsored terrorism to have recourse
through the US legal system. The State Department is not
in favor of such revisions to the Sovereign Immunity law
because it would effectively undermine State's ability to
manage foreign relations, a power which it jealously
guards.

Efforts to Publicize the Rewards Program

The State Department maintains an ongoing public affairs
campaign to promote greater awareness of the Rewards
Program. This campaign includes efforts to both inform
the American public about the Rewards Program as well as
to disseminate information regarding available rewards to
those who might have information. Towards these ends,
advertisements have been placed to promote the program in
a variety of media. Print ads in English, Arabic,
Spanish, French, German, and Russian have appeared in
publications as diverse as The New York Times, Al Hayat,
Paris Match, Die Welt, and Pravda. Additionally, public
service announcements featuring entertainment
personalities Charlton Heston, Charles Bronson, and
Charlie Sheen have been widely distributed.
Charlton Heston  "... Real life heroes are ordinary
people who do extraordinary things for their fellow
man--like warning of acts of political violence that
could endanger innocent lives!"

Charles Bronson "... Persons with information about an
act of terrorism can be a hero by saving innocent lives.
The US government, along with associations of pilots and
airlines, is offering up to $4 million dollars for such
information."
Charlie Sheen  "... Confidentiality and protection can be
assured for these heroic people. Are you the next hero?"

In 1994, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program also went
on the Internet. The global reach of the Internet is
ideal for distributing information about the Rewards
Program. According to Special Agent Smith, "several
thousand" messages from people from 68 countries have
been sent to the HEROES electronic mailbox. The address
for the Heroes electronic mailbox is: heroes@clark.net.

At around the same time, the Rewards Program also
launched a site on the Internet's World Wide Web. This
format is useful for the HEROES page because it allows
the State Department to include text about the program,
sound clips of some of the radio and television spots,
and photos of the wanted terrorists. According to Special
Agent Smith, over 250,000 people have downloaded
information from the Heroes World Wide Web site. The URL
for the Heroes Web site is:
http://www.clark.net/pub/heroes/.
Of course, the Counterterrorism Rewards Program can also
be contacted through more traditional channels as well.
Anyone who has information that could be of use by the
Diplomatic Security Service can call a number which is
staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by State
Department security personnel. That number is:
1-800-HEROES-1  [1-800-437-6371].

The Rewards Program can also be contacted by mail at :

New Terrorism: The Shape of Things to Come by Harvey W.
Kushner, Ph.D.

As we approach the twenty-first century, law-enforcement
authorities will face a number of complicated issues.
Among the most troublesome is the continuing threat of
Middle Eastern terrorism. Although overshadowed by the
blast at the Oklahoma City Federal Center, the World
Trade Center bombing illustrates the seriousness of the
problem. Unfortunately, it is no longer feasible to rely
on past experiences with terrorism as a guide to
implementing future policy. Recent world events have so
altered Middle Eastern terrorism that we now face a
potentially more dangerous adversary that requires us to
rethink and formulate new tactics and strategies.

Out with the Old

The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived the tightly
organized, centrally directed, and usually secular
networks of sophisticated Middle Eastern terrorists of
money, weapons, and safe-havens. Aid from Eastern Europe
dried up as well. Even Syria and Libya, also traditional
sources of money and weaponry, have been lying low
knowing that they can no longer get backing in any
confrontation with the United States from a Soviet Bloc
that no longer exists.

Yasser Arafat himself contributed to the decline in the
old terrorism by making the tactical mistake of siding
with Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. After the Iraqi
defeat, Arafat could no longer expect his Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) to be the recipient of a
form of protection money from the rich and vulnerable oil
states. Just at the same time the oil money stopped
flowing, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) cut much-needed financial aid to Palestinian
refugees in the occupied territories. With financial
support on the decline, Arafat's competition, Hamas (the
violent wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement) stepped
up its campaign to discredit his leadership. It is even
arguable that Arafat's troubles moved him to the peace
table with Israel before any fall from power.

The Gulf War also crippled Iraq's worldwide network of
terrorist's activities. Add to this the demise of a
terrorist network run from Tripoli and coordinated by
so-called diplomats operating out of Libyan embassies
around the world. Cuba, Syria, and Algeria also withdrew
from openly encouraging and supporting terrorists. In
short, these traditional actors and sponsors of terrorism
are either so damaged that they have no alternative but
to withdraw from their activities or are trying to
cultivate a new, more diplomatic image.
Credit is also due to the efforts of American
intelligence agencies and other foreign groups in their
proactive counterterrorist activities. These agencies
were instrumental in curtailing the activities of many
terrorist groups like the Red Army faction in Germany and
the Red Brigades in Italy. These left-wing groups were
supportive of the PLO and other secular terrorist groups.

In With the New

A new support center for terrorism in Iran emerged after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini toppled the Shah in 1979.
Iran immediately set out to export and finance it's
militant fundamentalist message throughout the Muslim
world. It supported militant Islamic fundamentalist
movements in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Sudan.
The impoverished Sudan provided Iran with its first
success. Nearly a decade after the Iranian revolution a
group of military officers and mullahs seized power in
Sudan installing the first Sunni Muslim republic. Sheik
Hassan al-Turabi, the Sorbonne-educated spiritual leader
of Sudan's Sunni Muslims, offered an olive branch to the
Shiite Muslims of Iran. The charismatic Turabi is
committed to ending the bitter historic enmity that has
separated Sunni and Shiite since the seventh century. He
has already been successful in bringing to Khartoum a
series of summit-type meetings with a variety of militant
Islamic fundamentalist groups and terrorist leaders.
Together these leaders have endorsed a terrorist
manifesto containing Machiavellian prescripts for
advancing militant Islamic fundamentalism.

The Shiite Muslim republic of Iran and it's Sunni Muslim
allies in Sudan have pooled their resources. Together
they hope to "Islamize" the Muslim world while embarking
on a systematic campaign of sponsoring international
terrorism. The linchpin of this partnership is oil-rich
Iran which supplies the finances, arms, and trainers from
the Revolutionary Guards and the secret army unit known
as Quds Force. Sudan's contributions to the partnership
include sanctuaries for terrorists and a series of
terrorist camps maintained by Sudan's Popular Defense
Forces (a quasi-military body modeled after Iran's
Revolutionary Guards).

The New Terrorist

Typically, young, uneducated, and unskilled, the new
terrorists come to these Sudanese camps directly from a
life of poverty and repression. They enter with a strong
belief in Islam as the way out of their dismal social
situation. Their militant Islamic fundamentalism is
reinforced by Islamic radicals versed in Koranic studies
and terrorist tactics they learned when fighting
alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan. Unfortunately,
the decade-long war against communism waged by the
mujaheddin in fighters turned Afghanistan into a boot
camp for terrorists. Many of the Islamic radicals who
went to do battle against the Soviets wound up experts in
bomb-making and other terrorist tactics. These
troublemakers are now training other Islamic recruits in
terrorist camps throughout Sudan.

Do not be misled into thinking that the absence of
sophisticated training places these students of terror at
a disadvantage. Rather, their religious zeal makes them
more dangerous than the secular, often Marxist-inspired,
Middle Eastern terrorists of the past. Harder to combat
as well. Why? Because they are able to carry out their
terror with more readily available and less-sophisticated
devices. They need not wait for the delivery of high-tech
explosives. They need only consult a number of anarchist
"cookbooks" for the proper ingredients which are in
supply in a wide variety of hardware stores. Look for a
mixture of nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil rather than
plastic explosives such as Semtex or C-4.

Less sophisticated also means less organized than their
secular predecessors, and consequently more difficult to
spot, track, and intercept. In the past, universities
were not only centers for recruiting terrorists but
places that provided sanctuary for networks of terrorists
to organize and spout their terrorist rhetoric. It is
much harder for today's law enforcement agencies to
infiltrate groups that are not organized in any
systematic way.
The new terrorists are easily inspired by religious
beliefs and the suggestions of their spiritual leaders.
The alleged involvement of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar
Abdel Rahman, in the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt and the World Trade Center explosion
illustrates the power that a spiritual leader can have on
the actions of these new terrorists. Sheik Rahman's
blindness contributes to his credibility since blind
reciters of the Koran are respected in Islamic societies
for their heightened sensitivity for memorization. It is
often the case that the loss of one sense is compensated
by an increase in another.

Inspiration can also lead to freelance terrorism that
occurs with regularity throughout the Middle East,
especially in Israel. We often read of how a Palestinian
with no history of terrorist activity or group
affiliation randomly stabs or axes an Israeli on the
streets of Tel Aviv. These freelance terrorists are
devoutly religious, highly impressionable, and given to
suggestion. Their acts are almost impossible to
predict--except that they are bound to occur given the
call to fanaticism that echoes through the impoverished
societies of the Middle East.

These new terrorists travel freely throughout the entire
Muslim world. They walk the streets of Pakistan and
congregate in the suburbs of Cairo. The World Trade
Center bombing and the aborted plot to bomb a number of
other landmarks in New York should tell us that they are
here with their well-documented penchant for taking
matters into their own hands. We can count on them to
take action--and we should understand that they will.

What to do?

The new world order has already impacted on our local
law-enforcement agency's ability to protect and serve.
Future occurrences in international politics will do the
same. Today's local law enforcement agencies must
constantly monitor a changing world for potential
terrorism and its likely impact on domestic security.
Today's militant Islamic fundamentalists cannot be
ignored; in fact, it would be wise for all of us to
become familiar with the aspirations of the more than one
billion Muslims worldwide. We have already witnessed a
veritable explosion in the number of individuals
subscribing to the Islamic faith right here in America.

The overwhelming majority of Muslims abhor terrorism.
Nevertheless, we must not be afraid to ask questions of
those who do not. But to make certain that the right
questions are asked, it makes sense to give our law
enforcement personnel cultural diversity training. That
way, there will be fewer problems stemming from any lack
of understanding. After all, there is no way to get
around the fact that millions of Muslims live in the
United States or have regular contacts here either
through family or business. Mutual understanding is the
first step toward countering terrorism.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part I

When Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa much
of the world breathed a sigh of relief. Here was a man
who promised a new future to a country long plagued by
racial strife and increasing instability. But there is
also a dark side to the bright future, for beneath South
Africa's youthful democratic face lurks a potentially
deadly disease: the specter of organized crime.

Of course, this is a scourge that afflicts much of the
world today. International crime organizations operate
relatively freely around the globe, reaping huge profits
from the proceeds of their illegal activities and taking
advantage of new technology to insert themselves covertly
into the machinery of national economies. The World Bank
reports that some of these "crime empires" are now worth
far more than the gross domestic products of all the
Middle Eastern and North African countries combined. The
opportunities being presented to international crime
organizations for worldwide illegal operations are
greater today than they have been since the end of World
War II. Over the past five years, international gangs
have greatly benefitted from the changes brought about by
the breakup of the Soviet Union, the introduction of
computerized international banking and finance, and the
general trend toward free trade.
In South Africa this trend is particularly apparent.
Hiding behind burgeoning local crime, South African
syndicates are growing larger all the time, a new
manifestation of the problems which have affected the
United States and the rest of the world in the post-Cold
War period.

Like South Africa, the United States has traditionally
felt that its oceans, great distances, and national
borders provide separation and safety from international
crime. However, the globalization of communications,
transportation, trade, and finance has globalized crime.
The same conditions and mechanisms that support the
expansion of free markets are just as well suited to
bolster the so-called "Four Horsemen of International
Crime"--four key criminal activities that have the
capability to wreak havoc with democratic countries.
These four corrosive factors are: organized crime, drugs,
illicit financial activity, and transportation crime.

In South Africa, the recent movement to political
pluralism, the development of a market economy, and the
end of Soviet and Cuban military intervention in
neighboring countries have provided a new source of hope
for the Southern African region, but it has also enticed
the world's criminal organizations to take advantage of
the opportunities that the new situations provide. From a
US perspective, South Africa's dramatic change and
progress over the past several years must not be given up
to the international gangs that are currently flocking to
southern Africa.

According to South African Police Services (SAPS)
sources, approximately 500 well-armed and financed
organized crime syndicates are now operating in South
Africa. These powerful gangs--some domestic, some from
neighboring African countries, and some from the well
known and powerful international criminal
organizations--are capable of buying and burrowing their
way into public institutions and terrorizing the public
and the South African business community.

The majority of South African gangs are involved in drug
trafficking (136), followed by vehicle theft (112), and
commercial crime (85). Police say that the activities of
the various gangs are closely linked. For example motor
vehicle theft, truck hijacking and robbery are linked to
the illegal arms trade in Mozambique, while drug
trafficking is connected with motor vehicle theft in
Zambia as well as to money laundering and check kiting
schemes.

The US government has important interests in South Africa
that will be adversely affected by the unchecked growth
of these international crime syndicates. American
interests are essentially based on promoting a
democratic, secure, and prosperous South Africa. South
Africa's success in dealing with the various syndicates
will depend partly on reinforcement by the United States
in countering the insidious actions of international
crime organizations--drug smuggling, money laundering,
and their illegal theft and trade activities.

International Criminal Organizations

The world's traditional criminal gangs and mafias are
groups whose primary objective is to gain money and power
by carrying out illegal activities. Organized crime
groups that used to operate only nationally in their own
domestic arena are now forging new global ties and moving
beyond traditional drugs, arms smuggling, and
prostitution into new areas such as trade in nuclear
technology, transport of illegal aliens, and money
laundering.

International gangs are estimated to turn over some $750
billion a year from drug smuggling and other illegal
activities. Organized crime and the financial frauds they
perpetrate are currently considered to be the most
pervasive and sophisticated threats that businesses must
face. A recent survey of top British executives showed
that 55 percent of respondents said they believe the risk
of syndicate fraud will increase in 1995, compared with
only 29 percent who predicted political instability will
increase.
What caused this? Largely the decline of border controls
in Europe and the removal of the severe travel
restrictions that once divided Europe between east and
west. Easy access has created opportunities for the
world's major organized crime syndicates in Italy,
Russia, and Asia to work with their colleagues in South
America and the United States to expand into new markets
and to evolve into truly international crime
corporations.
Russia. The breakdown of the old Soviet police system and
the lack of centralized control in the new Russia has
allowed over 5,000 criminal syndicates to flourish, often
combining their efforts with those of the international
mafia. Russian gangs are complex organizations with
international criminal connections around the world. The
danger posed by Russian gangsters has already reached the
United States. Russians are now frequently apprehended
and put on trial alongside their criminal
associates--members of the US and Italian mafia who,
among other crimes, import large amounts of heroin into
the United States.

FBI Director Louis Freeh agrees that Russian criminal
gangs are "becoming a formidable threat." The FBI has
identified some 220 Russian gangs now operating in 17 US
cities in 14 states. Russian gangs are also established
in 29 foreign countries and maintain contacts with an
estimated 100,000 criminal enterprises around the world.
These range from sophisticated technology smuggling to
illegal immigrant smuggling rings to child prostitution
rings in China and Southeast Asia. Banks with branches in
Cyprus are reported to be handling about $1 billion a
month in laundered Russian funds, according to the
Russian Central Bank.

Actually, the FBI considers that the arrival of Russian
gangs is directly related to much of the drug-related
violence in urban America. Most Russian gangs initiate
operations in the United States by entering the country
on normal business visas and then stay on illegally when
their visas expire. The number of Russians entering the
United States has risen dramatically. In 1988 only 8,000
Soviet citizens entered, but in 1994 the number rose to
140,000.

The FBI is concerned about these large numbers of
Russians entering the country because ongoing criminal
cases show that there is a lot of involvement in
organized crime, especially in working with the Italian
Mafia to import narcotics. Last year, FBI Director Freeh
and Russia's top law enforcement officials agreed on a
cooperative program to combat organized crime, swapping
information, training and law enforcement personnel--in
Freeh's words "a police-to-police bridge."
Art collectors, police, and insurers are also
increasingly blaming organized crime--especially the
Russians and Eastern European gangs--for the rapid growth
in fine art theft in Europe. Worldwide, some $3 billion
worth of art and valuable objects are currently missing,
and much of the cause can be placed on organized crime.
Frequently, US sting operations against organized crime
gangs recover stolen art among shipments of drugs,
contraband, and stolen art.

Chinese Triads. China's triads have developed a thriving
export business that includes trade in people. Chinese
gangs may make up to $3.5 billion annually from exporting
their compatriots searching for a better life at $35,000
per head. Chinese Triads have developed a complex
international network to smuggle their refugees into the
United States and Europe with major transit points in
Russia and Latin America. The Triads have set up
operations in South Africa, and its only a matter of time
until they expand their other activities there, including
an interest in South Africa's emerging casino industry.
The New Jersey state Casino Control Commission is
currently investigating the activities of members of
Asian organized crime syndicates and reports that there
is a distinct possibility that the Asian mobsters have
infiltrated the industry. In typical understatement,
police officials have said that Chinese Triad interests
in South Africa have "become more apparent."

Taiwan. Not all illegal activity takes place in mainland
China and Hong Kong. Some opposition leaders in Taiwan
say that while their organized crime problems are hardly
new, crime families have gained influence with the
blossoming of Taiwan's democracy. The Ministry of Justice
reported in late 1994 that one-third of Taiwan's 858
elected city and county councilors have criminal records.

Japanese Yakuza. The Yakuza, Japan's principal organized
crime syndicate, has shown a remarkable ability to
respond to changing circumstances. After World War II it
did what criminals do best--straight violence. In the
late 1950s, the Yakuza turned to debt collection, and in
its next phase, the Yakuza zeroed in on the public
officials who regulated them. The high-growth 1980s
launched the gangs on a fourth phase of corporate
operations, this time focused on manipulating the stock
market, bank fraud, and real estate swindles. This
current Yakuza campaign against the business world is
on-going today, and the gangs are growing more and more
clever.
Although the Yakuza prefer to operate in a low-key
manner, it is capable of violence, as shown by the 1994
murder of Kazufumi Hatanaka, head of the Nagoya branch of
Sumitomo Bank. The Sumitomo Bank had been accused of
cutting ethical corners, and there have been a number of
complex and questionable financing transactions between
Sumitomo and underworld organizations. The Japanese
government has been clamping down on the Yakuza through
the enforcement of the Organized Crime Law of 1992, but
the gangs have shown that they are extremely difficult to
put out of business.
Fraud and Money Laundering

Employee-related fraud in South Africa is on a par with
the worst countries in the world, according to risk
insurers with Lloyd's of London, and it is seen by
international observers as being as bad as in South
American countries, such as Colombia. The frequency and
size of fraud claims in South Africa has more than
doubled in the past three years. Some players in the
local financial markets will no longer provide fidelity
guarantee cover--insurance against employee fraud--for
financial institutions. The increase in fraud claims are
blamed on higher stock values, the growing sophistication
of criminal gangs, increased computerization, and
political uncertainty. In August 1995 there was a total
of $6 billion in fraud cases under investigation by SAPS,
and some risk managers say that this is just the tip of
the iceberg.

It is the sheer volume of money that ties together the
various forms of international crime and links them all
with legal business. The US Treasury Department estimates
there is an enormous, several trillion-dollar pool of
money that dashes around in what is effectively
international cyberspace, moving by computer in and out
of offshore banks and chasing profits in 24-hour markets,
all largely beyond the reach of government control. Of
this total amount, it is estimated that there is between
$100 billion and $300 billion of dirty money circling the
globe at any one time, looking for a home, looking to
merge into the legal economy, looking for deals that may
be legal, and some that are not legal.
South Africa's banking and financial system has a
reputation as one of the world's solid professional
operations--the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is the
world's tenth largest. Yet the emergence of the new South
Africa and the transition from the previous government's
system of controls and operations has presented some
problems. As South African banks rejoined the
international business community, they arrived at a time
when illegal money laundering was at an all time high,
and crime syndicate money managers were on the lookout
for any easy opportunity to launder their cash.
Because there was no obligation for South African
financial institutions to report any suspicion of money
laundering, the banking community learned that it was a
prime target for the international crime organization's
financial networks. Banks quickly realized that this was
not a time for business as usual, and they had to react
swiftly to ensure the integrity and ethics of their
operations.

Hidden Crisis: International Crime Imperils South
Africa's Security by Edward V. Badolato Part II

Globalized money laundering is a profound challenge to
national sovereignty. Offshore banks and other means of
laundering allow businesses to evade taxes and national
regulations and provide the money to lubricate the
bribery and corruption that makes their activities
possible. This is a security threat that neither of the
traditional security responses--the legal system and
police operations--can really meet. Getting the money
laundering problem under control will require cross
border cooperation and an unprecedented degree of
cooperation between the government and the private
sector.
The US dollar is presently the currency of choice for an
increasingly powerful collection of drug lords and their
rogue financial advisors bent on manipulating the global
financial order. The financial managers for the top drug
cartels, especially the highly skilled money launderers
for the Colombian, Brazilian, and Mexican cartels, are
transferring huge quantities of funds each day around the
international banking system.
In the wake of tough US banking regulations, most drug
money laundering operations now generally involves one of
four methods: first by smuggling profits directly out of
the country by stashing them in industrial shipments or
appliances bound for Latin America where the Cali cartel
or their agent can get easy access to the cash. Second,
breaking down large amounts of cash into smaller
increments that need not be reported to federal
regulators. Third, many laundering operations set up
elaborate commercial fronts, washing the money through
complex layers of seemingly innocent transactions.
Finally, some laundering operations are unbelievably
unsophisticated as they take hundreds of thousands of
dollars to a friendly employee at the bank, fill out
deposit slips and deposit the cash. Recently a Citibank
assistant manager in New York was caught cooperating with
a worldwide group that has laundered hundreds of millions
in drug money back to Colombia.

The US government has been focusing on new technologies
and software programs that can track the flow of money in
and out of a country. For example, in the United States,
companies and banks must report cash transactions of
$10,000 or more. This information is used by the Treasury
Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FINCEN), a financial tracking organization that plays an
important role in combating money laundering crimes, as a
database to track transactions. Such anti-money
laundering operations are reported to have driven the
cost of laundering US drug proceeds from six percent in
the late 1980s to 26 percent of today's gross profits.
This has been borne out by some recent interviews with
captured drug kingpins who said that it was costing them
$260,000 to move each $1 million out of the United
States.
However, because the Treasury Department concluded that
some of the record-keeping and reporting rules in place
to stop money laundering were bureaucratic and
ineffective, and sharp cuts have been made in the
information that banks must keep on large ($10,000 and
above) cash transactions. This is not giving the
launderers a free ride, because at the same time they
removed much of the bureaucratic red tape, the Treasury
Department tightened the rules on the real problem
areas--those governing electronic money transfers among
currency exchanges, casinos, brokerage firms, and banks
to require the keeping of records about the sources and
recipients of the transfers.
Banks in other areas of the world are also improving
their oversight operations. For example, controls and
staff training has recently been introduced by the Hong
Kong Association of Banks to help its members combat
money laundering. Hong Kong is a prime target for hiding
sources of illicit funds because of its location, trading
policies and sophisticated markets.

Credit card fraud is also a serious organized crime
related problem in the United States--and it may also
become so in South Africa as that country takes on more
of the technological trappings of the Western world.
Credit card fraud losses for major card players in the
United States has increased to about $1 billion a year,
much of which is attributed to Nigerian gangs. As a
result, the credit card industry has taken drastic
measures to curb fraud and to wage war against organized
crime, which uses card fraud to finance illegal
activities. Countermeasures include use of
fraud-detection software to enable issuers to determine
if someone is making unauthorized transactions,
incorporating a unique secret code in the card's magnetic
stripe to detect altered data at the time of
authorization, new chip cards, and education on proper
card acceptance procedures.

The Drug Trade

The global drug trade's illegal income makes up the major
portion of the $750 billion taken in by the major
international crime organizations each year. Indications
are that South Africa, and in particular Johannesburg, is
rapidly becoming the southern anchor of an African drug
triangle involving Nigeria in the northwest and Sudan in
the northeast. South African customs officials are
concerned that Johannesburg International Airport (JAI)
is becoming a major distribution point for cocaine moving
to the European market.
The chief of the narcotics bureau at JAI, Colonel
Stefanus Smit, says that "the quantity of cocaine coming
through has increased at an incredible rate." Smit has
only a 13-man staff to monitor the 3,000 international
travelers per day at the airport. Police sources claim
that South American cartels are now using South African
drug couriers out of Johannesburg because they draw less
suspicion as they travel to Europe and the United States.
The South African couriers are flown to a Latin American
city, such as Rio de Janeiro, supplied with drugs, and
then flown to Nigeria or another West African country.
After a few days they travel into South Africa, taking
advantage of soft security at border crossing points.

The drug cartels operating in South Africa, like their
American counterparts, must be able to launder these
funds skillfully to pay their underlings, to run their
massive and intricate transportation systems, and to
distribute the extensive numbers of bribes required to
keep their system going.

Transportation Crime

Around the world, trade is growing twice as fast--and
foreign direct investment four times as fast--as national
economies. South Africa's transportation system is
presently in this high growth situation with increased
road traffic, increased rail shipments, and increased
maritime shipments. For example, the port of Capetown
forecasts an increase of over 50 percent in international
container shipments next year. International trade and
exports are a major factor in South Africa's economic
future. This intense competition for the growing volume
of money, goods, and services moving across borders and
through ports can place South African officials under
tremendous pressure to make sure they move the goods and
commerce swiftly, hence encouraging the relaxation of
bottlenecking regulations and controls internally and at
borders.
International crime syndicates love to work a busy
transportation system, where they can operate "in the
seams" with little chance of apprehension. We have
learned a lot about this in the United States where
international thieves have found cargo theft so
profitable and the likelihood of arrest so slight that
some gangs have switched from drug smuggling to cargo
crime. The United States has worked hard to combat cargo
theft, yet the total dollar loss from all modes of
transportation approaches $10 billion annually. If this
is the case in the United States, South Africa must take
care that its cargo operations do not become a sitting
duck for international cargo crime syndicates.
However, it appears that international crime syndicates
have already begun to focus on South Africa. Law
enforcement officials credit the increase in organized
crime in South Africa to the stricter laws and control
measures now in place at points of entry in Europe and
America, renewed international trade interest, South
Africa's strategic location astride the major Far
East-Middle East and Atlantic shipping routes, its first
world infrastructure, and its re-entry into the
international arena.
In the United States, some of the conditions that allow
international transportation crime to flourish have been
created by conscious choice. For example, at one of the
busiest Mexican border crossings, customs officials are
told to spend no more than one minute examining each
northbound tractor-trailer in order to prevent huge
12-hour traffic jams. This and other programs to speed
the cross border traffic, has been a bonanza for drug
smugglers.  Another problem is within the ranks of
transportation workers themselves. In the United States,
many instances of cargo theft involve insider cooperation
or information. In one major airport that had high theft
rates, it was discovered that at least 70 percent of the
staff that worked on the tarmac had previous arrest
records. In other areas strong unions in port areas with
high theft rates refuse to allow increased exit searches
and controls.

And while the volume of air freight is exploding, new
rules make the government liable for damage caused to
perishable goods--flowers, food, animals--by inspection
delays. So what could be more natural than to use these
same shipments, especially those moving through the
busiest airports, to smuggle drugs and other contraband?
The largest volume of air cargo in the United States
passes through busy Miami Airport. It is the gateway to
Latin America, and perishable air freight cargoes such as
flowers (82 percent of the flowers imported into the
United States originate in Colombia) pass through Miami
airport. Airport officials have had to deal with the
challenge of smuggling drug shipments in the flowers and
other cargos. Additionally, Miami is the largest port of
entry for the French perfume industry. Last year, theft
of expensive shipments of fragrances by organized crime
got so bad that an FBI Task Force had to be formed.
The US Department of Justice reported that Colombian
nationals, together with Peruvians, Ecuadoreans, and
Chileans, have formed large-scale cargo theft gangs.
Particularly with the Ecuadoreans, multi-million dollar
tractor trailer thefts of cargo were occurring at
numerous terminals all along the East Coast. When
apprehended and questioned, the thieves were found to be
members of drug cartels which switched from the illegal
drug business because they found stealing cargo safer and
easier than smuggling drugs.

Vehicle Hijacking and Theft

Because of the vacuum caused by police reorganization,
international organized crime has quickly moved into
South Africa's extensive vehicle theft operations.
According to Police Commissioner George Fivas, in 1994
over 80,000 vehicle were stolen, including a huge number
of commercial trucks and cargos. There have been 36
hijacking-related murders of drivers in the first half of
1995. The crime syndicates are currently managing to stay
one step ahead of the outgunned and undermanned police,
and are increasingly using the cross-border theft of
vehicles and cargo to finance drug shipments in a network
of criminal activity involving Lesotho, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Police have recently recovered
stolen South African vehicles as far away as Australia,
Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus.

There is some hope for the grim picture of rampant
transportation crime thanks to the determined efforts of
The Transportation Crime Sub-committee of South Africa's
National Crime Combatting Council, which was founded in
1994 to establish a partnership between the South African
police and all elements of the transportation business
sectors for the fight against transportation crime. The
American experience has shown that public and private
groups like this must have dedicated government support
if they are to be successful.

Solutions

Around the world, organized crime is rapidly expanding to
take advantage of post-Cold War opportunities.
International crime syndicates are adding to their
traditional illicit activities by using their vast
financial resources and sophisticated command of
technology to move huge amounts of ill-gotten, but
effectively laundered money around the world in seconds,
to steal sensitive proprietary information for unlawful
purposes, and to infiltrate legitimate businesses. It
appears that this trend will increase unless strong
cooperative international measures are taken.

South African police forces are currently out-gunned and
out-manned. A key factor why organized crime is
flourishing in South Africa may be because police forces
are too poorly paid and equipped to fight the
international criminal gangs taking up residence there or
to resist the corruption of overpowering financial
temptations and bribes. SAPS sources admit that they lack
the structure, resources, finances, and technical
resources to cope with large-scale organized crime. Some
organized crime groups already have state-of-the-art
equipment and communications systems, most of which puts
South African law enforcement technologies to shame.

The international criminal organizations are evolving
into a new breed of cyberspace crook.     Trends in South
Africa indicate that the top participants in future
criminal organizations will be educated, highly
sophisticated, computer-literate individuals who can
wield state-of-the-art information technology to the best
advantage, for themselves and their criminal
organizations. To be effective, law enforcement
organizations must recruit and train the same caliber of
individuals.
International economic and law enforcement organizations
are only now beginning to deal with the problem. Within
the last year a spate of international conferences on the
drug trade, bribery and official corruption have begun to
at least talk about the issues. The European Union is
setting up a Europe-wide police intelligence agency, and
the FBI has made international cooperation one of its
highest priorities. The next meeting of the Group of
Seven top industrial nations is scheduled to produce the
outline of a new economic architecture that can
collectively deal with terrorism, organized crime and
drug trafficking.

Affected countries like South Africa have begun top level
public-private efforts to combat international crime. In
South Africa, the Council of South African Bankers and
Business South Africa hosted "A Business Initiative
Against Corruption and Crime" in August 1995 that was
attended by President Nelson Mandela and most of the
top-ranking government, security, and business
executives. The conference has an ambitious action plan
which will provide a South African road map for guiding
the struggle against criminal elements.

The continuing fight against international crime
organizations will involve increased international
cooperation and new regulations to improve law
enforcement operations. Finally, countries must work
together to tighten their laws to prevent criminal
organizations from benefiting from international
loopholes. New laws should be introduced where necessary
to strengthen the hand of local law enforcers and ease
international coordination of operations against
international syndicates. States also should exchange
information and experience to increase the level of
international cooperation. South Africa is a prime
example of what can happen in other emerging democratic
countries with expanding economies.

Libya and the Pan Am 103 Bombing: The Department of
Justice Sends a Message  by Douglas Kash

On May 18, an American consultant for the nation of Libya
was arrested outside of a Washington, DC, hotel for
violating US sanctions against Libya. William Bodine was
charged for arranging meetings with executive branch
officials to help foster the normalization of relations
with the United States.

Libya refuses to release Abdel Basser Ali Al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhalmah, both suspected of planting the
explosives aboard Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.
Economic and diplomatic sanctions against Libya,
initially imposed in 1986, were broadened after the
bombing, including a provision prohibiting normalization
of relations until the suspects are extradited to Great
Britain or the United States for prosecution. According
to a supporting affidavit by a US Customs Service agent,
Bodine met on June 16, 1992, with an unnamed employee of
the Bush administration's National Security Council to
discuss the sanctions. The affidavit specifies that
others were contacted, including National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former adviser Robert
McFarlane.

Bodine also allegedly arranged a meeting between Libyan
Treasury Minister Mohammed El Bukhari and a "Texas
businessman" who sources identify as real estate
executive Trammel Crow. Bukhari had hoped that, in
addition to a Dallas land deal, the Crow family influence
might lead the way to Washington.

Authorities allege that Bodine set up a branch of the New
York-based Investment Advisory Group in the British
Virgin Islands and opened a Swiss bank account to receive
$8 million per year in separate $460,000 payments to
"consult" on behalf of Libya. A search of the Dallas
office of Bodine's son-in-law, Henry Billingsley,
allegedly uncovered a roll of undeveloped film of Bodine
at a site in Libya bombed by the United States in 1986.

In a related development, on October 17, Libya abandoned
its candidacy for the "North Africa" seat on the United
Nations Security Council, claiming that the UN had become
a tool of the United States. Arguing that it would have
been unconscionable for a state presently under UN
sanction to fill a vacancy, the United States, Britain,
and France campaigned against Libya and gathered enough
votes to prevent Libya from obtaining the two-thirds
majority of the General Assembly required to win
election.

Senate Provides More Relief for Victims of Terrorism by
Douglas Kash

On June 6, the Senate passed legislation aimed at
increasing federal powers to prevent and combat
terrorism. In a 91-8 vote Senate bill S. 735--known as
the "Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995."
Title X of the bill, "Victims of terrorism Act of 1995,"
provides that the director of the FBI is entitled to make
grants to states in order to provide compensation and
assistance to residents of those states who, while
outside the territorial boundaries of the United States,
are victims of terrorism or mass violence, but are not
otherwise eligible for compensation under the Omnibus
Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. (See,
"Where to turn? Compensating the Victims of Terrorism,"
Counterterrorism & Security, Spring 1995). They also
provided the same compensation and assistance package for
victims of domestic terrorism. The FBI director may also
provide funds to the US Attorney's office for use in
coordination with state victims compensation and
assistance efforts in providing emergency relief.
Even more recently the Senate Judiciary Committee and its
counterpart in the House offered their respective changes
to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) of 1976 to
enable victims of terrorism to sue the governments
responsible. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
generally prohibits lawsuits against a foreign country by
US citizens unless the injury is directly related to the
foreign government's business in the United States.

Distinct from the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995, the
Senate amendment to the FSIA limits the Act to countries
listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism
such as Libya, Iraq, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
The House version would permit a suit against any country
whose legal system does not offer foreigners an adequate
legal remedy, such as Saudi Arabia. Under this remedy,
victims of terrorism could win damages in US courts if
they are unable to gain compensation in the courts of the
country involved.

Sri Lanka: Terrorism in Perspective by Tom Marks

A fine line separates terrorism from forms of violence
based upon mass mobilization. The problem for security
forces is that, early on, armed challenges to government
control appear more or less the same. Hence systemic
response to "terror," normally based upon force, more
often than not is inappropriate. Most commonly, abuse of
the populace creates a new dynamic which allows an
operationally astute terrorist organization to mobilize
additional support.

It is this process which makes the ongoing struggle in
Sri Lanka of more than passing interest. Prior to the
July 1983 explosion of communal violence which serves as
the starting point for the conflict's intense phase, best
evidence indicates that the number of Tamils actually
engaged in violence amounted to no more than 50-60
hardcore individuals who traveled freely between India
and Sri Lanka. These activists were assisted by a network
of informers throughout the north. Violence was limited
to the Jaffna area, the main base of Tamil resistance
situated on the island's northern tip.
July 1983's wholesale assault upon the Tamil populace by
enraged Sinhalese mobs, combined with the inability or
unwillingness of the security forces to protect them,
proved the turning point. What might have remained a
terrorist threat exploded into insurgency. In the months
that followed, the resistance movement underwent a
dramatic expansion in strength and areas of operation. By
mid-1984 total numbers of separatists were estimated at
2,500-5,000 personnel, with probably at least half armed
and equipped. Today, insurgent strength may go as high as
15,000, with a divided, amateurish resistance having been
replaced by the well-trained, disciplined, and armed
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), or "Tigers."

How much different would the situation have been had a
force and an approach been at hand to deal correctly with
the situation!

 Background to the Conflict

Ironically, as a democracy, Sri Lanka would have seemed
theoretically positioned to address popular grievances
adequately. But following independence from Britain in
1948, the new nation's highly centralized, unitary state
ensured domination of the polity by the nearly
four-fifths majority of Buddhist, Sinhala-speaking
Sinhalese (roughly a fifth of the population were
Tamil-speaking Hindus).

Several groups sprang up to press for redress of Tamil
grievances. In the center was the Tamil United Front
(TUF), formed in 1972 and calling autonomy. On the left
side of the political spectrum the Tamil Students
Federation (TSF) advocated more radical solutions, such
as independence. The most radical group came to be known
as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an armed
separatist group committed to insurgency.
In 1978 fighting erupted between the LTTE and the army,
causing the government to declare the group illegal on 19
May 1978. The government was also empowered to proscribe
any organization which advocated the use of violence and
which was directly or indirectly connected with any
unlawful activity.

But the military lacked a counterterror capability.
Indeed, its total ground strength was effectively
contained in five infantry battalions. The capability for
intelligence-gathering and surgical application of force,
in other words, was all but lacking at this time in Sri
Lanka. The advantage lay with the terrorists.

Violence escalated, and by the early 1980s terror
incidents by the Tamils unleashed spasms of communal
conflict -- one ambush in Jaffna, in which 13 soldiers
died, prompted widespread rioting and looting directed
against Tamils. At least 400 persons were killed and
100,000 left homeless; another 60,000 fled to India.
Police stood by, and in many cases members of the armed
forces participated in the reprisals.
The violence served to traumatize the Tamil community and
provided the Tigers with an influx of new manpower. Thus
the ascendancy of radical leadership in the struggle for
Tamil Eelam was complete. Both the militants and the
authorities recognized that, for the moment, the conflict
would take the form of a military test of strength. The
government reacted by improving coordination and
strategic direction through the formation in March 1984
of a Ministry of National Security, headed by Lalith
Athulathmudalai, in effect a command center for the
conduct of a counterinsurgency campaign. Expansion of
numbers and equipment for all of the security forces was
undertaken, as were steps to tighten discipline and to
halt abuses of the population.

The small size of the Sri Lankan security forces made
such steps imperative. Though Athulathmudalai clearly
intended to conduct a counterinsurgency in the British
mode, with military measures deriving direction from the
overall thrust of a political solution, the very size of
the emerging separatist armed threat made forceful
military measures inevitable. But without substantive
movement towards the framing of particulars in a
political option, there was a danger that military
suppression would become an end unto itself.

This is precisely what occurred. Even a police Special
Task Force (STF), formed in 1984 specifically for a
careful, nuanced approach to "counterinsurgency," quickly
became but another aggressive unit in a general
deployment to combat. Escalation of hostilities led to
conflict nationwide, eventual Indian intervention in July
1987, and the complete domination of the "liberation
struggle" by the LTTE, which proclaimed itself
Mrxist-Leninist.
Only with the election of a coalition headed by the Sri
Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in August 1994, followed by
the November presidential victory of SLFP leader
Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga -- these polls ending
17 years of United National Party (UNP) power -- was
politics allowed to drive the military response to the
problem. A three-month cease-fire, during which Colombo
sought to frame a solution acceptable to all parties,
ended when the LTTE launched attacks on government
forces. These included use of underwater assets to
destroy navy ships, as well as introduction of SA-7
surface-to-air missiles into the conflict. The latter
were used to down several air force transports, later at
least one helicopter. Armor was already in use by both
sides. What had begun as a campaign by terrorists had
grown to conventional civil war.
Security Force Options

In mid-1995, therefore, the government held a series of
meetings designed to settle upon a national strategy for
ending the conflict. Incredibly, no such step had
hitherto been taken. These meetings, of which there were
at least three primary sessions, did not go well. The
government itself, as the meetings progressed,
articulated a plan for devolution which came close, in
all but name, to abandoning the unitary state in favor of
a federal system. Yet while all official bodies basically
agreed that the Tigers would have to be defeated
militarily in order for the political solution to be
implemented, there was disagreement on the plan of
operations.

On one side were those who saw no option but to end the
LTTE hold on Jaffna by direct assault. The principal
advocate of this approach was Anuruddha Ratwatte, a
presidential relative and, effectively, Minister of
Defense (he was actually the Deputy Minister, but the
President herself was the Minister, so Ratwatte ran the
security forces). He was joined by a body of military
officers who felt the effort had to be made. Opposed was
an equally distinguished and senior body of officers,
both active and retired, who demurred. They cited the
considerable success which had been achieved by the
systematic domination of areas using force to shield
restoration of government control. This approach, they
argued, while much slower, would be ever less costly in
lives and financial resources.

The former category was obvious, since any assault on
Jaffna would involve the taking of hardened,
well-defended positions. The latter point was equally
important, though, because by 1995 interest payments to
service government debt were of themselves 29.9 percent
of current expenditures, with a figure of close to 48
percent reached if amortization and interest payments
were included under debt service. High intensity
operations, regardless of purely military considerations,
were bound to worsen this financial situation.

So bitter became the debate that at least one key
commander, Brigadier Janaka Perera of the Reserve Strike
Force (RSF), was summarily relieved in consequence of the
tone and substance of his objections. He opted to accept
a brigade command in the extreme northeast rather than
retire. In all of this, the army commander, Lieutenant
General Gerry de Silva -- like Perera, a Sandhurst
graduate -- found himself very much in the middle. His
important contribution after assuming command on 1
January 1994 had been to rationalize the command and
control structure of a force grown to 76 infantry
battalions alone (drawn from three sources -- active,
reserves, and national guard). With his own staff divided
on the merits of a Jaffna assault, he was torn between
demands from above that he lead the charge and from below
that he back another course of action.
Perera's arguments were illustrative of the proposed
alternatives. He advocated continuing systematic
domination of areas while taking the battle directly to
the insurgents using special operations. These were the
tactics he had used successfully in the south during the
resurgence of a Sinhalese communist group, Janatha
Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP, "People's Liberation Front"). A
previous effort by the JVP to seize power in 1971 had
been bloodily suppressed, but the group had gained new
life in the wake of India's July 1987 military
intervention in Sri Lanka as a "peacekeeping force."
Portraying itself as the representative of Sri Lankan
nationalism, the JVP convulsed the Sinhalese areas of the
country before being destroyed. Perera played a crucial
role in breaking the JVP by capturing a number of its key
personalities, to include its head, Rohana Wijeweera.

As his weapon, Perera made use of a special forces
brigade which grouped together units of the commandos and
special forces. These, like most of Sri Lanka's military
forces, had developed in step with the Tamil insurgency.

While the threat was still terrorism -- with attacks
including strikes against Colombo's commercial air links
-- a small commando force had been formed. It had but two
squadrons, one devoted to rapid response missions,
principally anti-hijacking, the other to VIP security. As
actual hostilities progressed, the commandos found
themselves active in counterguerrilla operations as well.

The shortage of such personnel led to the formation of a
separate Special Forces Regiment, primarily for jungle
operations. Leaving permutations aside, the end result
was that both the commandos and the special forces
eventually evolved into forces of two battalions each
(these with approximately 450 men rather than the
standard infantry 600 strength), brought together in a
special forces brigade.
During his four-year tenure as special forces brigade
commander, Perera expanded its operations into a variety
of unconventional areas, including airmobile assault and
undercover work. There was even one squadron which used
motorcycles during its operations.

When Gerry de Silva formed a reserve strike force in July
1994 as an integral part of his refining of the command
structure, Perera was picked to lead it. Under him were
not only the four battalions which had been in the
special forces brigade but also six infantry battalions,
mechanized and airmobile, and three armor battalions. As
such it was an elite strike force which could respond in
virtually any fashion to a threat anywhere in the theater
of operations. It was also the force Perera lost when his
blunt assessment of the planned Jaffna operation cost him
his job.

Exile, in any event, proved brief. When the actual
assault on Jaffna was launched in October of this year,
Perera was recalled to command the cutting edge of the
attack. Certainly his concerns, as well as those of
others who shared his opinion, had not changed, but all
were unwilling to sit on the sidelines as the security
forces locked horns in fierce battle with the LTTE.

The Future

Jaffna fell to government forces in early December,
bringing the conventional phase of combat to a close. But
the war is certainly not over. Problems remain --
problems that should have been addressed in the earliest
stages. From a lesson-learned perspective, the fighting
clearly illustrates how a terrorist threat of minor
proportions progressed to a multi-divisional assault upon
a heavily fortified built-up area, using all the arsenal
of conventional combat -- air power, artillery, and
armor, among others. The Tigers even have reportedly
employed homemade chemical weapons.

The ferocity that the struggle has gained over the years
cannot be understated. Many of the principal
personalities involved, to include both the presidents of
Sri Lanka and India, have fallen in the process.

Neither should the complexity of the task as it has
developed be underestimated. A Third World state has in a
dozen years been forced to create, support, and deploy a
force with nearly twice the infantry battalions available
to the likes to the United Kingdom. It has done so at
heavy human and financial cost. The rearming for the
present Jaffna offensive alone is estimated to have run
up a bill of some $500 million.
What is sobering, though, is that the security dynamic
has scarcely changed since battle was joined. The debate
within the Sri Lankan command concerning the attack on
Jaffna, for instance, was not on the necessity of taking
out that insurgent center but rather on the means and the
timing. Assessing its own political situation, as well as
that of its opponents, Colombo decided that it could not
adopt the long haul approach. It was well understood that
the attack would be costly and that insurgent elements
would certainly seek to relocate elsewhere in the country
to continue the fight.
Preparations were thus made to safeguard the gains made
in the east and "near north" (that area south of Jaffna),
those Tamil-populated areas which remain in contention,
as well as to secure the Sinhalese rear area itself.
These have been mostly successful, at least on the
surface, though Tiger attacks succeeded in destroying oil
stores in Colombo and in massacring a number of Sinhalese
villages.

Whether the cost of the Jaffna assault -- thousands of
casualties had already resulted at the time of this
writing -- proves commensurate with the results will
depend upon the government's follow-up. Among the many
ironies of the war is the fact that at no time has a
majority of Tamils lived in the so-called "Tamil
homelands." This has become even more the case as the
years have gone by.

The ceasefire and its subsequent violation by the Tigers
has served the useful purpose of exposing once again,
both domestically and internationally, the fact that
revolution as opposed to reform is the LTTE aim.
Consequently, not only has there been a decided shift in
international circles away from the sympathetic tilt of
many towards the Tigers, there has also been an upsurge
in numbers of Tamil civilians fleeing LTTE areas for
government lines.

In the key Vavuniya district, for instance, where
three-quarters of the area remains under LTTE control,
that precise proportion of the population lives on the
government side of the lines -- wherein there had been no
incidents during the year before the Jaffna attack. The
test will be whether the costly seizure of Jaffna serves
to facilitate further this domi- nation of the populace.

Certainly the struggle will continue. What is hoped in
Colombo is that the destruction of the insurgent head
will push the conflict back to the level at which it
should have remained had government response been more
appropriate and foreign intervention less disruptive
(India, now firmly on Colombo's side, was for much of the
conflict an ally of the insurgents; Tamil Nadu in
southern India continues to be used as a base and staging
area despite New Delhi's efforts).

Thus it can be dealt with using the techniques and forces
developed for special operations. Had these been
available from the start, combined with the greater
political and social sensitivity now evident in Colombo's
strategic approach, it is unlikely the story of the Tamil
insurgency would have grown to such gigantic proportions.

Louis: Chalice Press, 1995), 128 pp., $15.95.
The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City was a pivotal event in
America's experience with terrorism. Although this was
not the first time that a vehicle bomb had been used
against a civilian target in the United States, it was
the first of such incidents to kill and injure hundreds
of people. For this and other reasons, April 19, 1995
will forever be remembered as a day of infamy.
A number of books have come out since the bombing to both
explain what happened and to pay tribute to those who
lost their lives on that day. Oklahoma Rescue, the first
book published on the bombing, was written by Oklahoma
City Assistant Fire Chief Jon Hansen. Hansen imparts a
moving personal account of the rescue effort, from the
moment that he heard the bomb blast to the recovery of
the final three bodes of the victims on May 29.

Two of the new books were compiled to remember those who
lost their lives and to commemorate the valiant efforts
of the rescue workers and volunteers. Requiem for the
Heartland is a photographic compilation that vividly
shows the devastation of the bombing and Oklahoma City's
efforts to carry on in the face of adversity. In their
Name, another pictorial work, is a collection of
first-hand accounts from the survivors of the bombing and
from the next of kin, the rescue workers and the citizens
of Oklahoma City who were trying to cope in the
aftermath. Both books contain powerful photos, many of
which will be familiar to those who followed the bombing
closely. Proceeds from these books will be donated to
charities involved in assisting the Oklahoma City bombing
victims. Both books are fitting tributes to those who
died and to those who selflessly gave of themselves to
help.

The final book on the bombing is very different from the
others. And the Angels Wept is a compilation of sermons
delivered at various religious institutions in Oklahoma
City in the aftermath of the bombing. It is a touching
tribute to those religious leaders who attempted to make
some sense out of this terrible tragedy. All of the
proceeds of this work will go to the Interfaith Disaster
Recovery of Greater Oklahoma City.

Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook, by John
Dermaut (International Network of Protection Specialists,
Global Security Complex, 1995), 200 pp., $19.95,
805-845-7011. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

Sometimes, someone finds a new way to present
time-honored material in a different and more useful way.
That is the case with the new pocket-sized Protection
Specialist Survey and Checkbook, produced by the
International Network of Protection Specialists (INPS).
The INPS is a relatively new organization focusing on the
professional needs of those in the security fraternity
who are largely responsible for the personal protection
of others. John Dermaut, director of the INPS, has made a
significant contribution to the literature by packaging a
considerable amount of information into a compact format,
and by adding his own international perspective and
knowledge to the mix. The result is an extremely useful
guide and series of checklists that can be used
repeatedly when doing advance work and in providing
personal protection in any context.
The book is divided into two parts. The first deals with
buildings and transportation. It provides checklists and
reminders for dealing with residences, offices, hotels,
restaurants, hospitals, cars, planes, trains--and many
other aspects of personal protection in a wide range of
environments. The second part contains specific
information and checklists for doing advance work, route
surveys, and many other tasks. It also contains several
useful references for dealing with improvised explosive
devices and letter bombs, along with a conversion chart
for metric-English measurements, a listing of country and
area telephone codes, and some key dates for the
protection specialist to keep in mind (especially
important since many attacks are linked anniversaries of
events).
The Protection Specialist Survey and Checkbook is an
extremely useful publication, and its compact, pocket
size makes it a reference that can easily be taken along
on any site survey or advance trip. Its many checklists
should ease the task of providing personal protection,
and its comprehensive coverage should ensure that nothing
is overlooked. This inexpensive book belongs in the
library of all protection specialists, although it won't
stay there gathering dust. Its sturdy cover may
eventually become dog-eared through use, but protection
specialists will certainly welcome its help.

The Seven Steps to Personal Safety, by Richard B. Isaacs
and Tim Powers  (New York: Varro Press, 1993), 170 pp.,
913-432-6399. Reviewed by Mayer Nudell.

The past few years have seen a number of advisory books
intended to help people learn to protect themselves from
crime and other assorted evils of modern life. Most of
them concentrate either on avoiding dangerous situations
or on self-defense techniques to use when attacked. The
Seven Steps to Personal Safety is one of the few to
combine both aspects into a common-sense approach to
personal safety. The authors each have many years of
experience in law enforcement, criminal justice, and
self-defense training. Against this background they have
focused their presentation on awareness and avoidance,
while providing a continuum from awareness through
reaction and response to the aftermath of a violent
incident. In the jargon of the security manager, the
authors take a systems approach to personal defense and
safety, and the seven steps they propose flow from one to
the next.

The authors' seven steps to personal safety are: 1) being
aware of vulnerability, 2) mental commitment to doing
everything possible to remain safe, 3) being aware of the
environment and taking reasonable precautions, 4)
creating and maintaining distance to escape threatening
situations, 5) stopping an assault and escaping, 6)
immediate notification of the police, and 7) dealing with
post-incident stress. Each chapter focuses on one of
these steps, providing a wealth of useful information
that anyone can use.
Isaacs and Powers present a number of options that
individuals can choose from should they find themselves
exposed to danger. Recognizing that a major part of both
avoidance and response is mental, they repeatedly discuss
that aspect of personal safety--ranging from planning to
the decision about how to respond from an attack, and in
recovering from an attack's effects. They stress that
behavioral changes in attitudes toward life need not
result in paranoia, but in a feeling of being in control
and of feeling secure. The net result should be more
self-assurance and an increased ability to enjoy life.
The Seven Steps to Personal Safety also contains both
verbal and physical techniques that can be used in
various situations to either de-escalate tension or to
respond to an attack. These techniques are presented as
part of an overall programmatic approach to personal
safety. While not a replacement for a well-conceived
training program, this book provides an intelligent and
effective method of enhancing personal safety.

Book Review: Religion and the Racist Right, by Michael
Barkun (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press,
1994), 304 pp., $15.95, order line 800-848-6224. Reviewed
by Jack Plaxe.

This work by a political science professor at Syracuse
University provides a history of Christian Identity, a
movement that has provided the justification for and
fuels the hatred of many American far right racist and
anti-Semitic groups such as the Aryan Nations, the Order,
the Posse Comitatus, and elements of the Ku Klux Klan.
Christian Identity is a British theology of anti-Semitism
and racial holy war that has largely been adopted by
white supremacists in the United States. Barkun argues
that despite its small size and lack of public
prominence, Identity doctrine has become the single most
important religious position on the racist right.

Book Review: Comrade Criminal: Russia's New Mafia, by
Stephen Handelman (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University
Press, 1995), 383 pp., $27.50. Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.

Comrade Criminal is described as "the first comprehensive
investigation into the organized crime and corruption
that plague Russia today." The author, former Moscow
bureau chief of the Toronto Star, makes extensive use of
interviews to show how organized crime is hindering
Russia's transition to democracy. The breakup of the
Soviet Union has resulted in a virtual free-for-all for
bureaucrats and criminals. Smuggling and the black market
activity have become an integral part of the Russian
economy over the past 20 years. Along with this comes
criminal activity that manifests itself in gang-style
executions, kidnappings, and drugs and weapons
trafficking. Widespread corruption, bureaucratic red tape
and a high level of taxation make it difficult for
business to be conducted honestly. The current crime wave
is so vast and the Russian authorities so overwhelmed and
under funded that they are doomed to failure.

Book Review: Priority Mail, by Mark Winne (New York: Lisa
Drew, 1995), 317 pp., $23.00. Reviewed by Jack Plaxe.

This is the story of law enforcement efforts to identify
serial bomber Walter Leroy Moody, whose bombing campaign
targeted lawyers, officials of the NAACP, and judges on
the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Moody was
first convicted in 1972 of a mail bombing that targeted a
used car dealer who repossessed his car. After serving
time in prison, Moody was freed and filed an appeal. The
court's denial of a rehearing fueled Moody's terror
campaign, which began in December 1989 when Judge Robert
Vance was killed by a letter bomb sent to his home in
Birmingham, Alabama. The same tactic was used two days
later against a lawyer for the NAACP in Savannah,
Georgia. Fortunately for investigators, Moody's bombs
were so similar to the 1972 device that prosecutors were
able to obtain a conviction in spite of a lack of
fingerprints, witnesses or a paper trail linking him to
the 1989 bombings.

Perfection in the Palm of Your Hand

Glock introduces the Model 26 and Model 27--compact
pistols which combine Glock technology with firepower,
simplicity, interchangeability, and precision, all in a
package so compact and concealable that it fits in the
palm of your hand. The G26 is designed in 9mm, and the
G27 in .40 caliber. Those concerned about defending
themselves can walk down a dark street with confidence
knowing they have the power of a service caliber Glock
pistol on their side.

The concealability of these compact pistols are the main
selling point as a self-defense weapon, or as a backup
weapon. With a 6-inch slide and a height of only 4
inches, these pistols easily slip into an ankle holster
or handbag.

Another distinctive advantage is that the G26 accepts
magazines from the 9mm Glock models 17 and 19; the .40
caliber G27 accepts magazines from the models 22 and 23.
Both models have plenty of firepower, since the G26 holds
10 rounds and the G27 holds nine rounds. Law enforcement
officers who carry Glock pistols of the same caliber like
the concept that their duty magazines are compatible with
their backup or off-duty pistol.
Simple upkeep and training make these mini-pistols the
perfect choice for anyone desiring a compact for personal
safety. The same technology that made Glock known for
accuracy and ease of shooting still applies to these
compact packages. The recoil is lessened by the low
positioning of the slide and the unique double-recoil
spring, allowing each pistol to perform exactly like its
larger counterparts.

Anyone who can shoot a Glock can pick up the compact
version and expect the same function, accuracy, and
performance. Since the inner mechanisms are identical in
function and design with the other Glock pistols, field
stripping, cleaning, and servicing are as simple on the
G26 and G27 as on any other Glock.

summer ITT Night Vision began a new Law Enforcement lease
program. The company is offering three standard lease
packages, but each can be modified to accommodate the
equipment chosen to lease. The minimum retail value of
equipment that can be leased is $10,000, with terms of 36

high-tech security and surveillance equipment since 1959.
CCS has outfitted a remote control high-voltage
briefcase--generating 100,000 volts--with a motion
detector and an audio alarm. If the briefcase is snatched
from the floor of an airport, on the train while you're
snoozing, or even in a hotel room while you're showering,
zap goes the power into the entire perimeter of the case,
not just the handle. At the same time, an ear-piercing
alarm will shriek to make sure you've been alerted. If
someone grabs the briefcase from your hand, simply press
the remote control (less than half the size of a
cigarette pack) to instantaneously activate both alarm
and voltage. This briefcase will protect your jewelry,
valuables, cash, and private papers--everything you need
while on the go.

Desktop Surveillance

Dedicated Micros, a leading provider of advanced
surveillance equipment and the developer of the first
CCTV video multiplexer, announced a new product line of
compact, full-featured digital video multiplexers that
make "desktop surveillance" a practical option for the
first time.
Dedicated Micros' new Sprite product line of six digital
video multiplexers are housed in identical cases. Each
Sprite has a footprint just over one square foot and 3
1/3 inches tall, and includes a built-in keyboard pitched
at a comfortable angle. The innovative design enables all
Sprites to sit unobtrusively on a desk.

Designed to meet a wide variety of user requirements, the
new Sprites are available in capacities ranging from four
to 16 cameras, color or monochrome operation, with
simplex and duplex models. The new multiplexers are the
Sprite SX 4C (four camera, simplex color with quad
capability), Sprite SX 9 (nine camera, simplex, mono),
Sprite DX 9 (nine camera, duplex, mono), and Sprite SX 9C
(nine camera, simplex, color), Sprite DX 16 (16 camera,
duplex, mono).

The multiplexers' attractive styling, compact size, ease
of installation and operation, many features, and low
cost-per-feature pricing are designed to open up the
emerging residential market and expand markets for small-
and medium-sized businesses, as well as large
organizations with CCTV requirements of up to 16 cameras.

Among the many features are true duplex operation,
activity detection with sensitivity settings, alarms
tagged to videotape for quick review, and flexible
multi-screen displays. Also, time and date is recorded
indelibly to the tape during recording--not during
playback--to assure evidentiary integrity.
The use of just four selection keys and color-coded menu
screens appearing on the monitor greatly simplifies
installation and operation of the entire Sprite product
line. The menus provide easy access to all options and
features. Preprogrammed function keys provide one-touch
movement between recording modes. There is also a
one-touch system status button. A scheduling function
permits automatic time-of-day recording mode changes.

Security Planters

California-based Dura Art Stone offers a complete line of
precast planters designed for security applications. With
today's heightened interest in preventing terrorist
attacks on all types of public buildings, these
components may be used to create economical,
attractive-looking yet highly effective buffer zones
between buildings and potential bombers.
Dura Art Stone offers more than 30 different designs,
each available in a wide selection of sizes, shapes,
colors, and finishes--providing hundreds of options from
which to choose. Any of the designs may be used in
conjunction with subterranean reinforcement to create a
barricade around a building, or to line a winding
driveway so as to slow down vehicles approaching a
guardhouse. When filled with plants or trees, these
planters provide a decorative look that is far more
aesthetic--and economical--than alternative barricades
such as steel fencing or troughs.

US Border Patrol Receives New Night Vision Gear

This fall, the US Border Patrol will begin using the
Long-Range Infrared Surveillance System (LORIS), made by
Inframetrics, Inc., to help detect the illegal entry of
aliens and contraband into the United States. At full
value, the contract is worth $17 million with options to
purchase up to 500 LORIS systems and accessories over a
five-year period.

Since most illegal border crossings occur at night and in
remote or relatively lightly traveled areas, the ability
to "see in the dark" is critical to the Border Patrol.
Unlike night vision goggles and other less sophisticated
IR scopes, infrared cameras like the LORIS system are
sensitive to body heat and can operate in total darkness
and under poor weather conditions.
The LORIS is a field-proven, all-weather unit designed
specifically for long-range surveillance with a detection
range of up to and beyond five miles. Used day or night,
the system produces high-quality thermal images for
display on standard video monitors. Weighing just 35
pounds, the sensor head is transportable and can be
mounted on a number of platforms including mobile
surveillance vehicles, communication towers, and other
fixed installations. In addition to border patrol
surveillance, LORIS systems are in use today in military,
drug interdiction, weapons testing and tracking, maritime
surveillance, and industrial security applications.

Britain Condemned in IRA Killings

September 27: The European Court of Human Rights
condemned Britain for the 1988 slayings in Gibraltar of
three IRA members who were believed to be planning a car
bomb attack there. British officials argued that the SAS
commandos responsible for the killings acted properly
because they believed that the terrorists were armed and
about to detonate their explosives. As it later turned
out, the three were unarmed and were going through a dry
run of their planned bombing. The Strasbourg-based court
ruled in a 10 to 9 vote that the commandos' actions were
based on flawed intelligence and that British authorities
had shown a "lack of appropriate care in the control and
organization of the arrest operation." The British
government called the ruling "irresponsible."

Unabomber Probe Focuses on High Schools

October 4: The FBI is investigating three high schools in
Niles Township, near Chicago, that in the 1970s offered a
number of science courses as well as a fledgling computer
club that, according to the Washington Post, "represented
an intriguing and somewhat antithetical element in the
changing educational climate of the times." FBI officials
interviewed teachers at the schools and allegedly
subpoenaed the transcripts of a handful of former
students.

Hamas Pledges to End Attacks Against Israel

October 6: According to Palestinian officials in the Gaza
Strip, the militant group Hamas tentatively agreed to
cease its terrorist attacks against Israel. The pledge is
part of a draft agreement between Hamas leaders in the
West Bank and Gaza and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. However,
experts note that Hamas leaders based in Jordan and Syria
hold a harder line against Israel than do their
counterparts in the West Bank and Gaza. Whether or not
they would back the no terrorism pledge remains to be
seen.

Amtrak Train Derailed

October 9: FBI officials suspect terrorism in the case of
a derailed Amtrak train in the western Arizona desert.
Two locomotives and four cars of the 12-car Sunset
Limited traveling between New Orleans and Los Angeles
were derailed when the train hit a section of torn track.
The saboteurs knew enough to disable a warning system
that alerts oncoming trains if any sections of track have
been disturbed. One crew member was killed and 78
passengers were injured. Officials said that two notes
were found near the scene of the crash train claiming
credit in the name of the "Sons of Gestapo," apparently
in revenge for the US government's handling of the Waco
and Ruby Ridge sieges.

Philippines calls for Joint Campaign Against Terrorism

October 24: During an interview at the United Nations'

President Fidel Ramos proposed a counterterrorism
conference in Manila in February 1996. He asked that
experts from the United States, Asia, the Middle East,

immediately. Ramos said that his aim was "to establish a
closer and more effective network to exchange information
and take action on terrorist threats all over the world."
Ramos said the discovery of the plot to kill the pope in
Manila last January made such a conference imperative.

Paris, while dozens of students were outside on a break.
Six students were treated for shock and earaches. The
homemade bomb was made from an iron tube packed with
explosives, police said. The force of the blast blew out
several window panes. School was let out early and
students were sent home. Earlier this month, authorities
discovered an empty gas canister on the steps of the town
hall in Les Mureaux. Gas canisters packed with nuts,
bolts, and nails have been used in the other bombings and

Bomb Suspect Seized in France

November 2: After finding a bomb in the northern city of
Lille, French police arrested 15 suspects including
Boualen Bensaid, an Algerian suspected of being the
"pivotal figure" in the wave of attacks in France since
midsummer. Bensaid moved to France several months ago,
bolstering suspicions that the terrorist groups consist
of Islamic sympathizers recruited in the troubled French
suburbs where many unemployed immigrants live. According
to the Paris newspaper, Le Monde, both the attack and the
arrested suspects were similar to previous bombings:
canisters filled with explosives and shrapnel planted by
young Algerians with police records for minor offenses.

retaliation for the assassination of Islamic Jihad leader
Fathi Shaqaqi. The first bomb exploded near an
army-escorted bus carrying babysitters from Israel to the

November 4: Iran marked the sixteenth anniversary of the
storming of the US embassy in Tehran with a large march
and the burning of American flags, while Tehran radio
stations broadcast school children chanting "Death to
America." Iran's state-run media reported that tens of
thousands of men and women, mostly university students,
marched through the streets with banners proclaiming
their "hatred toward the world-devouring United States
and Israel." This year's anniversary celebrations were
more vocal than in the past, probably because they follow
on the heels of tightened US sanctions against Iran
beginning last June.

Libya's Role in International Terrorism by Jack Plaxe

Since the early 1970's, the Libyan government under Muammar
Qaddafi has both used and sponsored terrorism against the
enemies of the Libyan state.  The "enemies" that have been
attacked include the United States, Israel, neighboring
African states and outspoken Libyan dissidents who oppose the
Qaddafi regime.

Over the years, Qaddafi has provided support to such diverse
groups as the Palestine Liberation Front, the Provisional
Irish Republican Army and the Black Power movement in the
United States.  In the 1980's, Qaddafi's sponsorship and use
of terrorism greatly expanded.  Libya began to provide
operational support in the form of travel documents, weapons,
training, and safe haven to the Abu Nidal organization.
Libyan government agents also began to carry out terrorist
operations directly.  Some of the more notorious terrorist
incidents that Libya has been involved in include:

     The April 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco (3 killed,
  dozens injured)
     The December 1987 bombing of the USO lounge in Barcelona (1
  killed, 9 injured)
     The July 1988 machine gun and hand grenade assault on the
  Greek cruise ship 'The City of Poros' (9 killed, over 100
  injured)
     The December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 (270 killed)
     The September 1989 bombing of UTA flight 772 (171 killed)

  Despite these terrorist activities, many countries continue to
do business with and maintain diplomatic relations with Libya.
These links provide the Qaddafi government in Libya with
legitimacy which allows it to participate in international
organizations such as the United Nations, the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and INTERPOL.

The United States strategy vis a vis Libya has been to attempt
to isolate Libya through the imposition of unilateral economic
sanctions.  This strategy was revised in 1992 when the U.S.
led efforts at the United Nations to impose limited aviation
and diplomatic sanctions on Libya for its role in the Pan Am
103 bombing.  These sanctions have since been expanded to
include a variety of limited economic sanctions.  However, the
sanctions do not include an embargo on Libyan oil, the primary
source of Libyan hard currency revenues.

The result of these limited sanctions is that Libya has been
somewhat isolated yet they still participate in international
fora such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  If Libya is to be
truly isolated, all nations who condemn terrorism must work to
restrict Libyan participation in the these organizations.

There are some indications that this is underway.  The United
States, Great Britain and France recently led a successful
effort to deny Libya a seat on the UN Security Council.  In
addition, the Libyan delegation to the INTERPOL annual
terrorism conference was rebuked when the US delegation
presented information to the effect that they were seeking two
Libyan government agents for their role in the Pan Am 103
bombing.  The Libyan delegation was so humiliated by the US
presentation that they left the conference and did not return.

Despite these steps, additional efforts must be undertaken to
isolate Libya economically.  It is highly doubtful that
European and other countries will voluntarily stop doing
business with Qaddafi.  For this reason, the limited aviation,
diplomatic, and economic sanctions currently imposed on Libya
through the UN Security Council must be expanded to either
include a complete ban on Libyan oil sales (as was done
against Iraq after the Gulf War) or a total naval blockade of
Libya.  Either action will deny Libya the petrodollars that
prop up the Qaddafi government.

Efforts should also be taken to isolate Libya diplomatically
by denying them the right to participate in international fora
such as the UN, ICAO, and INTERPOL.  A nation that has been
shown to both use and sponsor terrorism should not be a member
of an international police organization whose focus is
international cooperation to prevent criminal activity.  Nor
should Libya be allowed to participate in ICAO, particularly
in light of its involvement in the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772
bombings which resulted in over 400 deaths.

Terrorism has long been an important instrument of Libyan
foreign policy.  The international community must take
stronger steps to isolate Qaddafi both diplomatically and
economically.  If countries continue to provide the Libyan
government legitimacy through trade opportunities and
participation in international fora, the Qaddafi regime will
remain in power and continue to support terrorist activities
around the world.

TERRORISM IN AMERICA: AN ASSESSMENT BY VARIOUS EXPERTS by
Lloyd F. Reese, CPP, CISSP

Two major incidents, the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma
City Federal Building, have shown that terrorist acts have
come to our shores.  They can originate from outside our
boundaries or be truly home grown.  These incidents should not
have been any surprise, especially the homegrown one in
Oklahoma City.

On June 14,1995, the Washington, D.C. Chapter of  the American
Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) held its annual
Countering Terrorism Seminar.  Frank McGuire, a Bethesda, MD
security consultant, described an event in 1988 that should
have been a pointer to the damage even one man can do.  A
disgruntled tax payer rigged a homemade mortar in his pickup
truck that was designed to attack the building in West LA that
housed the IRS.  Fortunately, the chemicals involved had an
unintended reaction and the fire department was called for a
truck on fire. After extinguishing the fire, the fire fighters
noted a suspicious glow and called the bomb squad.  Several
city blocks were evacuated while the situation was resolved.
Had it gone off as planned, the IRS Building would have
suffered major damage with significant human losses.

McGuire was asked how to assess the potential risk created by
right-wing extremists.  He responded that, based on the West
LA scenario, and what we know about Oklahoma City, it is
conceivable for one deranged person to build a truck bomb.  It
would simply take longer than if he had help.  Using this
criteria, McGuire commented that if there are 1,000 people
nation-wide with these intentions and capabilities, that means
there could be 1,000 truck bombs.

Much media attention has been focused on militias and related
movements since the Oklahoma City bombing. At the ASIS Annual
Seminar in New Orleans, September 11-14, 1995, Daniel Donohue,
a security consultant based in Hallandale, Florida, discussed
"Domestic Terrorism and Right-Wing Extremist".  He began his
presentation by discussing the history of political violence
in America.  Most of us have forgotten our high school or
college U.S. history which covered labor organizing violence
in the late 19th  and early 20th centuries.  Violence by the
KKK against blacks, primarily in the South, resulted in many
lynchings in the 20s and 30s.  There was more racially related
violence in the 1960s and 70s during the civil rights
movement. The Vietnam War protesters sometimes became violent,
as at the Democratic Convention in Chicago.  This country has
not been immune from political violence, but most of us have
short memories.

Donohue believes that since the Oklahoma City bombing some
militia groups have disbanded and others have gone
underground.  He bases this observation on information
received from the Southern Poverty Law Center's Klanwatch
group, where he has done pro-bono work.

The Symposium, "Terrorism: Past, Present, and Future" was
sponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago, Office of
International Criminal Justice, July 31-August 3, 1995.  Peter
Probst, a Defense Department international crime specialist
stated, "Ten years ago, most terrorist groups were politically
motivated...now you have a whole range of new groups."  He
suggested that cults, ethnic, and religious groups will not
hesitate to cause large numbers of civilian casualties while
political terrorists have avoided this to keep from losing
political support.

Steven Sloan's paper,  "Terrorism: How Vulnerable is the
United States?", was published by the Strategic Studies
Institute of the Army War College in May 1995.  Sloan points
out that threats from fundamentalists of all religious groups
cannot be ignored. He suggests that such groups might receive
support or be joined by domestic religious extremists.  These
groups might also obtain support from cultists, survivalists,
or neo-fascists who have their own reasons for rejecting the
existing social, economic, and political order, waiting
instead for their own Armageddons.

A unique aspect of Sloan's paper is his suggestion that the
role that could be played by  apolitical terrorists, who are
into violence and intimidation as an aspect of their criminal
activities.  Drug gangs and other criminal enterprises in
inner-city America could become the basis for such operations.
They could corrupt local government with their vast funds.
These groups could use their terrorist tactics to "shake down
the neighborhood" or blackmail the entire city.  Their
financial resources would enable them to acquire a significant
arsenal of weapons to challenge local law enforcement and
implement acts of violence on a level on previously seen in
the U.S.

Most of us think about terrorist attacks on buildings, planes,
and people.  However, Frederick Cohen in his recent book,
Protection and Security on Information Superhighway, discusses
the concept of  "infrastructure warriors" who would attack
electrical power grids or eliminate telecommunications
capabilities.  He cites an article in the July/August 1993
issue of Wired magazine which named the top 10 U.S.
infrastructure targets.  These include the Culpeper, VA
telephone switch that handles federal fund transfers and the
Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS).
Another example he gives is a paper presented to the Naval
Postgraduate School in August of 1993 which claims that 20
people and $1,000,000 can bring the U.S. to its knees.

We did not learn much from the West L.A. situation described
by Frank McGuire.  Those in the contingency planning field
know that the effect of the World Trade Center bombing lasted
only a few months. However, research published in Information
Week showed that nearly 40 percent of the businesses in the
World Trade Center when the bomb exploded are no longer in
business.

As we can see from the examples cited above, there are many
possibilities for how terrorism can be viewed in the near
future within the U. S.  We can review past incidents both
here an overseas to understand tactics used against specific
types of targets.  We can improve our intelligence gathering
to obtain a better understanding of potential threats.  We can
practice "target hardening" to encourage the adversary move
away from us to a weaker target.  Finally, we must be have our
crisis management, contingency, and business resumption plans
developed and tested - just in case.  Regardless of what the
future holds, these steps are reasonable and prudent.

CANADA
POLITICS

As the dust began to settle over the province of Quebec's
late-October referendum decision to remain within Canada, the leader
of the seperatist Bloc Quebecois (BQ), Lucien Bouchard, announced his
decision to quit federal politics in favor of taking over the
premiership of the province from Jaques Parizeau.

It was Parizeau who led the BQ's provincial sister party, the Party
Quibicois (PQ), to victory in the provincial elections in 1994.
Parizeau resigned following the narrow defeat sustained by the PQ in
the referendum on independence.

In announcing his decision, Bouchard that while he would await
constitutional offers from the federal government aimed at keeping
Quebec within the federation, he expects that any such proposals will
prove inadequate.  As a result of that, Bouchard said that he will be
likely to call another referendum, but that it would not take place
before April 1997.  He went on to predict that the next referendum
would result in success for Quebec's seperatist movement.  While the
accuracy of that prediction remains to be seen, it is true to say
that Bouchard's dynamic entry into the debate over separatism in the
run-up to the last referendum was largely responsible for the near
victory achieved by the PQ then.  With Bouchard at the helm
throughout, the possibility of a sovereign Quebec before the turn of
the millennium cannot be ruled out.

Meanwhile, Bouchard's major opponent during the Quebec affair,
Federal Prime Minister Jean Chritien, has come in for severe
criticism from within the country's ruling Liberal Party for his
handling of the issue.  Prior to the referendum, Chritien had assured
anglophone Canadians that there was nothing to worry about in Quibic
and that the province would not be leaving the federation as a result
of the referendum because the separatists had no chance of winning
it.  As it turns out, the separatists came within a whisker.  The
last week of campaigning saw Chritiin back-pedaling furiously to
offer several concessions to the seperatists in order to prevent a
government defeat.

Now that the federalists' panic has receded, the whispering campaign
has begun.  Reports suggest that some within Chritien's party feel
that he is no longer the best man to ensure that Quibec remains
within the federation.  With Bouchard in place as the province's
premier as of the beginning of 1996, this feeling may well increase
to proportions at which Chritien's 31 year-old career in politics
could be threatened.

CANADA
ECONOMY

The latest OECD report on Canada suggests that, while the economy is
likely to see some degree of recovery during 1996, high levels of
provincial and federal debt will continue to present considerable
problems to the country's ability to weather any further economic
downturn, and may result in greater volatility of the Canadian
dollar.

Real GDP growth is estimated to rise by 3.1% in 1996, with the bulk
of growth coming from a 4.5% expansion in the second half of the
year.  The organization sees this growth coming as a result of a
broadening of the base of economic activity from the largely
export-led recovery that has been seen to date.  Despite an expected
increase in the levels of private consumption and housing as a result
of wage increases  in the export sector, widespread wage increases
are not expected, keeping down the magnitude of such private
consumption rises.  Public sector consumption spending is expected,
and hoped, to remain weak as commitment to fiscal austerity
continues.  Inflation is forecast to be around the middle of the Bank
of Canada's target range of 1-3%.

Canada's ratio of public sector debt to GDP now stands at some 65%,
with interest payments exceeding government deficits.

CHILE
POLITICS

Former dictator, Augusto Pinochet celebrated his 80th birthday at the
end of November and signaled his determination to remain at the
center of Chilean politics until his constitutional term as commander
of the army expires in 1998.  Pinochet's remarks will not have been
lost on President Eduardo Frei, who has attempted to challenge the
"constitutional safeguards" put in place by Pinochet when he handed
over government to civilian rule after the 1989 election of Patricio
Aylwin Azocar.

Under the arrangements that Pinochet made, both he, and nine military
appointed Senators remain in place until 1998.  Frei wants
desperately to get rid of them because his ruling coalition is three
seats short of a majority in the upper House.  Doubtless Frei would
also like to see an end to the need to spend some 39% of the public
sector wage bill, equivalent to 2.8% of GDP on the armed forces.
Another of Pinochet's parting gifts was to ensure that legislation
was passed that meant that no one could interfere with the military's
budget.

In addition to his comments about staying on to what may well be a
bitter end in terms of his relationship with Frei, Pinochet has been
explaining that his 17 years in power were a "soft" dictatorship.  He
went on to defend officers of his regime who are now in prison for
human rights' abuses and suggested that they had been imprisoned
despite any proof of wrong-doing.  One cannot help but wonder how
such comments were received by the families of those hundreds of
people who disappeared under the former dictator's regime and will
never see an eightieth birthday.

They will at least have been cheered to hear that former torture
chief, Manuel Contreras, who was convicted of murder in June, has
recovered from the hernia that had made him so poorly that he had to
be detained in a Naval hospital.  In a move that Frei himself will
doubtless applaud, Contreras' recovery has resulted in him finally
being able to be transferred to prison to serve his sentence.  In a
last ditch attempt at avoiding such a fate and a final display of his
boundless bravery, Contreras, who is believed to have been
responsible for the torture and murder of many of those who
disappeared, staged a hunger strike in October.  It lasted two days.

ECONOMY

After an initial delay in September, Codelco, the state-owned copper
corporation has announced that it is to go ahead with its plans for
the development of a fifth mine.  Radomiro Tomic will add will come
on stream in 1999 and add an initial 150,000 tonnes of copper a year
to the country's output.  Expansion to 225,000 tonnes is expected to
be swift, bringing Codelco's total output to 1.4 million tonnes by
the end of the decade.

The investment needed to develop the mine is estimated at some US$641
million and will be financed out of company cash flow, according to
Codelco's executive vice-president, Juan Villarzu.  The new venture
makes it highly unlikely that Codelco will go the way of other
parastatals in being privatized for the foreseeable future, and will
prove something of an acid test for the company in its attempts to
show that it can be as efficient and profitable as a privately owned
company.

NAFTA
With the US budget battle making it increasingly unlikely that
Chile's application for fast track entry into the North American Free
Trade Agreement will pass through the US legislature before it breaks
in mid-December, Canada and Mexico have indicated a willingness to
extend trade agreements of an equivalent nature to Chile in the
meantime.

The possibility of such a "bridging" arrangement should, according to
Canadian Trade Minister, Roy McLaren, be discussed by the three
countries in the near future.  Should such discussions prove
fruitful, Chile could see the arrangements come into force by
mid-1996.

COSTA RICA
POLITICS

The high levels of consensus that have traditionally marked Cost
Rican politics are beginning to wane as popularity for the government
of President Figueres and his National Liberation Party (PLN) has
fallen sharply.

Figueres and the PLN are approaching the mid point of their term in
office, which began in early 1994 when, in another almost
traditionally Costa Rican result, the incumbent Social Christian
Unity Party (PUSC) led by Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier were removed
from office.  Figueres and the PLN ran on a platform of blaming the
PUSC for implementing free market economic reforms that resulted in
higher unemployment and a host of other social problems.

Despite Figueres' stated opposition to free market policies and
IMF-sponsored structural adjustment programs, the recent decline in
what has been one of the region's richest economies has led him to
accept the need for reform.  This has been further underlined by the
country's high level of debt.  At an estimated US$4 billion, foreign
debt is equivalent to nearly 60% GDP and generates  a debt service
ratio of some 17%.  Internally, the PLN inherited a fiscal deficit of
8% from its predecessors.  Attempts to blame the outgoing Calderon
administration for the poor state of the country's finances, while
reasonably correct, have done little to calm the ire of the Costa
Rican people as the austerity measures put in place by the PLN have
bitten hard.

The hardships being faced by the population resulted in a wave of
strikes throughout 1995.  Public sector unions exercise considerable
strength within the political system of Costa Rica and such public
shows of dissent have, in the past, often resulted in changes in
government policy irrespective of which party has been in power.

It would seem that this is no longer the case, however.  Some 50,000
Costa Rican teachers held a month long strike toward the end of 1995,
denouncing both the government and the opposition for the handling of
economic policy and in particular the public sector layoffs that have
occurred and the increases in basic utility charges that have been
introduced.

Traditionally supporters of the NLP, the teachers have accused the
government of failing to meet its campaign pledges and has said that
the PLN now lacks credibility.  Unfortunately for the teachers, the
chances of a government turnaround appear slim.  The economic reforms
being put in place by the PLN are an integral part of the IMF standby
agreement sought by the government as part of the process of putting
the country's economic house in order.  The situation is likely to
get worse before it gets better.

CUBA
POLITICS

Determined to circumvent the efforts of some sections of the US
legislature to destroy the economy of his comparatively tiny country,
President Castro has been busy courting a wide variety of partners
for trade and cooperation during the last couple of months of 1995.
Increasingly it seems to be the USA rather than Cuba that is being
viewed as intransigent and unreasonable.

Perhaps in final recognition that a large section of the
international community looks none too kindly on the US stance on
Cuba, the American Senate passed a considerably watered-down version
of the Helms bill aimed at tightening the US embargo at the end of
October.  It was not watery enough, however, to prevent the passage
of a UN General Assembly resolution at the beginning of November
calling for an end to the US economic embargo.

Despite the resolution, some members of the US lower House are still
hoping to reintroduce some of the stiffer measures ditched by the
Senate when the two bills come up for reconciliation.  But with
Castro enjoying cordial relations in so many other places at present,
the effects of any such moves might well have been neutralized before
they can take place.

Meetings between Castro and the representatives of several other
countries including South Africa, Uruguay, Vietnam and Mongolia have
taken place recently.  All reported to have gone well and resulted
either in the signing of cooperation and/or trade agreements or have
gone some way toward such agreements.

In addition, Cuba and Russia have concluded a series of protocols
which the two countries describe as amounting to a new stage in trade
and financial relations between them.  Russia has agreed to a sugar
for oil deal which will ensure that what Castro has described as the
"Achilles' heel" of the Cuban economy will be protected to the tune
of 4.5 million tonnes of oil in return for 1.5 tonnes of sugar.  With
world sugar production expected to top the 120 million tonne mark for
the first time in 1995/96, Castro will be particularly satisfied to
have arranged a deal that takes Cuban sugar out of a potentially
falling market.

It should, however, be noted that neither country has yet completed
delivery of 1995's barter deal, which involved one million tons of
sugar for three million tons of oil.  Should things not work out,
however, a further source of oil is likely to be Angola, with whom
Cuba signed a cooperation accord at the end of October

In addition to the sugar deal, Russia has promised to give Cuba
enough money and technology to finish building a Soviet-era nuclear
reactor in the country.  Reportedly, Russia is to provide US$349
million and Cuba US$208 million towards the project.  A further
US$200 million is to be raised from an international consortium
including Latin American and Western countries.  Of the Latin
American contingent, Brazil will almost certainly be a part.  Recent
discussions between the two countries are believed to be likely to
result in the signing of a nuclear cooperation pact in the near
future.

Other recent negotiations have resulted in an investment agreement
being signed with Vietnam, the establishment of diplomatic relations
with Kenya and a deal in which Colombia has agreed to purchase
vaccines from Cuba.
Still more negotiations took place in November between Cuba and the
European Union (EU).  According to the EU these have a good chance of
leading to the signing of an economic and trade agreement, provided
that Castro is willing to accept some form of transition to
democracy.  So far, however, the Havana regime appears
unenthusiastic.  Alongside increased confidence of an economic
recovery in 1996, Castro's preparedness to spurn the double-handed
approach of the EU is perhaps as a result of a warming of relations
between Havana and Beijing.

The Cuban President made a reportedly highly successful trip to
China, again in November.  The visit coincided, strangely enough,
with a six day visit by general secretary of the Communist Party of
Vietnam.  Neither Cuba nor Vietnam have had particularly cordial
relations with China in the past, but the shrinking world of
communism seems to be uniting former adversaries in a struggle for
survival.

In his state of the nation speech in July last year, Castro said that
while he was prepared to go some way toward capitalism in order to
reform his country, he had no intention of giving up his ideology.
His visit to China has been seen as an exercise in learning how the
two may be combined.  While the discussions that took place in
Beijing remain largely unknown, the Chinese foreign ministry did say
that at wide range of bilateral issues were be dealt with and that
particular emphasis will be given to economic development.  The
possibility of a trilateral agreement between Cuba , China and
Vietnam was, however, ruled out.

CUBA
FINANCE

Much of Castro's confidence in dealing with the international
community stems from the fact that, despite all the odds being
stacked against it, the Cuban economy continues to grow.  Latest
figures released by the Planning Ministry suggest that GDP growth in
1995 will reach 2.5%, a significant advance on the 0.7% growth
recorded in 1994.

In a move aimed at re-starting talks with western creditors, the
government has released an astoundingly detailed report on the
country and its debt.  The report puts total debt at US$9.1 billion
at the end of 1994 and for the first time publishes balance of
payments' figures using IMF-recommended methods.  The data, which had
been specifically requested by creditors, shows an improvement in the
current account deficit from US$371.6 million in 1993 to US$81.3
million in 1994.  The decline in deficit is attributed to an increase
in exports and a rise in net current transfers, mostly from donations
and remittances from Cubans living abroad.

Cuba's parlous financial state means that it badly needs to gain
access to the medium and long term debt arrangements that have been
denied it since debt talks with the Paris Club of international
creditors stalled in 1986.  The release of this latest economic
report is the first step along that road, but there is still some
considerable distance to go.  The journey will be made that much more
difficult by the fact that Cuba is not a member of the IMF and the
chances of the USA allowing it to rejoin are slim.

In the meantime, not to be outdone, Castro has told the people of
Cuba that the "capitalist evil" of income tax will be falling upon
them again as of January 1996.  For the time being the tax will be
payable on hard currency earnings only, but the writing is on the
wall for taxation of the relatively low national state salaries.

In a further move aimed at easing the country's financial problems,
two more foreign banks, France's Societe Generale and Banco Sabadell
of Spain, have been authorized to open branches in Cuba.  These two
bring to 11 the number of foreign banks that have been granted
licenses to operate in Cuba over the last few months.

Credit and loan agreements have been signed with several of the
foreign banks now represented in the country and, although figures
have not been released, it is believed that the deals involve
financing for Cuba's sugar, nickel and rice production and for food
imports.

EL SALVADOR
POLITICS

Despite recent attempts by President Calderon, to assure the people
of El Salvador that all is well and a life of prosperity and laughter
awaits them, tanks took to the streets in November amid large scale
demonstrations and rumors of a military coup attempt.

Members of the National Civilian Police used rubber bullets and tear
gas to bring to an end a siege when former soldiers of the Farabundo
Marti Liberation Front (FLMN) occupied a building in the capital, San
Salvador.  The protesting soldiers held the inhabitants hostage for
three hours, demanding that the government fulfill the promises it
made under the Chapultepec peace agreement concerning job training
and the granting of loans.  This was the latest in a series of
demonstrations carried out by demobilized fighters demanding help
with their reintegration into society.

The incident, in which one of the former soldiers was killed, gave
rise to persistent rumors of an imminent coup attempt as armored
vehicles, troops and helicopters reportedly took up positions around
the city.  However, the threat of a coup was dismissed by Calderon,
who said that the rumors were of a plot to destabilize the country,
hatched by the FMLN and the working classes.  According to the
government, evidence of the plot had been uncovered and the heads of
metropolitan riot police and mobile units were given details in a
special memorandum.

The memorandum, which apparently details several planned activities
by labor organizations aimed at "paralyzing the country and provoking
insurrection", was condemned by FMLN leader, Leonel Gonzalez, as
untrue.  According to Gonzalez, the army and PNC intelligence
services are deliberately creating an atmosphere of mistrust in the
country in order that the government can justifiably carry out a
security clampdown to stifle opposition to its widely disliked
economic program.

However, FMLN deputy, Miguel Saenz Varela has suggested that the
military maneuvers were indeed indicative of a coup attempt in the
making.  According to Saenz, it is not the government seeking to
clamp down on its opposition that has resulted in the increased
tensions within the country, but unidentified forces who are intent
on discrediting the transition to democracy.

For its part, the army refutes suggestions it would be party to any
coup attempt.  Defense Minister General Humberto Corado said that the
military regretted the death that had accompanied the PNC action
against the former soldiers, but pointed out that the overriding
priority for authorities was the restoration of order.  Without that,
said Corado, "regretful consequences for the country" might ensue.
The deafeningly loud unspoken message seemed to be that such
regretful consequences would of course be avoided were the army to
establish military rule.

Despite Corado's insistence that that is not the army's aim, his
explanation of the military presence in the capital, which included
the "buzzing" of the Presidential Palace, seems a little thin.  He
claims the soldiers were there as part of a military sporting event.
He offered no explanation as to why those who, presumably, should
either have been spectators or competitors, were driving armored
trucks through the streets of San Salvador.  Given that no coup has
yet taken place, however,  it is perhaps reasonable to assume that
any, purely coincidental, messages that were given by the military's
actions have been taken on board by Calderon.

GUATEMALA
POLITICS

The people of Guatemala went to the polls on November 12 to elect a
new president from a field of no less than nineteen hopefuls.
Polling was said to have taken place without incident as guerrillas
of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) made good on
their promise of a unilateral two week cease-fire in order to allow
the election process to take place undisturbed.

In a somewhat rare show of reliability, opinion poll ratings that put
Alvaro Arzu of the right-wing National Advancement Party (PAN) and
Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front Party (FRG) as
the two front runners were proved correct.

Arzu, a popular former mayor of Guatemala City who comes from a
wealthy family and is heavily pro-business, took 36.5% of the vote.
Portillo, running as the front-man for FRG leader Efrain Rios Montt,
came in second with 22.1%.  The remainder of the vote was divided
amongst the confusing array of candidates that had never really stood
much chance.  These included a former defense minister who had been
found guilty of human rights abuses by a US court and an former
attorney-general who was remanded in custody under the last
government for swindling his aunt.

Despite winning the poll, Azru failed to gain the 50% of the vote
necessary to avoid a rerun.  This has been scheduled for January 7.
The likelihood is that Azru will be successful on that occasion.
While Portillo is a fellow conservative, he suffers from a degree of
guilt by association in that Montt is barred from standing in his own
right because of his 17 month long de facto rule in 1982-83.  That
period has been described by some as one of the most brutal periods
of Guatemalan history.

The relatively low turnout, at just 40% of the 3.7 million eligible
to vote was blamed in part on the large number of candidates causing
confusion amongst the electorate.  Hopefully, with the field a little
clearer for the January poll, there will be an increased interest in
what is only the country's third presidential election since it
gained independence in 1986.

At the time of this report, no agreement has been reached with the
URNG concerning an additional cease-fire to cover the run-off
election.  Despite pleas to extend the cease-fire past the November
13 cutoff, the URNG refused.  The guerrilla organization did,
however, say that it was ready to negotiate a permanent bilateral
truce with the government and that its commitment to achieving that
end was proven by the peaceful election period.  The organization has
said that it supports neither candidate in the run-off, but there is
little likelihood of disruption to voting.

The transitional government of current President Ramiro de Leon
Carpio will leave office on January 14 when the winner of the run-off
will take over for a four year term.

MEXICO
POLITICS

The problems being experienced by the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the wake of the late 1994 devaluation
crisis were underlined once again in October when Manuel Camacho,
former Mayor of Mexico City and once-upon-a-time likely candidate to
succeed President Zedillo, resigned from the party.

In explaining his resignation, Camacho said that he was not in favor
of cosmetic electoral reform intended to artificially prolong the
PRI's time in office.  Rather, said Camacho, he is interested in real
political change and the advancement of democracy.  He intends to
form a new coalition to achieve this out of what he sees as the
disaffected groups within both the PRI and the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD).

How successful he will be remains to be seen.  Despite suffering
severe criticism and several high profile gubernatorial election
defeats since the devaluation crisis, the PRI is still a fairly
cohesive unit.  The party responded to its poor electoral showings by
making several personnel changes in August 1995 in an attempt to
revitalize grassroots support.  Recent elections at the municipal
level suggest that while a resurgence in PRI support has not yet
arrived, the rot has perhaps been stopped.  While it is true to say
that the PRI is struggling to become more of a political party and
less of a tool of the President, it is not currently likely to break
down to the extent that would be necessary for Camacho to create a
realistic alternative.

The PRI does suffer from the fact that it has, in the past, been held
together more by power and patronage than by a common ideology.  This
has been underlined by the, almost meteoric, rise in popularity of
the National Action Party (PAN).  In common with many left-wing
parties over the last couple of years, the PRD has suffered something
of an identity crisis which has translated itself into poor electoral
results and caused a deal of internal division for the party.  The
lack of ideological direction on the part of the PRI has led a
fundamentally conservative electorate to move to the right, and into
the waiting arms of the PAN.  The PAN's capitalization on the right
wing mood of the population has further consolidated its ideological
position.  The PRD has seen its support dwindle, but it appears that
the party has rallied round its leaders in spite of the tensions that
this has brought.

Given that both the PRI and the PRD seem to be wrestling with their
problems but staying pretty much together, and that the popular
ground is being seized by the PAN, it is difficult to see just where
Camacho might find room to form a power base.  It is the PAN that has
stolen the governorships from the PRI and the likelihood is that,
come the congressional elections in 1997, it will be the PAN that
presents to biggest problem for the PRI.  How well the PRI stands up
to the challenge will depend, in large part, on how successful it is
in remodeling itself into a modern political party in the meantime.

MEXICO
ECONOMY

The government launched its Alliance for Economic Recovery at the
beginning of November in a bid to aid recovery and provide leeway for
increased social and investment spending while remaining within its
target of a balanced budget for 1996.

Under the plan, which was reached in conjunction with trade union and
business leaders, the minimum wage will be increased by 21% in two
installments.  The first took place in December 1995 and the second
is due in April this year.  In addition to the wage increase, higher
grants are to be given to the unemployed and further help will be
provided for the temporary jobs program.  Businesses will receive tax
incentives including a commitment to suspend asset taxes for small
and medium-sized business during 1996.  Tax on investment that is
over and above 1995 levels will be waived and tax credits will be
given to companies that take on new workers.

The government has also undertaken to help in the drive toward fiscal
stability by staggering price increases for gas and electricity, both
of which are still currently sold by parastatals.  The government
intends to make a 4.75% cut in real spending during 1996 and is
banking on the increased economic activity that will come as a result
of the Alliance providing the rise in tax revenues necessary to make
additional social spending measures feasible.

The plan has had a mixed reception with some economists worried about
the reliance on growth to ensure increased tax receipts.  According
to Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, the measures will mean a fiscal
relaxation of about 0.5% GDP which will not be enough to push the
government off its balanced budget target.  The plan is aimed at an
inflation rate on the year of 20% and growth of 3% of GDP.  Ortiz is
of the opinion that recovery will be export led and that this sector
will provide growth of 1.4 percentage points.  Given that the
government expects an export volume growth of 12% and a value growth
of 18% in US dollar terms, the peso is expected to strengthen.  No
figures for such a strengthening have been released, however.  The
government has simply said that the floating rate will continue.

Confidence in the currency's ability to achieve additional value and
survive a floating exchange rate system got off to a poor start.  The
peso plunged to its lowest ever level against the US dollar just
seven days after the government announced the Alliance.  A ten point
interest rate rise did nothing to strengthen the currency as it came
under increased pressure from speculators and the Central Bank was
force to intervene several times to defend it.  Even then, such
defense was unable to stop the currency losing close to one fifth of
its value against the US dollar in the space of two weeks.

Further distressing news for the government came toward the end of
November with figures being released that suggest that the Mexican
economy is continuing to contract at a worrying rate.  According to
the figures, GDP fell by 9.6% in the third quarter of 1995 compared
to 1994.  This followed a second quarter decline of 10.5%.  The
figures suggest that the government's estimate of a 5.5% contraction
for 1995 may prove to be optimistic.  Should that be the case, the
target figure for next year's recovery may slip beyond reach.

NICARAGUA
FINANCE

Finance Minister, Emilio Pereira, has announced that Nicaragua has no
chance of meeting its 1995 targets for an Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) operating under the IMF's stopgap loan
program.

The first of these targets was a reduction of the deficit in net
international reserves that was adjusted up to US$21,6 million.  Up
to October this year, however, these reserves were in deficit to the
tune of US$115.2 million.  According to Pereira, the situation is
better than it was last year, but he recognizes that the continuing
deficit in international reserves threatens the country's
macroeconomic stability.  The reason for the lack of progress in this
area is, according to Pereira, due to unspecified problems with the
Nicaraguan Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute (Telcor).

Another indicator that the government will not be able to meet the
stopgap loan agreements is the fact that the net internal credit to
the non-financial public sector was not to exceed Nc308.4 million by
December 31.  However, reports issued by the Economic Studies
Management of the Central Bank registered credits to this sector of
Nc748.3 million up to November 9.  This put the government Nc439.9
million off target with more than a month to go to the deadline.

Finally, the National Development Bank was supposed to deposit US$30
million a month into the Central Bank from October.  The US$60
million that should, therefore, have arrived by the end of November
failed to do so.

The fact that these three goals have not been met makes it likely,
according to Pereira, that the IMF will withdraw its help at the
beginning of 1996.

PANAMA
POLITICS

The prospect of a continued US military presence in Panama after 1999
looks less certain after the postponement of talks between the two
countries aimed at coming to an agreement over the terms of an
extension.

Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed during former US president
Jimmy Carter's term of office, the US presence that the Hay-Buneau
Varilla Treaty granted in perpetuity in 1903 must come to an end in
the year 2000.  Talks aimed at an extension of this period began in
September 1995.  There was immediate confusion as to which side had
initiated the talks.  Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares
insisted that it was the USA that broached the subject, but this is
widely believed to have been a face-saving exercise on his part as
pressure began to build over the imminent loss of one of the major
planks in the Panamanian economy.

Balladares has explained the postponement in terms of it being a bad
time for the USA to deal with the issue given the problems it is
having over the budget.  This again, however, is likely to be less
than the whole story.  In reality, it is more likely that Balladares
has asked for far too much of what he terms "clear economic benefits"
for Panama that are the prerequisite for him considering a continued
foreign military presence in his country.

Opinion polls suggest that 75% of Panamanians want the US troops to
stay.  The US military presence pumps around US$400 million into the
country's tiny economy each year and supports some 18,000 jobs.
Official unemployment is at 14% but the true figure is probably
double that.  In addition, the country's traditional sources of
income have come under threat over recent years.  Once a thriving
offshore banking center, international insistence that rules be
tightened to stem the flow of dirty money being laundered in the
country have put paid to much of that sector.  Meanwhile,
deregulation in the USA has damaged Panama's erstwhile equally
successful shipping and insurance sectors, while the entry of Sweden,
Finland and Austria into the European Union's controlled banana
market has reduced exports of what was the country's biggest foreign
exchange earner by 20% this year.  Balladares is not really in a
position to demand rent from the USA in return for allowing it to
continue to prop up the economy, but it would appear that demand it
he has.

In fairness, it is understandable that Balladares should want a
better deal for Panama.  It was, after all the USA which, first
through sanctions and then through its invasion to remove former
dictator Manuel Noriega, devastated the economy in the first place.
Estimates put the real cost to Panama at US$4-6 billion.  US economic
aid since the 1989 invasion totals a mere US$700 million in
comparison, and the situation has not been helped by Panamanian banks
losing a further US$2 billion during the Mexican devaluation crisis
of 1994.

However, there is a good chance that talks will resume and that some
compromise will be made because Panama has the Canal and that is of
considerable strategic importance to the USA.  About 13,000 ships use
the Canal each year and this figure is growing at an annual 2%.  With
President Clinton pushing for even greater levels of free trade
within the Americas, that figure is set to rise over the next decade.
Given that, the USA will almost certainly be back to talk to
Balladares, but for the meantime, it would appear that he has
overstepped the mark and the US administration has decided to give
him a little time to reflect on his country's situation.

JANUARY 1996

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
POLITICS

It would not be entirely undeserved for President Bill Clinton to
allow himself a smile of satisfaction in the privacy of the Oval
office over the events of the last two months.  He has received a
considerable boost to his opinion poll ratings ahead of next year's
presidential election; he is not, again according to latest opinion
poll results, being held responsible for the increasingly
dangerous-looking budget battle; He has brokered possibly the most
important peace deal in Europe since the end of the Second World War;
and secured an advance in the peace talks in Northern Ireland.  And,
last but not least, the only man who has so far looked remotely
likely to present a challenge to his continuation in office next year
has decided not to run for the Republican presidential nomination.

That is not, however, to say that problems do not remain.  Most
pressing of these is the battle between Clinton and the Republican
party over the 1996 budget and extension of the current federal debt
ceiling of US$4,900 billion.

A late November compromise between the protaganists has ensured that
government funding continued until mid-December, but it is
essentially superficial and agreement on the real issues that lie
behind opposing spending suggestions remains some way off.  Tension
over the budget stand-off increased substantially in mid-November
when some 800,000 federal employees were sent home.  This came as a
result of the failure of the two sides to reach agreement on a
compromise over the passage of appropriations bills, which contain
Republican spending cuts, to areas that Clinton is determined to
protect.  Visitors choosing to see the sights had picked a bad day,
as both the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty were closed to the
public.  Rather more importantly, staff responsible for ensuring the
payment of pensions and some other state benefits were laid off,
leaving many Americans in difficult financial circumstances.

In order to ease the situation, Clinton did sign some appropriations
bills for individual departments.  This resulted in some government
workers returning to their posts, but did nothing to end the impasse
over the "reconciliation" bill passed by the House of
Representatives.  That bill includes some US$245 billion in tax cuts
and reforms of the social security net, both of which Clinton
continues to refuse to sign.

The compromise that gave rise to a continuation of government funding
for all departments until December 15 was reached when Clinton agreed
to the signing of a non-binding Congressional resolution that the
federal budget be balanced by 2002.  This seven year period for the
removal of the budget deficit has been the central feature of
Republican budget proposals.  Clinton's apparent climb-down from his
earlier suggestion of a 10 year period for balancing the budget was,
in fact, something of a non-move in that the depth of cuts required
to achieve the seven year target depend quite heavily on which
economic growth figures for the period are used.  Congress insists on
using projections made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and
their spending cuts rely on these figures.  The Clinton
administration, however, has its own set of figures that are less
pessimistic than those of the CBO, and would, as a result, require
less damaging cuts than those proposed by the Republicans.

The agreement made by Clinton does not, however, give the last word
on these projections to the CBO.  Rather, Clinton has said that he is
prepared to balance the budget over seven years, but only in
conjunction with figures resulting from an administration and private
sector review of the CBO projections.  Given the 4.2% growth in GNP
in the last quarter of 1995, the projections resulting from such a
joint enterprise are likely to be a deal more optimistic than those
currently available from the CBO.  The difference is of great
importance in that some estimates suggest that it could result in a
reduction in planned Republican spending cuts of hundreds of billions
of dollars over the forecast period.

Further to that, the text of the agreement quite clearly includes
provision for the "protection of future generations" by means of
ensuring the solvency of Medicare, the adequate funding of Medicaid
and the promotion of "tax policies for the working poor".  This
latter is a reference to the Earned Income Tax Credit system which
Republicans want to get rid of.  Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker in
the Lower House and architect of the Republican spending cuts has
accepted that the agreement puts the centerpiece US$245 billion tax
cut policy very much back on the negotiating table.

Meanwhile, attempts to overcome the impasse over the raising of the
federal debt ceiling before the USA defaults on its international
obligations have met with less success.  This is the other area in
which Republicans have attempted to link, to Clinton, unpalatable
legislation to the debt extension bill in order to force through
their wishes.  Crisis was averted in November when Treasury
Secretary, Robert Rubin, converted US$61.3 billion worth of
non-marketable treasury bonds into cash and auctioned a further US$48
billion worth of Treasury bills in order to cover the US$102 billion
worth of debt that came due.  This situation cannot go on forever,
however.  Rubin remains confident that the Treasury can get through
December by such methods, but crunch time will arrive in mid-January.

The political fallout from these issues looks to be landing squarely
on the Republicans at present.  Opinion polls suggest that twice as
many Americans support Clinton's refusal to bow to Republican
pressure than disagree with it.

This is just one more indicator of the problems being faced by a
Republican party that seems increasingly to be wide of the mark of
public opinion.  Following the decision of General Colin Powell not
to stand for the Republican presidential nomination, the party looked
toward Gingrich as a possible candidate to consolidate the image of a
floundering opposition.  He too, however, has declined such
invitations.  Given his plummeting popularity ratings over the last
few weeks, the Republican party might now breathe a sigh of relief
that he has chosen not to spearhead their presidential bid.  Pressure
would appear to be getting to Gingrich.  His recent outbursts include
blaming the welfare state for a particularly horrific triple murder
and admitting to allowing perceived snubs on board the presidential
plane on route to the funeral of assassinated Israeli leader, Yitzhak
Rabin, to play a part in his decision to bring government to a
standstill.  Such respectively ludicrous and petulant behavior has
done little to endear him to a public which has already signaled its
distaste over his attacks on the most vulnerable within American
society.

In addition, Gingrich faces investigation over charges of violating
campaign finance laws filed against him by the Federal Election
Commission.  According to the FEC, an organization called the Grand
Old Party Action Committee (Gopac), chaired by Gingrich since 1986
and used by him as a vehicle for regenerating the party's grass roots
support, channeled some US$250,000 into Gingrich's campaign for
reelection as a congressman in Georgia in 1990.  This, says the FEC,
was illegal because Gopac did not formally register as a federal
political action committee.  If found guilty, Gingrich stands to be
fined a considerable amount, not to mention the damage to whatever
political standing he has remaining at that time.

So, with Gingrich out of the frame, the Republican party's only
obvious hope for the presidency now lies with Senator Robert Dole.
Dole himself, has suffered something of a setback recently though.
In a straw poll in Florida amongst 3,300 registered Republicans that
is widely regarded as the start of the nominations process, Dole took
an unconvincing 33% of the vote.  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas came in
second with 26% and former Tennessee governor, Lamar Alexander,
polled 22.5%.  The fact that Dole was unable to secure a greater
percentage lead over his supposedly little-hoper opponents can only
present further worries for the Republican party as a whole.

These worries must have been heightened yet further by the party's
poor showing in off-year elections throughout the country.  Despite
being convinced that for the first time since the civil war,
Republicans would control both chambers in the Virginia legislature,
the Democrats retained their 52-47 majority in the lower house and
drew 20-20 with the Republicans in the state senate.  The casting
vote in the senate goes, however, to a Democrat.  Similar results
were posted in several other polls, but the Republicans did hold on
to the governorship of Kirk Fordice in Mississippi.

All this is, of course, cheering news to Clinton.  Provided the
president is able to secure the welfare system protection he wants
while still reducing the period in which the deficit will be cleared
to seven years, both approved by the electorate, he will have
achieved an important compromise that could well ensure his return to
office.

Clinton is not unassailable, however. Implementation of the so-called
Dayton peace agreement signed between the Presidents of Bosnia,
Serbia and Croatia in Paris in mid December will require the presence
of some 20,000 US troops to be deployed in Bosnia.  This is
particularly contentious domestically.  A majority of Republicans,
and probably a majority of the American people, fear a re-ignition of
the war in Bosnia that will result in the deaths of many US
servicemen.

Clinton has achieved wide recognition for his part in the brokerage
of the deal, but his decision to send troops could well backfire
should considerable US casualties ensue.  While it is traditional for
the electorate to rally round a President in conflict situations, the
last thing Clinton will want to see in an election year is large
numbers of body-bags returning home.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ECONOMY

Discussion over the possibility of an interest rate cut surfaced
again in November following the release of economic indicator figures
that suggest that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing.

Industrial production fell in October, with output down by 0.3% to
register its first decline in six months.  Some 0.2% of this decrease
can be attributed to the strike at aircraft maker, Boeing, but
according to analysts, even with this taken into consideration, most
sectors were flat or slightly down.  Output of consumer goods,
business equipment and construction supplies were down by 0.5, 0.8,
and 0.6% respectively.  These figures were reflected in the
Purchasing Managers' Index of manufacturing activity which fell by
0.3% in November to 46.5%.  A figure of below 50% indicates a
contraction in manufacturing and the November figure is the sixth in
seven months to indicate a decline, taking the index closer to the
44.5% figure at which the economy as a whole is said to be in
contraction.

Consumer confidence figures as measured by the New York business
analysis group, The Conference Board, remain strong.  The Board's
figure for November rose to 101.4 as against 96.3 in October.
Readings of above 100 have traditionally been associated with periods
of rapid economic growth.  The apparent strength of confidence among
consumers is not, however, expected to translate itself into high
retail sales figures for Christmas.  The Commerce Department
registered a 0.2% decline in sales in October .  According to the
department, high levels of indebtedness will prevent consumer
confidence boosting this position for the time being.

As for inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3% in
October as a result of sharp increases in the cost of housing, energy
and clothing.  The core CPI, which discounts food and energy prices,
also showed a 0.3% rise.  Despite most economists now believing that
the economy is slowing and will probably only post a quite moderate
2.4% GDP growth figure for 1996, the possibility of upward pressure
on inflation still makes imminent cuts in interest rates unlikely.
The Fed is not known for impulsive moves and, in our opinion,
decisions on whether or not to give the economy a moderate boost will
not take place until early next year.

Foreign Trade
Sluggish domestic demand has been held responsible for a second
consecutive fall in the US monthly trade deficit figures.  The
commerce department said that the deficit fell to US$8.3 billion in
September as against expectations that it would be as high as US$9.5
billion.  This comes on top of the fall in August to US$8.4 billion.

Within the figures lurks a decline in the bilateral deficit with
Japan, subject of much disagreement between the two countries of
late, from US$5.1 billion to US$4.3 billion, its lowest level in two
years.

Exports rose 1.6% between August and September to US$67.2 billion.
This more than offset the percentage rise, at 1.4%, of imports which
increased in value to US$75.6 billion.  Exports were 10.3% higher
than in the September 1994 and imports were up by 8.4% over the same
period.  The deficit was US$90 billion for the first nine months of
1995, up from US$78.7 billion over the same period in 1994.  A
deficit of US$136.8 billion in goods was partially offset by a
US$46.8 surplus on trade in services.

CZECH REPUBLIC
POLITICS

With the next general election now scheduled for May 31 and June 1
this year, Prime Minister Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) has
moved to strengthen its position by merging with the Christian
Democratic Party (KDS).  The ODS was already the largest party in
parliament, but it remains to be seen how effective the merger will
be.

The problem is with the Club of Committed Non-Party Members (KAN),
which was closely allied to the KDS.  Although the leadership of the
KAN supported the merger with the ODS, the bulk of the membership did
not.  As a result, although the KDS members voted overwhelmingly for
the merger, 69 KAN members did not.  When the vote was carried the
KAN membership voted to abrogate the partnership agreement with the
KDS.  KAN chairman, Emil Dejmek, who supported the ODS-KDS merger,
was forced to resign, along with other members of the KAN leadership,
and was replaced by Pavel Holba.

On the left of the political spectrum, the Left Bloc (LB) has
announced that it intends to contest the election independently.
This means that three parties will now be competing to capture the
left vote in the elections - the LB, the Communist Party of Bohemia
and Moravia and the Czech Social Democratic Party.

According to LB chairman, Jaroslav Ortman, the party intends to spend
Ccr19 million (about US$731,000) in its election campaign.

Another complication for the political establishment is the decision
to transform the current unicameral legislature into a bicameral
system with an upper and lower chamber.  Under this amendment to the
constitution agreed by parliament last year, the existing single
chamber - the 200-member National Council - will become the lower
chamber and a new upper chamber, the Senate, will be created by
direct election.

However, the parties in the coalition government are unable to agree
on whether the Senate elections should be held simultaneously with or
separately from the lower chamber elections.   Josef Lux, the leader
of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party
(KDU-CSL) and Jan Kalvoda, the leader of the Civic Democratic
Alliance (ODA) have argued that the two elections should be held
separately, while Prime Minister Klaus and his ODS favor holding the
two elections simultaneously.

Relations between the ODS and the ODA have been poor through most of
the current governments' term, and it would appear that Klaus is
depending on the merger with the KDS to counteract any gains made by
the ODA in the upcoming election.

The current representation of the parties in parliament (with the
coalition parties indicated by an asterisk) is as follows: Civic
Democratic Party-Christian Democratic Party (ODS-KDS*), 84; Czech
People's Party-Christian Democratic Union (CSL-KDU)*, Civic
Democratic Alliance (ODA)*, Left Bloc (LB), 35; Czech Social
Democratic Party (CSSD), 16; Liberal Social Union (LSU), 13; 15; 14;
Movement for Self-Governing Democracy  in  Moravia and Silesia
(HSDMS), 9; Republican Party (SOR-RSC), 8; Liberal National Social
Party, 6.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Klaus has suggested that the government be
slimmed down after this year's election through the abolition of a
number of ministries, including the culture and economic ministries.
He argued that a culture ministry was not needed as the tasks it
carries out can easily be taken over by other ministries.  On the
economic side, he argues that a Privatization Ministry, Economy
Ministry, Industry and Trade Ministry and Ministry for Economic
Competition is excessive.  In his view at least two of these could
go.

Racial/Ethic Tensions
Last year, the Interior Ministry reported that racial persecution is
being directed to an ever greater extent against Romanies, or
Gypsies.

According to the ministry, attacks on Arabs or blacks are sporadic,
and there is no evidence of increasing racially motivated criminal
activity against Vietnamese or Jews.  However, attacks against
Romanies appears to be on the rise.

The ministry puts the responsibility for most of the racially
motivated attacks on members of the skinhead movement, which unites
around 1,500 young people.  However, the ministry is unable to
identify which of the numerous skinhead factions actually organizes
the attacks.

According to the ministry, the numerically strongest and most
important skinhead factions - the Patriot League, Bohemia Hammer
Skins, the National Socialist Movement and the National Fascist
Community - tend to restrain their activities to organizing meetings
and concerts or to publishing printed material that indirectly
prompts attacks on Romanies.

The most frequent occurrence of racially motivated activity has been
noted in Prague and northern Bohemia, while it has been falling in
southern Moravia and eastern Bohemia.  In 1994, police investigated
up to 160 racially motivated conflicts, of which 130 were criminal
offenses.

As a result of the sharp increase in racially motivated crimes, the
penal code was amended on September 1 last year to increase the
penalties available for racially motivated crimes.

Social Conditions
The government has increased the subsistence level by an average of
8% as from 1st January 1996.  Given that inflation is different in
various areas, the government reckons the amount "per individual"
will be increased by 7%, while the amount including expenditure on
joint household needs will be increased by 13%.

When fully implemented, the increase will cost Ccr3.2 billion (US$123
million) this year.  The last increase in the subsistence level was
at the beginning of 1995.

Meanwhile, the republic continues to enjoy one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the world.  There were 146,000 people
registered as unemployed at the end of October, equivalent to an
unemployment rate of just 2.8%.  Overall, there were 9,200 fewer
unemployed than in September and 31,000 fewer than in January 1995.

Of the total of 146,000 unemployed, 68,200 (46.7%) received
unemployment benefits worth Ccr1.35billion (US$52 million), 88,000
were women, 22,000 had limited work capabilities and 22,000 were
college graduates.  At the same time, there were over 94,000 job
vacancies.

The highest unemployment rate - 7% - was in the northern Bohemian
district of Most.  The districts of Karvina in northern Moravia and
other northern Bohemian districts of Teplice, Louny and Chomutov
recorded an unemployment rate of over 6%.

Population
The Czech Republic's birth rate was lower than its mortality rate in
1994 for the first time in the republic's history.  According to the
Czech Statistical Office, the social and economic changes wrought by
the transformation process have substantially changed the
reproductive behavior of the people and brought demographic changes
in the Czech Republic into line with those in West European
countries.

One positive feature of this development has been the reduced number
of abortions.  In comparison with 1992, the number of abortions has
dropped by 38.3% last year.  The average marrying age for the Czechs
is also higher, while the divorce rate remains virtually unchanged.

CZECH REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

The Czech Republic became a member of the OECD on November 28 last
year - the first of the post-communist countries to do so.  Although
membership will not bring any direct increase in   economic
assistance it does set a massive seal of approval on the government's
management of the economy since the establishment of the state in
January 19xx and confirms Republic's lead among the former European
members of Comecon.

In line with the OECD stamp of approval, the credit rating agency
Standard & Poor's upgraded its foreign currency debt ratings for the
Czech National Bank and the City of Prague by two points from BBB+ to
A, raising the outlook for both institutions from "positive" to
"stable".

The latest estimates put last year's GDP growth at 4.1%, compared
with 2.6% in 1994 and a forecast 5% plus this year.

Industrial output growth accelerated to 7.8% in the fist nine months
of last year, compared with an annual growth of 2.1% in 1994. The
overall growth rate for 1995 is estimated at 7-7.5%, but a slight
slowdown to 5.5-7% is expected this year.

While the 8% growth rate in construction forecast for 1995 will be
half a percentage point higher than in 1994, a slight fall to 7-8% is
expected this year.  Labor productivity growth has been greatest in
industry and the construction, rising by 8-9% last year.

Domestic demand in real terms grew by 5.1% in the first half of 1995
while external demand grew by 4.4%.  The rate of investment in the
first half of last year was 23.6% in current prices.  The estimate
for the whole year is around 30%.  The rate of engineering
investments was twice that of the rate of investment in construction.
Household savings have been stable at 10-11% of disposable incomes.
No major change is expected in this sector this year.

Inflation
Inflation remains a pressing concern.  As Prime Minister Klaus
pointed out last year, the transformation "cushion" set up in 1991
and which allowed real wages to grow by more than the GDP is no
longer sustainable.  The cushion was created by the liberalization of
prices and trade and the devaluation of the currency, but the room
for maneuver they provided has now been exhausted.

That means, said Klaus, that henceforth real wages must not be
allowed to grow at a greater rate than the GDP if domestic price
rises are to be kept in line with foreign prices.  He pointed out
that up to now the government had consciously set the level of
devaluation, but that too little control had been exercised over
prices.  As a result they had soared.  The rise in prices which began
in the second quarter of 1990 and accelerated after price
liberalization in January 1991 pushed real wages down in the second
quarter of 1991 to 69% of their levels at the beginning of 1990.
This year, said Klaus, real wages should approach the levels of early
1990, while inflation should be around 7.5%.

According to the Czech Statistics Office, inflation in retail prices
is slowing, but only modestly when compared to the acceleration of
economic growth.

After a 10% rise in retail prices in 1994, the rise was a little
slower at 9.7% in the first six months of last year. Prices of food
and public catering rose more than 14% in the first half of last
year, while prices of services rose by 8.3% and prices of other goods
by 6.9%.  The increase in food prices was primarily influenced by the
rising prices of potatoes, meat products and coffee.  The prices of
services were affected by adjustments to government regulated prices
during the first half of the year, including prices for heat,
postage, telephone service, railway fares, energy and gas.

Nevertheless, the moderation in the annual inflation rate continued
through the year with a rate of 9.5% recorded in the first nine
months.  The overall projection for 1995 is an inflation rate of
around 9.5%.

Agriculture
A slight growth in gross agricultural production is expected last
year, following several years of decline.  According to the hectare
yields and crops assessment from the end of October last, basic grain
crops should reach 6.7 million tonnes, a drop of 0.9 % on 1994.  The
wheat yields will be 4.1% higher, but the yields of rye, barley and
oats will be lower than in 1994.

The production of potatoes is expected to be 1.4 million tonnes, an
increase of 14.3% compared with 1994.  The rape crop is expected to
reach 664,000 tonnes, some 46% higher, while sugar beet production
for industrial purposes is estimated to reach 3.5 million, an
increase of 9% on 1994.

Livestock production was slightly lower last year.  It is estimated
that the numbers of cattle fell by 2% and the number of pigs by 0.5%.
The milk yield increased by 4.3% to 11.3 liters per day in the first
half of 1995 compared to the same period of 1994.  According to the
annual estimate, the sale of milk will decline by 3.5% and the sale
of eggs by 0.4%.

Inward Investment
A package of agreements was signed in November enabling foreign oil
companies a stake in Czech refineries.  The International Oil
Consortium (IOC), comprising Agip of Italy, Royal Dutch/Shell of the
Netherlands and Conoco of the USA, signed up to the deal with the
Czech state-owned Unipetrol joint-stock company to acquire a 49%
stake in the Czech Refinery Company (CRS).

The CRS was formed out of a merger of the refining operations of
Czech refinery giants Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov.  The
remaining 51% share in the CRS stays in the hands of Unipetrol, which
in turn is wholly owned by the National Property Fund.

Banking Sector
The Republic's three largest banks reported high profit growth in the
first nine months of 1995.  Komercni Banka, which declared gross
earnings of Ccr6.8 billion, compared with Ccr2.6 billion for all of
last year, recorded the highest profit growth, followed by Ceska
Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank) with a net profit of Ccr1,194
million, a growth of almost 22% 1994.

The net profit of the third bank, Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB),
was Ccr712 million, 70% of the projected Ccr1 billion in earnings for
this year.  During the same period last year, IPB achieved a net
profit of Ccr584 million while the total for the whole year amounted
to Ccr752 million.

All three banks recorded an equal growth in granted loans and
consequently in reserves.

CZECH REPUBLIC
FINANCE

The state budget ended the first ten months of 1995 with a surplus of
Ccr12.3 billion.  Revenues totaled more than Ccr355 billion and
overall expenditure reached Ccr343.4 billion.  Finance Minister Ivan
Kocarnik said the figures showed the government's overall projections
for the 1995 budget were realistic.  It meant that the prognosis for
the end of the year situation, based on the October figures, was that
revenues to the budget should be met with a possible variation of
plus or minus Ccr1-2 billion.

In November last, the parliamentary budget committee recommended
approval of the proposed state debt of Ccr155.7 billion for 1996.
Deputy Finance Minister Miroslav Havel said the debt's nominal value
will remain the same as in 1995 but its share of the GDP would
decrease from the 13% to 11.2%.  The major tendencies in
administering the state debt are to convert the passive trade balance
with foreign countries into a domestic passive balance and to convert
direct loans to securities, Havel said.

He said the state will buy its receivables in foreign countries and
finance it by issuing bonds and treasury bills at a total value of
Ccr40 billion, which will reduce the amount of foreign debt in the
overall debt from 44% in 1993 to 23% in 1996.  For the first time
since 1993 the state debt will not be financed by the government's
National Property Fund.

The state debt totaled Ccr162.8 billion at the beginning of 1993
(17.3% of GDP).  By the end of 1994, the debt had totaled Ccr157.3
billion.  In 1995, Ccr1.6 billion was paid off from the surplus in
the 1994 state budget, bringing it down to Ccr155.7 billion (13% of
GDP).  If the debts of municipalities, funds and other independent
state institutions are added to the debt, the total share of the GDP
would reach 18%.

Havel claimed that the proposal to issue state securities worth Ccr40
billion this year will not influence the behavior of investors on the
Czech capital market.  At the time of this report, parliament had yet
to discuss the budget committee's recommendation.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade deficit for January-October 1995 stood at Ccr77.4
billion, according to Statistical Office figures.  This is an
increase of Ccr9.2 billion on the January-September period.   Exports
totaled Ccr446.5 billion and imports Ccr369 billion.  In the same
period of 1994, the foreign trade deficit amounted to Ccr8.9 billion.
In October 1995 alone, the deficit stood at Ccr11.9 billion compared
to the deficit of Ccr1.5 billion in October 1994.

Imports grew by 30.2% between January and October 1995 compared to
the same period last year, while exports rose by 10.5%.  Imports of
machines and transport equipment grew by 33.3%, accounting for 35.1%
of total imports.  Passenger cars accounted for 7.5% of total exports
of machines and transport equipment.  Semi-finished products made a
significant contribution to the increase in imports, accounting for
18% of the total.  The volume of imports in this area jumped by 43%
compared with the same period of last year.  Chemical imports
recorded an increase of 33.6%, a share of 13.6% of total imports.

Exports of semi-finished products increased by 19.5% in the
January-October period and accounted for 33% of total exports.
Exports of chemicals rose by 15.9% and accounted for 10.5% of the
total.  Exports of machines and transport vehicles grew 9.9% and made
up 25.6% of all exports.

Overall exports were hit by a drop in exports of industrial products,
mainly consumer goods, which accounted for 12.7% of total exports.
They dropped by 2.7% between January and October 1995 compared to the
same period of 1994.

The volume of foreign trade in agricultural produce increased by 16%
in the January-October period.  However, the Czech Republic's deficit
in this trade amounted to Ccr12 billion, a year-on-year increase of
33%.

Trade with European Union (EU) countries showed a deficit of
Ccr11billion and that there was a Ccr6 billion deficit in trade with
developing countries.  In trade with Slovakia Czech imports rose by
21.1% in the 10-month period to Ccr59.4 billion against exports of
Ccr59.7 billion, to produce a surplus of Ccr300 million, an increase
of 8.6%.  The republic also recorded a surplus with Central European
Free Trade Agreement countries as a whole.

Trade with Russia in the first nine months of 1995 was more than 21%
up on the same period of 1994 and totaled Ccr47billion, according to
preliminary data from the State Statistical Office. Imports from
Russia were worth Ccr36.3billion, a rise of 30%, while exports fell
by 3.4% to Ccr10.6 billion.  Fossil fuels and lubricants accounted
for 77% of the imports.

Exchange Controls
Despite the burgeoning trade deficit, the Czech Republic became the
first of the former European Comecon members to partly liberalize its
capital account transactions on October 1 last year when it
introduced a new foreign exchange act.  The act, which also
introduced full convertibility of the currency for current account
transactions, does not affect the central bank's managed exchange
rate policy.  The value of the crown will continue to be tied to a
currency basket made up of a 65% weighting to the German mark and a
35% weighting to the US dollar. Under this system, the crown is
allowed to fluctuate by 0.5% either side of the set parity.

Under the act, the Ccr100,000 ceiling on the amount of foreign
currency citizens can buy is removed.  In addition, the purchase of
foreign real estate is permitted, companies are allowed to accept
credit from non-resident banks, and some restrictions on direct
investment are eased.  However, other restrictions, such as the ban
on investing in foreign stock markets, remain.  The National Bank's
goal is to achieve full capital account convertibility by the year
2000.

National Bank
The Czech National Bank's (CNB) balance sheet stood at
Ccr530,824,300,000 at the end of October last. The greatest
contribution to the increase in the bank's assets are the greater
outstanding claims on foreign countries, which have increased to
Ccr70,146,800,000.  In addition, receivables from local banks grew
have risen to Ccr72,343,800,000.

Czech National Bank deposits in foreign banks, including securities,
amounted to Ccr258,861,300,000, while other assets amounted to Ccr
5,742,300,000.  Obligations to local banks increased to Ccr
124,613,700,000.  Securities issues were also up at Ccr92,153,000,000
crowns and the volume of obligations for the state budget were also
up at Ccr12,277,300,000 crowns.

Obligations to foreign banks were down at Ccr25,888,600,000 and the
value of issued currency dropped stood at Ccr109,753,300,000.

HUNGARY
POLITICS

The unity of the Socialist led coalition government has been badly
bruised over the last few months.  On the one hand, two ministers
have resigned over their opposition to elements of the tough economic
stabilization plan, while on the other, Finance Minister Lajos Bokros
has threatened to resign over a ruling by the Constitutional Court
that other elements of the recovery plan are unconstitutional.

The first minister to resign, on October 6, was the Labor Minister,
Magda Kovacs Kosa, one of Prime Minster Horn's most experienced
ministers.  Clearly loath to see her go, Horn initially refused to
accept her resignation and pleaded with her to stay on.  However,
Kosa, a former trade union leader in the communist era, was adamant.
In particular she opposed the cuts in sick pay provision put forward
in the restructuring program.

Prime Minister Horn finally accepted the unavoidable on November 28
and replaced Kosa with Peter Kiss, a 36-year old mechanical engineer,
and Socialist Party deputy.  Kiss held senior posts in the Communist
Youth Union (CYU)  and was a founding member of the Progressive Youth
Association (PYU), which was set up when the CYU was wound up in
1989.  He was chairman of the PYU from 1992 to 1995.  He has been a
Socialist member of parliament since 1992.

In the meantime, Education Minister Gabor Fodor resigned on November
24, although he agreed to stay on until the 1996 budget is settled.
On making the announcement, Fodor said he was leaving because he did
not agree with a number of decisions made by the government and
because he did not receive enough support from the prime minister.
He was particularly unhappy that the 1996 budget allocation for
public education is to be cut by Hf7 billion and that further
redundancies are planned in higher education. Fodor is a member of
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDZS), the junior member of the
coalition.  He is likely to be replaced by another SZDZS member.

However, what could be the hardest blow for Prime Minister Horn's
hopes of pressing ahead with his recovery program came on November 22
when Finance Minister Lajos Bokros offered his resignation.  Bokros's
move, clearly one of exasperation, came after the Constitutional
Court ruled that his move to increase housing loan rates from 15% to
25% was unlawful.  This was the fourth time the Constitutional Court
had ruled that certain measures in the economic stabilization package
are unconstitutional.

Prime Minister Horn refused to accept Bokros' resignation.  Bokros
responded by putting a set of conditions for his continuation as
finance minister and said that whether or not he stays on depends on
the extent to which these demands are met.  In particular he wants
the parliamentary groups of the two government parties the means by
which he can manage the economy without continually running foul of
the constitution.  That means, he said, that the role of every basic
institution has to be reassessed, including interest coordination.
He also wants a compulsory declaration of assets, as he believes
financial savings should be encouraged, while the accumulation of
real estate as a form of investment should not

In essence, Bokros' demands can only be met through fundamental
amendments to the constitution.  That a new constitution is needed
has been long recognized, but little has been done to address the
problem so far.  However, Bokros' latest intervention has reawakened
the debate, with Prime Minister Horn saying it is vital that
preparatory work for a new constitution should start at the beginning
of this year at the latest.

Not surprisingly, the harsh effects of the recovery package has split
the Socialist Party, with its more left-wing members arguing for a
softening of the measures.  So far, however, Horn has remained
adamant that the policy must be kept on track.  This division between
the two wings of the party led to the resignation of Sandor
Czintalan, the executive deputy chairman of the party on November 24,
with effect from this year.

Social Conditions
In November last year, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) published
its first detailed statistical analysis on the economic transition
process.  The study shows that the GDP shrank by one quarter between
1990 and 1994.

Between 1990 and 1995, Hungary received the largest share (US$9.2
billion) of the working capital invested in the transition economies
in Eastern Europe and obtained the largest proportion of joint
ventures.  In the summer of 1995, more than 800,000 private
entrepreneurs were registered in the country, 15% of the active
population.  However, the KSH estimates that 30-40% of private
businesses were set up purely for "tax alleviation".

The age structure of the population is out of balance.  Some 24.8% of
the population is 55 or older, and 34% is below the age of 24.
However, while the middle age group, which makes up only 28.3% of the
population, has to carry the bulk of the taxation and expenditure
burden, it also suffers the highest unemployment and death rates.

Average life expectancy at birth is also falling.  In the case of men
this was 65.9 years in 1960, but only 64.5 years in 1994.  The life
expectancy of women is better at 73.8 years.

Over the 1990-1994 period, the number of people in registered
employment fell by 1.4 million, about 25%. The unemployment rate last
year was 10-11%.  Unemployment is highest among young people at the
beginning of their careers: 23% among women and 31% among men.
Economic activity is overall is 57% (62.6% in the case of men and
51.8% among women).  The employment proportions are distorted by the
fact that, between 1990 and 1995, the number of pensioners working
part or full time decreased by 60% while the number of people in
early retirement or retirement due to disability increased by 15%.

The real income of the population decreased gradually from 1990 to
1993, at which time it stood at 93.3% of the 1985 level.  Real
incomes rose by 3.7% in 1994, but are estimated to have fallen by 11%
in real terms last year.

Inflation, the decrease of real incomes, the increased number of
dependents and falling consumption show a large degree of
differentiation in incomes.  The difference between the smallest and
highest average incomes is more than seven-fold.  In 1994, 45.9% of a
household's income came from the main place of employment.  This
indicates that in an "average family", welfare and illegal incomes
have become dominant.  According to the household panel surveys, some
25% of the population lived below subsistence level in 1994.  People
on low income spent 35.6% of their total spending on food and around
20% on housing.  The proportions are believed to have continued to
deteriorate last year.

However, the data also indicate that from a "quality of life"
viewpoint, the housing situation, telephone supply, the general
possibility to use infrastructural services, the number of cars per
family, and the construction of holiday homes have significantly
improved in the past five years.

The population's health has deteriorated; the proportion of smokers
and alcoholics has soared; and the proportion of people having to
rely on various welfare provisions has increased.   Public safety has
also deteriorated continually since 1990, and the proportion of
violent acts and economic crimes has been increasing among criminal
acts.

HUNGARY
ECONOMY

Despite the considerable pain being inflicted, the austerity package,
introduced in March last year, is bearing fruit.  The GDP is
estimated to have grown by around 2.5% last year, with improvements
in the budget, trade, and current account deficits.  However, there
are indications that the sharp improvements seen in the first half of
the year, started to slow in the second half.

After 8.3% growth in the first half of 1995, industrial production
increased by 7.4 % in July, 2.7% in August and 2.4% in September,
compared with the same periods in 1994.  Both small and large-scale
enterprises increased their output.  As a result, the volume of
industrial production in the first nine months of 1995 exceeded that
of the same period of 1994 by 6.8%.

Industrial production in September was the equivalent of 78.8% of
industrial production achieved in 1994.  At the same time, the volume
of production in September, based on the index containing all the
enterprises and the seasonal adjustments, was 2.6% lower than that
calculated in August.  With the exception of the chemical industry,
the major processing industry sectors registered a fall in
production.  The biggest drop was registered in metallurgy and metal
processing, where production dropped by 14.3%, but the engineering
industry also registered a considerable drop of 8.3%.

Food, beverages, and tobacco production dropped by 4.6%, compared
with August, while chemical industry production increased by 12%.
Production of the mining industry in September 1995 dropped by 8.5%
compared with September 1994, while electric energy, gas, thermal and
water production registered an increase of 10.1%.

Inflation
In November, the government produced an inflation forecast of "only"
19% this year provided the trade unions accepted pay rises averaging
17-18%.  The government also proposed that the social insurance
contribution to be paid by employees this year should be 12% compared
with 10% last year.  Companies, however, should only have to pay a
40- 41% social insurance contribution, as opposed to the current rate
of 44%.

Also in November, the government and unions reached agreement on a
new tax regime.  Employers, however, are unhappy with the deal
because they consider the top tax rate of 48% on the top band of over
Hf900,000 as excessive.  The tax rate on the bottom band, up to
Hf185,000, is 2%.

Foreign Trade
Helped by a 9% devaluation of the forint and an 8% import surcharge,
introduced as part of the recovery package, exports grew by 40% in
the first nine months of last year against a 29% rise in imports.
Nevertheless, with imports totaling to Hf1,367.4 billion and exports
Hf1,076.8 billion at current prices, the trade deficit for the period
was still Hf1.8 billion more than in 1994 at Hf290.6 billion.

According to the National Bank of Hungary (MNB), imports fell by 3%
and exports rose by 4% in comparative prices against the
corresponding period of 1994.  On its figures, in US dollar terms,
exports in the nine-month period were worth US$9.01 billion, up from
US$5.23 billion in the same period of 1994, while imports increased
to US$11.06 billion, compared with US$7.76 billion.  As a result, the
trade deficit fell from US$2.5 billion in the first nine months of
1994 to US$2.05 billion in the first nine months of 1995.

Yugoslav Embargo
Following the decision of the United Nations' embargo committee to
lift its sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the
Hungarian government lifted its compliant restrictions on November
23.  With effect from that date, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV)
announced that was now prepared to transport goods to and from
Yugoslavia and to allow transit shipments to and from Yugoslavia on
its lines.

At the same time, the Hungarian Oil and Gas Rt (MOL) increased the
amount of Russian natural gas transported to Serbia via the transit
station at Kiskundorozsma in southern Hungary to its pre-embargo
level of 186.5 million cubic meters a month.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade estimates that the embargo imposed
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) on June
3, 1992, has cost Hungary over US$2.2 billion in lost trade.  The
greatest loss, some US$1 billion, was suffered in 1993.  In 1994
Hungary's embargo-related losses amounted to only US$571 million,
while in the first nine months of 1995 they reached some US$300
million.

The losses have been caused partly by a fall in export markets, extra
costs stemming from re-diversion of exports, hindrances to supplies
and cancellation of transit shipments.  A one-off state subsidy of
US$2 million in 1994, issued in a bid to partially compensate firms
for damages caused by the embargo, increased government losses
further.

HUNGARY
FINANCE

In October, the central bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) said
that both Hungary's external payments position and its reserves had
improved significantly, with reserves standing at around US$9.1-9.2
billion.  On that basis the NBH said it had decided to repay US$620
million of its debt to the IMF in November.  Repayment was not due
until the end of 1998.

NBH President Gyoergy Suranyi said the step would improve the
country's debt service ratio and cut interest payments in the coming
years.  As a result of earlier repayment, Hungary's current debt of
slightly more than US$1 billion will fall to US$400 million, which
will be due in and after 1999.  The NBH took up these loans in 1990
and 1991.

The budget deficit picture looks rather less rosy, however.  Under
the austerity package, the budget deficit was supposed to fall to
Hf150 billion last year, equivalent to 6.5% of GDP against 9.5% of
GDP in 1994.  Budget revenue reached a total of Hf1,149.3 billion at
the end of October, and expenditure Hf1,344.9 billion, to produce a
deficit of Hf 195.6 billion.  With the deficit in November and
December expected to be around Hf100-110 billion, the total deficit
for the year could rise to around Hf300-310 billion.

1996 Budget
Finance Minister Bokros presented the draft 1996 budget to parliament
on November 7, with another harsh message for the people.  It was
essential, he said, that there be no rise in the standard of living
this year and that there was a further decrease in incomes in real
terms.  This further belt-tightening was needed, he said, to achieve
the three main aims of the budget - improving the balance of
payments, cutting the budget deficit and public expenditure, and
bringing down inflation.

He said the first economic policy goal is to halt the increase in the
external net debt.  This will require a significant decrease in the
deficit of the balance of payments on the current account, from about
US$2.8 billion in 1995 to less than US$2 billion.  Second, the growth
of internal debts must be slowed significantly.  The budget deficit
target for this year is 4% of GDP.

Exchange Controls
The new foreign exchange regime came into force in January 1, making
the forint a convertible currency as defined by the IMF.  As the
forint was already convertible as far as companies' financial
transfers are concerned, the main effect of the new law will be
enabling private individuals to use the forint for the purchase of
services and commodities abroad.

From January 1, Hungarian citizens holding forint cards or registered
savings deposits will have free access to foreign currency abroad.
However, the tourist allowance of US$800 a year remains unchanged.
Hungarian companies and businesses are now able to found companies or
acquire stakes in existing ones without any limitation.  The stake of
the Hungarian investor, however, should always exceed 10% of the
assets of the foreign venture.  Also, the company to be founded or
acquired should be based in an OECD member state, with which Hungary
has concluded a mutual investment protection agreement.

Hungarian private individuals and businesses wishing to invest in
securities issued abroad will still require a foreign exchange
license.

POLAND
POLITICS

The most interesting feature of the presidential elections on
November 5 and November 19, is not that a former communist
functionary is now the President of Poland, but that Lech Walesa very
nearly secured a second successive term.  When one thinks of quite
how bad he has been as a president - in his five years he engineered
the downfall of seven prime ministers and almost as many governments
while showing an alarming tendency towards authoritarianism -  and
the low esteem in which he has been held by the majority of Poles
over the latter part of his term, that was no mean achievement.

However, that narrow failure was achieved by the same means that
Walesa employed during his presidency - spite, bullying, character
assassination and, last but not least, the unswerving support of the
Catholic church.  It has to be admitted, however, that the eventual
victor, Aleksander Kwasniewski, more than played into Walesa's hands
by being less than candid about his educational background - a silly
pretense in a competition against a man qualified only as a shipyard
electrician, and perhaps an indicator of a suppressed vanity.

Knowing that Kwasniewski was his main challenger, Walesa based his
campaign on one single theme - the threat of a return to communism.
The "reds under the beds" tune was eagerly taken up by the Church,
with priests in every parish lecturing the faithful on the dangers
that stood before them if they were foolish enough to vote the wrong
way.

In the first round of voting on September 27  Kwasniewski gained
35.11% of the vote and Lech Walesa 33.11%.  The other candidates were
Jacek Kuron with 9.22%, Jan Olszewski with 6.86%, Waldemar Pawlak
with 4.31%, Tadeusz Zielinski with 3.53%, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz
with 2.76%, and Janusz Korwin-Mikke with 2.40%.

From then on the heat was turned up under Kwasniewski, who suddenly
found himself being required to account for his personal finances and
the posts he filled in the communist era. Aged 41 and married with
one daughter, Kwasniewski was an activist in the communist Socialist
Union of Polish Students (SZSP) and joined the communist party, the
Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in 1977.  In 1980-81 he was made
a member of the executive committee of the SZSP main council.

From November 1981 to November 1985 he was editor-in-chief of the ITD
weekly and later the Sztandar Mlodych daily.  He then moved into
government in October 1985 as minister and head of the committee for
youth and physical culture under Prime Minister Zbigiew Messner, and
stayed there through to June 1990 under prime ministers Miczyslaw
Rakowski and Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  From October 1988 to September 1989
he chaired the cabinet's socio-political committee.

After the dissolution of the PZPR he became a member of its
successor, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD).  He became a member of
parliament and head of the SLD caucus in October 1991 and has been
head of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly since
November 1993.

However, despite all this high profile activity, the Walesa camp was
quite unable to come up with any dirt.  Moreover, the "the Reds are
coming" message was undermined both by Kwasniewski's consistent
campaign message that he was committed to maintaining the thrust of
the free-market reforms and the fact that the SLD/PSL (Polish Peasant
Party) government, also former communists, have not been making a bad
job of running the country.

This reduced the Walesa campaign, finally, to complaining about
Kwasniewski's educational qualifications, or lack of them.

Rather stupidly, Kwasniewski had put it about that he had a master's
degree from Gdansk university.  Diligent digging by the Walesa
campaign team proved that he had in fact failed to complete his
course with a masters' thesis and that no degree had been awarded.

But it was too little, too late.  In the run off election on November
19 and with a turnout of 68.23%, Kwasniewski won 9,704,439 votes, or
51.72% of the votes cast.  Lech Walesa came second with 9,058,176, or
48.28%.

Lech Walesa's reaction to his defeat was consistent with the manner
in which he had conducted his presidency - mean-minded and
vindictive.  This man was a hero.  It was Walesa who called the
strike in a Gdansk shipyard 15 years ago which spread nationwide,
created the Solidarity movement, and started the beginning of the end
of the communist dictatorship in Poland.  It was Walesa who proved
the greater man when martial law was invoked in 1981 to crush
Solidarity.  For his courage and foresight in helping to avoid
bloodshed he was rightly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1983, an
award he refused to accept in person while his colleagues remained in
prison.

Despite the failures of his term as president, that background meant
that Walesa could have departed with dignity and able to regain the
"father of the nation" status that was previously his.  Instead, he
mounted an immediate campaign to have the election result set aside
on the grounds that Kwasniewski had lied about his education
qualifications.  Realizing that this appeared a bit weak, they threw
in the spurious allegation of electoral fraud and claimed that
Kwasniewski had suppressed information about his family's shares in
the Poisa insurance company.

At the time of writing, the Supreme Court had received some 600,000
petitions that the presidential elections be annulled on the basis of
one or all of these grounds.  Given that the Walesa camp has yet to
produce any actual evidence of fraud. the pettiness of the
educational qualifications question, for which Kwasniewski had
already apologized, and the fact that Kwasniewski did produce a full
breakdown of his finances, it seems unlikely to us that the Supreme
Court will rule the election illegal.  In that case Aleksander
Kwasniewski should be Poland's next president.

That will give Poland a left-wing president as well as a left-wing
government.  Some Western commentators look upon such a development
with alarm.  We don't share it.  Quite simply, countries like Poland
now have no alternative but to follow the reformist path.  Even the
most backward-looking former communist knows that any retreat would
lead to the political, social and economic chaos that is Russia.
Moreover, all their economic plans, and therefore hope of progress,
are inextricably tied to Western political and financial institutions
such as the IMF, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  Quite simply, there is no way back.

Rather, we see Kwasniewski's success as positive.  With a like-minded
president, prime minister and government Poland has much better
prospects of achieving harmony in political decision-making than was
ever possible Lech Walesa's presidency.  The key early test of
Kwasniewski's ability to work with Prime Minister Oleksy will be the
way he handles the so-called presidential ministers.

The incumbents of these posts - Andrzej Milczanowski of internal
affairs, Wladyslaw Bartoszewski of foreign affairs, and Zbigniew
Okonski of national defense all tendered their resignations with
effect from December 20.

Religion in Politics
Lech Walesa's defeat in the presidential election was also a defeat
for the Catholic Church, which conducted an all-embracing campaign in
his favor.  Like Walesa, the Church has also been less than
magnanimous in defeat, with the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Jozef
Glemp, calling Kwasniewski a liar in all but name.  Referring to the
fuss over Kwasniewski's educational achievements, the Cardinal
declared that the one thing known about him was that he "publicly
bore false witness".

This was par for the course.  When he cast his own vote in the second
round, Cardinal Glemp said the election was a "choice between a
system of Christian values and a system of neo-pagan values".  After
the election he commented that a society which chose a presidential
candidate who did not represent Christian values was morally sick.
Other priests reportedly said that anyone who voted for Kwasniewski
was committing a sin.

When the electorate decided that "morally sick" or not, it was
plumping for a "system of neo-pagan values", the Church swung into
action behind the campaign to get the elections annulled.  Priests
berated their congregations and dished out protest forms for the
Supreme Court, printed by Lech Walesa's provincial headquarters in
Poznan.

In order to get the message across to those who did not manage to
make it to mass, the Church's own radio station, Radio Marya,
broadcast appeals to the faithful to send in demands to the Supreme
Court that the election be annulled on the basis of Kwasniewski's
"falsification" of personal details.  This was so blatant, that the
National Radio and Television Boradcasting Council was forced to
intervene on the grounds that the radio station was contravening the
terms of its franchise by involving itself in political protest.

Meanwhile, a new political party was registered on November 21.
Called the "Movement for Poland's Reconstruction" it comprises the
former election committee of Jan Olszewski, who gained 6.8% of the
vote in the first round of the presidential election.

Social Conditions
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) estimates that more than one
million Poles work unregistered in the gray, semi-illegal, economy.
GUS concludes from this that the true level of unemployment is
significantly lower than the official figures suggest.  Just under 7%
of the total number of people registered as employed also register a
second job.  However, GUS believes that the true percentage is much
greater than this and that more than two million people were employed
in the gray economy last year.

Men worked unregistered more often than women; urban dwellers did it
more often than the rural population.  It also emerged that one young
person in eleven was employed in the gray economy which employed not
only people with poor qualifications but specialists as well,
although the latter's work in the gray economy was not their main
job.

Rather surprisingly, the GUS study found that horticulture and
agriculture were the largest employers in the gray economy.  Work in
the service sector came second.  Households were the main employers
of gray economy workers, followed by private firms.

The situation on the labor market did improve last year, with the
number of people in work rising by 1.7% up in October 1995 compared
with October 1994, bringing the number of employed to 15,720,000.
However, this is 2,500,000 than in 1990.

The unemployment rate stood at 14.7%, down from 16.2% at the same
time in 1994.  This translates into some 2,600,000 people officially
registered as having no job.  However, if all the unemployed are
counted, including pensioners, the figure rises to 11,600,000, an
increase of 5,00,000 since 1990.  According to demographic forecasts,
the number of people able to work will increase by 680,000 by the end
of this century.

Salaries in the industrial sector grew and after three quarters of
1995, the wages in the economy were 1.6% higher than in
January-September 1994.  However, public sector wages fell 1.5%.  The
Central Statistical Office (CUP) estimates that after the fourth
quarter indexation of pensions, the purchasing power of the benefits
will have risen by 2.8% in the whole of 1995.

POLAND
ECONOMY

The GDP grew by around 6.5% last year, with industrial production
rising by 10%, construction and assembly by 11%, and agricultural
production by 7-9%.  On the downside, inflation was higher than
predicted, while high unemployment, especially among young people, a
continuing crisis in housing, and growing economic disproportion's
between households continued to hold down expectations.

Industrial output rose by 11% in the first 10 months of last year,
compared with corresponding period of 1994.  In the construction
sector, production was 15.5% higher.  However, the number of
completed flats was 20.7% lower than in January-October 1994.

The inflation rate for the month of October was 1.8%.  With hopes of
the monthly rate moderating to an average of 1.5% in the last two
months of the year, the projected annual rate for 1995 was 28% - well
above the 22.7% rate forecast in the 1995 state budget law.

Exports grew by 28.9% in September, compared with a growth of 37.6%
in the first eight months of the year.  Imports also rose rapidly,
however, and at the end of September the deficit in the balance of
payment of commodities amounted to US$930 million.

The state budget deficit stood at ZL6.02 billion in October,
equivalent 68.1% of the figure forecast for the whole year.  Revenues
of over ZL66 billion were collected in the first 10 months of the
year, while the expenditures over this period stood at ZL72.08
billion.

Privatization
The sale to the population of special share certificates in 15
National Investment Funds (NFI), controlling more than 500 state-run
companies, was ceremonially launched on November 22. Polish citizens
were eligible to buy the share certificates at a fee of ZL20 (some
US$8.09) and later exchange units made up of these certificates for
shares in each of the 15 NFI.

On November 27, it was reported that more than 250,000 people had
bought NFI share certificates in the first three days of their
distribution.

Also in November, the Polish Privatization Ministry said that a total
of 914 state enterprises were transformed into State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies in the period between July 1990 and October
1995.  This accounts for 26.8% of the 3,412 enterprises subject to
this process.  However, only around 150 of the State Treasury-owned
joint-stock companies have been privatized so far.  A total of 1,160
enterprises were wound down under the privatization process and the
liquidation of 1,338 enterprises, which were in poor financial
condition, has begun.

A new version of the privatization bill was due to be submitted to
parliament in the middle of January 1996.  According to privatization
minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, parliament would be able to speed up the
legislative process by suing the deputies' bill already submitted to
the parliamentary speaker.  However, the Constitutional Tribunal has
already ruled that some of the provisions of the deputies' bill
contravene the constitution.  These include the provision making the
privatization of strategic industries dependent on the consent of
parliament.

Another commitment made by the government before the presidential
election was that the privatization of the State Airline LOT would be
ready by the end of this year.  Under the privatization scheme being
prepared by a ministerial committee, the state treasury will retain a
51% stake in LOT and another 20% would be sold on "easy terms" to LOT
employees.

LOT's fleet currently comprises four Boeing 767, 10 Boeing 737 and
seven ATR-72 aircraft.  In 1994, the company carried 1,583,000
passengers, 14% more than in 1993.

Unemployment
In an effort to tackle the unemployment time bomb (see Social
Conditions above), the government approved a draft program for job
creation last November, which unlike the current program, focuses on
eliminating the sources of unemployment, rather than alleviating its
effects.  Its overall aim is to achieve an unemployment rate of 8% by
the year 2000.

Funding for the new program is put at ZL9,000 billion this year,
ZL3,000 billion more than last year.  The additional funds will come
from cutting expenditure on unemployment benefits, which at used up
about 88% of the Labor Fund in 1995.  It is expected unemployment
benefit this year will be linked to minimum pay, rather than to
average pay as has been the case up to now.  The actual level will be
around 88% of minimum pay.

The new program also proposes, for the first time, that unemployment
benefit will be withheld or reduced when an unemployed person refuses
the offer of a job for which he or she is qualified.  Under the
existing system, an unemployed person can refuse up to two job offers
without giving any reason.  From this year school leavers will
receive scholarships for active job seeking and training rather than
automatic benefits.

In order to help in job creation, state support will be given to set
up special economic zones with concessions for investors and
entrepreneurs.  Favorable terms will apply for people starting up new
businesses.  The budget will also help finance regional restructuring
programs and investment projects in areas with high structural
unemployment.

Mining Restructuring
In November last, the government promised there would no mass layoffs
as a result of its plan to restructure the coal mining industry.  The
plan provides for reducing employment by 90,000 miners in the years
1996 through to 2000.  However, miners were assured that 56,000 of
these jobs would disappear through the normal process of retirement,
while the remaining redundancies would be cushioned.

The five-year restructuring plan is designed to put the industry on a
sound economic footing by cutting costs and improving productivity.

Meanwhile, the government has stressed that lignite and hard coal
will remain Poland's main energy sources until the year 2010 despite
the planned increase in the share of gas in energy production.  At
present 43% of energy is produced from lignite, the cheapest source
of energy with prices of up to ZL25 (about US$10) per tonne.  Lignite
resources are estimated at 228 billion tonnes with an annual
extraction rate of 100 million tonnes.

POLAND
FINANCE

Deputy prime minister and finance minister, Grzegorz Kolodko,
prsented the budget bill to parliament on November 22.  This is the
third draft budget to take account of the government's "Strategy for
Poland" program.  The declared aim of the budget is to maintain a
high rate of economic growth, curb inflation, improve living
conditions, increase individual incomes and improve the efficiency of
public services.

Budget funds are increased in real terms, but are not sufficient to
cover all the needs.  Thus, certain areas are prioritized. - public
security, education , restructuring of the countryside, the reform of
the health service, housing construction and culture.

According to the draft budget, the deficit is not to exceed 2.8% of
GDP, while inflation is targeted to fall to 17%.

Japanese Guarantees
In November, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and
Industry announced that Japan has resumed granting guarantees for
exports and investments to Poland.  The decision was made because
Poland has started to fulfill the three conditions for restoring the
guarantees: regular repayment of interests on debts, maintaining good
relations with creditor countries and the International Monetary
Fund; and stabilizing its economic situation.

Japan suspended commercial guarantees for Poland in April 1991
because of the country's growing foreign debt.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
POLITICS

Prime Minister Meciar's vendetta against President Kovac continues
apace.  So far, however, and to the increasing irritation of the
premier, the president remains in place.  The problem for Meciar is
that he is running out of ammunition.  He has managed to get a
no-confidence vote in the president passed in parliament by virtue of
the simple majority held by his coalition.  However, this still falls
short of the majority required, as all the opposition parties support
Kovac's continuation in office. President Kovac can only be dismissed
by three-fifths of the votes in parliament, i.e. 90 out of the 150
seats.  The government coalition does not have that number.

Confounded in that direction, Meciar has also tried to bring Kovac
down by establishing a parliamentary commission to investigate his
role in bringing down his government in March 1994.  With the
commission packed with his own supporters, it could be counted on to
bring in a damaging enough critique of the president for his
impeachment to be sought.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruled in November that such
commissions are unconstitutional on the grounds that the 1989 law
under which commissions are empowered prevents them from starting a
criminal prosecution or obliging people to give evidence at public
hearings.

This is a major blow to the Meciar government, which has set up three
parliamentary commissions, the first, established on  November 3,
1994, the day after Meciar was returned to power, was to look into
President Kovac's role on the earlier dismissal of the Meciar
government; the second was to look into the election lists of the
opposition Democratic Union (DU), whose creation precipitated the
fall of that government, with the aim of excluding it from
parliament; the third, also designed to embarrass the opposition, was
to look at the sale of army pontoons to India; and the fourth, an
investigation into in the car crash in which Alexander Dubcek was
killed in 1992.

All will now have to be wound up.

There has also been the curious case of the kidnapping of the
president's son, Michal Kovac junior.  Although little is currently
known of the detail of this case, it is not beyond the realms of
possibility that this too was part of a plot to discredit Kovac
senior.

The bare bones are as follows: In 1994, Peter Krylov, a Slovak who
had become a German national and who headed a Slovak company called
Technopol was found guilty of fraudulently removing US$2.3 million
from it.  On August 31 last year, Michal Kovac junior was abducted
and taken to Vienna, Austria.  After his arrival, Krylov claimed that
Kovac junior was a partner to the fraud.  Although he made no mention
of Kovac during his trial in 1994, Krylov said that the fraud arose
when Kovac, representing his own company, called Sycko, presented
Technopol with a fraudulent trade deal.

Kovac junior, now released by his captors, but remaining safely in
Vienna, has refuted all the allegations and has claimed that he had
never met Krylov and never discussed any deal with him.  It then
transpired that one of the men involved in his kidnapping was an
agent of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS), known publicly only
by the name, Oskar F.  The man ultimately in charge of the SIS is, of
course, Prime Minister Meciar.  Despite the weight of evidence
against Oskar F., President Kovac pardoned him from all criminal
charges on November 29.  Was this in return for Oskar F. Disclosing
the full background to the kidnapping?  If so, some very interesting
information may be about to unfold.

With all these various avenues of bringing down the president
apparently blocked or stalled, Prime Minister Meciar is being forced
to consider the final arrow in his quiver - his long-standing threat
to call a referendum on Michal Kovac's fitness to be president.  But
this remains fraught with risk for the premier.  Despite all he has
done to denigrate the president, weaken his powers and diminish his
office - government formulated cut-backs in budget allocations to the
president's office have already forced the sacking of over 40
presidential staff - the people of Slovakia stubbornly continue to
give a higher approval rating to their president than to their
premier.  If Meciar were to call a referendum and lose, his position
would become near untenable.

Racial/Ethnic Tension
Meanwhile, the government has managed to create yet another
confrontation with the European Union and the USA, as well as with
Hungary and part of its own opposition, over its attitude to
Slovakia's Hungarian minority.  The specific point of issue was the
passing by parliament on November 15 of the long debated Language
Law.  A total of 108 of the 142 parliamentary deputies voted in favor
of the law.  All 17 of the deputies belonging to the Hungarian
Coalition voted against, while 17 deputies - all deputies of the
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), plus Lubomir Ftacnik of the
Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) and Viliam Vaskovic of the
Democratic Union - abstained.

At the same time, parliament notably failed to approve the
Slovak-Hungarian basic treaty, which is supposed to form the basis
for good relations and cooperation between the two states.

The Language Law stipulates that Slovak is the only state language in
the republic and orders all state employees to speak Slovak and that
all newspapers and periodicals must be published in the state
language.  Also, all public ceremonies, except weddings, must be
conducted exclusively in the Slovak language. That part of the law
stipulating these obligations came into force on January 1, 1996,
while the section of the law regarding fines and other sanctions for
failure to meet the obligations will become effective on January 1,
1997.

Slovakia's Hungarian minority, which has been campaigning against the
law throughout 1995, sees it as a direct attack on its status and
culture.  However, during the months of national debate on the issue,
the government did promise that the Language Law would be accompanied
by additional legislation guaranteeing support for minority languages
and determining their use in official contacts.  Significantly, this
accompanying legislation was not presented to parliament with the
basic Language Law.

Hungary withdrew its ambassador in protest and raised the matter at
the 47th plenary assembly of the permanent Council of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  On
November 16 the EU parliament passed a resolution condemning the
legislation and warned Slovakia that it must show greater respect for
human rights and democracy or EU aid may have to be suspended.  The
USA issued a note to similar effect.

One would have thought that having provoked earnest criticism both
inside and outside the country, the government would have taken a
conciliatory and assuring tone.  Not a bit of it.  Referring to the
EU resolution as a "demarche" of the kind used by Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union against its neighbors, Prime Minister Meciar said
that Slovakia would never succumb to such threats and that businesses
would be compensated for any losses should the EU's PHARE program to
Slovakia be canceled.

To add even more heat to the fire, SNS deputy Vitazoslav Moric said
that political parties specifically representing Hungarian interests
should be banned and that the Language Law should be used to
counteract the "disproportionate" number of Hungarian schools in the
south of the country.  When asked what would happen to the Hungarian
press from January 1 this year - when all publications are supposed
to be in Slovak - Moric said "there will be no Hungarian press".

Corruption in Government
Meanwhile, the opposition has gone onto the attack, accusing members
of the government of corrupt practices in the implementation of its
privatization program.  One of the first acts of the Meciar
government was to throw out the privatization program produced by its
predecessor and replace it with one of its own.  It then allegedly
packed the Privatization Ministry, the National Property Fund and the
Supreme Supervisory Bureau - the bodies responsible for the program -
with people belonging to or supporting the three coalition parties,
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the Association
of Slovak Workers (ZRS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS).

At the end of November, Mikulas Dzurinda, the deputy chairman of
opposition the Christian-Democratic Movement (KDH), accused ZRS
leader, Jan Luptak, of exercising undue influence on the
privatization process in order to enrich himself and his family, and
other government ministers and their families.  He also accused the
government of selling off state assets to family and friends at a
fraction of their real value.

Dzurinda claimed, for example, that the new private sector owners of
Slovnaft paid down only 1.56% of the company's shares nominal value,
2.35% for Duslo Sala (a chemical plant), 2.75% for the Vysne Ruzbachy
spa, and 0.06% in the privatization of the Zvolen Meat Processing
Plant.  The new owners, said Dzurinda, are now able to sell the
companies abroad and divide the profits on a 50:50 basis - one half
to partial sponsors and one half to their own pockets.

The same cry has been taken up by Peter Weiss, chairman of the
opposition Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), who accused the
government of creating a "privatization sleaze".  He said it was a
scandal that only nine men at the Natinal Property Fund (FNM) are
responsible for privatization decisions and that there is clear
evidence that state assets are being sold off at below market value.
Moreover, he added, privatization is benefiting literally only a few
hundred people.  As a result, a "clientist" political system is being
created in which economic and political power are being welded
together.

At the same time, the opposition parties have demanded an
investigation into whether the former SNS deputy chairman and present
director of Slovenska Poistovna (the Slovak Insurance Company), Peter
Sokol, also has a 25% share in the company which seeking to acquire
it under the privatization program. If so, he would make a clear
profit of Scr5 million (US$170,000) in dividends from the deal.  They
have also asked for an investigation into the high monthly income of
the SNS chairman, Jan Slota.

Questions have also been raised about ministers leaving government to
step straight in to top jobs in state companies on the privatization
list.  In November Marian Mojzis, the State Secretary in the Economy
Ministry, became director-general of the Petrimex joint-stock
company.  He was replaced as Secretary by his adviser, Pavol Hrmo.

Social Conditions
Prime Minister Meciar's peculiar method of governance is clearly
having an impact on the people's perceptions of democracy in action
as opposed to their counterparts in the Czech Republic, according to
a survey conducted in the middle of last year by the Sociological
Institute of the Czech Academy of Science and the Center of Empirical
Researches (STEM).

In answer to the question, "Were people like you better off before
1989?", (i.e. under communism) only 47% of Czechs answered yes,
compared with 73% of Slovaks.  In addition, of the respondents, 75%
of  Czechs believe that the freedom of the individual has increased
since 1989, while the figure for Slovaks was only 54%.  The Czechs
also tend to hold the view that at present they are given better
opportunities to upgrade their standard of living, while Slovaks tend
to believe that these opportunities were better before 1989.

The overall atmosphere in society was valued negatively by 60% of
Czechs and 70% of Slovaks.  More than 90% of those polled in both
countries have noticed deepening social inequalities.

An average Czech has an almost casual approach to unemployment,
believing that sooner or later he or she will be able to get a job
near home.  By contrast, unemployed Slovaks are willing to move to
find a job.  While the unemployment rate slipped under 3% in the
Czech Republic in September, the figure for Slovakia stood at around
13%.

Political Party Developments
At the end of November, Peter Weiss, the chairman of the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD), which he formed out of the old Communist
Party, announced that he would not seek re-election as chairman, but
would continue to aid the party in a private capacity.

The party only just managed to get into parliament at the last
election and Weiss's leadership has come under a good deal of
internal criticism.

Meanwhile, Jan Langos was elected chairman of the Democratic Party
(DS) at the party's Congress on November 18 with 167 of the 221
votes.  His opponent, the former chairman, Peter Osusky, received 46
votes.

New Borders
The negotiation of new border agreements with the country's
neighbors, necessitated by the separation from the Czech Republic on
January 1, 1993, are nearing completion.  The only borders to undergo
actual changes are with the Czech Republic and Hungary, and involve
452 and 209 hectares respectively.  The changes in the course of the
Slovak-Hungarian border are due to the beds of the Ipel, Slana and
Roznava rivers gradually changing their course since 1965.  The
Slovak-Hungarian agreement is apparently ready for approval.

Under the new agreements, Slovakia's borders measure 1,714.61
kilometers.  The longest section is the Hungarian border (678
kilometers), followed by Poland (547.1 kilometers), Austria (109 km),
and Ukraine (98.5 km)  The Slovak-Czech border is 285 km long, but
will be 33.21 kilometers less  after the new agreement is passed.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
ECONOMY

Industrial output in September 1995 was 13.2% higher than in
September 1994, according to data from the Slovak Statistical Office.
In the first nine months of the year, the total output of Slovakia's
manufacturing industry, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was
8.4% higher than in the same period of 1994 and amounted to Scr362.2
billion.

The construction industry's output in September 1995 was up by 1.7%
on September 1994.  In the first nine months of 1995 the construction
industry's output rose by about 3.9% on the same period of 1994 and
the industry's projects were worth about Scr36.3 billion.

Farming enterprises' turnover in September 1995, calculated at
current prices without corn for seed and seedlings, was 7.9% down on
the same period of 1994.  In the nine-month period, farmers earned
Scr21.6 billion, excluding corn for seed and seedlings, and their
sales were 3% up on the same period of 1994.  Although there was a
1.4% decline in crop production, this was offset by a 5.2% growth in
the sale of animal products.

Retail trade, calculated at inflation-adjusted prices, was 16.6%
higher in September 1995 than in September 1994.  In the first nine
months, retail sales amounted to Scr199.4 billion, a rise of 19.9% on
the same period of 1994.  The retail trade annual rise, calculated at
inflation-adjusted prices, amounted to 8.1%.

Private businesses accounted for 63.7% of the manufacturing industry
output and for 80.6% of the
construction industry output.

The draft budget for 1996 (see FINANCE section below) projects a GDP
growth this year of at least 5%, with inflation falling to 6-8%.

Unemployment
Unemployment remains a pressing concern.  The unemployment rate did
fall to 12.8% in October last, the first time it had been below 13%
since the end of 1994.  In the month there were 82,472 unemployed
people receiving state support in the month, 1,942 less than in
September.  Of the unemployed people 53.1% were women, 7.7% people
with limited ability to work and 18.3% school leavers.  There were
325,490 registered job seekers in the month.

Although the current unemployment rate compares favorably with the
majority of the other former Comecon countries in Eastern Europe, it
is embarrassingly high compared with the Czech Republic, the only
comparison that counts for most Slovaks.  In an attempt to ensure
that the rate continues to move downward through 1996, the government
is to introduce a new system of unemployment benefits this year.

The old system of a single benefit scheme for all registered
unemployed people has been replaced by a two-tier system to
distinguish between those who are not to blame for losing their jobs
and who want to work and those who do not want to work.  This will be
coupled with a change in social policy through the introduction of a
"poverty" level in addition to the existing "subsistence" level.  The
poverty level will be considerably lower than the subsistence level
and will be applied to those who refuse to accept a job.

Inward Investment
The total volume of foreign investments in Slovak companies had
reached Scr19.8 billion (US$660.8 million) by the end of September
1995, a 12.8% increase since the end of July.  Foreign capital was
invested in 8,469 companies, with the largest volumes going to
industry, trade, financing and insurance companies.

The most important investors, investing over Scr1 billion, were from
the following countries (ranked according to volume of investment):
Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, France and Great
Britain.  The situation in foreign investments during the third
quarter of 1995 was influenced by the establishment of three branches
of foreign banks in Bratislava, the Austrian Bank Austria (name as
received), the Czech Komercni Banka and the US Citibank, with
contributions of British capital.

Gas Pipeline
It was agreed in November that the new pipeline to carry gas from the
Yamal deposit in northern Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germany
will incorporate a branch line to Slovakia.  The line, which will run
for 233 kilometers from Poland will probably be built by a
Slovak-Russian joint venture.

The Russian gas company involved, GAO Gazprom, also showed interest
in extending the current transit gas pipeline from Slovakia via
Hungary and Slovenia to Italy.  Slovakia will buy 5.1 million tonnes
of Russian crude oil next year.  In addition, Russia has reportedly
agreed to supply Slovakia with natural gas from Turkmenistan through
its gas system.

Coal Industry Privatization
Prime Minister Meciar said in November that the coal mining and the
coal engineering industry in
Slovakia's most important coal region, Horne Ponitrie (the Upper
Nitra region), will be privatized.  He said that in line with
election promises, mine employees and Prievidza citizens would be
able to purchase the region's collieries for a nominal one Slovak
crown.

The mine employees and the citizens of Prievidza will receive state
privatization bonds which they will be able to exchange shares.  The
privatization of the region's engineering industry, due to be
implemented concurrently with the privatization of coal mining, will
be treated separately and with a different legal method.

The Horne Ponitrie region is suffering from an overall decline in
production due to the slow transformation and decline in the coal
mining industry.  As a result unemployment in the region has soared
and now stands at around 9,240.

State Railway
The state-owned Slovak Railways is expected to have incurred a loss
of around Scr3 billion last year from its passenger services.  The
government will only cover up to Scr1.73 billion of this loss due to
limited resources in the state budget.  Slovak Railways expect that a
similar situation will also arise this year when the costs of
operating passenger transport will be Scr5.051 billion, while sales
will only reach Scr1.63 billion.   However, the state is committed to
covering only Scr2.03 billion of the expected Scr3.42 billion loss,
according to the proposed budget for 1996.

Railway passengers in Slovakia now only pay 43% of the real cost of
transport.  The real cost per person per kilometer is Scr1.16, but
passengers pay only Scr0.50.

JANUARY 1996

SLOVAK REPUBLIC
FINANCE

Finance minister Sergej Kozlik has predicted that the budget deficit
for 1995 will be much lower than forecast.  In late November the
deficit stood at Scr7 billion, compared with a target figure of Scr27
billion for the year as a whole.  Kozlik said that the reason for the
lower budget deficit was the fact that only 86% of the planned
budgetary expenditure had been used and that 93% of the planned
revenues had been collected.

1996 Budget
The draft budget for 1996 approved by the government in November
projects a deficit of Scr27 billion, with revenues put at Scr162.4
billion and expenditures at Scr189.4 billion. that debt repayment
spending will be Scr19 billion this year, the fiscal position of the
state budget means a deficit of 1.5% of GDP.

The budget makes no provision for rent, fuel or energy price rises
this year as part of the government's policy of bearing down on
inflation.  The inflation rate has followed a downward trend of late,
falling from 9.8% year-on-year in August to 7.9% year-on-year in
October.

As part of the inflation strategy, parliament approved a new price
law in November, which gives the Finance Ministry and local
authorities at district and regional levels the right to regulate the
prices of goods and commodities.  The new law enables state officials
to regulate prices in cases of "economically justified" costs or
"adequate profits".

Critics claim that the law could lead to a situation where the state
would be in charge of price setting.  The opposition argued that the
law was only just within the bounds of the market economy system
because it empowered state officials to decide on the "adequacy" of
prices, costs and profits.

However, spending on the intelligence service (SIS) is to rise by 50%
to Scr760 million (US$29 million).  The money allotted to the
government will more than double, from Scr150 million in 1995 (US$5.8
million) to Scr414 million (Scr15.9 million).

On the other hand, the President's Office will again receive less,
Scr97 million (US$3.7 million) as against Scr121 million (US$4.65
million) in 1995.  All part of Prime Minister Meciar's strategy to
curtail and diminish the presidency by whatever means available.

Foreign Trade
A surplus of Scr3.5 billion was recorded on the balance of foreign
trade in the first 10 months of last year.  Exports were worth
Scr210.7 billion, an increase of Scr37.6 billion or 21.7% on the same
period of 1994.  Imports were worth Scr207.2 billion, an increase of
Scr35.8 billion or 20.9% on the same period of 1994.

The largest share of exports went to the Czech Republic (35.4%),
Germany (18.9%), Austria (5%), Italy (4.7%), Hungary (4.6%), Poland
(4.4%), the Russian Federation (3.6%), Ukraine (2.1%), France (2%)
and the Netherlands (1.7%).

Exports to the EU countries went up by Scr18.5 billion (30.5%) and
made up 37.6% of total exports.  Exports to the OECD countries were
up Scr18.5 billion (27.4%) compared with the same period last year
and constituted 40.9% of total exports.

Imports mainly came from the Czech Republic (28.1%), the Russian
Federation (16.8%), Germany (14.3%), Austria (5.2%), Italy (4.5%),
Poland (2.9%), the USA and France (each 2.3%), Hungary (2.2%), the
Netherlands (1.7%) and Ukraine (1.5%).

A total of 34.5% of Slovak imports came from EU countries, which is
Scr15.2 billion (27%) more than in the first 10 months of 1994.  The
share of imports from OECD countries stood at 40.9%, an increase of
Scr18 billion (26.9%) compared with the same period of 1994.

Reserves
The Slovak National Bank's currency reserves stood at nearly US$3
billion at the end of October, US$900 million of which had been
accumulated during the first half of 1995.

The hard currency reserves of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
amounted to US$3,045 million on November 20, an increase of US$1.3
billion compared to the reserves held on January 1, 1995.

The sum total of hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia
amounted to US$4.55 billion on November 20, of which all commercial
banks in Slovakia held US$1.55 billion.  According to the 1994 Annual
Report of the NBS, at the end of December 1994 the NBS's hard
currency reserves stood at US$1,745 million.  The sum total of the
hard currency reserves held by all banks in Slovakia amounted to
US$3,093 million, of which all commercial banks held US$1,348
million.

Banking sector
The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) announced last year that almost
half of all loans extended by Slovak banks will not be repaid in
their full nominal value.  The total volume of the loans extended by
Slovak banks by the end of August last year amounted to Scr276.2
billion.  About Scr130 billion of this sum or 47% are presumed to be
doubtful loans, which are unlikely to be repaid in full, while some
Scr86 billion of these loans are considered as bad or
"irrecoverable".

If these estimates are correct, the total volume of doubtful loans is
almost as big as the state budget revenues or nearly 30% of
Slovakia's annual GDP.  The three biggest Slovak banks, which jointly
hold about 70% of all loans, also hold 90% of doubtful and bad loans.
These are:  Vseobecna Uverova Banka (the General Credit Bank),
Slovenska Sporitelna (the Slovak Savings Bank), and Investicna a
Rozvojova Banka (the Investment and Development Bank).

According to an NBS analysis, the assets of the biggest Slovak banks
are Scr19 billion below the level required to cover their risks.  The
Finance Ministry believes that the current high interest margins and
the new income tax law, due to give a boost to the process of risk
assets creation, should help the banks accumulate more risk assets.

Although banking sector representatives accept this argument, they
say that other legislative steps will have to follow that would
address the companies' problems as well as the bad loans problem.

EBRD Credit
In November, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) and the Slovak commercial bank Istrobanka have signed an
agreement on the opening of a DM30 million credit line for
Istrobanka, making it Slovak commercial bank, after Tatra Banka and
Polnobanka, to be selected by EBRD as its partner for providing
investment loans.

The money drawn from this credit line will be used for private sector
projects.  Istrobanka's clients will have a chance of receiving a
credit ranging from DM0.5- 8 million per project on the estimated
repayment period between seven and eight years.

IRAN
POLITICS

Attention is now concentrated on the parliamentary (Majlis) elections
set for March 8, 1996.  This has already led to some concerted
criticism of the power of the clergy in politics and, in early
October, to student demonstrations in Tehran university.  Details of
the incident, or incidents, are patchy, but it appears that students
sympathetic to the Hezbollahi staged some sort of demonstration in a
lecture hall, which then got out of hand.

In any event, this election will be a critical one for President
Rafsanjani and his reformist government.  Parliamentary elections in
Iran are complicated by the fact that the country has had no
nationally organized political parties since 1987.  This gives rise
to a large number of candidates standing as independents - typically
some 1,500 candidates compete for the 270 parliamentary seats.  With
Islam being the most pervasive national organization, this system
tends to favor religious candidates with strong local support.

Without the discipline of party ideology or membership, such
candidates are likely to be far more responsive to clerical or
popular opinion than they are to the government.  As a result, the
government's parliamentary support can become extremely fragile.

And that is the problem now.  With the massive contraction in
economic growth and high inflation, Rafsanjani's popularity is on a
long downward track.  This was shown in the last presidential
election in 1993, when support for Rafsanjani fell sharply.  However,
Rafsanjani's government was still fairly safe as its supporters
formed the largest bloc in the Majlis after the April 1992
parliamentary election with around 110 seats.  With the remaining
seats split between the antipathetic religious and, for want of a
better description, left-of-center candidates, the government has
been able to get support for its legislation  by playing one group
off against the other.

This time around there appears to be a real risk that religious
candidates will make significant advances at the expense of those
candidates supporting the government.  This, perhaps, is the real
reason behind the recent attacks on "politicized" clerics and
President Rafsanjani's call in a radio and television interview in
November for the formation of political parties rather than the
current "interest" groups that contest elections.

Rafsanjani argued that "serious" nationally based political parties
are essential in a political system that employs an electoral system
and that if any single party obtained a majority in parliament it
should form the government.  The statement was generally welcomed,
though many have also pointed out that this is not the first time a
call for the formation of political parties has been made since the
Islamic Republic Party stopped functioning in 1987.

To the surprise of many, the death sentence imposed on Fazel Khodadad
for his part in the Ir1,230 billion embezzlement at Bank Saderat was
carried out on November 22.  In all 20 people were arrested on the
embezzlement charges in the summer, but it was thought that Khodadad
was too highly placed to suffer the punishment meted out by the
court.  Two others were sentenced to life imprisonment and six to
long-term jail terms and cash fines.

Tehran Oil Conference
The successful holding of the international oil and gas conference in
November was hailed by the government as the decisive indicator of
the failure of the US oil trade embargo. The aim of the conference
was to brief foreign companies interested in taking part in the 11
projects being opened to foreign investment in the current five year
plan period.

Representatives from 123 international oil companies and 20 Iranian
companies attended the conference.  The size of the foreign
attendance has been taken by the government as the strongest possible
indicator that non-US oil companies will tender for the projects on a
buy-back basis and that its planned development of its oil and gas
sector will not be pushed off track by the US embargo.

Of the 11 projects, five are offshore.  They comprise the development
of the South Pars gas field, a the injection of gas into the Dorud
oil field, the development of the Khaf gas reservoir in the Salman
field, the development of the new Belal oil field, and the
reconstruction of installations and enhancement of the Sorush oil
field.

The on shore projects comprise a gas condensate refinery in Bandar
Abbas, a project for the Shiraz refinery, the construction of a gas
condensate recovery system at Lavan island, the construction of gas
and liquefied natural gas plants in southern Iran, and a project for
the collection of oil field gases in the south.

Foreign Relations
Pakistan
Although an official visit to Tehran by Prime Minister Bhutto has
served to put a stamp on the increasingly close relations between
Pakistan and Iran, a potential source of discord is beginning to
appear.  It seems that the two countries are supporting opposing
sides in the conflict in Afghanistan.  Relations between Pakistan and
the government of Afghanistan are already under pressure following
Afghani government allegations that Prime Minister Bhutto's
government is supporting the Taleban forces ranged against it.  This
has been denied by Pakistan and was denied again by Prime Minister
Bhutto during her visit to Iran.

However, Iran has consistently supported the government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.  Moreover, shortly before Prime Minister
Bhutto's visit, the Taleban forces officially complained that Iran
was training Afghan government troops in Iran.  Iran has also been
accused of allowing Afghan government forces to operate from Iranian
territory to launch operations aimed at liberating the town of Herat.
This has been denied by Iran, but the fact that the sympathies of the
two new partners clearly lie with opposing factions could prove to be
a problem in the future.

Iraq
Iranian involvement in Iraqi Kurdistan is growing, to anger of the
Iraqi government and exasperation of the USA.  After the failure of
the peace conference between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions -
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) -  in Dublin, Iran hosted another meeting between the two in
Tehran in October, and achieved at least a partial agreement.

To make matters worse, reports surfaced in November that Iran had
armed and dispatched units of Iraqi Shi'is to the Kurdish-inhabited
areas of Iraq in order to launch attacks against the Baghdad
government with the backing of the Iraqi National Congress. The units
are reportedly from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade, and have
been deployed around Sulaymaniyah. (For further details see the Iraq
report in this issue.)

United Arab Emirates
Four day long talks between expert teams from Iran and the UAE in
Doha, UAE, over competing territorial claims ended in failure in
November.  The dispute between the two countries centers around the
Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands
(Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra).

The islands are claimed by Iran, particularly Abu Musa, which was
occupied by Britain when it was the colonial power in the region.
However, when Britain left the island in 1971 it did not hand it over
to Iran but to the UAE.  The meeting apparently broke down when the
two sides failed even to agree on its agenda - Iran wanted to discuss
the administration of Abu Musa, while the UAE wanted to press its
sovereignty claim.

Iran has invited the UAE to hold to next round of talks in Tehran.
Currently, the UAE is resisting this and no announcement has been
made as to when the next round of talks will be held.

Turkmenistan
Iran and Tukmenistan have agreed on a series of military cooperation
measures, including joint exercises, following the first visit to
Turkmenistan by an Iranian military delegation in November.
Agreement has also been reached on Iranian and Turkmen border guards
working together to prevent violations of the common border

Japan
Iran is concerned over US pressure on Japan not to make payment of
the second installment of a loan agreed in April 1991.  Under the
terms of the deal, Japan undertook to contribute N150 trillion in
loans for construction f the Karun-4 dam in Iran's southern province
of Khuzestan.  In May 1993, Japan made a first installment of N38.6
billion (US$400 million) on the project.  However, it has not yet
paid the remainder.

Pressure is now on Iran as it needs the remainder of the loan to be
paid now if it is to complete the project by the target date of 2000.
Iran believes that the USA is putting strong pressure on Japan not to
pay the second installment and to cut back its trade with Iran.

IRAN
FINANCE

President Rafsanjani presented the budget for the year March 21,
1996-March 20, 1997 on November 26.  This second annual budget in the
second five-year development plan (1995-1999) totals Ir138,133.4
billion, an increase of 43.8% on the 1995/96 budget.  However, with
inflation running at over 50%, the budget represents a cut back in
spending in real terms.

The government's general budget was put at Ir60,742.3 billion, a
30.9% increase on 1995/96.

The budget for state-owned companies, profit-making institutes
affiliated to the government and banks is forecast at Ir90,248.4
billion, up 41% on 1995/96.  Of this figure, Ir79,928.4 billion
belonged to state-owned companies, Ir1,935.7 billion to profit-making
institutions affiliated to the government, and Ir8,384.3 billion to
banks.

Total revenues are put at Ir54,369.3 billion, an increase of 28.5%.
Some 51.5% of the total comes from oil income, 19.6% from tax income,
and 28.9% from other revenue sources.

Of the total revenue for the government, 25.5% will come from taxes
on oil and gas, electricity, posts and telecommunications services,
29.2% from hard currency sales, 34% from income-expenditure items and
11.3% from other items.

The increase in tax incomes is mainly due to a rise in taxes levied
on non-governmental companies, on jobs and on imports, which will
accrue through the improvement in the country's economy and the
expansion of trade and manufacturing in the domestic economy.

Crude oil production capacity is targeted to reach 4,250,000 b/d, and
gas production by 110 million cu.m/day.  The capacity of Bandar Abbas
refinery is to be raised to 232,000 b/d.  The oil price has been set
at US$15.5/bbl in the budget to produce a total government revenue of
some US$15.5 billion.  However, as the current oil price is around
US$16/bbl, there is a likelihood that actual revenue will be above
the budget figure.

Current expenditure is put at Ir31,934.7 billion, up by 15%. Rises in
the salaries of civil servants, transfer payments and grants amount
to Ir10.950 billion and account for 20% of the government's total
general budget.

Current expenditures on defense, education and training, health care,
and social security have risen sharply.  Defense expenditure is
slated to increase by 30.7%, from this year, to Ir5,900 billion,
while spending on education and training is to rise by 41.7% to
Ir5,256 billion and spending on health care by 11.2% to Ir18,965
billion.  On the other hand, current expenditures for importing oil
products have been cut by 27.8% due to the success of consumption
reduction policies.

Development credits are to rise by 53% to Ir22,684 billion in the
next financial year.  This will bring the ratio of development
expenditures to the government's total general budget to 42% from
34.8% in the current budget.

A number of industrial projects are due to go on stream next year,
including eight food and pharmaceutical plants with 50,000 ton
capacity, chemical plants with a total capacity of 342,000 tons,
metallurgical plants with 20,000 tons capacity, a lamp manufacturing
plant, two automobile spare parts plants, and six non-metals plants
with an annual capacity of 4.7 million tons.

On infrastructure, 2,300 kilometers of roads and 800 kilometers of
railway will be brought into service, including the 165 kilometer
Mashhad-Sarakhs line designed to link the Iranian railway to the
Central Asian network.  Cargo transportation volume is expected to
reach 25.5 million tons compared with 23 million tons this year.
A total of 450,000 new telephone lines are to be installed to bring
the number of villages connected to the national telephone network to
2,220.  Mobile telephone usage is also expected to increase.

In the cooperatives sector, the government is to help set up 3,600
cooperatives with a membership of 319,600 to bring 850 projects into
operation, creating 45,460 new jobs with an investment of Ir3,356
billion, which in turn will enable the building of 70,000 residential
houses.

In the farming sector red meat production is forecast to rise to
685,000 tons, poultry to 660,000 tons, fish to 450,000 tons, milk to
4.7 million tons and total protein from livestock and fisheries to
7.17 million tons.

The budget for state companies, banks and profit-making institutions
affiliated to the government is put at Ir90,284 billion, accounting
for 65.3% of the total budget.

To cater for the needs of the poor, the budgets of organizations
responsible for supporting this group have been increased from
Ir1,243 billion to Ir1,656 billion.  With the rise in the budget set
aside to support the poor, some 1.3 million families consisting of
4.5 million people will come under the government's support.  Of the
funds allocated to elimination of deprivation, Ir76 billion will be
spent on implementing self-employment projects.

Credits allocated to provinces for the year will be Ir2,492.2
billion, 16.2% up.  This money will be spent on education, health
care and infrastructure needs in such as road building, supply of
electricity and drinking water, and production facilities for rural
areas.

Credits earmarked to the deprived regions are increased by 22% to
Ir600 billion. A total of 77% of the figure comes from the provincial
credits and the remaining 23% from the national budget.

Some Ir700 billion has been allocated to reconstruction projects and
compensation payments. Once this money is disbursed 85% of all
reconstruction projects will be completed.

On housing, the government is to provide 31 million sq.m of land for
building 93,000 residential units and will pay a part of the banking
charges on loans granted for buying houses as well as offering
banking subsidies to teachers.  The government will also boost
investment in housing through the formation of credit cooperatives
and housing investment companies.

IRAQ
POLITICS

The most intriguing feature of the national referendum on Saddam
Hussein' presidency on October 15 was not the 99.96% who voted in
favor, but the 0.04% who did not.  The regime says that 8,357,560
voted, of which 8,348,700 plumped for seven more years of Saddam
Hussein's leadership.  That means that 8,860 people either spoiled
their ballot papers or, heaven forfend, voted against.

When asked by a reporter who these dissenters might be an election
official ventured the opinion that they might be either mentally ill
or of criminal intent.  Well, mad or bad, they are certainly brave.
It is popularly said it only takes one brave man to make a
difference: Iraq seems to have at least over 8,000 of them.

Clearly buoyed up by the success of the referendum exercise,
President Hussein has announced that elections to the National
Assembly will be held early next year, possibly in February or March,
and carried out a limited reshuffle of his government on November 6.
Education Minister Hikmat Abdullah al-Bazzaz was made adviser at the
presidency and replaced as education minister by Abd al-Jabbar Tawfiq
Muhammad. Irrigation Minister Nizar Mum'ah was replaced by Housing
and Reconstruction Minister, Mahmud Dhiyab al-Ahmad, and Abd al-Ilah
Hamid Muhammad Salih was appointed minister of agriculture.

Finally, just to confirm that the people's love of President Hussein
is diminished only in so far as they also idolize his son, Uday
Saddam Hussein was unanimously reconfirmed as president of the
executive council of the National Union of Iraqi Students on November
29 and given the powers of the Union's general assembly.

In an "Alice in Wonderland" message to senior state officials on
November 5, President Hussein said that all people were equal before
the law, whether or not they were members of the Ba'th party and that
those who abused their positions to gain favors for their own or
their families' benefit were unfit to hold positions of
responsibility.

It would appear that the message was prompted by the fact that under
the UN sanctions corruption is getting out of control - out of the
control of the Hussein family that is.  In fact, corruption,
particularly in diverting humanitarian aid, had become so blatant
that the government was forced to cut down on the number of fingers
in the till.

The problem was that an investigation a few months ago not only
unearthed evidence of the activities of one particular group of
officials, but also, inadvertently, implicated two high-ranking
officials Major-General Najm al-din al-Naqshabandi, the former senior
undersecretary at the Ministry of Interior, and Major-General Hatim
Ali Khalaf, another former senior Interior Ministry official, as well
as a number of lesser mortals.

The problem for the regime in this is that the two generals are both
closely associated with it, particularly with President Saddam's son,
Uday.  Given that the group had set up a network of foreign agents to
help them launder the moneys gained from diverting funds, intended
for humanitarian purposes, from various international agencies, it
was presumably feared that if they were made to suffer in any way,
the foreign agents working for the two men might release information
that would not only implicate close members of the ruling family, but
also impede their continued personal access to such funds.

Against this background it came as no real surprise that the case
against the two generals never came to court.  In late November the
National Assembly, in a special vote, acquitted both of all charges.
Their less well-placed confederates, however, have all been sent to
trial on charges of illegal acquisition of land, cars and funds.
They are Major-General Hashim Muhammad Faraj, Major-General Wa'd
Mahmud Sulayman and Dr Majid Khurshid.

But the referendum, the promise of parliamentary elections and
fulminations against corruption change nothing.  The UN sanctions
remain in place and the regime is only able to hang on to power
through the its ruthless imposition of a police state and the
constant weeding out of anyone though to present even the slightest
risk.  This combination of privation due to sanctions and fear of
falling suspect produces a continuing stream of defections from the
army to the Kurdish zone in the north.

A group of high-ranking officers reportedly defected to northern Iraq
shortly before the presidential referendum.  It included one
brigadier-general, two colonels and a major.  One of the defectors is
Colonel Yusuf Khalaf Khaffaji, the commander of the Second Battalion
of Brigade 116.

Iraqi Kurdistan
The three northern provinces of Sulaymaniya, Arbil and Dohuk, which
form Iraqi Kurdistan and have been under UN protection in the form of
a no-fly zone since the 1991 Gulf war, continues to be riven by
feuding between the Kurds themselves.  However, just as the two main
Iraqi Kurdish groups - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) - are inching towards settling their
differences, heavy fighting has broken out between the KDP and the
militant Turkish Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

KDP versus PUK
The KDP, which is led Mas'ud Barzani, occupies the western part of
Kurdistan and leans towards Turkey, while the PUK, which is led by
Jalal Talabani and occupies the southern part of the territory comes
under the influence of Iran.  The KDP is headquartered in the
hill-top town of Salahuddin, while the PUK has occupied the "capital"
of Kurdistan, Arbil.

The two groups have been fighting each other since 1994 when their
innate rivalry became uncontainable.  Its effect has been to destroy
the dream that the internationally observed elections in the region
in 1992 would lead to the establishment of a parliamentary democracy
in the region.  Instead it has only served to exacerbate the tribal,
linguistic and regional differences that Saddam Hussein exploited to
such effect in his efforts to break the back of Kurdish resistance.
Indeed, the KDP's West Kurdistan and the PUK's South Kurdistan have
virtually the same boundaries now as the old Kurdish principalities.

The fighting reached a peak in July, just before the two sides
attended US-sponsored peace talks in Dublin, when each launched
massive tit-for-tat attacks on the other's headquarters.  Hundreds
died for absolutely no gain.
However, the talks in Dublin, Ireland in August and September broke
down.  This failure opened the door for Iranian mediation, which led
to the holding of peace talks in Tehran between October 5-9.

To the USA's exasperation, these talks did actually produce a partial
agreement.  Most notably the PUK and KDP agreed to a cease-fire and,
in principle, set May 4, 1996 as the date for new elections.  Both
sides also agreed to accept the results of the election
unconditionally.

However, Iranian involvement went much further than this.   First,
the cease-fire is to be monitored by the Iranian controlled Supreme
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI).  Second, it was
also agreed Iraqi Shi'is located in Iran should participate in
Kurdish operations against Saddam Hussein's forces.  To this end,
Iran dispatched armed units of Iraqi Shi'is to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November.  According to an announcement from the Iraqi National
Congress, the units fare from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade,
and have been deployed around Sulaymaniyah.

The hand of Iran is also seen in the car bombing of the offices of
the main Iranian opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq, in central
Baghdad on November 27.  The explosion damaged buildings and shops in
the area but caused no casualties.  The organization blamed the
Iranian embassy in Baghdad of being responsible for the explosion,
the 36th to target the center since 1993.

All this is anathema to the USA, which desperately wants to keep Iran
out of an increasingly fractious situation.  In an attempt to regain
the initiative it dispatched a delegation to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November under the leadership of Robert Deutsch, head of the northern
Persian Gulf desk at the US State Department.  Deutsch held separate
talks with both Barzani and Talabani, but it is not clear that any
concrete progress, over and above that already made in Tehran, was
achieved.

However, there are intimations that Deutsch found a more sympathetic
reception from Talabani than from Barzani.  If true, this could
complicate matters further as Talabani's PUK depends heavily on Iran,
while the KDP, at least for the moment, is more closely allied to the
West, in the form of Turkey, due to its ongoing battles with the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).  The difficulty for US mediation
efforts is that it is committed to maintaining the territorial
integrity of Iraq, while most Kurds, in both the KDP and PUK, want to
establish Iraqi Kurdistan as an independent sovereign state.

KDP versus PKK
To add to these troubles a virtual war has now sprung up between the
PKK and the KDP on the Iraqi Kurdistan side of the Iraqi-Turkish
border.  Conflict between the two organizations flared up after
Turkey's second cross-border assault on PKK positions in July.  The
PKK believes that the Turkish army received at least tacit support
from the KDP, which relies on Turkish government goodwill to for
maintaining its cross-border supplies.

When the Turkish troops withdrew, the PKK launched a series of
attacks on KDP positions.  The KDP counter-attacked in force in
September.  In the initial assaults it claimed to have killed or
injured more than 1,000 PKK members out of a force of 2,500 in one
area.

The KDP kept up its attacks on the PKK through October and November.
It its reports are to be believed the PKK has suffered heavy damage,
both in men and materiel.  Turkey has officially offered its
assistance to the KDP in its fight with the PKK.  The KDP maintains
that it has not accepted such support.  Whether or not this is true,
relations between the KDP and the Turkish government are, to say the
least, cordial.  The same cannot be said of the PUK which has
steadfastly refused to become what it calls a Turkish gendarmerie to
fight the PKK.

The leader of the PKK, Anbdullah Ocalan, who is based in Syria and
Jordan called for a cease-fire in early November, but when the KDP
called on his to surrender the fighting continued.

Jordan
Although political relations may have been strained by the defection
of Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother in August, it appears King
Hussein is not prepared to take risk with his economy by downgrading
trade links with Iraq, particularly with regard to oil.  On September
11, representatives of the two countries signed a memorandum of
understanding on oil issues in Baghdad, which will ensure that trade
relations between Jordan and Iraq will remain as tight as ever.

The memorandum not only contains an agreement to establish an
Iraqi-Jordanian company for oil studies and development, but
additional agreements to build a Jordanian-Iraqi refinery in Aqaba
and to construct an Iraqi pipeline to the Zarqa refinery in Jordan.

The Aqaba refinery is to have an initial capacity of 140,000 barrels
per day (b/d) with the option to increase this to 250,000 refined
b/d.  The projected capacity of the 600-km pipeline is put at an
initial 100,000 b/d, with the option to increase to 350,000 b/d in
the second stage.  The objective of the pipeline is to replace the
current system of road tanker transportation.  Currently the shipment
of Iraqi oil from Baghdad to the port of Aqaba employs 1,500 tanker
trucks.

In addition to these oil sector projects, discussions are also
underway on boosting cooperation in electricity generation and
distribution and in industrial cooperation in such sectors as
pharmaceuticals, canning and packaging, and engineering in general.

IRAQ
ECONOMY

The UN decision to maintain sanctions against Iraq despite the wealth
of new information on its various programs for "weapons of mass
destruction" handed over after the defection of the Kamel brothers
and the referendum of Saddam Hussein's presidency in October, is
extremely bad news for the people of Iran.

The impoverishment of the country already underway as a result of the
eight-year war with Iran, has accelerated under the UN sanctions.
While the GDP per head has plummeted, inflation has soared.  A kebab
which cost Id2 in 1990 now costs Id800.

According to the UN's World Food program in Baghdad, four million
people in the country are now short of food, while the rate of child
malnutrition in central and southern Iraq is now higher than in
Sudan.  Infant mortality has reportedly increased by more than 25% a
year.

However, with no progress in sight on Iraq being able to meet the
conditions for lifting the sanctions the UN aid agencies are finding
it increasingly difficult to get the donor countries to keep coughing
up the funds to maintain the population in its present parlous state.
In October the UN launched an appeal for US$183.3 million t fund
humanitarian programs in the country.  Although the sum asked for is
lower than previous requests the total has still not been met and
only 30% of the UN's funding requests have been raised since 1991.
The USA gives no aid to Iraq as a whole, but channels all that it
does give exclusively to the Kurdish controlled north.

So far Saddam Hussein has resisted taking the opt-out of UN
resolution 986 of April of this year, which allows Iraq to sell US$2
billion worth of oil over six months exclusively for humanitarian
purposes.  The regime has refused to take up the option on the
grounds that the close monitoring involved is an affront to its
sovereignty.  There must, however, be a question as to how much
longer the resistance can be maintained.

ON the other hand, if Iraq does decide to take advantage of
Resolution 986 it could cause sever problems for other oil producers,
particularly neighboring Gulf countries which are counting on the
recent firming of international oil prices to get their economies
back in shape.  At their recent meeting OPEC members decided to
maintain the current output limits in order to maintain prices at
their current level.

However, the input of Iraqi oil in the market could upset the
delicate price stability that has been achieved and drive prices
down.  As the Resolution is concerned with revenue rather than
quantity, any fall in prices would force Iraq to increase sales in
order to reach the target figure of US$1 billion every three months.
The increased output would have a further knock-on effect on prices
and could produce a downward price spiral.  While that would be good
news for the consumer countries - those most concerned with
maintaining the sanctions - it could have a disastrous effect on the
other oil producing countries in the region.

Meanwhile, the government is trying to make up for a shortage of
household gas in the coming winter.  In the first and second quarters
of 1995 production of domestic gas was around 3,400 tonnes a day.
The aim is to raise this to 4,600 tons a day in the final quarter of
the year.

But production is only part of the problem.  The gas has to be
transported to the gas bottle filling stations in the towns.  As a
result of the sanctions - with spare parts like tires and batteries
in short supply, transportation costs have soared.

ISRAEL
POLITICS

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labor Party prime minister
only since 1992, was shot on the evening of November 4 while
attending a peace rally in Tel Aviv.  He died a short while later in
hospital.  His murderer was an Israeli Jew, Yigal Amir, a 27-year old
law student at Bar Ilan University and a member of Eyal, a militant
nationalist/religious group opposed to the peace process.

The murder of their prime minister by another Jew was not only a
physical blow against the governance of the state, but also a massive
psychological blow against the people at large.  In this single act,
Yigal Amir forced the Israeli people to admit that they too have been
as subverted by the struggle to retain the occupied territories as
have the Palestinian people in their effort to retrieve them.

This subversion probably began with the disastrous invasion of
Lebanon in June 1982, was compounded by the massive increase in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the same Likud government,
and reached its final expression in the massacre of Palestinians at
prayer in the mosque of the Cave of the Patriarchs by an American
immigrant settler, Baruch Goldstein, in February 1994.

What was palpably obvious, but never before admitted, was that the
militant Israeli groups that sprung up among the West Bank settlers
and their supporters in Israel proper was that they had the backing,
direct and indirect, of the Israeli government.  In confrontations
between the settlers and their Palestinian neighbors, the Israeli
security forces and government could always be counted on to be
partisan.

After the Cave of the Patriarchs atrocity, the organization to which
Goldstein belonged, Kakh, was declared illegal.  However, its members
were then absorbed by two other groups Eyal, led by Avishay Raviv,
and Kahana Hay, led by Binyamin Kahana.  The connection between these
groups and Kakh is underlined by the fact that the man responsible
for securing funds for Kakh, Herbert Sunshein, is also responsible
for securing funds for the other two groups.  And yet, the
authorities made no moves against either Eyal or Kahana Hay.  On the
contrary, it appears to have been deeply involved in both.

It now appears that members of the Israeli internal intelligence
service Shabak (formerly Shin Bet) were deeply involved in Eyal and
were aware on a day-to-day basis of its activities, including alleged
fatal attacks on Palestinian civilians.  This could be seen as proper
infiltration of a militant group by the authorities.  But if it was
merely infiltration in order to secure intelligence, why did it fail
to secure any information that could be used against the
organization's claimed attacks on Palestinians, let alone the murder
of Rabin?  One conclusion must be that the security forces were
supporting and encouraging Eyal's anti-Palestinian activities.

It never seems to have occurred to the Israeli people at large, and
particularly to the main political parties and the security services,
that they were breeding vipers in their breast, vipers that would one
day turn and bite their mentors. Hence the shock when a member of one
of those groups did exactly that by assassinating Rabin.

Thus it was that while security around Rabin was extra-high during
the peace rally, his bodyguards were looking only for Arab assassins,
particularly after the murder by the Israeli secret services of the
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki outside his hotel in Malta, only a
few days previously.

It also appears that the mass militarization of the people worked
against society in that Amir put into practice the skills gained
during his compulsory military service.  It has been reported that
Amir was employed by Shabak in 1992 and that he used the techniques
he learnt then to carry out the assassination.

The response of Eyal's fund-raiser, Sunshein, to Rabin's murder was
to say his death "proves that God is in the world...On November 4
when Rabin was shot, at the same time, on the Western calendar, Meir
Kahana was assassinated."

The New Government
The murder of Rabin threw the right-wing Likud into disarray.  On the
death of the prime minister the deputy prime minister, foreign
minister Shimon Peres automatically became caretaker.  If there is
one man the Likud leadership views with even greater distaste than it
viewed Yitzhak Rabin, that man is Shimon Peres, regarded by many on
the right in Israeli politics as the real architect of the peace plan
and therefore the arch traitor to the nation.

But with Rabin slaughtered, as Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu put
it, by another Jew, the party could not in conscience oppose Peres'
forming a new government as Israel's next prime minister.  Again in
the words of Netanyahu, "political murder must not disrupt the
continuity of government in a democratic republic".   As a result,
Likud abstained in the parliamentary vote on the new government
despite having "no confidence in the path of the new government, just
as we had no confidence in its predecessor's path".

Although some parties like the Moledet insisted that they would still
vote against him, Likud's abstention from the upcoming parliamentary
vote removed the only real obstacle to Peres forming a new government
under his leadership.

The assassination brought a closing of ranks in the Labor Party, with
two defectors - Shmuel Avital and Amir Peretz of the New Life
Movement - returning to the fold.  However, Peres wanted more than
that.

Immediately on assuming the role of caretaker, Peres attempted to
broaden the coalition he had inherited from Rabin through the
inclusion of one or more of the religious parties such as the
National Religious Party (NRP), United Torah Jewry, Tzomet and the
Torah Observing Sephardim (Shas).  To this end he intimated he would
accept some of their demands on religious issues.

This upset his existing coalition partner, the secular Meretz party,
which threatened to leave the government if the NRP was brought in.
This forced Peres to change tack and seek instead to secure the
support of the religious parties in parliament, without including
them in the coalition, by agreeing a "document of understanding" with
them.  However, he insisted that while Meretz would still be in the
coalition it would have no right of veto over negotiations with other
parties.

Some of these parties would appear to make unlikely bedfellows.  Only
a few days after Rabin's murder, the Tzomet chairman and member of
parliament (MP), Refael Eytan, quoted to high school students Article
29 of the Penal Code, which he claimed stipulated that anyone who
hands over lands belonging to the state risks the death penalty.
The clear inference was that Rabin had committed such a crime.

The same article is used by the militant groups to justify their
actions.  In fact, the article refers only to acts of treason, such
as espionage, as determined by a court of law.  Moreover, it cannot
be applied to occupied territories as they are just that, occupied
territories and not legally part of the sovereign state of Israel.

In any event, Peres still had to retreat further to secure the
continued support of Meretz.  On November 21, Labor agreed with
Meretz that all new religious laws would require an a priori
agreement by all members of the coalition.  In other words, Meretz
has got its veto.

With that matter settled the new government was formed on November 22
as follows:

Shimon Peres - prime minister and defense minister (Labor)
Shulamit Aloni - minister of communications, science and the arts
(Meretz)
Yosi Beilin - minister in the prime minister's office (Labor)
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer - construction and housing minister (Labor)
Uzi Baram - minister of tourism (Labor)
Ehud Baraq - foreign minister (Labor)
Mikha Harish - industry and trade minister (Labor)
David Libai - justice minister (Labor)
Ora Namir - labor and welfare minister (Labor)
Efrayim Sne - health minister (Labor)
Rabbi Yehuda Amital - minister without portfolio (Independent/Meimad)
Yair Tzaban - immigrant absorption minister (Meretz)
Ya'aqov Tzur - agriculture and rural development minister (Labor)
Yisrael Qeysar - transport minister (Labor)
Anon Rubinstein - education, culture and sports minister (Meretz)
Haim Ramon - interior minister (Labor)
Gonen Segev - energy and infrastructure minister (Yiud)
Avraham Shohat - finance minister (Labor)
Moshe Shahal - minister of internal security (Labor)
Shimon Shetrit - minister of religious affairs (Labor)
Yosi Sarid - environment minister (Meretz)

The first major surprise in the line-up was Peres' decision to take
on the defense portfolio, appointing Ori Or as his deputy.  The
second was his shake-up of the foreign ministry.  As Peres's
elevation to the premiership had left the foreign portfolio vacant,
it was natural enough for it to be filled, as it was by Ehud Baraq,
the former chief of staff.  However, Peres went much further by
appointing the former deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, to his
own office and transferring responsibility for negotiations with
Syria from Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington, to
the director-general of the Foreign Ministry Uri Savir, who is
already responsible for negotiations with the Palestinians.

The third surprise was the creation of a new Ministry of Internal
Security, under the former Police Affairs minister, Moshe Shahal,
made up of three commands - the police, the prisons service and the
Home Front Command.  The creation of this ministry now leaves the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) (i.e. the military services) on
concentrating its efforts on external threats to state security.

The effect of these three measures is to massively increase the
powers of the prime minister's office in three critical areas -
defense, the peace negotiations and internal security.

There is little doubt that Rabin's assassination has been a setback
for the right, particularly for the main party opposing the peace
plan - Likud.  Nevertheless, the forces ranged against any further
moves remain large and, if the various splits are ignored, there is
still a possible majority against the peace process.

Thankfully, however, the right continues to fissure.  Yet another new
hard-line right-wing party was officially registered on November 14.
Named the Yamin Yisrael (Israel's Right) it plans to contest the next
general election.  Appeals were lodged against its registration on
the basis that it is a racist party representing illegal positions,
but these were rejected by the party registrar.

Yamin Yisrael was established by MP Shaul Gutman, who split from
Moledet, and Miryam Lapid from Qiryat Arba, the settlement that
produced Baruch Goldstein.  It advocates the expulsion of Arabs and
insists that any partition of Eretz Yisrael (i.e. Israel plus the
West Bank, or Judea and Samaria) be prohibited by law.  It also calls
for the building of a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount.  The number
two in the party is Rahamin Kohen, a former Kakh movement executive.

Peace Process
The Oslo B agreement, singed by prime Minister Rabin and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat in Taba on September 28, was approved by the Israeli
parliament on October 6 by 61 votes to 59, with all 120 members of
parliament attending.  The Labor members Qahalani and Zismann voted
against.  It was the third agreement concluded between Israel and the
Palestinians in the occupied territories, the first being the
Declaration of Principles singed on September 13, 1993 in Washington,
and the second, the so-called Cairo Agreement signed on May 4, 1994.

Overall, the agreement covers the withdrawal of Israeli control from
further areas of the occupied West Bank and its replacement by
Palestinian control, and the holding of elections in the Palestinian
areas in January 1996.  Once that is achieved further talks will be
held to secure another agreement on the vacation by Israel of further
areas.

However, such further withdrawal is to be severely limited.  In
presenting the Taba agreement to parliament Rabin insisted Israel
will not return to the 1967 borders.  Instead, the security border
for the state of Israel will be situated in Jordan Rift Valley "along
the broadest possible interpretation of that term".  As a result, the
Etyzyon Bloc, Efrat, Betar and other settlements, mostly situated
east of the pre-Six-Day-War Green line will become an integral part
of the state of Israel.  In addition, Israel intends to keep the
whole of Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev, as the
undivided capital of the state of Israel.

The aim of all this, said Rabin, is to create an internationally
recognized sovereign state of Israel and a Palestinian "entity",
which will "manage the lives of the Palestinians under its
jurisdiction", will be "less than a state".

To say that this is contentious hardly addresses the issues raised.
The Palestinians have conceded much, i.e. their country, with the aim
of achieving their own state with Jerusalem as its capital. However,
here is the Israeli government stating categorically that neither of
those aims will never be achieved.  Prime Minister Peres has repeated
all of Prime Minister's Rabin's statement.

If that is Israel's stance, what will there be to discuss on the
fourth round?  There certainly will be no point in the Palestinians
attempting to negotiate on the issues.  In his first public
appearance as foreign minister on November 23, Ehud Baraq told Labor
party members that Israel would secure all of these demands "because
we are stronger".

This seems to us to be a recipe for disaster ahead and a guarantee
that terrorism will continue.

Meanwhile, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the additional areas
outlined in the Taba agreement have proceeded to plan.  Under this,
Israel was due to vacate the Jenin area during the period October 25
through November 19, the Tulkarm region by December 10, Nablus and
Qalqilyah by December 17, Bethlehem by December 20 and Ramallah on
December 31.  Withdrawal from Hebron is to be completed in March.

The Palestine National Authority (PNA) took control of Jenin on
November 13, taking authority over transport, communications and
meteorological responsibilities.  The process of vacating Nablus and
Tulkarm began at around the same time and the vacation of Bethlehem
and Hebron on November 15.  On November 28, 15 Palestinian officers
arrived in the city of Qalqilyah to coordinate the takeover of the
city by the PNA on December 18-26.

It has not been an entirely peaceful affair, however.  There were
violent clashes in Nablus between youths and the Israeli occupation
forces at the end of November. Youths blocked the streets with
barricades and burning tires and pelted Israeli patrols with stones.
Soldiers responded by firing shots and rubber bullets and throwing
percussion grenades.  A total of 23 people were injured.  After calm
was restored two Israeli Border Police were abducted in Jenin.  In
addition, the Israeli security forces killed a wanted Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) member south of Hebron on November 28.  He was
Muhammad Nasir Musalimah.  The house in which he was hiding was first
surrounded and then shelled with antitank rockets.  The house, with
the body of Musalimah still inside, was then bulldozed to the ground.
In reiterating Prime Minister Rabin's minimum territorial demands,
Prime Minister Peres said that the negotiations about the permanent
arrangement, due to last three years, will start in May 1996, and
said that he did not believe that anything significant pertaining to
the permanent arrangement would be decided before the parliamentary
elections in October next year.

Elections in the Palestinian areas are due to be held on January 20.
The election date was set by the Palestinian National Authority on
November 4 - the day Rabin was murdered.  Registration of voters
started on November 12.  There will be 66 European observers..

PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS
In September, the PNA reached an agreement with the World Bank
whereby international aid would henceforth be transferred directly to
the PNA, and not to the Palestinian Economic Committee on Development
and Reconstruction (PECDAR).  The PLO set up PECDAR, headed by Abu
Ala (Ahmad Quray), as the official address for international aid to
the PNA soon after signing the Oslo accord.

The PNA's various offices competed to take over responsibility for
the aid funds, including Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Planning and
International Cooperation Ministry, and to Abu Ala, who is also the
head of the Ministry of Economy.  However, it was agreed that the
bulk of the funds will go to the Finance Ministry headed by Muhammad
al-Nashashibi.

This is not only a blow to Sha'th and Abu Ala, but, as Nashashibi is
very close to Yasser Arafat, but also ensures that Arafat will be
able to control the distribution of the funds.  This will provide
enormous political benefits and will enhance his powers of patronage
even further.

Unemployment
Israel has imposed further restrictions on Palestinian workers in
Israel despite reopening the border on October 17.  On the eve of the
closure, some 35,000 Palestinians were employed in Israel.  However,
on lifting the closure Israel allowed entry to only 26,600, making
another 8,400 unemployed.

As of the opening only men of 35 years and older are allowed into
Israel from Gaza.  Before the closure, the minimum age was 30.  The
minimum age for Palestinian workers from the West Bank was raised
from 28 to 30.  In both cases, only married men are allowed to work
in Israel.

The civilian work force in the West Bank stands at 250,000 of whom
190,000 are employed in the region.  According to Civil
Administration data, the unemployment rate stands at 10%, some 25,000
people.  Some 60,000 Palestinians are employed in the self-rule area,
while some 14,000 work in Israel and the Eretz area.  The PNA claims
that the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is almost 50% of the
work force.

Dr. Fu'ad Bsisu, governor of the PNA fiscal authority, has warned
that unemployment might reach 32% in the West Bank and Gaza by the
beginning of this year.  He said that after 28 years of occupation
the restructuring of the Palestinian economy requires a strong
banking sector.

Finance & Aid
In this respect, a banking study prepared by the Palestinian fiscal
authority has reported that total deposits in the banks operating in
Palestine reached US$975 million at the end of May 1995, reflecting a
US$387 million, 65%, increase on the end of December 1994.  Total
client deposits in the PNA areas reached US$538 million at the end of
May, reflecting a US$286 million increase, or 48%.  In the West Bank,
total deposits up to the end of May reached US$437 million, an
increase of 30% on the end of December 1994.

According to the study, Gaza and Jericho are the major contributors
to bank deposits in Palestine, contributing 55%.  Judging by the
demographic structure, Gaza inhabitants represent 38% of the
population and account for 25% of the GNP. The study notes that
Gaza's share of commercial bank deposits is 55% of the total deposits
in Palestine.  This indicates relative political and economic
stability in the PNA areas.

Foreign Aid
A European Union delegation, headed by Spanish Foreign Minister
Javier Solana, now the new head of NATO, signed an agreement for the
provision of US$300 million in soft loans to the PNA on October 27.
The sum is part of the 1993 grant of US$600 million offered by the EU
in 1993.  The money will be used to set up large-scale water,
electricity and commercial projects.

In November, the PNA's donor group recommended offering US$75 million
to cover the deficit in the Palestinian budget and US$600 million to
finance investment and social projects.  The sums were due to be
approved during the donor countries' ministerial meeting in Paris on
December 9.

Israeli Settlement Expansion
Also in October the Peace Now settlement monitoring team claimed that
the construction of 1,400 new housing units had started in the Jewish
settlements of the West Bank since the start of this year.  Peace Now
also claimed that some 6,000 apartments are currently in various
stages of construction in the territories.  When they are inhabited,
the apartments will provide a significant boost to the population of
the Israeli settlements.  In the organization's view this will
seriously harm the political process.

It further claims that overall some 3,800 housing units have been
completed this year in the area dubbed Greater Jerusalem after the
work was approved by the special ministerial committee.  Another
3,900 apartments will be built over the next year or so in the area
between Ma'ale Adumim, the Etyzon Bloc and Giv'at Ze'ev.

Peace Now surveyed each Israeli settlement individually.  It claims
that the total number of apartments under construction last year is
the largest number since the Likud government.  If all the apartments
currently being built are inhabited, some 25,000 additional settlers
will be moving in.

However, the government rejected the organization's claims.
According to the then housing and construction minister, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, the ministerial committee charged with approving
construction projects in the occupied territories had approved the
construction of only 500 housing units in Ma'ale Adumim, the
continued construction of some 500 housing units in Betar, and work
on privately-owned land in Giv'at Ze'ev, which had not yet started.

As for Tel Aviv, the minister did admit that some 95,000 housing
units are being built, with a further 1,100 housing units in Psigat
Ze'ev in Greater Jerusalem.

LEBANON
The continuing state of tension in the Israeli security zone in
southern Lebanon rose by several more degrees in October when six
Israeli soldiers were killed by a booby-trap bomb in the eastern
sector.  The deaths provoked a massive Israeli reaction of targeted
air attacks over the next several weeks.  Each of which was met with
retaliatory action from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) and Hezbollah.

In mid-November Israel intensified its bombardment of southern areas
and carried out a massive air attack against PFLP-GC positions in the
Na'mah hills, inflicting a large number of fatalities.  Following the
attack, the PFLP-GC reportedly began dismantling its bases in Na'mah
as a precautionary measure against further strikes.

As for the bombardment, attacks on alleged Hezbollah villages on
November 27 reportedly killed a number of ranking members of the
organization.  Hezbollah claimed that Israel used nail and
fragmentation bombs in the attack and said it had it had no honorable
alternative but to respond with the weapons it has to hand, namely
the Katyusha rockets.

The next day Hezbollah fired a "relatively large number" of Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel in two salvos.  The missiles struck the
area around Qiryat Shimona in the Galilee but there were no reported
fatalities.

The attack produced fury in Israel, with Prime Minister stating that
the attack was a blatant breach of the understanding reached after
the Israeli operation in Lebanon n 1993.  He went on to assign full
responsibility to the Lebanese and Syrian governments.  In
particular, he noted that Syria had to be held responsible for the
actions of Hezbollah because it has a military deployment in the
country.

Backing up the prime minister, deputy defense minister Ori Or said
Israel will make Hezbollah, Lebanon and Syria "pay the price" for the
attacks.  However, the military had already issued a statement that
Syria had nothing to do with the attacks.  Israel is also limited in
its response by its need to keep the peace process on track.  After
all this is the fifth time Israel has vowed to retaliate after
Katyushas have been fired into northern Israel, and it has not done
so yet.

So, the result has been more of the same. On November 28 a member of
Hezbollah's security committee in Jibshit was killed when his car was
blown up, either form a bomb or a rocket fired by an Israeli plane.
On November 30 Israeli warplanes carried out three air raids on the
ridges located between Mashgharah and Ayn al-Tinah firing 500 and
1,000-pound air-to-ground missiles.

Israel is also still enforcing its restriction on maritime traffic
inside Lebanese territorial waters. In Late October it was reported
that Israel had stepped up its patrols all along the coast between
Naqurah and Sarafand, imposing a tight blockade on the ports from
which Lebanese fishermen operate.  Fishing boats also claim to have
been subjected to machine-gun fire along the coast south of Tyre.

On November 19, Israeli gunboats detained two Lebanese fishermen.
They were released the next day with a map stipulating that fishing
is only allowed in a one-kilometer area off Tyre's northern beaches.
On November 30, Israeli gunboats seized two ships with a cargo of
cars heading for Tyre.

ISRAEL
ECONOMY

In addition to saying that he would hold the Rabin line on the peace
process, Prime Minister Peres also committed himself to pursuing the
same general thrust in economic policy.  That, however, is a line he
may find difficult to hold.

Certainly, the past few years have been the best ever in Israel's
socioeconomic history with GDP growth averaging nearly 5.6% over from
1991 through 1994.  However inflation has been stubbornly resistant
to the government's tight monetary policy.  Although the rate fell to
around 9% last year from 12.3% in 1994, growth started to pick up
rapidly in the second half of the year, stoking up inflationary
pressures.   Growth last year could well have been as high as 6.8%.
This year Finance Minister Avraham Shohat has forecast a GDP growth
of 6.8% and there is a strong possibility that inflation will rise
again.

This is alarming.  Interest rates are already very high.  In October
last the central bank raised its key lending rate charged to
commercial banks 13.7% to 14.2%.  This brought a sharp halt to a
gradual fall in  the rate from a high of 17% in November 1994.

Moreover, the budget deficit situation is also worsening.  According
to the latest forecasts, the fiscal deficit is expected to turn out
at 3.6% of GDP in 1995, compared with 0.9% in 1994 and well in excess
of the government target of 2.75%.

European Union
Israel and the EU signed an economic agreement at the EU's Council of
Ministers in Brussels on November 20.  This is the largest and most
important international economic agreement signed by Israel.  It
replaces the agreement signed about 20 years ago and includes
elements that will improve and enhance the ties between Israel and
the EU countries.

JORDAN
POLITICS

Concern is rising both in the government and abroad over the
heightened level of opposition to the peace agreement with Israel.
The problem was brought into focus by a recent debate on the peace
process in parliament in which a number of deputies opposed the
government line.  The opposition was led by the Islamic Action Front,
but supported by more than 13 nationalist, leftist and even centrist
deputies.

This was followed by the rejection of the government's normalization
of relations with Israel by the trade unions.  The government was
also discomfited when in a democratic election the Islamists and
leftists who oppose the it scored a landslide victory in the branch
elections of the Jordan Engineers' Association.

This has led some observers to claim the country is teetering on the
brink of a bloody confrontation between proponents and opponents of
the peace.  Their argument is that this fundamental political
division in the country is exacerbated by Jordan's purely domestic
problems such as the high level of unemployment which is officially
put at 18% of the workforce, growing poverty and hardship, and the
widespread corruption in the government and bureaucracy.

This mix is made worse, they contend, by Jordan's open door policy on
immigration.  Thus, Islamic militants have moved into Jordan from
other countries in the region with the express intent of fomenting
trouble.  Finally, there is the continuous external pressure
generated by the continued UN sanctions against Iraq and the
suffering of its people to the east and the stand-off between Syria
and Israel to the north.

This does at least appear to have the USA worried.  According to the
Jordanian newspaper Akhbar al-Usbu, the USA has been involved in
secret discussion with exiled Jordanian opposition groups and some
opposition groups inside the country.

Also, the government's move in October and November to cut the number
of foreign workers in the country cannot be entirely unconnected with
these concerns.  According to Labor Minister Nader Abu el-Shaer, the
foreign workforce of around 250,000 was cut by 70,000 in October
alone.  The hope is that this action will both cut down on the number
of potential foreign agitators and help to ease the unemployment
situation for low-paid workers.

Saudi Arabia
To King Hussein's enormous relief, normal relations have been
restored with Saudi Arabia and ambassadors exchanged.  The Saudi
ambassador arrived in Amman on November 11.  King Hussein is expected
to make a visit to Saudi Arabia soon.

It was also announced that the defunct pipeline, which used to carry
40,000 barrels of Saudi oil to Jordan daily, is to be repaired and
put back into operation.

Iraq
Despite the improvement in relations with Saudi Arabia, King Hussein
is still treading a political tightrope in his relations with Iraq.
So far his condemnation of the regime has been in non-specific terms
and he has taken care not to criticize Saddam Hussein personally.
This has been essential in that Jordan is still economically
dependent on Iraq (for details of the recent trade agreement see the
Iraq report in this issue) and that the majority of the Jordanian
people are sympathetic to the political message emanating from
Baghdad.

At the same time, however, he cannot afford to alienate either Saudi
Arabia or Kuwait.  To this end, King Hussein reportedly made contacts
with some Iraqi opposition groups during his private visit to London
recently.  This, however, brought criticism from a rather unusual
quarter, the pretender to the Iraqi throne, Sharif Ali Bin
al-Hussein.  In late November Sharif Ali, who is a member of the
Hashemite family to which King Hussein belongs, said such contacts
constituted a threat to the integrity of Iraq.

Apparently, Sharif Ali, who heads an organization called the Iraqi
Constitutional Monarchy Movement and hopes to have himself installed
as a constitutional monarch in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is brought
down, fears that Iraq in its present divided state is ripe for
break-up and sees the threat of a confederation between Jordan and
the rump of Iraq should the Kurds succeed in breaking away.

Israel
Despite the domestic protests, however, relations with Israel
continue to forge ahead.  On October 25 the two countries singed a
trade deal which is expected to led to a rapid increase in trade
between them.  Under it Israel has granted Jordan 20-50% exemptions
from customs on most Jordanian industrial products, including cement,
furniture, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and toys.  For its part Jordan
has agreed to reduce its tariffs by 10% on a wide range of Israeli
products, including plywood, tires, foodstuffs, electronic
components, medical and communications equipment and pharmaceuticals.

The agreement takes account of the difference between the Israeli and
Jordanian economies: per capita income in Jordan is less than a
quarter of the level in Israel.  The agreement will be in effect for
three years, after which the terms will be renegotiated.

JORDAN
FINANCE

Jordan finally got its second debt write-off deal with the USA on
September 25.  Under the first deal US$220 million was canceled,
while the second deal removed a further US$400 or so to bring the
total amount of debt canceled to around US$640 million, around 10% of
the country's total foreign debt.

Also in September Japan announced its intention to extend
grants-in-aid totaling N1.12 billion to Jordan.  The aid consists of
N547 million to finance a project aimed at combating oil spill in the
north of the Gulf of Aqaba, N550 million to help the country purchase
agricultural machinery to boost food production, and N24 million
cultural grant-in-aid to help Jordan's radio and TV corporation
purchase educational TV programs.

In late October Japan also announced that it is to provide US$215
million aid package, including a US$135 million loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan, to help alleviate Jordan's foreign
exchange shortage.

Last but not least, the European Union is to provide a grant of 20
million European Currency Units (Ecu) to help the kingdom implement
its economic reform program.  The money will be used to finance
projects in the fields of health, education, social development and
water.

In October Moody's Investors Service assigned a Ba3 long term rating
to Jordan's foreign currency debt, while and Standard & Poor's
assigned a B+ rating for the country's foreign currency debt and a
BBB rating for local currency debt.

POLITICS

The country has been discomfited by the call by the United Arab
Emirates for the sanctions against Iraq to be lifted.  It has also
not been pleased for the support for the call from both Qatar and
Yemen.

Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers decided on November 29 to grant a
maximum grace period of one year for those who have not yet managed
to prove their Kuwaiti nationality since the 1965 census.  The aim of
the ruling is to set an absolute deadline on the nationality
registration process. The cabinet also approved the use of DNA
techniques to investigate the family connections claimed by some of
those seeking Kuwaiti nationality.

KUWAIT
ECONOMY

Privatization
The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) said in November that it now
expects the privatization program to be completed before the target
date of end 1998 as a result of the increasing demand from investors
for shares in the parastatals due to be hived off.

Up to the end of October, the KIA - the body charged by the
government with executing the privatization program - had sold shares
worth Kd310 million (approximately US$1 billion).  Up to that date,
some 15,000 people had subscribed to the shares sold and the monthly
share trading figure had increased from an average of Kd45.3 million
in the first half of 1994 to Kd248.7 million in the first half of
1995.

Private deposits increased from Kd5.5 billion in June 1994 to Kd6.1
billion in August 1995.  In addition the central bank had registered
a decrease in the amount of transfers abroad.

The increase in average share prices in the stock market has led to
similar increases in the value of the portfolio of local shares held
by the state through the KIA.  The value of this portfolio has
increased by more than Kd300 million since July 1994.

The KIA holds more than 10% of the equity of 28 companies.  This
stake is worth around Kd9.24 billion.  Approximately 34.5% of this
total is in the banking sector, some 20.6% in the manufacturing
sector and around 20.5% in the service sector.

Oil Sector
Meanwhile, Oil Minister, Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij, said in
September that the level of investment the private sector could
contribute to the oil industry after 1997 could be as much as US$10
million.

He said that the Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is planning to
increase its oil production to three million barrels per day (b/d) by
the beginning of the next century and to around 3.5 million b/d by
the year 2005.  As for the refining sector, the plans are to increase
the volume of oil refined by Kuwait refineries from 800,000 b/d to
around one million b/d by the year 2000.

Prior to the November meeting of OPEC oil and energy ministers in
November, Mid'ij appeared to be urging his partners to raise Kuwait's
production ceiling from 2.0 million b/d to 2.2 million b/d.  However,
Mid'ij also talked of wanting to raise the oil price to US$21/bbl.
Given the excess capacity in the market and an oil price at the time
of around US$16/bbl, the two aims were clearly incompatible.

In the event the OPEC meeting decided to keep the organization's
overall production ceiling at 24.52 million b/d up to the end of June
this year.  As a result, the production ceilings of all member
countries, including Kuwait, will remain the same.  By maintaining
total output against a forecast rise n global demand of 1.4 million
b/d this year, OPEC is hoping that the oil price will rise
significantly towards the US$21/bbl figure this year.

It was announced in October that a new oil deposit has been
discovered in the Kira al-Maru, in western Kuwait.  Outflow from the
new discovery started on October 19.  The outflow is of light oil ,
the first time such oil has been discovered in the area.

The Kuwait Oil Company's exploration at Kira al-Maru began in June
1990, but was halted by the Iraqi invasion.  Work resumed in February
1994.  Preliminary estimates indicate that deposits in the new field
amount to 300-400 million barrels.

Foreign Economic Relations
The Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) signed a memorandum of
understanding with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in September on the
setting up of a joint oil refinery with an estimated annual capacity
of about six million tonnes - which could be increased to 10 million
tonnes - at a cost of more than US$1 billion.

The project is to be set up and operated in the state of Orissa in
northeast India by a new joint company.  The KPC and IOC will each
hold 26% of the shares of the joint company, while the remaining
shares, 48%, will be offered to individuals and institutions in
India.

The financing of the project depends on the use of the paid capital
and foreign loans.

MOROCCO
POLITICS

Despite the current economic difficulties, the kingdom retains its
moderate political risk.  However, in that King Hassan, by virtue of
his near absolute powers, is the key to political stability there
were some anxious moments in late October when his was taken ill in
New York in the USA.

The king apparently caught influenza which then deteriorated into an
acute respiratory infection.  Although he has apparently recovered
fully and has returned home, he has been advised to take several
weeks recuperation.

Corruption
Meanwhile, the government's latest attempt to cut back on the blatant
corruption in the country resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000
people in mid November.  The arrests resulted from the latest
anti-corruption measures and most of the detentions - 826 - were made
in and around the port city of Casablanca, while the center-north
came second with 423.  Most of those arrested were charged with
attempting to bribe policemen.

The number of arrests sounds impressive but in reality can barely be
described as even the tip of the iceberg.  The whole of the
bureaucracy in Morocco is riven with bribery and "baksheesh", in
which paying policemen to turn a blind eye to parking offenses and
traffic violations is but a minor part.  It is virtually impossible
for a citizen to obtain a building permit, birth certificate, death
certificate or any other official document without money changing
hands under the counter.

Political Terrorism
Although Morocco has no domestic problem with political terrorism,
proof positive has emerged that some of its citizens are taking
advantage of the terrorist activity in neighboring Algeria with the
arrest of a group of arms' smugglers on the Moroccan side of the
border.

Although the arrests were made in mid-September, they were not
announced until mid-October.  There were 17 members in the group, 12
Moroccans and five Algerians.  According to the government, the
Moroccans were either small traders or unemployed, aged between 25
and 40.  The Algerians are believed to be members of the Algerian
terrorist group Groupe Armi Islamique (GIA).  They face prison
sentences of 5-20 years.

Western Sahara
The registration process of voters in the referendum on the future
status of the territory, scheduled for January 1996, continues at a
snail's pace.  In July, the Moroccan government suddenly presented a
further 100,000 application forms for Moroccans its claims originated
from Western Sahara.  This has snarled up the registration process to
such an extent that in November the President of the self-styled
Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Abdelaziz, wrote to
the UN secretary-general warning that the whole process was on the
point of impasse.

Meanwhile, the first elected Saharan National Assembly was installed
at the refugee camps in Tindouf on October 12, to coincide with the
20th anniversary of the proclamation of the SADR. The Assembly
consists of 101 members.

In November, the SADR's armed wing, the Polisario Front released 186
Moroccan prisoners of war.  These men had been released in 1989, but
the Moroccan government refused to receive them on the grounds that
there were no Moroccan POWs.

Relations between the SADR and the Moroccan government also came
under further strain in August, when Morocco opened talks with Russia
on renewing the three-year fishing accord that permits Russian ships
to fish off the Western Saharan coast.

The SADR has always regarded the accord, which was signed in August
1992 as, a deliberate provocation that runs counter to the
UN-brokered peace plan signed by both sides in August 1988.  It also
regards the accord as being part of Morocco's policy of establishing
international legitimacy to its claim of sovereignty over the region
in advance of the referendum.  The accord was the first signed by
Morocco which was limited exclusively to the Western Sahara.

European Union
The long-running dispute with the European Union (EU) over fishing
rights was finally brought to a conclusion on November 15 last as
part of a new partnership agreement.  The EU had hoped to get the
fishing treaty out of the way before the trade accord was dealt with.
However, Morocco, realizing the leverage the fishing deal gave it in
negotiations on the accord hung on until the EU was forced to
consider both together.  The overall result is that Morocco has
secured both agreements under arguably better terms than it would
have done.

It has been a tough negotiation.  When Morocco refused to renew the
existing fisheries agreement when it expired on April 30 last year,
relations between Morocco and the EU, particularly Spain, plunged.
With its fishing vessels barred from Moroccan waters, Spain faced the
loss of around 40,000 jobs in its fishing industry.

Pressure was also on the EU in general as it wanted the partnership
agreement drawn up before the Euro-Mediterranean conference which was
held in Barcelona on November 27/28.  It was also important in that
the EU sees partnership agreements with the countries of the Maghreb
as an essential contributor to stability on its southern flank.

The new fisheries agreement, which comes into effect on September 1,
1996, is for a non-renewable four years.  During this period Morocco
will modernize its fishing fleet, expand its structure and ports,
train seamen and prepare a scientific research program to manage its
fish resources.  For its part, the EU will provide financial aid to
fund these tasks and has undertaken to restructure its fleet and
gradually reduce its use of Moroccan territorial waters.  To this
end, the EU's financial contribution of Ecu102 million is to be
raised by 20-30%.

Over the period of the agreement, has agreed to cut its catch of
molluscs by 40% and of crustaceans by 34%.  The catch of other
species is also to be reduced.  At the same time, EU vessels are
obliged to land 30% of their catches in Moroccan ports.   Moroccan
waters on condition that there is a gradual reduction of the volume
of fishing over the coming four years at a rate of 40% for molluscs
and 34% for crustaceans and a percentage of the EU ships' cargoes are
unloaded at Moroccan ports.  EU fishermen have also committed
themselves to respecting the biological rest period to allow stocks
to recover and to employing one or more Moroccan sailors per vessel.

The partnership agreement provides improved access to the EU markets
for Morocco's agricultural produce and is a key element in the EU's
strategy to create a Euro-Med free trade zone by 2010.

MOROCCO
ECONOMY

Following a government report in September that economic growth will
slow, and that unemployment, the budget deficit and inflation will
climb if current policies are not changed, King Hassan announced in
October that Morocco is to introduce a series of five-year plans, the
first covering the period from 1995 until 2000.

Addressing the House of Representatives on the opening of the new
parliamentary term on October 13, the king said he had asked the
World Bank in June to carry out analyses of three areas of concern to
him:  education, administrative reforms and Morocco's future policy
on economic, financial and trade issues.  He said the World Bank's
reports on the first two subjects, which he had recently received,
had made "painful" reading.

On that basis, said the king, he had reached the conclusion that the
problems and the challenges are so great that they must be tackled
through a "full and comprehensive" national debate.  In particular,
the king pointed out that the year of drought had put enormous
pressure on the country and that it faced some difficult debt
repayment hurdles in 1997 and 1998.

The September report forecast that the drought will cut agricultural
output by around 56% this year, with a concomitant fall in the GDP of
4-5%.   As the 1995 budget had forecast a growth of 2.5%, it appears
that the country will suffer a negative growth in real terms.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade turnover increased by 3.4% in the first six months
of 1995. Exports totaled Md53,886 million in the period, compared
Md52,113 million in the same period of 1994.

The export of food products increased by 14.1% to Md5,367 million,
from Md4,703 million in the same period of 1994.  Exports of energy
products rose from Md13,000 million in 1994 to Md14,326 million,
while phosphate exports increased by 14%, or Md94 million, to Md769
million from Md675 million in 1994.

Overall, imports declined.  However, there was a sharp 8.1% increase
in the import of food products, mainly cereals, as a result of the
drought.  The trade deficit in the period was reduced by 6.9% to
Md15,889 million.

SAUDI ARABIA
POLITICS

Concerns about the health of 74-year old King Fahd rose again when he
was admitted to the King Faysal specialist hospital in Riyadh on
November 29.  Official statements said that he entered hospital for a
routine medical check up and that he is fit and well.  However, King
Fahd is beleived to be terminally ill with advanced kidney failure.
As a result, he frequently loses consciousness and has to receive
blood transfusions to compensate for the occasional heavy bleeding
resulting from his condition.

Under those circumtances, it is not surprising that the rumor flew
around the Middle East that the king had actually suffered a minor
stroke.  The idea that the visit was indeed more than routine was
given further credence by the flurry of goodwill and get well
messages from other Arab leaders.  After all, if he hadn't been ill,
what was the point?

Terrorism
But while concerns over the health of the king have been around for
some time now, concerns over terrorist activity in the kingdom have
not.  That nonchalance was rapidly expelled in October and November
when first a mosque and then the a US military installation were
bombed.

No organization has claimed responsibility for the first attack, on a
mosque in Quba in the Bishah region in late October.  From the scant
details available, it appears a Saudi threw a bomb into the mosque
while people were at prayer. Six people were killed and 101 injured
in the explosion.  The bomber escaped the scene but was hunted down
and cornered in a mountainous area in the province of Namas.  There
was apparently an exchange of gunfire in which one policeman was
killed.  The man then blew himself up.

There is, as yet, no evidence to connect this to the second incident
on November 13 when a car bomb was detonated outside a US military
communications center in the capital Riyadh.  Six people were killed
and over 60 injured.   Part of the three-story building collapsed and
buildings were damaged up to half a kilometer away.  The bombers
escaped without detection.

A few days later, the government denied that there had also been
unsuccessful attempts to blow up the offices of the Defense Ministry
and the Petromin (General Petroleum and Minerals Organization).

The bombing in Riyadh, in particular, is a serious warning that even
a state as rigidly controlled as Saudi Arabia is not immune to the
forces of militant Islam that are wreaking such havoc elsewhere in
the Middle East and appears to be in line with a growing radicalism
in the kingdom.  First came the establishment and subsequent crushing
of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in May
1993 and the roundup of hundreds of clerics and dissident academics
in the north-western province of Qasim last year.  This year,
leaflets have been circulated in Riyadh warning foreigners to desist
from involving themselves in Saudi affairs.

It appears that general dissatisfactions, domestically because of the
two-year recession, and abroad because of what is seen by the public
as the poor deal meted out to the Palestinians in the peace agreement
with Israel, have coalesced into an opposition to the presence in the
kingdom of not only foreign, but non-Arab and non-Muslim forces.
There is another problem.  At least 5,000 Saudi youths received
combat training in Afghanistan.  Some estimate the number could be as
high as 10,000.  The presence of such a large number of experienced
fundamentalist fighters outside of the government's control.  The
three groups that have claimed responsibility for the Riyadh bombing
have almost certainly been drawn from their ranks.

According to Dr Muhammad al-Mas'ari, the official spokesman of the
exiled CDLR, now based in London, England, these groups have carried
out no actions up to now because they could not obtain a fatwa to
carry out an armed attack on foreign forces in the kingdom.  The
basis they used to request such a fatwa is a religious ruling which
stipulates that no non-Islamic force, armed or not, should be present
in the Arabian Peninsula.  This ruling applies to the whole Islamic
world and precludes Muslims everywhere from seeking help from
non-Muslims in the Arabian peninsula.

However, requests for a fatwa have been consistently rejected by such
distinguished clerics and leaders such as Safar al-Hawali, Salman
al-Awdah and others.  The presumption by many is that a fatwa has now
been secured from a leading cleric outside of the kingdom.

The organizations that have claimed responsibility for the bombing
are the Tigers of the Gulf, the Partisans of God, , and the Jihad
Wing of the Islamic Movement for Change.  Only the last of these
groups is known.   However all previous statements from the Jihad
Wing, demanding that all foreign forces leave the Arabian peninsula,
have been made in writing.  All of the claims of responsibility for
the Riyadh bombing have been made by telephone.

Although the attack automatically increases the political terrorism
threat component in our assessment of Saudi Arabia's political risk,
we do not see the threat as great on current evidence.

Finally, and to the intense embarrassment of all concerned, it became
known in November that the US security forces had arrested one of its
servicemen, a Lt-Col Michael Schwart, in September on suspicion of
spying for Saudi Arabia.  Schwart was serving in the US naval
intelligence base in Riyadh when he was arrested.

However, Schwart has not been charged with espionage and betraying
his country.  This treatment stands in sharp contrast to that of
another US citizen, Jonathan Pollard, who has spent 10 years in jail
for spying for Israel.  In recognition of his work, the Israeli
government granted Pollard Israeli citizenship in late November.

Government Changes
After only three months in the job, Dr. Sulaymani Bin Abd al-Aziz
al-Salim resigned as finance and national economy minister on October
9.  The official reason given for his sudden departure is the state
of his health.  Given that he has a history of heart trouble and has
been treated for the same in London, there is no obvious reason to
presume ulterior reasons.

He was replaced on the same day by Dr Abd al-Aziz bin Abdullah
al-Khuwaytir.  Al-Khuwaytir had been education minister since 1975,
but was appointed minister without portfolio in the August reshuffle
that put Al-Salim into finance.

There are considerable differences between the two men.  Al-Salim
could be regarded as a technocrat, despite his long experience in
government (he had been commerce minister for 20 years before his
appointment to finance).  Despite this long service, Al-Salim is
still only 54 years old and is held in high regard in the USA as well
as Saudi Arabia.

Al-Khuwaytir, on the other hand is considerably older at 68 and much
more of an insider, being much more of a trusted retainer to the king
than just a minister.  Thus while Al-Salim's appointment could be
seen as a signal that King Fahd had finally decided to allow decisive
new action to be taken in the management of the economy, his
replacement gives the impression of a "steady-as-she-goes" approach,
with little prospect of fundamental change.

This difference between the two men is so stark that most
commentators believe that Al-Khuwaytir's appointment is only
temporary and that he will soon be replaced by another, younger
financial or economic technician.  The top names currently touted are
Hamad Al-Sayari, the 54-year old governor of the Saudi central bank
and Ahmad Abdul Latif, the 60-year old president of the Arab Banking
Corporation.

However, there is always the possibility that Al-Salim's resignation
had more to do with the way he was running his portfolio than his
health, and that King Fahd did not like the proposed changes of
direction.  If that is the case, then the appointment of
Al-Khuwaytir, who can be relied on to have much the same mind set as
the king, could be a great deal more permanent than is presumed.  It
would also indicate that reforms, if any, will be conducted at a much
slower pace.

SAUDI ARABIA
ECONOMY

An indicator that King Fahd may be backtracking on his commitment to
reform is the government's claim in November that it has now managed
to overcome its financial difficulties and that these were anyway
exaggerated by the foreign media.

In particular, the government statement claimed that the financial
deficit in the first half of 1995 had been reduced to 2% of GDP,
compared with a deficit of about 9% in 1994.  The deficit in the
foreign current account in the period was also reduced to 2% of GDP,
from 8% in 1994.

The problem is that this improvement is almost entirely due to the
strengthening of international oil prices last year.  The reform
process began last year with an austerity budget designed to cut
spending by 6% to US$40 billion in order to pull the budget deficit
down to US$4 billion.  This compares with deficits of US$37.62
billion in 1991, US$-11.13 billion in 1992, US$9.53 billion in 1993,
and US$10.68 billion in 1994.

However, the oil revenue projections in the budget were based on an
oil price of only US$14/bbl.  However, oil prices averaged
US$15.50/bbl through most of last year.  This extra income, probably
somewhere in excess of US$3 billion, has been the major contributor
to the country's improved financial situation.

However, the real imbalances in the economy, such as the growing
unemployment among the educated young, the sharp rise in inflation
(up to 6% from 1-2%), and government payment arrears of US$405
billion, are still there.  Complacency now could be disastrous.

YEMEN
POLITICS

Although there has been a significant improvement n the overall
security situation since the civil war, crimes against property are
rife, particularly in Aden.  There is also a good deal of fraud being
perpetrated over land contracts.

There has also been some attempted terrorism of late.  A group of
what the government called "sabotage elements" were arrested at the
end of September in Aden and another group in mid-November.  They are
not believed to be related to the militant Islamic groups in Egypt,
but to the defeated Yemeni Socialist Party, whose leadership was
forced to flee the country after its defeat in the civil war in 1994.

The government admits that yet other groups could still be at large
and the possibility of at least isolated acts of terrorism cannot be
discounted.  In an effort to reduce the risk, the government has
deported some 4,000 Algerian, Libyan, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals
in October and November.  According to Prime Minister al-Ghani, the
aim of the deportation program was to prevent Aden being used as a
base for terrorist activities against its neighbors.  Particular
effort has been made to locate and detain any Egyptian nationals
believed to be conspiring against the Egyptian state.

A new minister for expatriate affairs, Fadl Muhammad bin Aydarut
al-Afifi, was appointed on November 11.

Foreign Relations
The rapprochement with Saudi Arabia appears to be continuing
according to plan.  The third Saudi-Yemeni joint committee for border
demarcation held its third session in San'a during November 5-9 in a
reportedly friendly and cooperative atmosphere.  Agreement was
reached to start implementing the time table of the technical field
work of border demarcation.  The fourth session is due to begin on
December 25.

Although relations with Saudi Arabia are clearly on an improving
track, relations with Kuwait remain sticky.  Deputy prime minister
and foreign minister Abnd al-Karim al-Iryani went some way towards
allaying Kuwaiti concerns in late October when he said that Yemen had
never adopted a policy supporting or entrenching the occupation of
Kuwait and that claims to the contrary were a falsification of
Yemen's position.

However, the effect of this was rather spoilt when Yemen later
supported the call by the United Arab Emirates for the UN sanctions
against Iraq to be lifted.

Eritrea
Yemen has also managed to blunder into a territorial dispute with
Eritrea over three Red Sea islands - Hunaysh al-Kubra, Zukar and
Hunaysh al-Sughrah.  The islands have been occupied by Yemen, which
is hoping to develop them as tourist centers.

In mid-November Eritrean naval patrols attempted to land on one of
the islands when it appeared that tourists facilities were under
construction there.  Yemeni military units on the island prevented
the Eritreans from landing.  In response Eritrea warned Yemeni
military units and fishermen to evacuate the island on the basis that
it is disputed territory.

In an effort to cool the situation the two sides have agreed to a
series of talks on the status of the islands.  The first of these
meetings took place in San'a on November 22.

YEMEN
ECONOMY

This year is to be the first in a new five-year plan extending to the
year 2000 aimed at establishing the primary development projects in
order to provide a base for the future development of the economy.
The government says the plan will be carried out in line with the
commitments it has already made to maintain its economic reform
programs, combat financial and administrative corruption, improve
production, and encourage investment, exports, trade exchange and
competition.  Apart from oil and gas developments, particular
attention is to be paid to agriculture, tourism and fishery
resources.

The key to Yemen's future economic development is oil and gas.  In
this respect, a major step forward was achieved in September with the
signing of the final agreement on a project to liquefy and export
natural gas with the French company Total.  Negotiations are under
way with the US companies Hunt and Exxon with the aim of having them
participate in the project as well.  South Korea has already put
itself forward as a potential buyer of Yemeni gas.

Overall, the US$3 billion project is forecast to produce five million
tonnes of natural gas a year for 25 years.  This will produce an
annual revenues of about US$600, the bulk of which will be earmarked
to boost agricultural and industrial development, and improve
services.

Another major project is the development and modernization of the
Aden refinery.  Bids for the work have been tendered by foreign
companies and are currently being studied.  The project should get
underway this year.

Currently, oil production is concentrated in two areas - Sector No.
18 in Ma'rib and Jawf and Sector No. 14 in the Masilah area in
Hadhramawt Governorate - which jointly produce about 350,000 barrels
per day (b/d).  Crude oil production from these fields is expected to
increase this year due to the continued drilling of development wells
and to the coming on stream of new fields in the Jannah area, known
as Sector No. 5.  This should add around 25,000 b/d to next year's
output total.  Also due to come into operation soon are the Farid and
Atud fields in the eastern part of Shabwah, known as Sector No. 10.
Initial production from these fields is expected to be 12,000 b/d.

Overall, some 26 international companies are carrying out surveys or
exploratory drilling operations in the country and the potential for
further major discoveries appears high.  Total has already been
discovered oil in commercial quantities at Qaribah and Hisn
al-Karadis in eastern Shabwah.  On that basis the government is
expecting to increase its overall oil production by up to 60,000 b/d
this year.  Following the completion of oil pipeline projects, output
should rise to 500,000 b/d.  Natural gas output is expected to reach
six million tonnes a year and should be able to be increased to seven
million tonnes.

BOTSWANA
POLITICS

Ethnic and regionally based tensions within the ruling Botswana
Democratic Party (BDP) look set to heighten over the coming year
following recent changes to the party's constitution that will limit
a president to two successive terms in office.

The new restriction is borne out of a dispute that has raged between
the northern-based Merahfe and primarily southern Kwelagobe factions
of the BDP since mid-1994.  During the last presidential and
legislative elections - held in October 1994 - the Merahfe gained
control of a larger number of seats in the 40-seat National Assembly
than the Kwelagobe faction.  This led to calls from the Merahfe for
changes to the constitution that would ensure all tribes would be
given equal status.  However, these calls were rejected by the
Kwelagobe, which enjoys the support of President Masire, and has,
since the country's independence from the UK in 1966, been the
faction from which the ruling elite has predominantly been drawn.

Masire's continued support of the Kwelagobe position caused a good
deal of anger amongst the Merahfe.  The ensuing row resulted in the
Merahfe collaborating with the opposition Botswana National Front
(BNF) to install Moutlakgola Nwako, a long-time opponent of Masire,
as speaker of the House.  The subsequent limiting of presidential
terms is a result of both the renewed vigor of the Merahfe in
pursuing their aim and a recognition on the part of Masire that,
despite the next elections being some four years off, without some
degree of internal reconciliation, the BDP faces the possibility of a
split so damaging that it would end its 29 year-old hold on power.

Just how far the recent change will go in lessening the Merahfe's
belief that it is treated as a second class faction within the BDP is
unclear.  Any hopes that they may have had that Masire, who has held
office since 1980, far in excess of two terms, would resign in order
that a new, Merahfe, president could take over, were quickly dampened
when Masire said that changes to the constitution were not meant for
an individual and that he retained the right to resign when he
pleased.

Masire's position was underlined by BDP chairman, Ponatshego
Kedikilwe, when he responded to a press report in The Botswana
Gazette that suggested that Masire would leave office at the end of
this term as a result of the constitutional change.  According to
Kedikilwe, the two term restriction will only apply from the 1999
elections and will not be retrospective.  Neither does the resolution
prevent someone who has been president before continuing for the two
term period.  This leaves the Merahfe facing the prospect of Masire
remaining in office until 2009 should the BDP continue to maintain
electoral success.

Given that prospect, and the growing resentment in the
Merahfe-controlled north of the country that the bulk of the
Botswana's impressive GDP growth over the last ten years has
benefited a tiny proportion of the population that happen to live in
and around the southern capital, Gabarone, the possibility of a
formal split along regional and ethnic lines remains very much alive.

The danger to the BDP as it now is, is compounded by the growth in
popularity of the opposition BNF.  The BNF quadrupled its support in
the 1994 elections to come out holding 13 of the 40 available seats
in the National Assembly.  Of the remaining 27 seats, the majority
are held by the Merahfe.  Should that faction decide to leave what
looks increasingly more like an uneasy coalition than a unified
party, the 1999 elections could prove to be wide open.

BOTSWANA
ECONOMY

Many of the political problems faced by Masire's government are the
result of problems with the economy.  Despite GDP growth of around 6%
a year for the last five years and, at US$2,600, a relatively high
annual GDP per head, the figures mask vast inequalities in the
distribution of both wealth and jobs.  Some 75% of the population
live in impoverished rural areas and are dependent on the subsistence
agriculture and cattle farming that tends to be omitted from economic
performance figures.  Botswana's geography is particularly
unforgiving to farmers in that much of the countryside is made up of
the sandy lands of the Kalahari desert.

The modern sector of Botswana's economy suffers from the fact that it
is highly dependent on its minerals sector.  The country is the
world's leading producer of top quality diamonds and also exports
copper-nickel ore, coal and soda ash.  This dependence on mining
leaves the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices for its
commodities.  Such fluctuations were responsible for the downturn in
growth experienced during 1992/93.

While development of the mining sector has been responsible for the
country's impressive GDP figures, distribution of that growth in
wealth has been restricted by the fact that the mining sector only
employs some 4% of the labor force.  In addition, the country's three
largest mines are in private, South African, ownership.

In the modern sector of the economy as a whole, unemployment runs at
around 25%.  In an attempt to keep the lid on the situation, the
government has become the country's largest employer, taking up some
30% of the modern sector workforce.  This has resulted in an
inefficient collection of parastatals which, according to a recent
report from the auditor general's office, are losing millions of pula
a year.  The report says that the Botswana Agricultural Marketing
Board has lost some Bp4 million this year alone and is unlikely to
continue trading without continued government support.

Attempts by the government to draw foreign investors into sectors
other than mining in order to diversify the economy and reduce its
vulnerability to commodity price changes have met with little
success.  Manufacturing still accounts for less than 10% of exports.

In addition to creating employment in the public sector and trying to
draw in foreign investment, the government actively encourages
workers to find jobs abroad.  Estimates suggest that some 40,000
Botswanans follow this path every year.  The vast majority find work
in neighboring South Africa, source of some 85% of Botswana's
imports.

While a modest rise in the price of diamonds on the world markets
this year has helped Botswana to some extent, the government fears
that if diversification does not come quickly, a possible saturation
of the market by Russian diamond sales may do considerable harm to
both the economic and political stability of the country.  Should
that turn out to be the case, the likelihood of foreign investors
moving in to the country will diminish.

COTE D'IVOIRE
POLITICS

Coming hard on the heels of  President Konan Bedie's controversial
presidential reelection of October 22, the ruling Democratic Party of
Cote d'Iviore - African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA) is sure to have
maintained, albeit at a slightly reduced level, its hold on power
following the November 26 parliamentary polls.

Unlike the presidential elections, which were subject to a boycott by
the country's two main opposition parties, both the Ivorian Popular
Front (IFP) and the Rally of Republicans (RDR) took part in the
legislative poll.  With counting completed for 151 of the 172
contested, the PDCI-RDA had secured 133 with both the IFP and RDR
claiming nine each.  The figure of 172 seats is three short of the
full National Assembly complement of 175 seats.  The three remaining
seats were not contested during the election because of the high
levels of violence that have taken place in them since the October
presidential poll.  Elections in these constituencies are to be held
at a later date.

All three of the postponed constituencies lie in the Gagnoa region,
stronghold of the IFP, and as a result of the postponements, IFP
leader Laurent Gbagbo was effectively prevented from taking part in
the elections.  According to government sources, the violence in
Gagnoa has resulted in dozens of deaths and thousands of displaced
persons.  Of the four constituencies within Gagnoa, the only one
deemed by the government to be stable enough for elections to take
place was, by coincidence, the only one in which the PDCI-RDA was
victorious in the 1990 parliamentary elections.

However, the government's success was not repeated there this time
round and the seat was won by the IFP.  Gbagbo, whose IFP joined the
RDR in a boycott of the presidential elections, described
postponements in the other constituencies as a cynical move to
prevent him from being present in the National Assembly when the
Speaker was elected.  In rejecting these claims, Interior Minister
Emile Bombet said that some 18.6% of Gagnoa voters had fled the
region as a result of the violence and, as such, were unable to vote
until peace returned there.  Be that as it may, weight was added to
the allegations of a government conspiracy against leading opposition
members by the earlier decision, by the Constitutional Council, not
to allow RDR secretary, Djeny Kobina, to stand as a candidate in the
elections.

Just days before the elections were due to take place, Kobina was
denied candidacy by the Interior Ministry on the grounds that his
parents were Ghanaian and that he could not produce a certificate of
Ivorian citizenship.  Despite his claims that the government had
deliberately lost his citizenship paperwork in an attempt to throw
the opposition into disarray, the Court upheld the government
decision and Kobina was barred from standing.  This was a similar
move to that which was used to prevent Alassane Ouattara from
standing as RDR presidential candidate against Bedie.  It was that
decision that led to the violence in Gagnoa and other regions.

Possible manipulations aside, the opposition parties were further
hindered by their inability to decide on joint candidates for the
parliamentary poll.  This left many seats with both an IFP and an RDR
candidate in the contest.  To what degree this split the opposition
vote is not clear, but it may well have had a bearing on the final
results.

Within those results, initial analysis would tend to suggest that
both the opposition parties' support remains localized.  The RDR
appears to be essentially entrenched in the north while the IFP is
best established in the center-west region of the Adzope enclave,
which includes Gagnoa.  The PDCI-RDA took all seats in the western
and south-western regions and were predominant in the central region.

Of the five PDCI ministers that stood for election only one, Alphonse
Djedje Mady, was defeated.  Francis Wodie, leader of the Ivorian
Workers Party and sole opponent of Bedie in the presidential poll,
was defeated by the PDCI candidate in the Cocody electoral district
of Abidjan.

Voting was said, by government sources, to have taken place with few
incidents, although independent reports on levels of fraud and/or
violence have, at the time of writing,  yet to be released.  It
cannot be ruled out, however, that in the light of the results,  the
opposition stance toward the government will harden and with that
will come increased , if generally localized, levels of violence.
Should that prove to be the case, a security clampdown may well
result.

Meanwhile, the December 17 municipal elections look set to be
postponed as a result of insufficient time in which to process
candidacies.

GABON
POLITICS

After 28 years as the ruling party, President Omar Bongo's Gabonese
Democratic Party (PDG) look to be increasingly at risk of losing
control of government in the forthcoming March legislative elections.

Much will now depend on whether Bongo and his party make good on
their stated commitment to ensure free and fair elections or follow
the same path as in 1990 when, in the country's first multi-party
elections, the opposition were denied victory by vote rigging and
fraud.  The ensuing hostilities between government and opposition
resulted in several changes to the country's political structure.

The Movement of National Recovery (MORENA), led by Mba Abessole and,
in 1990, the major threat to Bongo and the PDG, split into several
factions following differences of opinion over how to deal with
Bongo's devious behavior.  Abessole carried the bulk of MORENA's
support with him to his new National Assemblage of Woodcutters (RNB)
party.  The remainder followed two other factions known as MORENA and
MORENA-Originel.

Aside from the opposition split, the 1990 result also gave rise to a
series of measures aimed at reducing the Bongo's power.  Most
important of these was the move toward a new constitution that would
enshrine the necessary checks and balances to avoid a rerun of the
1990 electoral fraud.  Despite apparent agreement between the
government and opposition over the so-called Paris Accord, Bongo
continued to dispute opposition claims that the National Assembly was
the country's de facto government until the new Senate, provided for
under the French-brokered agreement, came into being.

Bongo lost his case before the Constitutional Court in mid-1995.  The
Court's decision, however, prevented the National Assembly from
ratifying the Paris Accord without a referendum.  This was duly held
and resulted in a 95% vote for ratification.  A further result of the
Court's ruling was the extension of the current period of office of
the National Assembly by six months, putting the date of elections
back until March 1996.

Going in to these elections, the PDG has 66 seats in the 120 seat
National Assembly.  The opposition Gabonese Progress Party (PGP),
headed by Pierre-Louis Agondjo-Okawe, has 19 seats and the RNB, 17.
The remainder are taken up by minority opposition parties.

Despite the RNB's apparent position of third, it must be remembered
that the results of the 1990 elections that determined this pattern
are widely believed to bear little resemblance to the voting that
actually took place.  The fact that the socialist and secular PGP
holds the main opposition position is more to do with the PDG
tampering less with its voting figures than a genuine lead over the
RNB.

The PGP draws most of its support from the Myere ethnic group and
urban workers.  Since the 1990 elections, the Myere have become less
important electorally as high levels of urbanization have left them
as minority groupings.  In addition, many of the urban workers upon
whom the PGP has depended for support are from the Nbazi ethnic
group.  There is some evidence from the 1993 presidential elections
that this group have undergone a shift in support toward Bongo.
Although the figures for the presidential election, in which Abessole
did not take part and Bongo was returned to office, are probably as
unreliable as those of the 1990 elections, the fact that Agondjo
received little support as a presidential candidate tend to support
the theory that the PGP can no longer rely as heavily on the urban
worker vote.

Far more worrying for the PDG than the loss of support for the PGP is
the fact that much of the shift toward urban areas has been
undertaken by the Fang ethnic group which broadly supports Abessole
and the RNB.  The broad conclusion to be drawn from these factors
would tend toward being that, provided the March elections are free
from the shenanigans of 1990, the RNB should see a considerable rise
in its support, possibly even enough to force the PDG in to a
position of minority within the National Assembly.  In addition to
the Fang, the RNB also draws support from the Bapunu ethnic group and
the urban middle classes.  Unlike the PGP, whose support is largely
regional and based around Port Gentil, the RNB is nationally
organized.

The PDG's problems are compounded by the possibility of an alliance
between the RNB and Bongo's son, Ali.  Although he has not openly
criticized his father, Ali Bongo, is known to be in favor of seeing
fair elections this time round and would like to see a shedding of
the old style PDG loyalists in favor of younger technocrats.  Ali
held discussions with Abessole in the aftermath of the 1993
presidential elections and it is believed that he is not averse to
seeing his father replaced if such an event would further his own
ambitions.

Further important dimensions to Gabonese politics come in the form of
the military and the (former colonial) French government.  Both these
actors have given strong support to Bongo in the past.  While the
French government has been critical of the lack of democracy in the
country, it was not above sending military support to the President
to help in the putting down of widespread demonstrations against the
regime in 1990.  France also trains and equips the Presidential Guard
(PG) which has been responsible for violent repression of the
opposition culminating in the destruction of Abessole' home and the
MORENA radio station Liberte in late 1994.

Despite former French President Mitterrand announcing a policy of
tying development aid to democratization in 1990, no French
government has yet implemented such a policy.  Relations between
Gabon and its former colonial power have improved considerably since
the May 1995 election of French President Jacques Chirac.  So far, it
is unclear to what degree the current French government is committed
to the Paris Accord brokered by its predecessor.

Coincidentally, Elf-Aquitaine, the oil company owned largely by the
French government continues to enjoy preferential treatment at the
hands of the Gabonese government.  In yet another coincidence, French
criticism of Bongo's administration has tended to become more muted
when rumors of the loss of Elf-Aquitaine's leases have surfaced.

Should the March elections suffer from the same irregularities as
their predecessors, it remains to be seen whether the French
government will turn a blind eye, or even exercise its moral
responsibility in aiding the Gabonese security forces in restoring
stability on the streets once more.  What is equally unclear,
however, is the degree to which the military would be prepared to
subdue the opposition as a matter of course.

On balance, the outlook for the PDG and Bongo is not good.  Attempts
by the regime to construct a more broadly-based government which
includes Fang members have done little to soften opposition desires
to rid the country of PDG rule.  If the results are again tampered
with, it is next to impossible, even with French help, to see how a
period of considerable political unrest could be avoided.

GABON
ECONOMY

Unfortunately for Bongo and the PDG, Gabon's economic position leaves
little room for maneuver.  The country suffers from an overly heavy
dependence on the oil sector and high levels of imported labor,
expertise and investment.  The falling price of oil since the mid
1980's coupled with excessive government spending has left the
country in a position in which it is heavily reliant on international
lenders such as the IMF.  Adjustment programs sponsored by the IMF
have met with little success in the past as attempts to implement
austerity measures have resulted in widespread popular protests.

The latest in a series of structural adjustment programs was
negotiated with the donor organization in 1994 following a
devaluation of the CFA franc.  The effect of the devaluation has been
to push prices up by some 40% since the beginning of 1994, but the
government's hands are tied in trying to offset this by wage
increases because of the terms of the agreements made with the IMF.
The problem of inflation as a result of devaluation is brought into
sharp focus by the fact that Gabon is dependent on imports for some
85% of its food needs.

In addition to the devaluation problem, siphoning funds off to
feather the nests of the ruling classes during the boom times of the
early 1980's has resulted in a crumbling infrastructure and growing
difficulties in supplying basic health, education and housing
services to the population.  These problems, in particular the
deteriorating road links needed to maintain the supply and export of
food and agricultural produce, have resulted in a large population
shift toward urban areas.  This has, in turn compounded the problems
already faced in urban centers and has given rise to unemployment
rates of some 12%.  This latter is of acute importance socially in a
country where the average wage earner supports ten people.

The one relatively bright spot for the economy is that the timber
industry is gaining ground as a result of Asian countries restricting
excessive logging and dangerous deforestation.  Wood and wood
products are second only to crude petroleum in terms of export
earnings.

1996 Budget
The cabinet recently adopted a budget of CFAfr817 billion for 1996.
This figure represents a 5% increase on the 1995 budget of CFAfr780
billion and conforms to the three year program signed with the IMF.
Given that inflation is currently running at an annualized 15% and
GDP growth is unlikely to exceed around 1.5%, it is difficult to see
how such a budget target can be met without considerable spending
cuts taking place.

Suspicion surrounded two major fires that took place at the Queen's
Palace and Finance Ministry in Antananarivo in mid-November.  The
fire at the Palace left the building razed to the ground, and the
loss of what was an historical landmark has been described as a
national tragedy.

Perhaps more immediately significant, however, are the rumors that
the Palace fire was set deliberately to divert attention from another
fire which started in offices within the Finance Ministry.  These
were not just any old offices, but the rooms which contained files on
tax and customs investigations, as well as highly sensitive cases of
embezzlement involving several well known figures.

Four of these are alleged to have been close associates of the
outgoing prime minister, Francisque Ravony, including the finance
minister in the first Ravony cabinet.  This was the time at which
Ravony was still very much involved in the business of "parallel
financing".  The subsequent row between Ravony and President Albert
Zafy  over an end to the practice led to the former's eventual
resignation.  Another alleged subject of the files was the former
President, Didier Ratsiraka.

The Finance Ministry issued a statement following the fire to the
effect that tax and customs files had not been damaged.  Rumors are
rife, however, that the most important of these documents have
disappeared.  Several senior luminaries in Antananarivo are said to
be breathing a collective sigh of relief.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who replaced Ravony
following the latter's defeat in a nationwide referendum on
presidential powers in October, announced his new cabinet on November
10.

Rakotovahiny kept many of the central figures of Ravony's Cabinet in
place in what he described as a Cabinet aimed at continuity and
reconciliation.  The full Cabinet is as follows:

Interior, Decentralization and Territorial Security - Charles Severin
(retained post);
Civil Service, Administrative Reform and Labor - Henri Rakotovololona
(retained post);
Budget, Finance and Planning - Jean-Claude Raherimanjato (not in any

MALI
POLITICS

The peace that descended in the north of Mali following the August
decision of the Azaouad (Arab) Islamic Front (FIAA) to unilaterally
end hostilities with the government appears to be holding.

The FIAA was the last of the Arab Tuareg groups to be involved in
fighting the government since hostilities between the two sides broke
out in 1990.  Estimates suggest that during the intervening period,
some 50,000 Mali citizens have fled the country and sought safety in
neighboring Algeria and Mauritania.  Most recent reports suggest that
these refugees are now returning to Mali in large numbers, some
20,000 alone in the first two weeks of November.

In response to the improving security situation in the country,
President Konare, has signaled that conditions for the implementation
of the agreements made as part of the National Pact signed between
the government and Tuareg groups in 1992 are now in place.  The
return of Mali's refugees was central to the national pact and now
that this process would appear to be taking place, Konare has been
commenting on the means by which the remainder of the pact might be
instituted.

In addition to the return of the refugees, the 1992 agreements
envisaged a large degree of decentralization of powers and the
forming of autonomous Tuareg regions in the north of the country.
According to Konare, however, the government has decided that, in
order to facilitate the formation of these regions and achieve the
goal of widespread devolution, provincial boundary changes will need
to be made.

Konare has also been at pains to point out that such decentralization
will not be a quick process and has urged that dialogue on the issue
be continued for some time to come.  In addition, Konare sees the
overriding priority at the present time to be the rebuilding of the
infrastructure in the north of the country and the resumption of
basic services that have been impossible to provide during the
conflict.

The potential problem within Konare's suggestion of redefined
boundaries is that the original National Pact made no mention of
them.  Konare's response to this has been to say that fresh
boundaries are central to the task of decentralization and that the
new regions will be delineated in such a way as to allow the people
to unite along ethnic, cultural and historical bases.  What Konare
also concedes, however, is that the line-drawing operation will not
be without a mind toward the economic consequences for the country as
a whole.

So far, the FIAA have made no comment on Konare's proposals, but
should the redefined boundaries be such that the new regions are
denied access to means of economic production that the Tuareg feel
are rightly theirs to operate, there is a definite potential for a
return to conflict.  Whether this potential becomes realized or not
will depend, to a large extent, on the attitude to the changes of the
Libyan regime of Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi.  It was Qhadafi, reportedly,
who was behind the FIAA's decision to cease hostilities and recent
visits to Konare by the Libyan security minister suggest that there
is a high level of cooperation between the Mali government and the
ideological mentors of the Tuareg rebels.  Provided that this
cooperation continues, there must be a reasonable chance that the
peace in Mali will hold.

MALI
ECONOMY

Despite being offset to some extent by the end of hostilities, the
return of so many refugees to Mali will undoubtedly put pressure on
the government's coffers.  This will be of particular importance as
Mali is halfway through an IMF/World Bank sponsored structural
adjustment program (SAP).

The SAP has already caused considerable anxiety in the country, which
resulted in anti-government demonstrations throughout 1995.  The
depth of feeling about the austerity measures that have been put in
place have percolated through to the National Assembly.  This was
underlined during the adoption of the 1996 budget at the beginning of
December.  At the beginning of the year, the budget for 1995 was
passed unopposed but with one abstention.  Eleven months on, the 1996
budget still passed, but was subject to seven No votes and eleven
abstentions.

Overall spending for the financial year to end 1997 was placed at CFA
Fr380.327 billion.  Revenues are projected at CFA Fr333.853 billion,
leaving a budget deficit of CFA Fr46.486 billion.  The deficit, down
from CFA Fr54.127 billion in 1995, is to be financed from external
assistance and the mobilization of domestic savings.  The government
points out that earnings projections now show a CFA Fr524 million
surplus in relation to the 1993-1997 financial program.

While encouraging, this relatively small figure will almost certainly
be swallowed up by the government's stated intentions of rebuilding
the north of the country.  Spending to offset the effects of the SAP
in areas such as health and education has already fallen from CFA
Fr13 billion in 1994/95 through CFA Fr10 billion in 1995/96 to CFA
Fr8 billion in 1996/97.  Given the added expenditure required to
ensure a successful transition to peace, the government's chances of
staying within its target deficit must be seen as slim.

MOZAMBIQUE
POLITICS

Hostile rhetoric and equally hostile actions have marked the
relationship between President Joaquim Chissano and Mozambique
National Resistance (Renamo) leader, Afonso Dhlakama, ever since the
former's victory in Mozambique's first multi-party elections in 1994.

Over the past few months, however, the situation has deteriorated
still further.  The gap between Mozambique's two main political
protagonists has widened to chasm proportions that make the outlook
for an already fragile peace continuing through 1996 less likely than
at any time since the end of the country's 16 year long civil war.

The chances of a return to an all out civil war remain slim because
of Renamo's lack of external funding or over-border base camps, but
there is a distinct possibility that Dhlakama is moving toward making
good on his February 1995 threat to split the country by establishing
Renamo control in the five central provinces in which the party won
electoral victory.

Mid-October saw Nobre Meque, district Administrator of Maringue in
Sofala province, abandon his office and the district capital after
reportedly being mistreated by Renamo members.  Meque was originally
nominated by Renamo and appointed by the government, but has
subsequently been accused by the former rebel group of collusion with
the ruling Frelimo party.  In addition to Meque, it has been reported
that several other Maringue district officials have also been forced
to flee.

Other reports, some of which have been supported by independent
verification, have surfaced of Frelimo officials being beaten and
arrested by Renamo members in Gorongosa district (also in Sofala
province) and Dombe.  The violence committed against these officials
suggests that at least some Renamo members have chosen to forego
continued political argument over the government's decision to place
Frelimo officials into previously Renamo-controlled areas in favor of
direct action to remove them.

If so, a deal of significance can be given to Dhlakama's recent
admission that there are indeed arms caches still hidden throughout
the country and that the process of demobilization of former rebels
remains incomplete.

Despite continuing to refute suggestions that Renamo is considering a
return to war, these latest admissions contradict earlier statements
by Dhlakama which denied the presence of hidden arms.  In dealing
with this contradiction, Dhlakama now says that he would like to see
the arms caches that do exist collected and destroyed.  Given that,
it would seem reasonable to assume that Dhlakama could institute such
a process, but there appears to be some confusion over who has
control of these loose weapons.

Dhlakama claims that they are caches that belonged to the former
Popular Forces for the Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM), but gives no
suggestion as to who is in control of them now.  The State
Information and Security Service (SISE), on the other hand, says that
they are in the control of Renamo units which are unwilling to give
them up.  Just who is telling the truth is unclear.  What does seem
clear, however, is that there are arms available and, increasingly,
there is the possibility that they may again see active service.
As if to raise the temperature still further, rumors of an alleged
coup attempt by former Renamo soldiers now serving in the Mozambique
Defense Armed Forces (FADM) were rife during November.  The rumors
were denied to have any substance by both Prime Minister Pascoal
Mucumbi and FADM General and former Renamo rebel, David Mongero.
According to Mongero, the FADM was concerned by the rumors and did
not want the image of former Renamo soldiers now serving with FADM to
be tarnished by suggestions that they would take part in any such
action.

For his part, Dhlakama went much further in his denial of an alleged
coup plot, accusing the government of putting the rumors about in
order to justify the security clampdown he says is taking place in
the country.  Much of the violence that has recently taken place is,
according to him, the result of provocation by members of the Frelimo
controlled Mozambique Police Force as opposed to being spontaneous
acts of aggression by Renamo supporters.  He does however, concede
that in his visits around the country he is constantly being asked
why, when Renamo won majorities in the central and northern provinces
of Nampula, Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Tete, the government has
insisted on putting Frelimo governors into office.

There is no suggestion on Dhlakama's part that the frustrations
caused by this situation have led Renamo members to switch from
political lobbying to direct action.  The fact that the question is
being asked, however, does underline the feelings amongst rank and
file Renamo members that they are being denied a voice in the
supposedly democratic system they expected in return for laying down
their weapons.

These feelings have been accentuated by the government's continued
refusal to allow nationwide local elections.  Despite the government
claiming, with some justification, that it has no money to hold such
elections, Renamo members suspect a thoroughly different motivation.
As far as Renamo and Dhlakama are concerned, the government is simply
plain scared to hold nationwide elections for fear of being badly
defeated by Renamo.

Given the startling success of Renamo in capturing 112 of the 250
legislative seats in the October 1994 polls, there would appear to be
some justification for this theory.  Renamo further sees the policy
of installing Frelimo officials in important provincial positions in
the disputed provinces as a means by which the government is
attempting to extend its influence prior to eventual local elections.
In this manner, goes the argument, the government hopes to limit the
damage done to Frelimo when the local elections do come.

How realistic this assessment is remains to be seen, but the
situation looks set to worsen following the government's decision to
withdraw the local election bills from parliament in response to what
it described as a "lack of consensus" within the National Assembly.
According to the announcement which accompanied the decision, the
Assembly will now establish a working committee which will, in
cooperation with the government, set new dates for the elections.

This does not mean, however, that the elections will necessarily now
take place simultaneously throughout the country as demanded by
Renamo.  The government has made clear its preference for a staggered
approach to the elections and is unlikely to permit deviation from
that.  In addition, the likelihood is that they will not now take
place as scheduled during 1996, leaving an even longer period before
frustrated Renamo supporters have the opportunity to test their
theory of a local government landslide.  Dhlakama has asked the
international community to give Mozambique financial help in order to
speed the electoral process along.

The success of such a plea will depend in large part on what happens
in the meantime.  If attacks on Frelimo officials continue, Chissano
has warned that there are (unidentified) voices within the government
that are calling for a tough line to be taken.  A possible descent to
a state of emergency cannot be ruled out.

Commonwealth Membership
Meanwhile, a fresh row has broken out between the government and
Renamo over Mozambique's admission to the Commonwealth.  Mozambique
was admitted as a "special case" to the organization in mid-November
despite being neither a former British colony, nor an anglophone
country.  Commonwealth secretary-general, Emeka Anyaoku, explained
the decision to accept Mozambique's application for membership when
he pointed out that the country has had associations with the
Commonwealth since 1975 when it joined in sanctions against the
minority white government of the then Rhodesia.

Reactions to Mozambique's admission were swift.  Renamo led the
condemnation on the grounds that it was not consulted over the
decision to apply.  According to Renamo member of parliament (MP)
Jafar Gulamo, given that Mozambique has no anglophone tradition the
country's admission posed a fundamental question and, as such, should
have been subject to wide public discussion and possibly a
referendum.

Gulamo went on to say that Renamo would, however, give its full
support to the formation of a lusophone (Portuguese-speaking)
commonwealth because the Portuguese language was one of the few
binding factors within an otherwise varied country.   He criticized
the former colonial power, somewhat unfairly, for its lack of
cooperation with Mozambique to date and called on the new Portuguese
government to do all in its power to neutralize the effects of the
new membership.

Opposition ire aside, Mozambique's membership of the Commonwealth
should bring much needed economic rewards, especially given that many
of its neighbors are former British colonies and, as such, already
long standing members.  In addition to advantages in terms of trade,
the country should also benefit from technical assistance through the
Commonwealth fund for technical cooperation.

MOZAMBIQUE
ECONOMY

Work has now begun on refurbishment of the Cabora Bassa hydroelectric
scheme in Mozambique.  The scheme, operated by a joint committee with
members from Portugal, South Africa and Mozambique, has now secured
the necessary funding from both committee members and the European
Community.  No date has yet been set for the completion of the work,
but when finished, the scheme is expected to produce some 2,000 MW
which will be supplied to countries throughout the southern African
region.

Meanwhile, higher import costs as a result of devaluation of the
metical have been blamed by the Mineral Resources Ministry for the
18% rise in fuel prices over the last quarter of 1995.  As a result
of the increases, the first since June 1995, diesel will cost
MM3,500/liter, paraffin MM2,690/liter and gasoline MM5750/liter.
News of the changes will come as a disappointment to the country's
industrial sector which, according to Industry Minister, Oldemiro
Baloi, is on line to outperform target growth for 1995 by some 1.5%.
The original estimate for the sector's growth has been revised from
2.5% to 4.0%.

Banking Sector
President Chissano inaugurated the Mozambique International Bank at
the beginning of November.  The bank has an initial capital of US$10
million and shareholders include Portugal's Banco Comercial Portugues
- Banco Portugues do Atlantico group with 50%, the Mozambican
government with 32.5% and the Mozambican Insurance Enterprise with
12.5%.  The remaining 5% is taken up by the Community Development
Fund.

The new bank will have its headquarters in Maputo and will open two
branches, one in the capital and one in the city of Beira -
incidentally in Sofala province.  Former Prime Minister, Mario
Machungo is the bank's chairman.

TANZANIA
POLITICS

Tanzania's first multi-party presidential elections finally came to a
close on November 19 with the reruns of the earlier faulty elections
in Dar es Salaam.  Opposition attempts to have the entire electoral
process nationwide declared null and void were rejected by the High
Court and in a result which came as no surprise to anyone, Benjamin
Mkapa of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) was deemed to have won
the presidency with 61.8% of the valid votes cast.

Prior to the Dar es Salaam polls, nearly all opposition parties
declared a boycott in response to the elections throughout the
remainder of the country, which are now widely accepted as having
been riven by fraud.  This boycott was subsequently declared illegal
by the National Electoral Commission on the grounds that the
opposition candidates could not boycott elections in 3% of their
constituencies after having competed in the remaining 97%.

Be that as it may, opposition leaders and parties went on to boycott
the new parliament and the inauguration of the new president.  So
strong were the indications of widespread vote tampering that many
foreign diplomats joined the opposition in failing to attend the
inauguration ceremony.

While individual diplomats may have succeeded in sending a message of
discontent over the proceedings to the CCM, the community of
international donors at large has not taken any action against the
ruling party's apparent willingness to cheat in order to protect its
30-year long reign in power.

A joint statement issued by Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany,
Ireland, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the USA and UK following the
election results said that the donors believed that the result was in
line with the wishes of the people of Tanzania.  Given the sheer
amount of substantial evidence suggesting that the result bore
little, if any, resemblance to the actual voting that took place, it
is difficult to determine how these countries can be sure of such an
assertion.

Equally ineffectual was the statement released by the UN, which
provided the umbrella under which some 450 observers oversaw the
elections.  The organization recommended to the authorities that they
"correct anomalies" that had been found to be present.

It would be unfair in the extreme to suggest that international donor
and observer countries have an easy task in these situations.  The
end of the one party state is proving problematic throughout
sub-Saharan Africa.  It is questionable, however, whether it makes
long-term sense for those who promote democracy then to abdicate the
responsibility they have taken on.

The message that appears to be being sent to African countries in the
throes of forming democratic systems is that provided they "go
through the motions" of a democratic election, whether or not it is
actually democratic doesn't really matter.  This is a dangerous
message in a continent where the hope and belief in democracy is so
young and fragile.

The eventual outcome of smiling ruefully as if at some wayward
youngster is more likely to be the death of democracy in Africa than
its promotion.  Too many countries teeter on the brink of a return to
civil war for the international community to blithely disregard the
undermining of democracy.  If democracy is perceived to be a sham,
what realistic alternative is there for former rebel groups such as
Mozambique's Renamo, or Angola's Unita, other than a return to arms?

So far, Tanzania's international donors, who provide some 70% of the
country's national budget, have given little indication as to any
financial penalties that may ensue from the election irregularities.
The only government yet to break the silence has been the Dutch.
They have decided to resume balance of payments support suspended as
a result of CCM corruption in 1994.  Another resounding victory for
democracy.

The New Government
To some extent, all this is now academic.  Mkapa and the CCM are in
office for the next five years.  Shortly after his inauguration on
November 23, the new president announced that, given the CCM's
overwhelming victory in the general elections, he saw no requirement
to include members of the opposition in his government.

In line with this and his earlier pledge to slim down the Cabinet
from 29 to 22 ministers by merging some ministries, the new Cabinet
was announced at the end of November.

The vice-president is Omar Ali Juma and the Prime Minister, Frederick
Sumaye.

Under the President's office there are two Ministers of State, Mateo
Karesi and Danile Yona, the latter of which is responsible for
planning.

The vice president's office has one Minister of State, Mohammed Seif
Khatib and the Prime Minister's office has two, Bakari Mbonde and
Juma Mkangaa.  The remaining Ministers are as follows:

Home Affairs - Ali Amer Mohammed; Finance - Simon Mbilinyi (former
principal secretary to the Ministry of Finance);  Industries and
Trade - Abdalla Kigoda;  Communications and Transport - William
Kusila;  Agriculture and Cooperatives - Paul Kimiti; Health - Zakia

Anna Abdalla (former Minister of State in the vice-president's
office); Labor and Youth Development - Sebastian Kinyondo; Community
Development and Women's Affairs - Mary Nagu; Justice and

(a former deputy minister).

TOGO
POLITICS

The opposition Action Committee for Renewal (CAR) reacted with dismay
to Prime Minister Edem Kodjo's early December reshuffle.  The CAR's
Yao Agboyibo described the reshuffle, in which the number of cabinet
ministers was increased from 21 to 23,as a massive entrance into
government of the barons of the country's former sole ruling party,
the Rally of the Togolese People.

Agboyibo went on to say that the reshuffle came at a particularly
difficult time as the National Assembly is set to begin debates on
the formation of a National Electoral Commission and Constitutional
Court.

It would appear that, in making the cabinet changes, Kodjo has caved
in to pressure from President Gnassingbe Eyadema to install as many
of his cronies as possible prior to the formation of bodies that will
oversee the development of democracy in the country.  The new cabinet
is as follows:

Foreign Affairs and Cooperation - Barry Moussa Barque;

UGANDA
POLITICS

Despite reports of talks between President Yoweri Museveni and Libyan
leader, Mu'ammar al-Qhadafi, on ending the dispute between Uganda and
neighboring Sudan, tension around the border region looks to be
returning to the levels experienced at the end of 1994.  This latest
worsening of relations began in early November when, according to the
Sudanese government, Ugandan troops took part in a military attack on
the southern border areas in collusion with the Sudanese rebel
organization, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).

Sudan has made similar claims in the past, which have been matched in
frequency by Ugandan accusations of cross-border attacks into its
territory by the Sudan-based rebel forces of Joseph Kony's Lord
Resistance Army (LRA).  The situation plunged to alarming depths at
the end of 1994 when Sudanese aircraft bombed a village in the north
of Uganda.  Qhadafi intervened at that time as well, and the
so-called Tripoli Declaration was signed by both governments.  Under
the terms of the declaration, both countries agreed to stop aiding
the other's rebel forces, but the agreement fell apart following a
further massacre inside the Ugandan border by soldiers of the LRA.
Although Sudan denied involvement, Museveni unilaterally broke off
diplomatic relations.

Since the two countries pulled back from the brink of war, Sudanese
government forces' have experienced considerable successes in
advancing into areas formerly controlled by the SPLA and its splinter
group, The South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM).  These Sudanese
advances have virtually wiped out the SSIM, but completing the
mopping up operation against the SPLA is proving more difficult than
Sudan's President Omar Beshir would like.  Ending Sudan's civil war
in the south was one of Beshir's pledges when he ousted the former
Sudanese government in a coup in 1989.  His signal failure to do so
has caused considerable political pressure on him at home and he
would dearly love to see a resolution to the problem.

In the SPLA, the Sudanese forces have met an enemy that, despite
being overwhelming outnumbered and having suffered some stinging
defeats over the past two years, refuses to lie down and die.  The
reason the SPLA has been able to string things out so long, according
to Sudan, is that Uganda is providing the rebels with arms and
technical assistance.

According to Sudan, the latest attacks inside its territory were
carried out by the Fourth Ugandan Division aided by tank crews from
Eritrea, which President Museveni requested during Eritrean
President, Isayas Aferwerki's, recent visit to Uganda.  Eritrea broke
off diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1994 after accusing the Sudan
regime of training Islamic fundamentalists to destabilize the
country. The evidence of Ugandan and Eritrean involvement in the
latest attacks is said to have come from prisoners captured by
Sudanese forces. Museveni, however, denies the involvement of Ugandan
troops and maintains that Ugandan interest in the Sudan's civil war
is limited to observation only

Ominously, President Beshir has said that having overcome this latest
attack by the SPLA/Ugandan forces, the Sudanese army is now intent on
"repaying the visit of those who visited".  A further deterioration
in the situation cannot be ruled out.

ZAIRE
POLITICS

A date for the elections that will bring to an end the country's five
years of transitional government is still not set.  It would now
appear, however, that such elections may be held sooner than was
expected after the government's August decision to extend the period
of transition by a further two years.

That decision caused widespread dismay among opponents of President
Sese Mobutu who want to see a return to the premiership of Etienne
Tshisekedi, the prime minister ditched by Mobutu in 1994.  In
response to the decision members of the Sacred Union of the Radical
Opposition and Allies (SUR), which has Tshisekedi at its head,
carried out a series of ghost-town operations in the country aimed at
forcing a government rethink.

Such actions appear to have borne fruit.  The Electoral Commission
responsible for the organization of the elections was presented to
the Transitional Parliament at the end of November.  The Commission
consists of 44 members, half of whom are drawn from the Political
Forces of the Enclave (FPC) which supports Mobutu and the remaining
half from SUR.  According to government sources, the Commission would
have been ready for presentation earlier had it not been for the SUR
squabbling over who should sit on it.  The SUR is divided into two
main factions, that which supports a return of Tshisekedi and that
which supports Frederic Kibassa-Maliba.

Now that the Commission is in place, there is a reasonable chance
that the elections, originally scheduled for July 1995, will take
place within the two year extension period.  This view is supported
by the allocation of funds to do just that in the 1996 draft budget.

Mobutu claims to see this as good news.  According to him, he is the
only politician in Zaire who has been pressing for early elections.
Those within the SUR that have cast him as a dictator who is
deliberately stalling the path toward democracy are apparently
misguided.  Nothing could be further from the truth in fact.  Mobutu
welcomes the prospect of international observers for the elections
and believes that it is the opposition, not he, that is afraid of the
eventual outcome of the polls.  Just how long this new-found
enthusiasm will last remains to be seen, but Mobutu is doubtless
aware that the divisions within the opposition do, indeed, enhance
the likelihood of him retaining power after the elections.

Meanwhile, Zaire's budget estimates for 1996 were submitted to the
transitional parliament in mid-November.  The draft projects a
balanced budget of Zz5,700 billion.  To achieve the 70% rise in
revenue in real terms to meet the budget target, Zz1,428 billion
would be raised by an 88% increase in customs and excise duties and a
further Zz1,350.4 billion by way of a 107% hike in local taxes.  Oil
revenue is expected to grow by 53% to Zz698.2 billion and earnings
from the General Quarries and Mines and Bakwanga Mines Companies is
expected to reach ZZ678.3 billion despite a slowdown in diamond
production.

Expenditure is set to rise by 54% in real terms.  Interestingly, the
expenditure figures include a Zz606.9 billion package for the holding
of elections.  This is expected to be supplemented by external
assistance.  Other major expenditures within the draft budget include
Zz178.1 billion in capital expenditure and Zz1,178.1 billion in
public debt payments.

JANUARY 1996

BANGLADESH
POLITICS

Prime Minister Zia finally succumbed to the pressure of the
opposition parties and handed in her government's resignation on
November 24.  The battle with the opposition parties - Awami League,
Jatiya and Jamaat-e-Islami - began in December 1994 when, led by the
Awami League, they refused to participate in a by-election, accusing
the government of blatant corruption, of winning the 1991 general
election by fraud and of perpetrating the same practice in an earlier
by-election in which the ruling Bangladesh National Party (BNP) was
victorious in a known Awami League stronghold.  All 142 opposition
members then withdrew from parliament and started a campaign of
"rolling" strikes or hartal in order to force the government's
resignation, the installation of a neutral caretaker government, and
the calling of a fresh general election.

But Prime Minister Zia has not gone down without fighting.  Despite
the economic disruption, and violence, of the hartals, she has kept
her government in office with only her own 138 BNP party members
sitting in parliament.  As a result, although she has finally been
forced to call an early general election, she has still managed to
serve out almost all of her term of office which was due to end in
March of this year anyway.  Moreover, although President Biswas
accepted her government's resignation he has not given way to
opposition demands for a caretaker prime minister.  Instead he has
asked Ms. Zia to stay on as caretaker through to the new election.

The end game in the struggle between government and opposition began
in late September when the hartal program was stepped up with a call
for a 48-hour strike on October 7 in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong,
Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet, to be followed by a four-day
nationwide shutdown from October 16.  There was the usual violence.
At least one person was killed and more than 40 injured in the
general strike.

In an attempt to regain the initiative, Prime Minister Zia carried
out a minor reshuffle of her cabinet on October 18.  She then
announced by-elections for all 145 vacant opposition seats in
parliament to be held on December 15 and invited the opposition
parties to demonstrate their commitment to democracy by contesting
for their own seats.

The opposition response was to call for a countrywide blockade of
road, rail and water transport on November 6 to be followed by a
12-hour general strike across the country on six consecutive days
from November 11.

The transportation blockade brought the country to a virtual
standstill and at least 200 people, police and demonstrators, were
injured in numerous clashes in which the police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets.  The security situation deteriorated further when the
general strike began on November 11.  As far as is known there were
no fatalities.  However a number of grenades and home made bombs were
thrown and at least 50 people were injured, including the leader of
the Awami League, Motia Chowdhury and his wife.

Presumably recognizing that any attempt to hold by-elections for the
opposition seats would almost certainly even more widespread
violence, with the danger that security could break down completely,
Prime Minister Zia handed in her resignation saying she looked
forward to free and fair elections in which the opposition parties
would play a full part.

She argued that the whole electoral process had been cleaned up under
her administration.  The election laws have been extensively amended
and the electoral Commission strengthened to prevent any government
or other force from illegally influencing the election process.  In
addition, she said, her government had made provision to set up a
committee of judges for immediate arbitration if a party, individual,
or candidate is accused of violating the election law or rules.  New
electoral lists has been formulated to check rigging and identity
cards are to be used to verify the registration of voters.

The prime minister also stressed the difference between the
constitutional governance of the country at the last general election
and this.  In 1990, Bangladesh had an executive presidency under
which an unelected person could be appointed vice-president.  Under
such circumstances it was within the realms of possibility for a
person with no popular mandate to become the executive head of state.
Now, as a result of the 12th amendment to the constitution approved
by parliament and referendum in 1991, the executive presidency had
been replaced by a parliamentary system in which the prime minister
was head of government and only an elected member of parliament could
occupy the post of prime minister.

The fundamental difference between her and the opposition parties,
she claimed, was that she supported the current system of governance,
while they wanted to return to the executive presidency system, an
impossibility under the current constitution.

The response of the opposition parties to all this is not yet known.
Neither is the election date.  Both are critical.  The opposition
parties will clearly be cheered by the fact that the prime minister
has finally caved in, but will still be anxious that she remains head
of government and, in their view, still able to exercise a malign
role in the election process.  With that in mind they will be looking
for the election to be held sooner rather than later.  Prime Minister
Zia on the other hand will probably want to delay as long as
possible.

At the moment the outcome is impossible to predict, but we would not
be surprised if President Zip's BNP still emerged as the largest
party in the new parliament.

Expulsions
Dhaka has responded angrily to Pakistan's November expulsion of
Bangla speakers to Bangladesh, rejecting Islamabad's claim that they
are Bangladeshi nationals.  The Pakistani move hits at the heart of a
long-running sore in Bangladeshi-Pakistani relations - the status of
the Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh.

Under an agreement made in 1974, Pakistan undertook to accept as
Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims who were still resident
in the former East Pakistan and who did not accept the newly
established Bangladesh as their country.  Under the agreement
Pakistan did allow an initial  150,000 Biharis, who had blood
relations in Pakistan, to immigrate.  However, no Bihari Muslims have
been allowed into Pakistan since 1974, leaving some 250,000 stranded
in Bangladesh.

During an official visit to Pakistan in April last year, Prime
Minister Zia reminded her hosts of the 1974 commitment.  In addition,
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds
for the rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis, asked Pakistan to let
the stranded Biharis come back.  This was probably the background to
the arrival of some 700 Bangladeshi immigrants in Pakistan in
October.

However, these people were immediately ejected.  Then, on October 31,
Pakistani interior minister, Nasirullah Babar, told the National
Assembly that the government intended to "throw out" all illegal
immigrants.  As for the OIC's appeal to take back the stranded
Biharis, he said "Let the Arabs take the Biharis" as there is plenty
of land to settle them in the UAE, Iraq or elsewhere in West Asia.

The reasons for Pakistan's reluctance to accept any more Bihari
Muslims and its ejection of those already resident in the country
probably have far more to do with the troubles in Karachi and Sind
province generally than with fears of overpopulation.  A large number
of the Bangla-speaking Pakistanis are sympathetic to the Mohajir
Qaumi Movement (MQM) in urban Sind.  Getting rid of them reduces the
size of the MQM's support base.

BANGLADESH
ECONOMY

Although Prime Minister Zia has done her best to pump up an economic
success story, an election could hardly have come at a less
propitious time in economic terms.  While, the free-market policy she
launched four years ago did have some striking early successes, it
has run out of steam of late, forcing a reversal of many of the
original policy initiatives.

Thus, while the prime minister boasted in October last that the GDP
per head had risen from US$170 in 1991 to some US$236 in the current
financial year, she omitted to mention that his had been undermined
by a huge jump in the inflation rate from 1.8% in 1993/94 to over 6%
currently.  Moreover, the blanket inflation figure masks even greater
rises in prices of essential commodities, which hit harder on the
poor, and the poor make up the greater part of the population.

One major cause of the sharp rise in inflation has been an enormous
jump in the money supply as a direct result of the free market
policy, or, rather, its inadequate management.

When the free market program was instituted, interest rates were cut,
the system of Letter of Credit margins for imports was withdrawn, and
the maximum ceiling on project loans was abolished.  The overall aim
of these measures was to encourage investment, by making borrowing
cheaper, which would in turn create new large employment
opportunities.  The overall effect would be to bring a new dynamism
into the economy.

Between June 1991 and April 1994, the bank rate was reduced nine
times, from 9.75% to 5.5%.  Over the same period the interest rate on
savings accounts, which ranged between 8% and 11.5%, was reduced to
4.5%.  The interest rate on fixed deposits, which ranged between 10%
and 13.75%, was reduced to 5%.

The package was well received by the international community.  The
mobilization of domestic resources was increased, the foreign
exchange rate stabilized, foreign exchange reserves increased, the
deficit in foreign transactions reduced, and domestic savings
increased.  Against this background the annual GDP growth averaged
4.4% between 1991/92 and 1993/94 while the inflation rate was brought
down from 9% to under 2%.

But now things have started to go wrong.  The government was right
that lower interest rates would encourage borrowing.  The problem is
it had no means of exercising control over how the borrowed money was
to be used.  Over the four years of the economic plan BT145 billion
has been withdrawn from the country's banks and financial
institutions in the form of loans.  In 1994/95 alone these loans
amounted to BT85 billion.

However, neither the government nor the central bank has any reliable
means of measuring where this money has gone.  For example, imports
have risen from Bt135 billion in 1991/92 to Bt270 billion in 1994/95,
but the central bank has virtually no information on the pattern of
this growth.  It does not know which sectors of the economy are
responsible for the increase or why. The effects, however, are clear
- foreign exchange reserves fell by US$900 million in the first four
months of the current financial year.

What is known is that the growth in the money supply - up from 10% to
18% over the four year period - has outstripped the increase in the
volume of trade and investment.  The obvious conclusion is that the
money taken in loans from the banks has been spent on consumption
goods rather than invested in the productive sectors of the economy.

Now, in order to cut back on the money supply and rein in inflation,
almost all the free-market reforms have been reversed.  The currency
has been devalued twice, the interbank rate raised three times from
4.5% to 6.5% with consequent rises in the interest rates on savings
accounts and fixed deposits in banks, a 25% margin rate for Letters
of Credit has been reimposed, and a maximum loan limit of Bt250
million has been imposed on all large industrial projects.

The problem for the central bank is that a strategy of using interest
rates alone to solve the crisis may not be enough.  Up to 40% of the
bank loans already made must be regarded as non-performing or lost.
On top of that the upcoming general election will inevitably mean an
increase in spending, further boosting the money supply and inflation
rate.

INDIA
POLITICS

At a federal level, the political classes are now entirely consumed
with the upcoming general election to the lower house of parliament,
the Lok Sabha, with the Bharaiya Janata Party (BJP), in particular
confident that it can make major inroads into Congress Party support.
The BJP formally re-elected L.K. Advani as its leader for a second
successive term on October 21 last.  Advani was unopposed.

The term of the present parliament expires on July 8, which makes
June the last possible month for the election.  At the time of
writing no election date has been fixed, but it appears that most the
opposition parties - the BJP, communist Party of India (CPI),
communist Party of India - Marxist (CPI-M), Janata Dal and the Samata
Party - favor a date in February, immediately after the fasting month
of Ramadan, with elections for some assemblies to be completed by
March 10.  However, with its prospects uncertain, Congress (I) wants
to hold out as long as possible.  With that in mind, an election
sometime in the second half of April looks the most likely outcome.

Although the parties differ on the date of the election, there is an
apparent consensus for a single-day poll in states and for polls for
the federal parliament to be held over a maximum of three days.

Jammu and Kashmir
The government's elections plans have been thrown into dome disarray
by the decision of the Electoral commission on November 10 not to go
ahead with elections in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir.

President's rule in the state was due to expire on January 17.  It
was a principal part of the government's overall strategy to have
elections held in the state and a new state government installed well
before then.  It was a multi-target strategy.  First, the holding of
the elections would have demonstrated, both at home and abroad, that
the central government was sufficiently on top of the security
situation to conduct the elections.  Second, it would have undermined
growing international pressure on India by providing a democratically
elected state government that was not committed to full independence
or absorption by Pakistan.  Third, it would have provided a
tremendous boost to the government's authority just ahead of the
federal elections.

Despite the continuing widespread violence and terrorism in the
state, hopes that an election would be held were raised on October 25
when the National Conference party (NC), which formed the state
government until President's rule was imposed on January 19, 1990,
held its first public meeting for six years.  Over 2,000 people
turned up for the meeting which was held in the apple township of
Sopore, until recently a militant stronghold.

Prime Minister Rao immediately initiated talks with the NC leader and
former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, with
the aim of securing his agreement to the government's election and
devolution plans.  However, the talks broke down on November 2, with
Farooq sticking to his demand for a return to pre-1953 status for the
state.  This conferred residuary sovereignty on Jammu and Kashmir in
respect of all matters except defense, foreign affairs and
communications.  Rao's devolution package, on the other hand,
specifies that the status of the state should be worked out after the
election in consultation with the election state parliament.

After the talks deadlock, Dr. Farooq said the NC would boycott the
"the election farce", With that he put himself in line with virtually
every other political party in India, both inside and outside Jammu
and Kashmir, except Congress (I).  Despite this near unanimous
opposition and a frightening security situation, Prime Minister Rao
was determined to press ahead and announced that elections would be
held in the state in mid-December.

He appeared not to have reckoned on the three-man Electoral
Commission, however.  After visiting the state, the Commission
unanimously declared that "the sum total of factors in the state of
Jammu and Kashmir are not consistent with the conduct of a fair and
free election".  Rao had gambled, and lost.

This leaves the government with precious little room for maneuver in
the state.  The daily murder toll is at alarming proportions in the
border areas; Pakistan has succeeded in internationalizing the issue
with India coming under increasing foreign criticism for its handling
of the situation and its alleged abuses of human rights; and, last
but not least, there is now increasingly hard evidence of direct
Pakistani involvement in the fighting.  This is exactly the mix that
brought Pakistan and India to war in 1965 and 1971.

In the meantime, the government has embarked on the massive task of
building a barbed wire security fence along its entire border with
Pakistan.  The fence has already been completed in the Punjab and the
fencing of the 1,035 kilometer border between Rajasthan state and
Pakistan  is planned to be completed by March 1996.  Fencing of the
190-kilometer Kashmir border will then be undertaken.  According to
the government, the border fence in the Punjab has already been
effective in deterring infiltrators.

Despite the precarious security situation in the state, the federal
government claims that the agricultural and allied sectors in Jammu
and Kashmir have recorded strong growth over the past six years.
According to official figures, foodgrain production rose to 1.95
million tonnes during 1994 from 1.45 million tonnes in 1991/92.  Over
the same period, rice production in the state increased from 550,000
tonnes in 1991/92 to 807,000 tonnes; and fertilizer production from
68,000 tonnes to 73,000 tonnes.   Fruit production also rose during
the period.  Apple production has risen from 79,200 tonnes to 1,900
tonnes, while the area under apple orchards has expanded from 46,000
hectares  in 1974/75 to 83,000 hectares in 1993/94.  The per hectare
yield of applies, the main fruit grown in the Kashmir Valley, has
risen from 1.12 tonnes in 1974-75 to 10.04 tonnes in 1993-94.

In addition, the state is to have its first-ever industrial growth
center, to be located in Ompura.  Also, the Small Scale Industries
Institute relocated from Srinagar to Jammu due to militancy is to be
moved back to Srinagar.

Civil Disorder
Civil disorder, frequently descending to the level of political
terrorism, continue to make parts of India, particularly in the
north, extremely dangerous places in which to live.  On October 31, a
mass demonstration by Sikhs in the capital, New Delhi, resulted in
some 200 arrests.  The demonstration was called to protest against
the federal government's apparent inaction in punishing anyone of
significance for inciting the riots against Sikhs in 1984, following
the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh guard.

In particular, the demonstrators demanded the arrest of the Congress
(I) member of parliament from Outer Delhi, Sajjan Kumar, and former
federal minister H.K.L. Bhagat, for their alleged roles in the riots.
On November 10, a bomb blast in the capital injured an estimated 19
people.

On November 13, Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East-West
Airlines, India's first private carrier, was shot dead by
unidentified persons in Bombay.   on November 13.  Wahid was shot
outside his office and was dead on arrival at hospital.  He started
the airline in 1992.

As for violence elsewhere in the country:

Manipur
In November, suspected activists of the underground People's
Liberation Army (PLA) shot dead a the district manage of the
government's Food Corporation of India in the state capital, Imphal.
After his death, police found a threatening letter in his office from
the Revolutionary People's Front, the political wing of the PLA for
not paying Ir500,000 to the group.

Tripura
Insurgents, believed to belong to the National Liberation Front of
Tripura (NLFT) killed six people in separate incidents in the first
two days of October.  On October 3, four policemen were killed in an
ambush.  On October 4, five people, including three members of the
ruling CPI-M were killed in separate incidents and at the end of the
month there were three more murders in separate incidents.

However, in November, the government claimed that "all 157 rebels of
an another, unnamed, "military movement" surrendered to the
authorities in after an appeal from the state government.  The
rebels, led by a Captain Murari Mohant Saha, turned in their weapons
and ammunition.

Gujarat
There were violent demonstrations in Gujarat in early October
following a split in the BJP when Shankar Sinh Vaghela, the leader of
a dissident BJP faction allied himself and 48 of his supporters with
Madhya Pradesh.  More than 5,000 BJP activists, reportedly led by BJP
parliament member A.K. Patel and state Health Minister Nalin Patel,
attacked the building where the dissidents were staying, kidnapping
one of them.

Assam
Bodo tribal militants, operating under the banners of the Bodo
Security Force (BSF) and the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA)
killed at least 22 people - security personnel and civilians -  in
October and November in sporadic attacks.

Uttar Pradesh.
Governance in the state was thrown into chaos in October, just ahead
of municipal elections scheduled for November, when the BJP withdrew
its support for the four-and-a-half month old Bahujan Samaj Party
government.  The BJP move appeared to have been prompted by the
murder of its leader in the state, Babu Ram Gupta, by unknown
assailants in Muzaffarnagar on October 8.

The withdrawal of the BJP forced the resignation of the state's chief
minister, Ms Mayawati, on October 18.  With no party in the state
able to command a majority, president's rule was imposed on October
18.

As usual, violence ensued.  On October 24, about 34 people suffered
minor injures when a bomb exploded at a market near Allahabad, and in
November two people, including a police officer, were killed in an
explosion in Jhansi.

However, the municipal elections went ahead as planned, with the BJP
emerging as the clear winner.  Also in November, the federal
government confirmed that it is willing to grant autonomous region
status to Uttarakhand.  There were violent incidents in the Garhwal
mountain region in early October during a strike to press demands for
Uttarakhand to be granted separate statehood.

Anti-foreigner Sentiment
So far there have been no reported attacks on foreigners, outside of
Jammu and Kashmir, but there is a rising tide of resentment against
"Westerners" among militant Hindu groups.  In late October, the New
Delhi unit of the militant Hindu Shiv Sena group has threatened
"direct action" against the recently opened Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlet in the city if it does not leave the country immediately.  The
organization alleges that the multinational food chain is hurting the
religious sentiments of the Hindu people by indulging in the sale of
beef products.

This was followed up at the beginning of November by a conference,
organized by the Karnataka state farmers' association, which called
for multinational companies to be "driven out" of India.  Criticizing
the government's "globalizaton" policy, the conference speakers
claimed the multinationals were "exploiters" who would displace the
local people and aggravate the unemployment problem.  There was also
a call for a national movement to pursue the fight against them.

Against that background, the November decision by the state
government in Maharashtra to renegotiate the US$2.8 billion Dabhol
power project contract with Enron produced an enormous sigh of relief
from both the federal government and foreign investor community
alike.

State Chief Minister Manohar Joshi and his Shiv Sena-BJP government
unilaterally canceled the agreement with Enron Development
Corporation (EDC) in August last, after they succeeded the Congress
(I) government that negotiated the deal.

The decision dented confidence in federal government's ability to
pursue its energy sector development program, in which foreign
investment was supposed to play a major role, particularly as
neighboring Rajasthan then canceled its talks with Enron over a major
solar power project.  Enron's response to the Maharashtra decision
was to seek redress in law by opening arbitration proceedings against
the state to achieve either a declaration from the government that it
would meet its contractual obligations or pay damages to the project
partners.

JANUARY 1996

INDIA
ECONOMY

India's GDP grew by an estimated 6.2% in the financial year 1994/95,
to an estimated IR2,474.89 billion, against a growth of 5.3% to
IR2,453.06 billion in 1993/94.

The latest forecast for the Industry Ministry puts industrial sector
growth in the 1995/96 year at over 10%.  Industrial growth recovered
to 6% in 1993/94 and rose to 8.2% in 1994/95.  This year's impetus is
coming principally from strong export growth.  Currently the
industrial sector is contributing around 75% to total exports, which,
in turn, are growing at an estimated 20%.

In its 'World Economic Output' report, released on October 4, the IMF
said that recovery in India was now well established with increased
supply responses from structural reforms.  The report said that by
tightening monetary policy early this year inflation had been brought
down to single-digit levels.  It also remarked favorably on the
supply response to structural reforms and capital growth.

It forecast that the GDP could rise by 5.5% this year, with exports
continuing to grow at double-digit rates and private investment
remaining robust.  However, the IMF also advised that stronger action
be taken to reduce the fiscal deficit further and that structural
reforms be speeded up to reduce the risk of a renewed rise in
inflationary pressures.  So far, the fiscal deficit has been reduced
from 8.8% of GDP in 1992/93 to a projected 5.6% in the current year.

Privatization
The federal government accepted 167 bids for shares in four top
public sector undertakings (PSUs) - Container Corporation of India,
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL),
and the oil giant ONGC at the beginning of November.  The companies
form the first round of disinvestment of PSU shares in the current
financial year.

All valid bids which had quoted at prices equal to or above the
reserve price for each PSU were considered and the offers were
accepted in descending order of the price offered.

Inward Investment
USA
The USA is the largest foreign investor in India.  US investment
proposals increased from US$0.35 billion during the years 1975 to
1991 to US$1.7 billion during the two subsequent years and the first
quarter of 1994.

The bulk of the investment proposals were approved during 1993 and
the first half of 1994.  During this period, investment proposals
worth US$1.3 billion were approved.  In 1991-93, 804 collaborations
with the USA were approved.  However, the pace of investment appears
to be slowing.  In the first half of the current financial year, US
investments touched US$1 billion, compared with US$1.2 billion in the
same period of the 1994/95 year.  Bilateral trade this year is
expected to exceed US$8 billion.

According to a report by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce last
year, US companies intending to invest in India in the current year
include ICMC Power Consortium Inc. a joint venture comprising
Westinghouse Electric Corp. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp. and Sergeant
and Lundi.  The consortium plans to set up a power project and a
harbor complex at Cuddalore to facilitate coal imports for the power
sector.

Areas identified for potential Indo-US collaboration are
telecommunications, power, biotechnology, chemicals and allied
products, computer hardware and software, electrical and electronics
equipment, food processing, food products for children, health care
products, hybrid seeds, information technology, natural food products
with low cholesterol, petrochemicals, power generation,
semi-conductors and transport equipment.

The USA also has the highest number of technical collaborations in
India.  From the period July 1991 to July 1993, the USA accounted for
352 technical collaborations out of the total of 1719, i.e. 20% of
the total.

Meanwhile the government has said it is actively considering opening
up the insurance sector to foreign investors.  A regulatory authority
has already been set up to oversee the operations of insurance
companies and the decision on when to open the insurance sector is
expected to be finalized soon.

Legislation was passed last year to allow 49% private equity capital
in public sector banks, with the government retaining the controlling
51%.  Several public sector banks, including the State Bank of India,
have floated shares to raise capital from the public market.

Japan
Last November Japan announced its intention to participate in a
venture capital fund, the South Asia Regional Apex fund (SARA), to
help nurture local small businesses in India.  Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will join forces in the fund with
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an arm of the World
Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Both OECF and the IFC
will each put N7.5 billion into the fund, while the ADB's
contribution will be N4.5 billion.

The SARA fund expects to invest an average N20 million in small
business projects through 10 state-level funds to create 100,000 jobs
over a 15-year period.  The money will go mainly to venture companies
planning stock listing.  The fund will recover its investment by
selling stock in the firms when they go public.

India and Japan have also agreed to set up a mechanism to resolve
outstanding bilateral trade issues.  It is hoped this will lead to an
acceleration in Japanese investment in India.

Non-Resident Indian Investments
Over the past four years, NRIs have made direct investment of around
US$1 billion.  In the first five months of 1995/96, NRIs have placed
about US$232million worth of foreign direct investment in India,
three times the amount during the whole of 1992/93.

So far, approvals for NRI direct investments total US$4 billion, 30%
of total foreign direct investment approvals of US$13.6 billion.
Total NRI deposits so far are in the region of US$17.5 billion and
have been coming in at the rate of US$1.7billion a year since
1992/93.  To date US$4.4 billion are invested in India under the NRI
scheme launched in 1970 and US$6.3 billion under the FCNR (A) scheme
of 1975, which will terminate by August 1997.  The new FCNR (B)
scheme has attracted US$4.04 billion and the non-resident
non-repatriable (NRNR) scheme has brought in US$2.7 billion.

In order to boost NRI investment in the services sector, the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI - the central bank) has granted general permission
to NRIs to subscribe to company memoranda and articles of association
and to take up shares of Indian companies up to the amount of
Ir10,000 with effect from November 1, last year.  The permission
applies if the proposed venture pertains to any activity except
agriculture and plantations.  Previously, this general permission was
available only for NRI investments in industrial activities.

Tourism
Tourism currently ranks third - after the gems, jewelry and
ready-made garments sectors - in terms of foreign exchange earnings.
A total of 1.91million foreign tourists visited India in 1994/95, a
growth of 2.14% over 1993-94.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourism
in the whole country grew by 13.16% from Ir65.09 billion in 1993/94
to Ir73.6561 billion in 1994/95.

As a result, the India Tourism Development Corp. (ITDC) has surpassed
all previous achievements with an 80% increase in profits before tax,
grossing Ir430.17 million during 1994/95.  ITDC earned Ir280.37
million after tax, an increase of 132% on the figure for the previous
year.  The company has declared a dividend of Ir50.67 million for
1994/95 - the highest dividend it has ever paid.  Turnover increased
by 25% from 1993/94 to Ir2.36 billion.

The Corporation attributes the bulk of the improvement to its hotels
division - the Ashok Group - which had an increased turnover of
Ir11.45 billion and net profits of Ir220.71 million.

The violence in the Kashmir Valley has had an effect, costing the
sector an estimated 25% of its revenue.  However, the government is
hoping that this will be compensated for by a rise in tourism in the
other northern states.  Despite continuing sporadic violence in
Assam, Tripura and Mehalaya, the government has withdrawn the
Restricted Area designation from them.

INDIA
FINANCE

Despite the uplift in exports, India's trade deficit jumped to
US$1.976 billion in the April-August period last year, from a deficit
of US$798.53 million in the same period of 1994. Imports in August
are estimated at US$2.924 billion, compared with US$2.24 billion in
August 1994.  The import growth during the month was 30.53%.  The
increase in petroleum, oil and lubricant (POL) imports was 2.54%.
Non-oil import growth was 38.99% in the month.

Exports in the April-August period are estimated at US$12.302 billion
compared with US$9.613 in April-August 1994 - a growth of 27.97%.
The level of exports in August 1995, at US$2.452 billion, is the
highest is the highest monthly figure so far in the current financial
year.  It is also 20% higher than exports of US$2.106 billion in
August 1994.  Imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at
US$14.278 billion as against US$10.411 billion in the corresponding
period of 1994.

POL imports during April-August 1995 are estimated at US$2.762
billion compared with US$2.263 billion during April-August 1994.  POL
imports increased by 17% during this period.

Reserves
The nation's foreign exchange reserves, excluding gold and special
drawing rights (SDRs), fell sharply for the second month in a row at
the end of October last by US$3.052 billion to US$17.757 billion.
The foreign exchange reserves stood at US$20.809 billion at the end
of the 1994/95 financial year.

The slow accretion in foreign exchange or the down slide in reserves
is mainly accounted for by increased imports under the liberalized
regime, according to the Finance Ministry.

Meanwhile, Russia agreed to settle about 900 Indian claims amounting
to Ir800 million, during a meeting between the two sides in Moscow at
the end of October.  The claims relate to export contracts,
non-exports, including personal savings with Soviet banks, pensions,
fees and third country contracts.  They have been pending since
December 1992 when the former Soviet Union collapsed.

Exchange Rate
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was forced to intervene again on
October 26 to halt the slide of the rupee against the US dollar.  The
dollar opened at Ir35.50 and gradually went up to a high of Ir35 on
the interbank foreign exchange market.

At this stage, the RBI intervened by selling dollar at a rate lower
than the prevailing market price.  After the intervention, the rupee
firmed up and closed at Ir35.50/US$.

Banking sources attributed the fall in the rupee value to short-term
economic conditions arising out of a rise in imports and government's
debt payments.  As a result of demand-supply gap, market forces are
pushing the dollar upwards.

PAKISTAN
POLITICS

Prime Minister Bhutto's policy of encouraging members of the former
international Islamic fundamentalist Mujaheddin that fought the
Russians in Afghanistan to use Pakistan as a base to wage an intifada
(her expression) against India's "occupation" of Kashmir, is possible
coming back to haunt her.

Not only is the violence in Karachi - almost certainly fueled by arms
and expertise gathered in the Afghan conflict - continuing unabated,
but the government's near "open-door" policy to militant
fundamentalists from the Islamic world undoubtedly contributed to the
ease with which Arab terrorists were able to mount their devastating
attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad on November 19.

The embassy was wrecked by two explosions, which killed a total of 18
people and injured 60.  Three Egyptian militant groups in Cairo
claimed responsibility for the attack and the evidence so far is that
it was carried out mainly, if not completely by foreign nationals.
Talk in Islamabad is of a team of eight, mostly Egyptians, belonging
to an extremist Islamic organization, Takfir wal-Hirjah.  However,
there has been talk of Sudanese, Jordanians and Afghans being
involved as well.

The group is believed to have entered Pakistan via Afghanistan and
may have had internal logistical support inside Pakistan from either
the immigrant Arab community in Peshawar or from the International
Islamic University in Islamabad.  After the bombing Interior Minister
Nasirullah Khan Babar said that the University had become a "hideout
of terrorists".  President Leghari, however, dismissed the statement
saying there was no evidence of University people taking part in the
bombing.

Expulsions
The government did come to a belated recognition of the dangers of
giving house-room to so many potential fanatics just before the
embassy bombing, with Babar announcing a crackdown on illegal
immigrants in October.  However, the move was weighted entirely on
those immigrants who might add to the security collapse in Karachi
and Sind province generally. Those groups who support or engage in
the struggle against Indian forces in Kashmir remained untouched as
did the religious seminaries, packed with Arab students, that
fulminate against the West and preach a doctrine of Islam
unadulterated by 1,500 years of history.

It was only after the bombing that the government ordered the
expulsion of all Arabs without legal documents.

The 600-700 immigrants expelled by the government in October were all
Bangladeshis.  Interior Minister Babar said they had been expelled
because they had fake documents.

The more probable reason is that the government believes that the
majority of them are at best sympathetic to, and at worst actual
supporters of, the ethnic Indian Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) that is
wrecking such havoc in urban Sind.  According to the government there
are some two million illegal immigrants in Karachi.

The move is also a slap in the a face to Bangladesh over the
contentious issue of the Bihari Muslims.  In 1974, Pakistan agreed to
accept as Pakistani nationals all those Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh
who did not accept the new country as theirs.

Between then and 1992, Pakistan did admit around 150,000 Biharis, who
had blood relations in Pakistan, into the country.  However, it has
not officially admitted any more since then, leaving some 250,000
Biharis stranded in Bangladesh..

During her state visit to Pakistan earlier last year, Bangladeshi
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia Rahman asked her hosts to make good on
their 1974 commitment.  In this she was backed up by the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC), which provides funds for the
rehabilitation of repatriated Biharis.

The Prime Minister and the OIC got there reply in October when
Interior Minister Babar said that if they were so concerned the Arab
countries should take the Biharis as there was plenty of room for
them in the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and elsewhere in West Asia.

Military in Politics
The role of the military in the governance of the country has come to
the fore again with the announcement that the government had foiled
an alleged coup attempt by a group of military officers.

The significance of the coup bid, which was reportedly discovered in
September and announced in November, was to be carried out by a group
calling itself Amirul Momineen (leaders of the faithful).  It was led
by Major-General Zahirul Islam Abbasi, a former defense attachi in
the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi where he was expelled as a
spy, and Brigadier Mustansar Billa.  They led a group of officers,
including three colonels, and civilians, reportedly numbering around
30 in all.  The group is also believed to have links with ex-generals
and right-wing politicians.

It has been claimed that the plotters were caught by chance at a
meeting on September 28 when they were putting the finishing touches
to their plans to "eliminate all senior commanders of the Pakistan
Army, before taking over key government installations.

The army and government have attempted to play down the seriousness
of the coup attempt.  However, it is significant, not only in that it
was apparently thwarted purely by chance, but also in that it
highlights a growing dissatisfaction in the military with Prime
Minister Bhutto's government (many senior officers much prefer her
predecessor Nawaz Sharif).  It also indicates a division in the
senior ranks of the military between those who are prepared to put up
with an elected civilian government so long as they and theirs are
taken care of, and those who want the army to return to its near
traditional role as direct political master.

The message for Prime Minister Bhutto seems fairly clear.  If she
wants to keep the premiership, and possibly her head, she will have
to pander to the military to an even greater extent than she has
already.  That could mean even greater direct involvement in Kashmir,
with all the dangers of an all-out war with India that such an
escalation would bring.

Political Terrorism
With talks between the government and the MQM still stalled, the
situation in the city remains as murderous as ever with tit-for-tat
killings by MQM-Altaf group activists and the security forces taking
place on a daily basis.

The more notable atrocities include the killing of four MQM prisoners
while in police custody in October; the murder of Syed Ehsan Ali
Shah, a brother of the Sind Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah, with
two other people on November 23; and the killing of 15 members of the
same family in a separate incident on the same day.

Fourteen people were sentenced to death  for terrorist acts on
November 27.

Political murder is not, however confined to Karachi, or even to Sind
province overall. Ali Ahmed Soomro, a former member of the ruling
Pakistan people's Party who had fallen out of favor was gunned down
outside his home in October (Prime Minister Bhutto's brother-in-law,
Nasir Hussain was questioned by police over the incident and
released).  In November, the provincial minister of Balochistan, Ayub
Buledi, the provincial election commissioner Faratullaha and their
driver were all shot dead in Turbat.

Political Corruption
The campaign to "get" former prime minister and opposition Pakistan
Muslim League (PML) leader Nawaz Sharif continues apace.  After
getting out from under a treason charge in September last year,
Sharif is now being undermined by the arrest of his brother, Shahbaz
Sharif, and a new pile of fraud allegations against his family.  In
order to ensure that the public at large recognizes the solidity of
the case being made, Interior Minister Babar outlined the allegations
on television on November 23.

According to Babar, the Sharif family fraudulently acquired a total
of Pr6.16 billion from 31 banks and financial institutions through
the use of political pressure during the period 1983-1993.

The government's case is that the money had been pressured out of
Pakistani banks and financial institutions by 19 companies owned by
the Sharif family.  A particular case in point is the family owned
Ittefaq Foundry (IF).  Records of the New York Branch of the National
Bank of Pakistan apparently show that IF opened letters of credit
with a number of nationalized banks in order to finance the import of
scrap metal worth US$17.84 million.

Not only did IF never meet any of its obligations on the letters of
credit, it also used political pressure to force the banks to adjust
the amount of the letters of credit by securing loans from the banks.
The scrap was sold on at a profit and none of the loans have ever
been repaid.

It is also claimed that during 1990-1993, IF sold machinery to 11
sugar mills for a total of Pr1,334 million.  The banks that financed
the deal were never repaid.  Moreover, political pressure was used to
force the sugar mills to buy machinery from IF and to force the banks
to make loans only to those mills that did agree to buy machinery
from IF.

Other scams allegedly indulged in by the family include the illegal
purchase of travelers' checks.  According to Babar, the family had
arranged the purchase of US$1.13 million worth of travelers' checks,
which were used as collateral "in a dubious manner" for securing
heavy loans.  Shahbaz Sharif is also accused of taking loans from
banks by forging signatures of other partners in his companies, like
Mian Khalid Diraj.

The problem for Nawaz Sharif in all this is that if his brother goes
down, Nawaz will almost certainly follow suit.

Afghanistan
The breakdown in relations with the regime of President Borhanoddin
Rabbani remains as deep as ever.  On November 22, the Pakistani
government stopped issuing permits for the transport of goods and
foodstuffs to Afghanistan until further notice and on November 28 it
expelled two representatives of the Hezb-e Wahdat faction, which is
allied to the Rabbani government.  These latest expulsions bring the
total of those expelled since the sacking of the Pakistani embassy in
Kabul in September to 19 Afghan diplomats and 11 officials, plus
Masud Khalili, the Afghan president's special representative in
Islamabad.

PAKISTAN
ECONOMY

The government has dismissed as baseless the general chorus of alarm
which greeted its decision to devalue the Pakistani rupee by 7% at
the end of October.  The decision was not, she argued, forced on the
government by the domestic economic situation, but by the fact that
both Bangladesh and India had devalued their currencies.  Given the
competing nature of these economies, vis-`-vis Pakistan, Pakistan had
no alternative but to follow suit in order to maintain its
competitive edge in world markets.

Whatever the reason for devaluation were in these countries, she
argued, the fact that Pakistan needed to devalue by only 7% was an
indicator of its relative economic strength.  Indeed, she claimed,
rather than experiencing an economic decline, as some domestic
observers maintained, the economy was actually going from strength to
strength, recording a consistent rise in the GDP over the past two
years.

Any damage to the economy, she said, was being done by the media,
whose reports were responsible for more than US$300 million in
capital being withdrawn from the banks and stock exchanges prior to
the devaluation.  This capital flight, she said, also reflected the
evil intentions of the vested interests who have no concern about the
national interest, but will do anything to serve their own interests.

For its part the government said the media had seized on the fact
that the 6.9% GDP growth target for 1994/95 had not been met (GDP
growth in the year was actually 4.7%, compared with 3.8% in 1993/94)
and had blown it up out of all proportion.  This failure, it
intimated, was a minor, almost technical matter, due to the cotton
sector failing to meet its production target, as it has for the past
three years, to some other crops had been damaged by rains and
floods, and to problems in the textile sector.  Despite all this,
industrial output grew by 5% in 1994/95 against 4.5% in 1993/94.

A rather more accurate summation of the situation was given by
President Leghari in an address to parliament on October 29.
Although he too dismissed all talk of an economic crisis, he did
admit that economic performance in 1994/95 was "mixed".  On the
positive side inflation remains under control, the GDP is expanding,
and fiscal and monetary policy should enable the inflation rate to
less than 10% in the 1995/96 year.  In addition, the rapid growth in
exports had resulted in a substantial increase in foreign exchange
reserves.

On the downside, the president admitted that reserves had begun to
decline, but that the most pressing problem was the fiscal deficit.
This stands somewhat at odds with the government's claim of success
in bringing the deficit down from 8% of GDP in November 1994 to 5.5%
of GDP in 1994/95.  The deficit is forecast to fall to 5% in 1995/96,
with the GDP expanding by 6.5%.

According to the government, its borrowing on the domestic market had
been reduced to Pr30 billion from Pr60 billion in 1994, and it has
repaid foreign loans of US$200 million, for the first time.  With
the privatization of the Kot Addu power plant, the repayment of
another US$700 million in foreign debt will be repaid.  The total
foreign debt now stands at around US$30 billion.

In November, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (EEC)
announced a number of initiatives to promote growth.  The support
price of wheat was increased from Pr160 to Pr165 per 40 kg to help
boost to agricultural growth.  In addition, the limit on loans
without collateral was raised fromPr50,000 to Pr100,000 to help the
development of the small business sector.  Action was also taken to
boost the industrial output of some products that suffer from
smuggling.

Inward Investment
Foreign investment rose by US$0.65 billion in the 1994/95 year to
US$1.53 billion. The main investing countries are the USA, Canada,
the UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

As for the current, 1995/96, year, the flow of foreign investment
more than doubled in the first three months (July-September 1995)
compared with the first quarter of 1994/95, to US$250 million,
despite an "erratic" stock market.  Of the total investment, more
than US$220 million was in direct investment as compared with US$106
million in the first quarter of last year.

According to the Board of Investment, the private foreign investment
flow in 1994/995 amounted to over US$1.5 billion, compared with
US$640 million in 1993/94..

SRI LANKA
POLITICS

The government launched its second and final offensive - Operation
Rivieresa (Sunshine) - against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) in the Jaffna peninsula on October 1.  In announcing the
attack the deputy defense minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said the
government had no intention of slowing or aborting the war, but
intend to press on to finish it by the end of the year.  The actual
result has been less decisive than the government had hoped..

In terms of conventional military confrontation, the offensive has
been highly successful. Outnumbering the LTTE in men and materiel, as
well as in training and tactics, the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), made
steady advance towards the city of Jaffna throughout October, tough
its progress did slow significantly as it drew nearer to its target
and LTTE defense became more and more desperate.  Well over 1,000
LTTE fighters were killed in the operation and the SLA finally
entered Jaffna proper on the morning of November 20.

However, the LTTE has refused to surrender or to negotiate.  Despite
the loss of the city which formed the capital of the LTTE's Tamil
Eelam, the organization's leader, Veluppillai Prabhakaran, has
dispersed part of his forces to the eastern coastal area with the aim
of continuing a guerrilla war against the state, while in Jaffna
proper up to 1,000 still continue to engage the SLA.

The LTTE's ability to wreak havoc well outside of Jaffna was
demonstrated, again, even during the SLA's offensive.  On October 20
it launched an attack on the strategic Kolonnawa and Urogodawatte oil
installations.  Fortunately for the government, the terrorists missed
their main target, the gasoline tanks in zone two of the 95 acre
site, and set fire to two kerosene tanks and a diesel tank instead.
On November 11, LTTE suicide bombers set off two explosions near the
SLA's headquarters in the capital, Colombo, killing at least 20
civilians and injuring 30 others.

The fact that a crushing military defeat for the LTTE in Jaffna will
not necessarily mean the end of its guerrilla and terror operations,
has always been recognized by the government.  Its hope, however, is
that establishing its control in the Jaffna peninsula will enable it
to install a democratically elected provincial Tamil  government in
the area.  This coupled with generous development aid, should, it is
hoped, undercut popular support for the LTTE.  Without extensive
grassroots support, the LTTE will find it increasingly difficult to
mount its guerrilla and terror operations.

To the government's credit it has gone out of its way to secure the
support of the democratic Tamil parties for this program.  In their
turn, these parties, particularly the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front (EPRLF) and the Eelam people's Democratic Party
(EPDP).  The EPDP, in particular, has suffered a great deal at the
hands of the LTTE.  In October, the EPDP claimed that the LTTE had
killed more than 3,000 Tamil political activists since 1986.  Of
these, 1,700 were members of the EPDP, while most of the remainder
belonged to the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO).  Those
killed included the leader of TELO, Sri Sabaratnam, the former leader
of the opposition A. Amirthalingam, and the human rights' lawyer Sam
Thambimuthu.  The LTTE stepped up its offensive against its rivals in
1987 after the Indo-Sri Lanka pact was signed.

Despite its confident progress on the military front, the government
very nearly suffered a major political embarrassment at the beginning
of November when the ubiquitous Doctor G.L. Peiris handed in his
resignation.  As deputy prime minister, deputy finance minister,
justice minister and constitutional affairs minister. Peiris's loss
could well have thrown the government into turmoil.

The cause of the upset was a row between Peiris and the Secretary to
the Treasury A.S. Jayewardene over the settlement of a long-pending
controversy over a hotel.  Not surprisingly, President Kumaratunga
refused to accept Peiris's resignation, and the matter was settled
when Jayewardene resigned instead.

With the LTTE resolved to continue to prosecute a guerrilla war, the
government has looked again at the organization's financing.  This
was brought into sharp relief in early November when two Catholic
priests - Saverimuttu Jebanason, secretary to the Bishop in Jaffna,
and Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius of the Faxel Center of the Catholic
Church in nearby Kilinochchi - were stopped on their way to Jaffna
and found to be smuggling large amounts of cash and possible
bomb-making equipment.

The Revered Saverimuttu Jebanason was found to be carrying Sr11.27
million, while the Reverend Mariapillai Emmanuel Pius had Sr2.2
million.  The money, together with copper wire and batteries, was
found in the false bottoms of their suitcases.

Subsequent police investigation found that the two men had a total of
Sr24 million (Jebanason Sr19 million and Pius Sr5 million) in various
bank accounts.  This money, the police allege, was the result of a
laundering operation to channel funds from various organizations to
the LTTE. Part of the money found in the bank accounts, Sr1.5
million, appears to have originated from a series of bank robberies
carried out by an LTTE member, Kuttimani, in the early 1980s.
Kuttimani was killed while in detention during the prison riots in
Colombo in 1983.  However, it now appears that before his death he
entrusted at least Sr1.5 million of the money he stole to the priests
to be invested in a finance company.

The authorities also believe that members of the Catholic clergy in
are involved in a multi-million rupee foreign exchange racket to
channel funds to the LTTE.  They have now asked for Interpol
assistance to pursue the investigation.

According to government sources, around US$8 million and Sr10 million
was collected from various foreign and local individuals and
organizations for the LTTE over the past few years.  They also claim
that another important source of income for the LTTE is drug
trafficking in the USA Europe and Asia.  According to the Foreign
Ministry, about 481,000 Sri Lankans went abroad after 1983, the
majority of them Tamils and LTTE sympathizers, many of whom
contribute to the LTTE.

Of these expatriates, 60,000 are in Italy, 25,000 in Switzerland,
30,000 in Denmark, 60,000 in Canada, 20,000 in the USA, 5,000 in the
Netherlands, 60,000 in France, 70,000 in the UK, 65,000 in Germany
and 53,000 in India.  In future, fund raisers who maintain bank
accounts in support of the LTTE can be indicted and bank accounts
frozen under the emergency regulations.

SRI LANKA
ECONOMY

The economy continued to improve during the first seven months of
1995, despite rising defense expenditure, largely as a result of a
20% increase in exports, compared with the same period of 1994.
Exports in the first seven months of last year US$2.072 billion.

Amazingly, tourism was also up, with a total of 280,000 tourists
visiting the country by the end of August.  The rise in exports and
tourism receipts boosted the foreign exchange reserves to Sr136,868
by the end of August.

The manufacturing sector grew by 9% in real terms last year and
accounted for 95% of the overall growth in the GDP. Overall, the GDP
is estimated to have grown by 5.5% last year.

This year, the government is aiming for a GDP growth of over 6%.
Total investment in relation to GDP is projected to rise to about 27%
from 25.5% last year.  The agricultural sector is expected to grow by
3%, while exports are projected to grow by Sr44,592 million, with
industrial exports rising by 18% to Sr183,104 million.

SRI LANKA
FINANCE

However, with defense expenditure expected to have soared to Sr30-33
billion by the end of last year against a 1995 budget estimate of
Sr24 billion has thrown the government's finances off balance.  The
additional defense expenditure, coupled with higher than expected
costs for the government's wheat subsidy and rising debt service
costs are expected to have pushed last year's budget deficit up to
around 9.3% of GDP, compared with the budget target of 7.5% of GDP.

As a result, even if the military operations against the LTTE
continue to go in the government's failure, Sri Lanka is going to
have to live with high budget deficits right through to the end of
the century.

The 1996 budget, presented to parliament on November 8, projects
revenues at Sr18 billion.  On the expenditure side, a combination of
cuts and savings of Sr4.6 million produced a gross spending figure of
Sr273.4 billion.  Against this there is Sr185.9 billion in revenue
and grants, resulting in an overall deficit of Sr87.4 billion.  This
is to be met by foreign borrowings of Sr32.7 billion and domestic
non-inflationary financing of Sr54.7 billion.   Overall, the
government is projecting a budget deficit of l7.8% of GDP this year,
to be followed by deficits of 6.6% in 1997 and 5.1% in 1998.

The budget package includes a package of tax concessions, reductions
in excise and customs duties, measures to develop the capital market
and investment, and a salary hike to civil servants.  The defense
levy introduced in 1992 and currently standing at 4.5% will continue
at that level for through this year, but under a new name, the
national security levy.  It will however be reduced to 2% for imports
of capital goods.

The tax exemption threshold has been increased from Sr60,000 to
Sr100,000.  This will cost the government Sr40 million in lost
revenue.  The intermediate tax rates have also been reduced - the
first Sr35,000 within the tax bracket will be subject to a 10% rate,
the next bracket 15%, and the next two brackets to 25% and 35%.

The budget introduces a new consolidated welfare program in place of
the existing welfare programs.  Under this, the most vulnerable
families will be given a monthly income transfer of Sr1,000 per
family, while other poor families are given Sr500 per family.  There
are also incentives to sustain high production in the agricultural
sector.

High priority will continue to be given to public enterprise reforms
with a view to encouraging inward investment in the main sectors of
the economy.  Peiris noted that last year's foreign aid commitment of
US$843 million was confirmation of foreign confidence of the
government's handling of both the economy and the military conflict.

On specific allocations, fundamental economic facilities are to
receive Sr14,900 million and ports' expansion Sr5,500 million. Large
financial allocations have been made for transportation,
telecommunications, power and highways.  The estimated expenditure on
fundamental facilities is Sr6,920 million; agriculture Sr4,800
million and the development of social infrastructure (education,
health and youth affairs) Sr7,160 million.

     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.

     Premier mulling offshore heliport in Okinawa Pref.
     Yomiuri
     GINOWAN, Okinawa
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said here Tuesday that the government
will consider a U.S. proposal to build an offshore heliport in Okinawa
Prefecture to replace Futenma Air Station.
     Hashimoto visited the prefecture for the first time as prime minister at
the invitation of Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota.
     Hashimoto first held talks with Ota in Ginowan, home of the U.S. Futenma
Marine Corps Air Station. Following the meeting, Hashimoto delivered a speech
to local politicians and business leaders.
     "The United States offered a new proposal to conduct a joint feasibility
study for building a removable heliport at sea," Hashimoto said in the speech.
"I think this is an option worth considering."
     The United States is proposing an ocean heliport off Urazoe, Okinawa
Prefecture.
     After returning from Okinawa Tuesday evening, Hashimoto said that he will
propose a Japan-U.S. joint discussion on the new heliport plan during summit
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for Sept. 24.
     It is highly possible that at the summit meeting the two leaders will
agree to study the heliport proposal.
     Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo that he had also considered the
offshore heliport plan because negotiations between the two countries over
replacement of Futenma Air Station were experiencing difficulties.
     Japan proposed that the heliport in the air station be integrated into
Kadena Air Base, but the United States has been hoping to buildt it at Camp
Schwab in the northern part of Okinawa Prefecture.
     Hashimoto said he is also considering a removable floating heliport
because it causes less harm to the environment than a man-made island.
     In his Okinawa speech, Hashimoto expressed regret at the central
government's lack of efforts to ease Okinawans' suffering over the dominant
presence of the U.S. military. The prime minister vowed continued effort to
reduce U.S. bases in the prefecture.
     Regarding economic development of the prefecture, Hashimoto proposed
constructiing an international convention center combined with a shopping
center.
     Hashimoto's visit came on the heels of Ota's decision to abide by the
prime minister's order to proceed with legal procedures to force Okinawa
landowners to renew leases for U.S. bases.
     In his speech, Hashimoto congratulated Ota for "making a very difficult
decision as governor."
     Hashimoto added that, "Throughout history, Okinawans have undergone a
series of hardships. We, Japanese citizens, need to earnestly admit that we
did not necessarily make our best effort to understand the historic burden and
feelings of people in Okinawan, who played a key role in maintaining peace and
balance between our nation and Asia."
     The prime minister said, "We will also try to improve situations in the
prefecture by reviewing various issues concerning the Japan-U.S. Status of
Forces Agreement."
     "The U.S. proposal pertaining to a possible offshore heliport is worth
considering despite the fact that many obstacles must be solved before such a
plan is realized," Hashimoto added.
     Regarding the various plans to promote Okinawa's economy, Hashimoto
proposed building a health center and facilities designed for long stays. He
also proposed a marine and agricultural research institution to conduct
various studies under the subtropical climate.
     Also proposed were an international convention center combined with a
tourism facility and shopping mall, as well as a special "multimedia"
district.
     Ocean heliport
     The ocean heliport proposed by Hashimoto as a possible option to replace
the Futenma Air Station is generally known as a "mega float." The offshore
structure, which would be built with several huge iron blocks and anchored to
the seabed, would not be a permanent facility.
     According to the government, such a facility has major advantages as it
could be easily dismantled, would not cause noise pollution or cause red sand
to flow into the ocean, which was triggered in the past by construction of
base facilities.
     Japan has insisted that the Futenma air base be merged with the Kadena
airfield, while the United States has demanded that a new facility be built at
Camp Schwab. Both sides rare deeply divided.
     Task force to be formed
     The government Tuesday formally decided to establish a new task force in
charge of discussing basic plans for the development of Okinawa.
     The government decided on the creation of the Okinawa Policy Council at
Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.
     Hashimoto promised the establishment of a task force in his meeting with
Ota on Sept. 10.
     The task force will debate various policies concerning the prefecture,
including economic development and the base issues.
     All Cabinet members except Hashimoto and the director-general of the
Hokkaido Development Agency will take part in the task force.

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party

     37 legislators attend meeting to launch party
     Yomiuri
     A committee set up Tuesday to organize the launch of Minshuto (Democratic
Party) attracted 37 legislators who are set to join the new party.
     The participants included 16 lawmakers from the Social Democratic Party,
eight from New Party Sakigake (Pioneers), five from Citizens Action League,
six independents and two House of Councillors members from the SDP. Two of the
participants also are deputies for two Diet members.
     The inaugural meeting of the organizing committee named Yukio Hatoyama to
head a group that will devise strategies for the upcoming lower house
election.
     Hatoyama and Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan were chosen as
co-directors of the organizing committee.
     The committee will hold a meeting Sunday to celebrate the Democratic
Party's inauguration. The party's election strategy headquarters hopes to
produce by then a list of candidates who will run in the upcoming general
election with the party's official backing, according to committee officials.
     SDP leaders held several meetings Tuesday to discuss procedures for
allowing party members to join the Democratic Party.
     The SDP earlier said that all party members would be allowed to
participate in the Democratic Party. But SDP chief Tomiichi Murayama told
participants at the meetings that he had changed his mind and opposed
Hatoyama's reported plan to screen SDP candidates who hope to run on the new
party's ticket in the election, sources said. Hatoyama's idea could mean that
some SDP members would be admitted into the new party but not receive its
endorsement in the election.
     Some SDP members have insisted on fielding candidates with the support of
their party. That scenario could split the SDP, according to observers.
     Tuesday's inaugural meeting of the Democratic Party's organizing
committee marked a new phase in the party's creation.
     Nonetheless, Hatoyama and Kan, both chief promoters of the Democratic
Party, remain split over some issues, such as whether and how to urge Sakigake
members to join the new party, and its relationship with the administration of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
     Shoichi Ide, Hiroyuki Sonda and other Sakigake officials Tuesday told Kan
and Hatoyama that they would not join the new party.
     Hatoyama has said that he does not want Sakigake leaders to participate
in the new party, while Kan has insisted that the new party include
mid-ranking and experienced politicians, which would open the door to Sakigake
veterans.
     Sakigake scrambles
     New Party Sakigake (Pioneers) faces the desperate task of shoring up its
rapidly weakening position, as junior members are certain to leave Sakigake to
join the ranks of the planned Democratic Party.
     During a meeting Tuesday, Sakigake officials adopted proposals regarding
promoting administrative reform in an effort to impress voters with their
policies during the election campaign.
     Sakigake's plan calls for individual politicians and parties to join
hands in establishing after the election an administration dedicated to
streamlining administrative operations.

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port

     Uranium unloaded at Rokkashomura port
     Yomiuri
     AOMORI
     A ship from France carrying 620 tons of uranium for processing at a
uranium enrichment plant began unloading its cargo Tuesday at Mutsu Ogawara
Port in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture.
     Japan Nuclear Fuel, Ltd., which announced the ship's schedule and the
amount of uranium on board as instructed by the Science and Technology Agency,
chartered the 5,600-ton Eastern Hero.
     After the ship docked at about 7:20 a.m., 18 rods were loaded on a
trailer and transported to the nearby enrichment plant.
     Although police were on full alert when the rods were unloaded, there
were only about 10 protesters at the enrichment facility, which has been in
operation since 1992.
     The protesters were calling for a complete stop to the use of nuclear
energy.
     The cargo includes 50 uranium cylinders, and unloading will continue
until Thursday.

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods

     Govt to simplify drug reporting methods
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry plans to simplify the system of
monitoring medical products so that pharmacists and nurses--not just
doctors--can file reports with the ministry.
     The ministry will revise the 1967 system because they received no reports
on the side effects of the unheated blood products that infected many
hemophiliacs with HIV, the AIDS virus.
     In addition, when 16 people died within a month of the introduction of
the anti-shingles drug Sorivudine in 1993, there were "almost no reports,"
ministry officials said.
     Under the current system, about 3,000 medical institutions in Japan are
designated to submit reports, but in fiscal 1995 the ministry received only
1,900.
     Some medical institutions have not filed any reports, ministry sources
said.
     Under a similar system in the United States, more than 15,000 reports are
channeled to the U.S. government each year, the sources said.
     They said the ministry is consulting specialists on ways to change the
system.
     The present system is laborious because it takes at least two hours to
fill in the appropriate form, the sources said, and details of liver, kidney
and blood examinations must be included with each report.
     Under the revised system, which will be implemented during fiscal 1997,
the medical services will be able to submit reports to the ministry about even
vague side effects, and the forms will be simplified.
     "Under the present system, pharmacists and nurses in theory can submit
such reports, but in practice they are unable to do so because their reports
must bear the seal of the medical doctors concerned," officials said.
     Using the revised forms, they will only be required to fill in their
names and the reports can be submitted directly to the ministry without going
through doctors, they said.

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen

     Teacher's abuse of student costs 500,000 yen
     Yomiuri
     The Tokyo District Court awarded 500,000 yen to a 15-year-old girl and
her father Tuesday in a lawsuit against the city for abuse the girl suffered
when she was struck by her middle school teacher.
     Kanako Soejima, now a high school student, was slapped across her face
twice by her social studies teacher in November 1994, when she was attending
Chuo Middle School in Kurume, western Tokyo.
     The male teacher hit her when she complained of the way he led the class.
The teacher reportedly struck her, saying, "Just say that again" and "What is
this face you make?"
     Presiding Judge Takashi Sonoo said the teacher's violence was out of line
and sparked by his emotions.
     "The plaintiff was not injured and 500,000 yen might be seen as expensive
compensation," Sonoo said. But, he added, the court needed to hand down such a
ruling as an indication that corporal punishment should be eliminated from the
classroom.
     After Soejima was slapped by her teacher, she and her father Hiroaki, a
lawyer, filed a complaint with the school. The teacher and the middle school
principal then wrote them a written apology.
     But the Soejimas said the apology was not earnest and decided to file a
lawsuit against the teacher, the middle school principal, the metropolitan
government and the city's board of education.
     They demanded 6 million yen in damages and insisted that the written
apology be displayed on the school bulletin board.
     In the ruling, Sonoo said corporal punishment was banned after World War
II under the School Education Law.
     But, he said, it was a concern that corporal punishment had not been
completely eliminated and that there were even people who defended it.
     "Corporal punishment says to students that violence is the answer to
problems," Sonoo said, adding that violent acts by teachers could not be
called education.
     Sonoo ruled that Soejima suffered grave mental anguish.
     The district court's ruling follows an order by the Hachioji Summary
Court for the teacher to pay 100,000 yen to Soejima. The order was handed down
last December in a criminal complaint filed against the teacher.
     The teacher had resigned and began teaching at another school in March
last year.

     Residents fight quake reconstruction

     Residents fight quake reconstruction
     Yomiuri
     ASHIYA, Hyogo
     Six landowners filed a lawsuit against the Construction Ministry on
Tuesday, demanding it stop an earthquake reconstruction project that requires
them to give up part of their own properties for public use.
     The project calls for more open public space and the widening of two
roads to make the 13.4-hectare area, which was damaged in the Great Hanshin
Earthquake, safer if there is another major disaster.
     However, landowners have to contribute part of their own properties to
provide the extra space. If their properties are too small, they have to
contribute money equivalent to the value of the land they would otherwise be
required to surrender.
     Kenzo Otani, 41, a company worker of Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, and five
other landowners in the area filed a suit with Kobe District Court,
complaining that it is unfair to force the project on residents against their
will.
     The plaintiffs say they will not get any benefit from wider roads and
larger public space, while reduction of their properties is a burden.
     They also say it is a violation of their property rights and unfair to
put such a financial cost on quake victims.

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood

     Green Cross exec approved shipments of unsafe blood
     Yomiuri
     OSAKA
     A former Green Cross Corp. executive authorized continued shipments of
its products that were suspected of being contaminated with the AIDS-causing
virus on the request of sales division employees even after safe products had
been approved by the government, The Yomiuri Shimbun learned Tuesday.
     According to sources close to Green Cross, the executive, 75, who headed
the sales division at the time, told his colleagues and associates that he had
allowed employees to distribute HIV-tainted unheated blood products after the
Health and Welfare Ministry approved the sale of heated blood products in
December 1985.
     A member of the company's administrative council at the time, he was also
responsible for the collection of unheated blood products that had already
been shipped, following the ministry's approval of safe, heated blood
products.
     After senior employees in the company's sales division decided to
continue selling unheated blood products, the executive acknowledged their
decision on his discretion, but failed to report this to the council, the
sources said.
     The executive is under investigation by the Osaka District Public
Prosecutors Office in relation to a suit that was filed against the company's
former president, Renzo Matsushita, also 75, for the death of a man who died
of AIDS after receiving doses of Green Cross products in the treatment of his
liver ailment.
     The sales division in January 1986 distributed to the company's branch
offices a written notice under the name of Matsushita that instructed the
shipments of the unheated blood products should continue "because it will take
three months to secure a sufficient supply of heated products."
     Prosecutors are investigating whether Matsushita was aware of the
continued shipments and are trying to determine who was responsible for
failing to collect and suspend sales of the unheated products.

     Ministry eyes crisis management team

     Ministry eyes crisis management team
     Yomiuri
     The Health and Welfare Ministry decided Tuesday to inaugurate a crisis
management team next month to serve as a liaison between divisions and bureaus
in cases of medical emergencies, a ministry official said.
     Learning valuable lessons from recent cases such as the widespread HIV
infection through tainted blood products and the O-157 epidemic, the ministry
said it hopes to improve its lax crisis management system and set up one
better equipped to handle emergency situations.
     Ministry officials also said they plan to compile a "security crisis
management manual" which should outline measures to be taken in states of
emergency.
     A team, tentatively called a coordination team for security crisis
management, will consist of more than 10 officials led by the health and
welfare science division chief and including assistant chiefs of the
Pharmaceutical Affairs bureau, the Health Services bureau and the
Environmental Health bureau, officials said.
     The team members regularly exchange information to prevent overlooking
possible dangers such as serious drug side effects, large-scale food poisoning
and new infective diseases.
     In the recent case of massive HIV infections caused by tainted blood
products, important information was funneled into a single division in the
ministry and was not shared with outside divisions. This is believed to be one
of causes that led to further spread of the infection.
     The team will be created to overcome such a typical shortcoming of the
vertical administrative structure. In cases of emergency, the team will serve
as a coordinator and liaison between the division directly responsibility for
the case, the health and welfare minister and other ministry officials.
     By setting a clear outline of responsibilities, the ministry's new manual
should urge swift and accurate administrative measures, officials said.
     In the case of side effects to pharmaceutical products, for example, the
manual will clearly define requirements and procedures for the ministry to
exercise rights such as ordering pharmaceutical firms to recall dangerous
drugs or deciding to import drugs from abroad.

     Man with knife robs mayor

     Man with knife robs mayor
     Yomiuri
     NIIGATA
     A man held the mayor of Nagaoka, Niigata Prefecture, and his wife
prisoner at knife point for 13 hours in their home and stole 40 million yen
hastily collected by a city official, police said.
     According to police, a man broke into the house of Mayor Seizaburo Hiura,
77, at about 8 p.m. Monday and threatened him and his wife, Saeko, 73, with a
kitchen knife, measuring about 30 centimeters in length. He told the couple,
"I'm in trouble with too many debts." He then demanded money.
     The man held Hiura and his wife captive in their living room on the first
floor of their home. The intruder stayed in the mayor's house for 13 hours
until Tuesday morning.
     Hiura was forced to phone Nagaoka city government official to ask him to
prepare the money. The mayor turned over 40 million yen to the man who
departed at about 9 a.m. Neither Hiura nor his wife were injured.
     The mayor reported the incident to police at 3 p.m. after the city
assembly meeting on Tuesday. The Niigata prefectural police set up an
investigation headquarters at its Nagaoka Police Station and mobilized 80
police officers to hunt down the criminal.
     Hiura and his wife told police the man appeared to be around 60, was 160
centimeters tall and was of medium build. They said he was wearing glasses, a
white shirt, dark blue pants, black shoes and dark colored cap.
     The man entered the house through the front door, which was unlocked,
police said.
     Hiura and his wife told police that they could not sleep because the man
kept threatening them with his knife throughout the night. They said when the
man left, he threatened their lives if they called the police.
     Hiura eventually reported the incident to police through another city
government employee.

     Mystery substance kills aged woman

     Mystery substance kills aged woman
     Yomiuri
     Five residents of a nursing home for elderly people suffering from
dementia apparently ingested an unidentified substance, resulting in one death
and four of the residents hospitalized Monday night, police said.
     At about 4:50 p.m., employees of the Daini Waraku Home in Ome, Tokyo,
found four female residents and one male resident on the ground, foaming at
the mouth and in pain, near a table in the home's cafeteria.
     Because there were several glasses on the table, the employees believed
the residents ingested a substance of some kind. Their stomachs were pumped
out and the five were then taken to a nearby hospital.
     One of the women, 84-year-old Chitose Matsuba, died at the hospital at
7:25 p.m. The other residents have been treated for throat pain.
     Nursing home employees told police that it is the home's policy to keep
medicines out of the reach of residents.
     There was reportedly a residue in the glasses that smelled like an
antiseptic used by the nursing home to clean toothbrushes.
     Police are continuing their investigations into the case and are
conducting an autopsy on Matsuba.
     Tokyo metropolitan government officials commented that they instruct
nursing homes for the elderly to keep drugs locked up and out of the reach of
their residents.
     The metropolitan government is currently questioning the home about its
handling of medicine and cleaning materials.

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up

     GOP report alleges 'Travelgate' cover-up
     Lani Cossette Yomiuri Shimbun Washington Bureau
     PC3
     WASHINGTON
     Congressional Republicans conclude that White House officials engaged in
an "elaborate coverup operation" to hide the involvement of President Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the controversial travel office affair,
according to the draft of a House committee report.
     Republicans investigating the matter allege that once the travel office
story was out, White House advisers constructed a "colossal damage control
effort" to protect the Clintons from political fallout by "smearing the
reputations of innocent people" and withholding relevant documents through
frivolous claims of executive privilege.
     "Travelgate," which has led investigators to the highest levels of the
White House, is the product of a 31/2-year investigation. The report targets
the president directly, claiming he knew about the firing of seven career
White House employees two days before it happened and should be held
accountable for obstructing the investigation and abusing the power of the
presidency.
     Throughout the investigation, which was prolonged by battles with the
White House over document requests, committee Republicans unearthed one piece
of evidence that served to motivate a separate investigation into the travel
office affair, led by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr who is examining Mrs.
Clinton's role in the matter.
     The previously disclosed "soul cleansing" memo by David Watkins, a key
figure in the affair, shows that Mrs. Clinton pressured senior White House
aides to fire the travel office workers, according to the report. The memo
reveals a conversation between Watkins and Mrs. Clinton in which she told
Watkins she wanted "those people out" and "our people in." Mrs. Clinton has
denied having a role in the dismissals.
     The report also claims to have records of meetings, phone calls and
contacts that demonstrate Mrs. Clinton's involvement including a letter from
Watkins to her in which he says he regretted revealing his conversation with
her to investigators, and assured her that he knew who his "client" was.
     Starr is looking into whether White House officials lied under oath or
obstructed government investigations into the firings and whether the White
House politicized the FBI in announcing a criminal investigation of travel
office employees.
     The committee plans to officially release the report along with the
Democratic findings on Wednesday. The House committee's work stands in sharp
contrast to a report released earlier this summer by the Senate Whitewater
Committee that made perjury recommendations to Starr on three senior White
House advisers based on evidence and testimony received by the committee.
     The White House has dismissed the committee's 375-page report as a waste
of taxpayer dollars and an attempt at "last-ditch, negative campaigning by
innuendo and rumor."
     The fiasco erupted in May 1993 when the story broke that seven longtime
travel office employees were fired and replaced by Clinton associates. White
House officials touted the dismissals as an accomplishment in efficiency; the
press reported it as divvying up political favors to Clinton supporters,
"political cronyism," according to the report.
     The White House accused the travel office employees of mismanagement and
the head of the office, Billy Dale, was indicted on charges of embezzlement,
although he was acquitted on all charges. Dale has come to be something of a
cause celebre among Republicans and an embarrassment to the Clintons.
     It was Dale's FBI file, which was mixed in with other documents and
released to congressional investigators, that led the committee to discover
that the White House had collected hundreds of FBI files from former Reagan
and Bush administration officials, an issue that is also under investigation
by the independent counsel. The White House maintains it was an innocent
mistake.
     The Senate voted Friday to reimburse the legal expenses Dale incurred
from the lawsuit. A White House spokesman said earlier this year Clinton would
sign it, but Clinton denied it last month, angrily responding to a reporter
that he did not believe in giving "special preference to one group of people
over others" referring to White House employees who have racked up legal bills
from Whitewater.

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing

     Finally, compromise reached over Okinawa--that settles nothing
     Hideaki Miyama
     Yomiuri
     The confrontation between the central government and the Okinawa
prefectural government has ended, at least for now, following Okinawa Gov.
Masahide Ota's decision last week to take legal steps to expropriate land for
U.S. military bases.
     Symbolic of the end to the yearlong wrangle, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto visited Okinawa on Tuesday although he was only there for about two
hours.
     However, Ota's decision to comply with the central government's request
that steps be taken for the compulsory use of land by the U.S. military does
not mean the issue has been settled.
     Despite Ota's decision, it is not certain that the Okinawa prefectural
land expropriation committee will complete its examination of the plots being
used by the U.S. forces before the leases on them expire in May next year.
     Thus, there is no guarantee that the Japanese government will be able to
legally lease plots of privately owned land at Kadena Air Base and other
facilities.
     If the committee's work is not completed in time, Kadena Air Base--the
biggest U.S. Air Force base in the Far East and considered the foremost
frontline facility under the Japan-U.S. security arrangement--will run the
risk of illegally occupying the land.
     Many problems remain for the governments of Japan, the United States and
Okinawa Prefecture.
     Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. The
Japanese government planned to invite U.S. President Bill Clinton as a state
guest in November. Stressing that the bilateral security system was a major
factor contributing to peace for Japan in the postwar years, the government
was preparing to reaffirm the alliance and issue a joint security declaration
on the occasion of his visit.
     However, the security system that was thought to be so strong was rocked
by the rape of an Okinawa primary school girl by U.S. military servicemen on
Sept. 4.
     With that incident as a turning point, antibase sentiment spread like
wildfire through the prefecture. The incident also exacerbated a deeply rooted
distrust of the Japanese government.
     Amid such developments, Ota refused to act as a proxy for antibase
landowners and sign documents for the forced use of their land by the U.S.
military.
     The central government countered by filing three separate suits against
the governor. The central government and prefectural government thus squared
off legally, politically and emotionally.
     On the other hand, Clinton, who was to remain in Japan for the state
visit after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Osaka
in November last year, canceled the trip, citing strained relations between
the White House and Congress as the reason.
     The Japan-U.S. security system served as an axis of Japan's postwar
diplomacy. However, a single incident--and subsequent rebellion by a
prefectural government--has revealed its fragility.
     Clinton finally visited Japan in April this year. Seizing on the occasion
of the Hashimoto-Clinton summit, the governments of the two countries reached
an agreement on the return of Futenma Air Station, a matter that the Okinawa
prefectural government had termed the priority issue in consolidating and
reducing U.S. bases. The two nations also issued, with much fanfare, a joint
security declaration that addressed the reduction of U.S. military bases in
Japan and promotion of bilateral cooperation in emergencies.
     However, the declaration was merely a scrap of paper representing a
political agreement between the two countries.
     Even after the declaration was issued, the central government and Okinawa
government remained at loggerheads as they battled it out in court, with the
former continuing to illegally occupy land at the U.S. Navy's Sobe
communications installation.
     The confrontation continued after the Supreme Court on Aug. 28 came down
on the side of the central government, in effect ordering Ota to take legal
steps for the forced use of land.
     Okinawa residents then voted in a prefecturewide referendum concerning
the reduction of U.S. bases and a review of the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces
Agreement.
     Because some people apparently viewed the referendum as being too
"political," with the questions worded in a way to encourage "yes" votes,
turnout was 59.53 percent, which was lower than what the prefectural
government had expected. However, 89.09 percent of those who cast ballots
wanted the U.S. military presence reduced.
     The central government and prefectural government finally moved toward a
compromise following the referendum, which meant the resolution of a number of
Okinawa-related items on the political schedule.
     Hashimoto met with Ota on Sept. 10 and explained a government plan for
promoting Okinawa's economy, complete with a concrete figure for financial
assistance. Furthermore, it was supported by the Cabinet, so that the
government would not retreat from it.
     Ota responded by saying on Sept. 13 that he would take the long-sought
steps, including publicly posting land documents.
     The central government withdrew its suits against the governor. It thus
took a year for the two sides to work out their differences.
     With Ota's reversal, some progress has been made, but Okinawa still
remains the most important strategic area under the Japan-U.S. security
alliance.
     The government must now decide where the facilities at Futenma are to be
transferred. Until this is done, the agreement on the return of the air
station will remain an empty promise.
     On the other hand, the Okinawa prefectural government must now complete
steps for the expropriation of plots scattered about Kadena Air Base and other
installations before the leases run out next May 14 so that the U.S. military
can continue using them legally.
     Since Futenma Air Station is located close to Naha and is surrounded by
residential areas, the prefectural government wants it to be returned first.
     Thus, the Japanese and U.S. governments secretly reached an accord on its
return just before the summit in April. Hashimoto and U.S. Ambassador Walter
Mondale made a "lightning" announcement on it at a joint press conference.
     However, it has not been decided where the heliport at the U.S. Marine
installation will go, although six months have passed since the announcement
was made.
     The prefectural government has called for it to be moved out of Okinawa,
but the central government has asked the United States to move it to Kadena
Air Base.
     However, there is a deadlock, as the United States is opposed to the
idea.
     The agreement on Futenma's return will take on real meaning only if the
Japanese government wins a concession from the United States on the site.
     Ota decided to have the lease documents posted, but that did not settle
the problem of expropriation.
     There is a plot of land right at the center of Kadena Air Base that is
subject to expropriation. Including the owner of that land, there are 3,000
people who own land at the 11 U.S. military installations in Okinawa.
     In compliance with Ota's decision, the prefectural land expropriation
committee on Tuesday started posting the documents in question for a period of
two weeks. It will later hold public hearings where the landowners will be
able to express their views.
     Committee Chairman Kenji Kaneshiro said, "Since there are many landowners
who live outside the prefecture, it will take about three months for the
committee to deal with just preparatory procedures."
     If that is the case, the hearings cannot be held until early next year.
And if the committee conducts such sessions at its usual pace, it will not be
able to complete its work before the leases expire in May.
     In that event, the landowners will probably demand that they be allowed
to enter the installations where their land is situated.
     It is possible for Kadena Air Base to occupy the land after the leases
expire, just as the Sobe installation illegally occupies land now. However, in
Kadena's case, unlike the Sobe facility, there are 3,000 landowners involved.
Since the majority of them firmly oppose the bases, it will perhaps be
difficult for the air base to carry out normal operations.
     If that ensues, it would mean that Kadena Air Base, a symbol of the
Japan-U.S. security alliance, would be using other people's property
illegally. That would make the bilateral alliance a "castle in the air,"
posing the possibility of collapse.
     Many problems must be resolved if the joint declaration issued by
Hashimoto and Clinton in April is to have real meaning.

     Foreign firms eye Japanese gold mine

     Foreign firms eye Japanese gold mine
     Motoshige Ito Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun
     Yomiuri
     There has been a sudden burgeoning of major U.S. retail companies in the
Japanese market.
     Sports Authority, the largest sporting goods chain store operator in the
United States, has opened its first store in Japan in Nishi Ward, Nagoya. In
Ginza, there has been much consumer interest in a store opened by Gap Inc., an
apparel chain store operator based in California. Office Depot, a major U.S.
office supply company, plans to open stores in Japan in conjunction with a
major electrical appliance manufacturer. Several other major U.S. companies
reportedly plan to launch operations in Japan.
     What has sparked this rush to enter the Japanese market? This is a
crucial question, not just for the retail trade, but for the Japanese economy
as a whole.
     The answer was supplied by Rupert Murdoch, the media tycoon who has
bought a large stake in TV Asahi to begin a multichannel digital satellite
broadcasting service called JSkyB. When asked why he wanted to launch
operations in Japan, he said the country was a large untapped gold mine. In
the eyes of foreign companies, it seems that Japan has become the land of
opportunity.
     For foreign TV companies, this would appear to be the case. With
long-established broadcasters still dominating the TV market and cable
television and multichannel satellite broadcasting yet to take root, Japan
offers lucrative opportunities to prospectors.
     Likewise with the Japanese retail sector, where domestic entrepreneurs
tend to stick to traditional business practices. Foreign corporate executives
with revolutionary ideas would appear to have immense opportunities to make
inroads in this field.
     Another important but little recognized fact is that the income level in
Japan in dollar terms has nearly tripled in the past 10 years.
     The exchange rate, which was 250 yen to the dollar about a decade ago, is
now 110 yen to the dollar. Thus, while income levels in Japan have not grown
spectacularly in yen terms, the appreciation of the yen means they have risen
2.5 times in dollar terms. Japan's per capita income, which was about 12,000
dollars in 1985, has risen to just under 35,000. dollars
     Domestically, the Japanese market appears to be almost unchanged but,
viewed from abroad, it has expanded enormously. Not surprisingly, foreign
corporations are keen to tap into this rich vein.
     U.S. companies, which were rather hesitant in the past, have begun to
take a more active interest in Japan. The recent trade dispute between Japan
and the United States over cars and semiconductors stemmed largely from
growing U.S. interest in the Japanese market. This is a vast change from 10
years ago when exports from Japan to the United States were the only cause of
bilateral trade disputes.
     The fact that U.S. companies have resorted to what is basically political
pressure reveals the extent of their desire to grab a share of the colossal
Japanese market. In 1985, when Japanese income levels in dollar terms were
about one-third of present levels, the Japanese market did not have the appeal
that it does today.
     The appearance of more foreign companies will stimulate a structural
change in the Japanese economy. When Toys 'R' Us, a major U.S. toy retailer,
first entered the Japanese market, it touched off a chain reaction of
deregulation in retailing. The many regulations and practices that serve as
nontariff barriers to foreign business will be subject to international
criticism hereafter.

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery

     Editorials Business must lead the way to recovery
     Yomiuri
     Various reports, including one that revealed real gross domestic product
came to minus 2.9 percent in the April-June quarter, indicate the nation's
economy is on rather shaky ground.
     Adding to the gloom was the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey on the
short-term business outlook, known as tankan, which reported in August that
the number of major manufacturing firms that believed the economy was
recovering had dropped by four percentage points.
     An increasing number of companies are revising their business performance
forecasts downward for the current fiscal year.
     All of this is apparently the result of widespread uncertainty over the
prospects of the economy. This uncertainty was created by such factors as the
worsening condition of the semiconductor market, weak employment statistics
and fewer public works projects planned for the months ahead. The planned two
percentage point increase in the consumption tax rate also appears to be a
contributing factor.
     ===
     For better or for worse
     The government, for its part, keeps telling us that the economy is still
recovering. The private sector, however, is divided into pessimistic and
optimistic camps. The former says we are on the verge of economic breakdown,
while the latter maintains we are only experiencing a lull, a temporary
"slackening off."
     There is no denying that the economy is currently at a low point in the
business cycle. The minus growth rate recorded in the April-June quarter,
however, was nothing more than a backlash against the surprisingly high 12.2
percent growth rate recorded during the January-March quarter. In this sense,
the downturn should have been expected, even though the central bank's August
tankan report said that an increasing number of major nonmanufacturing firms
believed that the economy was improving.
     Viewed on a semiannual basis, the nation's economy shrank by 0.2 percent
in real terms during the first half of last year. This compared with 3 percent
growth in the latter half of 1995 and 6.4 percent growth in the first six
months of this year.
     In the 1996 business year, the nation's economy would grow 2.8 percent if
it achieved 0.5 percent on a year-on-year basis during each quarter of the
year, up from a forecast projected by the government. There would be little
cause to complain about that figure if it were not for the fact that Japan--an
economic power that generates about 20 percent of the world's economic
output--is suffering greatly from the impact of massive nonperforming loans
and a sharp decline in land prices in the wake of the collapsed bubble
economy.
     First and foremost, it will be impossible for the nation to again
experience the kind of high economic growth that was recorded year in and year
out during the late '60s and early '70s, when Japan still had a modest
economy. The growth rates seen during the bubble days are also long gone.
     According to statistics on profits, debts, deposits and sales of
corporations, new businesses specializing in such fields as information and
communications are experiencing a boom. Also, the nation's shrinking trade
surplus in recent months indicates Japanese companies are learning to
integrate into the international division of labor, particularly in Asia.
     Five years of recession are changing Japan's economic structure. These
changes should be better explained to the public, which would likely
appreciate the various adjustments that have been made. To put it another way,
recession is the mother of new growth.
     Many politicians have been running around making "pledges" to voters with
the next House of Representatives election just around the corner. Their
promises include freezing the plan to increase the consumption tax or keeping
it where it is, and formulating a large-scale supplementary budget after the
election.
     These reckless moves have destabilized the stock market and discouraged
the business community from going it alone.
     A question can be raised over whether the government, bogged down with
its own massive accumulated deficits of 240 trillion yen, should shoulder even
more financial burden considering the current economic circumstances.
Politicians should stop trying to win support by making irresponsible
proposals. They should instead present the public with programs and practical
methods to turn around the nation's troubled economy.
     ===
     Priorities vs pledges
     The government should also declare that it will shift the focus of its
economic policies. By departing from its emphasis on financial and other
macroeconomic policies, the government should adopt more bread-and-butter
policies such as nurturing new industries, creating more jobs and encouraging
land transactions.
     The most important question, however, is whether private businesses will
seek to go it alone. The nation will not achieve full-scale economic recovery
for good if corporations continue to swing back and forth between optimism and
pessimism with respect to every single economic indicator that comes out.
     The engine of the economy is business, not government. It is about time
companies look for business opportunities in the nation's economy during this
time of historic structural reform. This should serve to restore
entrepreneurship.
     (From Sept. 18 Yomiuri Shimbun)ARF no substitute for U.S.-Japan alliance
     What can be done to ensure peace and security for Japan in the post-Cold
War era?
     One possibility is building a multilateral security framework in Asia
that would allow for the reduction of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa
and other prefectures.
     There is little doubt that a regional security system would contribute to
world peace.
     Nevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that Japan should shift its
security focus--from the Japan-U.S. security treaty to multilateral
arrangements--in the belief that the nation can afford to weaken the bilateral
alliance.
     Any discussion of a regional security framework must start from the right
perspective.
     Considered a harbinger of such a framework is a 19-member forum centering
on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations called the ASEAN Regional Forum
(ARF).
     The ARF, launched in July 1994, seeks to provide a forum for political
and security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region.
     The forum is composed of the seven ASEAN nations and 12 others--Japan,
the United States, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Papua New Guinea, New
Zealand, Laos, the European Union, China, Canada and Australia.
     Proponents of multilateral security arrangements in Asia apparently
expect the ARF to become the Asian version of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
     ===
     European experience
     They say that the ARF should seek to follow the precedent set by European
nations.
     The OSCE succeeded the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
in 1994.
     The CSCE was inaugurated in 1975 when the leaders of 35 countries in
Eastern and Western Europe met in Helsinki to sign a document requiring them
to respect national boundaries.
     There is no doubt that the OSCE is working to build trust among European
countries and cement security in Europe. But it is a far cry from serving as a
framework for collective security. That role has been played by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
     Even such an established organization as the OSCE appears to have a long
way to go before it will be capable of ensuring security in Europe.
     In this regard, it is not realistic to expect the ARF to play such a
role.
     At a conference in May in Canberra concerning security in the
Asia-Pacific region, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said no one
expected the ARF to become a framework for collective defense in the manner of
NATO. He added that no ARF member favored such a development.
     In the next five to 10 years, the key factor for security in Asia will be
alliances between Asian nations and the United States, which are strengthened
by the U.S. military presence in the region.
     The ARF should be used as a forum for dialogue and contacts to complement
that framework.
     ===
     Bilateral pacts come first
     Trust among allies is an important element of any effort to ensure peace
and security. In this sense, Japan must play an active role in promoting the
ARF.
     However, the forum does not replace security pacts signed between the
United States and Asian countries.
     During the Canberra meeting, Downer said the Japan-U.S. relationship was
the most important of all ties between the United States and Asian nations in
ensuring stability in the region.
     Asia faces many potentially destabilizing elements today, including
uncertainties on the Korean Peninsula. To leave no void in the regional
security setup, it is essential that Japan and the United States keep their
alliance intact.
     This is a security foundation that must not be undermined when it comes
to reducing the burden shouldered by Okinawans because of the U.S. military
presence on their islands.

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?

     Trip to waterfront raises question: Is imitation stifling creativity?
Much to t he surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fuk
     Shintaro Kubo
     Yomiuri
     Much to the surprise of many observers, Rinkai Fukutoshin, the waterfront
subcenter constructed on reclaimed land in Tokyo Bay, attracted more visitors
than even nearby Tokyo Disneyland during Golden Week and the summer vacation
period this year.
     Being something of a novelty hunter myself, I visited the waterfront area
immediately after the new Yurikamome transport system went into operation on
Nov. 1 last year.
     But as Yurikamome left the terminal, I had a strong feeling of deja
vu--the landscape outside the window looked extremely familiar. Then it came
to me--it was much like Docklands, the redevelopment area along the Thames in
London's East End, once the center of British shipbuilding during its heyday.
     It was four years ago that I visited Docklands. Having a few spare hours
before my flight back to Japan, I decided to take a look around the area
alone. I rode the subway to the City, then changed to the new transport system
to Docklands. My first stop was the visitor center, where I found, to my great
surprise, a Japanese-language pamphlet on the development area--a clear
indication of how many Japanese visitors were attracted to the area.
     ===
     Imitation of Docklands
     In Britain, the Docklands redevelopment project drew a mixed response,
but my own impression was favorable. I felt the British had done a good job.
     Looking out of the window of Yurikamome, I recalled that experience in
London and thought to myself that the development of Rinkai Fukutoshin was an
imitation of Docklands.
     Metropolitan government officials might well argue that the Tokyo
waterfront project is different because it has many advantages over Docklands.
For example, it uses more sophisticated technology such as its vast central
cooling and heating system. However, I am not convinced the differences are
that great.
     There is also a resemblance between the Rinkai Fukutoshin project and
other waterfront projects overseas. In the United States, a project in
Baltimore, Md., or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, for instance, are very
similar. When I visited those two places I saw crowds of Japanese visitors.
     Other popular spots for Japanese visitors are the huge shopping malls in
the United States, Canada and Britain. One example is the wholesale center in
Milton Keynes, about 60 kilometers north of London. In Japan, commercial
district redevelopment planners have adopted ideas from such overseas
projects.
     ===
     Nation of copycats?
     No doubt this makes our lives more convenient and comfortable, but
thinking about how Japan bases many of its policies on overseas models brought
to mind a remark made by my British assistant when I worked in London as a
correspondent. We had engaged in a heated discussion on the nature of the
Japanese people, which ended when the assistant shouted, "At school, we were
taught that the Japanese imitate everything."
     As soon as I crossed back over the Bay Bridge, I saw cars packing the
roads bumper to bumper and found myself thinking, "This system is crazy. Why
doesn't someone do something about it?"
     It can be said that progress comes from imitation and it cannot be denied
that there is much to be learned from following others, but there are flaws in
the Japanese habit of copying foreign models.
     According to Tohoku University President Junichi Nishizawa, the Japanese
have a strong creative capacity. Japanese inventions and discoveries seem to
prove this, but when it comes to planning large-scale projects, such as
economic reform, this creative spark apparently weakens.
     In the post-Cold War period, Japan is struggling to reform various
domestic systems to adapt to the so-called age of competition.
     ===
     Questions, questions
     Is this because of a belief that we lack the imagination to conceive of
effective plans on our own and have given up trying? Is it because we are now
looking for a suitable foreign model to imitate? Or is it because people in
finance and business are still searching for a way to nurture creative talent?
     Something to mull over perhaps, the next time I ride on the Yurikamome to
Rinkai Fukutoshin.

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis

     Media must sound the cry over national debt crisis
     Kenichi Suematsu
     Yomiuri
     Since July, newspapers have run a number of timely features on fiscal
structural reform--an issue that must be addressed if the Japanese economy is
to be revived.
     The themes of such articles have varied: Newspaper A looked at "The Road
to Fiscal Reform," newspaper B had a piece titled "Dynamics of the
Government's Restructuring Plan and Expenditure Growth," while newspaper C ran
a feature on "Reconstructing Finances--What a Major Debtor Nation Must Do."
     They have also published commentary pieces with various experts outlining
their views on what must be done to solve current fiscal problems, including
concrete proposals on public works projects and agricultural administration.
     As a result of this media coverage, a growing awareness of the critical
fiscal situation and the need for reform is spreading among the population.
     In addition, the government recently issued a white paper on fiscal
reform and announced a plan to thoroughly review government spending. To
demonstrate its determination, the next fiscal year has been designated "the
first year of structural fiscal reform."
     However, it remains true that government ministries and agencies continue
to pursue their own interests in making budget requests for the next fiscal
year.
     The figures are revealing. The current fiscal year shows a government
deficit of 21 trillion yen, with expenditure at 75 trillion yen and income at
only 54 trillion yen. The shortfall is covered by issuing government bonds: in
other words, debt.
     Government spending includes 12 trillion yen in interest payment on bonds
issued in the past. Since the already colossal amount of debt will rise even
further this year, interest payments will be even higher for the next fiscal
year.
     If a company were using more than 20 percent of its annual revenue just
to pay interest on loans, it would consider the situation to be a crisis.
     Yet ministries and agencies--which correspond to divisions of a company--
appear dead set against changing their ways. To protect their vested interests
and justify their work, they continue to submit bigger requests every year.
     The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to adjust budget requests, lacks
the resources to adequately scrutinize whether the money will be well spent.
Instead it appears to distribute money across the board.
     If this were happening in a company, the management would panic, fearing
that the firm could go under. Top executives would implement drastic measures,
such as conducting a thorough review of the company's strategy and
organization, scaling down or even stopping unprofitable operations, cutting
costs to the bone and laying off employees.
     The Cabinet corresponds to management when it comes to national finances.
As such, Cabinet members must exercise the same disciplined leadership as
executives in the private sector. They should order ministries and agencies to
make cuts in inefficient areas of activity, pursue outsourcing, find ways to
lower running costs and, where appropriate, pursue greater efficiency through
privatization. The ministries and agencies would then be forced to get their
accounts in better order.
     Regarding measures to balance the budget, it should be noted that in
recent years the emphasis among the major economies, including the United
States and European nations, has been on cutting expenditures rather than
attaining fiscal reconstruction through tax increases. This is because of a
fear that tax hikes would lead to a decline in international competitiveness
and a hollowing out of industry.
     For instance, the United States and Britain have introduced systems to
control and cap government spending, while many European nations have
imple-mented severe cuts in their social security programs. Welfare spending
is an act of kindness in the short term, but ultimately leaves a negative
legacy for future generations.
     Compared to the austerity measures taken by other nations, I cannot help
but feel that Japan has shown a lack of determination in the way that it has
addressed fiscal reform.
     A general election, expected soon, is likely to further dampen enthusiasm
for reform. There is a growing concern that pressure to increase spending on
public works projects will increase as the fight for votes heats up.
     Therefore I want to take this opportunity to express hope that the media
will make an extra effort to explain to the people as simply and plainly as
possible how the disparity between revenue and expenditure is a cause for
great national concern.
     I suggest they use the metaphor of a company's balance of accounts to
show who will benefit from social security and who will pay. Then they should
ask the public to judge whether the government's welfare programs should be
continued, expanded or reduced.
     Raising public awareness of the crisis is an indispensable first step
toward eliminating vested interests in government and can provide the impetus
for the bold policy changes that are needed.
     It must also be made clear that if we are spendthrifts today, then we
will have to pay the consequences tomorrow.
     For example, public works projects in construction and agriculture often
do not increase productivity or international competitiveness. In fact, it is
widely recognized that such projects have sometimes led to increases in
utility rates and the price of farm products.
     If information concerning the cost-effectiveness of public works were
disclosed, taxpayers would be able to judge whether such projects are
worthwhile. The same can be said of state funding for moribund
government-affiliated corporations.
     If the public were told in clear and simple terms how their taxes are
being spent, I believe there would be a national chorus for reform, which in
turn would create enough momentum to overcome administrative inertia.
     Of course, such a disclosure would mean that the public would have to
make tough choices about spending priorities, which they have been shielded
from in the past. But, for the first time, this would mean that political
parties would no longer have to try to win votes by making policy pledges that
the nation later comes to regret. In this sense, a more open economic policy
would be a step toward politics that truly reflects the will of the people.

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies

     U.S. candidates big on TV, short on policies
     Masashi Iiyama
     Yomiuri
     WASHINGTON--With Labor Day on Sept. 2 over, campaigning for the U.S.
presidential election has entered the final heat. During the next two months
until polling day on Nov. 5, every movement of Democratic candidate President
Bill Clinton and Republican candidate Bob Dole will be watched and analyzed.
     But it is still unclear what the main issues are. There has yet to be a
"great debate," as Clinton put it, between the two candidates.
     The only sign of action was U.S. missile strikes against Iraq, which
suddenly occurred in the midst of campaigning. This move worked
over-whelmingly in favor of the president.
     A public opinion poll showed that 79 percent of the public supported the
strikes. Dole, who made a critical remark immediately after the attacks, was
eventually forced to express support for them. This, however, fell far short
of a heated debate on political issues.
     Meanwhile, the Democratic and Republican national conventions in August
were political shows aimed at television and followed well-planned scripts.
     The main performers were movie star Christopher Reeve, who has been
paralyzed from the neck down since falling off a horse, and a downed U.S.
pilot who survived in Bosnia by eating weeds.
     Between speeches, singers went on stage and sang one song after another.
Shops selling caps and T-shirts with the candidates' names were crowded with
delegates from across the country.
     At the Democratic convention, Clinton proposed a 1,500 dollars tax credit
for college tuition, a system to encourage young people to purchase homes,
introduction of uniforms in public schools and a curfew for children.
     These mini-initiatives--which one might expect from candidates for
municipal assemblies or local education boards--were in response to everyday
concerns and complaints from the public. However, they hardly seemed
appropriate in a campaign by a U.S. president who hopes to lead the world
community in the 21st century.
     Meanwhile, Dole proposed a 15 percent across-the-board income tax cut,
claiming it would boost economic growth and benefit both the government and
the public.
     His overly optimistic policy, however, gave the impression that he had
switched from a long-held emphasis on balanced national finances to a generous
offer of money to voters.
     So far, apart from the tax-cut proposal, there is no major difference
between the policies of the two candidates.
     Now that election consultants manage campaigns on the basis of opinion
polls, presidential candidates form policies to reflect the majority view.
     With the end of the Cold War, the United States has lost its arch rival,
the Soviet Union. This may be another factor behind the lack of dynamism in
the U.S. presidential race.
     The two candidates are proposing policies in areas in which the public is
keenly interested, such as education, employment and crime, while foreign
policy hardly appears--except for the missile strikes against Iraq.
     Domestically, the massive cumulative budget deficit of 5 trillion dollars
makes it difficult for the candidates to put forward policies requiring large
budget spending-- another reason why Clinton is proposing low-cost
mini-initiatives.
     However, the candidates are stressing moral standards. A typical example
is repeated calls for the restoration of "family values"--a term voiced many
times at both parties' conventions as though it were the conferences' main
slogan.
     In the United States, the number of families headed by single mothers is
soaring, in particular among the poor and blacks, and such families account
for nearly one-fourth of all households in the country.
     Single mothers with small children are unable to work and depend on
welfare benefits for years. The number of recipients is now 14 million,
equivalent to the population of a medium-sized nation. This expansion has
resulted in problems for the country's welfare programs.
     As Uncle Sam moves toward a smaller government, it will become more
difficult to maintain existing welfare programs, and how to sustain
single-parent families will become an even more serious problem.
     Despite this gloomy outlook, Clinton has proposed tiny steps to restore
"family values," calling on business to hire more people on welfare and on
parents to read more books to their children.
     The question is whether this preaching, done on behalf of clergymen, will
be effective in reforming U.S. society.
     There is a danger that it may merely sound comforting to the voters'
ears. All that can be done is to wait and see.

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan

     Helping Palestinians--perfect diplomatic role for Japan
     Tsuneo Sugishita
     Yomiuri
     The government's promise of a 3 million dollars emergency aid package to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, who was in Japan last week, is widely
seen as an attempt to kick-start the stalled Middle East peace process.
     Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with Arafat and said Japan would
extend aid through the United Nations Development Program to help create jobs
for Palestinians.
     Japan has played an active role in promoting the peace process,
announcing aid measures as early as 1993, two years before Israel and the
Palestinian side signed the accord on Palestinian self-rule.
     In September 1993, then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told the U.N.
General Assembly that Japan planned to offer up to 2 million dollars over a
two-year period to the Palestinians.
     Since then, it has earmarked official development assistance to help fund
the Palestinian economic committee on development and reconstruction, and for
projects such as the construction of houses for Palestinian police officers
and the purchase of computers for police.
     Former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited the Palestinian area in
Gaza in September last year, just before the self-rule accord was signed. He
announced a plan to begin direct aid, in addition to the indirect assistance
Japan had already been giving through international organizations.
     Japan's direct aid for fiscal 1996-97 comes to 41.65 million dollars,
including medical equipment, teaching materials for higher education and a
plan to construct a hospital in Jericho.
     Thus far, including money given through international organizations,
Japan has extended more than 200 million dollars in aid to the Palestinians,
making it the largest donor nation.
     The emergency aid that Hashimoto announced is to be used for job creation
projects in Khan Yunis, a city suffering acute unemployment as a result of the
economic blockade imposed by Israel after a terrorist incident in March.
     Hashimoto also pledged to send a study mission to the Palestinian
self-rule area that will provide farm machinery, chemicals and fertilizer to
increase food production.
     Japan's active role in the Middle East stems from self-interest, notably
the hope that peace in the region will lead to a stable and long-term energy
supply.
     It is also a good opportunity for Japan to make the international
contribution that is expected of it as a major economic power.
     The central principle of Japan's Middle East policy is that peace will
only take root if the area's residents can lead stable lives. This requires
economic development, hence the continuing growth of Japanese economic
cooperation through ODA.
     On the Palestinian side, there are great expectations of Japan. Arafat
has repeatedly pointed out the importance of Japan's role in promoting peace
in the Middle East.
     Japan has several advantages in its involvement in the region. There is
no major historical distrust between Japan and the Middle East and so Japanese
aid is accepted more readily.
     Furthermore, while other advanced nations such as the United States and
those in Europe are suffering from donor fatigue, Japan shows no signs of
that. There is fairly widespread support in Japan for extending assistance to
the Middle East.
     Of course, there are obstacles. The biggest problem is that the peace
process has stalled since the election of a hard-line Israeli government under
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     The effectiveness of Japanese assistance in a region facing such
destabilizing factors is unclear.
     The construction of bridges and roads linking the Palestinian self-rule
area to Jordan and other countries would be an important step forward.
However, there is no precedent for a Japanese ODA project involving two or
more nations simultaneously. Japan is faced with the technical problem of how
to work out such new forms of ODA.
     However, the momentum started by Japan's assistance to the Palestinians
cannot be slowed. For many years the Middle East was a central stage for
European diplomatic activity--now it offers opportunities for Japan to enhance
its international profile.
     It is to be hoped that Japan's policy on the Palestinians will be driven
by independent initiatives and not merely follow the priorities of U.S.
diplomacy.@:

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up

     Taiheiyo Bank successor starts up
     Yomiuri
     Wakashio Bank, successor to the failed Taiheiyo Bank, launched operations
on Tuesday as a regional bank based in Tokyo.
     Wakashio Bank was set up with investment from four major commercial
banks. It has assets of 671 billion yen and deposits of 450 billion yen.
     Sakura Bank supplied the entire capital of 40 billion yen, while Fuji
Bank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank extended subordinated loans totaling about 93
billion yen.
     The new bank has 42 branch offices in Tokyo, Kawasaki (Kanagawa
Prefecture), Yokohama, Ichikawa (Chiba Prefecture) and Urawa (Saitama
Prefecture) and 945 employees.
     Before starting business, a ceremony was held at the bank's head office
in Jimbocho, Chiyoda Ward, attended by top executives including President
Hiroyasu Ichikawa.
     Ichikawa addressed the staff saying he wanted to see the bank grow
soundly, fully aware of its public mission as a regional bank.
     Then a decorative paper ball was burst to celebrate the start of the new
bank.

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams

     Tax agency gets tough on transfer pricing scams
     Yomiuri
     Tax authorities imposed a transfer-pricing tax in 44 cases involving 49.2
billion yen in income for the year to June 1996, an official said on Tuesday.
     This is a new record for the National Tax Administration Agency since the
tax began in 1987.
     The transfer-pricing tax is a penalty surtax imposed when a company
manipulates the value of transactions with overseas subsidiaries to conceal
taxable income.
     There are similar systems in Western countries including the United
States.
     During the past nine years, the agency has imposed a transfer-pricing tax
in 130 cases, involving what is believed to be 194.8 billion yen moved
overseas to evade taxes.
     The figures, which show a third of cases and a quarter of the value
occurred in the most recent of the nine years, indicate the advances the
agency has made in detecting transfer pricing.
     A company found guilty of moving income can request a consultation
between the tax agency and its foreign counterparts to avoid double taxation.
     If the consultation is successful, the company can obtain a refund of
part of the tax paid, in one or both of the countries.
     Out of the 130 cases, more than 10 have been settled with foreign
consultation, while consultations are being held in 31 other cases.
     There are also cases where foreign taxation authorities have imposed a
transfer-pricing tax on the foreign subsidiaries of Japanese companies.
     Because it usually takes a long time to settle cases and companies have
to bear a heavy financial burden until settlement, "a prior confirmation
system" was set up in 1987 to enable companies to confirm with the tax agency
the proper value of goods bought and sold between the parent company and its
overseas subsidiaries.
     The agency received 42 inquiries under this system during the year to
June 1996.

     Premium diesel fuels competition

     Premium diesel fuels competition
     Yomiuri
     Competition among oil companies for diesel fuel sales has intensified as
sports-utility vehicless have gained popularity and as sales in general have
dropped following import liberalization in April.
     The industry is suffering reduced sales and dramatically lower gasoline
prices since the liberalization.
     Nippon Oil and Mitsubishi Oil, two major wholesalers, are trying to
expand distribution channels with the aim of boosting their lines of "premium"
diesel fuel, which contains additives to improve fuel efficiency, according to
sources.
     Kygnus Sekiyu K.K. also plans to market premium diesel fuel as early as
this week.
     There are high expectations in the industry for premium diesel fuel
because most RVs have diesel engines. Industry sources also expect higher
prices for the premium fuel to bring higher returns.
     Premium diesel fuel burns more efficiently than regular diesel, giving
more kilometers per liter. It also is more efficient in staring a diesel
engine on cold days and reduces exhaust pollutants.
     Regular gasoline prices began falling two years ago in anticipation of
liberalization. In August 1994, regular gasoline averaged 120 yen a liter, in
August 1995, 113, yen and this August, 105. yen
     The first premium diesel, Nisseki proG, was introduced in 1993. Its
retail price is now about 8 yen a liter higher than regular diesel fuel, which
averages 81 yen per liter.
     Nisseki plans to expand gas stations dealing in the product from 300 to
1,000 by the year 2000.
     Mitsubishi started marketing its "RV Diesel" in August 1995. Company
sources said it was selling 14 million liters a month, far exceeding the
initial projection of three million liters. It is priced 3 yen to 5 yen above
regular diesel.
     The company plans to have 1,000 of its gas stations marketing the product
by the end of October, doubling the current 500.
     Kygnus will test-market its version of the product in six gas stations in
Kanto and Nagoya regions from this month until next March.
     After analyzing customer feedback, it expects to start full-fledged
distribution next April, according to company sources.
     Premium diesel fuel is said to be cost efficient because it is made by
simply adding chemicals to regular diesel and can be priced higher. Some view
it as the savior of a hard-hit industry.
     On the downside, however, the product requires new investment such as
separate storage facilities and separate vehicles for transportation.
     Because of this, the other oil wholesalers remain cautious about
introducing the product and are waiting to see how the other three fare.
     But one of the other major wholesalers "might follow suit if the three
companies perform well," according to a company source.

     economic perspective

     economic perspective
     Onoue
     Yomiuri
     Annual quotas for five types of fish and one type of crab will be applied
in Japanese waters, starting Jan. 1 next year, according to an official at the
Fisheries Ministry. The planned quota system, aimed at long-term preservation
of marine resources, is based on the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea,
which the Diet ratified last July.
     For the time being, current hauls will be used to set quotas, the
official said. However, the new measure is expected to have far-reaching
consequences for fishermen and consumers, since the agency is set gradually to
introduce quotas for other types of fish and also to revise quotas each year,
based upon the extent to which fishing resources are being depleted.
     The six species subject to quotas from the beginning of next year are
mackerel, Alaska pollock, saury, horse mackerel, pilchard and snow crab. At
first, the agency had considered imposing quotas on 10 types of marine
creatures but four were dropped because, according to one agency official, the
six had a higher priority for preservation, and their fishing was considered
easier to manage and verify,
     Nevertheless, catches of the six totaled 2.57 million tons in 1994, about
half of the entire fishing haul around the Japanese archipelago.
     The U.N. convention states that a country can impose an economic zone
within 200 nautical miles of its coast, within which it can exercise the
exclusive right to fish and develop marines resources. However, if a nation
establishes such a zone, international law obliges it to impose fishing quotas
to preserve and manage marine resources. Japan's move to introduce quotas is
in line with these requirements.
     The agency explained the criteria it had used for selecting which fish
would be subject to quotas: first, those subject to intensive fishing and
bearing high economic value; second, those whose stocks are heavily depleted
and in urgent need of preservation and fishing management; and third, those
caught in waters around Japan, not only by domestic fishing boats, but also by
foreign vessels.
     The agency plans to determine the exact quota for each of the six fish
before the end of October, after which it will inform each prefecture of its
allotment. To minimize the impact on fishermen's quotas in the first year will
be almost the same as current catches, according to the agency official.
     However, the depletion of these species is already a serious matter. In
recent years the catch of Alaska pollock has dropped to one-tenth of its peak
of 3 million tons, while hauls of snow crabs have fallen to one-fourth of
their peak of 24,000 tons.
     The sharp drop in catches is attributed to overfishing, which has
depleted marine resources in Japanese waters.
     The agency is concerned with the situation and from the second year if
plans gradually to lower quotas for those fish whose stocks are the worse
depleted .
     The agency is also well aware that introducing strict quotas will hit the
income of fishermen and may leave some facing financial difficulties. Thus it
is considering requesting extra spending in the fiscal 1998 budget to provide
support, such as low-interest loans and subsidies.
     If fish hauls drop as a result of the new quotas, prices may raise, which
would hit consumers. The agency, however, maintained that the new measure is
in the long-term interest of consumers. "It is clear that continued
overfishing will lead to further falls in the volume of catches. Managed
fishing will help to maintain and nurture marine resources and create a stable
supply of fish to consumers," an agency official said.
     To impose quotas, the agency will eventually have to order fishermen to
report their hauls on a regular basis and punish those whose catches are in
excess of limits. However, the planned quotas will not be binding until the
nation's bilateral fishing agreements with South Korea and China are revised,
said the agency official.
     Japan introduced a 200-mile fishing zone in 1977, but South Korea and
China are exempt from this restriction because of existing bilateral
agreements.
     Under current arrangements boats in the zone are supervised by their
country of origin. Therefore, as long as the present agreements remain intact,
fishing boats belonging to South Korea and China are outside the Japanese
government's jurisdiction even if they fish inside the zone.
     Applying quotas only for Japanese fishing boats would be unfair and an
ineffective way to reduce hauls, said the agency official.
     To rectify the situation, the government is urging its two neighbors to
revise the existing agreements so that Japan can exercise authority over any
fishing boat, regardless of nationality, within its 200-mile fishing zone.

     okura reform

     okura reform
     Yomiuri
     A ruling coalition task force discussing reform of the Finance Ministry
has set Thursday as its deadline to come up with the coalition's unified
proposal, despite apparent discord among its member parties.
     The deadline was set Tuesday, when the task force decided to present the
coalition's proposal when it meets again on Thursday, according to sources
close to the team.
     However, political observers question whether the three ruling
parties--the Liberal Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and New Party
Sakigake (Pioneers)--will be able to smooth over their difference on this
sensitive issue by Thursday.
     The LDP and SDP, the two largest parties in the coalition, are united in
principle on a two-pillar plan.
     Under the plan, the ministry's three key bureaus--securities, banking,
and international finance--would be merged into two bureaus dealing with
finance and international affairs, while its banking and finance inspection
function would be separated from the ministry and be taken over by a new body
attached to the ministry.
     Sakigake, on the other hand, is demanding more drastic reform through
complete separation between its functions in dealing with fiscal and financial
affairs.
     The LDP and SDP have given up on a plan to separate the supervising
function from the ministry, because it would involve other ministries, such as
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, which, according to LDP and
SDP sources, would face insurmountable obstacles.
     Presently the ministry has three fundamental functions concerning
financial administration: drafting policies, inspecting and supervising banks
and securities houses.
     The LDP and SDP are calling for the inspection function to go to a new
organization whose jurisdiction would cover not only banks but also
agricultural cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions.
     Under the LDP-SDP proposal, the organization would be affiliated with the
ministry and subject to the provision of Clause 8 of the National Government
Organization Law.
     Some coalition members had also called for the application of the law's
Clause 3 to the proposed organization so as to give it more independence from
the ministry.
     However, the two parties eventually backed down, because this would
require a drastic reform of the ministry, including its local inspection
sections, which LDP and SDP sources say is practically impossible.
     Nevertheless, the LDP-SDP proposal attempts to reinforce the independence
of a new body by designating the prime minister, not the finance minister, as
the supreme authority in appointing its head.

     R.A. McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is

     R.A. McDonald, president of P&G Far East P&G's commitment to Kobe is part
of o ne to Japan and the world
     Ikuo Anai
     Yomiuri
     Kobe
     According to your personal history, you graduated from the U.S. Army
academy West Point in 1975--the year the Vietnam War ended. Five years later,
you left the military and joined Procter & Gamble. Can you tell me what you
did in the military and why you left?
     McDonald: It's a requirement that you serve in the army for five years
after graduating from West Point. I served primarily with the 82nd Airborne
Division as an infantry officer. It's a parachute unit.
     Did you think of leaving the military early on?
     No, not really. I found it fine to be an army officer. But over time I
met my wife and I went to an MBA program (at Utah State University). I then
decided that my goal had changed and this led me to private industry.
     I'd like to take (the fall of) the Berlin Wall as an example. When I went
to West Point, I thought that would happen because the military creates
freedom for people in other countries. But the reality is that businesses
create freedom. People in East Germany wanted Levi's jeans and BMWs that
people in West Germany had. That made the wall come down--not really a battle.
     So, in some way, global business plays an important role in liberating
people. Look at China. One could argue--at least the U.S. government would
argue--that engaging China has resulted in more progress than in isolating
China. That's probably the future trend of the world.
     I think that is already an ongoing trend as many multinational companies,
including your company, have already started operations in many developing
countries such as China.
     I think so. We have quite large operations in China and employ a lot of
Chinese people. In fact, we have many of those Chinese people working right
now in this building--our regional technical center.
     P&G Far East is not a public company so it isn't obliged to divulge
information about sales.
     That's right. But I can tell you about total global company results if
you are interested. As of June 30 this year, we announced record annual
earnings of more than 3 billion dollars. That's the first time that we made
more than 3 billion dollars in profit--a 15 percent increase over the previous
year. Actual worldwide net sales were 35.28 billion dollars, up 5 percent.
Again, that's the first time that we have ever made more than 35 billion
dollars.
     It's not surprising that each of our four regions--North America, Europe,
Latin America and Asia--showed record volumes and record results. Asia
accounted for about 4 billion dollars of that 35 billion dollars--actually
3.79 billion dollars--and that was a 5 percent increase.
     How about results in Japan?
     We don't refer to Japan separately. But we would say that no matter how
good the result is, we want to do better. The presence of this building--a
technical center and our Asian headquarters--is evidence of our commitment to
Japan and of the importance of Japan not only in Asia but really to our global
business.
     The way we like to think about it is that the Japanese consumer is one of
the most critical and most discerning in the world. The Japanese consumer can
see product differences that other consumers often miss. We use the capability
of the Japanese consumer and the tough competition we have here in Japan to
not only improve our products in Japan but improve our products globally.
     Let me give you some examples. You may know that we introduced the
dish-washing detergent called Joy in 1995 and it became the market leader in a
relatively short period of time. It was formulated differently (from a
comparable product in the United States) because habits are different in
Japan.
     In North America, consumers put dish-washing liquid in sinks, fill them
with water and create a solution. In Japan, consumers put drops of
dish-washing liquid on a sponge and then wash with it.
     In hair care, we also have to formulate differently. Japanese, and Asian,
hair is six times the diameter of Caucasian hair. If you understand geometry,
the larger the diameter is, the more surface area you have and the more
conditioning you need.
     I understand that in the early years of its operations in Japan, P&G
simply brought U.S. products to Japan.
     That's correct. And they failed.
     When did your company actually realize there were differences in consumer
tastes?
     I don't remember the exact year, but it was maybe 1985, with a program we
called "Ichidai Hiyaku."
     Meaning a great leap forward?
     Exactly. We really got focused on creating products in Japan for Japanese
consumers. That led to better business growth.
     We now want to go a step further and use the Japanese consumer to help us
innovate products for the rest of the world. That's the reason you see this
building here.
     You know many, many foreign companies are going to places like Singapore
and Hong Kong. We purposely chose to come to Japan.
     Let me ask you about the impact on your company of the bearish state of
the Japanese economy in the wake of the economic bubble. You are lucky because
your arrival coincided with the very beginning of a recovery.
     Is it recovering? (laughter)
     Did your company suffer any adverse effects from the collapse of the
bubble economy? Many Japanese companies blame it for their poor performance.
     I think that of a number of issues, the most critical to me is (that) we
need to...get the economy growing again.
     From our company's standpoint, we are trying to increase the rate of
innovation in our products. I don't think the Japanese consumer has become any
less desirous of quality products or better value.
     In fact, consumers have become even tougher--tougher judges. We know that
if we innovate in our products and if we give them a product that truly is
superior, they buy it. That's a challenge.
     I have read an awful lot about price destruction after the bubble
economy. In some ways, price destruction is our own fault. As we look at some
(of our) behavior as a company, we have found that many things that we did may
have exacerbated and perpetuated price destruction.
     Some of these things have perhaps hurt the consumer more than helped the
consumer. We have a strategy worldwide that we call ECR or efficient consumer
response. ECR is the idea that you focus on specific consumer needs and give
the consumers what they want and eliminate all non-value-added activity.
     In Japan, as you know, sometimes when you go shopping, you can find a
certain product at one store at 200 yen and at another store at 1,200. yen As
a consumer, you immediately register in your mind: What's going on? Why is
there such a price disparity?
     This is because the situation is not transparent. The consumer doesn't
understand the value of the products that they are buying. We want to create a
transparent environment--an environment where the consumer can buy a product
because of the product performance, the position of advertising and
variants--no deception...By eliminating all the inefficiencies in supplying
products, we can be the lowest price every day.
     When I spoke with a New York fund manager the other day, he said he
favors household product manufacturers like yourself because their stock
prices are not so vulnerable to the cyclical changes in the economy--the
consumer needs your products anyway regardless of the prevailing economic
conditions. Is this observation correct?
     Let me tell you the way we look at it. Our company's job is to increase
total shareholder value. In order to measure our performance, we actually
measure ourselves against many other companies in our industry. And we'd like
to be in the top of that measurement.
     Total shareholder value includes things like stock-price appreciation and
dividends. A consumer goods stock is good to hold in a bearish market. Procter
& Gamble in the last three years actually has been at the top of the industry.
As a result, we've seen an exponential increase in the share price. We hope we
will be able to keep that up.
     We believe it is very important for the employees to feel that they are
the owners of the company.
     Procter & Gamble believes very deeply that the interests of its employees
and the company are inseparable. As a result, here in Japan in August, we gave
each employee stock in P&G.
     Was that stock offer the first of its kind?
     Yes, the first time. Again it demonstrates our commitment to people. The
idea is to increase the feeling of their ownership of the company.
     P&G has been in Japan for 23 years. Do you think this is long enough to
achieve a solid customer base that can generate earnings automatically without
pouring an enormous amount of money into advertising?
     That's a great question. The interesting thing about Japan, as I told you
before, is that the Japanese consumer is discerning. As a result of that, in
Japan, you win big or you lose big.
     There really is no in-between. If you develop a superior product like
Joy, you win very big. But if you have a product that is inferior, you can
lose very big.
     So I don't think that there are any automatic earnings or automatic
market share in Japan.
     I would say of all the countries I worked in--I worked in many and am
familiar with our business all over the world--in this country, you have to be
working hard every single day to satisfy the consumer. Otherwise, you lose.
     Part of that is the consumer and part of it is the competition, because
the competition is working hard every day.
     We have Kao-san (Kao Corp.), Lion-san (Lion Corp.) and Uni-Charm as our
competitors here in Japan. I am afraid that even if we are here for a century,
there will be nothing like automatic earnings.

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd

     Taka stays perfect; Akebono loses 2nd
     Yomiuri
     Yokozuna Takanohana maintained his hold on first place and a perfect
record, defeating No. 3 maegashira Tamakasuga on the 10th day of the Autumn
Grand Sumo Tournament at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan on Tuesday.
     Takanohana (10-0) was sent sliding backwards by the maegashira's initial
charge, but quickly righted himself, and turned the momentum rapidly in his
direction to push out Tamakasuga (4-6).
     Yokozuna Akebono suffered his second loss of the basho when he was thrown
down by No. 1 maegashira Asahiyutaka.
     The two rikishi had to wrestle twice, after the judges called for a
rematch when the first bout ended in confusion.
     Akebono (8-2) appeared to have lost when he inadvertently stepped out of
the dohyo while trying to apply the final shove to Asahiyutaka (7-3).
     Akebono had a solid two-hand belt hold on the maegashira at the time and
had him toeing the straw, when he accidentally stepped out with his right foot
as Asahiyutaka struggled to stave off the yokozuna.
     Television replays clearly showed that the yokozuna had indeed stepped
out first, but after a lengthy discussion, the judges ordered the pair to
wrestle again.
     Ozeki Takanonami had to muster all his energy to avoid defeat at the
hands of sekiwake Kaio, leaving both wrestlers at 7-3.
     Kaio shot off the mark and stood the ozeki up, gaining a two-hand belt
grip in the process. The sekiwake moved the ozeki near the edge of the circle,
before Takanonami finally fought off the charge and quickly turned the tables
and lifted Kaio out.
     Ozeki Wakanohana fought off an aggressive effort from No. 2 maegashira
Kotoinazuma (3-7) to bag his kachikoshi eighth victory.
     Wakanohana stood firm in the face of the maegashira's repeated slaps and
thrust, weathering the storm until he could wear down the maegashira and push
him out of the dohyo.
     Ozeki Musashimaru got his kachikoshi by prevailing over No. 1 maegashira
Akinoshima (3-7) in a bout that lasted just a split-second.
     Akinoshima tried to fire off the tachi-ai at a low angle, hoping to knife
in underneath the ozeki, but Musashimaru reacted quickly to foil the
maegashira's plan.
     Musashimaru extended both arms to steady himself by touching the
maegashira's shoulders, then quickly pulled Akinoshima down by the back of the
neck.
     Sekiwake Takatoriki (5-5) dominated komusubi Kotonowaka (1-9) in a short
affair. Takatoriki took charge of the match from the outset, using a left-hand
smash to the throat of the komusubi to pave the way to victory.
     Takatoriki kept his hand on Kotonowaka's throat, then moved in and got a
belt-hold, which he used to twist the komusubi around in a circle before
pushing him out.
     Komusubi Musoyama benefitted from some carelessness on the part of No. 2
maegashira Kenko (1-9) for his sixth win .
     Kenko came off the tachi-ai with the advantage, forcing the komusubi
backward with a succession of slaps to the face. However, just as the
maegashira moved in to finish Musoyama off, he allowed the komusubi to grab
his arms at the exact moment his body was extended in a precarious position.
     Musoyama seized the opportunity, and moved to the side and pulled the
maegashira down.
     Komusubi Kotonishiki (8-2) made short work of No. 5 maegashira Daishoho
(5-5).
     The agile komusubi employed a combination of good hand and footwork to
get himself behind the maegashira and push him out.
     Flying off the mark, Kotonishiki kept himself out of Daishoho's reach
while simultaneously applying deft blows to the shoulders and back of the
maegashira to put himself in position for the win.
     No. 3 maegashira Kotobeppu (1-9) finally got in the win column by scoring
a victory over No. 4 maegashira Konishiki (5-5).
     The two heavyweights bashed into each other repeatedly, before Kotobeppu
got Konishiki off-balance, then used his ample stomach to move the larger
Konishiki backward over the straw.
     No. 7 maegashira Minatofuji threw down No. 4 maegashira Kitakachidoki
(2-8) with a one-hand belt grip to garner his fourth win of the tournament.
     Minatofuji (4-7) quickly gained a hold on Kitakachidoki's mawashi and
then lifted him in the air and flipped him over.
     No. 6 maegashira Aogiyama (4-6) forced out No. 5 maegashira Asanowaka
(3-7).

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup

     Ohio State men swing into lead of Topy Cup
     Yomiuri
     TANAGURA, Fukushima
     The Ohio State University men's golf team shot a collective 5-under-par
Tuesday to lead the team competition of the Topy Cup U.S.-Japan
Intercollegiate Golf Championship at the Tanagura Country Club.
     The U.S. squad is followed by Senshu University at 3-under-par and
defending champion Nihon University at 1-over.
     Ohio State senior Chris Wollmann, who made the cut at the U.S. Amateur
Championship in August, shot a team high a 3-under-par 105 at the par-72
course 7,050-yard course.
     "I hit a lot of greens and my putting was very good," said Wollmann, who
admires Greg Norman and plans to turn pro next year. "I can make more birdies
if I putt well tomorrow."
     Another Ohio State senior, Didier De Vooght, played aggressively on the
hilly course. "I used my driver every hole except the short holes," he said.
     The Belgian golfer, whose driving distance averages 280-290 yards, won
the Belgian Amateur Championship in August. He will represent his country in
the World Amateur Cup this fall.
     The Ohio State team is among six U.S. teams, including Clemson
University, University of New Mexico and San Jose State University.
     The tournament, which uses five-man teams, takes the four lowest scores
in each group and totals them after 54 holes to decide the team champion. The
individual championship will be decided by the lowest 54 hole score.

     So Taguchi homered and had two RBIs and Junichi Fukura added a pair of
RBIs in the win for the BlueWave.
     Willie Fraser won his ninth game of the season for Orix, scattering five
hits and one run in five innings on the mound.
     Hawks' starter Kimiyasu Kudo (8-14) took the loss allowing all six runs
on eight hits in 62/3 innings.
     Hiroki Kokubo and Arihito Muramatsu had RBIs for the losers.
     In another Pacific League game:
     Marines 6, Buffaloes 5: Iwao Omura went 3-for-4 with a home run and three
RBIs as Chiba Lotte edged Kintetsu at Fujiidera Stadium.

     The win moved the Giants back to within one game of the first-place
Hiroshima Carp in the race for the CL flag.
     The Giants pounded out 15 hits off seven Yokohama pitchers, including
solo home runs by Daisuke Motoki and Shinichi Murata.
     Takashi Saito (9-9) started and took the loss for the BayStars, getting
pelted for five runs on six hits in 41/3 innings.

     Kazuya Tabata (11-11) gave up four runs on six hits in 72/3 innings but
got the win for the Swallows.
     Tomoaki Kanemoto hit his 26th homer, a three-run shot, in the loss for
the Carp.
     Shinya Miyamoto also homered for the Swallows.

WORLD BANK'S PLANS FOR BOSNIA

The World Bank has unveiled what it calls an integrated approach to
reconstruction in Bosnia that envisages spending no less than $4.8bn to
rebuild a devastated country.  The bank's president, James Wolfensohn,
listed 10 major project components for the three year programme to run
from January 1996.  These are: water and sanitation ($380m); energy -
to include power, district heating, natural gas distribution and coal
($893m); transport ($698m); telecommunications ($567m); agriculture and
rural reconstruction ($330m); industry ($400m); education ($275m);
health ($540m); housing ($600m); and mine-clearing ($200m).

Extent of destruction.  The programme is needed to cope with the
destruction or serious damage of two-thirds of the country's housing
stock, half of its schools and colleges, and one-third of its health
facilities, Mr Wolfensohn told the London Conference on Peace
Implementation in December.  It was also necessary to wean ordinary
Bosnians back into economic life.  At present, nine out of 10 are
dependent on humanitarian assistance, whilst family incomes are
averaging one-quarter of their pre-war level.

Donor meeting.  The programme will have to be financed by a variety of
bilateral and international groups.  Mr Wolfensohn said that the IMF
and the central banks of key potential donor countries are backing the
programme.  The Netherlands is expected to play a major role in hosting
a donors' conference in the next few weeks.  The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is currently preparing major
projects in the power, telecommunications and transport sectors.

EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere says technical missions have made
preliminary assessments and that detailed project preparation studies
have been defined.  The EBRD, he said, "is considering both equity and
loan instruments, oriented to channel resources efficiently to Bosnian
enterprises."  Mr de Larosiere stated that Bosnia would require
significant levels of concessional funding.  Both bank presidents
stressed the need for a dual approach: the revitalisation of local
enterprises - which often amounts to the establishment or encouragement
of private sector enterprise in an economy still dominated by the state
- along with the physical reconstruction of key infrastructure.
Palestinian experience.  The World Bank has learned from its experience
in the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza that if such an
ambitious reconstruction programme is to get off the ground, then
concrete aid proposals will have to be formulated - and implemented -
very quickly indeed.  In this context, it has already begun
implementing a priority three month programme to run from January 1 to
March 31 1996, which Mr Wolfensohn estimates will require between $550m
and $600m.  At a meeting in Brussels in December, the Bank, the
European Commission and the EBRD held an initial meeting of donor
countries and agencies to set out a comprehensive reconstruction
programme and mobilise short-term commitments.

Mr Wolfensohn has already committed the bank to contributing a
significant part of this short term financing, whilst the European
Union, the Islamic Conference Organisation and individual European and
Islamic states are putting the finishing touches to contributions that
should ensure the initial programme is fully funded.

In stressing an integrated approach to reconstruction, Mr Wolfensohn
and other potential donors have stressed that they will take into
account humanitarian and human rights issues as well as those of
practical reconstruction.  It seems likely that a number of significant
major projects will be initiated in 1996, not least in terms of the
restoration of basic services in Sarajevo and other major cities.  But
it is impossible to predict what will happen in 1997 in view of the
fact that the American-led military implementation force is supposed to
complete its mission at the end of 1996, thus potentially removing one
of the key pillars of day-to-day security in Bosnia.

Political strings.  In addition, the US has made it very clear that
reconstruction comes with tough political strings.  "Reconstruction
funds are not a right.  Those who fail to comply with the Dayton
Agreement should not expect our help; those who do not co-operate with
the War Crimes Tribunal should not expect to receive the benefits of
economic and financial assistance," the US ambassador to the UN,
Madeleine Albright, told the London conference.

EBRD LOOKS TO BOSNIA

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is predicting an
"explosion" of investment funds in war-torn former Yugoslavia, once the
peace settlement takes hold in the emerging patchwork of states.  A co-
author (along with the European Union) of the region's nascent $3bn -
$4bn World Bank-led reconstruction programme, the EBRD is to undertake
the rebuilding of the financial sector in order to "mobilise domestic
and foreign capital".

The government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has already
applied for full membership of the international financial
institutions.  But this has been held up pending a settlement of the
issue of outstanding debt obligations of the former Yugoslavia.  The
peace agreement means, however, that a solution to the problem will
soon be found.  Indeed, reconstruction plans, which will depend on
World Bank and other international finance, are already in an advanced
stage.

"Finance for local companies has been limited all over the Balkan
countries", says Peter Bod, the bank's board member for Hungary, the
Czech and Slovak Republics and Croatia.  "But as the region recovers
from the transitional depression and opportunities improve following
the implementation of the peace agreement, the demand for funds will
certainly explode.  The EBRD has been active in all member countries
and is willing to contribute to further modernisation in the Balkan
region".

Croatian example.  The EBRD is pointing to neighbouring Croatia as a
role model for its investment plans.  The country is a relatively new
member of the bank, but has been able to produce a selection of
bankable private and public sector projects.  In the last 12 months it
has become one of the most dynamically expanding clients of the EBRD.
This was against a backdrop of hyper-inflation of 1,150 per cent in
1993 (now down to 3 per cent) and surrounding instability.

The bank's Croatia portfolio tops $300m worth of infrastructure
reconstruction projects including $100m on new highways, $100m for
electricity network reconstruction and $80m for air traffic control.
There are also strong industrial projects, like the pharmaceutical
project at Pliva, and sizeable banking projects.  The bank is the sole
investor in Croatia's financial sector.

"Among the institutional prerequisites, the banking sector
rehabilitation is perhaps the crucial one" says Mr Bod.  "Bilateral
support and multilateral assistance should concentrate on this task.
Reliable banking and savings institutions are needed to support savings
in the countries concerned.  Domestic sources must become the main
source of investment and trade finance".  He points to the region's
more advanced transition countries where two thirds of financing
requirements are sourced domestically.

Gap for EBRD.  None of the countries in the region has an "investment
grade" classification from the World Bank.  Western investment banks
are therefore reluctant to take long-term risk in the region.  The
local banks' capability and willingness to take longer term corporate
risk is also limited, partly because of a lack of longer term deposits.
 Moreover the structures of the banking industry in the region are
highly concentrated.  This is where the EBRD will come in.

The EBRD sees a mammoth task ahead.  In previously war-stricken areas
it has identified wholesale investment requirements in physical
infrastructure - bridges, power, roads, water supplies, health care,
housing.  The Trans-European routes have been neglected and suffered
destruction and require major reconstruction.  Formation of new states
needs new cross-border transport and communication links.  And the
region is saddled with companies whose equipment is obsolete and calls
for extensive upgrading and modernisation.

EBRD PREPARES FOR SOFIA

As the New Year dawned, officials from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) declared themselves well
satisfied with progress to date for the 1996 conference to be held in
Sofia in April.

Bulgarian businessmen may be profoundly sceptical that the capital can
cope with the thousands who turn up for the bank's annual jamboree. But
the "sherpas", who have been carrying out the donkey work since last
September, believe they have cracked the main problems.

Sofia's airport is a notorious bottle neck at normal times. Immigration
and customs would be completely overwhelmed by jumbo-loads of high-
powered international politicians and bankers. Soviet administrations,
however, were finely tuned to the needs of visiting dignitaries. Their
legacy is a 1960s-built VIP wing as large as the main terminal itself.
This will be placed at the disposal of the EBRD caravanserai.

Electricity?  Sofia also boasts a late 1970s Congress Centre designed
with command economy mass rallies in mind. Officials have found its
layout and design more functional and easier to move around in than
anything Budapest, St Petersburg or London have been able to supply.
More importantly in this city of unreliable utilities, the centre has
independent power supplies.

Tight squeeze.  Hotel accommodation remains a bone of contention.
Gilbert Sabathe, (the bank's assistant secretary-general) in charge of
conference planning and protocol, is confident of putting up the core
delegations in western comfort at the Sheraton, InterContinental and
Novotel. A further 19 hotels have been chosen to accommodate the
expected 2,000 to 2,500 visiting foreign representatives, guests and
press. (Bulgarian attendees are expected to find private
accommodation.)

Even with these numbers - distinctly on the low side by Budapest and St
Petersburg standards - the bank's travel agents have had to scour the
countryside and 2-star operations in the less salubrious inner city
quarters to come up with sufficient beds. No recommendations on room
sharing have yet been issued.

Mr Sabathe concedes that Sofia, like some other East European capitals,
may not be ideally suited to servicing pampered westerners but he
regards it as central to EBRD's role to encourage such cities to reach
international standards.

HORN SHOWS IRRITATION

"There is only one decision-making authority in this country and this
is the government," Gyula Horn, the Hungarian prime minister, said last
month. He is increasingly irritated by the rejection of some of his
economic policies either by parliament, by the Constitutional Court or
his own Socialist Party.

In an interview with a local economic newspaper Mr Horn said he was
surprised by the parliament's vote (including some support from the
ruling coalition) demanding that the extra revenue generated by
privatisation sales is devoted to reducing Hungary's debt rather than
spent on domestic investments. However, Mr Horn is confident that he
can modify the decision when the full extent of the revenue is known.

The rejection of some of the cutbacks in social provisions by the
Constitutional Court forced the government to raise the top rate of
personal income tax from 44 per cent to 48 per cent but the "main
problem is that this leads to the further weakening of the middle
layers", said the prime minister. "Many take the view that the
government is pursuing a kamikaze policy, working against its own
future. But what else can we do in the current economic situation? ...
Here we cannot proceed according to party-political criteria".

At the same time he conceded that it is "unjust that the wage position
of public sector workers is getting worse from year to year ... Next
year we hope to stop this trend, although there is no scope for
improvement".

About the next two years Mr Horn said that 1996 "will be the year of
creating employment and stabilisation. In 1997 the credits (from
Germany and the Far East) will bear fruit."

ROMANIAN LINKS WITH ITALY

The crash of a Romanian airliner after take-off from Verona on December
13 has revealed the build-up of a close business relationship between
the Verona-Vicenza-Treviso area of Italy's Veneto region and the
Timisoara-Arad-Oradea area on Romania's west.

Of the 49 killed in the Banat Air Antonov 24 turbo-prop, 30 were
Italians and included entrepreneurs, technicians and accountants. Most
were bound for Timisoara on what is now  a thrice weekly service,
extending also to Bucharest.

Passenger lists of the Italians showed their activities were in textile
and apparel manufacture, sale of textile machinery and printing
machinery, agricultural seeds, bakery, bijouterie and silversmiths.

A regular traveller, not on the aircraft, said it was advantageous for
a medium-small entrepreneur to set up a manufacturing operation in
Romanian as manpower costs were lower than in Slovenia or Hungary.

According to the economic newspaper 24 Ore some 150 companies dealing
with west Romania have been established in Verona alone, while the
Verona-Timisoara service has in the last year carried nearly 10,000
passengers.

DEVISING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES

Experts from eight CIS governments and parliaments sat down with
western experts in Istanbul at the end of last year and worked out a so-
called framework destined, as the Paris-based OECD told EEM, "to
enshrine good principles of open and even-handed treatment of foreign
direct investment".

Rolf Alter, senior negotiator of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development said that the "Framework for  Foreign
Investment in Transition Economies" does not have official status as
yet, but "reflects the cumulative experience of experts from both CIS
and OECD member countries".

He added: "Those on the CIS side were not officially representing their
governments.  Rather, they were people with expertise in applying
foreign investment legislation and who had been confronted with the
problems in this field.  The framework is a kind of `how-to-do-it'
document".

OECD, which serves as a think-tank for the world's industrialised
countries, said it will hopefully provide a source on which CIS
countries can draw in revising foreign investment laws; a basis for co-
ordinating advice to CIS countries; help harmonise CIS legislation with
international standards, such as investment protection treaties, and,
above all, "foster clarity and transparency in CIS countries' foreign
investment legislation".

The meeting was attended by representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Ukraine was a notable absentee.

HUNGARIAN BANK TO LEAVE LONDON

Due to anticipated changes in Hungarian legislation as well as to meet
international requirements, Hungary's most successful foreign banking
operations - the London-based Hungarian International Bank (HIB) - is
to be wound up.

The decision follows unsuccessful soundings by the 93 per cent owners
of the bank, the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to sell it as a going
concern to foreign interests.  OTP, the Hungarian savings bank owns the
remaining 7 per cent.

During its last financial year ending in September 1994 HIB made a
profit before tax of $4.3m.  While some of Hungary's larger banks would
have liked to acquire the operation - which has been active in London
since 1973 as a trade finance and forfaiting institution - banking
sources indicated that the capital strength of the would-be owners did
not impress the Bank of England sufficiently to endorse the change of
ownership.

The bank's operations are currently under winding down, with a view to
closure by end-1996.  However, it is understood that some activity
mainly forfaiting may be carried on as a new operation by OTP, although
no  statement was forthcoming either from HIB or OTP on future
intentions.

The NBH in Hungary was unwilling to make a statement about their
reasons for their failure to sell HIB as a going concern.  Some
observers were surprised that HIB was not sold to third parties as it
would have represented considerable capital value.  However, contrary
opinion was expressed by Jack Wilson, who was managing director of HIB
during the 1980s and now is chairman of London  Forfaiting Company, a
leading player in the forfaiting market.  "A banking licence in London
has a doubtful value.  The Bank of England does not encourage the trade
in existing banking licences", he said.

The closure will mean the end of 60 jobs although some of its
activities may be continued under a different name and different
ownership.  HIB has representative offices in Frankfurt, Zurich, Tokyo,
Paris, New York, Budapest as well as in Cambridge and Manchester in the
UK.

Two other NBH-owned banks are also to be sold.  The Frankfurt-based
Deutsche-Ungarische Bank and the Vienna-based Central Wechsel und
Creditbank have been  put on the market.

POLAND'S BANKS ON THE MOVE

After lagging in the Polish economy's economic growth stakes, the
banking sector is moving ahead with privatisation and looks set to
become a spectacular success story into the coming decade.  This is the
prediction of Derek Chambers, banking specialist at James Capel Europe,
who has singled out the country's nascent High Street banks as the
sector's beneficiaries of the "most exciting growth".

Speaking at a recent seminar in London on Poland's privatisation
programme, Mr Chambers pointed out that the country's banking sector is
already beginning to see a rapid increase in the scale of its
activities.  He pointed out that consumer borrowing is growing at a
rate similar to what was experienced in the UK in the 1970s.
"Inflation is 23 per cent this year" noted Mr Chambers.  "It will be 20
per cent next year and fall to 14 per cent in 1997.  Our belief is that
the retail banks will benefit from this situation.  Three or four of
the privatised banks will have excellent prospects".

His reasons for optimism are many.  Paradoxically, one is the  state of
health of the much-maligned zloty.  There has been a decline in foreign
currency deposits in Poland following the zloty's stabilisation against
the dollar, making zloty returns more attractive.  More employees are
being paid by bank transfer, and the number of active personal accounts
has soared over the past 12-18 months, doubling or even trebling in
some banks.  Consumer finance for purchase of household durables is now
within reach with the fall of inflation and interest rates and it is
estimated that as much as two thirds of consumer durables are now
purchased on credit.

Rapid growth of accounts.  Traditionally, the number of adult Poles
with bank accounts was low - not much more than 20 per cent.  Mr
Chambers predicts that the changes in Poland's economic climate are
helping to revolutionise this situation.  "The development of the
economy and the relatively small scale of banking intermediation at the
moment, means that an annual double digit percentage real growth in
banking business volumes will be sustained for some years to come," he
said.  "Lower margins will be required to make banking services
affordable, but the volume growth should offset the margin effect on
profitability".

Lower real interest rates also make lending to private sector
enterprise more viable.  Business is showing increasing willingness to
embark on large scale investment projects.  In the first half of 1995,
private sector investment outlays increased by nearly 50 per cent in
real terms.  Overall, he believes that banking services could easily
double relative to the economy over the next 10 years, which would add
7 per cent per annum real growth to underlying 5 per cent growth.

Although international banks are much in evidence in Poland, most of
the future growth is likely to come from domestically-based banking
institutions.  "Some of the banks that have emerged from the state
banking sector are likely to be the best placed to provide the services
that the population and the economy will require", adds Mr Chambers.

In the 1980s commercial banking in Poland was monopolised by the
central bank. However, there were also other specialised institutions.
Bank Handlowy was originally founded in the nineteenth century and
regained its autonomy in the 1960s, specialising in foreign trade.
Although it has lost its monopoly, it continues to handle about half of
foreign trade finance.  PKO BP, the national savings bank, has the
largest branch network, and also finances home loans.

Bank Pekao is the main foreign currency deposit-taker in Poland, and
the largest bank in terms of deposits.  In 1989, the central bank hived
off its branches into nine regional banks, which developed into quasi
regular commercial banks.  Three have been privatised, and
privatisation of a further two or three is likely during the next year.
 The rest will be taken out of state control before the end of 1996.

Mr Chambers does, however, see one down side: "The banks have not been
totally privatised.  There are still substantial holdings in the hands
of state agencies.  I would like to see a change in this."

ELECTION RESULTS: THE MEANING

Why should a president with a popular rating in single-digits believe
he can win re-election six months after the party of his supporters
takes a  drubbing?

The victories of "Our House is Russia" in Moscow (19 per cent) and the
Communist Party in the country (22 per cent) once again provide Mr
Yeltsin with the confrontationist card he has always enjoyed playing;
the one he exploited in the early months of 1993 when he promoted
polarisation  with a "communist" parliament, and acted as if Russians
have only one reform  democrat choice to make.

Now, as western governments and media rumble with warnings of a
communist return to power, Mr Yeltsin  can try to upstage opposition
democrat Grigory  Yavlinsky, whose failure to improve on the 8 per cent
vote his Yabloko party won in 1993 is a serious blow to his
presidential chances.

After co-founder of Yabloko, Yury Boldyrev, recently resigned with a
withering attack onMr Yavlinsky's  political morals (see below), and
another founder,  Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, left amidst criticism of Mr
Yavlinsky,  competence,  Yabloko is floundering. As a one-man vehicle
for Mr Yavlinsky's ambitions,  the party has nowhere to turn now,
except towards those who backed the  government on December 17, or
towards the Moscow democrats who split between Mr  Yavlinsky, Yegor
Gaidar and Sviatoslav Fyodorov.

If, as seems likely, Mr Yeltsin retains the  Prime Minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and  strengthens the reform faction of ministers in his
government, he can  outflank Mr Yavlinsky in the electorate. By a
combination of bullying and  bribery, he should also be able to lure
the banks and oil companies away  from financing the huge costs Mr
Yavlinsky will need to sink into television in  order to stay in the
race.

The replacement of the foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev - which even he
admits  to expecting now - is an easy sop to the new parliament. It may
be a  consolation prize for Ivan Rybkin, the former speaker of the
Duma, whose  Kremlin-sponsored bloc failed to win any seats.

Last month's result confirms what has been obvious on both sides of the
Kremlin wall for months. Mr Chernomyrdin is unelectable for president,
and cannot expect to take Yeltsin's mantle in what some Kremlin
advisers once imagined would be a "natural succession" to the
presidency. The election result also destroyed the reputation of
government apparat and the oil and gas lobby - once presumed to be the
most powerful vote-getting machines in the country.

The two machines that emerge from the parliamentary election are the
Communist Party, and the city of Moscow. United, the two would almost
certainly defeat Yeltsin. Divided, Mr Yeltsin can defeat the
communists. Thus, Gennady Zyuganov and Mr Yeltsin are bound to admit
their chances of  winning power depend on which way the mayor, Yury
Luzhkov, decides to swing.

With 22 per cent of the vote, plus 4 per cent for Viktor Anpilov's
alternative communist bloc, and the eclipse of rural ally, the Agrarian
Party, the  communist leadership  can read the election outcome as good
for the  party, but not for  Mr Zyuganov as a presidential candidate.
Senior party figures knew that beforehand. They told EEM they would
analyse  the Duma poll to judge whom to choose as the figurehead of an
alliance against Yeltsin.

Lebed marginalised.  The surprise failure of the Congress of Russian
Communities (KRO) to reach  the 5 per cent required for party seats in
parliament, can be explained by the lack of effective grassroots
organisation, and the drift of votes from the industrial centres to the
Communist Party, not to Yury Skokov. His rivalry with General Alexander
Lebed has cost KRO dear. Gen Lebed himself won a personal seat for the
arms-manufacturing centre of Tula.  But without a KRO faction to sit
with, he is now a commander without troops. To advance further, he now
needs the Communist Party. The election result doesn't suggest they
need him, because the general is not a vote-winner in the big cities.

The Duma election demonstrated again, if anyone needs to be told, how
isolated Moscow has become from the rest of the country - an island of
affluence in a sea of poverty and resentment.  Mr Yeltsin's re-election
strategy  must capitalise on support from Moscow, and on the resistance
to a return of  the communists to power that is still felt throughout
the country. The man  Mr Yeltsin needs is the same man the communists
will be looking to for their  figurehead - this is Mr Luzhkov.

M r Yeltsin's confidante, Alexander Korzhakov, made it clear in a
television interview just before the December poll that he expects Mr
Luzhkov to stay out of presidential politics - at least until the end
of Yeltsin's second term. "If he decides to  run for re-election as
mayor",  Mr Korzhakov said of Mr Luzhkov, "I will vote for him. But if
he decides to run for president in 2000, I will not vote for him."

Mr Luzhkov has three months to judge whether he is better off siding
with Mr Yeltsin or against him. If Mr Yeltsin stokes the same fire with
parliament as  in 1993, it is likely Mr Luzhkov will also follow the
same course, keeping his head down.

Another sign to lift Yeltsin's presidential election chances was the
size of the no vote. Since Mr Yeltsin's first presidential election win
in 1991, Russian voters have steadily reflected their disappointment by
staying home on election day. This time, however, turnout rose to 64
per cent across the  country, confounding many politicians who expected
a further drop below the  51 per cent who voted in 1993.

The gain in voters' sense of duty was partly an achievement of the
disciplined local Communist Party organisations. But an estimated 5 per
cent of Russian voters chose the bottom-line on their ballot paper in
which they rejected all of the 43 parties listed.

When parliament debated the law on presidential elections early last
year, the Kremlin successfully pressed to remove this choice out of
fear the  no-vote may end up larger than the vote for the winning
presidential  candidate. That was done. When the presidential poll,
planned in June, takes place, Mr Yeltsin can count on forcing a simple
choice on the voters - the communists or himself. Those who don't like
that will stay at home, and the result is one Mr Yeltsin has reason to
be confident he can win.

SIGNIFICANCE OF MOSCOW RESULTS

The parliamentary election results have once again made clear that the
policies of President Yeltsin and the popular reaction that  galvanised
the Communist Party vote open a huge political divide separating
Moscow from the rest of the country.  Ironically, it is this which
sustains the government's confidence that it can continue in power, and
poses the most serious obstacle to the  communist challenge. To bridge
the divide in the presidential election  starting up now will require a
candidate who promises to keep Moscow's  affluence intact, while
convincing provincial Russians that, however unfair  and miserable
their lot may be, the communist alternative would be much worse.

The most notable result of the Duma election campaign is that the
communist gain is a consolidation, not a significant increase in their
national vote. The government's loss of votes is a defeat in the
country, but not in the capital. Put the two together, and you have a
case of all that changes stays the same. The sensation of deja vu is
bound to follow if  politicking in the early months of 1996 begin to
resemble the same period of  1993.

Support for government.  The election returns indicate Moscow was the
only major part of  the country where support for the government
remained stable, and  where the pro-government bloc came in ahead of
the opposition. Though the  parties and movements have changed names
and leaders, roughly 33 per cent of  Muscovites supported the
government in 1993; those votes were cast for  Russia's Choice (Yegor
Gaidar), the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  (Sergei Shakhrai), and
a number of small democratic reform groups. In December, the percentage
was almost identical, though this time the votes went  to Prime
Minister Chernomyrdin's "Our House is Russia" (NDR), Mr Gaidar's
Democratic Choice of Russia, and another handful of democrats.

In Moscow, the centre opposition or anti-government democrats have also
remained more or less in the same position, with just under 20 per cent
of the votes. In 1993 they included Yabloko (12 per cent) and the
Democratic Party of Russia (6 per cent); this year Yabloko did better
(15 per cent) and in place of the Democratic Party, Sviatoslav
Fyodorov's Working People's Self-government party emerged (4.5 per
cent).

Finally, the left opposition among Muscovites has changed character,
but its share of the total vote has stayed much the same as in 1993.
Then the Communist Party recorded 11 per cent; Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) 13 per cent. This time, the
Communist Party grew to 15 per cent, the LDPR slipped below 5 per cent,
and the Congress of Russian Communities (KRO) replaced it with 6 per
cent.  The national figures show some differences, but the underlying
picture hasn't changed. Communist support is much greater than in
Moscow, but  proportionally not very much greater countrywide than the
1993 result.  Yabloko as the democratic alternative to the government
hasn't budged, and  remains at the same 8 per cent mark.

The government party NDR has been hit harder this time than Russia's
Choice  was in 1993. When Mr Gaidar drew 15 per cent, the defeat was a
stinging one. Now  that Mr Chernomyrdin has won just 10 per cent, the
result, though anticipated by  the Kremlin and press, ought not to be
less painful. With Mr Gaidar just clearing the 5 per cent barrier,
their combined total stays at 15 per cent. That  neither the Kremlin
nor the White House appears to be feeling too much pain  is explained
by their location in the heart of Moscow. In a real sense, they  won
Moscow - though they lost the country. Holding on to their political
power would be impossible without Moscow. What sort of power they can
exercise when the rest of the country has turned against them will be
seen  as the presidential campaign accelerates - and as the
independently elected  deputies of the Duma, and the regional
representatives in the Federation  Council take their new seats.

Because so many parties competed, but fell short of the 5 per cent
minimum vote required to be represented, their vote has been
redistributed to the five parties that have qualified  This will have
the  effect of magnifying the number of the Communist Party's seats
well beyond  its proportional share of the vote. One estimate by a
Kremlin official  indicates the communists will occupy roughly one-
third of the 450 Duma seats  - a big gain over the last parliament, but
still short of a majority.  The one in three Moscow voters who
supported Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gaidar have  obvious economic
interests which a stable government can deliver more  reliably than Mr
Yavlinsky's promises. So long as Yury Luzhkov, the mayor of  Moscow,
stays loyal to Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, Moscow isn't likely to
fall  to Mr Yavlinsky. The communists have proved they couldn't elect a
president unless they find a non-communist to lead them, and he would
also have to appeal to Moscow's pro-government interests.  That's a
political improbability Mr Yeltsin should savour, for he can appeal to
both the pro-government Muscovites, and the large reservoir of anti-
communist sentiment in the countryside. Mr Yeltsin can borrow Charles
De Gaulle's slogan, "apres moi, le deluge". Even if still ailing, he
may not need to  convince the voters there really is a "moi", so long
as the "deluge" is worrying enough.

FIGHT OVER NEW OIL LAW

Yabloko leader and presidential candidate, Grigory Yavlinsky, has come
under attack by the co-founder of his party, Yury Boldyrev, for trying
to promote oil company profits at the expense of Russia's national
interests.  The attack by Mr Boldyrev, who represents St Petersburg in
the outgoing  Federation Council, came on the eve of the December 19
session of the Council, when the senators voted to approve amendments
to the law on production-sharing in the oil and gas industry, and send
the revised bill to the President for signing.

Mr Boldyrev told EEM he resigned from Mr Yabloko several weeks ago
because of M r Yavlinsky's refusal to allow amendments to the
production-sharing law favoured by a majority of the Duma. Mr Boldyrev
is now deputy chairman of the Accounting Chamber, the independent
watchdog of government spending. Before his parliamentary career, Mr
Boldyrev headed anti-corruption investigations in the presidential
administration.

He led the Federation Council campaign to reject the Duma version of
the law, which was passed in June after intense lobbying by oil
companies and government officials. From July until October, the
Council came under the same pressure, but finally voted to reject the
key provisions.

That no-vote in the upper chamber included many regional
representatives appointed by the president, who were antagonized by the
lobbying campaign. The Council veto was the biggest defeat this year
for the oil and gas lobby, provoking Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to
publicly criticize the  fuel and  energy minister, Yury Shafranik, for
not lobbying hard enough.

"The first version [of the law] allowed the executive power to sign any
kind of contract", Mr Boldyrev said. "Any contract was allowable and
did not take into account the national interest." When the Accounting
Chamber asked the government in August to provide details and contracts
for the major oil  and gas projects at stake, nothing was handed over.

Opposing arguments.  These amendments were voted by the Duma on
December 6. Mr Yavlinsky's Yabloko was united in voting against, but
failed. Mr Yavlinsky has argued that the concessions are vital if
foreign energy companies will agree to invest billions of dollars in
Russian projects.  Mr Boldyrev says the amendments that have been
introduced in the law "allows and guarantees foreign investors, but
limits loopholes and stops making gifts of deposits to friends."

The amendments which were approved last month establish the primacy of
Russian civil and criminal law over contracts, and requires contract
disputes to be settled in Russian court. Tax and excise duty privileges
have  been trimmed, and new limits introduced on the concessions for
oil and gas  deposits which the government can award in contracts.
Production-sharing  benefits are to be allowed only for those deposits
and projects that are listed in federal law.

"These are the difficult deposits, which involve high costs and high-
risk investment",  Mr Boldyrev said. "They aren't the cream of the crop
which can be easily obtained."

He said the new law will tighten control of oil and gas concessions
that can be awarded without tender, and require investment contracts
for strategically important deposits to be approved by parliament.

In the Council, representatives of Russia's oil regions found
themselves in an ambiguous position over the terms of the production-
sharing law. Though it promised to open the doors to foreign investment
that is desperately needed in their regions, the small print of the law
took away the power to decide contracts from the regional authorities,
and gave it to the federal government. The regional senators are much
happier with the amended law than with the original version.

Explaining how the oil lobby was more successful in the opposition-led
Duma than in the more conservative Council, Mr Boldyrev said: "In the
upper chamber there are more experienced people, and more diverse
interests."

FLOWER POWER

When Muscovites celebrate national holidays, rose-growers on the
mountain slopes of Ecuador run out of roses to sell, and prices go up
rapidly. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, where most of Europe's cut
flowers are auctioned, if every Dutchman were to buy a rose between now
 and New Year, the number of roses traded would still be less than the
number  of roses Moscow will buy in the same period.

 It is figures like this that make Moscow the largest, fastest growing
market for cut flowers in Europe. And because fast growth also promises
fast money, dozens of speculators and short-term traders jostle the
larger Russian flower companies in what one executive calls "unhealthy
competition."

Today, flower entrepreneurs told EEM, there are about 60 importers of
cut  flowers for sale in Moscow. The total is an inexact one, because
many appear  for just one or two deals, often concentrating on sales
for a single  holiday, the March 8 "Women's Day." It is on that day the
Russian flower  business reaches its annual peak. Retail sellers'
margins, which usually  average around 100 per cent, leap to 200 per
cent and higher.

Valery Stayen, chief executive of Business Bouquet, believes that about
20 companies are regular importers of flowers. His company is one of
the largest, bringing in from the Dutch auctions by truck 300,000 roses
each week. Another "five or six" companies, Mr Stayen calculates, may
be importing comparable volumes of flowers. Together with the smaller
operators, the total imports to Moscow may exceed 2m weekly, or 8m per
month.

No-one in the flower trade knows for sure, and Customs figures are
misleading because most importers avoid paying the full 25 per cent
duty by official, as well as unofficial means.

According to Mr Stayen, the Moscow flower market is quite unlike other
cities in Europe or the US. Because of the long cold season, and the
sale of flowers on the street, only thick-stemmed roses and carnations
are suitable for trade. Ecuador produces most of the roses Russians
buy, but of the 30 types grown, only 10 can be sold to the Russian
trade. Inadequate and slow air transport between Quito, Ecuador's
capital, and Moscow, gives the Dutch brokers the chance to dominate
Russian supply - at least until the Russian flower companies can start
up their own plantations in Ecuador, and improve cargo delivery times.

Carnations, the second Russian choice, mostly originate now from
Columbia, Spain, Kenya and Israel. Again, the Dutch market serves as
the intermediary, adding about 16 per cent in margin, plus extra
transport costs. At least one Israeli horticultural company has a joint-
venture investment in a Kaluga-region growing operation; but foreign
investment of this kind is  rare.

Fluctuating market.  Russian tastes are also unique. "In Europe flower
demand is stable," Mr Stayen observed. "People use flowers in their
house each day. In Russia, there is  still the habit of buying for
special occasions. And because of that, because you have to have the
flower for that day, it doesn't matter how much it  costs."

Imports face limited domestic competition. There are a handful of
horticultural farms in the Moscow region. But they and Moscow's cottage
gardeners were able to exploit this year's unusually dry, hot weather
to produce more than the usual supply of roses, together with other
varieties of flowers. Although the Dutch auction price doesn't
fluctuate much seasonally, domestic Russian flowers were able to pull
down the import price this year.

Changed supplies.  Just over three years ago, at the start of 1992, the
market conditions were entirely different. Mostsvettorg, a state
enterprise, held the monopoly of imports, distribution, and retail
sales through its own kiosks and shops. Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan
supplied most of the roses and carnations within the Soviet economy;
Bulgaria, Egypt and Vietnam provided imports as part of inter-state
barter trade.

The collapse of the Soviet trading system, and war in Azerbaijan, have
virtually eliminated these sources of supply. Although Azeri traders
still control some retail locations around Moscow, they no longer
dominate the import business. The largest importers are now Russian.

Mr Stayen's company started three years as a small floral decorator,
providing exotic flower arrangements for companies, offices, and
special occasions to order. It then moved into the import business, and
began operating as a major wholesaler, not only to Moscow but  to a
network of provincial cities. They now number more than two dozen.

"For us", Mr Stayen told EEM, "it is not necessary to be the biggest
importer.  Better to optimise profitability on operations." Business
Bouquet dismisses  the buy-cheap, sell-dear tactics of the small
operators. It concentrates on  establishing regular volume clients, and
cutting supply costs.

CASPIAN SEA SAGA TO CONTINUE

The Caspian pipeline saga looks set to continue throughout 1996.  Last
October, the consortium developing Azerbaijan's principal offshore
reserves announced their intention to export "early oil" via both
Russia and Georgia - with a Russian contract to be signed by the end of
the month.  That contract has still not been signed and, with Chechnya
again embroiled in an increasingly violent conflict, the question is
whether Moscow can actually deliver on its promises concerning
Azerbaijani oil exports via Grozny and the Russian Black sea oil
terminal of Novorossiysk.

Georgian problems.  Ironically, no progress seems to have been made on
the second project, the establishment/renovation of a pipeline from
Baku to the Georgian port of Soupsa, for eventual export by ship to
northern Turkey.  For while the Russians have got bogged down over a
variety of security, financial and capacity considerations, the
Georgian line ran into problems over project finance structuring.

A fresh series of meetings scheduled for January could resolve the key
financial problems affecting both routes, but the security problems are
more difficult to resolve.  Negotiations on the northern route
initially became stalled because the Russians began demanding port fees
for the use of Novorossiysk in addition to the charge of $2.80 in
transit fees which would be levied for every barrel of Azerbaijani
crude shipped through the system.  The $2.80 figure is a net rate,
taking into account the half dollar depreciation which would stem from
the necessary blending of relatively high quality Azerbaijani crude
with Russia's own Urals blend.

Although this is around 50 cents higher than the $2.30 calculation for
comparable cost of shipping early oil out via Soupsa, the consortium
does not appear to believe that cheaper oil shipment costs warrant an
preference being given to the Georgian route.  For one thing, the costs
of this differential will be borne by Azerbaijan, in its capacity as
owner of the actual reserves being exported.  The 1994 agreement under
which Azerbaijan granted the three fields of Chirag, Guneshli and Azeri
to the consortium specified that capital and operational expenditures
were to be deducted before royalties were due, so transit costs, which
are generally covered by these headings, matter less to the consortium
than they do to the Azerbaijani government, which would in effect bear
the cost of the extra 50 cents through decreased revenues.

Russia's dilemma.  From the Russian perspective, the question is
whether capturing up to 5m tonnes (100,000 b/d) of Azerbaijani early
oil for Novorossiysk is worth the fact that it will displace an
equivalent volume of purely Russian exports, since Novorossiysk is
already working at its full capacity of just 32m tonnes per year and,
with troubles dogging the rival Caspian Pipeline Consortium's proposal
for a capacity expansion line from Tikhoretsk to a single point mooring
just west of Novorossiysk, it looks as if it will be some years before
handling capacity is increased. Such problems are capable of commercial
resolution and the long-term prospect of securing full-scale
Azerbaijani exports for Novorossiysk can serve as a rationale for short-
term cutbacks, or re-routing , of Russia's own exports, particularly
where the volumes are so relatively small.  But the recent fighting in
Chechnya raises problems of an altogether different dimension, and here
the consortium remains dangerously vulnerable.

Grozny route vital.  In the long run, it can certainly consider a
pipeline routing to Novorossiysk that avoids Chechnya, but in the short
run, it has to use the Grozny line if it is to export early oil.  This
requires an essentially political decision and the impression at
present is that two of the consortium's main pillars, Amoco of the US
and British Petroleum , are still trying to secure use of the Grozny
route because they believe close co-operation with Moscow is essential
for their other oil interests in the region whilst also being necessary
in terms of assuaging Moscow's concerns about the very fact that they
are developing the still controversial and politically disputed oil
reserves off the coast of Azerbaijan.

Turkish election result.  As for the Georgian route, Turkey continues
to stress that is would provide full political risk guarantees for any
oil shipped by that route in the hope that this will encourage the
consortium to shift its focus away from Novorossiysk.

Now that it looks likely that the Islamist Refah party will not come to
power in Ankara, prospects for the Georgian route have improved.  But,
as always, nothing is certain in this enduring saga.

EMPLOYEE RIGHTS DEMANDED

With some exceptions "the rights of ordinary employees to take part in
privatisation are either non-existent or widely ignored in many former
socialist countries in this part of the world," according to Robert
Oakeshott, executive director of London's Job Ownership Ltd (JOL).  He
was addressing an international seminar in Slovakia on employee
involvement in privatisation.

He cited as exceptions Slovenia and Bulgaria, among five countries with
which he worked; the others being Hungary, Romania and Macedonia.  Even
in Romania and Hungary however, despite "quite robust" laws on
employees rights, "it seems that managers and others with unusual
influence are frequently able to trample over them."

It was therefore significant that leading trade unions in at least
three countries - Bulgaria, Slovenia, Macedonia - had "now woken up to
the fact that members' rights in privatisation may need to be fought
for and then protected."

Is privatisation in Eastern Europe therefore a rip-off, from the
ordinary working person's viewpoint?  Such a feeling was not far from
the surface at the two-day seminar, where discussions focused on
various forms of possible employee involvement, such as direct share
ownership, MEBOs (Management-led Employee Buy-Outs) and ESOPs (Employee
Share Ownership Plans), in which a trust is established to hold
employees' shares.  The meeting was hosted by the Slovak metalworkers
union Kovo, with some organisational and financial support respectively
from JOL and Britain's Know-How Fund (KHF).

Criticism of Slovakia.  The keynote speaker was Eugen Skultety's, Kovo
vice-president, who did not mince words about his government's
privatisation methods.  Privatisation had taken an "unethical and often
illegal  course."  Citizens were losing confidence in the process, but
were too frightened to complain.  The absence of controlling organs
"creates an optimal milieu for a variety of speculators, illegal money
exchangers and a number of, we can openly say, mafias acting in this
field."

After describing some of the techniques these people employed, Mr
Skultety recalled that in May the Slovak government had adopted five
principles for the participation of employees, but these principles
were ignored by the National Property Fund, whose activity in
implementing privatisation was "completely non-transparent."

Mr Skultety's criticisms were backed by a legal adviser, Prof Gustav
Lesyk, who spoke of the privatisation of a chemical company employing
3,400.  Seventten managers got 34 per cent of the shares, and employees
the rest; the managers' shares were in bearer form so they could be
available to political friends.  But Prof Lesyk added, the unions must
keep out of politics.  "The unions role is to depoliticise the whole
thing."

Slovak participants heard presentations on employee ownership in
western companies like Republic Engineered Steels of US, Tullis Russel
(paper making) and Baxi Partnership) (domestic heating) of Britain.
They were also told about experiences nearer home, in Eastern Europe,
where JOL and KHF have been working.

Except for Macedonia, still at the starting line, the state of play
could be summed up as follows:

* A successful example is that of Herend, the 126 year old Hungarian
porcelain maker.  It described how an ESOP agreement establishing
employee ownership was signed in 1992.  Hungary is reported to have
about 100 ESOP companies but not all do so well.

* Eugenie Kostourkov, director of the Ownership Foundation, Sofia,
spoke of lobbying to get employee ownership legislation passed in
Bulgaria, resulting in the birth so far of some 20 ESOPs. He
illustrated two successful pilot projects; one, a company making
tractor parts which are exported to Germany; the other, a battery
manufacturer which had lost business with Russia's car plant at
Togliatti, but since diversified into other types of batteries.

* Slovenia, after some questionable early grabs by managers while an
old Yugoslav law was still in force, has probably the widest worker
ownership.  In 83 per cent of companies so far privatised, employees
hold the maximum permitted stake of 60 per cent.  Aleksandra Kanjuo-
Mrcela of DEZAP  however pointed out that this represents only some 50
per cent of capital value.  DEZAP, established to promote serious and
lasting employee ownership, has seven company members plus the Slovene
Free Trade Union Federation, though some others are poised to join,
including the leading domestic appliance maker Gorenje.

* Romania had no one present at the meeting, but JOL has organised
seminars there and invited several representatives on study tours to
Britain.  A considerable number of MEBOs are reported to have taken
place, though how many will stand the test of time has yet to be seen.
(continued on page 14)

In Slovakia, the question now is whether these experiences of others
can prove useful in launching similar employee involvement schemes in
the privatisation process, which is due to be completed by next June.
Or will they be frustrated by a regime which - if critics are to be
believed - increasingly shows authoritarian tendencies reminiscent of a
past era?

CASE STUDY - BOC IN POLAND

Britain's BOC Group has more than 20  years' track record in Poland.
Operating BOC Gazy - 70 per cent of its shares owned by the BOC group
and 30 per cent by the Polish State Treasury - it has since the early
1970s been Poland's sole supplier of helium.  It is now  also the
country's largest merchant hydrogen supplier, offering its customers a
high purity gases capacity, with a combination of both locally-sourced
and imported product.

The company was formed in April 1993 with the joint venture and was
bolstered by BOC Gazy's acquisition of three Polgaz (the former state
gases company) plants in the towns of Siewierz, Poznan and Wroclaw.
BOC Gazy has a 650-strong local workforce based on eight locations.  It
boasts between 25-30 per cent market share.  And it is extremely upbeat
about its experience.

"We were among the pioneers in joint venture investment in Poland"
boasts John Filer, the BOC director responsible for the Polish venture.
 "And our operations have continued to expand with increasing success.
From the start we took the view that Poland presented by far the best
investment opportunity.  And so far we have been proved right".

BOC's investment to date is 30m ($45m) and this will rise to between
#35m and #40m in the next few years.  The company paid 6m for the
initial deal for the three plants, and has pumped #2m a year into its
distribution network.  Currently it is expanding with a 65 tonnes-a-day
oxygen production plant for Elstal Labedy in Gliwice to be opened in
January 1996 and a 450 tonnes-a-day cyrogenic air separation unit (ASU)
at the Huta Czestochowa steelworks to come on-stream in mid-1996.

Distribution.  The company found that Polish industrial gases companies
operated on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with customers compelled to
collect their goods.  "Distribution was the missing link and to this
day there remains a "production mentality.  I make it - the customer
collects it".  As Mr Filer puts it: "Distribution was another word for
middleman - someone who got a cut without actually making anything.
What's more, they found that Polish companies had no confidence in
state producers, giving rise to a "DIY mentality."

BOC Gazy set out to change that.  It invested a fleet of modern liquid
tankers and palletised cylinder vehicles and is in the process of
establishing a network of strategically-located retail outlets - both
company-owned and independent agencies.  As a result, it has given the
country its first-ever reliable supplies of high purity liquid
nitrogen.  This will form the basis for growth of a wide range of
customer applications including purging, food freezing and electronics.

Its distribution asset programme includes the innovation - for Poland -
of BOC-owned storage tanks for liquefied gases in customers' premises.
BOC Gazy's will be the first two dedicated supply schemes in Poland,
supplying industrial gases by pipeline to large customers.

BOC Gazy's product range of liquid gases includes oxygen, nitrogen,
argon, carbon dioxide, helium and hydrogen, as well as compressed gases
for cutting and welding, oxy-fuel welding mixtures, and high purity
gases.

The company is bidding for business with major international companies,
themselves onward investors - Philips,  Pilkington's, Coca Cola,
PepsiCo (the latter currently have to import carbon dioxide), and the
freezing activity for McDonald's hamburgers.  "Before we came along
frozen meat for the food chains came from Germany" says Mr Filer.  "Now
locally produced meat is processed and frozen, and appears in the
hamburgers of consumers in Poland".  The company also supplies oxygen
to Polish hospitals.

Indigenous management.  Mr Filer puts much of the company's success
down to its indigenous management policy.  "This was deliberate from
the start.  We did not send any UK-based staff to Poland to take over.
The chairman is a Polish, so is his deputy.  We have recruited and
trained a professional sales team from within the ranks of the existing
employees.

Headaches with the workforce?  "Poland is strong in trade unions and
workers councils.  All I can say is that their co-operation has been
admirable.  And it should be taken into consideration that we pay our
workers a proportion of the profits so that they know that they have a
stake in ensuring that the company is a success".

Advice for others.  Mr Filer has some advice for western investors.  He
says they must accept that a sudden massive injection of foreign
capital - and presence - is bound to be traumatic experience for all
concerned on the ground and should be borne in mind.  "We believe that
western companies setting up shop there must also be prepared to invest
in the country and in its local communities".

FRENCH HYPERMARKET FOR POLAND

Centres Leclerc, a leading French hypermarket chain, has opened its
first Polish store at Ursynow, southern Warsaw, and plans a second
store at Zoliborz, west of the capital, in February.

Ninety per cent of goods on offer will be Polish food and clothes
because of high import duties, but the stores will be run on co-
operative lines established by the Centre's founder, Edouard Leclerc.
The Leclerc system is to group independent retailers under one roof and
one brand, giving them leverage with producers.

The Polish stores will be sponsored by French Leclerc stores, which
have invested FFr20m ($4m) in the programme.  Polish staff, accompanied
by their families, have been trained in France over three years.  In
all, the Polish expansion of Leclerc has been five years in the
preparation.

The stores in the Warsaw suburbs represent the first Polish investment
by a leading French chain.  French hypermarkets have been expanding
around the world, but have tended to avoid Eastern Europe.

Jean-Philippe Magre, the Leclerc executive in charge of the operation,
told EEM, "It's going to be a difficult market as Polish shoppers are
not yet at the stage of mass consumption.  Suggestions that Poland
represents a market of the kind that French chains found in Spain 20
years ago are erroneous.  We will draw first on a local population of
100,000 living five to 10 minutes from the store.

"We are starting modestly in Ursynow with only 2,000 square metres of
sales area, but plan to double this.  There will be petrol pumps, a
McDonald's and parking for 600 cars.  The Polish managers have all been
trained by us."

Leclerc wants  young Polish managers to imitate its French system of
powerful regional purchasing groups and to open quickly 10 stores-cum-
training centres, the basis of a future national chain.  Leclerc added
to EEM that the French government regrettably had offered no aid,
leaving it alone to fight "the German and Dutch groups investing
massively in Poland".

BULGARIAN GAS PROSPECTS

A new natural gas and light oil (condensate) field has been discovered
in northern Bulgaria by a local oil and gas exploration company.
According to the Oil and Gas Extraction Company  in Pleven, the field
is located outside the town of Montana near an old gas field.

Experts from the oil and natural gas department of the Committee for
Geology and Mineral Resources (CGMR) have estimated that the filed has
the potential of some 200,000 cu m of natural gas and around 40 cu m of
light oil per day.  Such a flow is considered to be very good as far as
current Bulgarian resources and demand are concerned.

Evaluation work on the commercial potential of the field is expected to
start early this year. The Pleven company will finance the evaluation
work.

Eight commercial natural gas fields have been discovered in Bulgaria so
far, all of them at a depth of 3,000m to 4,500m.  Experts believe that
the fields can also be found at a greater depth at the foot of the
Balkan mountain range.

According to experts, the share of locally produced natural gas may
rise to meet 15-20 per cent of Bulgaria's demand. Currently, Bulgarian
oil and gas reserves cover just about 1 per cent of the country's
needs.  Bulgaria currently lacks funds for proper exploration.

Six western companies have invested over $140m in oil and gas
exploration in Bulgaria, but only Texaco has discovered so far a
natural gas field that might be of commercial importance.  It is
located near the town of Varna on the Bulgarian Black Sea.  A final
assessment is being completed to determine the profitability of the
field considering extraction expenditures.

In the first half of this year, Bulgarian officials are expected to
meet with Texaco, Austria's OMV and Enterprise Oil to discuss whether
to establish a joint venture to develop it.

Investor protection row.  Bulgaria is planning to announce a new tender
with international participation, but critics say that the recently
adopted Concession Law creates obstacles rather than encourages foreign
investors.  One problem is that the law does not provide guarantees
that a company which has funded exploration work will also acquire a
concession for extraction - the company will have to participate in a
separate tender.

MOBILE TELEPHONE DISPUTE

France Telecom has asked the International Court of Justice to become
involved in a dispute with Poland over mobile telephone networks.  The
French company is seeking $500m in damages because it says Poland
failed to honour a pledge made in 1991 to allow it to run a GSM
cellular network.  France Telecom owns a 24.5 per cent stake in the
Polish telecom company PTK/Centertel.  This week Poland announced three
bids in a tender for licences.

GUATEMALA: NEW LAW LIMITING UNION RIGHTS FOR
CIVIL SERVANTS PROVOKES HUGE LABOR PROTESTS (Part 1)

     On May 23, Guatemala's governing Partido de Avanzada
Nacional (PAN) used its legislative majority to approve a new
law that eliminates the right to strike for most public
employees.  The law, which is part of a broad government
effort to modernize the state, has provoked bitter opposition
from public and private-sector unions.  Among other things,
labor leaders say the law is aimed at paving the way for
privatization of state enterprises by impeding the ability of
civil servants to resist the sale of government firms.
     When Guatemala's current Constitution took effect in
1986, the country's labor movement strongly supported some of
the clauses contained in the new Magna Carta, especially its
recognition of the right of civil servants to organize unions
and to strike, which was an important break from past
constitutions that prohibited such rights among public
employees.  Even so, the Constitution places significant
limits on the right to strike to ensure that essential public
services are never interrupted by labor disputes.
     The country's labor code states that workers in public
health services, sanitation, the energy sector, and water
services cannot strike unless they first make arrangements for
those services to continue without interruption.  And, for any
civil-servant strike to be deemed "legal," the union in a
given state ministry or institute must first petition the
courts for a "strike permit."  Without such a permit, any
decision to walk off the job is considered illegal and
adequate justification for dismissal or other punitive action.
     Nevertheless, since 1986 there have been only a few
instances in which public-sector unions have successfully
petitioned the courts for a strike permit.  In most cases, the
legal process takes many months--sometimes years--before a
judgement is forthcoming, forcing the unions to carry out de
facto strikes to push their demands.  As a result, essential
services, such as those provided by hospitals and health
clinics, have frequently been shut down during strikes,
generating ongoing debate about the country's labor laws.
     Since President Alvaro Arzu took office in January, the
debate has gained momentum, in part because of a series of
public-sector labor disputes that exploded this year.  In
January, for example, workers at two huge state hospitals in
Guatemala City--San Juan de Dios and Roosevelt--shut down
outpatient services to press for wage hikes, and they
threatened to mount a nationwide general strike if the
government did not open negotiations with them (see Chronicle
of Latin American Economic Affairs, 02/29/96).
     Beginning in mid-March, the country's 3,700-member
Sindicato de Trabajadores del Organismo Judicial (STOJ)
paralyzed the country's entire judicial system for three weeks
to press for wage hikes and approval of a new collective
bargaining agreement that the union had been negotiating with
the Supreme Court (Corte Suprema de Justicia, CSJ) since March
1995.  The STOJ had petitioned the courts for a strike permit,
but given the slow progress of the request, plus the CSJ's
refusal to accept a wage hike in negotiations, the union
decided to forfeit legal permission and press forward with the
walkout.
     During the three weeks that it lasted, the strike gripped
public attention since it completely shut down the courts
throughout the country, leading to huge conflicts in some
towns and villages where criminals were caught by police but
then set free because the judiciary was inoperative.  In about
a dozen cases, local mobs took justice into their own hands.
A total of six men were lynched, and in four of the cases,
angry citizens burned the bodies of the victims after killing
them.
     Given the public backlash against the strike, the CSJ
hardened its position and successfully petitioned the courts
to declare the strike illegal.  Under threat of dismissal,
STOJ members finally returned to work on April 8 without any
of their demands being met.
     The conflict in the judiciary, however, emboldened the
Arzu administration to push forward with legislation to
further restrict union rights among civil servants.  On April
9, the day after the STOJ went back to work, the governing
party introduced a bill in Congress that would make it illegal
to even partially shut down public services in some ministries
and institutes under any circumstances, and to make legal
action against civil servants who strike without a permit much
faster and easier.
     In particular, the bill prohibits strikes in about a
dozen public sectors, including health, sanitation,
telecommunications, energy generation and distribution,
aeronautics, postal and telegraph services, the judiciary, the
security forces, urban and rural transportation, and water
distribution.  It also allows the executive to extend the
strike prohibition by decree to include other public
ministries and institutes if the government deems that a labor
walkout will seriously affect the national economy or if it
represents a grave risk to the public.  And, in those cases
where a union does strike without a legal permit, the bill
gives authorities the right to fire the striking workers
without need for court approval.
     The government says that the bill is part of a much
broader government plan to modernize the state.  According to
Vice President Luis Flores Asturias, in addition to the labor
bill, the Arzu administration is preparing a series of
complementary public-sector reforms to reduce bureaucracy and
increase government efficiency.  The reforms include a plan to
significantly cut back the civil servant work force.
     The government is now negotiating a loan with the World
Bank to finance a "voluntary retirement" plan whereby public-
sector employees would be given incentives to leave their
jobs.  The goal, according to Flores, is to reconcentrate the
responsibility for public services in the hands of a much
leaner and more technically qualified work force.  By reducing
the payroll, the government could offer better wages for those
who remain, thereby attracting better trained professionals
who would be more efficient at their jobs.
     "What we want is a smaller number of employees who will
be paid larger salaries that match their qualifications, both
technical and academic," said Flores.  "The modernization
program is still in the planning stages.  In the coming months
we will send proposals to Congress for approval with the goal
of implementing the full program at the beginning of next
year."
     Nevertheless, although reaction to other components of
the modernization plan remains to be seen, the labor-reform
bill has generated fierce disagreement since it was introduced
in Congress, not just within the country's labor movement, but
among most of the opposition parties in the legislature.  In
part, the criticism stems from the authoritarian approach
taken by PAN, which controls 43 of the 80 seats in the
unicameral Congress.  (Cont.)

GUATEMALA: NEW LAW LIMITING UNION RIGHTS FOR
CIVIL SERVANTS PROVOKES HUGE LABOR PROTESTS (Part 2)

     PAN has used its legislative majority to limit all debate
on the bill, discarding suggestions by the opposition that
labor leaders be consulted, or that the Constitutional Court
first be given an opportunity to rule on whether the bill
would violate the Magna Carta.  As a result, on May 23 PAN
unilaterally approved the bill against the unanimous
opposition of the remaining 37 congressional representatives,
generating harsh criticism from opposition parties.
     "A party dictatorship has been implanted in Congress
where laws are simply approved by PAN representatives without
even the slightest interest in listening to the opinion of
legislators from the other parties," said Aristides Villatoro
of the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), the second
largest party in Congress.
     In fact, the president of Congress, PAN leader Carlos
Garcia Regas, prohibited the public from being present in the
legislature when the bill came up for a vote.  Garcia hoped
that measure would block union leaders and activists from
filling the legislative auditorium in protest.
     In Guatemala, a bill must be passed in three consecutive
votes in Congress to become law.  On May 21, when the bill
came up for a second vote, Garcia Regas ordered the doors of
Congress shut to the public.
     In retaliation, about 300 labor leaders from the
Federacion Nacional de Trabajadores del Estado (FENASTEG) and
the Unidad de Accion Sindical y Popular (UASP) forced their
way into the building and held a sit-in in the voting chamber.
The activists refused to leave until 1,000 police officers and
army soldiers surrounded Congress and threatened to forcibly
remove them.
     When the bill received final approval in a third-round
vote on May 23, Congress remained under heavy guard by the
army and police, including four armored cars sent by the
military's Guardia de Honor, one of the largest bases in the
capital.
     According to labor leaders, the approval of the law has
encouraged the country's unions to take a much more aggressive
stance vis-a-vis the Arzu administration.  FENASTEG and the
UASP are planning massive demonstrations during the month of
June to protest the government's anti-union policies.
     "This law is part of a broad government offensive to roll
back the basic freedom of workers to organize unions, to
negotiate collectively, and to strike," said UASP leader
Sergio Guzman.
     Moreover, the unions believe that, in addition to
restricting union freedoms in general, the labor reform is
specifically aimed at paving the way for the privatization of
state firms and institutes in Guatemala by eliminating the
ability of public-sector unions to fight back.
     "This is the first step toward privatization in
Guatemala," said Guzman.  "The government is attempting to
clear the path for powerful private groups to take control of
state services, all of which tends toward the imposition of a
neoliberal model in Guatemala."
     Until now, adamant union opposition had prevented
consecutive governments from privatizing strategic state firms
in Guatemala, such as the telephone company Empresa
Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL) and the electric
firms Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE) and Empresa
Electrica de Guatemala (EEGSA).  In late April, however, the
Arzu administration announced plans to move forward with the
"demonopolization" of GUATEL, and possibly INDE and EEGSA as
well (see Chronicle, 05/16/96).
     That, in turn, has radicalized union opposition.  At this
year's May Day demonstration, union leaders made opposition to
privatization a central theme of the march in the capital,
attended by about 10,000 workers.  During the rally, the
GUATEL union burned a huge artificial loaf of bread in effigy
of the governing PAN, which means "bread" in Spanish.
According to the union, the act was also a symbolic
demonstration that workers will not allow the governing party
nor the private sector to "gobble up" public patrimony.
     Perhaps more important, Guatemalan unions are now, for
the first time, seeking to forge an alliance with unions in
other Central American countries to create a regional movement
against privatization.  The week prior to May Day, the
telecommunications and electricity-sector unions from
Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua met in San Salvador,
where they formed the Federacion Centroamericana de
Trabajadores de las Telecomunicaciones y de la Energia
Electrica (FESTEN).
     FESTEN is aimed at forging a "common front" against plans
by regional governments to sell off telecommunications and
electricity institutes, which is a stated goal of nearly all
the isthmian administrations.  FESTEN member unions will
organize simultaneous actions in their individual countries,
including strikes, demonstrations, educational campaigns, and
lobbying of diplomatic entities.  The unions from those three
nations will also seek to incorporate telecommunications and
energy-sector unions from Costa Rica, Panama, and Honduras.
     "FESTEN's creation is necessary because the problem of
privatization is exactly the same in all the Central American
countries," said Orlando Aguillon, secretary general of the
Salvadoran electricity workers union Asociacion de
Trabajadores de la Comision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (ATCEL).
     According to Nicaraguan labor leader Ronald Membreno, the
goal is not to halt privatization programs outright since such
an objective is unrealistic.  Rather, FESTEN hopes to
influence the process to make the outcome more favorable to
workers and lower-income groups.
     "We are aware that we will not be able to reverse the
privatization process in Central America since it is a plan
that is being imposed on local governments by international
lending institutions," said Membreno.  "But we can
energetically oppose the process to reduce the negative
effects of privatization as much as possible."  [Sources:

HONDURAS: U.S. IMPOSES EMBARGO ON HONDURAN SHRIMP IMPORTS

     On May 1, the US ordered its market closed to shrimp
imports from 49 countries, including Honduras.
Environmentalists say that shrimp from these countries are
caught in nets that simultaneously capture and kill sea
turtles, an endangered species.  Honduran officials, however,
expect the embargo to be lifted within a few weeks, after an
inspection team from the US certifies that Honduran shrimp
boats are equipped with turtle-safe nets.
     In 1993, owners of shrimp fleets in Caribbean Basin
countries agreed to switch to the use of nets equipped with
metallic turtle-excluder devices (TED), which allow turtles
entangled in the net to escape.  But environmental
organizations complained to the US State Department that there
was little or no compliance.
     Following announcement of the embargo, Honduran vice
minister of economy Edwin Araque admitted in a press
conference that the Honduran shrimp industry had indeed failed
to equip its boats with turtle-safe nets.  As a result, the
economy is threatened with an enormous loss of hard currency
from shrimp exports.  Shrimp is the most profitable
nontraditional export and third among all Honduran exports,
earning about US$120 million per year in foreign exchange.
     The embargo is only against shrimp caught at sea, which
will affect the Honduran catch from the Islas de la Bahia
region along the northern Caribbean coast.
     However, shrimp cultivated in tanks in the Gulf of
Fonseca on the Pacific coast, which account for 75% of
Honduran shrimp exports, will continue to be admitted to the
US market, but their origin must be certified.  Araque
estimated the loss in hard currency at US$40 million per year
if the embargo is not lifted.
     The embargo went into effect on May 1, but the US quickly
granted a reprieve until June 15.  During that time, a
commission will be sent to Honduras to verify that the shrimp
boats are being equipped with the required nets.
     The Honduran government has taken immediate steps to
avoid implementation of the embargo.  On May 9, the department
of fish and aquiculture (Direccion General de Pesca y
Acuicultura, DIGEPESCA) issued an order prohibiting the use of
the old nets.
     "By next week, no product from the [Caribbean] zone can
leave the country if it does not have a certificate showing
that it uses dragnets with excluder devices," said Marco Polo
Micheletti, vice minister of natural resources.
     The navy and merchant marine will enforce the order, and
violators will loose their licenses, said Micheletti.
     The ministry expects the cost of the new nets to be
absorbed by the shrimp industry.  The bill for equipping the
entire shrimp fleet of 125 boats would be about US$600,000,
far less than the US$40 million loss the embargo would cause,
said Micheletti.
     The US has issued embargo warnings against 50 nations in
all, but has so far excluded 11 Latin American countries that
have taken steps to require the use of the new nets.  Belize,
Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama, Venezuela, and Trinidad and Tobago have all
been certified by the US as being in compliance with the
turtle-safe requirement.
     In a related incident, local press reports in Tegucigalpa
say that US diplomatic representatives in Honduras suspect
that shrimp boats are being used by drug traffickers to
smuggle cocaine into the US.  The attorney general's office
has asked the US to supply information on the matter.

NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 1)

     While coffee and a few nontraditional crops are bringing
good prices on the world market, Nicaragua's agricultural
sector is in crisis, largely because of insufficient credit.
Growers blame government policies, which they say withhold
assistance to agriculture while favoring selected industries.
The government argues that the problem is not one of credit,
but of overdue debt.
     Nicaraguan agriculture has shown positive growth for the
past two years, both in profitability and amount of land under
cultivation.  This growth is largely due to high prices for
some commodities and an increase in crop diversification.
Coffee output in 1995, for example, grew by 32% over the 1994
level.  Growers of nontraditional crops have been steadily
putting more land under cultivation in tropical fruits,
cotton, and flowers.  The area devoted to the production of
melons for export to the US and Europe increased by more than
9% between 1994 and 1995.
     However, even growers of nontraditional crops, which are
aimed primarily at the export market, do not have adequate
capital to expand and keep up with changing technology.
Rodolfo Delgado, director of the Nicaraguan investment fund,
Financiera Nicaraguense de Inversiones (FNI), said that the
most profitable products--such as tobacco, peanuts, and
sesame--need US$89.6 million in credit for the 1996-1997
growing season, but only US$60 million is available.
According to Delgado, the credit shortage last year prevented
80% of the sesame growers from planting.  FNI is looking to
European lenders to fill the gap.
     Not surprisingly, the credit shortage has become a
serious point of contention between growers and the
government.  Associations representing farmers, ranchers, and
other agricultural segments accuse the government of
strangling their livelihood through adverse policies.  For
example, during the 1996-1997 season, the government's
development bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, BANADES) will
make only US$30.4 million in agricultural loans.  Any
additional amount, according to Central Bank President Jose
Taboada, will have to come from funds recovered from overdue
debt.
     But according to Amilcar Navarro, head of the farmers and
cattle ranchers organization (Union Nacional de Agricultores
y Ganaderos, UNAG), the credit demand for the season is more
than US$164 million.  He said that 80% of those who want
credit will not get it and that the private banks are too
conservative to extend credit to small producers during the
present economic crisis.
     Furthermore, the cost of credit is prohibitively high for
a majority of the producers and nearly impossible for those
with overdue debt.  Interest and other bank charges are
problems, as well as the controlled monthly devaluation of the
currency against the US dollar, since loans are calculated in
dollar terms.  These factors have pushed the real cost of
borrowing as high as 40% on commercial bank loans and somewhat
less for state bank loans.  Some growers turn to exporters and
other intermediaries for credit but at usurious interest
rates.
     The western department of Chinandega has been hard hit by
the crisis.  Growers there continue to cultivate sugar cane
and other traditional crops but have also tried planting
nontraditionals such as peanuts, soy, sorghum, and cotton.
These crops may offer a greater return on investment than the
traditional crops, but producers need credit to make the
changeover.
     Some relief came in mid-March, when the regional Banco de
America Central (BAC) offered to finance cultivation of 1,400
hectares of sugar cane in Chinandega.  The aid would be in the
form of short-term credits at 14% interest, which is ten
percentage points below interest rates charged by the state
banks.
     But the BAC loans will not help the poorest and most
indebted campesinos.  Nor will financing 1,400 ha go far to
reactivate agriculture in Chinandega, since nearly 280,000 ha
need assistance, according to UNAG.
     Writing in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada, Navarro
said that government policy was slowly killing the
agricultural sector.  Navarro said that the government
collection agency Cobranzas de Nicaragua (COBANICSA),
nicknamed the Cobra, "is designed to do away with agriculture
in our country."
     Although the Cobra is supposed to foreclose on the larger
producers, who owe the most money, it is also a threat to the
smaller growers.  Critics of the Cobra say that foreclosures
will eventually lead to severe social unrest and violence,
without either reducing the debt or rejuvenating the
agricultural sector.
     "What good is the Cobra if there is no credit?" asked
Navarro.  "Furthermore, what good is credit if it is a
suicidal act to take it when you can't pay it back?  What good
is it to lower interest rates if trade policy allows imports
to compete advantageously against our products?  And what good
is it to regulate imports if fiscal policy is loading us up
with taxes?"
     The UNAG demanded in March that the government provide
sufficient credits for the 1996-1997 growing season.
According to Juan Betancourth, president of UNAG in
Chinandega, 12,000 small and medium-size growers in the
department have been unable to get credit from BANADES.  Small
amounts of financial aid from nongovernmental organizations
have been the main sources of financing.  As a result of the
credit shortage some 269,000 ha of cultivable land are idle
and 60,000 campesinos are finding it difficult or impossible
to meet their basic needs, says Betancourth.
     Besides the financial hurdles campesinos face,
Betancourth notes that many do not have legal title to their
land.  Without titles, banks will not lend money even when it
is available.  Therefore, the organization has also demanded
that the government legalize ownership of 14,000 ha for which
it has not yet granted title.  (Cont.)

NICARAGUA: AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CONFRONTS A CREDIT CRISIS (Part 2)

     On the national level, growers and ranchers associations
petitioned the National Assembly in March to pass two bills
that they believe will reactivate the depressed agricultural
sector.  One proposal, submitted by an alliance of ranchers,
merchants, and manufacturers, is intended to revive the
economy in general.  The text of the proposal describes the
productive elements of the economy as "in complete
abandonment."
     The law would mandate a declaration that the
"rehabilitation" of agriculture and industry is "of national
interest."  The state banks would then be required to
negotiate favorable terms of repayment for those in both
sectors who carry overdue debt of less than US$365,000.  The
proposal contemplates the refinancing of these debts and
suspension of any seizure of the debtors' property.
     The other proposal, submitted by the coffee growers
association Union Nicaraguense de Cafetaleros (UNICAFE), is
intended to improve market prices for coffee and increase
producer profit.
     "Producers have been forced by conditions of poverty to
sell their coffee at a disadvantageous price," reads the
proposal.
     Most Nicaraguan coffee is grown by small and medium-sized
producers who do not have enough clout to protect their
interests in dealing with importers of machinery and supplies,
coffee exporters, banks, tax collectors, and other
intermediaries in the coffee production and marketing chain.
     The law would set up a national coffee council (Consejo
Nicaraguense del Cafe), made up of Central Bank and other
government officials plus representatives from UNICAFE and the
coffee exporters.  The council would negotiate equitable
business terms among all participants in the industry. In
addition, the law would establish a fund to stabilize prices
(Fondo de Estabilizacion y Fomento), capitalized by a tax on
coffee sales.
     The credit crunch is not the only problem facing the
smaller agricultural producers.  The movement toward free
trade means drastic reductions in tariff protection for
agriculture.  At the same time, growers are burdened with new
or higher taxes on inputs such as machinery and fertilizers.
In addition, government efforts to favor one or another
domestic industry to make the Nicaraguan economy competitive
in the global marketplace have provoked other concerns in the
agricultural sector.
     Cattle ranchers complain that these policies have helped
reduce their herds to dangerously low levels.  The cost of
inputs has risen year by year, but export prices have varied
little in the last 20 years, according to Lorenzo Arguello of
the ranchers organization Comision Nacional Ganadera
(CONAGAN).
     Ranchers and meatpackers have protested government
policies that favor tanneries by holding down the price of
domestically produced hides and by collecting a 25% custom
duty on imported leather.  Alfredo Marin, president of the
meatpackers association (Asociacion de Mataderos), said that
it was unjust to sacrifice these two productive sectors, which
generate 100,000 jobs, to indulge 30 tanneries, which employ
only 500.
     CONAGAN leaders say that while ranchers are struggling
with insufficient credit to overcome the obstacles of high
costs and low prices, the government is negotiating for beef
imports from Argentina.
     CONAGAN is also lobbying in the Assembly against a bill
intended to foster economic stability, investments, and
employment.  The organization argues that the bill would do
none of these things.  Among other provisions, it would
rapidly lower import duties but would offer no assistance to
agriculture to make it more productive and competitive.
     Another drag on the cattle industry is a 2% tax that
ranchers must pay on their tangible assets and inventory.
Cattle ranchers argue that they have low profit margins
compared to the fixed costs of their assets and that such
taxes are the "coup de grace" for the industry.  Instead,
CONAGAN is asking the Assembly's committee on economic policy
to offer real economic incentives to ranching.
     In contrast to the pessimism among these producer
associations, government officials are uniformly optimistic
about the economy and see the basic problem in agriculture as
its inefficiency and lack of global competitiveness.
     Cabinet officials and government economists are
predicting a strong 5% growth in GDP for 1996, and along with
it continued growth in agricultural output.  As for credit,
they say that domestic savings is on the upswing, growing 17%
faster this year than in 1995.  As a result, there is ample
credit available--some US$608 million--says Mario Flores,
general manager of the Central Bank.  The problem is not a
lack of funds but rather the borrowers' "culture of not
paying," he said.
     "It's the quality of the borrowers, problems of
productivity, poor management, and low profitability of the
projects," said Flores.
     When asked what he thought of proposals to restructure
the debt, Flores said that if adopted, such proposals would
break the Nicaraguan banks.
     The government's policy is to avoid a collapse of the
Central Bank brought on by bad debt.  Some 30,000 producers
are in arrears in their payments and the total overdue debt to
state banks is now US$182.5 million.  Until debtors liquidate
their obligations, they will not be eligible for additional
state bank credit, said Central Bank president Taboada.  Bank
policy for the future will be to loan only to small and
medium-size producers.  It is the big growers who have the
biggest state-bank debts. About 200 of them account for 80% of
the nation's overdue agricultural debt owed to the state
banks.  However, by most accounts few of the 30,000 debtors
will be eligible for additional state credit during the
current growing season.
     To Flores and Taboada, the credit crunch, if not the
general crisis on the farm, is caused by mismanagement or
outright fraudulent use of credit.  But the president of the
UNAG chapter in Masaya department, Jose Martinez, pointed out
that the government was also a debtor begging for debt relief.
     "President Violeta de Chamorro's government received a
pardon of 80% of its foreign debt with the Paris Club," said
Martinez.  "So, the growers are proposing that the interest on
the debt they have with the state banks be reduced and the
term extended to 15 years."  (Sources: La Prensa, 03/21/96,

PROPOSALS FOR THE FINAL STAGE OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION

from EUROPEAN INSIGHT, 18 October 1996, No. 720

On October 16, the European Commission unveiled proposals on the stability
pact meant to maintain budgetary discipline in the countries of the Euro
zone, on the legal status of the single currency and on procedures aimed
at strengthening convergence in the Member States that do not participate
in the final phase of Economic and Monetary Union from the outset
("pre-ins"). The Commission is preparing draft Regulations and a
Communication to be submitted to the Council of Finance Ministers in
November and December so that the Dublin Summit on December 13 and 14 can
proceed with the final adoption of the architecture of the future Monetary
Union, set to come into being on January 1, 1999. These proposals will
take into account the conclusions of the informal Finance Council held in
Dublin on September 20 and 21 and the meeting of the EU's influential
Monetary Committee on October 8.

Legal status of the Euro

A pair of draft Regulations designed to guarantee the continuity of
contracts denominated in national currencies and offer legal security to
Euro users, between January 1, 1999 (the start of the final stage of
Economic and Monetary Union) and the complete demise of national
currencies (no later than six months after January 1, 2002) were approved
by the European Commission The first Regulation clearly confirms the
continuity of legal instruments, not least contracts, would be ensured
between the older national currencies and the Euro and between the ECU and
the Euro. It specifies in Article 2 that as soon as EMU stage three comes
into being any reference to the ECU shall be replaced by a reference to
the Euro. The conversion rate is one Euro for one ECU. Starting on January
1, Regulation 3320/94, which fixes the composition of the ECU basket of
currencies, will be repealed. Article 3 of the proposal says the Euro does
not allow a party to a legal instrument the right to change it or
unilaterally cancel it. As for conversion rates, Article 4 envisages four
specific provisions:

- Conversion rates express the value of one Euro in each of the national
currencies taking part in the process. They comprise six key figures; -
The rates may not be rounded off nor truncated during conversion; - They
are used for conversion between the Euro unit and national monetary units
or the other way round. Reverse rates calculated on the basis of
conversion rates may not be used; - Any amount to be converted from a
national monetary unit into another has first of all to be converted into
a Euro-denominated monetary amount, rounded off to three decimals then
converted into the other national monetary unit. The second Regulation
provides that the single currency will be divided into100 sub-divisions
called "cents" and will expressly include the list of countries taking
part in the final phase. During the transitional period, due to get under
way on January 1, 1999, and end on December 31, 2001 at the latest, the
Member States will be entitled to convert outstanding amounts of debts
(bonds and loan securities) denominated in a national currency unit. The
markets could also replace the national currency in the accounts of their
operating procedures by the Euro. Notes and coins denominated in a
national currency unit keep their legal rates within the countries
concerned during the above-mentioned transitional period. By January 1,
2002 at the latest, the ECB and the central banks of the participating
countries would place Euro-denominated notes into circulation (notes and
coins may be introduced for practical reasons before the end of the
transitional period). Six months after the end of the transitional period,
national currencies would cease to be legal tender.

Stability pact.

The EMU stability pact will be based on two draft Regulations defining a
system of sanctions for countries violating the criteria (as provided for
in Article 104c of the Maastricht Treaty) and will establish a system of
reinforced convergence via stability programmes to prevent budgetary
excesses on the part of the countries of the Euro zone. The Regulation on
sanctions is to take effect on January 1, 1999, while that on reinforced
convergence is scheduled to enter into force on July 1, 1998. The
Commission provides for each Member State participating in EMU to present
a compulsory and regularly updated stability programme setting out
medium-term macro-economic objectives. These programmes will be made
public in the interests of transparency. The stability programme will
commit the Member States to correcting any budgetary excesses. An early
warning system will also be introduced, based on the stability programme
and provisions for implementation established by the Commission, to put a
halt to any slippage of the budget deficit well before it reaches the
maximum value of 3% of GDP. If, despite warnings, a Member State's
financial position continues to deteriorate, the Council of Ministers may
decide to apply the sanctions procedure. If, in fact, an excessive deficit
does exist, the Council will immediately address recommendations to the
Member State in question and give it a deadline for correcting the
situation. The Member State will have ten months from the time of
determination of an excessive deficit to take the necessary action before
sanctions are imposed. The first penalty would be applied in the form of a
non-interest-bearing deposit, comprising a fixed part (0.2% of GDP) and a
variable part (0.1%) of GDP per deficit point higher than the 3% budget
deficit limit. A maximum penalty value equal to 0.5% of GDP will
theoretically be chosen. The afore-mentioned final figures might well be
revised between now and the Commission meeting on October 16. If the
Member States fail to cut their excessive deficits dow

 to size within two years, the deposit would be converted into a fine.

The European Commission has adopted a communication to the Council on
reinforced convergence procedures and a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The ERM will be a temporary waiting room for countries preparing to join
monetary union. In line with the recommendations of the European Monetary
Institute (EMI), there is a broad consensus among Member States on a "hub
and spoke" arrangement of bilateral links between the Euro and pre-in
currencies. The fluctuation margins will in general be relatively wide,
with the possibility of closer links for countries with sufficiently
strong convergence performance: intervention by the European Central Bank
will be automatic at the margin of the fluctuation bands. However, it may
be suspended (and realignment discussions initiated) where the level of
intervention is incompatible with a monetary policy geared towards price
stability.

Building on existing procedures for the examination of national
convergence programmes and multilateral surveillance of economic policies
(under Article 103 of the Treaty), the Commission envisages the following
innovations:

- all pre-ins would be formally obliged to submit convergence programmes.

- the first programmes in this new generation would be submitted before 1
January 1999.

they would be updated annually.

- convergence programmes would contain more detail than at present, in
particular on the measures envisaged to achieve the convergence objectives
in terms of public finances, inflation and exchange rate stability. They
might also contain indications of the supplementary action envisaged to
correct any slippage from agreed targets.

a more precise timetable would be set for the examination of national
programmes by the Council.

- the Council would have the right to endorse a country's convergence
programme after detailed examination and analysis by the Commission and
the Monetary Committee (which will be succeeded by the Economic and
Financial Committee on 1 January 1999).

- the Council would exploit to the full the procedures of Article 103 of
the Treaty, in particular the possibility to make policy recommendations
(if appropriate publicly) to countries whose economic performance deviates
from agreed objectives.

GETTING CYPRUS-REGISTERED SHIPS TO TOE THE LINE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union is leaning on the Republic of Cyprus, which boasts the
world's fourth biggest merchant shipping fleet, to align its shipping
policy with the EU's, before joining the European Union. On a visit to
Cyprus on October 18, Neil Kinnock, European Commissioner for Transport,
stressed that what the EU mainly had in mind were standards for shipping
safety and the flags of convenience policy, making it easy for foreign
ships to register in Cyprus. "This is of particular importance for us,
given the size of the Cypriot fleet, which is currently the world's fourth
largest fleet and expanding rapidly, and because of the large number of
vessels which belong to EU companies yet fly the Cypriot flag", according
to Mr Kinnock, who was in Nicosia to take part in a conference of European
maritime experts. The Commissioner claims that because of Cyprus'
potential EU membership (a matter that will be considered in 1998), the
Commission is obliged to ensure high safety standards at sea as well as
fair competition in the merchant shipping industry. Mr Kinnock was thus
making a veiled criticism of the country's lax attitude to ship
registration.

The tonnage of the Cypriot merchant fleet totalled 38.3 million in 1994,
but nearly 80% of the Cyprus-registered tonnage was over 15 years of age.
By way of comparison, 45% of Liberia's fleet, the biggest in the world, is
less than five years old.

STOP PRESS: HUMANITARIAN AID MUST GET THROUGH IN ZAIRE, BONINO SAYS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino launched an urgent appeal on
October 25 to the groups fighting around the border region of Zaire and
Rwanda to let humanitarian aid through to the 1.2 million refugees
affected by the crisis, and said the international community had to make
it clear to those launching the attacks that a new genocide in the region
will not be tolerated. She also criticised the functioning of the EU's
foreign and security policy, saying that it was not able to effectively
seek solutions to the problem, and pleaded for an acceleration in the
procedures needed to release emergency budgetary reserves in response to
the crisis.

The refugees have been grouped mainly in camps around the cities of Goma,
Bukavu and Uvira in eastern Zaire. Following the outbreak of the fighting
between the Zairean army and Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, all of the 190,000
people in the 12 camps around Uvira have fled and, along with tens of
thousands of the Zairean population, are taking to the hills in Zaire or
on their way to Bukavu. Painting a bleak picture, Commissioner Bonino said
the rebels - which she says seem to be following an organised plan to
destabilise the Hutu refugee camps - are also advancing toward Bukavu,
causing thousands to begin to flee camps in that area.

While food stocks for several weeks exist around Bukavu and the European
Community Humanitarian Office and other bodies are preparing to establish
other emergency measures, such as food drops, the resources will be put
under considerable stress if most of the refugees from Uvira reach the
camps. However, even this is uncertain, the Commissioner said, because
access to camps around Bukavu and Goma are being blocked by the army or
the rebels, and humanitarian workers are unable to reach them.

EU/MEDITERRANEAN STATES: INTERMEDIATE REPORT ON MEDA ACTIONS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Of the ECU 4.685 billion in EU subsidies earmarked for the
Euro-Mediterranean partnership for the period 1995-99, ECU 414 million had
been allocated by October 1, 1996 to bilateral actions and projects, and
ECU 30 million to regional activities and projects. These figures are
contained in an interim report published by the European Commission on
October 24. Euro-Mediterranean funding for regional projects and
activities extends to five areas: Barcelona process projects, economic
cooperation, decentralised cooperation programmes, information technology
and media projects, and projects concerning cultural heritage, as well as
to the MEDA Democracy programme.

Economic cooperation.

ECU 20 million has been granted this year to the MEDSTAT regional
cooperation project involving Eurostat (the Statistical Office of the
European Communities), and the statistics institutes of the twelve
Mediterranean partners and the fifteen EU Member States. Subsidies have
also been granted to events aimed at nurturing business contracts between
small and medium-sized enterprises in Mediterranean third countries and
the EU: "Med Interprise Bethlehem" (February 1996), "Med Interprise Cairo"
(May 1996), "Med Interprise Algeria" (scheduled for December 1996) and at
involving Mediterranean countries in the Europartnership events in Lulea
(June 1996) and Genoa (November 1996). A frame-work contract has been
drawn up to cover the short term hiring of experts for the preparation of
economic cooperation projects (ECU 2 million)

Decentralised cooperation.

ECU 37 million has been granted to the "Med Campus" (cooperation between
universities), "Med Urbs" (cooperation between local authorities), and
"Med Media" (media cooperation) programmes. A further programme, "Med
Techno", involved with technological cooperation will be launched shortly.

Culture and media.

Following the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Ministers of Culture in
Bologna in April 1996, and the meeting of experts on cultural heritage in
Brussels in September (both meetings were financed under the "Barcelona
process"), a initial list of 14 joint projects is being drawn up for
financing in 1996 or the beginning of 1997. Funding granted to these
projects will depend on fine details, notably the number of countries
participating in each project. In addition, two training projects have
been provisionally financed under the Med Media programme, and a subsidy
granted for the dissemination of information on the Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership through Maghreb radio station Medi 1 (set up in the Moroccan
city of Tangiers).

Democracy.

Financed through a separate MEDA budget line, implementation of the MEDA
Democracy programme began in 1996 with subsidies totalling more than ECU 6
million granted to 32 projects.

Miscellaneous.

Other activities benefiting from regional funding through MEDA include:
support for the REDWG Secretariat (Regional Economic Development Working
Group, chaired by the European Union) in Amman (ECU 400,000), the
Euro-Arab Management School in Granada (ECU 400,000), and "micro-actions"
(ECU 1.8 million). A total of ECU 1.7 million has been granted over 1996
to the preparation and organisation of sectoral meetings at Ministerial
level and among experts in the following fields: culture, the information
society, energy, small and medium sized enterprises, investment, cultural
heritage, shipping, water management, foreign policy institutes and the
instruction of diplomats.

MEPS CRITICISE BP ROLE IN COLOMBIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament criticised human rights abuses in Colombia on
October 24 and asked that an unpublished Government Human Rights
Commission report on the activities of British Petroleum, which MEPs
accused during a debate of complicity in human rights abuses and
environmental damage in the Casanare region, be made public. In a
Resolution, the Parliament calls on all European oil companies to "observe
the highest standards of respect for human rights and environmental
protection, especially given the conditions of conflict in which they are
working". Backed by 127 to 62 with 7 abstentions and supported by Members
from most of the Parliament's major political groups, the Resolution says
a new dialogue should be established between the oil companies and the
community in Casanare to broker support for a new social and economic
development plan for the region.

British Socialist MEP Richard Howitt, a member of the Parliament's South
American delegation, accused BP during the debate earlier that day of
collaborating with the military in the region, saying these allegations
are backed by the Human Rights Commission report. "The report makes
accusations of the passing of secret video evidence to the military
leading to the death and disappearances of anti-oil protesters, and
suggests that military denunciations against the protesters lead to
assassinations", he said.

BP "rejects these charges completely", according to a company spokesman.
The British oil group applies the same human rights standards in Colombia
as it does in other countries, he said, and "would never ask the Colombian
military to break up a strike". BP also questions whether the report is
actually preliminary testimonies into oil industry activities in general
in two Colombian regions rather than a report on BP activities in
particular.

In its Resolution, the Parliament "condemns unreservedly all human rights
abuses committed in Colombia" by the security forces or paramilitary or
guerrilla groups. It also finds fault with the Government, calling on it
to guarantee rather than restrict press freedom in the country, to stop
the use by the army of extrajudicial and arbitrary killings, torture and
other human rights violations, to cooperate with the Colombian
Attorney-General's office in its efforts to arrest those involved in
extrajudicial killings and to continue its efforts to counter
drug-trafficking.

EU/SLOVENIA: PARLIAMENT PRESSES EU STATES TO RATIFY ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on October 23, the European
Parliament adopted reports by Bernd Posselt (EPP, Germany) on the economic
and commercial aspects of the Association Agreement between the European
Union and the Republic of Slovenia, and Ulpu Iivari (PES, Finland), on the
political aspects of this agreement, sending a clear message to Member
States to ratify the Association Agreement without delay. The Parliament
is delighted that Slovenia lodged a request for accession to the European
Union on June 10, and will therefore be placed among the vanguard of
candidates for the next enlargement.

Rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mrs Iivari observed that
adoption of an Association Agreement between the Union and Slovenia has
been a long drawn-out process. Negotiations began on March 15, 1995, with
the Agreement signed more than a year later on June 10, 1996. Negotiations
became bogged down on the fact that - historically - a part of Italy was
annexed by the former Yugoslavia. Rome insisted that Italian nationals
forced to leave Yugoslavia in the 1950s should be granted the right to
recover what real estate they abandoned. However, Slovenian legislation
and constitutional law prohibits foreigners from owning real estate. The
two parties have now settled on a compromise whereby Slovenia has agreed
to guarantee all EU citizens the right to acquire real estate from the
fourth year after the entry into force of the Agreement. In addition, EU
citizens who have resided for at least three years on Slovenian territory
(the case of Italians) will see their rights to acquire real estate
recognised from the entry into force of the Agreement.

In her report, Mrs Iivari explains that the general situation in Slovenia
is encouraging: per capita income stands at USUSD9,000 a year, and
Slovenia already meets a number of the Maastricht criteria set for
Economic and Monetary Union. The text urges the Slovenian Government to
pursue privatisation and the European Commission to provide financial
backing for redevelopment projects and encourage economic and cultural
cooperation. In his speech to the Parliament, EU External Relations
Commissioner Hans van de Broek called on the Member States' national
Parliaments to ratify the Association Agreement with Slovenia as quickly
as possible. Slovenia itself will need to amend its Constitution as regard
the acquisition of real estate, overhaul administrative structures, and
consolidate economic reforms.

Encouraging the Slovenian Government to pursue the privatisation process,
Bernd Posselt's report invites the European Commission to offer financial
support to border regions between Slovenia and the EU for redevelopment
projects to counteract the disappearance of traditional border activities,
and to encourage economic and cultural cooperation. Member States are also
urged to provide long-term backing for major infrastructure projects in
Slovenia and to include these projects in European planning for
trans-European transport networks. Finally, the report urges Slovenia to
further improve protection for minority groups.

Slovenia on the right road to EU membership.

On the eve of the European Parliament's vote, the head of the Parliament's
delegation for relations with Slovenia, Michel Ebner (EPP, Italy), said at
the end of a two-day meeting in Ljubljana that Slovenia was proceeding on
schedule for meeting the preconditions for EU membership. The encounter
was held in the context of high-level meetings with senior political
figures, including Josef Skolc, President of Slovenia's parliament, Janez
Drnovsek, Prime Minister, and Davorin Kracun, Foreign Minister. The
impression given during the meeting was that all parties what ever their
stripe were much in favour of closer ties with Europe.

The European Parliament's delegation judges that in order to ensure the
continuing possibility of early EU membership, Slovenia would have to take
steps to complete its own ratification procedure as soon as possible after
the November 10 elections. Other subjects raised at the meeting include
the EU's Inter-governmental Conference on the Maastricht Treaty reform and
the application of the PHARE programme of aid for economic reforms in
Eastern Europe, as well as a number of economic and environmental issues.
Privatisation was considered with Mr De Prikmajer, State Secretary at the
Ministry for Economic Relations and Development. The officials also mooted
the situation in Bosnia after the September 14 elections, and welcomed the
positive role that Slovenia is being called upon to play in the region.

PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR COMPLETE EU EMBARGO ON BURMA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Parliament said on October 23 that the EU should implement
economic sanctions against Burma (Myanmar) in an attempt to pressure its
military rulers, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), to
end widespread human rights violations. On the same day as Burma announced
that it had detained Kyi Maung, a top advisor to Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the Parliament condemned in a Resolution "the
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms being perpetrated
against the Burmese people".

It called in particular for the Council to "end all links between the
European Union and Burma based on trade, tourism and investment in Burma
by European companies" when it meets on October 28-29, and for the
Commission to present without delay the conclusions of its present inquiry
into withdrawing Generalised System of Preferences trade concessions from
Burma. The withdrawal of GSP, which would cost Burma tens of millions of
Dollars, is the only immediate step which may be taken to put effective
pressure on the SLORC, the Parliament said.

Meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg, the MEPs took particular aim at
foreign companies active in Burma. It expressed concern that investment in
Burma by UNOCAL and French oil group Total has caused significant
violations of human rights and indirectly led to forced relocation and
labour, and welcomed the decisions by 15 international companies to stop
investing in the country. International pressure should also be brought to
bear on the country through the United Nations, says the Resolution. The
Parliament called on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
to refuse Burma's application for membership until the SLORC has stepped
down from power, warning that "Burma's full membership would harm
relations between the EU and ASEAN".

EU/US: COMMISSION TRIES TO WRING DANISH SUPPORT FOR CUBA MEASURE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The threat of a Danish veto on the European Union's common response to the
United States' anti-Cuba laws has sent European Commission and EU Council
of Ministers officials into a frenzy as they seek to persuade the errant
Member State of the merits of their proposal. The Commission has also used
the deadlock as an argument for ending the use of a veto in EU foreign
policy.

The EU's Foreign Ministers will be meeting in Luxembourg on October 28 for
their Council and the Commission wants the common response agreed against
the so-called Helms-Burton law, by which the United States hopes to punish
companies doing business with Cuba. But Denmark appears determined to
resist the move, insisting it is not against a response as such, rather
against the legal means by which the Commission is proposing to push
through the measure. "Our position is firm and our Government clearly
indicated this in two meetings of COREPER", a Danish official said.

In fact, Denmark actually supports EU arguments against Helms-Burton, and
claims its caution is based on a potential threat to EU Members State
sovereignty thanks to the rarely-used Article 235 of the EU Treaty. The
retaliatory measures will be taken under this Article which states that
the Council has the power to act on issues not specified in other areas of
the Treaty, but can only do so by unanimity. It says: "If action by the
Community should prove necessary to attain, in the course of the operation
of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community and this
Treaty has not provided the necessary powers, the Council shall, acting
unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the
European Parliament, take appropriate measures".

Denmark says it has held misgivings about Article 235 ever since joining
the European Community in 1973, as it clashed with Article 20 of the
Danish Constitution which says the Government cannot give away too much
sovereignty. "Denmark is not against the European Union taking
precautionary measures against the USA. It's just that we cannot accept
the use of Article 235", Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said. "I
know that others are trying to find an alternative basis on which to
proceed."

Some officials in Brussels suspect Denmark's reticence on ceding authority
to the Commission is linked to a pending court case in Copenhagen on the
issue of sovereignty. A group of 11 citizens recently filed a suit
claiming the Danish Government's signature of the Maastricht Treaty on
European Union contravened the country's Constitution by transferring too
much political and judicial authority to supranational institutions. And
the sensitivity over sovereignty can also be traced to Denmark's two
referendums on the Maastricht Treaty. The Danish Government only secured
approval for the Treaty during the second referendum, in 1993, after
renegotiating Denmark's position so there could be an option on the final
stage of Economic and Monetary Union and other EU measures potentially
threatening to national sovereignty.

The European Commission discussed the problem during its weekly meeting on
October 22, and the Commission President Jacques Santer said it proved how
important it was for the EU to speak with one voice on such matters. "This
is a very concrete example which shows that we have to take decisions
quickly without unanimity", Mr Santer's spokesman said. "What is important
is that the Union establishes a joint action as soon as possible as we
risk losing our credibility on the international stage."

As for finding a way around the problem, officials appear to be looking at
all the available means within the EU's legal instruments to placate the
Danes. "We are not being dogmatic about it and we are not fixated with
Article 235", said one official. "But we have gone through the Treaty with
a fine tooth comb and we believe the combination of articles we are using
is the best."

financial cooperation and regional cooperation - these are just a sample
of the key themes due to be discussed, on October 28 in Luxembourg by EU
and Egyptian Foreign Ministers. Gathered for a Cooperation Council
meeting, the two sides are likely to focus on problems that have succeeded
in stalling the Association Agreement negotiations for several months now.
The European side believes the concessions being sought by the Egyptians,
mainly concerning farm trade, are excessive and do not reflect the real
level of trade between the two sides. Egypt wants the right to be able to
enjoy zero or reduced-rated duties for products for which they are not
traditional exporters to the EU market. (potatoes, for example). They also
want the export quota system to take account of reference years Egypt
considers are most in the country's favour. These demands are not accepted
by the European Commission or the EU Member States, who are fearful of
seeing their own producers having to compete with farm produce from Egypt.

The two sides will also be taking stock of EU financial assistance for
Egypt. Under the new MEDA financial programme for non-EU Mediterranean
countries, Egypt is slated to receive ECU 275 million for 1996. 155
million will be channelled into the Social Development Fund, 100 million
into the basic education sector and 20 million into environment causes.

EU/PALESTINE: LEON BRITTAN AND PARIS SPAT OVER PEACE PROCESS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

France is somewhat miffed over a statement that Leon Brittan European
Commissioner for External Economic Relations, made on October 24 to the
effect that the conditions are not ripe for the EU to take part in the
Middle East peace process. Why? Because the Member States are unable to
work together. He also called on the major EU countries to refrain from
taking any independent addiction in this sphere. Sir Leon was making a
veiled allusion to the role Paris wants France and the EU to play in the
Near East. Catherine Colonna, spokeswoman for the French President, said
that the Commission's words were singularly lacking in relevance. They are
not the sort of things one expects to hear from the European Commission
nor do they reflect reality, she stressed, adding that the Commission has
no powers in common foreign policy matters. Elsewhere, the Commission has
signed a three-year agreement with the UNRWA involving ECU 130 million.

On a visit to the Middle East from October 20 to 26, President Jacques
Chirac made a call for Europe to become a joint sponsor of the peace
process. The US and Russia have been the two sponsors since the peace
process got under way in October 1991 in Madrid. Sir Leon Brittan judged
that the conditions are not ripe for EU involvement. "If we succeed in
working together and we refrain from any independent action, we will then
be able to work with the US in the region. Otherwise we will not succeed
in this endeavour", he implied.

Ms Colonna stresses that policy positions on the Middle East were being
taken regularly at the highest level of the EU and that Europe is
increasingly present and active in this area via its Member States and
collectively. She recalled that before his trip to the Middle East, Mr
Chirac took care to inform his partners that he would be reporting back to
them as soon as he got home.

Aid for Palestinian refugees.

The EU is to provide the hefty sum of ECU 106 million over three years for
the UN refugees welfare Agency. UNWRA's General Commissioner, Peter Hansen
says the 4.5% increase in aid (in comparison with last year's
contribution) would help cover18% of his organisation's Budget. The EU is
the second biggest contributor to the UNWRA Budget after the US, but the
first if donations from each Member States are taken into account. The
money is used for programmes relating to food, education and health for
the 3.3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West
Bank and Gaza.

Mr Hansen says the EU aid has arrived just at the right moment, because
the UNWRA Budget is running a 15% deficit and was on the verge of having
to stop making payments. The General Commissioner is planning to make a
tour of the Arab countries to ask them to boost their contributions
(currently accounting for only 1% of the Budget). As for Israel, he is
simply asking the authorities there to facilitate the efforts being made
to deliver aid.

The aid for UNWRA is quite separate from that awarded to the Palestinian
Authority. The EU is also funding other projects such as one for a major
Palestine hospital due to open next year, for which the EU has paid ECU 20
million.

Gaza port.

During his visit to Palestine, President Chirac announced on October 23
his decision to revive the Palestinian shipping port project for Gaza.
Sponsored by the Netherlands and France, the project is supposed to result
in the port being able to handle more than one million tonnes of cargo
annually in six years' time. Mr Chirac visited the site during his visit
to the Gaza Strip. A USD1.5 million contract was signed to allow French
engineers to press on with the preparations and to help with construction
immediately after an Israeli/Palestinian agreement along these lines. "The
construction of a port in the Gaza Strip, that France has decided to fund,
together with its European partners, is an economic and political
necessity", according to Mr Chirac.

A first feasibility study, initiated with the support of Israel by the
Dutch firm Grabowsky and Poorts, was conducted by Tel Aviv University in
1990/91. The autonomy agreements signed by Israel and the PLO have, in the
meantime, conferred on the Palestinian Authority the right to its own
port. The Israelis and Palestinian have agreed upon a negotiating system
specifying their mutual approval for each of the three project phases:
studies, construction and port operations. The port exists only on paper
for the moment, but the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat, symbolically
laid the first stone last January 18 in the company of the Dutch Prime
Minister, Wim Kok. The cost of building the Gaza port is put at USD71
million, with the Netherlands supplying FF 23 million, France 19 million
and the EU (via the European Investment Bank) 29 million.

EU/LEBANON ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT LOOMING UP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Lebanon and the European Union are likely to be in a position to sign a
partnership deal before the end of the year, a European official hinted on
October 22 in Beruit. Major progress had been made in the talks, according
to Bernard Philippe, a senior European Commission official in charge of
negotiating with Lebanon. At the end of a meeting with Zafer al-Hassan, a
high-level official from the Lebanese Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mr
Philippe stressed that more talks were needed for farming, emigration and
services. Without mentioning any exact date, the EU's negotiator in Beruit
expressed confidence about a deal being struck between the two sides
before the end of the year. The talks on establishing an economic, social
and cultural partnership got under way in 1995.

EIB loan to Lebanon.

The European Investment Bank announced on October 24 an ECU 50 million
loan to Lebanon to pay for projects to combat water pollution. The loan
agreement was signed by Ariane Obolensky, Vice-Chairman of the EIB, and
Nabil Jisr, head of a Government-sponsored development and reconstruction
organisation. Carrying a 3% rate of interest, the loan forms part of
overall aid of ECU 130 million from the Lebanese Government, the World
Bank and a Japanese fund awarding money for schemes to clean up Lebanese
coastal cities. The EIB has awarded loans to the tune of ECU 300 million
for Lebanese reconstruction projects launched since the end of the
1975-1990 civil war.

EU/BULGARIA: "CONSTRUCTIVE" TECHNICAL MEETING WITH BULGARIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Despite the recent problems in Bulgaria (see European Report N   2064),
there was a conciliatory tone to the second meeting of the Association
Council, held in Brussels on October 22. Implementation of Bulgaria's
Europe Agreement is "progressing according to schedule", delegates agreed,
and the EU side - headed by Sipke Brouwer, Director for relations with
Central and East Europe in the European Commission's External Political
Relations Directorate-General, DG IA - welcomed the recent economic
stabilisation and restructuring programme from the Government, and
expressed hope that it would help sustainable long-term development.

Bulgaria's application to join the EU, its accession to the World Trade
Organisation, and its adoption of a national strategy to respond to the
1995 White Paper on rules for the Internal Market were all welcomed (and
Bulgaria also reported on its work to set up a special framework agreement
with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). There was
also recognition of Bulgaria's efforts at developing regional cooperation,
especially via the Sofia Ministerial meeting in July. Moreover, Bulgaria's
plans for enterprise and financial sector restructuring and for cash
privatisation were judged appropriate for "substantial" assistance from
the EU-coordinated PHARE programme for economic reform. The EU
acknowledged the "important steps" taken towards "economically viable"
electricity prices as a crucial aspect of energy reform.

But it was made clear that any further EU macro-financial support would be
given only if Bulgaria brings the IMF-agreed macro-economic and structural
reform programme back on track. There is a need for more agricultural
reform, too, the EU side pointed out firmly, with emphasis on new rules on
land ownership and market liberalisation. Bulgaria's recent request for
food aid to overcome a short-term cereal supply imbalance will be assessed
in the light of how many concrete steps Bulgaria shows it is ready to make
in that direction - particularly since the EU has already agreed to
facilitate planting by private farmers for the 1997 harvest.

During the meeting - where the Bulgarian delegation was led by Emil Valev,
Director of European Integration, and Peter Stefanov, the Deputy Minister
of Trade - most of the outstanding trade issues were resolved, but there
remains much to be done to meet Bulgaria's desire for greater freedom of
movement for workers. The EU also stressed the need to keep to schedule
for bringing in - and for giving real effect to - legislative
approximation, particularly in respect of competition, certification and
standards. Another urgent need, the EU side said, is for a civil service
law to promote a stable and professional public administration. And on the
sore point of visas, the current aim is to develop PHARE programmes that
will "create the conditions for a reconsideration by the EU of its visa
policy".

EU/EAST EUROPE: EU LOOKS AT ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION WITH CEECS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe
(CEECs) is not only delivering a plethora of headlines on the political
relations between the EU and its candidates. It is also bringing these
countries ever closer to EU operating methods, through a series of less
spectacular but nevertheless influential mechanisms. The meeting of EU and
CEEC Internal Market Ministers in Luxembourg on October 25 was scheduled
to look at one of the latest moves in these "back office" developments -
what goes under the prosaic title of administrative cooperation. What it
comes down to is trying to ensure that all the CEEC rule changes result in
new conditions on the ground as well as in their statute books, so that a
genuine Single Market will be brought into being with enlargement.

Administrative cooperation has already been a permanent feature of
relations between existing EU Member States for years - based on the
knowledge that no Single Market will work at all in practice without
constant common efforts to avert problems and prevent the emergence of
latent protectionism masquerading as national safeguard measures. Between
Member States, regular meetings of officials at all levels and across all
Internal Market sectors has made it possible to deal with potential
problems early, before they become serious obstacles to free movement -
and at the same time mutual confidence has been built.

These existing mechanisms within the EU include the system of prior
notification of new national measures of a technical nature (set up by
Directive 83/189) and the related procedures for assessing derogations
from rules on free movement of goods, which will come into effect from the
beginning of 1997 (under Decision 3052/95), and a new procedure for
ensuring transparency of technical standards in the framework of the
information society. They also include networks created, in line with a
number of Council Resolutions over the last two years, to establish
national contact points and information on national administrative
structures - aimed both at increasing cooperation between Member States
and at helping companies to understand their rights for cross-border
operation in the Single Market. And they include the programmes such as
Karolus, Mattheus and Mattheus Tax for exchanges between Member States of
officials working in customs and taxation.

When CEECs join the EU, their officials too will have to play an active
part in these networks. To start preparations for that time - and
particularly since few East European officials have much experience of
many of the market economy mechanisms which are at the heart of a Single
European Market - the European Commission has made a number of specific
suggestions. Bringing CEEC officials progressively into the loop will get
them ready to work fully with their new colleagues after accession, and
will in the meantime also provide them with a lot of technical help in
resolving some of the problems that their own national legislative
adaptations are presenting.

Already the TAIEX office in Brussels provides the CEECs with technical
assistance and access to expertise - including short visits, contacts with
EU Member State experts, and seminars. The Commission is also suggesting
setting up some ad hoc groups of EU and CEEC officials and experts in
specific domains - such as DG XVII is now doing for gas, where each Member
State has been asked to nominate one official and one industry expert. And
it recommends that specific meetings - such as DG XVII (again) organised
on energy matters at Director-General level in March - can be helpful.
What the Commission is seeking from all the Internal Market Ministers is
guidance on what they would themselves find most useful.

Treading carefully.

The Commission is conscious of the need for caution in such a process.
Some of the EU mechanisms for administrative cooperation also have a
decision-making (and sometimes even a legislative) role, and it would not
be appropriate for officials from non-Member States to take part, even as
observers - and there was some initial resistance from Member States to
the idea of premature cooperation. But the Commission, in its 1995 White
Paper on integrating the East Europeans into the Internal Market, already
announced its intention of suggesting some methods in which CEEC officials
might gain a better understanding of the operation of the Single Market.
Prior to the Council, Presidency sources downplayed the significance of
Member State resistance, suggesting it was based on a misunderstanding
that exaggerated the size and speed of the steps now under discussion.

EU/ZAIRE/RWANDA: EU REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL SOLUTION TO CONFLICT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

EU Development Commissioner Jo_o de Deus Pinheiro and members of the
Council's Africa Working group have thrown their support behind new
efforts to calm tensions at the border between Zaire and Rwanda that
observers fear could escalate into an all-out conflict. They met on
October 23 with Aldo Ajello, European Union envoy to the Great Lakes
region, following recent fighting between Zairean Government troops and a
Tutsi community near the frontier and a mass exodus of refugees in the
area.

EU representatives gave the envoy a mandate to proceed with attempts to
bring about a meeting as soon as possible between the Prime Ministers of
Zaire and Rwanda to defuse the situation. "A meeting was initially
scheduled for early November. All efforts possible should be deployed to
ensure it takes place despite the incidents that have taken place these
last few days in South Kivu in eastern Zaire", the Commissioner said after
his meeting with Mr Ajello. The special envoy also met Commissioner Emma
Bonino to discuss humanitarian aid. A crisis unit, set up within the
European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), will be responsible for
following the situation and deciding whether to activate any emergency
measures.

In a statement published on behalf of the EU on October 21, the Council
Presidency "urged all parties to exercise restraint and to ensure the
prevention of open conflict across the border between Zaire and Rwanda".
The EU statement, which was backed by the associated Central and Eastern
European countries, Cyprus and Malta, also supported the efforts of the
United Nations Special Representative, Ibrahima Fall, to seek a peaceful
resolution.

EU/CENTRAL AMERICA: EU PROJECTS TO AID REFUGEES IN GUATEMALA AND EL
SALVADOR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission cleared on October 23 two development aid projects
designed to help uprooted people in El Salvador and Guatemala. In El
Salvador, the ECU 4 million programme will help integrate into local
communities displaced persons, demobilised soldiers and people returning
to the department of Morazan, one of the areas worst affected by the
fighting that ended with peace agreements in 1992. In Guatemala, the EU is
putting up ECU 3.1 million to help pay for infrastructure improvements and
to promote agricultural and forest production.

In an effort to encourage self-sufficiency and sustainable development in
El Salvador in the longer term, actions under the new programme will be
targeted specifically at strengthening productive activities via a credit
system and providing specialised technical assistance and support for
marketing development and training needed to build productive
infrastructure.

Other activities carried out under the ECU 4 million programme (of which
ECU 3.6 million comes from the EU) will aid in the construction and
rehabilitation of social, health and education infrastructure and
communication routes, cleaning up the environment and the development of
technical skills and expertise. The encouragement of basic cereal
production, the creation of family kitchen gardens and livestock
production will also be priorities. Carried out jointly by the Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs in El Salvador and the European Union in
collaboration with local and European non-governmental organisations, the
project is scheduled to run for one and a half years.

The Commission has supported those uprooted by armed violence in El
Salvador since 1984, and since 1991 has provided aid to help people
resettle in Morazan from, for example, the Colomoncagua refugee camp in
Honduras. Some ECU 4.6 million has been invested in projects geared
primarily at supporting self-sufficiency in health, education,
agricultural and stock-breeding production, the installation of workshops,
and the production of textiles, leather and footwear.

Aiding peace in Guatemala.

With the November 1996 signing of an overall peace agreement in Guatemala
in view, the Commission approved a programme to help resettle communities
in the Sayaxche and La Libertad municipalities in the El Peten department
that were displaced, primarily to Mexico, by the civil war. It is designed
to foster the move towards democracy, promote socio-economic development
and create the machinery for consultation between the government and civil
society.

The ECU 4.4 million project (of which ECU 3.1 million will be provided by
the EU) will finance infrastructure and basic services construction such
as access roads, schools, health centres and drinking water systems, and
aid in agricultural and forest production, including the promotion of
permanent crops, reforestation, sustainable forest management, and the
development of other natural resources. Funding will be provided for
training in carpentry and wood craftsmanship, weaving and eco-tourism. The
project also aims to reinforce the capacity of local communities to
formulate and draw up their own development projects.

With an estimated 30 million refugees and displaced persons worldwide, the
European Commission has just published "Refugee Issues", a 36-page
document which provides an overview of EU aid in favour of displaced
persons in Africa, Latin America, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and the
CIS, the Middle East and North Africa. In 1995, ECU 725 million was
allocated to help deal with refugee crises.

CULTURE: COMMISSION TO FUND 147 PROJECTS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A total of 147 projects concerned with preservation of the European
cultural heritage will benefit from Community funding to the tune of ECU
ten million. This decision by the European Commission falls within the
framework of actions in preparation for the implementation of the Raphael
programme. This programme, which is on its way to being adopted, was the
subject of a report by Francisco Sanz Fernandez (PES, Spain) adopted by
the European Parliament, meeting in plenary session in Strasbourg on
October 22, and recommending an increase in its budget.

The European Union's activities in the area of cultural heritage
preservation expanded during the 1980s under the influence of the European
Parliament. Each year, the Commission supports projects selected for their
cultural or technical value. It also finances exhibitions and publications
vaunting Community projects and initiatives in this area. The Commission
proposed the Raphael programme on March 29, 1995, with the goal of
providing a broader and more coherent framework for activities already
under way in the area of cultural heritage.

Parliamentary report.

Introducing his report on second reading, Mr Sanz Fernandez stressed the
need to increase the programme's budget to ECU 86 million from the ECU 30
million proposed by the Council of Ministers and which he considers
inadequate in light of the programme's objectives. The report emphasised
that culture is not a luxury and that handing the European cultural
heritage down to future generations is essential. It also pointed out
cultural activities' potential for job creation. The Commission has
indicated that it recommended a budget of ECU 67 million. The rapporteur
had no objection to the Council's wish to reduce the length of the
programme from five years to four, taking into account preparatory
activities conducted in 1996.

Financing of pilot projects.

The 147 projects selected by the Commission were advanced by national,
regional and local authorities, as well as associations of private
individuals in the EU Member States. Some 25% of these projects provide
for participation by associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe
and other third countries that have Association or Cooperation Agreements
with the Union. Five distinct actions were launched:

- cooperative projects for the preservation and promotion of the European
Baroque heritage

- projects aimed at promoting the European archaeological heritage

- projects for the promotion and provision of access to the cultural
heritage of museums

- activities and/or events with a European dimension for the preservation
and increased awareness of the European cultural heritage

- supplementary training and mobility for professionals in the sector.

OPPOSITION TO COMMUNITY TRANSIT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Against the background of the war it is waging on Community transit fraud,
the European Commission is planning to increase the overall guarantee for
"non-sensitive" goods on the basis of duties and taxes paid during
delivery operations. Under the Commission proposal the guarantee would be
raised from 30 to 100% A few months ago, the guarantee was suspended for
"sensitive" goods, which are subject to high duties and taxes and are thus
a favourite target for fraudulent activities. The matter was expected to
be considered by the October 25 Internal Market Council. In view of the
proposed increase, EuroCommerce, which represents the EU's commercial
sector, has already voiced its firm opposition to a plan, saying it is
unwarranted. The association reckons that the low level of duties and
taxes to be paid for non-sensitive goods act as a disincentive to fraud.
EuroCommerce is worried about the harmful consequences for the economic
operators involved. During a public hearing held by the European
Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, Community transport operators also
stressed what a heavy burden they would have to support as a result of
increased guarantees. They are calling for more sharing of
responsibilities between the different agents in the transit chain.

AUDIOVISUAL POLICY: PARLIAMENT INDICATES SUPPORT FOR GUARANTEE FUND

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

"The Americans have managed to inculcate the entire world with their
values. Europeans must use their film industry to defend and promote the
ideals of the European Community", declared French MEP Armelle
Guineberti
re (UFE) in support of the creation of a European Guarantee
Fund for audiovisual production during a debate in the European
Parliament's plenary session. In a report adopted by the Parliament on
October 22, Mr Guineberti
re issued a moving plea for a full-scale
European response to American domination of the cinema. "A European film
industry must have resources at its disposal", she said, calling the
Guarantee Fund the answer to both a cultural and an economic need.
Amendments to the Commission's proposal were nonetheless numerous and
supported special provisions for productions in less widely-spoken
languages.

The draft Decision establishing a Guarantee Fund for the audiovisual
industry was unveiled on November 14, 1995. Under the proposed system,
banks would be granted guarantees for a portion of the loans they make to
film producers or distributors. The European Union's contribution would be
ECU 90 million, this amount to be matched by the private sector and other
public bodies. This Fund would be administered by the European Investment
Fund (EIF). It will not be easy to put into practice, given the
reservations expressed by the Council of Ministers, which must reach a
unanimous decision for the proposal to go ahead. Furthermore, as Mrs
Guineberti
re's report points out, the unresolved technical and financial
issues shed doubt on the firmness of the Member States' political will to
set up a Guarantee Fund of this kind. In any case, the Parliament plays a
merely advisory role on this proposal, which based on Article 130 of the
Treaty.

Specific strategy for SMEs.

The Audiovisual Guarantee Fund would have to take into account the demands
of the market, production issues and television rights, which do not
concern the cinema directly, but merit more consideration, the
Parliamentary report noted. Criteria for eligibility would give special
treatment to small countries, those with a less widely-spoken language and
smaller firms. The MEPs were also sceptical about the choice of the EIF to
manage the Fund. Given the specific features of this sector and the legal
and financial implications of the guarantees to be provided, an ad hoc
structure would have to be set up within the EIF to represent the European
Union's funds. However, it would be assisted by a group of professional
experts from the film industry and the world of banking, as the
"particular nature of the audiovisual sector rules out the direct
application of the EIF's own criteria", according to the report.

Mrs Guineberti
re further recommended a pilot period of five years, during
which the Fund's impact on the European audiovisual sector could be
assessed. Once its usefulness had been demonstrated, the Union could begin
to think about laying the legal foundations for its future activities.

Commission reaction.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner for the Audiovisual portfolio,
declared that he hoped the Council of Ministers will adopt the proposal
for setting up the Fund at its December 16 session on audiovisual affairs.
He indicated willingness to incorporate 21 of the Parliament's amendments,
in particular one emphasising the difficulties faced by countries with
lesser-used languages. He also supports some other amendments in
principle, including the one proposing an ad hoc structure wherein
industry professionals would be represented to administer the Fund, and
another in favour of support for SMEs and small-scale projects. However,
Mr Oreja opposes the idea of setting up the Fund for a provisional period
of five years during which its impact on the European film industry could
be assessed.

CULTURE: PARLIAMENT CALLS FOR INCREASE IN CREDITS FOR ARIANE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The financial package provided for the Ariane programme to promote books
and reading is too small, according to the European Parliament. On second
reading of a proposal on this cultural programme, the MEPs adopted a
report by Nana Mouskouri (EPP, Greece) during their October 22 plenary
session in Strasbourg.

Ariane is a programme of support for books and reading. First proposed in
November 1994 (COM(94)356), it is based on Article 128 of the Treaty
(requiring the Council of Ministers to take a unanimous decision). The
Parliament gave its Opinion on first reading in April 1995 and the Council
adopted its common position in July. As Mrs Mouskouri pointed out, this
common position changed four points of the initial proposal:

- The length of the programme was reduced from five years (1996-2000) to
two years (1994-1998), with the option of launching another programme
after an assessment of the first one, to which the rapporteur had no
objections. Pilot projects in the areas covered by Ariane had a budget of
ECU 2.5 million in 1996; this was the figure advanced by the Commission
for the first year of the programme.

- The budget was decreased from ECU 34 million over five years to ECU
seven million over two years. The Council adopted the proposals contained
in the revised version of the Commission's budget. This is unacceptable,
in the Parliament's view, if the Union wants to have a real impact on the
current situation. The Parliamentary report thus proposed a budget of ECU
10.5 million.

- While the Commission proposed setting up an Advisory Committee to
administer the programme, the Council preferred a joint Advisory and
Management Committee. The Parliament is in favour of an Advisory Committee
as initially proposed.

- The original proposal provided for three main actions, but the Council
established six priority measures. Mrs Mouskouri believes this approach
provides a clearer vision of the scope of application of the programme,
but she emphasised promotion of reading via translation of works written
in the Union's lesser-used languages.

Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner responsible for Cultural
Affairs, assured the Parliament that the Commission is particularly
sensitive to arguments concerning the need to defend minority languages,
but said he could not agree to the funding increase given budgetary
constraints.

MAD COW DISEASE: MIXED SIGNALS FROM COMMISSION ON "PROVEN" BSE/CJD LINK

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission sent out mixed signals on October 24 to news that
UK scientists may have proved a direct link between bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and a new variant of the human brain condition
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (dubbed by experts "vCJD"). Speaking at a press
conference in Paris, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said he thought
in the light of the new findings, the European Union ought to bring in
stricter legislation on consumption of animal offal, and stressed that the
UK authorities should now proceed with the planned targeted cull of some
150,000 cattle, suspended by the Major Government in mid-September.
Meanwhile back in Brussels, a Fischler aide spoke of both positive and
negative aspects of the scientific discovery. The negative side, he said,
was the obvious public health risk, now shown to be very real, that eaters
of infected beef tissue may have contracted brain disease. The positive
element consisted in the fact that the new discovery would make it easier
to trace animals incubating the disease, he stressed. Meanwhile, in
Strasbourg, Members of the European Parliament voted to extend the mandate
of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE.

BSE and vCJD prions "match".

The British scientific journal Nature carried a report on October 23 of a
new technique developed by Dr John Collinge and his colleagues in the
Prion disease Group at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, for
tracing the "molecular marker" of the prion protein which causes the brain
tissue of sufferers to degenerate into a spongy mass. "The biochemical
signature of prions in patients who died from new variant CJD matches that
of prions in mice and macaque monkeys experimentally infected with BSE,
but differs from that of prions in human patients with acquired or
sporadic CJD", says the Nature report. This finding "greatly strengthens
the conclusion that vCJD is a consequence of the BSE epidemic in British
cattle", it goes on. The new technique is likely to form the basis of a
rapid diagnostic test for spongiform encephalopathies, say the experts.

Further safety precautions?

Reacting to the news, a European Commission spokesman stressed that the EU
executive had been proceeding on the assumption of a BSE/CJD link for some
time and that all necessary measures to protect the public were already in
place. The new study would go to the EU scientific committees for
examination, and any necessary new proposals would be made on the basis of
their recommendations, the spokesman explained. However, from Paris, Franz
Fischler indicated to the press that he would be re-tabling to the Farm
Council on October 28 proposals to completely exclude from the food chain
those cattle and sheep tissues found most likely to transmit the BSE agent.

Harmonisation needed.

The legal situation regarding use of brain, eyes, spinal cord, nervous
tissues, spleen and lymph glands (shown to be capable of transmitting the
fatal prions) from cattle and sheep varies across the European Union. The
only EU-wide statute on the subject relates to UK bovine tissues, which
are banned from export. Also, ruminant waste may not be fed to cattle and
sheep, but does constitute an important ingredient in the meat and bone
meal still fed to pigs, chickens and other farm animals. The French
authorities paved the way towards tighter rules in June, when they banned
from both human foodstuffs and all animal feeds the tissues in question,
from cattle aged over 6 months and sheep and goats aged over one year.
Ireland and the UK have brought in similar regulations. Mr Fischler
believes Member States' rules should now be harmonised on the French
model. However, a proposal to that effect he tabled to the Council in July
met with little enthusiasm from the EU Standing Veterinary Committee.

The French Agriculture Ministry gave a favourable reaction on October 25
to an announcement by the Bonn authorities of a new national legislative
Bill that would, in line with French law, ban all imports from France of
the sensitive tissues. The Ministry welcomed the move, as likely to foster
EU-wide harmonisation of measures. The German Government has since July
maintained a unilateral ban on all products containing beef tissues from
the UK and Switzerland, the two main centres of the BSE epidemic in Europe.

Inquiry extended.

Meanwhile the European Parliament voted in plenary session on October 24
to extend the mandate of its Temporary Committee of Inquiry (TCI) into BSE
for another three months. The nineteen MEPs who have been interviewing
Commission staff, government officials and scientific experts since early
September feel they need more time to get to the bottom of all the
evidence, some of which seems to point to an early cover-up of the dangers
of "mad cow disease" for public health. The TCI will now produce its
report sometime in late February.

FISHERIES: PROCESSORS CALL FOR LIFTING OF FISH IMPORT TARIFFS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Union's tariffs on fish imports have been sharply criticised
in a report by the European Fish Processors Association (AIPCEE) which
argues that they raise prices to the detriment of the consumer. The report
- which calls for an end to import restrictions by quantity or by price -
says the EU now depends on imports from third countries for half its fish
consumption.

Tariffs harming EU industry's competitiveness.

European Commission sources tried to dismiss the report as irrelevant and
one-sided, but the AIPCEE, which represents the fish processing industry
in twelve EU Member States, insists that the policy implications are
clear. The report says that tariffs levied on imports harm the
competitiveness of the EU processing industry on the international market
against those processors from countries where tariffs are negligible,
especially on finished products. "The outcome of the regime can only be to
raise prices to the detriment of the consumer, the processing industry and
ultimately to the fishermen themselves through the destruction of markets."

Around 50% of total imports of fish and fishery products from third
countries are covered by imports of cod, saithe, redfish, haddock, hake
and Alaska pollack, the report says. "The supply of the EU market with
these species has to be safeguarded up to 83% by imports from third
countries like Norway, Russia, Iceland, Poland and Argentina." This means
that only 17% of total white fish supply can be met by the EU's own fleet.
The report argues that with demand outstripping supply, imports of these
stocks do not harm the EU's own fishermen. "Therefore, there is no purpose
in restricting imports by quantity or by price when supplies are not
available from EU fishermen."

The AIPCEE estimates that the supply of EU fish products amounted to 8.5
million tonnes in 1995, up 29% from 6.6 million tonnes in 1986. Over the
same period, imports from third countries nearly doubled from 2.7 million
tonnes to 5.5 million tonnes in 1995. By contrast, exports from the EU to
third countries grew only from 1.3 million tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes.
"The continuous trend towards import dependence needs to be recognised in
a further liberalisation of the conditions under which such imports from
third countries are allowed", the report says.

The report offers four policy recommendations for the European Commission
and the EU's Council of Ministers:

- decisions on tariff suspensions should be taken sufficiently in advance
to give EU enterprises time to plan their forward purchases and avoid
unnecessary costs for storage and financing;

- there should be duty free access to raw material especially when
important third countries are granted duty free access to the EU for
processed fish products;

- further reductions should be made in import duties for species which
cannot be supplied in sufficient quantities from EU catches: such reduced
duty imports should extend not only to frozen raw material, but also to
fresh fish necessary for the processing industry;

- autonomous tariff quotas should be converted for certain species into
general tariff suspensions.

More generally, the AIPCEE makes four suggestions to contribute towards
improving supplies for domestic fisheries:

- using size control to produce more selective catches: cod, saithe and
haddock catches are generally too small and of low marketing standards;

- improving quota management so that supplies are available on a reliable
and continuous basis for the filleting industry: the report says the
processing industry cannot cope with the successive gluts caused by
erratic landing patterns of EU catches;

- the plans to cut fishing capacity should be based on long-term analyses
of the conditions necessary for sustainable fishing effort;

- closer cooperation between EU fishermen and the processing industry on
measures to improve domestic supply, based on the long-term sustainable
availability of fish at world market prices.

Last March, the association called for the lifting of the Commission's
plans for fish inspection charges. It listed four reasons for rejecting
the plans: the levy would act as a tax on the fish consumer, and demand
would fall further if prices rose; fish is very safe and becomes
unpalatable before it becomes unsafe, making the checks an unnecessary
bureaucratic procedure; the need for checks can only actually be judged by
local inspectors after individual operations; and it would be impossible
to assess what a standard charge should be when the cost is not known.

BONINO TO ADDRESS SEMINAR ON FISH PRODUCTS.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Emma Bonino, the European Fisheries Commissioner will address a seminar in
The Hague on October 29 on the common organisation of the market for
fisheries products. The seminar, organised by the Commission and the
Fisheries Committee of the European Parliament, is part of the
Commission's effort to liaise with fisheries officials and hammer out the
serious problems facing the European Union's fisheries sector. The day
before the seminar, Mrs Bonino take part in a round table in The Hague on

REGIONAL POLICY: COMMISSION TIGHT-LIPPED ON COHESION REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission has been remarkably secretive about its draft
Cohesion Report, due to be released on October 31, which is expected to
provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Union's various
Structural Fund policies and its efforts to reduce regional disparities.

The services of Regional Policy Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies often
tend to be cautious about information, but there is particular reticence
about the Cohesion Report, which has involved a number of different
Directorates since the beginning of the year. Rumours about the report
suggest that it may reveal continuing disparities in certain regions, but
Commission officials are refusing to confirm or deny any speculation.

The structure of the Cohesion Report can, however, be revealed. There will
be four sections dealing with different aspects of regional policy. The
first will be an overview of social and economic cohesion within the EU,
showing past trends and developments. Then there will be a section dealing
with the individual efforts by the EU Member States to influence cohesion
within their territories. The third part will be an examination of the
EU's various complementary polices which have had an effect on the
regions, like the Common Agricultural Policy, telecommunications, business
networks and social policy. And the final part will concern the effects of
the EU's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund on the regions.

The impact of the report will be felt far beyond the Commission's regional
policies. The Commission is able to concede that the Cohesion Report will
provide a springboard to the 1999 review of the Structural Funds. And any
analysis of the link between the EU's efforts and social and economic
cohesion will be studied closely by the aspiring EU candidates in Central
and Eastern Europe (CEECs) hoping to gauge future EU regional policy.

The current Structural Funds have a total budget of ECU 157 billion for
the 1994 to 1999 period, and Mrs Wulf-Mathies has suggested maintaining
the overall criteria for the package. This will mean the Structural Fund
budget would remain at the current 0.46% of the EU's gross domestic
product, and the overall figure for the 2000 to 2006 period would be about
ECU 260 billion. But there is scepticism about keeping other aspects of
the current Structural Funds. For example, the Cohesion Fund, which
provides Funds for Member States with less than 90% of the EU's average
gross national product could be dominated by the CEECs if they join. The
same goes for the current criteria for Objective 1 of the Structural
Funds, which goes to the EU's poorest regions, whose gross domestic
product is 75% or less that the EU average.

AGRICULTURE: 1995 EU FARM SPENDING DOWN AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Total expenditure under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for 1995 rose to ECU 34,503 million,
from the ECU 32,970 million disbursed in 1994. However, this figure
represents a lower percentage of both the total EU Budget (51.7%, compared
with 55% in 1994) and total Community Gross Domestic Product (0.53%, down
from 0.58% in 1994). These facts emerge from the 25th EAGGF Guarantee
Section report*, newly approved by the European Commission. The report's
authors point out that the 1995 expenditure figures are inflated by the
inclusion for the first time of the three new Member States -Austria,
Finland and Sweden - and by the fact that direct aid to farmers introduced
under the 1992 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was also
stepped up during the year.

Expenditure well inside guideline.

The final total of appropriations allocated to the EAGGF Guarantee Section
in 1995, i.e. the original 1995 Budget, the Supplementary and Amending
Budget (SAB), letter of amendment, transfers and provisional
appropriations, totalled ECU 36,849.6 million (not including the monetary
reserve of ECU 500 million) plus automatic carry-overs amounting to ECU
64.3 million. During the 1995 financial year, the agricultural guideline,
which sets a ceiling on Guarantee Section spending, was fixed at ECU
37,944 million, somewhat higher than the 1994 financial year (ECU 36,465).
In the event, total expenditure came to ECU just 34,503 million. No
non-automatic carry-overs were made from the 1994 Budget to that of 1995
and there was therefore no expenditure under that heading. The trend in
expenditure since 1988 is shown below in Graph 1a. Graph 1b shows EAGGF
Guarantee Section expenditure within the EU's General Budget.

Expenditure breakdown.

Looking at the different categories of spending, the figures show that
spending on export refunds continued to decline, falling from ECU 8,161
million in 1994 to ECU 7,802 million in 1995. It thus now accounts for
only 22.6% of total EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure. Meanwhile,
intervention spending in 1995 came to ECU 26,206 million, mainly
consisting of storage aid and price compensatory aid (production,
processing and marketing aid). As a result of a return to more balanced
markets, expenditure on storage fell very steeply from ECU 5,386 million
in 1993 to ECU 1,070 million in 1994, and then again to ECU 339 million in
1995. On the other hand, price compensatory aid was up (from ECU 24,490
million in 1995 as compared with ECU 21,339 million in 1994). This was due
to the major expansion of production aid schemes (acreage payments,
set-aside, suckler-cow premiums and premiums for male bovine animals)
introduced as part of the 1992 reform of the CAP.

Arable aid dominant.

Comparing product sectors, arable crops, a heading which now subsumes four
former expenditure headings (cereals, oilseeds, protein plants and
set-aside), accounted for 43.5% of overall spending. This sector was
followed by milk products (11.7% ) and beef and veal (11.7%). (See Graph
2a below.)

France the chief beneficiary.

Among the Member States, France is still the main recipient of Guarantee
Section expenditure at ECU 8,377 million - absorbing some 24% of overall
spending. Next, at some distance, come Germany (ECU 5,380 million), Spain
(ECU 4,562 million) and Italy (ECU 3,364 million) (see Graph 2b). In their
first year following accession, Austria received ECU 86 million, Finland
ECU 62 million and Sweden ECU 75 million.

Lengthy clearance of accounts process.

One of the main features of the clearance of accounts procedure, the
report explains, is that it enables the Commission to recover from the
Member States sums unduly paid in the application of the regulations on
the Common Agricultural Policy. After lengthy dialogue and conciliation
stages with the Member States in question, decisions leading to recovery
are taken by the Commission. Following this path, clearance of the
accounts for 1991 was only adopted by the Commission on 21 December 1994,
so that its consequences apply in the 1995 financial year. The sum
recovered amounted to ECU 1,518.3 million out of expenditure totalling ECU
30,332 million, the report details.

Conciliation body begins work.

During 1995, under the accounts clearance procedure for 1992, a proposal
was put to the Commission for the recovery of ECU 1,026.5 million out of a
total of ECU 32,083 million. The Commission's final decision in February
1996 reduced the amount to be recovered to ECU 997.5 million. 1995 was
also the year in which the conciliation body began its work, which
involves observations on the clearance of the 1992 accounts. This led to a
series of new, lengthy preventive measures on the part of the Commission
EAGGF accounts clearance departments following upon the conciliation
procedure. At the same time, preparation of the accounts clearance
procedure relating to the 1993 financial year continued to the stage of
dialogue with the Member States, says the EAGGF report.

ENVIRONMENT: "NEW" PROPOSALS FOR ENFORCING LEGISLATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 22, the European Commission presented a three-point programme
for improving implementation of EU environmental legislation. This is not
a superfluous initiative: in 1995, the Commission registered 265 suspected
breaches of environmental Directives, representing no less than 20% of all
infringements against Community law. This is why, according to the
Commission, "original proposals" must be now considered. However, it
remains to be seen whether this "Communication on the implementation of EU
environmental law" - which only sets out general guidelines - will have
any genuine effect as it does not contain any binding measures. It will at
least have the merit of launching a wide-ranging debate on the issue.

As Ritt Bjerregaard, the Environment Commissioner, recalled, "improving
implementation of EU environmental law is not just a question of taking
Member States to Court". "It is neither possible nor practical for all the
legal actions that could arise from lack of compliance with Community
rules to be channelled through one enforcing authority, the Commission and
one court of law, the Court of Justice", the Commission explains. Recourse
to Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty appears insufficient but will remain
complementary to any new measures envisaged.

According to the Communication, the following three initiatives are most
apt to effectively improve the implementation of EU environmental
legislation "because control of implementation begins at home, in the
Member States":

* the establishment of guidelines to assist the Member States in their
environmental inspections;

* the establishment of a procedure within the Member States to receive and
examine complaints from the public about the implementation of Community
environmental law;

* examination by the Commission of the question of guaranteed basic access
for representative organisations to the national jurisdictions, "in
keeping with the principle of subsidiarity" (some Member States already
have an Ombudsman system, while others have no provision). This is the
most controversial issue. Following the adoption of the Communication, one
Commission official explained "we have no wish to create new mechanisms
where provisions already exist".

"The solutions we are advocating would enable non-governmental
organisations to appeal to the courts", he explained, imparting the
Commission's wish for decisions to be taken at the most local level
possible.

On the Community level the Commission may, in future proposals (and when
revision existing Directives), introduce a specific provision requiring
the Member States to provide sanctions in national legislation for failure
to respect EU environmental law. These penal, administrative and other
sanctions may for example take the form of withdrawing operating licences
from such factories as fail to respect a Directive.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT VOTES ON SAFETY OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND SHIPS.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered in plenary session in Strasbourg between October 21 and 25, MEPs
adopted two reports concerning transport. The approved report concerning
the Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their
trailers (cooperation procedure second reading) only retains three of the
amendments proposed by the rapporteur Italian Independent Spalato Bellere.
MEPs are anxious to increase the frequency of testing (three years after
the date on which the vehicle was first used and thereafter every year)
and ban old vehicles that fail to meet minimum standards for braking
systems and emissions. Voting to adopt the report by Nikitas Kaklamanis
(UFE, Greece) on the safety and efficiency of marine equipment aboard
ships sailing between European Union ports, MEPs retained a number of the
amendments tabled in first reading (under the cooperation procedure),
notably the insistence that safety checks are carried out by accredited
independent bodies.

SWEDEN REFUSES TO BUDGE ON TRAVELLERS' ALCOHOL ALLOWANCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Sweden remains intractable in current negotiations with the European
Commission on purchases of alcohol by travellers. To the Commission's
dismay, Sweden is still refusing to set a date for the end of a derogation
allowing it, along with Denmark and Finland, to impose stricter limits on
purchases of alcoholic beverages by citizens travelling within the
European Union than those provided for in Community legislation. Mario
Monti, the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Customs and
Taxation, held another round of talks with the Finance Ministers of the
three Nordic countries in Strasbourg on October 23. He said that he
remained flexible as to the date when the exemption would end, but that he
wanted this date, once specified, to be firm (see European Report N  s
2167). If no agreement can be reached, the European Court of Justice will
be responsible for putting an end to the derogation, the Commission warned
following the meeting.

Denmark and Finland are reportedly willing to give up their special regime
in 2004. The Commissioner feels, however, that five and half years is
sufficient time for these countries to adjust. He said following the
meeting that he would suggest that the Commission set a deadline of June
30, 2002. The Commission will present a proposal to this effect very
shortly, so that the Finance Ministers will have time to examine it before
the end of the year. Unanimous agreement is required to extend these
exemptions beyond 1999, the date initially specified by the Commission.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

INTERNAL MARKET COUNCIL: ALL TALK AND SCARCELY ANY ACTION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Gathered on October 25 in Luxembourg for a sitting devoted to the Internal
Market, EU Ministers listened to strong words from European Commissioner
Mario Monti, who sought to prod them into applying EU Single Market
legislation more effectively. The Ministers held a debate on transparency
of rules covering information society services. Talks about administrative
cooperation, in particular, were held with representatives of associate
countries from Central and Eastern Europe (see separate article). As
European Report was going to press, the Council was on the verge of
passing a Resolution on streamlining customs procedures and giving the
European Commission permission to negotiate a Customs Cooperation
Agreement with Norway.

Toeing the line.

Unless EU countries show a bit more determination in trying to apply
mutually-agreed rules, the Single Market will not be able to produce the
anticipated benefits in terms of jobs, economic growth and
competitiveness. This is the gist of the message that the Commissioner for
the Internal Market had to give to Ministers. In spite of the appeal made
at the EU Summit in Florence last June and the letter Mr Monti sent to
each Member State, there is little improvement to report in the way the
Member States are transposing and applying Internal Market Directives: the
overall rate of transposition for all Member States is virtually the same
as that reported at the previous Internal Market Council in May (93.3% in
the case of Directives reflecting the 219 measures the 1985 White Paper
thought necessary for completing the Single Market, and 90.9% for the
1,140 Directives relating to the Internal Market).

In the context of Single Market legislation as a whole, the Commission has
instituted 11 proceedings against Member States in the EU Court of
Justice. Denmark and the Netherlands are the two most disciplined
countries in this respect and far outstrip the larger countries. Spain and
France come eighth and ninth respectively in the class, whereas, Germany
is last but one, the one being Austria. The most problematic sectors
continue to be public procurement (Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands
are alone in successfully transposing EU legislation in this area) and
insurance (Spain and Greece are lagging well behind). The Commissioner
reported the presentation, in early November, of a Commission
Communication on the impact and efficiency of the Single Market in the
European Union.

Mr Monti explained to Ministers the key ideas in the Citizens First
initiative due to be launched on November 26 (and not November 20 as we
mistakenly reported in our previous issue). The first information guides
for the general public in Europe will focus on the themes of living,
working, studying, training and carrying out research in an other EU
country. Others due to be published in mid 1997 will cover consumers and
the social dimension of the Single Market. A free phone service will be
set up in each country to enable individuals to gain access to the media
for this large-scale information campaign The Commission also referred to
the progress made with pilot projects initiated under the SLIM programme
on legislative legislation. This matter is due to be given a higher
profile during the November 26 Internal Market Council.

Openness in the information society.

During the debate on the Commission's proposal for a Communication on
regulatory transparency in the Internal Market for information society
services, France was the only country to bristle at the strategy being
recommended. Paris argued that the some of the services were treated in
the proposal "like pieces of merchandise". The French representative was
referring to the Commission's idea of treating on-line services,
interactive entertainment services and on-line information services as
coming within the scope of EU legislation on the free movement of goods
and not on telecommunications or the audiovisual sector. (European Report
will return to this matter in a forthcoming issue.)

Other subjects.

As the afternoon was drawing to a close, on October 25, Ministers were
still preparing to adopt a Resolution on the simplification and
rationalisation of customs rules and procedures. Ministers had already
reached an agreement on this matter prior to the Council meeting. They
were also due to give permission to the Commission to negotiate a customs
cooperation agreement with Norway, an agreement that would take account of
links this country has in this sphere with the Nordic EU countries. They
were also set to adopt without further debate a Regulation for increasing
from 30 to 100% the guarantee given by transport hauliers for
non-sensitive goods (less exposed to fraud) under the Community transit
system. This decision gave rise to an agreement on October 23 between
COREPER (the Committee of Member States' Permanent Representatives to the
EU) and the European Commission (see previous issue of European Report).
The agreement nonetheless allows certain exemptions and maintains the
guarantee at 30% for transporters above suspicion (established in the
Member States where the guarantee is given, frequent users who have always
behaved correctly, etc.).

EU Agriculture Ministers meeting in Council in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 will return to a subject which has dominated the headlines in one

falling demand in the wake of the BSE crisis. With a number of Member
States unwilling to back some of the more far-reaching elements in the
European Commission proposals for cutting production volumes, the
Ministers are unlikely to reach consensus without burning the customary
midnight oil. However, the financing question may prove to be the biggest
stumbling block. The European Parliament has so far refused to consider
proposals for slashing cereals aid to pay for beef support, which means
the Council cannot legally adopt them. Meanwhile, the Commission is
insisting it cannot endorse the necessary ECU 1 billion-plus of
expenditure without first balancing the books.

Commission wants balanced budget.

A package of three linked proposals tabled by Farm Commissioner Franz
Fischler on July 30 calls for reductions in arable aid payments and cuts
in investment support to pay for higher beef intervention buying and other
short-term measures designed to absorb surplus EU beef production,
estimated at 1.2 million tonnes per year since consumption has fallen in
the wake of the "mad cow" crisis. Parliament used its urgency procedure to
vote an Opinion on the first part of the package - the purely beef sector
measures - on September 20, but refused to do the same for the
controversial arable aid cuts. The Commissioner has always expressed
reluctance to see the three elements split up. If measures costing over
ECU1 billion are to be agreed, then the Ministers should decide at the
same time where the money is coming from, insisted a Fischler aide.
However, a Commission spokesman insisted on October 25 that basic
agreement on the medium-term measures - designed to cut back production by
slaughtering very young calves, reducing premium rights for farmers and
lowering stocking density - would have to be reached before Ministers head
for the airport on October 29 or 30.

In fact, Franz Fischler has already given away an important bargaining
chip in agreeing to raise the Community beef intervention ceiling from
400,000 to 460,000 tonnes for 1996, and endorse public buying-in of
lighter cattle ("weanlings") under 300 kilogrammes in weight. These
decisions, voted through on a Commission proposal by Ministers at the
Fisheries Council on October 14, have taken some of the urgency out of the
issue, and the Member States' delegations may now be more inclined to hold
out for better terms for their farmers in the overall package. The more
intensive farming countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium
are opposed to moves to lower the regional stocking ceilings used for
calculating eligibility for special beef premium payments to farmers and
reduce the stocking levels for eligibility to the "extensification
premium". The Netherlands and Italy are unwilling to introduce the
new-born calf slaughter option, which they feel will outrage public
opinion, France wants to see premiums payable on suckler cows raised,
while Portugal is fighting to maintain the second premium payable on its
older, extensively-raised, bulls. (see European Report N   2158 for full
details of Member States' positions).

Problem now less urgent?

Meanwhile a report on the beef crisis drafted by experts in the
Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture (DGVI), which was due to
be discussed at the Council, has been held up in the pipeline by Edith
Cresson, one of France's two Commissioners. The conclusions of the report
basically state that no further compensation should be paid to EU beef
farmers for losses incurred this year. Total producer losses since the
beef crisis began are put at just over ECU 1.1 billion for 1996. Council
has already allocated a package of Community money worth ECU 850 million,
with provisions for the Member States to match that figure with equal
national funds. Meanwhile some ECU 230 million has been brought forward
from the 1997 Budget allocation to pay advance suckler cow premia during
1996. This will have the effect of freeing up an equal amount of Community
funds to help finance beef measures next year. The French authorities are
still pushing however for extra compensation for their beef producers.

Exports booming.

On October 25 the EU Beef and Veal Management Committee accepted a further
31,000 tonnes of prime beef, plus 180 tonnes of weanlings, into
intervention, bringing to 396,000 tonnes the total amount of beef carcases
now in public storage. The Commission spokesman stressed that 1996
intervention would not now approach the 720,000 tonnes foreseen in early
pessimistic scenarios at the height of the crisis. Exports from the Union
are now running well over 22,000 tonnes per week and some 100,000 tonnes
ahead of schedule for the year 1996/97, as foreign demand has picked up
again. However, the GATT Agreement on Agriculture limit on export of
subsidised EU beef is likely to be reached before June 1997, when the
problem will flare up again, he warned.

Identification and labelling.

The Council will also register its initial reaction to Commission
proposals for cattle identification and beef labelling rules. The idea is
that all EU cattle should be identified by means of an eartag and personal
passport. As regards labelling, individual producers and organisations
would be authorised to put in place voluntary schemes for providing the
customer with detailed information on their beef products. The draft
Regulation lays down what information may appear on a label (for details
see European Report N   2163), and lays down rules for verifying the truth
of any claims made. The Commission hopes this scheme will be up and
running by January 1997, but the European Parliament will need to register
its Opinion before the Council can go ahead and adopt the legislation.

Quickfire offals proposal?

Franz Fischler has also announced he will be tabling proposals banning all
designated "sensitive tissues" from cattle and sheep from the human-animal
food chain (see separate article on mad cow disease).

Inspection Office.

Under the final main point on the Council agenda, the Ministers will look
at the long-standing proposal to set up an EU Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Inspection Office in Ireland. The proposals call for an independent agency
to take over part of the tasks currently being carried out by the Office
of Veterinary and Phytosanitary Inspection and Control (OVPIC) under the
auspices of the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture. The
Council has been asked to approve changes to the legal structure of this
new body in order to ensure its effectiveness and speed of action. An
advance staff has already set up shop in the town of Grange in County
Meath as the site of the new Agency, but disagreements are still raging
over the status of the office, the powers to be accorded to its staff,
numbers of new veterinary personnel to be hired, and the financing for the
expanded operation. Germany believes the Agency should remain a small
operation, financed entirely from the Community Budget, rather than
obtaining its own finances from licence fees on products authorised.

Other business.

A number of Member States have tabled points they wish to discuss under
any other business:

- Austria is concerned about subsidised cattle exports from Switzerland,
which are making life hard for Austrian exporters of calves to Italy;

- the Spanish and Portuguese delegations are demanding that the Commission
draft a "reflexion paper" for wide discussion before finalising its
upcoming proposals for reform of the olive oil sector;

- France and Greece want to see the provisions for grubbing-up of apple,
pear and nectarine orchards agreed under the 1996/97 price package
implemented promptly;

- the UK and the Netherlands want to keep up the pressure for
thoroughgoing implementation of Directive 95/29/EC, safeguarding the
welfare of animals in transit, particularly as regards mandatory staging
posts and vehicle capacity;

- the Greeks want to discuss the issue of foot-and-mouth disease in Turkey;

- Portugal intends to bring to the fore the plight of farming and forestry
in arid regions;

- the Swedish delegation wants to discuss the upcoming World Food Summit,
scheduled for November 13-17, urging that further CAP reforms would
facilitate cheaper worldwide provision of food.

AMERICAN SURVEY ON FACTORS AFFECTING EUROPEAN BUSINESS FORTUNES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands are the European countries rated
as most favourable for business, according to a survey conducted by the
European Council of Chambers of Commerce (ECACC*). The ECACC members were
invited to assess factors likely to affect the development of business in
23 European countries and the Mediterranean basin. The factors include
government policies, infrastructure, employment and social security
legislation, tax systems, and the quality of life. Countries with the most
unfavourable "climates" in this respect are Greece, Bulgaria, Poland, the
Slovak Republic and Romania. ECACC members were also questioned about the
medium-term (the next five years) prospects: the UK, Belgium, Switzerland,
Italy and Germany are fairly pessimistic, believing that the economic
climate is set to get worse.

Economic factors, including government incentives, banking systems, tax
levels and rates, social security costs, employee healthcare costs,
foreign exchange rate stability and environmental policy, were most
favourable in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands and
Austria, while they were rated as unfavourable in Poland, Hungary,
Belgium, Romania and France. As for workforce-related issues, including
worker quality, labour costs, training and retraining, labour unions and
worker involvement, Ireland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Norway and Turkey were
rated highest in terms of the most favourable business environment, and
Belgium, France, Germany, Romania and Portugal came in lowest.

* Set up in 1963, ECACC represents American Chambers of Commerce in 21
countries, from Sweden to Israel and from Russia to Portugal. Some 16,000
companies (American and European) are affiliated to these Chambers of
Commerce.

MEMORANDUM TO CLEANING INDUSTRY

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Trade union and employers' representatives from the European cleaning
industry, the FENI representing employers and Euro-Fiet the trade unions,
signed a joint memorandum on new sources of employment on October 21. This
agreement is the first concerning the development of new jobs signed by
social partners within the framework of a sectorial dialogue. The European
Commissioner for Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn, described the agreement as
"an innovative and realistic action marking an important step in the
shared work of the social partners". The memorandum asks public
authorities to create the conditions necessary for the exploitation of
these new sources of jobs, the cost of which is often too high for
individuals. The social partners have suggested that the Member States
introduce subsidies to develop demand on the part of individuals and
discourage work "off the books". Other mechanisms could include the
introduction of tax incentives and a reduction of the VAT rate on cleaning
services. The FENI and Euro-Fiet plan to hold a European colloquium on
this theme in early 1997, followed by Round Tables of all of the concerned
actors in the Member States.

UNICE OPPOSES ROAD USER CHARGE POLICY.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European employers represented by UNICE do not want to see road user
charges rise for another five years, to allow time for a global assessment
of the impact of such measures. It comes as no surprise that the proposals
on goods haulage by road presented by the Union of Industrial and
Employers' Confederations of Europe in Brussels on October 22 diverged
widely from the strategy pursued by the European Commission over the past
few months. Concerned about European industry's ability to compete on the
North American and Japanese markets, UNICE claimed that other modes of
transport are not competitive enough to handle the additional freight that
would be shifted off the roads to rail, inland waterways or maritime
cabotage. "European companies, on average, pay 16% more than those in the
United States and 21% more than in Japan for transport and logistics
services", says UNICE to justify its opposition to any increase in road
taxes. The message is clear: road transport is the only mode that works
efficiently, and imposing higher taxes on it will make it more difficult
for European firms to compete and could lead to company transfers and job
losses.

EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert denied reports on BBC Radio
Five Live on October 24 that a formal investigation was under way into
alleged distortion of EU competition rules by British Satellite channel,
BskyB, over its football Premiership deal. An EU source said that the
British Broadcasting Corporation had been mistaken in its confusion
between what Mr Van Miert said was a need to closely watch all exclusive
television agreements, and a formal investigation such as the one
currently being made into seven-year fixed contracts for a Dutch sports
channel (see European Report N   2157).

FRANCO-GERMAN STEEL TAKEOVER CLEARED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A takeover by German stockholding and steel distribution company Klockner
Stahl and Metallhandel (KSM) of French Arus Distribution Industrielle,
which is active in the same field, was cleared by the European Commission
on October 24. KSM is indirectly wholly-owned by the German industrial
giant, VIAG. Arus was founded in December 1993 when Paris-based Arbed and
Usinor Sacilor of Luxembourg, merged their steel business. It distributes
steel products in France and Britain for industry, ironmongery,
non-ferrous metals, heating and sanitary equipment. Under the takeover
agreement, KSM will acquire 62% of the shares in Arus, 31% from each of
Arbed and Usinor. Although the remaining shares are widely dispersed, KSM
will, as a result of the deal, hold sole control over Arus.

A Commission investigation into the agreement showed that it would not
give rise to market shares above 10% in either Germany, France or Britain.
In all sectors of the steel market, the combined Arus/KSM company was also
found to be likely to face strong competition from PUM, the Cockerill
Sambre subsidiary and the largest steel stockbroker in France, as well as
a large number of other stockholders, including at least two with market
shares of over 10% for heavy sections and merchant bars.

PUBLIC AID SCHEME FOR LUXEMBOURG'S COUNTRYSIDE APPROVED.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

An aid scheme under Luxembourg's "programme for the upkeep of the
countryside and the landscape" was approved by the European Commission on
October 23. It constitutes a series of measures, financed on the one hand
by national aid, and on the other by funds from the EU's agri-environment
programme, to vineyards on steep slopes (with an inclination amounting to
more than 30%) and terraced vineyards. The total aid comes to
approximately 47,000 Luxembourg Francs and works out at about ECU 1,208
per hectare. The Commission has also said it will allow the Luxembourg
authorities to use state subsidies to finance less-intensive farming
methods which are compatible with environmental protection and the
maintenance of the countryside, before the Community part-funding arrives.

German construction and civil engineering firm Schachtbau Nordhausen was
given European Commission approval on October 23 to receive state aid for
a restructuring plan which began soon after it was privatised in 1992. The
aid involves a waiving of claims on the firm totalling 3.8 million
Deutschemarks, and a four-year extension on the repayment period of a 4
million DM state loan. In authorising the aid, the Commission took account
of its role in the overhaul of "an ailing firm in an area facing
considerable economic difficulty". The unemployment rate in Nordhausen was
running at 21% at the beginning of the year.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: COMMISSIONER URGES DEREGULATION IN SPAIN BY JANUARY
1998

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Karel Van Miert, European Commissioner for Competition, sent a letter on
October 24 to the Spanish authorities, asking them formally to forgo a
five-year waiver allowed by EU legislation. Spain would therefore
undertake to completely liberalise its telecommunications industry
(services and infrastructure) by January 1, 1998. An EU-wide telecoms
deregulation agreement, which hinges on the Spanish decision, would help
give a fillip to the stalled World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks on the
worldwide deregulation of telecommunications services, stresses the
European Commission.

Exemptions.

Spain has already made clear its intention not to use the five-year
transitional period in full, but it is still seeking a 22-month stay of
grace. This would mean that not before October 1999, the date when the new
legislation on licences would be introduced, would Madrid be required to
grant permits to other vocal telephony operators. Commissioner Van Miert
is apparently ready to grant Spain extra time to introduce the licensing
legislation, but no longer than six months. This would mean that no later
than June 30, 1998, the Spanish telecoms market would be opened up to
competition. Spain is the only Member State not to formally seek a delay
for opening up the sector to competition. Ireland, Portugal, Luxembourg
and Greece also enjoy this possibility and have made requests along these
lines (see table below).

The Commission stresses that Telefonica, the operator with monopoly
control over the basic vocal telephony service in Spain, is prepared to
accept liberalisation by January 1, 1998. Community sources also indicate
that the go-ahead for the merger between Telefonica and Unisource will be
not be given until Spain has officially confirmed the timetable being
sought. Unisource is jointly owned by operators from Sweden (Telia AB),
the Netherlands (PTT Telecom) and Switzerland (Sweizerische PTT-Betriebe).

Karel Van Miert cites several reasons for minimising the periods of time
covered by the exemptions. Under the terms of EU Directives regulating the
liberalisation process, transitional periods of this kind may be granted
only in the light of the sophistication of the networks. Further, the
Council of Ministers and the European Council have often stressed the
importance of a swift liberalisation process, in the interests of economic
growth and the promotion of the information society. It is also important
for the countries involved to become integrated as soon as possible into
the European telecoms market and thus be in a position to benefit from
investment and corresponding services.

WTO talks.

The Commission believes the EU-wide telecoms deregulation process will
also make a major impact on the WTO talks on telecommunications. The EU
deadline has to be as close as possible to 1998 in the Member States, as
1998 is also the target date set for liberalisation worldwide.

The WTO talks are due to end on February 15, 1997. The 53 countries taking
part in the talks should have reached an agreement last April 30, but at
the eleventh hour, the US decided to harden its position and thus
undermined the deal. The parties therefore gave themselves another nine
and a half months. The next key stage will unfold from December 9 to 13 in
Singapore, during the WTO Ministerial-level conference. In the meantime, a
high-level meeting is scheduled for November 14, after the US Presidential
elections.

Sir Leon Brittan, European Commissioner with the External Trade portfolio,
is hoping to use the intervening period to put the final touches to
Europe's improved offer to Geneva, with a firm commitment from Spain: this
country assumes particular importance in the WTO talks, given the size of
its domestic market and the inroads made by Telefonica in several Latin
American countries. Spain is the only country to be expressing reluctance,
according to a sources closely involved with the matter. Belgium, France,
Greece and Portugal also seemed disinclined, last March, to open up their
markets, but their doubts have now been dispelled, apparently.

Reaction from Madrid.

In a communique published on October 24, the Spanish Government confirmed
its resolve to open up Spain's telecoms sector in 1999. Rafael Arias
Sagado, Spanish Ministers for Public Works, issued a timetable, on October
9, for the programme of activities needed to ensure the telecoms markets
is fully exposed to competition. The timetable provides for the general
Law on communications to be completed in December 1997 and for the
Regulation on services and licensing procedures12 months later. The
Regulation governing the conditions for occupying the public sector is to
be adopted in the first quarter of 1999. Concrete licensing decisions are
due to be taken during the second quarter of 1999, according to the
Minister.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility Electrabel, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

ENPA APPLAUDS GREEN PAPER ON COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Newspaper publishers represented by the European Newspaper Publishers
Association (ENPA) have cheered the approach recommended by the European
Commission in the Green Paper it published last May on commercial
communication (COM 96/192). The paper offers several guidelines for
harmonising the framework of rules on these sorts of communication (that
is advertising in all its forms) or at least for smoothing out the
national difference to some extent. The ENPA is particularly pleased about
the idea of a case-by-case probe of initiatives that European and national
authorities would be called upon to take in this realm. Subjecting the
initiatives to public scrutiny should prevent the emergence of new
obstacles, particularly in the context of the information society. ENPA
thinks that initially the country of origin rule should be strengthened
throughout the Single Market. This may be achieved by mutual recognition
of national rules. The publishers are backing the Commission's aspirations
to streamline the European legal setting. They call on the EU authorities
to take full account of the cultural diversities in the EU. The ENPA also
wants to see the Committee due to be instructed to monitor the rules
governing approximation process extended to publishers.

The ENPA is a lot more scathing about the Commission media concentration
plan. Confected by the services of Mario Monti, European Commissioner for
the Internal Market, the project is still under negotiation at the
Commission. The aim is to set a number of restrictions on media
concentrations so as to safeguard pluralism. The way the ENPA sees it, the
plan in its present form would act as a major obstacle to the future
development of local or regional publishing houses. The criteria adopted
would discourage the companies from growing as a de facto readership
threshold of 30% is imposed on any newspaper hoping to get involved in
broadcasting, according to the ENPA. Moreover, the rules being
contemplated would affect only time-honoured activities (daily newspapers,
radio and TV) and would affect the ability to develop new products and
services in the media industry.

INTERNAL AUDITORS STAKE A CLAIM IN AUDIT GREEN PAPER DEBATE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing (ECIIA) has
welcomed the European Commission's July 24 Green Paper on the Role,
Position and Liability of Statutory Auditors (see European Report N  
2152), but says the Commission's insistence on effective systems of
internal control as a key element of corporate governance is only a start.
"Establishing, running and maintaining an effective system of internal
control calls for skills which most managers do not possess, and which can
only be provided through a competent and professionally qualified internal
audit function", says the internal auditing profession's European body. It
goes on to call for internal audit to be made mandatory in large
organisations.

ECIIA says an "expectation gap" has opened up between what the public
expects and what current rules provide on corporate governance. But
"exclusive reliance on the statutory auditor" cannot ensure adequate
internal control, and only creates "unfulfillable expectations in the
public mind". Certification of financial statements is not enough, it
argues: a "snapshot" judgement as to whether a company has a chance of
still being able to trade twelve months ahead "is hardly up to the task of
responding fully to shareholder and creditor concerns", it says, insisting
on the need for more systematic measurement - via an internal audit
function - of more reliable business performance indicators. Similarly,
the best way of dealing with fraud is by prevention rather than detection,
ECIIA argues - again pointing to the role of internal audit.

Above all, ECIIA says - contrary to the Commission's view - that boards of
directors are not in a position to respond to public concern over the need
for effective control. This is largely a day-to-day matter more properly
in the realm of management, the internal auditors claim. And any control
system put in place without an adequate review system "will probably fail
at critical points", warns ECIIA.

STATE AID: COMMISSION REJECTS TAX BREAK SCHEME FOR ITALIAN ROAD HAULIERS

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Tax credits worth ECU 466 million for Italian road hauliers in 1993 and
1994 were rejected by the European Commission on October 23 as
incompatible with EU state aid rules. The scheme operated on the basis of
payments of a fixed percentage, up to a certain maximum, of the cost
(minus VAT) of fuel and lubricants, calculated according to the weight of
the vehicle, to travel within Italy.

Under the scheme, Italian legislation provided for a system of tax credits
for Italian road hauliers operating for other people (i.e. not on their
own account), and for a system of compensation for non-Italian EU hauliers
(who are compensated for the fuel they use in travelling on Italian
territory). In 1992, the Commission started formal state aid proceedings
against the Italian State regarding a similar credit scheme in operation
that year, and found the aid to be incompatible with the Treaty. Two years
later, the Commission took Italy to the European Court of Justice for
failing to observe its Decision.

But the Italians continued with their tax incentives for road hauliers.
The credit schemes proposed for 1993 and 1994 are in all but terms of
budget, ceilings and application periods the same as those already
outlawed by the Commission; the only new element is the compensation for
non-Italian EU hauliers. A formal state aid investigation into the
1993/1994 scheme under Article 93(2) of the Treaty was opened in October
1995.

The Commission inquiry has found the scheme incompatible with the Treaty
on the grounds that it is an operating aid that is not offered as part of
a restructuring plan for the sector. It does not, therefore, fill any of
the conditions for exemptions to the Treaty's state aid rules. All aid
already paid out has been ordered to be recovered by the Italian
authorities.

COMMISSION RE-OPENS SECURIPOST STATE AID CASE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission investigation into allegedly illegal state aid to
French transport and security company, Securipost, prior to its
privatisation in 1993, was re-opened on October 23. The decision was made
following a September1995 ruling by the European Court of Justice that the
Commission had not taken sufficient account of a complaints by the Chambre
syndicale nationale des entreprises de fonds et de valeurs (French union
for investment funds, stock brokers and other financial service firms),
known as Sytravel, and the company, Brink's France.

The French Government will be asked to provide information in particular
on compensation payments to civil servants made redundant as a result of
the privatisation plan, and an apparent failure by Securipost to pay
social security contributions towards state unemployment benefit funds.
There are also suspicions that the French authorities may have made a
direct capital investment of FF15 million to Securipost in 1989. At the
specific request of the Court of Justice, the Commission has said it will
also carry out further investigations into fees charged by Securipost for
its services to the French national post office. Paris has one month to
reply to the allegations

FRENCH R&D SUBSIDIES FOR STEEL INDUSTRY APPROVED

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

French Government subsidies for two steel industry research and
development projects were approved by the European Commission on October
23. The first, a project dubbed "Myosotis", is being carried out at
Isbergues, in the Pas-de-Calais region, in collaboration with the German
group Thyssen, through a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), and
relates to a continuous thin-strip casting process. It is expected to cost
a total of FF 96 million and cover a three-year period (1995-97). Under a
scheme known as "Major Innovative Projects" the project will be 50%
financed by the French steel company Uscinor Sacilor, which will receive
FF 12 million from the French State.

The other project, covering an equivalent period, to be carried out at the
Maizi
res and Gondrange works by IRSID, a Usinor Sacilor subsidiary, is
designed to adapt steel-making processes for use with scrap, and in
particular to adapt electric furnaces to new sources of iron. To be known
as the "steelworks of the future", it is intended to make optimum use of
energy and find solutions to the environmental hazards caused by the large
amounts of scrap metal in France and other Member States. The project,
which will cost a total of FF 76.5 million, is at the applied research
stage and will receive aid of FF 17.5 million.

STATE AID: GREEN LIGHT FOR TWO OUT OF THREE SPANISH OPEL PLANT SUBSIDIES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Two 1994 state subsidies granted by the Spanish region of Aragon to Opel's
Saragossa plant were given European Commission retroactive approval on
October 23. The Commission said the aid, which was intended to help
towards the production of the new Tigra sports model, was compatible with
rules for state aid to the motor industry. A third aid injection to the
General Motors-owned German car maker, from the same year, but for a
different sector of the plant, was turned down by the Commission, and
ordered to be repaid.

The permitted aid consisted firstly of a grant of 100 million Pesetas
towards an overall investment of 1,326 million for the introduction of
new, more sophisticated technology at the plant, and secondly, of a grant
of 68 million Pesetas towards total costs of 340 million Pesetas to train
the 500 employees to use the new technology. The third aid injection, a
grant of 200 million Pesetas towards the development of new software
equipment at a total cost of 1,300 million Pesetas, was rejected on the
grounds that it did not comply with EU criteria for state aid to the motor
industry. In a statement, the Commission said it has since received
assurances from the Spanish authorities that the 161 million Pesetas
already granted to the firm would be recovered.

Opel Spain is wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors Spain. In 1993,
the Saragossa headquarters produced two Opel models, the Corsa and the
Astra, and had a turnover of 465 billion Pesetas, with net profits of 19
billion. Production of the Tigra model began in 1994 when the state aid
was granted.

VAN MIERT MEETS GERMAN SKET DELEGATION OVER NEW AID PLAN

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A new restructuring plan for German heavy machinery giant SKET is soon to
be submitted to the European Commission for approval, a meeting between a
delegation from the company and EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert revealed on October 23. A former flagship of East German industry,
SKET Schwermaschinenbau Magdeburg, based in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, went
into financial receivership in mid-October. A Commission spokesman said Mr
Van Miert was "concerned with the situation, and prepared to analyse a new
plan with the same understanding he has already shown to SKET".

The Commission opened a formal investigation in March 1995 over
approximately DM 957 million worth of state aid to the troubled company.
The procedure was extended in July 1996 when additional measures worth DM
352 million were announced after the original privatisation plan
floundered (see European Report N   2153). SKET's recent efforts to restore
profitability have amounted to a reduction in costs of DM 31 million, but
the Commission is still doubtful about its chances of long-term viability
- something which a new plan must ensure if it is to be approved. Brussels
also suspects that some of the aid may have been used to cover SKET's
operating costs or to sell products at dumping prices. SKET owns 120 small
supply companies, and is currently under the control of the Bundesanstalt
fur vereiningungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS) - the German public agency
for special tasks related to reunification. Although there is no official
deadline for the formal submission of the plan, German Government sources
have said they hope it will be drawn up by the end of the year.

COMPETITION: COURT REJECTS COMMISSION EUROTUNNEL CONTRACT DECISION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European Commission decision nearly two years ago to force French and
British railway companies, Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer (SNCF), and
British Rail (BR) to give 25% of the Channel Tunnel's capacity to third
party operators (case T-79/T-80/95) was rejected by the European Court of
First Instance on October 22, on the grounds that it was based on a
factual error. In a statement, the Court said it had found the Commission
to have made a "profound error of judgement" over the interpretation of
the usage contract governing access to the tunnel.

A fixed rail link beneath the English Channel between Frethen in
Nord-Pas-de-Calais, and Cheriton in Kent, was born of an agreement signed
on February 12, 1986 by the French and British Governments. On March14,
1996, two private companies, Channel Tunnel Group, and France Manche,
secured the concession to build and operate the Channel Tunnel,
establishing a joint-venture company under the name of 'Eurotunnel'. The
concession, which was originally for 55 years, but later extended to 65
years in 1994, provided for half the Channel Tunnel capacity to be
reserved for passenger and goods trains between Britain and continental
Europe. SNCF and BR were to be entitled to retain full use of their share
of the capacity, on the condition that they arranged for the maximum
number of trains possible, provided adequate national railway
infrastructure (including for high-speed trains), and maintained their
payments to Eurotunnel - including a share of upkeep and maintenance.

But, after receiving comments from the interested parties, the Commission
ruled on December 13, 1994 that the way the usage contract was structured
allowed BR and SNCF to hold 100% of hourly paths available for
international freight, and that it was an infringement of Article 85 of
the EU Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. It imposed a condition
on the two companies by which they would be required to make available 25%
of the hourly capacity of the tunnel to competitors. SNCF and BR contested
the Commission's Decision and lodged complaints at the Court of Justice on
March 7 and March 8, 1995 respectively. On October 22, they successfully
convinced the Court that third parties have always had access to the
Channel Tunnel, and that they had never had any intention to secure more
than 50% of international capacity. Since the Commission Decision has been
in place, no parties have actually come forward to exercise the right to
the remaining 25%, which is now no longer likely to be applicable,
following the Court's ruling. Meanwhile, loss-making Eurotunnel said on
October 22 that it would shed 657 jobs in an attempt to improve its
competitiveness.

EIB EURO-BOND ISSUE IN SPAIN.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Investment Bank is preparing the first Peseta-denominated
bond issue in Spain intended for small savers. "Bonos Europeos" will be
available in Spain from October 28 to November 15. Some 20 savings banks
and commercial banks, with more than 15,000 agencies in the country, will
offer for subscription 40 billion Pesetas worth of EIB bonds for a nominal
value of 10,000 Pesetas (ECU 62). The bonds are for 10 years and carry a
six-month interest rate of 7% (annual rate of 7.12%). The managing
underwriters are guaranteeing individual investors liquidity of the bonds
within 24 hours. The issue will be jointly managed by the Caja de Madrid,
Banco Central Hispano and Banco de Santander. The bond issue will
strengthen cooperation between the EIB and the Spanish banking sector and
allow the Bank scope for continuing to diversify its system for collecting
Peseta-denominated resources, according to the Bank. In Spain, the Bank
has helped along the development of the "Matador" market (bond market for
non-resident issuers of Peseta-denominated bonds) by its continuing
presence as a borrower of large amounts of funding. Between 1988 and 1995,
the EIB launched 38 issues and managed to collect over 750,000 million
Pesetas. Since the start of the year, it has raised over 200 billion.

MILD IMPROVEMENT IN CONFIDENCE INDICATOR IN JULY/AUGUST

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Confidence in the economic outlook improved slightly between July and
August, according to a European Commission survey conducted among company
managers and consumer and published on October 21. The figures show that
the period of zero growth is drawing to a close, even though economic
indicators are still below the long-term average.

Figures for August show that companies prepared to step up production in
the coming months outnumber those who expect to do the opposite.
Nonetheless, EU industry orderbooks are far from full and exports continue
to be too low. The level of durable stocks is also considered excessive in
terms of demand for industrial products. The outlook is less bleak in
terms of the predicted level of orders and growth in exports. Industry is
also counting on increased output in the near future. This mild
improvement will not make any immediate effect on employment in the
industrial sector, though. EU industry's utilisation capacity was running
at 80.8% in July, which is much the same as the level reported in the
previous quarter. As for consumers, they are now less pessimistic about
their own financial circumstances and future developments.

TAXATION: COMMISSION WORRIED ABOUT GERMAN CAR INCENTIVES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Should Germany be allowed to provide tax incentives now for cars that
already meet the next round of vehicle emission standards recommended
under the Auto Oil air quality programme, which are still only at the
proposal stage? As the matter has now taken an almost exclusive political
turn (with "mistakes" being committed by all sides), it will be up to
European Commissioners to give an answer to the question, during their
October 30 meeting. On top of the political irritant, there are a series
of legal "hitches" that can be traced right back to the complex
compromises that preceded the adoption of the last Directive on motor
vehicle pollution.

The European Commission sent a letter to the German authorities last
September 23 to notify them that their draft Bill intended to allow lower
road taxes for cars that are more environmentally-friendly than required
by the standards in the Auto Oil proposals (tabled by the European
Commission on June 18) were out of step with EU legislation (see European
Report N   2161). Germany meekly withdrew its proposed Bill and it was
thought that was the end of the matter. Determined to press on with their
tax breaks, the German authorities soon tabled a new Bill and this too
offered tax incentives starting in 1997 but they are supposed to apply to
cars that comply with the standards provided in the Auto Oil proposals.
The Bill is therefore based on standards that are less strict than in the
previous plan.

They might, however, turn out to be too strict for the Commission's taste.
The matter is nevertheless still a highly controversial one. Article 3 of
Directive 94/12/EC (on motor vehicle pollution) certainly argues the case
for a unfavourable opinion from the Commission: it proposes that Member
States may provide tax incentives only for vehicles complying with the
requirements in this same Directive (the standards in the German Bill
extend beyond the confines of the Directive and are based on a proposal
that has still not been adopted by the EU Member States, far from it).
However Article 4 of Directive 94/12 argues the case for retaining the
German Bill: it specifies that the Commission and industry have to consult
under the Auto Oil programme in order for the Commission to recommend a
further tightening of the standards before the end of 1994 and that these
proposals should be adopted by the Council of Ministers before the end of
1996. Even though the Commission is not entirely to blame, the Auto Oil
proposals in the end were not presented until mid-1996 and have yet to be
adopted. There are therefore grounds for considering that Germany could
legitimately expect to be able to introduce, starting on January 1, 1997,
tax incentives for cars that are cleaner than required by the 94/12
standards (the Auto Oil proposals envisage the same kind of article as
Article 3 in the Directive 94/12).

Faced with the politico-technical conundrum, the Commission is feeling
extremely uncomfortable about the idea of refusing to allow Germany to
press on with its plan. "The Commission might well decide not to run the
risk of being taken by Germany to the EU Court of Justice for
non-observance of Article 4 of Directive 94/12", according to officials
closely involved with the matter. Admittedly, Article 4 made it possible,
when the Directive was being adopted, to rally the support of certain
countries which have long been more to the fore on the environmental
protection front. But is also completely unrealistic, in that it leaves
the Commission only a few months in which to define its position in the
face of the powerful interests of the motor industry and the oil industry.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

COMMISSION ADOPTS TAX SYSTEMS REPORT

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

A European "code of good conduct" has to be developed to prevent national
tax policies continuing to be threatened by too much fiscal competition
between Member States, said European Commissioner for Taxation Mario
Monti, when presenting on October 22 the report the European Commission
had just adopted on the development of tax systems (see previous issue of
European Report for further details).

The erosion of the tax base is the main problem singled out by the
Commission, which recommends setting up a high-level forum, or a "Fiscal
Policy Committee" that with its overview of policies would work on
developing a code of good conduct for use by the Member States. "It is not
the proposals that are lacking, it is a consensus that is missing", Mr
Monti stressed once again, referring to the numerous proposals that seek
to complete the European fiscal area but have been held up in the EU
Council of Ministers for many years owing to the rule on unanimous voting.
"Nowadays it is much more often the markets, and no longer the Member
States, that are sovereign", he lamented, calling for greater coordination
between the Member States. "If the countries were to exercise this
sovereignty together, they might then be able to recover it from the
markets". He urged the Member States to coordinate their fiscal policies
more.

Minimising tax evasion, ensuring the smooth functioning of the Single
Market, promoting employment and environmental protection are just some of
the main themes in this report due to be presented to EU government
leaders at their December 13/14 Summit in Dublin. It will first be
examined by EU Finance Ministers in November. The report argues the need
to reverse the current trend towards an increasing burden on labour.

EMPLOYMENT: PARLIAMENT APPROVES NEW LABOUR MARKET POLICY COMMITTEE

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The proposal for a Council Decision to set up an "Employment and Labour
Market Policy Committee" was endorsed by the European Parliament's plenary
session in Strasbourg on October 24. The report by Ioannis Theonas (EUL,
Greece), which formed the basis for the Parliament's Opinion, recognises
that such a Committee would remedy a deficiency by creating an official
and stable structure charged with monitoring employment policy and the
implementation of multi-annual programmes.

The Parliament believes this Committee should strengthen coordination
between the employment policies of the different Member States. It should
also participate in preparatory work on the annual report on the
employment situation and the joint report submitted to the European
Council.

The creation of a Committee similar to the Economic Policy Committee set
up in 1974, with the objective of promoting the coordination of Member
States' short- and long-term economic policies, was first proposed at the
informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers in October 1995. Since March
1995, monitoring of the employment situation has been the responsibility
of the ad hoc group of personal representatives of Labour and Employment
Ministers. However, this group has encountered difficulties in fulfilling
the task assigned to it, because of the lack of resources at its disposal.

The European Commission believes the Committee should serve to: - monitor
employment trends in the EU;

- examine Member States' employment and labour market policies;

- exchange information and experience between the Member States and with
the Commission;

- prepare reports and recommendations on these questions; and

- draw up an annual comparative report on the employment situation in the
Member States and the policies followed by the latter.

A preliminary agreement on setting up the new Committee was secured at the
Social Affairs Council on September 24, and should be ratified at the
December 2 Council (see European Report N   2160 for further details).

EMI TO UNVEIL EURO BANKNOTES THIS YEAR

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Monetary Institute is expected to unveil the new Euro
banknotes this year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy announced on
October 22. These banknotes will begin circulating on January 1, 2002 at
the latest. The EMI, precursor to the future European Central Bank,
launched a competition to design the Euro in mid-February, restricted to
artists specialising in the design of banknotes and designated by the
Central Banks of the European Union Member States. The final choice must
be approved by the EMI Council, which is composed of the Governors of the
15 Central Banks of the European Union, at a meeting later this year,
although no date has yet been set, Institute sources in Frankfurt said.
The EMI has received 44 proposed designs for the Euro. "I believe that we
will be able to announce the result of the selection process this year",
Mr Lamfalussy told a gathering of German businessmen.

A committee of specialists chose two themes for the future currency:
European historical periods and styles, and modern or abstract designs. Mr
Lamfalussy indicated that the first theme had been used in 27 of the
designs. A spokesman for the EMI explained that every aspect of each entry
is now being examined to determine whether it meets the criteria laid
down. Each denomination (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 or 500) must bear the
name of the currency, the initials of the European Central Bank in five
languages (BCE, ECB, EZB, EKB, EKP) and the stars symbolising the European
Union. The notes must also incorporate the latest anti-counterfeiting
technology (a watermark, a security thread that turns black on
photocopies, colour-changing inks) and be easily distinguishable by the
visually impaired.

POLE TO HEAD EAST EUROPE BRANCH OF COLLEGE OF EUROPE.

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, well-known in Brussels as Poland's chief negotiator
- until just weeks ago - with the EU, has been appointed as Rector of the
College of Europe in Natolin, on the outskirts of Warsaw. He will take up
his appointment at the start of 1997. The College in Natolin was set up
two years ago, largely with PHARE programme funding, to provide a sister
establishment to the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium, but with a
particular focus on Central and Eastern Europe. The 60+ students who
follow postgraduate European studies courses there each year come from
most EU and EFTA countries, most of the Central and East European
countries, and from countries in the former USSR. The teaching faculty
includes eminent visiting lecturers from across Europe and from Polish
political, administrative and academic circles. There is to be an official
opening ceremony for the College on November 6.

ECSC: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SEEKS REVISIONS IN DRAFT 1997 BUDGET

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The European Commission's draft 1997 Operating Budget for the European
Coal and Steel Community, which cuts all items of expenditure except aid
for research, should be modified to fall in line with Parliament requests,
especially those concerning continuing ECSC aid for redeployment,
restructuring and research. Such were the conclusions of a Resolution on
the Budget adopted without amendment by the Parliament in plenary session
on October 24.

The Parliament is anxious to ensure that the necessary measures are taken
to prepare for the period after 2002, when the ECSC Treaty will expire,
and in the meantime that existing credits are used as wisely as possible.
In its Resolution, the Parliament said that the proposed operating budget
of ECU 265.5 million - an increase of ECU 24.5 million over the 1996 one -
is inconsistent with the run-down of activities implied by the plan to
phase out the Treaty. Also, noting that real needs estimated by the
Commission are of the order of ECU 172 million rather than ECU 265.5
million, the Parliament contests the Commission's decision to set aside
surplus revenue appropriations of ECU 93.5 million - almost the total sum
of resources derived from the levy on companies in the coal and steel
sectors - as a reserve for the successor body to the ECSC. For the
Parliament, the proposed Budget represents an imbalance between available
resources and requirements and, by containing a provisions for subsequent
financing, runs counter to the principle of an annual budget.

In its Resolution, the Parliament proposes increasing the sums allotted
for redeployment aid (from 56 to ECU 60 million), research (from 82 to ECU
91 million), conversion aid (from 7 to ECU 11 million) and social measures
in the coal industry (from 22 to ECU 26 million). It would also provide
ECU 5 million for the preparation of a successor body to the ECSC while
reducing the proposed reserve for this organisation from ECU 93.5 million
to ECU 67.5 million.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL: AGENDA STRETCHES FROM CUBA TO SINGAPORE, VIA
AFRICA AND RUSSIA

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

The meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg on October 28
and 29 has a full agenda, with decisions expected on international trade
matters - notably the anti-Helms/Burton law measures and the preparations
for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore in December, on international
political matters - notably in the Middle East and former Yugoslavia, and
on crucial EU affairs including progress with the Inter-Governmental
Conference and with the preparations for Eastern enlargement of the
European Union.

The EU's response to the US Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislation is almost
ready. The Council will be asked to decide on the "blocking statute" - a
draft Council Regulation and a draft Joint Action - which would together
protect against the effects of third-country (for which, read "US")
legislation on EU trade with third countries (for which read "Cuba",
"Iran" and "Libya"). The draft EU measures are subject to some questions
still - with reservations on specific questions from the UK, Germany and
Spain (principally, non-compliance, recovery of damages, and scope), and
with Denmark opposed to the entire legal base of the draft Regulation. But
the Presidency says that discussions have now reached a point where it is
up to Ministers to take a decision. The European Parliament was expected
to give its Opinion on the proposals on October 25.

The Middle East features in several of the agenda items: the Council will
examine the Middle East peace process in the light of recent EU and Member
State contacts there, and will discuss the possible appointment of an EU
envoy in the region - although no precise EU view has yet been established
of an envoy's role or status (unofficial candidates are being discussed
already, however, with an informal short list including the Spanish
Ambassador to Israel, and a number of Italian and Swedish names); European
Commissioner for relations with Mediterranean countries Manuel Marin will
report orally on negotiations for a Euro-Mediterranean Association
Agreement with Egypt; the Council will be asked to adopt the common
position on the 10th session of the Cooperation Council with Egypt - which
will take place on October 28 at midday (see separate article in Section
V); and over the following a lunch broader political issues will be
discussed.

On the Inter-Governmental Conference, the Council will look particularly
at external action of the EU under the headings of Common Foreign and
Security Policy, external economic relations, and security and defence,
where the Presidency is seeking political direction from Ministers (see
separate article in this issue). The Ministers are planning an exchange of
views with the President of the European Parliament, but no formal
discussion of the recent Franco-German proposal on closer cooperation (see
Document with this issue of European Report) is planned by the Presidency,
which has merely noted the paper as one of several contributions to the
IGC discussions, but is taking no view of it. The Member States' personal
representatives will discuss flexibility at their own IGC meeting in
Luxembourg on October 29.

Ministers will also meet their counterparts from the ten applicants from
Central and Eastern Europe on October 29, with talks focusing on progress
in the pre-accession strategy, the IGC, and - over lunch - current
international issues, particularly former Yugoslavia and Russia.

Other matters up for examination at the Council include:

- progress in establishing an EU Monitoring Centre on Racism and
Xenophobia (although no decision will emerge until later this year);

- former Yugoslavia, with a report from the EU's High Representative
there, Carl Bildt, on the postponement of elections and other recent
developments, as well as discussion and probable adoption of Conclusions
on a regional approach for EU relations with South Eastern Europe and on
policy guidelines for EU input into upcoming international meetings on
former Yugoslavia;

- the probable adoption of EU guidelines for upcoming meetings of the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe;

- support for transition to democracy in Zaire (with a Belgian-inspired
discussion on the recent developments in the Great Lakes region); and

- the probable adoption of Conclusions setting out guidelines on EU
preparation for the WTO Ministerial meeting in Singapore on December 9-13
(with discussion focusing on trade in relation to labour standards,
tariffs, textiles, environment and investment). The Council will hear a
progress report on the telecommunications talks and consider the
newly-proposed mandate for the EU to begin negotiations with major trading
partners on an international Information Technology Agreement (see last
issue of European Report).

The Council is also scheduled to sign a Framework Agreement with South
Korea (see last issue of European Report). And the Council is expected to
decide on suspending trade concessions for Burma under the Generalised
System of Preferences (see separate article on the European Parliament's
Resolution).

IGC '96: MEPS WARY OF DUBLIN SUMMIT OUTCOME

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

Members of the European Parliament are expressing doubts about the outcome
of the special EU Summit hosted by the Irish Presidency on October 5 in
Dublin to try and inject some impetus into the negotiations on
institutional reform ahead of the EU's expansion to the East. In a
Resolution adopted on October 23 in Strasbourg by 328 to 34 with 83
abstentions, MEPs noted that EU government leaders had oft-repeated their
commitment to ensuring the Inter-Governmental Conference on the Maastricht
Treaty review is concluded next June in Amsterdam. However, MEPs want to
ensure that this should not serve as an excuse for scaling down the
ambitions. Meanwhile, the Franco-German proposals for ways of promoting
closer cooperation between small groups of countries has been given a
cautious welcome in some EU quarters. Personal representatives of Foreign
Ministers are due to consider the proposals on October 30 in the context
of the IGC. (European Report is publishing, as a supplement to this issue,
a full version of the Franco-German proposals on greater cooperation.)

Tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, the Parliamentary
Resolution expresses concern about the EU's Summit's failure to move
forward on institutional reforms. The European Commission's President, who
was there to take part in the Parliamentary debate, agreed that "the
positions adopted by the delegations were still a far cry from what is
needed" and a great deal of progress had yet to be made in this area. The
Parliament nonetheless applauds the EU's resolve to stick to the timetable
and in particular to round the talks off next June in Amsterdam. However,
MEPs call for the draft Treaty, due to be presented by the Irish
Presidency prior to the EU Summit in Dublin, to "demonstrate the Union's
capacity to acquire instruments adequate to the important commitments it
will have to fulfill in the near future".

Generally speaking, the Parliament has stressed its commitment to the idea
of introducing a Treaty chapter on employment, adopting effective measures
to provide the EU with a Common Foreign and Security Policy and creating a
genuine Euro-wide policy based on internal security and freedom. The
Resolution underscores the need for decisions to be take by EU Heads of
State and Government when they gather for the next European Council in
Dublin, on December 13/14. Several MEPs in the Socialist, Christian
Democrat, Liberal and Green camps are leaning on the Member States'
governments to make a commitment soon to a full-blown public debate on the
EU reform process.

In the wake of an amendment tabled at the last minute, the Parliament gave
its reaction to the Franco-German plan to introduce a "general clause on
closer cooperation" allowing those who wish and have the ability to do so,
to move at a faster pace towards economic and political integration. The
Parliament judges that "any increased cooperation under the various
pillars must be achieved with due regard for the institutional framework,
the acquis communautaire and the objectives of the Union and must be open
to all Member States at any time".

Caution and flexibility.

The Franco-German idea of having a Maastricht Treaty clause to allow
certain countries to improve their cooperation in certain areas has been
given a cautious welcome. The Member States and the Commission are
planning to go through the proposal with a fine tooth comb. "The issue of
flexibility is one of the more importance ones to emerge from the
Inter-Governmental Conference. There is a strong feeling that there is a
need for something in this area, but there is also a very strong feeling
that this matter has to be given cautious consideration", Noel Dorr, the
current IGC Chairman, opined on October 22. During initial talks about the
flexibility proposals, several Member States voiced fears about the risk
of the Single Market being undermined. In Commission circles, the feeling
is that the text, which still has to be converted into articles (and this
will take some time), is going in the right direction.

The Commission has several reasons to be pleased. First of all the French
and Germans are seeking to apply enhanced cooperation in areas where
unanimous decision-making is required.

Second, the flexibility strategy is bracketed by stringent principles,
such as the need to retain the single institutional framework: no Member
State would enjoy a right of veto, no Member State would be excluded, and
there must be full respect for the EU's legislative achievements, for
Community law and the Treaty objectives. These principles would be
guaranteed by verification procedures enforced by the EU Court of Justice,
in particular, acting in response to a request from a Member State not
taking part in the enhanced cooperation.

A third reason to be pleased is the Franco-German determination not to
tamper with the Single Market: the flexibility strategy would not apply to
the EU legislative achievements and therefore to the Internal Market and
common polices. In the case of the first pillar, the Franco-German plan
stresses that "the need to list the possible areas would have to be
examined". The idea has been proposed for the flexibility approach to be
used, for example, by Economic and Monetary Union participants to converge
their tax laws, indeed even their compulsory levy systems, if unanimity
voting is to continue in these two areas by the end of the IGC. France and
Germany's partners believe the system has the major drawback of imposing
rules on those who intend to join the Euro zone at a later date, without
having allowed the newcomers to have their say.

Another advantage of the flexibility strategy is that in the context of
the Common Foreign and Security Policy and defining a common defence
policy, enhanced forms of cooperation may help to take account, without
necessarily having too suffer the consequences, of the specific
circumstances of certain Member States and in particular of the neutrality
of the Nordic countries, Ireland and Austria. The Franco-German plan
proposes to set a minimum threshold of Member States for implementing the
closer cooperation plan.

As far as France and Germany are concerned, the flexibility would be
another kettle of fish in the context of Maastricht's third pillar
(cooperation between the courts and police forces, immigration, right of
asylum, visas, combating drug-trafficking and crime). In this broad policy
area, the Franco-German plan envisages measures to slacken the system for
Conventions so that they would be able to come into effect after a certain
number of ratifications by the Member States (and solely for the States
having ratified according to a threshold to be set on a case-by-case basis
as well as scope for concluding Conventions with less than 15 countries,
thus committing only States that are parties to the Convention) and the
implementation of operational measures and material cooperation between
certain Member States.

The Franco-German plan certainly has its appeal, not least in the way it
seeks to prevent Community activities from being thrown into a state of
paralysis. However, the closer cooperation idea raises a series of
questions of a technical nature that have to be debated before being able
to be included in the Treaty. It also raises the fundamental question of
how the system will operate. Instead of providing a coherent view of
Europe, the numerous alliances could, on the contrary, end up by creating
disorder. The Member States would all be able to live under the same roof
- the European Union - but would proceed at different speeds. In theory,
and here were are looking some way into the future, countries joining the
single currency will not necessarily be the same ones taking part in
military operations in the Middle East, say, nor those who have
established an area in which people may move without obstruction. Against
this background, what will become of the family spirit and in particular
the financial solidarity on which the European Community is built? The
Franco-German plan still has to be spelled out in a bit more detail, but
it is possible to see that the initiative could act like a tonic on the
institutional negotiations: if it creates enough fear, it may induce the
Member States to be more ambitious about extending qualified majority
voting, to which the Germans and French are in theory still committed.

1997 EU BUDGET: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF ECU 800
MILLION

from EUROPEAN REPORT, 26 October 1996, No. 2169

On October 24, the European Parliament in first reading proposed an
increase of some ECU 800 million to the draft European Union General
Budget for 1997 adopted by the EU Council of Ministers in July. Payment
appropriations emerge from the Parliament's first reading at ECU 82.514
billion, compared with the 81.646 billion voted by the Council. The
increase advocated by MEPs would chiefly benefit spending linked to the
functioning of the Internal Market - with an additional ECU 300 million
for the trans-European networks - research and development, the Northern
Ireland peace programme and external relations.

The European Parliament subscribed to the principal amendments tabled by
its Committee on Budgets on reports by the Dutch MEP Laurens Jan
Brinkhorst (on the General Budget and the European Commission's Budget)
and the Spanish Member Juan Manuel Fabra Valles (on the Budgets of other
institutions - see separate article on the ECSC Operating Budget). The
Parliament has chosen not to question the horizontal reduction of ECU 1
billion in farm spending sanctioned by the Council of Ministers, excluding
exceptional spending on the beef and veal sector and costs linked to the
BSE crisis, and in Structural Fund spending except for the less-developed
regions of the Community.

By contrast, the Parliament exercised its rights within the limits of the
financial perspectives, and voted to re-enter credits on internal policies
linked to the internal market and on external relations, revoked be the
Council during its first reading. In respect of internal policies, the
MEPs have chosen to put in reserve ECU 300 million including ECU 73
million in a negative reserve to cover funding for the 14 priority
transport projects and the IVth Framework Programme of Research and
Development, and ECU 100 million for the Northern Ireland peace programme.
This accounting trick should enable funds to be lifted from current lines
in Section 3 of the Budget. MEPs also expanded budget lines on things such
as the environment, consumer protection, equal opportunities, information
and communication, anti-fraud measures and transport, for which the
Council had approved deep cuts (see table below).

Turning to external relations, the MEPs voted through a ECU 335 million
increase in payment appropriations over draft Budget approved by the
Council. Among others, this increase will benefit the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe and the former USSR, Mediterranean and Latin American
countries and cooperation with non-governmental organisations. The
Parliament voted to withhold aid intended for Turkey (ECU 53 million for
the EU/Turkey Customs Union and ECU 3.5 million for technical measures).
As regards the appropriation for the MEDA programme of assistance to
Mediterranean third countries, of which Turkey is just one beneficiary,
the Parliament and the European Commission have agreed to finance projects
linked to promoting democracy and respect for human rights and
strengthening civilian structures in Turkish society. By contrast, the
Parliament complied with a Commission request and rejected projects
intended for South-Eastern Anatolia. A working party made up of 5 MEPs and
the European Commissioners Manuel Marin (Relations with Mediterranean
States) and Hans van den Broek (External Political Relations) will be set
up to exercise prior control over projects the Commission proposes to
finance in Turkey in 1997. Finally, the European Parliament took a scythe
to the Common Foreign and Security Policy line.

The Budgets of EU institutions, and in particular the Commission, have
emerged from the Parliament's first reading with a number of
modifications. MEPs decided to put in reserve 26% of remuneration for
Commission officials, in order to force restructuring of the
Directorate-General for Enterprise Policy, Tourism and the Social Economy
(DG XXIII), following the scandals that have sullied the Tourism Unit.
They also voted to put in reserve 50% of the credits allocated to the
Directorate-General for Information and Communication (DG X) to force it
to review its information policy. Discipline demands, the institutions
will not increase their personnel next year. However, in order to
guarantee the proper functioning of the institutions, the Assembly
approved a recommendation from Mr Fabra Valles, and voted to increase by
ECU 1.37 million the overall amount allocated to the Council of Ministers,
the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social
Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the joint ESC/CoR structure.
This increase will finance measures involving personnel at the Court of
justice (ECU 154,000 on ECU 1.138 million), the ESC (ECU 16,486 on 90,158)
and the joint organisational structure (ECU 55,000 on 142,348).

These sums are not final. The Council of Ministers can reinstate a more
austere Budget in its second reading on November 19. However in respect of
so-called non-compulsory spending (with the exception of agriculture), the
MEPs will have the last word in December. Between the two readings, the
Parliament hopes to succeed in negotiating two agreements with the Council
and the Commission. The first concerns the forty budget lines that
correspond to pilot projects and Community programmes whose credits are
not allocated for want of a legislative act of the Council. The second
concerns the financing of EU fisheries agreements with third countries, on
which the Parliament is anxious to have its say.

Criticism of the execution of the 1996 Budget.

The European Parliament has also adopted a highly critical resolution on
the execution of the 1996 Budget, tabled by British Conservative MEP James
Elles. The Assembly criticises the wretched quality of budget forecasts in
the farming sector, denounces the poor rate of execution of the Structural
Funds budget, and disapproves of the Commission's deliberate refusal to
enact articles concerning the promotion of inter-regional cooperation
actions and the centre for enterprise and innovation, on the grounds that
similar actions could be financed through the structural funds. MEPs have
also expressed concerns over the slow-down in the execution of the budget
of Community actions supporting peace in the Middle East and has called on
the Commission, without delay, to provide information on the planned use
of credits covering special aid to refugees in the Republics of the former
Yugoslavia.
