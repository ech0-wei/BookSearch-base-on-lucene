APPN COMPLEXITY, TOKEN RING THROUGHPUT LEAVE AS/400 OUT OF
NETWORKING GAME

Difficulties in implementing Advanced Peer to Peer Networking
(APPN) and slow Token Ring interfaces are causing the AS/400
minicomputer to fall short of its communications potential,
experts said this week.

Despite its advanced functions, IBM's 18-month-old AS/400 has not
yet become much more than a file server or terminal controller.
Users and analysts say that many of the unit's more advanced
capabilities, such as APPN, are far too complicated for the
smaller companies installing it.  The real test, they say, will
come when the AS/400 enters larger SNA networks.

When it introduced the AS/400 in June 1988, IBM made many
communications promises, including to support multiple
architectures such as SNA, OSI, and TCP/IP.  IBM said the
minicomputer would communicate and operate with both IBM and
non-IBM products.

To back up its promises, IBM introduced OS/400, the AS/400
operating system.  OS/400 contains built-in support for Advanced
Program-to-Program Communications (APPC, also known as LU 6.2),
APPN, Distributed Data Management (DDM), Token Ring, and a host of
office information architectures.

According to most observers, the AS/400 can fulfill IBM's promises
under the current OS/400 release.  But putting these capabilities
into practical use is no easy task.

COMPLEXITY NOT AVOIDED

"The need to support a confusing array of protocols and approaches
to data communication had to be satisfied without creating a
system that was difficult to program, operate, or use," stated a
1989 report from ADM Inc. (Cheshire, Conn.), an AS/400
consultancy.  "The AS/400 must support SNA while avoiding the
complexity associated with management of an SNA network."

However, most AS/400 users do not use its advanced communications
features.  Observers say that although OS/400 has the potential to
support distributed communications, APPC and APPN are too complex
to be useful to smaller users.

"APPN requires a major programming effort, and once it's done,
it's very specialized -- not for the common user," observed Bruce
Armstrong of Link Computer Corp. (Altoona, Pa.), an AS/400
remarketer.  "There's no question that APPN could solve many
problems we are seeing, but I don't seeing it solving anything
soon.  The simplicity just isn't there."

Armstrong said his company has yet to install any AS/400s in the
APPN or Token Ring environments.

TOKEN RINGS NOT THERE, EITHER

"There are a lot of AS/400 systems out there that have been
developed without a network design.  They're not set up to
[interconnect]," Armstrong said.  "We had a situation recently
where a company had 300 terminals and a mixture of PCs, but no
Token Ring activity."

One reason for the lack of Token Ring implementations may be
throughput problems, noted Armstrong.  "There are problems with
AS/400s on a Token Ring -- it has been brought up at Common [IBM's
small systems user group] meetings.  IBM still has a ways to go in
trying to get PC networks [to link with] AS/400s."

Others familiar with the AS/400's networking capabilities agreed.

"We are just starting to see Token Rings attaching to AS/400s.  We
have just gotten many clients off of coaxial cable onto twisted
pair.  Now it will be easy for them to go to Token Ring," said
George Woodring, director of technical services at ADM.  "Token
Ring takes planning and knowledge of what it can do to be
effective.  There's not that much expertise out there in the
AS/400 world."

ADM recently installed its first APPN network.

"The customer was afraid once the switch was made to APPN, he
would lose performance.  [The customer wasn't] too familiar with
what APPN could do," Woodring said.  "We did find that 9600 baud
wasn't cutting it with 16 to 18 communication lines, but we upped
it to 19.2 Kbps, and it worked fine."

LITTLE CRITICALS

Other companies -- such as the Travelers Insurance Companies
(Hartford, Conn.) and Mobil Oil (New York, N.Y.) -- have installed
APPN, but they are few and far between, according to analysts.
And even large corporations that can afford APPN networks are
doing very little mission-critical work on them.

The few AS/400s that handle communications tasks today act
as hosts in small environments or replace IBM's aging 43XX
mainframe computers.  Even there, the AS/400 serves primarily
as a stand-alone unit.

"We have 18 remote sites in the U.S. and Canada, basically spread
out in a star formation with links back to Lincoln," explained
John Edson, manager of administrative services and information
systems for Norden Laboratories (Lincoln, Neb.), a distributor of
veterinary health products.

Norden's network is based on SNA protocols, Edson said, and the
AS/400 has never had a problem communicating in that environment.

Woodring said the AS/400s he has installed have worked well in the
SNA environment.

"The biggest problem there has been [is with] customers trying to
implement it without first-hand knowledge of what it can do,"
Woodring commented.  "The initial release of OS/400 was
unforgiving if you made a mistake.  Now, it's much easier.  But
none of it is easy without some experience."

Still, within the larger SNA environment, the AS/400 cannot act as
a control point, but only as a controller.  In that role, it has
performed well, according experts.  The AS/400 will eventually
play an important role in bringing about the move to APPN,
analysts said, but it's not doing it yet.  (Michael Cooney)

IBM WILL CHANGE THE 3745, BUT MAYBE NOT UNTIL 1992

Some potential customers are re-thinking their decisions to
purchase the IBM 3745 Communication Controller because of a
rumored forklift upgrade.  Observers say the fear of major changes
in the front-end processor could be justified, but those changes
probably will not happen in 1990.

Although it has been on the market for two years, the 3745 has not
made tremendous inroads in SNA networks, observers say.  Since new
technology is making product cycles shorter and IBM has no great
stake in maintaining the 3745, some potential customers are
getting skittish.

"We had a couple of customers who were worried about IBM pulling
the plug on the 3745," commented Thad Kemp at computer lessor
Stamford Computing Group, (Stamford, Conn.).  "A couple of months
ago, that perception was a real problem, but it doesn't seem to be
bothering anyone now.  Word is that the 3745 won't be changed that
radically until 1992."

Other observers concurred with that forecast.

"We see IBM coming out with its follow-on
mainframe -- Summit -- in 1992, so we would expect to
see a new communication box sometime after that," stated
Bill Husband, senior consultant with the Meridian Group
(Deerfield, Ill.), also a computer lessor.  "The rule of thumb
we use is that for every MIP added to the machine, customers
can add 10 communications lines.  With the four to eight-fold
increase we foresee in power over the next couple years, we'll
have to see some sort of upgrade."

NOT TIME TO DUMP THE FAMILY

Since it was enhanced last May, the 3745 family covers most
customers' requirements, noted Dave Wolff, executive vice
president of El Camino Resources (Northridge, Calif.).  For most
users, however, the Network Control Program (NCP) operating system
still has a way to go.

"It is conceivable IBM could change the 3745 again, but not in the
near term," Wolff said.  "The 3745 is selling at a reasonable
clip, and the high end isn't losing to the competition like it
used to."

Indeed, IBM does not lose to too many competitors in the front-end
processor market.  According to Computer Intelligence (La Jolla,
Calif.), IBM has an 88 percent market share.  NCR Comten holds a 6
percent share, and Amdahl holds a 2 percent share.

Of this 88 percent, the 3725 still makes up the bulk of the
installed base (40 percent), with the older 3704 and 3705 coming
in second (20 percent).  The low-end 3720 comes in third (10
percent), and the 3745 thus far has garnered only 6 percent.

"It's been a slow, steady migration to the new models," observed
Ralph Busch of Computer Intelligence.  "[But] we haven't seen any
slowdown recently that would indicate a problem."

3725 IN VOGUE

Busch recommended that customers worried about the 3745 -- or
perhaps not ready to spend the money to upgrade -- should look at
buying a used 3725, which his numbers show being worth only about
10 percent of its original value.

"If all a customer needs is a little more channel space, then it
should look that way," Busch said.

Kemp pointed out that if customers are worried about floor space,
they should move to the 3745.  "The 3725  has a floor space
problem -- you'll need 3 or 4 of them to do what one 3745 does.
We know some customers who will move to the 3745 for that reason
alone."

Wolff said that if IBM changed the architecture, 3745 customers
would likely receive a field upgrade before a forklift upgrade.
But he also said the 3725 suffices for many current users.

"The 3725 is a living boat anchor that will be around for a long
time.  There is nothing that the market is crying for right now.
IBM needs to get customers to use the 3745 more for now," Wolff
said.

Some customers are turning away from IBM entirely.  Donovan Data
Systems (New York, N.Y.), for example, went to the NCR Comten
5565.  This accounting and data processing service company is
primarily a Comten shop, but has looked at the 3745.

"Basically, [the 3745] couldn't provide the flexibility we
needed," said Ron Block, vice president at Donovan.  "We needed
multiple front ends in our VTAM [Virtual Telecommunications Access
Method] environment, which IBM couldn't do."

Although Comten and Amdahl generally offer better flexibility than
Big Blue, observers said the plug-compatible vendors in the 3745
arena are not affecting the big controller much.

1990 OR 1992?

IBM is battling itself on the 3745 issue, experts say.  The
front-end device may need some changes, such as higher speeds and
water cooling to help it handle growing SNA traffic.  The unit
will need these features when it becomes an APPN node, experts
said.

"With the increased amount of 80386 -- and now 80486 -- computers
to attach to it, the 3745 will have to change.  For that and other
reasons, I don't think it will last the year," projected Brian
Jeffery, managing director of the International Technology Group
(Los Altos, Calif.).  "IBM has a lot of communication products in
the pipeline, and the new [processor] hardware coming out will
force IBM to change the 3745 soon."

Others have said the 3745 was a short-term machine to begin with
and will fade away with the advent of APPN.

"Customers expect forklift upgrades from time to time, and product
cycles have sped up," commented David Passmore, a partner at
Network Strategies/Ernst and Young (Fairfax, Va.).  "But the time
for a forklift upgrade of the 3745 is at least two years away."

IBM RINGS IN NEW MULTIVENDOR OFFICE CONNECTIONS WITH SOFT SWITCH

IBM recently rang out the old by dumping its Office Interconnect
Facility (OIF) and rang in the new by signing Soft Switch Inc. to
provide multivendor office systems connectivity in IBM
environments.

IBM signed Soft Switch (Wayne, Pa.) under its Cooperative Software
Program (CSP) to provide host-based links between its OfficeVision
system and Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-In-One, Wang Office,
Hewlett-Packard's Desk Manager, and other office systems.

Soft Switch provides these connections through its Soft Switch
Central MVS or VM software.  Soft Switch describes Central as a
"full blown networking product" with "post offices" that interface
with SNA Distribution Services (SNADS), X.400, Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), DECnet, and other protocols.

STOPGAP STOPS DEAD

Soft Switch Central replaces OIF, which IBM said was never
shipped.

Originally announced in October 1989, OIF was designed to allow
users to exchange electronic mail messages between VM PROFS
(Professional Office System), MVS Personal Services/Customer
Information Control System (PS/CICS), and Distributed Office
Support System (DISOSS), DEC, and Wang.

At the time, observers labeled OIF a stopgap measure, but it never
even got that far.

"The OIF product would not meet our customers' requirements in the
required time span," an IBM spokesman said.  "The development
effort with Aratek [Toronto, Canada] never brought a product to
market, so we withdrew it and replaced it with Soft Switch."

Aratek did not respond by press time to questions about the
developments.

The Soft Switch product will meet customer needs better than OIF
would have, according to analysts.  The OIF product did not
support X.400, and it was not robust, commented one observer.

While Soft Switch Central contains an X.400 interface, it is not
the same one the company introduced in October 1989.  The 400 Link
is a dedicated X.400 gateway between PROFS and/or SNADS and other
X.400-compatible systems.  Soft Switch said it might eventually
put 400 Link on Central, but the X.400 interface is not a
requirement today.

"The death of OIF isn't going to cause any large scale mourning
throughout the industry," observed Brian Jeffery, managing
director for the International Technology Group (Los Altos,
Calif.).  "Soft Switch is a standard in the industry, and IBM
representatives who were called upon to provide these types of
connections would have called Soft Switch anyway.  The Soft Switch
product is just so much more functional [than OIF]."

SOLIDIFYING OFFICEVISION

Soft Switch's product is also important to OfficeVision's
long-term success because it will allow customers to mix and match
multivendor office offerings -- something OfficeVision does not
provide, analysts said.

"The point of the whole product is that OfficeVision won't care
what the other system it's communicating with is," said Donald
Fisher, vice president of open systems at Soft Switch.  "The
current release of OfficeVision doesn't hold much new for PROFS
users, but the next release will have an impact.  This product
will add to that."

In addition to OfficeVision/MVS and /VM, Soft Switch supports
AS/400 Office through a SNADS gateway and said it plans to offer
support for OfficeVision/400 by June.  It will also support
OfficeVision/2 at the low end in the near future, according to
Fisher.  "We are working with IBM now to set a development
schedule, [but] I would anticipate seeing something in 1990," he
stated.

OfficeVision itself is being held up by the delayed OS/2 Extended
Edition (EE), which was slated to appear last November but is now
scheduled for March 30.  OfficeVision/2 will get much of its
functionality from OS/2 EE.

"The whole push to homogeneous computing is happening on the front
lines of many offices today.  Any package that can move
information around without the user knowing what kind of system
it's coming from is a valuable asset," commented Peter Kastner,
vice-president of the Aberdeen Group (Boston, Mass.).  "The
biggest problem is that the whole OfficeVision kit and caboodle is
on hold until OS/2 EE and the LAN Server [also due March 30] are
released."  (Michael Cooney)

PRODUCT:
Soft Switch Central

DESCRIPTION:
Software package combining IBM's OfficeVision/MVS and
OfficeVision/VM environments with multivendor office packages such
as Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-In-One and Data General's CEO.

PRICING:
$40,000 to $250,000, depending on configuration.

AVAILABILITY:
All products are available now, except for connections to
OfficeVision/2.  That interface will probably appear in 1990.

THE IBM COOPERATIVE SOFTWARE PROGRAM

Formed as a pilot program in June 1987 and initiated in January
1988, IBM's Cooperative Software Program has grown to include
approximately 75 software vendors in the U.S.

CSP's purpose is to bring in established third-party software
vendors to provide solutions in niche areas where IBM does not
offer a product.

Both IBM and its software partner (in this case, Soft Switch) sell
the programs, though IBM is not responsible for product licensing,
terms, conditions, or pricing.  The third party provides service
and training as well.

"CSP gives the software company greater exposure [to the business
world], and we get to offer our customers an established solution
for their networks," an IBM spokesman said.

IBM PUTS WEIGHT BEHIND FDDI PUSH WITH SMT FORUM MEMBERSHIP

IBM last month boosted its support of Fiber Distributed Data
Interface (FDDI) standards by joining the SMT (Station Management)
Development Forum, an organization advocating the rapid and
uniform development of SMT and FDDI.

The SMT protocol provides the intelligence that links workstations
to a network and allows those stations to be centrally managed.
SMT is the only portion of the 100 Mbps FDDI standard still
undefined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
Once SMT is resolved, vendors could begin developing interoperable
FDDI systems (see sidebar).

SMT Development Forum members will jointly define interoperable
design specifications for FDDI SMT, according to Synernetics Inc.
(North Billerica, Mass.), the FDDI LAN management specialist that
initiated the forum.  The SMT Forum specification will build on
the ANSI standard, but will provide additional details necessary
for actual product development, Synernetics said.

"The Forum provides members the benefits of a large, focused
development team at a fraction of the total cost required for
individual design specification development efforts," said Bruce
McClure, president and co-founder of Synernetics.  "The resulting
open specification will be available to all Forum members."

PUSHING FIBER

IBM's forum participation is part of its recent push into the FDDI
arena.  Last January, Big Blue invested in PCO Inc. (Chatsworth,
Calif.), a fiber optic interface company.  In September, IBM
scientists announced two experimental FDDI computer chips capable
of transmitting and receiving a billion bits per second.

"FDDI is a hot topic for IBM, and 1990 will make it even hotter,"
commented Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network
Architects (Washington, D.C.).  "I expect to see some FDDI
products in IBM's LAN environment by the end of the year."

Analysts say fiber will be the primary medium in many
organizations' future backbones as well as between LANs in campus
environments.

Big Blue's graphics-oriented data systems division (DSD, Kingston,
N.Y.) is IBM's official forum member, leading some observers to
predict that IBM will initially push FDDI in the mainframe arena.
DSD makes the 3090.

LOSING THAT COPPER BUILD-UP

An IBM executive said last year that users could eventually see
fiber "anyplace a copper cable is now."  Big Blue also said fiber
may eventually show up inside -- or at least between -- IBM
mainframes.  Analysts note that the promised peer-oriented host of
the future certainly could use the extra bandwidth and speed of a
fiber optic network.

"There are many broad requirements for integrating corporate LANs,
relational databases, and networks," commented Bob Simko,
executive director of the International Technology Group (Los
Altos, Calif.).  "This forum  offers and promotes interoperability
between all the vendors out there.  This is very much an issue
with the end user."

Simko said the forum will help IBM spread the new technology and
vault back into a technological leadership role that it slipped
from in the late 1980s.

"IBM wants to strongly apply the concept of an enterprise
information system, and it will be taking advantage of these new
types of technologies to promote that," Simko stated.  "Right now,
IBM is working to coexist with [the other members] of the forum
with the long-term goal of converging them."

Other members of the SMT Development Forum include Apple, Advanced
Micro Devices, the CERN Laboratory for Particle Physics,
Interphase Corp., Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, National
Semiconductor Corp., SBE Inc., and Sumitomo Electric.

The forum did not offer a schedule for completing the
implementation specification.  Synernetics did say it will offer
its customers full documentation, complete integration support,
and SMT software updates as the FDDI standard evolves.  (Michael
Cooney)

SMT AGREEMENT WOULD MARK MAJOR FDDI MILESTONE

The Station Management (SMT) document, the stumbling block in
passing the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard,
should be ready for approval within a few months, according to
Floyd Ross, chairman of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) SMT working group.

FDDI, which is being defined by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) X3T9.5 committee, is an emerging local area
network (LAN) standard for 100 megabit per second (Mbps)
transmission over fiber optic media.

Chairman Ross predicted that by April, the SMT committee will have
a document that will essentially be the SMT standard. "There are
only details to work out [in the next few months]," he said.

However, with a fair amount of red tape still ahead, Ross said the
standard will not be officially completed until early 1991.

According to Ross, the station manager is the focal point of
network interoperability.  "The station manager acts as the
interface between any other management entity, monitors station
activity, monitors station configuration and capabilities, and
reconfigures the stations if there is a failure on the network."

There are four documents that make up the proposed standard:
Physical (PHY), Physical Media Dependent (PMD), Media Access
Control (MAC), and  Station Management (SMT).  Each segment
defines a different set of specifications for a different aspect
of the standard.

The PHY, PMD, and MAC define hardware specifications and are
already in final draft form at ANSI.  (Caryn Fox)

1990: HOTTER THAN USUAL?

Unlike the weather over the holiday season, SNA should get a
number of "hot" developments in 1990 to warm the cockles of many
an IBM customer's heart.

Of course everything can't be warm and fuzzy, but the year should
prove interesting for a number of reasons.

One of the hottest topics for 1990 won't even be SNA, but Open
Systems Interconnect (OSI).  With IBM's OSI/Communication
Subsystem (OSI/CS) for MVS coming out in March and a VM version
due in June, the OSI acronym will fly around Armonk in '90.

OSI/CS will support OSI layers 3 through 7 and let NetView manage
local and remote OSI systems without NetView/PC, among other
functions.  Just seeing that idea on paper seems strange to many
IBM watchers.

June will also bring IBM's OSI/File Services for MVS.  As an
OSI/CS application, File Services provide OSI File Transfer,
Access, and Management (FTAM) functions for the host.  A VM
version will be shipped in September.

All of these new products will give U.S. users a chance to see
exactly how IBM really performs in the OSI realm.  It's been a
long time coming.

SMOKY NETWORK MANAGEMENT

Network management will be a hot '90 SNA topic, although IBM's
specific plans are a little hazy.  The ability to manage non-IBM
OSI devices via OSI/CS is quite a breakthrough, but how much will
it help non-OSI customers?  Probably not much.

Most network management experts say IBM will improve its
management of non-SNA devices, but none can say when that will
happen.  Until then, most customers will be left to roll their own
solutions or use NetView/PC (more on that later).

Third parties will continue to develop direct interfaces to
NetView without using NetView/PC, and users will benefit from more
efficient management of non-IBM devices.  The price tag, however,
may be high.

A Blue graphical user interface will be here in 1990, making the
recently-purchased NetCenter Graphic Network Monitor a potential
dinosaur.  Whatever happens, a big, colorful, graphic NetView
monitor is definitely in the cards for '90.

Many large network managers starving for a database repository
remained hungry in 1989.  This year should provide a few more
glimpses of IBM's direction for this lukewarm offering.  However,
since Big Blue only issued a statement of direction in '89, it
will probably be 1991 before actual products take shape.

Without question, network management issues will be hot in 1990.
Time will tell if the pot will just simmer or really boil over.

ALSO SIMMERING...

Also heating up in first quarter 1990 will be OS/2 and IBM's
OfficeVision products.

OS/2 Extended Edition (EE) 1.2 is scheduled to ship on March 30,
and with it will come a whole new array of goodies -- an SNA
gateway, Ethernet support, and a variety of other options.

From the LAN end, OfficeVision will join with OS/2 EE to sprout a
whole new crop of applications based on distributed processing.

Many observers say OfficeVision could replace IBM's Professional
Office System (PROFS) and Distributed Office Support System
(DISOSS), two key staples of the SNA network environment.  That
probably won't happen in too many shops this year, but the
possibility makes it a hot topic for 1990.

This year users should begin to reap the spoils of IBM's
all-out assault on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) market in 1989.  Experts watching the TCP/IP
field say IBM can offer TCP/IP support just about anywhere these
days -- so look for it in a network near you.

WHAT'S NOT HOT

Of course, everything can't be red hot in the Blue arena.  With
diminishing demand, the old dumb 3270 terminal will lose more face
in 1990.  Experts have been stomping on the resilient 3270
terminal for years without much real damage.  But in 1990, with
OS/2 finally showing some signs of life and some reasonable PS/2
and PC prices hitting the market, the growth of 3270 hardware will
slow even more.  Of course, "death" in this case may still mean 3
to 4 percent growth, but there are certainly some nails in its
coffin.

Another traditional slam-taker, NetView/PC, will continue taking
those slams despite picking up some new supporters in 1989.  Most
customers and third-party vendors are spending their time finding
ways to bypass NetView/PC.  Some observers go as far to say IBM
will officially pull the plug on this product in 1990.

IBM activity in the voice/data integration field cooled off in
1989, and will likely continue that route in 1990.  There could be
some interesting treaties with Northern Telecom and its peers, but
autumn is here for this area.

All in all, there seems to be more in IBM's oven than in
its deep freeze. IBM watchers predict 1990 will produce some hot
items -- at least enough to keep most customers warm.  (Michael
Cooney)

MOBILE COMPUTER SYSTEM COMING SOON, GARTNER SAYS

IBM may announce a mobile computer for the transportation industry
as early as the end of the quarter, according to a Gartner Group
analyst.

Mobile computers are essentially ruggedized laptops connected to a
transceiver and antenna.  IBM would not manufacture the latter
components, only the computer itself, said John Pemberton, an
analyst at Gartner (Stamford, Conn.).  Current mobile systems
generally use a non-intelligent terminal, rather than computer,
for data entry.

By switching to intelligent mobile systems, users could implement
distributed mobile applications, Pemberton noted.  If IBM made
them Systems Application Architecture (SAA) compatible, mobile
systems would become more useful to IBM customers, he said.

IBM planned to enter the market in the third quarter, but moved up
the announcement to the first quarter, Pemberton said.  The
machines will ship no later than first quarter 1991, but IBM is
aiming to beat that deadline, he added.

To be successful in the field, the systems must be accepted by the
major communication companies.  IBM has been courting Qualcomm,
American Mobil Satellite Corp., Telsat Mobile Inc., Geostar, and
other satellite communications companies to ensure this
acceptance, according to Pemberton.  Negotiations with Locstar
will be critical to the system's success in western Europe, he
observed.  (Dan Carney and Michael Cooney)

SNA WILL REMAIN IBM'S BABY DESPITE GROWING OSI INVESTMENT

IBM will continue to pour the majority of its research and
development (R&D) dollars into SNA, but the computer giant has
made a definitive investment in OSI, according to a recent Neil
Miles Ltd. (New York, N.Y.) research report.

"IBM is never going to do what some of its competitors are doing,
like DEC  [Digital Equipment Corp.] and HP [Hewlett-Packard Co.],
and that is replace its proprietary network protocols with OSI.
IBM will offer the ability to mix and match [SNA and OSI]," said
report author Rob Garretson.

The "Gateway To The Future" report does not break down the dollar
proportions spent on R&D for SNA and OSI, Garretson said, but it
does say while IBM has started a multi-million dollar OSI effort,
it will continue to spend billions on SNA development.

"I would say the proportion of development resources is at least
10 to one SNA to OSI," Garretson said.  He added that IBM spends
"tens of billions of dollars in R&D with a very wide palette of
research" but R&D is still heavily weighted towards SNA.

"Though IBM is making its first real definitive investment in OSI,
SNA is still [IBM's] baby," said Garretson.

Big Blue will provide multivendor portals to all customers who
want them, according to the report.  Garretson said an IBM
customer will have the option of using X.25 as the main transport
protocol across its SNA network, replacing IBM's Synchronous Data
Link Control (SDLC) protocol for wide area networking. (Beth

KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOFTWARE TOOL UNVEILED

IBM last week announced The Integrated Reasoning Shell (TIRS), an
application enabling tool that will help businesses create and use
knowledge-based applications within Big Blue's AD/Cycle and
Systems Application Architecture (SAA) frameworks.

IBM said the shell will make it easer for customers to
build specialized libraries of information and apply them to
problem-solving situations.  These knowledge bases can be
developed on OS/2 or AIX and run on the PS/2, AIX/RT, and S/370 VM
or MVS using the Runtime System.

Scheduled to be available in July, TIRS will cost $7,500 for the
Development System and $750 for the Runtime System on the PS/2 and
RT.  System/370 prices will range from $11,000 to $113,000 for the
Development System and $3,000 to $28,000 for the Runtime system.

MADGE NETWORKS INTRODUCES SOFTWARE DRIVER FOR SMART AT, MC
RINGNODES

Madge Networks Inc. (San Jose, Calif.) has introduced a software
driver that it says gives its 4 Mbps Smart AT and MC Ringnodes the
performance of IBM's 16 Mbps Token Ring.  Madge's Smart Server
software uses the IBM PS/2's busmaster capabilities and leaves the
CPU free by offloading low-level network activity onto the Token
Ring adapter.

The Smart Server automatically configures itself to the interrupts
and I/O of the Smart Ringnode and is compatible with Micro Channel
and AT-style PCs, Madge said.  Scheduled to be available this
quarter, Smart Server will be offered free to current Madge Smart
AT and MC Ringnode users.

ALPHASERVER 8400 ARRAY PERFORMANCE
SIMILAR TO MAINFRAME'S POWER

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced new technology,
PCI Memory Channel interconnect, that enables its highly
scalable AlphaServer systems to deliver new levels of
affordability and price/performance for the technical
computing market. Digital has showcased these new capabilities
in an array of eight AlphaServer 8400 systems with a total of
96 Alpha 64-bit processors running 64-bit Digital UNIX.

"Digital's new scalable AlphaServer 8400 array offers a
preview of the next generation in enterprise supercomputing,"
said Gary Smaby, president, Smaby Group, Inc. "By linking
dozens of its blazingly fast Alpha microprocessors through a
robust memory interconnect architecture, Digital has
constructed a mainframe-class computing platform for high-end
technical users tackling applications that benefit from
parallel processing. The system leverages the cost benefits of
commodity componentry to deliver a compelling
price/performance alternative to traditional supercomputers
and MPPs."

Digital makes high performance affordable for compute-
intensive, technical applications such as computational fluid
dynamics, computational chemistry, weather modeling, and
molecular and genetics research. Digital delivers outstanding
price/ performance by taking advantage of standard,
high-volume, low-cost components including a high-speed
interconnect and optimized software. As each processor
delivers 600 MFLOPS, a 96 processor system delivers 57.6
GFLOPS of computing power -- for only $4.5 million.

This combination of affordable price and high performance
enables a wide variety of users to attain performance levels
previously available only with expensive, specialized
supercomputers. Users who would never have been able to afford
supercomputer-class power can now do so with Digital's
systems.

"Digital is making high-performance computing affordable for
more applications than ever before," said Dr. Michael Levine,
scientific director, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. "We're
finding that Digital's approach to connecting AlphaServers is
elegantly simple, and both very powerful and very cost
effective. We can connect AlphaServers of different sizes,
which is important to us because it enables us to match our
systems and applications most efficiently. We're currently
using the system for molecular dynamics, visualization, finite
element and simulated annealing code, and think this
technology prepares us for the future of high-performance
computing."

Standards-based Commodity Components for Outstanding
Performance and Affordability

Digital delivers these new levels of price/performance by
leveraging commodity hardware and software components. A
standards- based PCI bus Memory Channel interconnect is used
to link multiple AlphaServer systems. This low-latency (less
than 5 microseconds), high-bandwidth (100 Mbytes/sec)
interconnect provides high-speed, memory-to-memory
communications among up to eight AlphaServer 8400 systems,
which allows the multiple systems to operate essentially as a
single system with 57.6 GFLOPS of power. The Memory Channel
interconnect can also link lower-cost AlphaServer 2000
systems for extremely cost-effective high-performance
solutions.

Digital also provides a suite of software tools that allows
technical users to optimize their applications for the new
technology. The software includes:

o Digital UNIX, the industry's only 64-bit UNIX operating
system, which provides greater standards-compliance and higher
performance than any other available UNIX operating system.

o High Performance Fortran (HPF), which allows the arrayed
systems to be programmed as easily as a single system. HPF
automatically optimizes communications among processors for
maximum performance and allows the system to be easily scaled
for a variable number of processors.

o Parallel Software Environment (PSE), which provides the
runtimes for HPF, and performance analysis and debugging tools
for developing parallel applications.

o Digital PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), an enhanced version
of public domain PVM, which facilitates the creation of
parallel applications.

o MPI (Message Passing Interface), software developed with
Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre, which enables users to
create parallel applications for these systems using an
optimized version of the industry-standard software for
message passing.

Digital's use of these standards-based, off-the-shelf hardware
and software components allow it to deliver systems that are
lower cost, easier to expand and simpler to program than
competitive systems.

"Digital is the leading provider of high-performance UNIX
solutions, as demonstrated by the industry's first
implementation of 64-bit UNIX in 1993, our Very Large Memory
systems last spring, and now the new level of price and
performance of arrayed systems," said Pauline Nist, vice
president, AlphaServer Business Segment, Digital Equipment
Corp. "Through our Technical Solutions Initiative, we have the
high-level expertise to deliver solutions that meet the unique
needs of users in the technical segment. The technology in
these AlphaServer arrays leverages the fastest processors,
the best interconnect, proven, shipping, software and low-cost
commodity components to deliver the best available
high-performance solutions for technical computing."

Digital's Very Large Memory (VLM) technology dramatically
improves application performance by increasing the amount of
information that can be stored in memory. Digital is the only
company delivering high-performance 64-bit servers,
AlphaServer systems, and a 64-bit operating system, Digital
UNIX, which together make VLM64 possible. Whereas 32-bit
systems are limited to 2 Gbytes of memory, AlphaServer 8400
systems can store up to 14 Gbytes of data in memory, for fast
access to large amount of data.

Digital's Technical Solutions Initiative provides customers in
engineering and scientific environments with complete
application solutions.

Through the Technical Solutions Initiative, Digital provides
AlphaStation and AlphaServer customers in mechanical design
and analysis, electronic design and analysis, geographic
information systems, technical CASE and science and research
with industry- leading application performance and
price-performance advantages.

Pricing and Availability

The hardware and software components in the AlphaServer array
will be available in January, 1996. The AlphaServer 8400
array with 96 processors; 4 gigabytes of memory; 32 gigabytes
of disk space; PCI Memory Channel interconnect; Digital UNIX,
HPF, PSE and Digital PVM is priced at $4.5 million. Other
complete configurations begin at $70,000, such as a system
with an AlphaServer 2000 array with 2 processors; 256 Mbytes
of memory; 4 gigabytes of disk space; PCI Memory Channel
interconnect; Digital UNIX, HPF, PSE and Digital PVM.

UNIX SERVERS REPLACE MAINFRAMES
IN NEW GLOBAL RESERVATION SYSTEM

Best Western International, Inc., the world's largest hotel
brand, has selected multiple AlphaServer 8400 "TurboLaser"
systems, the world's most powerful servers, together with
thousands of Digital personal computers, to power Best
Western's new worldwide central reservation system (CRS).

When fully implemented, the deal will be worth more than $12
million in Digital revenue. A total of 10 AlphaServer 8400
systems will power Best Western's operations center central
host server, located in Phoenix, Ariz., as well as BWI's
reservation centers located in Phoenix, Wichita, Kan., Dublin,
Ireland, and Milan, Italy. The new servers will run Oracle7
relational database management system with the 64-bit Digital
UNIX operating system, handling in excess of 2,000
transactions per second. AlphaServer systems will replace
outdated and over-extended mainframes.

In addition, Digital will deliver some 3,500 Digital Venturis
535 PCs to every Best Western property worldwide, where they
will provide a full range of inventory and rate management
capabilities. This part of the system will enable hoteliers to
enroll in Best Western marketing programs and create their own
programs and pricing packages.

"Today we unveil the hotel industry's most ambitious, advanced
customer reservation system. We selected the
Digital/Oracle/UNIX solutions because of its superior
performance, flexibility, and growth potential -- at one-tenth
the cost of competing systems," said William S. Watson, Best
Western International's executive vice president.

"We expect the Digital/Oracle solution to dramatically improve
our ability to respond more rapidly to customer needs, to
quickly provide our client agents more and more relevant
information on our customers' travel preferences, to increase
our sales and revenues, and to enhance our company's image,"
Watson added.

The new system is expected to to generate more than $50
million in incremental annual room revenue and will
significantly reduce corporate and property level operating
costs.

Pace-setting Global Reservation System

Best Western's new central reservations systems, scheduled for
a March 15, 1996, start-up, offers unprecedented features and
functions, both at the property level and at the Best Western
central reservations offices. It will be a service
enhancement for the 40 million travelers worldwide who stay at
Best Western hotels each year.


With the new CRS, Best Western will be the only hotel chain to
provide comprehensive geographic, pictorial, and textual
information to its reservation sales agents. These features
will enable guests who call a Best Western central reservation
office from any location, whether at home or on the road, to
find the Best Western hotel that is closest to their desired
destination.

The new system will enable Best Western to provide detailed
guest histories, group booking capabilities, revenue
management service, travel agent commission data, and a wide
range of property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
service, travel agent commission data, and a wide range of
property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
64-bit processors and 14 Gbytes of memory, and can be
clustered for far greater performance.

Recently, Digital and Oracle together shattered the
transaction processing world performance record in benchmark
testing (tpcC) defined and audited by the independent
Transaction Processing Performance Council. This was
accomplished on an AlphaServer 8400, Digital UNIX operating
system, and Oracle 7 database system. The Digital/Oracle
solution bested the previous record held by Hewlett Packard by
75 percent, and was far better than the best systems from IBM,
Sun, AT&T, and Tandem.

Taken together, the 64-bit Alpha technology, 64-bit Digital
UNIX, and 64-bit databases such as Oracle7 enable the
breakthrough performance and price/performance of VLM64.
Digital is unique in the industry in its ability to deliver
this capability to customers today.

Applications such as data warehousing, financial management,
and online transaction processing take particular advantage
of VLM64 solutions. This is because more than 4 billion times
more data can be stored in memory than even the most powerful
mainframe systems, at a fraction of the cost. This provides
dramatic improvements in processing speed, application
performance, and system affordability.

Digital's Venturis PCs

Digital Venturis is Digital's value-oriented desktop PC family
designed to meet the computing requirements of general
business users in standard office applications, as well as
those of users in a client/server environment. Ideal for the
volume purchaser, Venturis systems are simple to install, easy
to use and easy to maintain, while providing room to expand as
computing needs evolve.

ALISA SYSTEMS SOLVES COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS
BETWEEN MAINFRAME AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS
FOR WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

The Bridge Design Office in the Washington State Department of
Transportation had a serious E-Mail problem. Three
incompatible electronic mail systems were being used in the
department which made inter-sectional communication difficult.

"We had installed a VAX-based system in our Bridge Design
Office, but NetWare and AppleTalk systems were being installed
in the rest of the department," recalled Dick Stoddard of the
Department of Transportation. "We used VMS Mail internally and
didn't worry about talking to other offices because phone and
conventional mail was the normal way of doing business,"
Stoddard said.

Stoddard, who works in the office that is responsible for
design calculations and "putting out bridge plans", was
becoming increasingly concerned about the E-Mail compatibility
problem because the department was changing the way it did
business. Department E-mail was becoming a critical tool for
administrators and designers. "We just had no integration tool
between VMS Mail and other department mail systems," said
Stoddard. The Bridge Design Office needed to integrate their
VMS mail system with the Microsoft Mail being used on
AppleTalk and NetWare networks without spending a huge sum of
money to install a unified mail system. Luckily for them, they
found Alisa Systems.

Alisa Systems was referred to the Department by several
different companies as an expert in electronic mail
integration. Alisa's AlisaMail software is designed to work
with all of the major mail systems in use today and can be
installed as a central post office.

Alisa sent in a systems engineer who set up the program and
the result was better communication between the Bridge Design
Office and the rest of the department.

"I think it does a very good translation and connection," said
Stoddard. "The connection into the Apple side was almost
transparent. If there's any VMS users out there that need to
communicate with NetWare and MicroSoft Mail, the connections
work very well." Stoddard added, adding, "It's great when an
entire department gets plugged into compatible mail systems."

Alisa Systems was able to provide the Department of
Transportation with a small, cost-effective solution that
allowed their systems to be compatible. The AlisaMail software
was not the only aspect of Alisa Systems that Stoddard was
pleased with. "Their technical staff and their support was
very prompt," he said.

For more information, call Alisa Systems at (800)628-3274.

VAX AND RISC-6000 NOW COMMUNICATE WITH PERSONAL
COMPUTER E-MAIL SYSTEMS AT CARPET MANUFACTURER

Manufacturing depends on the right machinery to get the job
done, but the "machinery" may not always be the kind that
actually makes the product. In addition to manufacturing
hardware, production relies heavily on communication for the
product to get out the door on time.

Shaw Industries, in Dalton Georgia, the world's largest carpet
manufacturer, was having a difficult time keeping up with its
production schedule because departments housed in separate
buildings couldn't communicate. The departments weren't
ignoring each other; their computers were speaking different
languages. Instead of instantaneous E-mail, Shaw was
inefficiently "snail mailing" messages between departments on
foot. The disadvantages were obvious.

"Our company is international, having branches in Great
Britain, Mexico and Australia and also working with outside
vendors and outside clients," said Martha Roberts, a Technical
Specialist for the company. "We have many internal
E-mail systems including ccMail and MicroSoft Mail.  We also
have a large 34-node DEC VAX system and an IBM RISC-6000
computer, each with more E-mail users," she continued.  All
these systems needed to be able to E-mail back and forth
between users corporate-wide. Manufacturing needed to send
production reports and other information to distribution and
we didn't have the local infrastructure in place to where you
could do that easily," Roberts recalled.

Rather than making a huge investment in a single compatible
computer system, Shaw contacted Alisa Systems of Pasadena,
Calif. Alisa brought its technical support engineer on-site
and integrated the company's computers in record time.

"We were up and running in three days," said Roberts, adding,
"I have 2200 AlisaMail users here and corporate-wide. I'd say,
overall, we've got 40,000 users. Reporting time has been
dramatically reduced because it's been automated through the
AlisaMail system," Roberts added. Shaw Industries has also
been extremely pleased with Alisa's technical support staff.
"They're always there when we need them and the training
classes were great," Roberts said enthusiastically.

Needless to say, with AlisaMail, departments at Shaw
Industries are talking to each other again and production is
back on schedule.

HIGH-DENSITY CD-ROM

3M ANNOUNCES DUAL-LAYER CONSTRUCTION PROCESS FOR

LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- November 14, 1994 -- 3M announced today at the
COMDEX show an advanced disc construction allowing the capacity
of high density CD-ROM discs to be doubled for play-back in next
generation CD-ROM drives.

Developed in cooperation with Philips and Sony, 3M's new disc
construction employs a second information layer to double the
capacity of the new high-density CD system under development. The
result is a ten-fold increase in capacity over today's CD-ROM
discs, or more than 6 Gigabytes of information on a single-sided
disc.

"By forming two separate information layers in a single, solid
substrate, there is no need for bonding agents to adhere multiple
platters together with air gaps between which might collect dust
particles," said Rusty Rosenberger, business development manager,
3M Software Media and CD-ROM Services. "3M's new dual-layer
process essentially provides the benefits of blue laser
technology today by doubling the capacity of the new high-density
CD-ROM disc, which is based on red laser technology," he
explained.

This new CD technology is ideally suited for the distribution of
large database and graphic image files such as medical and legal
reference databases, radiography images, digital photography, and
engineering drawing worksets. In the consumer markets, this
technology provides increased content storage and presentation
capabilities to developers of multimedia titles.

"DOING BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET"
SUBJECT OF CONFERENCE BOARD MEETING

Although technologies are making electronic commerce possible,
senior executives are discovering that getting their companies
on-line is only the beginning once the technology is in place,
upper management has final responsibility for strategy and
tactics in dealing with the practical side of doing business
on the Internet, the fastest growing now commercial territory.

Addressing this reality, The Conference Board and the U.S.
Department of Commerce have scheduled a second-generation
conference about commerce on the Internet, focusing on issues
that transcend technology. The two-day conference, which will be held
February 6-7 at the Now York Hilton & Towers, is being
presented with assistance from IBM, GE Information Services
and Arthur D. Little, Inc.

For further information, call The Conference Board at (212)339-0232.

JONES DIGITAL STORE OFFERS ON-LINE
SHOPPING, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION

Denver-Based Dixon Paper Stores Market
to the Home Office On-Line

Internet browsers looking to wrangle great bargains on
interesting products and services, register for an education
course, or enter a fun contest can now gallop over to the
Jones Digital Store, a World Wide Page which uses western-
style graphics. The service has been launched by Jones Digital
Century, an Englewood, Colo.-based electronic publishing
company.

The Jones Digital Store Web Page offers several trails to
follow including Merchants: store locations; Orders, which
takes the user directly to each store's order form; More Info,
information on how to become a Jones Digital Store vendor;
Trail Mix, a list of reciprocal web links; Fun and Games, a
chance for users to enter contests; Comments, an area to ask
questions and leave comments about the service; and What's
New, for new product entries.

At http://wwwjii.com/jds/dixon, Dixon Paper Store offers 170
of its most popular laser paper products.

"We have 11 retail outlets throughout the western United
States, but going on-line will give us the opportunity to
reach the burgeoning home office market on a national levee,"
said Cynthia Scaggs, Dixons Marketing Manager for Retail
Operations. "Customers with questions can enter information
through our storefront to receive an immediate callback from a
Dixon Paper Store representative."

Currently, customers purchase items from the Jones Digital
Store through order forms on the Home Page which prompt a
return phone call from the vendor. A new secured service
allows customers to place items into a virtual shopping basket
and enter their credit card account for payment.

Dr. Bernard Luskin, president of Jones Digital Century, said
"Jones Digital Store is a key element of our long-term
business strategy to provide education, entertainment and
information services via electronic means."

Jones Digital Century develops digital publishing and
interactive multimedia projects, television series and
documentaries, productivity software and on-line services. The
company published "Charlton Heston's Voyage Through the Bible"
on CD-ROM and will issue "The Jones Multimedia Encyclopedia"
in 1996.

Jones Digital Century is an affiliate of Jones Intercable,
Inc., one of the nations ten largest cable television
operating companies; Mind Extension University, the only 24-
hour cable network dedicated to distance education and
professional training; and Jones Computer Network, the first
24-hour cable network devoted to computers and emerging
technologies.

Netscape and Sun Release JavaScript

Netscape Communications Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc.
have released JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object
scripting language for the creation and customization of
applications on enterprise networks and the Internet.  A
complement to Java -- Sun's object-oriented, cross-platform
programming language -- JavaScript is available in its initial
form as part of the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which
may be downloaded from Netscape's Web site.

The draft specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft
specification of Java, will be published and submitted to
appropriate standards bodies for industry review and comment this
month.  Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3
Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
as an open Internet scripting language standard.

Twenty-eight companies -- America Online Inc., Apple Computer
Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&T, Borland
International, Brio Technology Inc., Computer Associates Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett- Packard Company, Iconovex
Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies Inc., Informix
Software Inc., Intuit Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks Inc., Novell
Inc., Oracle Corporation, Paper Software Inc., Precept Software
Inc., RAD Technologies Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.,
Silicon Graphics Inc., Spider Technologies, Sybase Inc., Toshiba
Corporation, Verity Inc., and Vermeer Technologies Inc.  -- have
agreed to adopt JavaScript as an open standard object scripting
language and have stated their intentions to provide it in future
products.

Complementary to and integrated with both Java and HTML,
JavaScript is designed specifically for the Internet and network-
centric applications.  It is designed to be used by people with
little or no programming experience to quickly construct complex
applications.  While Java is used by programmers to create new
objects and applets, JavaScript is designed to allow HTML page
authors and enterprise application developers to create live
online applications that link objects and resources on both
clients and servers.

Java "was designed from the ground up for the Internet," said
Bill Joy (vice president of research, Sun).  "JavaScript is a
natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and
Unicode-based worldwide use.  JavaScript will be the most
effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets."

Netscape will support Java and JavaScript in client and server
products, as well as in programming tools and applications.  The
company is building Java and JavaScript support into all Netscape
products to provide a unified, front-to-back, client/server/tool
environment for building and deploying live online applications.
Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit
JavaScript scripts; Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs
to be installed, run, and managed on Netscape servers; and
Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for JavaScript connectivity to
high-performance relational data bases from Illustra, Informix,
Microsoft, Oracle, and Sybase.

Java, the Java Compiler, and the Java Developer's Kit, as well as
the HotJava browser and related documentation are available free
of charge from Sun's Web site at http://java.sun.com.  In
addition, the Java source code can be licensed for a fee.
Existing Sun Java licensees will receive a license to JavaScript.
Moreover, Sun and Netscape intend to make a source code reference
implementation of JavaScript available for royalty-free
licensing, further encouraging its adoption as a standard in a
wide variety of products.

To date, Sun has licensed Java to a number of companies,
including IBM Corporation, Borland, Macromedia, Mitsubishi,
Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, Toshiba, and Microsoft
Corporation (see related story ).

IBM plans to implement the Java technology in products such as
Web browsers and Web servers.  In addition, IBM intends to port
the Java technology to its OS/2 and AIX operating systems, as
well as Microsoft's Windows 3.1.  IBM will make those ports
available over the World Wide Web so users can begin to work with
Java on these platforms starting in the first quarter of 1996
(Sun, 2550 Garcia Avenue, Mountain View CA 94043-1100, 415/336-
5337; Netscape, 501 East Middlefield Road, Mountain View CA
94014, 415/254-1900, fax 415/528-4124).

Microsoft Reveals Internet Strategy, Jumps on Java Bandwagon

7 December -- At a day-long press briefing in Seattle,
Washington, Microsoft Corporation outlined a broad set of
Internet strategies and products designed to propel the software
giant to the forefront of the exploding Internet industry.  In
the most dramatic announcement of the day, Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates not only endorsed Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java
programming language, but revealed that Microsoft has licensed
the rival technology for use in its operating systems, software
programs, and Internet tools.

Acknowledging the "importance of embracing the industry's love of
Java," Microsoft's Internet strategy involves a shift away from
proprietary standards and a nod toward the overwhelming support
of Java as an emerging Internet standard.  A report in The Wall
Street Journal called Microsoft's move a "key gesture, since Java
had become a rallying cry for Internet competitors aligned
against [Microsoft]."  The Java licensing deal was reached just
ten hours before the Microsoft press briefing was scheduled to
begin.

Microsoft said it plans to include the technology in its Internet
Explorer browser, to be offered in 1996 as part of a free add-on
product for users of the Windows 95 and Windows NT operating
systems.  Under the licensing agreement with Sun Microsystems,
Microsoft will make sure that Java works well with its two
operating systems and then will submit the altered code to Sun.
At that point, either Sun or Microsoft may license the Java code
to third parties.

In addition to the Java announcement, Gates also said that
Microsoft will accelerate its repositioning of the Microsoft
Network (MSN) subscription service as an Internet gateway --
offering much of its content free of charge over the Internet or
at a discount to MSN members.

Gates also discussed Microsoft's new interactive 3D multimedia
animation technology for the Internet, ActiveVRML.  Optimized for
authoring and playback on personal computers, ActiveVRML allows
content authors to create three dimensional effects on Web pages.
The technology is being offered as an open industry specification
and has been submitted as a proposal to VRML industry working
groups.

In addition, the company has signed a host of cross-agreements
with companies that include Computer Associates, Oracle, and
Spyglass.  The Microsoft-Spyglass deal calls for Spyglass to
enhance its popular Web browser Mosaic with support for OLE
(object linking and embedding) Controls, Visual Basic Script, and
the latest HTML extensions.  It also will include support for
several new Microsoft server technologies.

Also making its debut at the press briefing was Visual Basic
Script, an Internet scripting language Microsoft will offer over
the Internet at no cost.  The OLE-based Visual Basic Script will
allow developers to link and automate elements among Web pages --
not unlike what may be accomplished with Java and the
complementary JavaScript languages (Microsoft, One Microsoft Way,
Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-8080).

Online Christmas

By ROCKLEY L. MILLER
EDITOR AND PUBLISHER

The early results are in, and it seems to have been an "Online
Christmas."  While many retailers reported weak sales in most
gift categories, multimedia computers and high-speed modems were
on a roll, with Dataquest projecting a 46 percent increase in
1995 modem sales to 17.8 million units and IntelliQuest claiming
that nearly 90 percent of new computers are being sold with
installed modems -- up from 70 percent last year.  Also selling
big were books having anything to do with the Internet and
software for getting connected.

The pace of people moving online is matched by the migration of
multimedia capability to the World Wide Web.  New browsers and
home page development tools abound.  The Hot Java programming
language from Sun Microsystems allows programmers to create small
cross-platform applications or "applets" that can include
multimedia and interactive elements, can be transported easily
over the Internet, and can be swapped in and out of user's
computers on an as needed basis.  These specialized self-
contained programs gain value from their small size and targeted,
purpose-specific functionality and ability to interact with other
Java-based programs to perform intelligent tasks such as updating
personalized stock prices or weather reports.

The Java language is being embraced by many of the major Internet
players including Netscape and Microsoft and will allow anyone to
create and upload Java applets as building blocks for others to
use in assembling larger Java applications.

Low-cost hardware devices for Internet access are about to arrive
from Philips (as a CD-i variation) and from Bandai (in the newly
configured Pippin, based on Apple's Power PC chip and operating
system).  Right on their heels are IBM and Oracle, each promising
to develop powerful $500 network terminals that will provide
dedicated communications capabilities and run Java-style software
applets.

For most users, however, the online experience remains a
frustrating series of "clicks and waits" as large graphic files
load slowly via even the fastest 28.8 Kbps conventional modems --
taking more than a minute for a simple two megabit image.  Even
those who step up to ISDN 58 Kbps service will be twiddling their
thumbs for over 30 seconds.  Start downloading video and
animations, and the wait can easily become hours or days.

Thus, I predict that the "giant sucking sound" we hear in 1996,
won't be Ross Perot's jobs heading south of the border, but
consumers sucking up high-speed cable modems as fast as the cable
companies can process the orders.  Offering 4 Mbps data rates, a
cable modem will pop that same two megabit image up on your
screen in half a second.  Large file transfers become viable, as
minutes become seconds and hours become barely minutes.  Cable
companies already have ordered more than 500,000 of the devices
for distribution beginning in early 1996.  Given the patience
level of the typical American consumer, and given a competitively
low monthly cost for both modem leasing and service access, these
devices promise to totally transform the online landscape in the
coming new year.  q

Note:  This is not a joke.  In the Christmas rush, we received an
interesting letter, dated 30 December, from Keith Barland at the
Microsoft corporate library.  It seems that Microsoft has
developed a whole new perspective on copyright protection and
site licensing that might contain good news for users of its
software.

The letter humbly requests permission to reproduce articles from
Multimedia Monitor "obtained from any source and in any format,
whether print or electronic, for distribution solely to employees
of Microsoft for internal use only."  This permission was to be
granted without additional payment and without any other
limitations.  The clincher was the last sentence, which read, "If
we do not hear from you we will assume your approval of this
agreement."

Might I humbly suggest that we all issue similar requests to
Microsoft for permission to reproduce its software for internal
use only, without additional payment or any other limitations.
Of course, should Microsoft fail to specifically and directly
deny such a request -- or should their denial become conveniently
lost in the mail -- we can all presume they have approved our
request, and we can save a bundle on corporate-wide software
purchases and site licenses.

Get real, Microsoft.  The request alone is arrogant enough, but
the presumption of a default loss of rights is beyond the pale --
and this from the company that hopes to pave most of the
information highway.  Are information providers like us mere road
kill in the Microsoft vision? Or is Microsoft somehow exempt from
the intellectual property rules that they expect everyone else to
respect?

Microsoft and NBC Enter Cable Television, Online Deal

After weeks of speculation, Microsoft Corporation and NBC have
entered into a joint venture to form MSNBC Cable, a 24-hour cable
television news channel, and MSNBC Online, a complementary
interactive online service.  Under the terms of the agreement,
totaling approximately $420 million, Microsoft will invest $220
million over the next five years for a 50 percent stake in the
cable network.  In addition, NBC will put up $200 million over
five years for its part in funding the cable channel and the
supporting online service.

MSNBC Cable will feature NBC News correspondents, live coverage
of world events, news analysis, and "a multimedia presence on-
screen."  According to Bob Wright (president of NBC), the new
cable service will be launched in late 1996.  Wright said he
expects the new cable service to have between 25-35 million
viewers by the end of 1996, compared to CNN's 67 million viewers.
The MSNBC Online service, accessible through the Microsoft
Network, will leverage content available globally from NBC and
sister service CNBC.  According both parties, NBC will handle all
news gathering for the joint venture, as well as for the
Microsoft Network online service.

Executives with both companies expect that the three services --
NBC News, MSNBC Cable, and MSNBC Online -- will work in concert
to strengthen the other's position through cross-promotion.
Furthermore, the new cable service will extend its reach
internationally through NBC's ownership and interest in NBC Super
Channel in Europe, CNBC in Asia, CNBC in Europe, Canal de
Noticias NBC in Latin America, and the soon-to-be-launched NBC
Asia (Microsoft, One Microsoft Way, Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-

IMA and Blockbuster Both To Release CD-ROM Matching Software

The Interactive Multimedia Association and Blockbuster Video
Corporation separately have released CD-ROM matching software to
aid consumers in pairing CD-ROM software titles with their
personal computer systems.

For its part, the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) has
released the beta version of its CD Match software.  The CD Match
initiative (Monitor 12/95 p7) is an industry-wide campaign to
help consumers better match CD-ROM software titles with their
personal computing systems.  The software runs on a variety of
platforms and creates a printout of a system's capabilities.
Consumers can then take this printout to a local retail outlet
and compare it to the IMA-recommended "Uniform Label" that will
appear on CD-ROM packages to determine if their computer system
will support a particular title's system requirements.  The CD-
Match package labels will not be seen in high quantities until
late second quarter 1996.

The beta version of the CD Match software is available on the
IMA's World Wide Web site (ftp://ftp.ima.org/pub/cdmatch) and
also through Horizons Technology Inc.'s Web site
(http://www.horizons.com/cdmatch).  According to Ken Christie
(vice president of marketing at the IMA), "Getting the various
individual companies in both hardware and software publishing to
agree was not difficult.  The industry had seen a need for CD
Match and the IMA has a working relationship with Software
Publishers Association (SPA) to ensure that the systems
requirement portions are in sync.  SPA is doing a similar thing,
so they are in support of uniform labeling, as we are in support
of uniform packaging."

Meanwhile, Blockbuster Video Corporation, in conjunction with
Windows utility software publisher Touchstone Software
Corporation, rolled out the Blockbuster PC MatchMaker on 4
December 1995 into eight markets.  This utility lists all the CD-
ROM titles available at the retailer and indicates which titles
are compatible with a shopper's computer.  The floppy disk will
sell for $9.99, but will be free to consumers who buy and rent
CD-ROMs at Blockbuster (IMA, Suite 202, 48 Maryland Avenue,
Annapolis MD 21401-8011, 410/626-1380; Blockbuster, PO Box

Intuit Plans Internet Banking Service, Skirts Deal with AOL

Despite signing a strategic agreement with America Online Inc.
just last month to jointly provide electronic banking services to
AOL customers (Monitor 12/95 p5), Intuit Inc.  has announced
plans to introduce an independent Internet-based home banking
service.  The new service will be available to customers by the
second half of 1996.  According to Intuit, customers will be able
to download free software via the Internet to establish a "home
banking link" that will work essentially the same way the
AOL/Intuit banking service will work -- but at no charge to the
user.

Currently, Intuit offers users of its popular Quicken personal
finance software the option to bank online via the company's
private network.  With the new Internet service, customers will
be able to bank online without being required to own Quicken.
Customers will be able to monitor bank accounts, transfer funds
between accounts, and pay bills via the Internet -- with all
transactions protected by an encryption process.  Intuit will
receive a fee from the participating bank for each transaction.
The company said it also intends to offer a similar banking link
for users of Netscape's Navigator browser (Intuit, 155 Linfield
Avenue, PO Box 3014, Menlo Park CA 94026, 415/322-0573).

Jones Launches The Internet Channel in Virginia

Jones International Ltd.  has launched The Internet Channel, a
high-speed Internet gateway service now available to Alexandria,
Virginia cable TV customers who are served by Jones Intercable (a
subsidiary of Jones International).  Through a cable modem
connected to a home PC, customers may access The Internet Channel
to explore a virtual "Old Town" Alexandria, where storefronts
symbolize Internet destinations -- as well as local, regional,
and global merchants.

For example, users can click on a movie theater marquee to access
local showing information and hyperlink to the home pages for
each featured movie title.  Other destinations include:  a
Newsstand that connects users to cover pages of magazines and a
City Hall building that links users to municipal information.
Because cable modems can provide connections that are as much as
100 times faster than telephone modems, "the Internet Channel
will allow its subscribers unlimited usage of the service for a
fixed rate of about a dollar per day," according to Bill Nestel
(president, The Internet Channel).

The Internet Channel, which will operate as a sister company of
Jones International, has entered into an arrangement with LANcity
Corporation, which will supply the cable modems that will be used
in Alexandria.  Eventually, The Internet Channel plans to license
its gateway services to other cable TV systems, in addition to
those operated by Jones (9697 East Mineral Avenue, PO Box 3309,
Englewood CO 80155-3309, 303/792-3111, fax 303/792-5608).

3DO Signs Definitive Agreement with Matsushita, Buys Cyclone
Studios

Six weeks after announcing plans to license its M2 technology to
Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, The 3DO Company has
signed a definitive agreement effecting the $100 million deal
(Monitor 12/95 p5).  Under the agreement, signed on 7 December
1995, Matsushita will pay 3DO a $100 million license fee plus
additional royalties.  3DO will receive $60 million in mid-
December and the remaining $40 million by the middle of 1996.

The agreement gives Matsushita exclusive rights to use the M2
technology to power next-generation consumer and commercial
products (including DVD, set-top boxes, and 64-bit games
machines).  Matsushita also may sub-license the M2 technology to
hardware companies and software developers.  3DO has the rights
to develop products based on the M2 technology for coin-operated
arcade game systems, personal computer applications, general
computing, and software development tools.

Trip Hawkins (CEO, The 3DO Company) said 3DO will use the funds
to diversify.  "We will exploit our core technology to enter the
PC market with software and hardware, the Internet arena, as well
as the 64-bit video game market," he said.

As a part of its diversification efforts, 3DO has entered into an
agreement to acquire the assets of Cyclone Studios, a company
devoted to developing action/arcade-style video games.  The
acquisition is intended to bolster Studio 3DO's ability to
deliver titles on advanced 32-bit, 64-bit, and PC platforms.  3DO
will acquire the assets of Cyclone Studios for a combination of
cash, common stock, and other considerations.  Terms of the
agreement were not disclosed.  Cyclone Studios will operate as an
independent division within Studio 3DO (3DO, 600 Galveston Drive,
Redwood City CA 94063-4746, 415/261-2792; Matsushita, 1006

Group of Nine Agree On DVD Format Name and Specifications

The core group of nine digital videodisc (DVD) development
companies -- Sony Corporation, Philips Electronics NV, Toshiba
Corporation, Time Warner Inc., Matsushita Electrical Industrial
Company, Pioneer Electronic Corporation, JVC, Hitachi Ltd., and
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (reportedly, Thomson Multimedia
of France will become the tenth member of the group) -- have
formally adopted "Digital Versatile Disc," or "DVD" for short, as
the official name of forthcoming high-density CD format.

The group also reached an agreement on the basic technical
specifications for DVD hardware media.  The discs will be 120 mm,
or five inches, in diameter and 1.2 mm thick with 4.7 GB of
memory per side (allowing 133 minutes of video per side).  The
format also will be backwards compatible with existing compact
disc technology, meaning that it will run current CD music discs,
as well as CD-ROM storage and game discs.

For video storage, MPEG-2 (Motion Picture Experts Group type 2)
video compression will be the standard.  For audio, Dolby AC-3
will be used.  The discs will be able to carry a maximum of eight
sound channels and 32 subtitle data channels alongside each
movie.  For computer data storage applications, the group agreed
to use the Micro UDF or ISO-9660 file management structure.
Specifications for music applications will be completed after the
group hears opinions from music industry representatives.

The group reported that the first DVD players are expected to go
on sale in late 1996 or early 1997 and are expected to retail in
the $500 to $600 range.  These early machines will not be able to
record until copyright issues are resolved.

In related news, Toshiba Corporation proposed to the companies
involved in the DVD development that a joint company be
established to centralize management of royalty contracts and
revenues.  The purpose of the joint company will be to avoid any
doubling of royalty charges or unnecessary increases in license
fees for users of the technologies.  Sources within Toshiba
report that a company will be established by the end of January
(Sony, 9 West 57th Street, New York NY 10019, 212/371-5800;

Pioneer Drops LaserActive

Pioneer Consumer Electronics is quietly closing out its
LaserActive interactive videodisc system, with players now
selling for around $299.  According to David McCollough (AV brand
manager at Pioneer), the company intends to sell through its
remaining LaserActive inventory by early 1996.  A Sega module
will be packaged with each player.  The LaserActive system --
which combines a videodisc/CD combi-player with optional control
packs developed in cooperation with Sega and NEC -- was launched
in 1993 in an attempt to appeal to the upscale interactive
entertainment consumer.

McCollough said, "In the game industry, a lot of people make the
money on the software, not on the hardware.  We were trying to
making some profit on the hardware side, as well as the software
side, which is not how that industry is structured."  He added
that, "LaserActive suffered from software developers' reluctance
to invest in authoring tools needed to create games for the
system."  According to McCollough, Pioneer is still dedicated to
the videodisc format.  Current plans for the company call for a
shift in focus towards the entertainment and home theater aspect
of videodisc by adding such features to standard videodisc
players (Pioneer, 600 East Crescent Avenue, Upper Saddle River NJ
07450, 201/327-6400).

Quark Brings Desktop Publishing Online

Envisioning a leap into the next generation of online publishing,
Quark Inc.  has developed QuarkImmedia -- a multimedia software
program that will allow users of the company's popular
QuarkXPress desktop publishing system to package material for the
Internet and the World Wide Web.

QuarkImmedia consists of two components -- an authoring tool,
which builds on QuarkXPress, and a viewer.  The viewer will be
available for downloading, free of charge, via the Internet once
QuarkImmedia is released in the first half of 1996.  Prior to its
final release, QuarkImmedia will be distributed to 300 customers
at Quark's Vail customer conference (12-15 December) for the
purpose of "test driving" the program.  Feedback from the test
group will help determine the look and feel of the final product
(Quark, 1800 Grant Street, Denver CO 80203, 303/894-8888).

SoftKey Works Deal with Tribune, Woos TLC Away from Broderbund

On 30 November, SoftKey International Inc.  entered into a
definitive agreement with Tribune Company to purchase two Tribune
subsidiaries -- Compton's NewMedia Inc.  and Compton's Learning
Company -- in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at $106.5
million.  SoftKey also has agreed to assume up to $17 million of
intercompany debt in connection with the acquisition.

"By combining Compton's NewMedia with SoftKey, we can reach
millions of new homes that were previously untapped.  We view the
SoftKey investment as a part of our commitment to the future of
the consumer marketing business," said Robert Bosau (executive
vice president, Tribune New Media/Education).

In a related deal, Tribune Company agreed to make a $150 million
strategic investment in SoftKey in the event that SoftKey
acquires a majority of the common stock of The Learning Company
(TLC).  Tribune's investment would be in the form of 5.50 percent
convertible/exchangeable notes from SoftKey (due in the year
2000).  The notes will be convertible into SoftKey common stock
at a conversion price of $53 per share.

Within a week, TLC signed a definitive merger agreement with
SoftKey International Inc., terminating its earlier merger
agreement with Broderbund Software Inc.  (Monitor 9/95 p12).
Under the terms of the 7 December agreement, SoftKey's wholly-
owned subsidiary, Kidsco Inc., will offer to purchase
approximately 8.28 million shares of TLC for $67.50 per share in
cash.  These shares represent all TLC shares outstanding,
including vested stock options, as of 6 December 1995.
Approximately 1.1 million unvested TLC options will be converted
into SoftKey options, a transaction valued at about $606 million.

Commenting on his company's decision to terminate its Broderbund
merger agreement and to pursue the SoftKey deal, Bill Dinsmore
(president and CEO, The Learning Company) said, "Our board of
directors unanimously concluded that the revised SoftKey merger
terms are clearly in the best interests of the... stockholders."

Broderbund -- which had filed a lawsuit against SoftKey alleging
"questionable business and accounting practices" -- has agreed to
withdraw all litigation related to TLC, SoftKey, and Tribune
Company (SoftKey, 1 Athenaeum Street, Cambridge MA 02142,
617/494-1200; Tribune, 435 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago IL

DataMark Media, Katz Offer Free Online Shopping Service

Direct marketing services firm DataMark Systems Inc.  and Katz
Media Group have unveiled plans for an advertiser-supported
online direct marketing service called ValuOne Online.

The free service -- designed to drive purchase decisions in
retail and catalog channels -- helps consumers easily find and
select information about a broad range of products and services.
ValuOne Online offers consumers the ability to preview products
and promotions before making a purchase; gives them a direct
connection to catalog marketers; and includes a "coupon clipping"
feature that gives lets users print out coupons for their
favorite products for redemption at their local supermarket.

"ValuOne Online takes advantage of how consumers really prefer to
use online services:  as a resource before buying rather than as
a place to actually make purchases," said Chad Evans (chief
executive officer of DataMark Systems).  Evans noted that
according to a recent Advertising Age study, 60 percent of
respondents said they were interested in interactive services
that allow them to research products before purchasing.

DataMark Systems used a proprietary consumer profiling technology
to "hand-pick" four million online consumers who will be the
first to experience ValuOne Online.  DataMark Systems will
distribute ValuOne Online diskettes to these qualified users.
The service is scheduled to launch in the first half of 1996.

Katz Media Group will sell advertising space on the service.
Advertisers can display or promote products through a number of
advertising options, including Power Display "prime" display
space; Prime Marquees; Sponsor Marquees; time-sensitive
promotions for limited time opportunities,; and coupons for users
to view and print for redemption.  In addition, ValuOne Online's
Admaker function allows marketers 24-hour access to their ads, so
they can change any part of their promotional offer almost
instantaneously (DataMark Media, Suite 220, 348 East Winchester,
Salt Lake City UT 84107, 801/268-2202).

Computer Associates Offers Secure Internet Solution

Computer Associates (CA) has introduced CA-Unicenter/ICE
(Internet Commerce Enabled), a technology for securing and
managing electronic commerce.  Available stand-alone or
integrated with Netscape Web server software, CA-Unicenter/ICE
provides security, event management, help-desk, storage
management, resource accounting, Intranet or enterprise
capabilities, and data-base monitoring -- effectively "bullet-
proofing the 'Net," according to CA.

(CA chairman and CEO) Charles Wang noted, "As organizations move
to transact commerce over the Internet, they are demanding
tighter controls over the infrastructure... The Internet will
only realize its full commercial potential when it becomes as
manageable and secure as corporate computing environments."

CA-Unicenter/ICE allows server managers to secure, monitor, and
track Web users.  It features enhancements such as TCP/IP port
security and automated capture and auditing of security
violations.  To improve Web reliability and availability, CA-
Unicenter/ICE monitors HTTP servers for errors and exceptional
events.  CA-Unicenter/ICE manages reduces storage requirements by
offloading non-critical files when the server becomes full.  An
intelligent restore capability automatically brings back a file
when access is attempted.  The technology also supports automated
backup and recovery of data for disaster recovery.

CA-Unicenter/ICE provides automatic workload scheduling, as well
as software distribution to simplify system management.  For
Intranet customers, CA-Unicenter/ICE ensures reliable and secure
service; manages the client configuration in a central data base;
and provides complete auditing and reporting of data access,
attempted security breaches, and security policy modifications

Dimension X Offers Web Users a "Liquid Reality"

Dimension X has released Liquid Reality, which fully integrates
the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) into a Java-based
browser to transform static VRML objects into realistic
characters with lifelike responses and behaviors using motion and
audio.

According to Dimension X CEO Karl Jacob, Liquid Reality turns
existing three-dimensional VRML sites into "interactive Web
movies.  Right now, VRML worlds are lifeless and static places.
Liquid Reality enables us to create environments which mimic the
world around us, full of motion, sound, and interaction," he
said.

Liquid Reality lets users customize VRML Web sites that can then
be viewed and shared by other Liquid Reality users.  A Web site
can be developed to automatically trigger responses based on the
location of the user within the site, or they can be developed so
that the users must select objects to activate the responses.

Liquid Reality is available for licensing to commercial users and
is accessible to anyone that wishes to download it for non-
commercial use.  To download, visit the Dimension X site at
http://www.dimensionx.com/ (111 East Lime Avenue, Monrovia CA
91016-2839, 818/359-8989).

Kodak Unveils Photo CD Technology for World Wide Web

Eastman Kodak Company and the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) have released a technology that allows World
Wide Web users to zoom in and examine small details of Photo CD
images transmitted over the Internet.  To experience the
technology firsthand, online users may access the NCSA Web site
(http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/HomePage.html)
and download special Photo CD-Aware NCSA Mosaic 2.1 for Windows
software.  Web users can, for example, zoom in and read tail
numbers of historic planes featured on the Smithsonian's National
Air and Space Museum Web site.

The current enabling technology is available to users of NCSA's
Mosaic browser software on the Windows 3.1, Windows for
WorkGroups, Windows 95, and Windows NT platforms.  To discourage
unauthorized use of copyrighted images, Kodak also is developing
technology that will limit access to higher-resolution Photo CD
data and which will allow providers to watermark their images
with identifying words or graphics (Kodak, 343 State Street,
Rochester NY 14650, 716/724-4000).

OSTA Establishes Interchange Standard

The Optical Storage Technology Association (OSTA), a trade
association representing optical product manufacturers, has
established the Universal Disk Format (UDF), a single-file system
interchange standard for computer applications.

The UDF, developed by OSTA to make optical storage solutions
independent of the data or operating system, will work with the
International Standards Organization interchange standard for
non-sequential recording of data, called ISO 13346.  The aim of
the UDF "is to facilitate data interchange independent of
hardware, software, and operating system," said Isaac van Kempen,
senior product line manager at Fujitsu America Inc.  and chairman
of the OSTA Technical Committee.

OSTA said it will develop a new specification based on its UDF
that will provide a standard file system for digital videodisc
(DVD) to ensure playback compatibility between DVD players and
computer-based systems supporting the OSTA compliant portion of
the ISO 13346 file system.

According to a report in the Electronic Buyers' News, the
specification to be developed will extend data interchange to
include the consumer environment, will separate hardware from
content, and will create compatible file systems for both
entertainment and computer-based content.  The UDF format will
then support read-only, write once, and rewritable applications,
as well as combinations of those applications.

Philips Develops CD-R and Erasable Chip for SCSI and ATAPI
Interfaces

Philips Semiconductors has developed a highly integrated CD-R/E
chip with a choice of external SCSI or ATAPI interfaces.  The
SAA7390 also condenses sophisticated functions from four
integrated circuits (ICs) into one to reduce both board area and
costs.

The SAA7390 contains all of the logic required to connect
decoders to a host.  The IC is capable of 6X read and 4X write
with a maximum burst data transfer rate of 16.9 MB per second
into the external interface IC.  The SAA7390 includes third level
error encoding and decoding in hardware and an easy-to-use memory
management system with ten levels of arbitration.  Philips offers
the chip with a choice of SCSI or ATAPI interface capability with
high level of integration.

be available in January 1996.  In early 1996, CD-ROM developers
will be able to purchase total systems software from Philips
Semiconductors that will be fully tested for compatibility and
functionality.  The total systems packages are expected to reduce
the drive development time by about eight months (811 East Arques
Avenue, PO Box 3409, Sunnyvale CA 94088-3409, 408/991-2000).

Speech Systems Unveils PCMCIA-Based Speech Recognition System

Speech Systems Inc.  has unveiled the Phonetic Engine 1000
(PE1000), a PCMCIA card that enables mobile, Windows-based
computers to run speech-driven applications using Speech Systems'
continuous speech, speaker-independent speech recognition
technology.

Based on a Multimedia PC Card from DSP Solutions Inc., the PE1000
is a Type II Extended PC card that integrates a Texas Instruments
TMS320C50 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for highly accurate
speech recognition in real-time.  The PE1000 PC Card receives
incoming speech through a microphone, and the DSP converts it to
speaker-independent phonetic codes that are used for recognizing
speech.  The PE1000 card features two jacks for speech
recognition -- one for voice input, the other for audio output --
allowing card to serve as a single source for sound and CD-ROM
playback.

Speech Systems also plans to offer an OEM version of the PE1000
PC Card, which can be embedded in mobile data terminals such as
belt units or hand-held computing devices with the ability to
process speech input and send it to a host computer.

Scheduled to begin shipping in the fourth quarter of 1995, the
PE1000 will be available as a Run-time System (RTS) that includes
the PE1000 PC Card, RTS software, and a noise-canceling
microphone ($595).  Speech Systems' VoiceMatch SDK software is
$595.  A bundled development system that includes a PE1000 RTS
and VoiceMatch is available for $995.  SpeechWizard software,
also for use with the RTS, is an additional $295 (Speech Systems,
2945 Center Green Court South, Boulder CO 80301-2275, 303/938-

IMA Joins in Launch of EC-Funded Intellectual Property Consortium

The Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) has joined in the
launch of IMPRIMATUR, an international consortium funded by the
European Commission (EC) and announced at the European
Information Technology Conference in Brussels on 29 November.
The goal of IMPRIMATUR is to develop international consensus on
practices for managing intellectual property to support
"electronic commerce for content" -- making intellectual property
accessible, yet secure.  While a number of proprietary solutions
exist for such information management, there are as yet no
agreed-on specifications that allow different systems to
interoperate.

IMPRIMATUR's 15 members include ALCS, Bertelsmann AG, the British
Library, CISAC, CliPet Communications, Digicash, EUSIDIC,
Florence University, IFPI, ILC Ltd, Imperial College, Teles GmbH,
Telia AB, Thomson Multimedia, and, now, the Interactive
Multimedia Association.  The Authors Licensing and Collecting
Society (ALCS) in the United Kingdom is the coordinator of the
Consortium.

Unlike other members of the consortium, the IMA will not receive
funding from the European Commission.  Instead, the IMA will
commit itself to providing a link between the other members of
IMPRIMATUR and US industry (IMA, Evan Shubin, Suite 202, 48

Pac Bell Moves Into Wireless TV

Pacific Bell plans to acquire, for approximately $175 million,
all of the stock of Wireless Holdings Inc.  (WHI) and Videotron
Bay Area Inc.  (VBAI) -- giving Pacific Bell access into cable
television markets in California, Florida, South Carolina, and
Washington State.

According to a Newsbytes report, Craig Watts (manager of
corporate communications for Pacific Telesis Group) said, "The
move into wireless TV is our means of competing with the
aggressive moves of Cox Cable and TCI Cable into telephony over
cable.  Our acquisitions to date give us the ability to offer 100
channel television to over seven million homes in California."

The consideration will be payable by delivery of $120 million of
Pacific Telesis common stock and the assumption of approximately
$55 million of debt to Videotron and Transworld.  The transaction
is intended to be tax free to the Transworld shareholders, who
will receive shares of Pacific Telesis common stock in exchange
for their Transworld stock on its liquidation.

Pacific Bell also reported that, through its Pacific Telesis
Video Services unit, it plans to develop content for the cable
operations.  It will also obtain video content from Tele-TV, the
joint venture formed by Pacific Telesis, NYNEX, and Bell Atlantic
(Pacific Telesis Group, 130 Kearny Street, San Francisco CA

Thomson Invests $25 Million in StarSight

Thomson Multimedia has become the second largest owner of
StarSight Telecast Inc., by purchasing 13.25 percent of
StarSight's stock for $25 million, with an option to raise its
investment to 19.5 percent at $42 million.

The move provides working capital for StarSight, a developer of
on-screen TV program guides, which reported a loss of $25.5
million in the first nine months of its fiscal year'.  "The real
story is that we are banking on the success of StarSight and
backing it with our dollars in an aggressive move.  We would like
to see StarSight become the standard," said James Myer (senior
vice president, Thomson Consumer Electronics).  "We... believe
that electronic program guides will become a very important
feature in televisions and VCRs in the future."

Under the agreement, Thomson is expected to ''aggressively
incorporate'' and promote StarSight technology and related
services in selected product lines.  In return, Thomson will be
compensated for its marketing efforts and will share in StarSight
Telecast revenues with respect to StarSight Telecast's consumer
electronics business.  According to StarSight, the two companies
also will establish a marketing fund for joint promotion of
StarSight-capable products.

Other corporate "partners" in StarSight are:  Viacom, which owns
23.4 percent; Cox Broadcasting (8.6 percent); The Tribune Company
(4.5 percent); Providence Journal (3.15 percent); and Time Warner
(3.1 percent) (Thomson, 10330 North Meridian, Indianapolis IN

Multimedia is Disappearing
Fall Comdex 1995

13 - 17 November:  Las Vegas NV
Sponsored by Softbank

By JOHN N. LATTA, Ph.D.
Senior Contributing Editor

Welcome to Comdex.  In a town packed with 200,000 visitors over a
five-day period, patience certainly wears thin.  While the
conference seemed to run more smoothly under new owner Softbank's
guidance, no matter how you describe the event, the bottom line
is that Comdex is a one-of-a-kind -- unpleasant to navigate, yet
essential to attend.

Comdex continues to deliver the best keynotes in the industry.
An outstanding talk was given by Louis Gerstner (Chairman and
CEO, IBM Corporation) which is summarized in this issue.  In
another keynote, Bill Gates (Chairman and CEO, Microsoft)
examined the future of computing with the aid of a video
depicting life in a small town.  In many respects Gates'
presentation was similar to the "Information at Your Fingertips -
- 2000" speech he delivered last year.  However, his emphasis has
shifted to the Internet and how PCs and applications
(Microsoft's, of course) can be seamlessly linked together.
Missing from his presentation was the wallet PC which Gates had
described several times in the past -- including his presentation

3D Comes Out

In the area of 3D chip development, what was a trickle only six
months ago (see Siggraph 95 coverage, Monitor 10/95 p20) has now
turned into a flood.  What follows is a summary of the chip
announcements at Comdex.

Analysis:  The Significance of 3D

o    For consumers, 3D means "fun."  Because real-time 3D
technology allows users to change their viewpoint, it places the
users in control and not subject to the whims of the designer.
This flexibility extends beyond games and is applicable to the
proliferation of consumer programs which permit walk-throughs of
spaces, the design of homes, and 3D visualization.

o    3D brings a new level of visual realism to the PC
experience.  The public has become accustomed to higher levels of
entertainment quality, founded on multimedia, and 3D is the next
logical step.

o    3D is rapidly becoming a mainstream component of software.
Already, home design programs, especially those in 3D, are
selling very well.  Individuals relate to visual realism, easy-
to-use programs, and their ability to control the creation of the
content and participation in it.  With 3D, the PC becomes a
visual computer, even more so than it did with the introduction
of video.

o    PC entertainment software is continually looking for ways to
press the leading edge of the user experience.  3D extends the
range of opportunities for content developers.  q

3D Game and Content Developers

o    Mindscape Inc.  recently released CyberSpeed, the first game
to use Microsoft-owned Rendermorphic's Reality Lab API and a
direct port of the Sony PlayStation game.  Mindscape wanted to
show how well 3D can be accomplished in a software only
application, and the company achieved 25 frames per second in
320x240 mode -- stretched to 640x480.  Kevin Bachus (Manager of
International Development) said, "the improvement in graphics
quality will be a major boost to the game industry." Mindscape's
development strategy, according to Bachus, is to price titles
aggressively (from $19.95 to $29.95) and to stress the
development of fewer titles -- which imparts a sense of quality
to consumers.  This combination will enable Mindscape to set new
levels of sell through -- in the 500,000 to 1,000,000 range per
title (60 Leveroni Court, Novato CA 94949, 415/883-3000, fax
415/883-3303).

o    Velocity chairman and chief technology officer Moses Ma
noted that many market opportunities for 3D software come from
the many bundling deals being offered by the chip and board
companies.  "As with CD-ROM bundling in the early phases of this
market, bundling with 3D will drive most of the installed base,"
according to Ma "Bundling will force the developers to squeeze
every bit of performance from the 3D chips."  At the same time,
he said that an essential component to the success of 3D is the
need for the business 3D equivalent of Lotus 1-2-3.  "There must
be a mainstream 3D application," said Ma.  Unfortunately,
according to Ma, developers are limited by a lack of good 3D
tools (Suite 3100, 4 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco CA 94111,
415/776-8000).

o    Aaron Howard (president and CEO, Media Station) said the
potential for 3D lies in the context of its existing underlying
object-oriented technology.  He said that "3D should be a plug-in
module." Predicting that 3D will reach its potential in 1996 and
beyond, Howard said, "The move to 3D will be incremental." He
expressed some reservations on the potential of Microsoft's
Direct X tools for game development -- not because of the
technology, but because it limits the delivery platform to
Windows 95.  "Media Station has the technology to allow a single
CD-ROM to work on either a PC or Mac," he noted.  "Thus, cross-
platform support is essential."

The Internet, according to Howard, has the potential to increase
the sense of community and experience when used in conjunction
with CD-ROM.  For example, it is possible to add, via the
Internet, other characters to a title.  "Although today's model
for the Internet with Web home pages is a publishing metaphor,"
Howard said, "VRML and Java allow possible extensions to a
virtual world."  However, he warned, creating this new Internet
model will be an evolutionary process.  As with many executives
looking at the Internet, Howard is still examining how the
Internet can be a money-making proposition.  One way might be to
charge a nominal fee to give the user access to a new metaphor,
provide control, and offer value-added features (1140 Eisenhower
Place, Ann Arbor MI 48108, 313/971-1112).

o    Dave Feldman (director of technology at PF Magic) said,
"With 3D acceleration, the PC is finally competitive with home
video game systems; however, the $2,000 price for a PC will
always position it as a high-end, general purpose solution
against the low-price home video game." Feldman said 3D chips
will be used more and more for accelerating the functions in
Microsoft's Reality Lab in order to obtain maximum performance.
The first-generation 3D cards are inadequate, and it will take a
year to get cards which take maximum advantage of Microsoft's
Direct 3D capabilities.

"One of the key issues in the game industry is that the profits
are not there yet.  The attention, budgets, and talent still go
to the feature movie productions," he said (Suite 400, 501 Second
Street, San Francisco CA 94107, 415/495-0400).

o    According to Rob Harris (vice president of technology at
Accolade Inc.), two components are missing in PCs equipped with
3D chips:  3D acceleration and a PC game controller.  When PCs
finally acquire these missing ingredients, they will begin be on
a more level playing field with home video game systems.
"Neither platform will dominate the other, however," he said.

Harris said that Microsoft's Direct X, Direct 3D, and Direct Play
will make the PC more truly "plug and play."  However, the
industry remains in a transition period while Windows 95 gains a
foothold, and titles are developed which make best use of both
the operating systems and the new additions for gaming (5300
Stevens Creek Boulevard, San Jose CA 95129, 408/985-1700).

3D Software Companies

o    Eric Hautemont (president, Ray Dream) predicted a
significant shift in the market to the casual user of 3D.
Originally, Ray Dream positioned its tools for the graphics
professional.  However, with the recently released Ray Dream
Studio, Hautemont expects more than 40 percent of sales will be
to hobbyists -- mostly young males from 15 to 30 who are anxious
to replicate their game experiences enhanced with 3D.

With the addition of animation capabilities, Hautemont's products
will be able to compete with high-end packages such as 3D Studio
MAX, but are much more cost effective and -- at the same time --
provide a tool for the graphics professional and the budding
casual user.  To bolster the position of Ray Dream Studio, the
company supports an open architecture with an open API.  The
program CD-ROM includes a 400-page document on how to write plug-
ins for Ray Dream Studio (1804 North Shoreline Boulevard,
Mountain View CA 94043, 415/960-0768, fax 415/960-1198).

o    Mark Walton (vice president for Marketing and Sales at
3D/Eye Inc.) said that his company's emphasis on intelligent
models and drag-and-drop functionality "will make it possible for
anyone to create 3D content."  Walton said that although the
current chip sets are tuned for the game market, this technology
also will still support the task of making 3D omnipresent in the
workplace.  To do this, 3D/Eye has taken its CAD modeling
experience and included visual, physical, functional, and
behavioral information in the model.

3D/Eye wants to make 3D simple enough to allow it  to be used by
many parts of an organization.  This scope of model
transportability requires a new level of model description and
ease of use -- an objective which 3D/Eye expects to fulfill (1050
Craft Road, Ithaca NY 14850, 607/257-1381).

o    Doug Richard (CEO, Visual Software Inc.) said, "The 3D
accelerator chips will make applications much easier to use."  To
create a large 3D software market, Richard said, models must be
readily available and reusable.  His company's Visual Reality
includes 2 GB of models and textures.

Visual Software is geared to meet the needs of three audiences:
the professional (via Visual Reality 2.0), the enthusiast or
hobbyist (Simply 3D), and the office worker who must create a
presentation (Instant 3D).  "Our strategy requires that we must
have the highest level of tools to gain the broadest market
acceptance," said Richard (21731 Ventura Boulevard, Woodland
Hills CA 91364, 818/883-7900).

o    Another view of the 3D market comes from those with a long
history in it -- the professional animators and those who supply
the software.  One leading company, Side Effects, offers two
programs for the Silicon Graphics family of computers:  PRISMS, a
3D animation system, and Houdini -- a next-generation animation
tool which integrates 2D and 3D.

Greg Hermanovic (principal, Side Effects) said that the high-end
-- that is, SGI -- platforms provide real-time interaction for
the artist.  The introduction of high-performance, 3D chips will
allow professional animators to use lower-cost platforms -- but
for the PC to be effective against the SGI platform, it needs not
only chips, but an operating systems and work station level-
performance.

Hermanovic said that Windows NT could provide the necessary
software, and DEC Alpha systems could provide the hardware.
However, he said, "as long as the SGI platform is superior in
price performance -- even at the $30,000 to $50,000 range, it
will offer the more viable high-end solution."  He predicted that
the market for 3D animation software and hardware will continue
to grow at a rate of 40 percent per year (Suite 1001, 477
Richmond Street West, Toronto ONT MSV 3E7 Canada, 416/504-9876).

3D Home Design

o    3D has already established an important market niche with
home design programs.  Planix, which merged with Softdesk Inc.
in January 1995, is a company that has moved from the high-end
CAD market to the mass market with products such as Planix Home
Architect and Exterior Designer.  Augie Grasis (vice president
for Retail Products, Planix) said he credits the growth of this
market with the fact that "people like 3D -- it's fun.  The
typical home user does not relate well with how a plan will look.
Having 3D visualization brings plans alive."  From a developer's
perspective, Planix is continually faced with the trade-off
between realism and performance.  What the 3D chip allows is a
significant increase in realism.  The Planix software has already
sold 100,000 units.  Grasis predicted a potential market upwards
of 500,000 to 1,000,000 units (Softdesk, 13618 Robin Hill Court,
Houston TX 77059, 713/480-4630).

o    Ken Tarolla (vice president for development, Expert Software
Inc.) reported that his company has already sold one million
copies of its 3D home design programs.  One of the newest
enhancements allows users to produce a layout of the outside of
the house.  Another feature enables the placement of plants and
trees and simulates the growth of this flora over a five to
fifteen year period -- all in a matter of minutes.

Tarolla said the future success of this product category hinges
on the inclusion of texture mapping and built-in links to home
construction products and furnishing companies.  Such links will
allow the home user to realistically see the home before
committing to a design.  Tarolla said he looks forward to 3D
accelerators, "but I cannot have my products dependent on their
penetration."  Growth in capabilities and performance will from
the improvement in processors, he predicted.  Tarolla also
expressed reservations about the potential for VRML and networked
3D.  "I am not sure it will provide the support and quality which
my products need," he said (1443 Franklin Street, Santa Monica CA
90404, 310/828-8719).

3D Networking

o    An early pioneer in networked 3D is Ziff-Davis Interactive,
which announced a interactive virtual reality area, called ZD3D,
on its Web site (http://www.zdnet.com) and in its Microsoft
Network edition (GO ZDNET).  ZD3D is based on software technology
licensed from InterVista.  Tom Aley (product manager) said that
"3D will lower the barriers of entry into the Internet and bring
an element of entertainment."

The Ziff-Davis mission is to support early adopters, and ZD3D is
very much in line with that objective, said Aley.  According to
Aley, the Ziff-Davis Web site is seventh most heavily visited
site in existence, with 350,000 hits per month.  Aley noted that
the impact of the 'Net as an advertising medium are only now
being felt.  "The impact of the 'Net caught many advertisers off
guard," he said, "and, already, ten percent of the media spending
will be shifted to the Internet in 1996 (25 First Street,
Cambridge MA 02154, 617/252-5000).

3D Creative Talent

o    Many producers and suppliers to the industry repeatedly
sited a significant problem present in the industry today:  the
lack of enough 3D animation and content development talent.
According to Bob Stanton of TSC Management Services Group, the
skills most in demand are at the high-end (i.e.  SGI platforms).
Top talent commands salaries of $80,000 to $140,000, plus
royalties and commissions.  "The industry has become so
competitive," according to Stanton, "that the recruiting model is
changing to a talent agency model."  Individuals or firms have
begun to hire firms to represent them in negotiations for
projects or productions.  "The net result," said Stanton, "is
that the price of success continues to escalate, which makes it
more difficult for the small production company to create a
market presence without the help from major publishers or
production companies."

3D Animation and Production

o    Chris Wallace of TOPIX Computer Graphics and Animation
reported that his firm recently opened a division called TOPIX
Interactive, which is specifically focused on creating content
for CD-ROMs and the Internet.  He pointed out that "much of the
3D we see today is of low quality, and this parallels the early
products from the desktop publishing systems."  Thus, he
predicted, the market will gravitate to the professionals (of
which he sees far too few) to create compelling content.

Multimedia in Chips

Comdex was something of a "coming out party" for the first
generation of multimedia chips.  The last several years have seen
an important transformation of the PC industry.  With the home PC
growth rate at 25 percent and household penetration at 33 percent
and climbing, it is no wonder that the home PC market is
increasingly dominating the industry.

Central to the success of the PC in the home is multimedia.
Beginning in 1994 and continuing in 1995, the Pentium processor
has been the processor of choice among consumers.  The Pentium
has fueled the market for better video display and better
multimedia titles.  Yet, the economics of silicon continue to
force increased functionality into fewer and fewer chips.  What
was once supplied on add-in cards will move to the motherboard.
Rumor has it that in 1996, Intel will announce instructions for
the next generation Pentium, the P55C, which will support
multimedia.  An overriding question within the industry is, "Will
Intel make the multimedia instruction set on these machines
open?"

By reducing the technology to silicon, costs can be significantly
decreased and the functionality increased.  The last six months
have seen increasing numbers of multimedia chips announced.  It
will take at least 12 months for these chips to migrate to the
motherboards.  When this migration happens, the quality of
multimedia should again increase (i.e.  the image quality of the
full-motion video playback, along with improved sound and 3D
quality).

o    ATI Technologies Inc.  introduced the ATI-264VT, a full-
featured 64-bit multimedia processor that offers 2D graphics
acceleration, as well as full-screen, full-motion video playback
(including MPEG).  This latest addition to ATI's mach64 family of
products uses a unique video buffer architecture that scales in
both the horizontal and vertical directions, resulting in smooth-
and natural-motion video.  It supports full screen, full-motion
television-quality MPEG or Video CD output.  In addition, the
ATI-264VT was built specifically to enhance game play and has
been designed to take advantage of Microsoft's Windows 95 Game
SDK.  The accelerator contains an integrated 135 MHz RAMDAC and
supports multiple memory types, including FP/EDO DRAM, SDRAM, or
SGRAM.  In production in the first quarter of 1996, it will be
available for $33 in large quantities.

ATI also introduced its Enhanced Visual Architecture (EVA), which
provides a method for multimedia devices to share resources and
exchange video, audio, and graphics data.  The EVA architecture
is supported the ATI-264VT.

ATI also showed the 3D Rage accelerator chip for 3D graphics and
multimedia.  In addition to 3D graphics performance of up to
600,000 Gouraud shaded triangles per second, the accelerator also
provides 2D and video acceleration.  The 3D capabilities include:
perspective corrected bi-linear and tri-linear texture filtering
modes, alpha blending, and fog and texture lighting.  Sporting
broadcast-quality, full-screen, full-motion MPEG video, 3D Rage
offers the easy add-on design of TV tuners, hardware MPEG, and
video conferencing.  Also integrated into the chip is a 135 MHz
DAC with a true 24-bit palette that supports gamma correction.
Priced at $48 for large quantities, full production is slated to
begin in the first quarter of 1996.

Further, ATI introduced Video Xpression, an extendable, 64-bit
multimedia accelerator board designed to bridge the gap between
the PC, television, and game console.  The product features TV-
quality video on a PC and significantly enhanced Windows 95
utilities.  By using the video processor capabilities of the ATI-
264VT, Video Xpression displays full-screen, full-motion TV-
quality video for MPEG and Video CD movie discs on the PC.  It
displays 30 frames-per-second video on all Pentium-class systems.
Video Xpression will be available in January 1996 for $199 (33
Commerce Valley Drive East, Thornhill ONT L3T 7N6 Canada,
905/882-2600, fax 905/882-2620).

o    Avance Logic Inc.  introduced a 64-bit PCI graphics/video
accelerator chipset, combining video acceleration, graphics
functions, and the ability to input live video data streams from
MPEG and TV decoders.  The ALG25128 chipset supports full video
input and output and enables full-screen MPEG playback.  It
includes the company's Video Wizard technology, which is
necessary for MPEG playback, and includes functions for color
space conversion, XY interpolated zoom, and pixel packing.

The scaling technology also has been enhanced to provide 30 fps
full-screen viewing for television signals, MPEG video, and
interactive CD-ROMs.  In addition, the ALG25128 has the ability
to output to either VGA or NTSC/PAL, allowing consumers to output
video to a TV screen.  Application drives will be available for
Xing and Mediamatics MPEG decoders and Indeo, CinePak, and
QuickTime.  The chipset is being offered to OEM customers at less
than $18 for large quantities.  Full-scale production is
scheduled to begin in January 1996 (47509 Seabridge Drive,
Fremont CA 94538, 510/226-9555, fax 510/226-8039).

o    Chromatic Research Inc., together with Toshiba America
Electronic Components Inc.  and LG Semicon Company Ltd.,
presented the Mpact media engine (Monitor 11/95 p7), a multimedia
acceleration chip whose two components -- a single, ultra-high-
bandwidth, highly parallel media processor, and "mediaware"
software modules -- enable seven chip functions:  video, 2D and
3D graphics acceleration, audio, fax/modem, telephony, and
videophone.

The chip includes a PCI interface; Rambus interface; Peripheral
Bus (PBus) interface, Display interface, Video interface, and the
Mpact Mediaware Modules (for JPEG, MEPG-1, MPEP-2, VGA, and GUI
2D Windows acceleration, 3D graphics, audio, fax/modem,
telephony, and video conferencing).  The high bandwidth
capabilities of the Mpact are evident in the Rambus Interface
which will support 500 MB/second burst data transfers.  The PBus
can support up to 14 virtual channels (programmable), which can
include DMA, parallel, and serial interfaces.  The DMA channels
have a total bandwidth of 25 MB/second.

The Mpact will support a wide variety of display resolutions,
from television standards (including NTSC) to computer displays
as large as 1,200x1,600.  The programmable Video interface
supports both the input and output of video in 16-bit YUV format,
and the chip can handle pixel scaling, color space conversion,
and dithering.

Currently the only chip to offer a complete multimedia solution -
- combining VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures for very fast
performance -- the Mpact also makes use of Rambus memory
technology, offering very high bandwidth coupled with reduced
board space and cost (CRI, 800 East Middlefield Road, Mountain
View CA 94043-4030, 415/254-1600; Toshiba, 9775 Toledo Way,
Irvine CA 92718, 714/455-2000, fax 714/453-0125).

o    MicroUnity Inc.  revealed some of the details of its
anticipated MediaProcessor design.  The MediaProcessor
architecture is a revolutionary multimedia and broadband
communications technology based on a mixture of CISC, RISC, and
DSP technologies.  It is expected to run at clock frequencies up
to 1 GHz, which is three times faster than the fastest
microprocessor today.  The MediaProcessor is intended to
eventually supplant today's microprocessors by providing high-
speed networked processing power.  In addition, it can also
implement all conventional multimedia functions, such as 2D and
3D graphics acceleration, video compression and decompression,
and audio synthesis.

MicroUnity plans to start production on the first generation of
MediaProcessors in early 1996.  The key discriminator of
MicroUnity is its focus on broadband signal processing.  Today
these broadband solutions typically are accomplished by using
multiple ASIC chips, a method that certainly can accomplish the
task.  However, MicroUnity purports that such a method results in
fragmented , poorly integrated, inflexible designs.

The MicroUnity solution is based on three components:
MediaBridge, MediaProcessor, and the MediaCodec.  The MediaBridge
connects the MediaChannel to DRAM memories or the PCI bus.  The
MediaCodec is a mixed-signal device which has two broadband RF
transceivers (6-8 MHz channels within a 1 GHz range) and support
for video I/O, stereo audio I/O, telephony, and infrared.  The
critical component of MicroUnity strategy is software which
enables the MediaProcessor to exercise its flexibility.  Integral
to the design of the MediaProcessor is a MediaChannel which
provides multi-Gigabytes per second interfaces between the
processor and outside devices, operating at a peak bandwidth of 4
GB/second.

MicroUnity claims that the MediaProcessor would be very well
suited for 3D processing and image generation.  The company
intends to provide a library of functions which include:  audio
(MPEG, Dolby AC-3); video (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and NTSC encode and
decode); communications (QAM and QPSK modems); Reed-Solomon error
correction; DES encryption; broadband MAC protocols; and network
protocols including Ethernet, MPEG control, and ISDN.

MicroUnity has been described as a high-risk, high-payback
proposition.  The company is understood to have in excess of $100
million in funding.  Although its backers have not been
disclosed, they are widely rumored to include Microsoft,
Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, TCI, US West, and Cray Research (255
Caspian Drive, Sunnyvale CA 94089-1015, 408/734-8100, fax 408-
734-8136).

o    nVidia Corporation displayed its NV1 multimedia accelerator,
which was unveiled earlier in the year (Monitor 10/95 p24).  In
addition to 2D Windows GUI acceleration, the chip also features
photo-realistic 3D graphics capabilities based on nVidia's unique
"curved-surface polygon" rendering techniques, as well as
"lightning fast" texture-mapping.  Based on a second order
quadratic surface description, the NV1 rendering technology
allows for simpler objects and lower memory bandwidth
requirements in the rasterization process.  However, this
modeling approach requires features in tools which are not widely
available today.  The vast majority of 3D content is presently
done using a polygonal approach.

The chip supports wavetable audio synthesis and full-motion video
playback with a sustainable rate of 30 frames per second of true-
color digital video.  The NV1 chip is also the first of its kind
to features a digital game port, which allows a joystick to
directly access the PC's main memory.  The NV1 is priced around
$200 (1226 Tiros Way, Sunnyvale CA 94086, 408-720-6100, fax 408-
720-6111).

o    Philips Semiconductors Inc.  introduced the TriMedia
embedded microprocessor architecture, on which the first product,
the TriMedia-1 will be based.  Consisting of a single
microprocessor, the TriMedia-1 architecture combines the benefits
of VLIW and DSP architectures, resulting in a peak performance of
2.5 billion operations/second operating at 100 MHz.  One goal of
the design was to integrate digital signal processors,
specialized chips (or ASICs), and a general purpose processor
into one chip.

This high-performance design permits mixed multimedia processing
including MPEG-1 decoding at 30 fps with superimposed texture-
mapped 3D graphics.  A 100 MHz TriMedia chip uses only 22 percent
of its processing power to perform MPEG-1 decoding, while the
remaining 78 percent will support 3D at 150,000 polygons/second
with texture mapping, alpha blending, and Z-buffering.

The TriMedia processor contains a programmable CPU core, which
can be programmed and optimized at the C language level.  A full
software development environment is provided, offering
programmers powerful and easy tools for developing software.  The
TM-1 -- the first in a family of TriMedia processors -- is the
core processor with a PCI bus (due for release in mid-1996).  The
TM-VP, a Video Phone Chip, is also due out in 1996.  Another
chip, expected in 1997 or 1998 is the TM-TV the digital TV chip.
(811 East  Arques Avenue, Sunnyvale CA 94088-3409, 800/234-7318,
fax 708/296-8556).

o    Tseng Labs Inc.  unveiled the ET6000, a high-speed graphics
and multimedia engine.  Designed to take advantage of the Windows
95 operating system, the ET6000 offers a 128-bit graphics
accelerator employing the new MDRAM memory architecture by MoSys
Inc.  It also supports Microsoft's DirectDraw API for an advanced
gaming experience.  An internal video processing engine delivers
full-motion, high-resolution video playback and allows the
simultaneous display of up to four digital video windows.  The
chip supports YUV to RGB conversion, color keying, gamma
correction, and 128-bit GUI acceleration.  The ET6000 will handle
playback of software codecs for Indeo, Cinepak, TrueMotion, and
MPEG.  Production is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of
1996 (6 Terry Drive, Newton PA 18940, 215/968-0502, fax 215/860-
7713).

COMDEX, CONTINUED: Other New Products

Windows 95 Update

o    Microsoft Corporation provided a snapshot of the "state of
Windows 95."  As of this writing, more than seven million units
of Windows 95 had been purchased (including OEM and upgrade
sales) and over four million PCs had been sold with Windows 95
preinstalled.

In the first eight weeks of availability, Windows 95 was
purchased and deployed by at least 160 companies worldwide; and
more than half of Microsoft's top 1,000 US corporate accounts
have moved beyond the pilot stage to deploy Windows 95 across
their organizations.  More than 25 percent of software revenue
generated in September 1995 was attributed to products designed
to run on Windows 95; currently, some 700 products are designed
to run on Windows 95.  Finally, according to a survey by Burke
Customer Satisfaction, more than 90 percent of customers in
Europe and the US are satisfied with Windows 95 (One Microsoft
Way, Redmond WA 98052, 206/882-8080).

3D Graphics

o    3D Labs Inc.  introduced Permedia, its second-generation,
low-cost 3D graphics accelerator family, which offers 2D, 3D, and
video acceleration.  The Permedia provides high-performance 3D
acceleration based on 3D Labs' GLINT graphics processors, with up
to 25 million texture-mapped pixels/second, with perspective
correction and full bi-linear filtering.  Other 3D capabilities
include Gouraud shading, optional z-buffering, fogging,
transparency, overlays, and stencils at a rate of up to 500,000
50-pixel triangles/second.  3D Labs will first make the Permedia
chip available to selected OEMs in the first quarter of 1996.
Catering to the home PC market, the resulting multimedia graphics
solutions are expected to be priced at under $250 (Suite 403,

o    3Dfx Interactive Inc.  introduced Voodoo Graphics, a 3D
graphics accelerator targeted at 3D entertainment applications in
both the coin-operated/arcade and home consumer markets.  The
accelerator features several 3D functions including advanced
texture mapping, texture compositing, texture morphing, and
animated textures.  Optimized for real-time 3D generation, Voodoo
Graphics supports perspectively correct polygons with point-
sampled texture mapping, z- and double-buffering, Gouraud
shading, LOD MIP-mapping, and bilinear filtering.  On a typical
Pentium-90 computer system, the resulting performance is more
than 45 megapixel/second fill rate, with over 350,000
triangles/second.

Voodoo Graphics consists of two separate chips:  the pixelfx,
which is the primary graphics controller, and the texelfx, an
advanced texture-processing unit.  The chipset operates under
most PC operating systems and development environments (DOS,
Windows NT, Window 95, and SGI's IRIX) and provides support for a
number of 3D APIs.

To date, both Orchid Technology Inc.  and FMI Graphics Products
have signed OEM agreements with 3Dfx to develop consumer 3D game
boards based on Voodoo Graphics.  In addition, 3Dfx is working
with a large number of leading PC and coin-op game developers to
create multimedia titles based on the chipset.  Voodoo Graphics
is priced at less than $75 in 20,000 piece quantities (Suite 105,

pipeline than conventional low-end rasterization chips.  It can
render up to 160,000 Gouraud-shaded, bi-linear filtered,
perspectively correct texture-mapped, fogged, 50-pixel
triangles/second -- double-buffered scenes to be rendered at 30
frames/second at 640x480x65 KB colors, resulting in smooth,
realistic animations.  In addition, the chip provides MPEG-1
color space conversion and video scaling at 30 frames/second.

Comdex in Context

Several interesting parallels are apparent in the progression of
computing technology.  Desktop publishing, for example, brought
together the Apple Macintosh, Apple Laser Writer, and Aldus
PageMaker and, in the process, decimated the pre-press business.
Multimedia has yet to completely transform the audio production
business, but very few facilities exist without a Macintosh or
PC.  Likewise, the computer is changing the face of television
studio and post production facilities.  Avid Technology Inc.  is
at the forefront of integrating general purpose computers into
the television production environment.

All of these are examples illustrate how general purpose
technology -- albeit smaller in form and less expensive -- has
managed to assimilate the functions of older technology, becoming
ubiquitous in presence and still providing improved functionality
and performance over the old technology.  Where do 3D and
multimedia chips fit into this advancing tide of technology
progress? With the success of the movie Toy Story the prospect of
creating Toy Story-like animations on the computer and in real-
time is a frontier which companies are anxious to explore.

While 3D chip technology is in its infancy, it's potential has
excited many.  More fundamentally, multimedia technology is
making inroads upon itself.  Where multimedia brought sound to
the PC, we now see sound as part of a chip which offers all the
multimedia functions -- what one might call the super multimedia
chip.  What was standalone and isolated on the PC as an add-in
function has now disappeared into a chip with many functions.
This is the progressive pattern of electronics functionality --
the integration of more functions into silicon, so that its
distinct identity as a component is lost, but the functional
capabilities continue to increase.  Thus, as the quality of
multimedia improves, it becomes present in every PC, but
disappears as separate technology.  In the next wave of
technology advancement, multimedia is being transformed again.
One might say that at the same time it is disappearing,
multimedia is becoming omnipresent.  q

Keynote Address by Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., IBM Corporation

By JOHN N. LATTA, Ph.D.
SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

IBM CEO Louis Gerstner's keynote was unique, because it featured
very few visual aids.  In a relaxed, walk-around-the-stage
manner, Gerstner gave a compelling assessment of the impact of
information technology on society.  His announcement of the
Interpersonal Computer received considerable press --  but his
keynote was more profound than a product pitch.  Gerstner's
speech was both historical and visionary.  It challenged the
industry to address future issues on how computing technology
will impact society (PO Box 2150, Atlanta GA 30355, 404/238-
3182).

"Every now and then," Gerstner said, "a technology or an idea
comes along that is so profound, so powerful, so universal that
its impact changes everything -- the printing press; the
incandescent light; the automobile; manned flight.  It doesn't
happen often, but when it does, the world is changed forever.  I
joined this industry and IBM because I believe that information
technology has that potential."

Gerstner offered his thoughts on the future of IBM and its role
in making information technology "the defining technology of this
decade" and of the next century.  "IBM researchers see no limits,
for at least a decade, to the underlying technologies that drive
our industry," he said.  "Processor power, memory, disk capacity,
bandwidth -- the trajectories will continue upward."

To illustrate, Gerstner shared a few of the projects under
development in IBM labs.  He described a new kind of optical
microscope that could potentially image a single atom in visible
light.  "This same technology may eventually enable incredibly
dense storage devices that can pack information at densities one
hundred times higher than anything we can demonstrate today," he
said.  "That's the equivalent of putting the entire collection of
the Library of Congress -- sixteen million books -- on a diskette
the size of a penny."

Another product under development at IBM is a high-resolution
ThinkPad flat-panel display.  According to Gerstner, the
prototype that he saw at IBM's research laboratory delivered such
a high-quality image that he was unable to tell the difference
between a color photo attached to a ThinkPad display and a color
panel displaying an actual digital image.

Gerstner also described a speech-technology interface "that
doesn't just recognize dictation -- we have products today that
already do that.  This interface understood what I was saying, it
extracted the meaning of what I was asking for and delivered some
information in response."

The future of computing, said Gerstner, may be more than just
super high-resolution displays and speech recognition.  As he put
it, "Some [technologies] are really 'out there.'" Noting the
industry's tendency to describe itself in terms of faster,
better, cheaper pieces of hardware and software, Gerstner said,
"We're at the threshold of the next major phase of computing," he
said.  "It draws upon many of the technologies we've been
discussing, but one in particular -- high-speed, high-bandwidth
networking -- which is why we refer to it as 'network-centric
computing.'"

This phase of computing, Gerstner pointed out, follows two
others:  "The first was 'mainframe-centric' -- with a large
central processor, centralized data, centralized applications,
centralized systems and network management -- all serving
hundreds and hundreds of 'dumb' terminals," he said.  "This
wasn't a great model for end-users, because they were chained to
the central I/S department for computing power and applications."

The second phase of computing history occurred in the 1980s with
the emergence of the microprocessor, "which made possible the PC,
which made possible shrink-wrapped software, local area networks,
and on and on," according to Gerstner.  "So the model of
computing went from centralized to decentralized, and -- not
surprisingly -- so did the composition of our industry.  We went
from a few large integrated companies to 60,000 niche players,
and that nearly blew IBM up."

However, noted Gerstner, the promise of distributed computing has
not been fully realized.  "Our industry promised customers that
they could buy all these individual pieces, and put them together
very easily.  But that hasn't happened."  Faced with such issues
as system incompatibility and the expense of client/server
computing, "customers are beginning to wonder if they're getting
full value from all of the horsepower and software capability
they buy," said Gerstner.

While the PC solution is a step in the right direction, "is it
really the end-game?" asked Gerstner.  "We've come to understand
that client/server is, in fact, not a full-blown phase of
computing.  It's really the leading edge of what will be the next
phase:  network-centric computing."

While PCs and servers have become enormously powerful, he said,
"they communicate through the equivalent of soda straws."
Gerstner predicted that "very powerful networking technologies --
principally ATM -- will be to the next phase of computing what
the microprocessor was to the current phase... If the
communications link between the PC and the network is cheap
enough, fast enough, and has virtually unlimited bandwidth, why
not migrate a lot of the functions that currently reside inside
the PC to the network -- the applications, the data, the storage,
and even some of the processing?"

Customers, he pointed out, don't care where these functions take
place, "as long as what happens in front of the screen is
compelling, simple to use, and is the least-expensive solution
available."

In making the jump to network-centric computing, end-users will
find a number of advantages.  For example, Gerstner noted,
customers will be able to upgrade their PCs "by subscribing to
higher levels of computational power on the network."  Instead of
the consumer having to "figure out those arcane things called
operating systems," the network will "mask that complexity and
incompatibility."  In addition, with network-centric computing,
consumers will no longer have to buy "a shelf-full of
applications, swapping dozens of diskettes in and out, and
repeating this delightful task when version 2.5.4 comes out in
nine months."

Envisioning the evolution of a new "Interpersonal Computer" that
truly is suited for communications and interaction, Gerstner
predicted that there will be fundamental changes in PCs.
However, he said, "the network-centric world will not replace the
PC world entirely any more than the PC world replaced the
mainframe world entirely."

Network-centric computing will arrive in a number of guises, said
Gerstner.  It has already arrived in the form of the explosive
growth of the Internet, and it will come to the consumer market
in the form of interactive services to the home.  "We are seeing
[network-centric computing] take off first in businesses and
large institutions," Gerstner said.  "Technology is only an
enabler of a much more powerful force:  a whole new way that
institutions and companies have conceptualized their strategic
priorities.  They've discovered a powerful new form of leverage:
the leverage of organizational knowledge as a means to compete
more effectively and to differentiate themselves in the
marketplace."

Gerstner opined that the "most important, most valuable, most
sought-after content in the world belongs to corporations and
large institutions.  It's created and collected every minute,
around the world:  intellectual property, designs, market
intelligence, supply and demand, customer trends."  He said that
powerful networks can "unlock this knowledge, and move it to the
people who can use it effectively.  This drives shorter cycle
times and allows teams of people to become more productive and
creative."  These concrete, real-world benefits, said Gerstner,
are key in convincing companies to make large-scale investments
in network technology.

Gerstner predicted that as companies use networks to reach out to
their customers directly, the nature of competition will change
dramatically.  "Companies that stand between a supplier and a
customer will be on dangerous ground," he said.  "Something very
significant is happening here.  For the first time, the models of
computing that support businesses and institutions on the one
hand and individual users on the other are coming together...
They're converging network-centric computing."

As network-centric computing evolves, said Gerstner, "it will
transform every business, organization, and institution in the
world... It will change the way we do business, the way we teach
our children, communicate and interact as individuals."  Noting
that IBM is making "enormous investments in Internet products and
services," Gerstner stated, "We're taking network-centric
computing very seriously at IBM.  I'd say we're betting much of
our future on it."

According to Gerstner, some of the important issues involved in
network-centric computing include "complex network management,
systems management, heavy transaction processing, massive data
bases, powerful scalable servers, and systems integration... Now,
let me think, what company knows how to do all that?"

All kidding aside, Gerstner said that the future of computing is
"right before us," but will only happen if "we step up to certain
responsibilities as an industry."  These responsibilities, he
said, fit under one banner:  listening to the customer.  "I don't
think we pay nearly enough attention -- or spend nearly enough
money -- being sensitive and responsive to customers," he said.

"I think we need to work on many things, but three in
particular," said Gerstner.  "The first is ease of use" -- an
issue that "ranges from basic confusion over on-off switches and
loading software to the way we integrate and manage complex
systems."

The second major issue facing the industry is standards.  "Ours
is the only major industry I can think of that refuses to rally
around standards," he said.  "How are we ever going to get around
the problem of incompatible hardware and software systems?"
Gerstner offered two choices:  asking customers to set aside
their freedom of choice, and "all of us move to one architecture
provided by, priced by and controlled by one company.  Or, we can
embrace open industry standards.  Compliance with standards does
not mean that we won't compete aggressively or that we can't
distinguish our products.  We will.  But we'll compete on the
basis of innovative implementation of industry-standards
technologies and architecture -- on performance, features,
design, service, and support."

Finally, said Gerstner, "We've got to come to grips with the fact
that the proliferation of our technology raises some very
provocative and serious societal issues... Our industry operates
in free space.  It's part of the reason for its success.  This
freedom must be honored and protected -- but it also must be
earned."  He pointed out that while some people see the Internet
as the proverbial "information superhighway," others view it as
"a dangerous pipeline for pornography, intellectual property
theft, and a serious threat to commerce and privacy."

Another grave concern, Gerstner noted, is the issue of universal
access.  People are concerned about "creating a society of
technological 'haves' and 'have-nots.' Just last week," he said,
"I read a survey in Time magazine.  Nearly half the respondents
said that technological change was responsible for the growing
economic inequality between people.

"These are serious issues," he continued.  "There are many
different and divergent views on what to do about them.  Frankly,
most of the solutions that are being proposed are equally
troubling.  They raise questions of censorship, over-regulation,
and, of course, the specter that the fires of innovation that
drive our industry will be stamped out."

The information technology industry, said Gerstner, has grand and
ambitious visions.  "We're talking about no less than changing
the world in very fundamental ways," he said.  "Yet... what will
you hear and see here at Comdex? Megahertz, gigabits, and
multitasking.  There's a disconnect between our priorities and
those of a lot of people and governments."

The time has come, said Gerstner, "to step up to these
challenges... We must do this as individual companies, but also
as an industry."  He pointed to several effort already underway
to address some of these issues:  "The Worldwide Web Consortium
based at MIT is working with many companies, including IBM, on
filtering technologies and content rating for parents to use.
The Center for Democracy and Technology, also with the support of
many companies and advocacy groups, is working on free speech and
child protection.  And trade associations like the Computer
Systems Policy Project are working on privacy and cryptography."

While these organizations "have a lot of good thinking under
way," said Gerstner, "we have to be careful not to confuse
activity with results... We've got to lead, rather than be led."
Referring to such monumental events in history as the inventions
of the printing press and the incandescent light bulb, Gerstner
noted that it is "extraordinary and rare -- and humbling --
opportunity to earn a place in history.  I, for one, think we
will.  I think we will make our visions reality.  I think that as
stewards of our industry, we will step up to the challenges of
social responsibility."

Gerstner summed up his vision of the industry's future with an
inspirational call to arms.  "We will improve the world, and the
way we work, the way we communicate and live and learn as people.
I'm excited about that," he said.  "That's why as much as I've
talked to you today about various phases of computing, I also
wanted to emphasize that we must now also pass into a new phase
as an industry.

"We have grown, we have innovated, and we have prospered at a
rate unsurpassed by any other.  It's been an amazing,
breathtaking ride.  It can continue -- and accelerate -- if we
remember that our future rests on how well we respond to the
total needs of society and of our customers all around the
world."

Multimedia Partnering:  A Clash of Cultures

By Harrison M. Rose
SENIOR CONTRIBUTING EDITOR -- WEST COAST

In the November issue of Multimedia Monitor, this column focused
on raising money for multimedia production and development
(Monitor 11/95 p16).  This month, we will discuss multimedia
partnerships, with an emphasis on the people part of the
equation.

One way of looking at multimedia is through the convergence of
digital technology development and creative media development.
With this convergence comes the cultural clashes of language,
thought processes, deal making, and, especially, ego.  Many
multimedia industry participants are aware of the differences
arising from the conflicting methods of doing business, but the
conflicts of goals and ideals can be just as big a problem.
Though these problems are always there, the enthusiasm and spirit
of the entrepreneurial effort will often mask them, hiding them
from view -- only to have them come out to the deal-killing
foreground right when the legal groundwork is being laid to make
the deal real.  Avoiding the legal issues only make matters worse
in the long run, and trying to deal with the matters right up
front can destroy the project by souring the creative juices.

There is no easy time to get it right, especially when the
partners are in a rush to bring the project together.  If the pot
is big enough, and all of the necessary team members have enough
shared vision to either set their egos aside or to invest their
egos in the project, then the project has a good chance to
succeed.  However, often team members' personal goals are not
aligned with the project's goals.  This divergence becomes
critical when the misalignment is over the long-term purpose of
the venture -- is this to be an on-going business, or is this a
one-time project that may lead to additional projects in the
future?

The creative teams that produce intellectual property in the
movie business have a long history of "being virtual."  Many will
go from project to project together, adding value from their
history of working together, but there is no long-term commitment
to building added value.  In the software industry, only contract
programmers work to build such commitments.  Many executives,
marketers, and software developers (who prefer employment
positions over consulting contracts) see themselves in the
business of creating living products.  While most media-based
entertainment producers expect their participation to end once
the product ships (with the exception of public relations and
some marketing activity), software developers build products
expecting them to require after market service and support.
While entertainment producers may license previously existing
media (e.g., movie rights for a published book) or produce
sequels, software developers constantly build the new production
from scratch -- leveraging previously developed code, concepts,
or technologies.

Some entertainment producers, such as television producers or
magazine publishers, amortize creative costs over a series of
related story-line products.  With TV series, for example, major
sets will support several episodes, possibly the whole series,
like Star Trek:  Voyager.  Currently, multimedia titles do not
have available audiences the size of a television show or motion
picture.  Therefore, amortizing creative costs over a series of
CD-ROM titles is not currently in vogue.  In time, it will
probably come to be so.  The size of the installed base for the
CD-ROM and Internet markets (and maybe in several years,
Interactive TV) will grow to allow the cost-benefit equation to
fit the new creative medium.

Multimedia developers, especially ones seeking venture capital
funding, will often amortize the cost of the technology engine
over several proposed titles, while traditional film and video
producers build the technology for one-time usage and therefore
account for it on a cost basis.  Besides the accounting issue,
herein lies an obvious strategic-level conflict:  Software
developers need to plan for multiple titles, while entertainment
producers plan single titles.

On 8 November 1995, the Los Angeles, California-based law firm of
Irell & Manella, which specializes in "high
technology/multimedia/intellectual property law," held a seminar
in Menlo Park, California on Building Multimedia Alliances and
Making Them Work.  (Call them at 310/277-1010 for future
seminars.) Partners Roger Steinberg, Lois J.  Scali, and Theodore
E.  Guth, used a hypothetical situation to demonstrate the four
major recurring issues that groups face when negotiating an
alliance, whether formulating a single project or a new business:
exclusivity, termination, compensation, and control.  "Timing" is
a fifth and separate issue.

"Exclusivity" refers to the issue of deciding who may work for
others.  For example, take a record company entering into an
alliance with a multimedia developer.  To what extent can the
multimedia developer produce competitive products for other
record companies? On the other side, can the record company use
other multimedia developers? Another aspect of this issue,
especially seen here in the Silicon Valley and other high
technology centers, is the issue of time.  How much of the time
and staff will each devote to the venture? Creative media
producers often will have many projects going at the same time.
Software developers, who devote significant thought and effort to
any given project, will commonly work on only one project at a
time.  A software development executive may have several teams
working on several projects, but rarely will the hands-on
software folk work on several projects at the same time.

Another view of exclusivity is commitment.  If the principals of
a new start-up are not willing to be essentially exclusive to the
start-up, potential financial backers will flee.  They will tell
you, "Why should I put money into something of yours that you are
not committed to?" It appears that many members of the creative
media production community don't understand this concept, since
they have the experience of successfully raising funds for
individual projects.  This cultural conflict of focus can kill a
deal, as well, especially one that is attempting to raise venture
capital.  Because the market size in the multimedia universe is
substantially smaller, the risk is greater and the potential
return on investment more difficult to project.

With "termination" comes all the attending issues of dividing the
revenue streams, equity, and derivative values.  Who owns the
intellectual property, especially the new derivative product? If
there is a split-up, how do the parties divide the residual
revenues? What are the circumstances by which one person can walk
and start another business? Sometimes things don't work out
because constraints keep one partner from unexpected
opportunities.  For example, What if Disney offers your creative
partner an unbelievably rich opportunity? How could she say,
"No?" More to the point, why should she say, "No?"

"Compensation" covers the whole set of issues of who puts in the
money; how do they get recovery; how are the risks distributed;
and what are the relative values of intellectual property,
contacts, and abilities? When it is difficult to project
revenues, as happens with multimedia content products,
negotiating the revenue split becomes a problem.  Once you choose
the method of dividing income (which may have the initial revenue
going to pay back the investor), then control of costs becomes an
issue.  A project may generate subsequent value for the
multimedia developer's business that the partners feel should
benefit all partners.  As Steinberg says, "If the alliance is a
joint venture, there is always spill-over from the good will
created by the joint venture to the individual companies.  For
example, a multimedia developer getting more independent work
based on the joint venture, could pay royalty to the joint
venture or other partners."

When determining relative values contributed by the founders of a
new venture, it is relatively unimportant who came up with the
initial idea.  You have to ask what team you need to make the
venture fly, and recruit the missing members through equity and
other incentives.  To work out all of these issues, the proposed
team members need to engage in much dialog.  Theodore Guth
observes, "You often have to make a lot of these decisions before
you know the result."

When the joint venture is between existing companies, more
complex solutions are proposed.  "Complex solutions have their
own costs," Guth adds.  "Most end up with a 50-50 solution."  One
of the most difficult problems, however, is that, "models and
language between software and entertainment [companies] are very
different.  You have to listen to their language in their
context.  However," notes Guth, "these complex models help
minimize the risk.  The complexity rises as you deal with larger
companies."

An important reality check before initiating one of these
projects is the budget.  Ask the partners, "Do you realize how
many units you have to sell to provide a break-even?" Good
distribution is a necessity, because it is critical to the
success of the venture.  When the average price of a title drops,
the margins are hit hard.  If neither partner brings distribution
to the venture, then the venture has to establish a channel --
which can be very expensive and difficult to accomplish.

"Control" is the big bugaboo!  No matter how well the people get
along, there needs to be a designated method for tie-breaking.
Sometimes, it is a definition of who makes what kinds of
decisions.  Sometimes, it is a designated outside board member
who sits in as arbitrator.  If the team members' visions are in
competition, then there will be conflict.  In multimedia, "you
are making decisions with people that you don't have twenty years
of experience with," points out Ms.  Scali.  "Don't get too
quickly to a form, business model, relationships, etc., before
forming the corporation."

This is especially true when bargaining with larger partners,
such as between a small multimedia development group and a large
record producer.  According to the attorneys from Irell &
Manella, "The general perception when a break up occurs is
negative to the small company, regardless of reason.  Bargaining
power for the little company declines over time as you approach
the crisis point of effectiveness."  This is an important point -
- don't believe you are irreplaceable.

The issue of "timing" is a general issue for all alliances, joint
ventures, and business development.  Who do you bring in, at what
point, and at what cost? As the project advances, the variables
change values.  For example, a major challenge that often causes
alliances problems over time is that people often forget that
alliances need to be maintained.  As Guth puts it, "Like a
marriage, there is a lot of work that goes into maintaining an
alliance.  What are the pressures your champion faces within the
organization?" He strongly recommends periodically reflecting on
what's happening with your alliance partner.  Check your contract
regularly to see how it applies as your business and the alliance
develop and change over time.

As a profound example, consider the recent events at Kaleida (as
reported in last month's Multimedia Monitor).  Calliope Media's
CEO Jay Haifitz told me in response to the impending shut down,
"The announcement came as a complete shock.  Some people like
surprises, and I'm not one of them.  This was not a good
surprise."  In fact, Calliope Media was quite embarrassed by it.
When the announcement came, the company was at Comdex
demonstrating the first consumer title to be based on ScriptX.
"We were in a booth beating a drum very loudly," Haifitz recalls.

The attorneys from Irell & Manella point out, "The tension you
have between the two models, Hollywood versus Silicon Valley, is
absolutely real.  You need to ask the right questions and use the
same language."  They continue, "You can satisfy missing needs
with additional alliances.  There has to be a fundamental buying
into a common vision to make it work.  Otherwise, it could end up
with one person being the company and the other being a
consultant."

As a real world example of how difficult these issues really are,
consider a recent business deal I was trying to put together with
a highly talented group of movie makers who moved to the Silicon
Valley.  They had outlined a series of projects that had little
cohesion, while expressing the desire to build a digital studio
with long-term value goals.  I saw this as an opportunity to
marry several technologies and create a "21st century
entertainment company" that could produce digital interactive and
linear product for multiple distribution channels with inter-
channel leverage.  Several of their planned productions could be
dovetailed with a little planning.  They agreed, and we started
working together.  I began to pull the technical and business
teams together.  Suddenly, the deal hit a major road bump,
because of a cultural conflict.

In this case, the cultural conflict was essentially a question of
control.  These movie makers had left Hollywood to gain control
over the creative process and feared the possible control that a
CEO and board of directors would have over them.  By using a
creative organizational structure, I thought we had solved this
issue, only to have it resurface when they sought legal advice
about the structure -- without me.  The legal advice they
received caused them to collapse the structure and, hence, the
deal.

Attorneys will give you advice based upon the information that
you give them.  If they do not have all the information -- which
they never do -- their advice will reflect this knowledge gap.
Lawyers rarely ask about the underlying issues.  This is
especially true during a preliminary information meeting, since
the attorney is trying to win you as a client at this point.
When you seek legal counsel about setting up a partnership or new
corporate structure, all parties should be present.  You should
have separate counsel, as well, to represent your own interests.
Remember, if the deal is killed, then there are no interests to
protect.

During the formative period, conflicts between partners or team
members will occur.  One of the parties -- preferably the team's
leader -- should have the training or ability to negotiate and
settle conflicts by raising the actual issues out of the muck and
mire of the specific circumstances.  (I recommend the classic
Getting To Yes by Roger Fisher, published by Houghton Mifflin, if
this technique if it is new to you.) People make the business --
and multimedia requires many kinds of people.  The process is
very difficult -- but, potentially, very rewarding.

multimedia and Web development tools presented at MacWorld.

3DO Reports Second Quarter Results

The 3DO Company reported that for the second quarter ended 30
September 1995, it had a net loss of $8.8 million, or ($0.34) per
share, against a loss of $12.8 million, or ($0.55) per share, for
the same period one year ago.  Revenue in the quarter rose 42
percent to $7.1 million from $5 million last year.  Publishing
revenues rose more than fivefold in the second quarter to $2.7
million -- up from $500,000 in the second quarter of last year.
Meanwhile, royalties and pressing fees roses to $2.8 million from
$2.3 million.

``We're feeling pretty good these days,'' said Trip Hawkins (3DO
chairman and chief executive officer).  "... The big increase in
revenues should continue in the current quarter.'' Hawkins said
he expects 3DO to turn a profit in its fourth fiscal quarter
ending March 1996, but does not expect a full year profit before
fiscal 1997, which begins in April (600 Galveston Drive, Redwood
City CA 94063-4746, 415/261-2792).

Study Shows Apple's Worldwide Market Share is Up

According to Dataquest Inc.'s preliminary results for the third
calendar quarter of 1995, Apple Computer Inc.'s worldwide market
share rose to 9.0 percent -- up from 7.4 percent in the second
calendar quarter of 1995.  Compaq, with a worldwide market share
of 10.5 percent, still holds the lead.  Dataquest cited healthy
US sales and Apple's continued strength in the education and
consumer markets as factors influencing the company's increased
market share.

"These findings illustrate the vitality of the Macintosh platform
around the world," said Michael Spindler (president of Apple).
"Clearly, our strategic focus on key customer segments is
increasing customer acceptance, and helping us achieve our
desired goal of overall increased market share" (Apple, Lynne
Keast, One Infinite Loop, Cupertino CA 95014, 408/974-5431;
Dataquest, 408/437-8000).

Hall Dickler Forecasts Says Internet Lawsuits Inevitable

In its annual ADLAW Forecast, Hall Dickler Kent Friedman & Wood
offers some predictions for advertisers and the Internet in 1996:

Calling cyberspace "a virtual free for all," Doug Wood (Hall
Dickler executive partner) said that "reckless abandon will cause
a plethora of lawsuits in 1996."  In the rush to create a Web
presence, more and more agencies and advertisers will be faced
with lawsuits over copyright and trademark infringement, privacy
rights, and union talent claims, predicts Hall Dickler.
"Agencies and advertisers are simply not exercising their usual
restraint," said Wood.  "Many are ignoring third-party rights as
they enter cyberspace."

Wood also predicted that 1996 will see the first major libel case
against an advertiser or an advertising agency for its billboard
or "chat" locations.  "Unlike Prodigy and Compuserve, which both
had novel defenses as publishers and common carriers in recent
cases, those same defenses will fail in an action against an
advertiser or agency," said Wood.

The Hall Dickler forecast also suggests that as the Web explodes,
the big online services will make major attempts to control more
pages and domains in order to prevent opening competition to
independent server providers.  "Antitrust lawsuits and
investigations will spring up in reaction to brutal competition
and business failures by independents," according the report (909
3rd Avenue, New York NY 10022-4731, 212/339-5400).

IDC/LINK Says International Market Hot for Home PCs

In its Global New Media Consumer Survey, IDC/LINK said that by
the end of 1995, consumer PC shipments to Europe, Asia, and
Pacific Rim were expected to outpace shipments to the US by 34
percent ($22 billion versus $16 billion).  By the year 2000,
consumers in international markets are forecast to spend more
than $48 billion on home PCs, exceeding by 78 percent US
estimated expenditures of $27 billion, according to the report.

The Global New Media Consumer Survey also notes that 20.4 million
households in the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific Rim
owned multiple PCs in 1995 -- a figure IDC/LINK expects will more
than double to 50 million households by the year 2000.
Additionally, repeat buyers are more likely to purchase the same
brand as their current PC.

The Global New Media Consumer Survey was based on primary
research gathered through telephone and in-home interviews with
more than 15,000 households in the United States, France,
Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Hong Kong, India,
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan (Suite 1420, 2 Park
Avenue, New York NY 10016, 212/726-0900).

Consumer CD-ROM Titles in Print Up 93 Percent in 1995, Says
InfoTech

According to its year-end survey of the CD-ROM industry, InfoTech
reports that consumer CD-ROM titles in print grew from 2,032 in
1994 to 3,919 in 1995 -- an increase of 93 percent.  However,
retail shelf space increased just 24 percent over 1994.  With the
majority of US retailers stocking just slightly more than 250
titles, few of thousands of titles in print get any significant
US retail distribution.  According to InfoTech president Julie
Schwerin, it is the "established publishers with a track record
of hit titles and captive distribution arms" that attain the
breadth of distribution necessary for success.

The average shelf life of consumer CD-ROM titles has decreased
from 130 in 1994 to 102 in 1995; the shelf life of titles in the
highly competitive games category can be considerably shorter.
"A new title must sell-through strongly immediately at launch,"
said Schwerin.  "If not, there are 15 other titles waiting to
take its place."  This strong competition also has contributed to
a 21 percent decline in retail weighted average selling prices
for consumer titles.

Nevertheless, publishers remain "enthusiastic," according to
InfoTech, which predicts an increase of 42 percent in the number
of titles in print during 1996 (against a 20 to 25 percent growth
rate in the retail channel).  "As the industry consolidates and
product lines are rationalized, we expect the rate of growth in
titles in print to slow to around 30 percent in 1997," said
Schwerin (Box 150, Skyline Drive, Woodstock VT 05091, 802/763-
2097, fax 802/763-2098).

Zona Says Consumer Potential of Internet Over-Hyped

In its new study entitled Internet vs.  Intranet:  Markets,
Opportunities, and Trends, Zona Research Inc.  says the golden
opportunity for Internet technologies lies not in consumer-
oriented commerce across the 'Net, but in applying Internet
technologies within organizations:  "The Intranet."

"Based on our surveys and analysis of Internet domain
distribution, online service customers, and other available
surveys, we conclude that the prospects for commercial consumer
use of the Internet are vastly overstated," said Stephen Auditore
(president, Zona).  In fact, Zona estimates that there are less
than six million commercial online service subscribers who even
possess the connectivity underlying technology to use the World
Wide Web.  "The notion of tens of millions of consumers jumping
online, exercising their purchase prerogative, is grossly over-
hyped," Auditore said.

"The real market potential for Intranet technology -- servers,
browsers, indexers, retrieval and authoring systems, and other
related technologies," said Auditore, "will exceed $400 million
for 1995."  With more than 15 million users who have an
infrastructure in place allowing them to use the World Wide Web,
organizations and enterprises will be able to more easily
quantify the benefits associated with using Internet technologies
for internal communication and productivity enhancements, Zona
contends.  Internet vs.  Intranet:  Markets, Opportunities and
Trends is 170+ plus pages and is priced at $895 (Suite 102A, 497
Seaport Court, Redwood City CA 94063, 415/568-5700, fax 415/306-

Fancy Passes Are Probably Just Passing Fancies

By:
Fritz Nelson

The first time I saw Magic Johnson play basketball, I was compelled
to run to the nearest playground. On that chilly winter day,
I discovered the wonders of the no-look pass by drilling the
ball into the frozen face of an unsuspecting friend.

While surprise passes on the playground can make you a legend,
either by basket or broken nose, surprise passes in the magazine
world are a constant source of trouble and amusement.

For instance, Cisco and NBase submitted products that didn't
qualify for Rob Kohlhepp's cover story on low-cost switches this
month "The Riches of Switches").  I suppose our product request
letter, which we sent to more than 50 vendors, wasn't explicit
about the price requirement.  Maybe we should have said, "Your
product must list for $250 per port or less, and we really mean
it."

Unfortunately, we did a great deal of switch testing before
we discovered the little anomaly, using, I think, that famous
10th RMON group that reports price per port (RFC $99.99). Cisco
offered a new, adequately priced configuration, so we included
the company.

But I never can tell whether vendors do this on purpose or not.
Last year's review of SNMP-manageable UPSes yielded a handful
of UPSes without SNMP capabilities. Perhaps some vendors missed
that requirement in our letter. I can never remember the rule
 Am I supposed to state the requirement three times, or four?
More likely, some vendors didn't support SNMP-they probably
didn't know what it was.

No matter. The philosophy, it seems, is just send it, and hope
we don't get our noses bent out of shape.

Readers dribble the ball off their feet also.  Some just dribble
down their chin.  This month, one of you sent the following
message to Judy Biener, who creates our E-mail Poll "Olde Lang
Syne and All That Jazz"):  "Judy, There's a dinner in it for you
if I win the IBM 360CE Notebookmy treat, anywhere between NYC and
New Hampshire."  As if.

Judy's response: "That's a little cheap for a laptop. I'd expect
at least dinner and a show." You go girl.

Something Up Our Sleeves

Such slight-of-hand only takes you so far. Magic Johnson's real
talent, for example, wasn't his wizardry with the ball, but
how effortless he made it seem (and please, old geezers, no
letters about Bob Cousy and Earl Monroe). The hard work is
what lurked somewhere up his sleeve. Art Wittmann and Dave
Molta lurk up Network Computing's sleeve. Their voices may
be subtle to some of you, heard only through occasional feature
stories or product reviews, but they've firmly guided us with
their unique real-world perspectives for the past five years.
We unleash them this month with their first columns.

Art, always the fearless pioneer, will use "On the Edge" to
explore new trends and technology. His column will alternate
with Bill Alderson and Scott Haughdahl's currently running
"On the Wire" missives. This month, Art begins on familiar
ground, with some insights on the latest ATM developments ("ATM
 Ready or Not? Here It Comes!" page 149), inspired by recent
visits with Cisco and Bay Networks-two vendors who, he says,
enjoy getting not-so-subtle digs on one another during his
visits.

Dave's "Net Results" column will alternate with Bruce Robertson's
"In the Middle" reports, which is both fitting and ironic.
Where Dave has been far more involved behind the scenes, Bruce
has had an overt presence since Network Computing began life
five years ago. But Bruce will be fading away this month as
he begins a new job with The Meta Group, a consulting firm
based in Reston, Va. Although he will continue to write his
"In the Middle" column, I will miss his abundant middleware
metaphors, his insights, his shot-blocking talent, his friendship.
He also leaves us with two final masterpieces: "Driving Applications
on the Network," page 68, and "To DB2 From the Desktop: Too
Many Ways," page 152.

Dave Molta's masterpiece ("The Sweet Music of Network Management,"
page 159) kicks off a column that will uncover network management
from the inside, exploring how technical managers can work
within organizations to make a real impact on the bottom line.

Dave's impact includes having season tickets to Syracuse
University's men's basketball games.  At center court.  Row J.
(Want his number?)  Recently, Bruce Boardman was in the Syracuse
University lab on a Saturday afternoon, working on his bottom
line-turning in this month's review of Fast Ethernet Analyzers
"Network Analyzers Race to Capture Fast Ethernet But Need To Rev
Their Engines")-when Dave strolled in dangling tickets to that
day's game.  But Bruce turned Dave down so he could finish his
Fast Ethernet analyzer testing.  Now that's certainly dedication.

Yet, between you and me, I'm just a little bit worried about
Bruce. Dave tells me that when Bruce does go to games, Bruce
tends to talk about filtering and decoding referee signals.
Once he suggested to coach Jim Boeheim that he put a Sniffer
in the other team's huddle during timeouts. I'm not one to
pry or, ahem, probe, but I'd suggest Bruce try a little more
social interaction.

Playing Well With Others

Maybe he should take a queue from this month's workshop, "Adding
Interactive Services to Your Web Server".  It offers an in-depth
exploration of building feedback into your Web server-an
important element, given that much of today's content is, in the
words of Tim Haight, executive editor, about as interactive as a
Buckingham Palace guard.

The workshop's writer, our former colleague, Eric Hall, who's
had his share of run-ins with a palace guard or two, used several
Web server products in his testing, but stuck mostly with his
favorite: O'Reilly Software's WebSite. Meanwhile Syracuse University's
Scott Campbell and Josh Linder, and our own Rob Kohlhepp were
testing Web Servers (see "Serving Up HTML Documents on the
Web"), where WebSite did extremely well.

Sometimes these things just come together, like a perfect alley
oop pass, or an IBM ThinkPad and a scrumptious meal in New
Hampshire.

Oh, were you expecting someone else in this space?

Letters: Generation X.500



I am still shaking my head in amazement. How can any journalist
worth his salt write an article on directory services (Bruce
Robertson's "Too Many Directories and Too Many Applications,"
November 1, 1995, page 119), and fail to include even one reference
to the ISO X.500 directory service standard? Moreover, how
can he have the gall to state, "There is no agreed-upon directory
standard," when an agreed-upon international directory standard
is exactly what X.500 is?

I understand that there's an obsession today with proprietary
vendor directory standards, but to write about directory service
without acknowledging that the problem is being solved in the
international standards arena strikes me as incompetent journalism.

Bruce Robertson replies:

X.500 hasn't penetrated corporate application developers outside
the X.400 e-mail space much. It's not an oversight, just a
question of focus. If I had included X.500, the overall points
of the article would not have changed. X.500 is yet another
directory.

Letters: The Net Dimension



Thanks very much to Patricia Schnaidt for an excellent article,
"The Four Dimensions of Net Management," (November 15, 1995,
page 31). I couldn't agree with her words more. To quote Schnaidt,
"The problem isn't managing any one box-it's managing all of
them." You might agree IT organizations always lean toward
one or the other, sometimes more than one.

Letters: Dream A Wireless Dream



I really enjoyed Bill Frezza's piece on the wireless data debacle
("Bewildered in the Wireless Market," November 1, 1995, page
35). I concur that the writing's on the wall if the astrolabe
doesn't start pointing to the right star soon.

What of commercial digital cellular? In Europe, GSM and DCS
1800 (and soon PCS-1900 in the U.S. and Canada) digital data
is "going potty" and then some. People are using PC Cards in
their handheld Psion Series 3a's and others a-plenty. More
PC Card makers are releasing faster, cheaper models for more
types of handsets. The race is on among vendors to offer customers
compatible software, and it is not through another door in
the wireless data room, but a window in the ceiling-the skylight.

No wonder the dedicated packet mobile data offerings have found
it tough-going. The GSM standard, for example, is well underway
in adding a General Digital Packet Data (GDPD) to carry the
data packets so as not to flood voice channels. Tariffing will
be per-second billing on the whole, though some providers may
bundle data packet traffic as a USP. Where the existing offerings
will end up is clear: Where they are is where they'll stay.
Just because a couple of RD-LAP and Mobitex protocols are here
today, let's not get confused. Gates will get Teledesic to
work with it, too, if the satcomm bubble holds out long enough.

Recall CP/M and M/PM. Nothing wrong with them. They just timed
out before the market rebooted into another command environment.
RD-LAP and Mobitex will have places in wireless history, as
will AMPS, TACS, NMT, C-450, POCSAG and GWBASIC. Let's compare
like with like in the wireless time-continuum. When we realized
that the radio spectrum was as good for data as it had always
been for voice, we were guilty of jumping the gun and becoming
too Asimovian in our dreams of what could be done.

Letters: Tape Rewind



While we appreciate Exabyte's EXB-10h and EXB-210 8-mm tape
libraries having been included in Eric Carr's October 1, 1995,
autoloader roundup review ("As Storage Needs Grow, Tape Autoloaders
Help Take Away the Pain," page 100), we also want to clear
up some incorrect information.

Regarding the EXB-10h, several factual errors appeared. The
EXB-10h has neither a bar-code option nor dual-drive capability.
In addition, the product identified in the photo on page 102
as being an EXB-10h is in fact an EXB-210. And, while the EXB
10h and the EXB-210 are stated to be original and second-generation
products, respectively, they are actually third-generation
products featuring more robust and reliable designs. As a clarification,
the starting price of the EXB-210 is $9,800.

It may seem odd for us to wish to point out that the EXB-10h
actually has less features than you attributed to it. However,
we feel it's important to note that Exabyte offers a family
of tape libraries built to fit a variety of needs within a
range of market segments.

It's Quiet Out There...

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Too quiet! While Internet security breaches haven't made headlines
recently, Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center
recently said it is receiving daily reports of "widespread
attacks against Internet sites."

CERT spotlighted several trends in a recent advisory: The use
of protocol analyzers whose presence on a network is disguised
with Trojan horse software; exploiting the rpc.updated or loadmodule
vulnerabilities to gain root access; using automated tools
to scan sites for NFS and NIS vulnerabilities, and launching
IP spoofing attacks.

Additional information about these trends, plus information
and tools to combat them, can be accessed at ftp://info.cert.org
pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:18.README. CERT advisories and bulletins
are posted on the USENET newsgroup comp.

security.announce. To be added to the mailing list for CERT
advisories and bulletins, send your e-mail address to cert
advisory-request@cert.org. If you see activity indicating an
attack in progress, CERT urges you to contact other sites involved
and the service providers, as well as the CERT Coordination
Center.

ATM Forum To Downsize

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

The ATM Forum is about to get a trim, with Chair and President
Steve Walters wielding the scissors. Faced with an increasing
threat to desktop ATM by 100-Mbps Ethernet and the uncontrolled
growth of the Forum, Walters advocates curtailing or cutting
some of its working groups and forming a management committee
to screen the formation of new ones. Today, about 750 people
attend the organization's bimonthly week-long meetings, each
of which costs $90,000. Walters says he isn't trying to target
particular working groups. However, he says it's important
to ATM's desktop positioning to find out quickly whether LAN
emulation will scale, and to come up with an alternative if
it won't. He also wants to avoid potential overlaps, like those
that now exist between the Forum's PNNI specification and the
work of the Internet Engineering Task Force.

Auto Network Goes Virtual

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Economics prompted the top three U.S. automakers to restructure
the industry's plans for an exclusive Internet, complete with
a network exchange point (See Online News on Network Computing
Online at http://www.techweb.cmp). The proposal, known as the
Automotive Network eXchange, now calls for traffic between
the auto industry and its partners to be mixed with that of
the public Internet over backbone links. Last November it wasn't
yet clear whether access links would remain pristine or go
virtual, according to Chrysler's Fred Hakim. Plans remain in
place to seek better performance, reliability and security
over the Internet through certification of suppliers by an
"ANX authority." Hakim says the group hopes to have an RFP
available in the second quarter.

NT Shares Room With A SystemView

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

IBM-make that the "new IBM"-tells us to expect a SystemView
management console on Microsoft's NT to ship this year. Lynn
Wilczak, IBM SystemView marketing director also expects beta
tests to begin early this year on at least one point product
that takes a piece of SystemView-NetView Distribution Manager
and couples it with NT. Wilczak says the marriage is one users
have urged. They've also indicated a need for storage management
on NT and NetView on NT (delivered in early fall through a
cooperative agreement of IBM and Digital Equipment). In early
December, IBM was also expected to announce an object-oriented
performance management architecture for client/server computing
on SystemView for AIX. The goal is to measure, centralize and
automate performance management tasks over LANs and WANs to
address client/server computing. Key to the architecture are
software probes that can be deployed on any device, with management
traffic controlled by user-defined thresholds. Beta testing
of the probes was expected to begin last month with management
application testing this month. Since May, IBM has announced
SystemView for AIX (shipping), OS/2 (expected to ship by late
last October), MVS (expected by last December) and the AS/400
(expected by mid-96)

Statshot: Internet A Hit With IS Managers

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

A recent Dataquest study shows that IS managers in medium-size
to large organizations in the U.S. have enthusiastically embraced
Internet use. More than 60 percent of the 100 IS decision-makers
surveyed said all their departments had Internet access. More
than 80 percent considered the Internet a reliable source of
information. When asked how they preferred to receive the kinds
of information listed below, they chose Internet delivery by
the large percentages shown. More info: (508) 871-6630.

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Northern Telecom must not think cable-telco competition is so
far-fetched. It just freely lent a DMS-500 central office switch
to CableLabs. CableLabs' Bob Cruickshank will test local service
over hybrid fiber/coax first, then interexchange services,
to provide one source to hotels for cable, TV, PC and Internet
access.

Quick Bits: The Wrist Risk Of The '90s?

By:
Timothy Haight and Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Do you work at a keyboard, travel extensively, feel stressed
and forget to eat? Do you come in from the cold and hit that
PC? Are you a woman facing mid-life hormonal changes? All these
factors-not just ergonomically incorrect furniture-can contribute
to repetitive stress injuries. In 15 years, RSI is up from
14 to 60 percent of all occupational illnesses. The best prevention
book we've found is Joan Stigliani's The Computer User's Survival
Guide, O'Reilly & Associates, $21.95.

If there is something we ought to know, we welcome proposals
for articles. Please e-mail us at H-REPORT@nwc.com.

Which Operating System For Your 'Intranet'

By:
Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

It's enough to make a marketeer drool. By the year 2000, Forrester
Research estimates that the public network server hardware
market will hit $2.5 billion, but that's small change. The
"intranet" market of corporate networks based on Internet technology
is expected to be five to 10 times larger. With that much at
stake, it's little wonder that Jamie Zartman, Meta Group program
director, compares server manufacturers to 2,000 supertankers
making a mid-course correction. Just about every operating
system from IBM's mainframe-based MVS to Microsoft's NT is
being repositioned as an Internet server platform. It's too
early for the prognosticators to single out winners, but the
victor is clear in one large market segment-Internet service
providers (ISPs)

Among ISPs, Unix rules, and it's worth examining why some of
the most experienced TCP/IP users refuse even to contemplate
giving up the OS. Of course, as Michael O'Dell, UUNET Technologies
vice president of research and development, puts it, Unix "is
the devil you know versus the one you don't." Still, the issue
is much larger and has relevance for large intranet builders
as well as those shopping for an ISP.

For ISPs, Unix is a natural because the openness of its variants
like Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDI) and LINUX-allows
easy access for kernel performance tweaking as well as security
enhancements. Many ISPs also insist that only Unix provides
the scalability they need. Among the many variations of Unix,
Sun Microsystems SunOS, is the leader. Experts estimate that
50 to 75 percent of today's ISP-based servers are Sun-based.

Of course, even within a given provider network, the particular
purpose of a server-whether it's domain name services, e-mail,
news feeds, shell account access, PPP/SLIP access, router/applications
or Web hosting-can lead to differences in approach. Some ISPs
make it a policy to ban the use of any off-the-shelf OS running
stored programs on a transit network, since that network is
so vulnerable to security breaches. Instead, those applications
run behind a firewall along with the administrative network.
While Unix is the OS of choice, the box isn't always a workstation.
Some ISPs run e-mail services on Unix-based Macintoshes. Intel
PCs are also used extensively.

Web hosting is expected to be provided on a variety of platforms,
of course. Many ISPs are serving NT because of its growing
base on corporate networks. Beta testing of Microsoft's own
Internet Information Server on NT began in late November, with
shipments expected this quarter. Where demon performance is
needed, Silicon Graphics servers have often been the first
choice, although some ISPs grouse about SGI's lack of software
portability, skimpy management capabilities and high price.
Nevertheless, SprintLink, one of the world's largest backbone
providers, relies extensively on SGI servers. Hewlett-Packard,
with its reputation for price-performance, lays claim to more
than half of America Online's servers.

Lessons for Users What are some of the lessons ISP reliance
on Unix brings to users building large intranets? A fundamental
one is that Unix's performance edge comes at the price of hiring
a highly sophisticated staff. UUNET's O'Dell is among those
bringing on more Intel Pentium platforms running a variety
of Unix OSes, especially BSDI.

UUNET's Intel boxes are from Digital Equipment Corp. While such
boxes often let ISPs reduce costs as they ramp up, what O'Dell
likes most about BSDI is its openness. "We can whack on these
boxes and tune them to squeeze out every drop of performance."
The downside, however, is that their keyboards and monitors
make their operation in a central location klugey at best and
have so far ruled out their use in lights-out centers.

What should users conclude about an ISP relying extensively
on Unix PCs? On the upside, Dave Crocker, principal with Brandenburg
Consulting, says ISPs that depend instead exclusively on Unix
workstations may overburden their machines, rather than quickly
bringing new Unix-based PCs online. One way for users to check
out such a situation is to see if the ISP will offer a per
port guarantee, such as no more than 10 users per port. The
downside for PCs is the fact that some lack parity checking,
he says. "One reason people go for the workstation is that
it's constructively mindless. The buyer has to be more informed
and intelligent to get a PC platform that is good." Analysts
agree that some large ISPs have this knowledge, while many
smaller ones can vary dramatically in their skill levels.

Getting TCP/IP Techies Another feature to pay attention to in
a server OS-especially for a Web server-is the accompanying
TCP/IP implementation in the server's Unix kernel. Different
kernels support varying numbers of TCP/IP Control Blocks (TCBs).
Internet Architecture Board member and Network Computing columnist
Robert Moskowitz warns that because the Netscape browser retrieves
objects in parallel, rather than sequentially, it can tie up
a larger number of TCBs. Each TCB must then wait a given interval
two minutes in many cases-to clear errors and once again be
usable. Moskowitz believes that the popularization of Netscape
means that more and more TCBs are used to download numerous
small objects on a home page, elongating the user's waiting
period and causing more timeouts.

Unless Netscape and other browser vendors address the problem
using new technologies like persistent connections, Moskowitz
says it will be up to Web providers to tune existing kernels,
pick those supporting the most TCBs and impress on designers
the importance of using maps versus individual objects.

Does It Scale? ISPs also like Unix's scalability. Sun President
Ed Zander says NT "like everything else Microsoft does, is
technically very average, and they hope to get it to market
based on sheer economics, volume and market size. NT doesn't
scale well." Nigel Ball, director of marketing for HP's General
Systems Division, also boasts that NT "might scale on two-CPU
Intel systems, but we have 12-way RISC scaling-orders of magnitude
better than NT."

Analysts say NT's chief asset will be the many inexpensive applications
developed for it as an Internet server. A Microsoft official
also emphasizes NT's ease of deployment, management and application
support. He also calls the argument that NT doesn't scale "a
red herring" because "99 percent of the market needs four processors
or less, and the eighth-largest Internet site in the country
is a two or four-processor NT server" at Microsoft "that scales
quite well."

Cisco Technical Lead, Tony Li, has his own assessment of the
server's future: "the ISPs will continue to suffer scaling
problems as they try to cope with exponential growth. The server
that lets them roll their own, fix their own problems, and
provide stable, cost-effective performance will win. I expect
some flavor of BSD just based on the programming environment.
Hardwarewise, it's probably still a Pentium/Intel architecture."

Cisco Acquisition Deals Blow To IPv6

By:
Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Cisco Systems fed the fire of doubt surrounding IPv6 when it
announced this past fall that it is buying address translation
firewall leader Network Translation Inc. (NTI). Peter Long,
a marketing manager for Cisco, speculates-without seeing the
code-that NTI's integration into the Cisco OS will occur by
the second half of 1996. Long admits that if IP address translation
like NTI's is made widely available by Cisco, it will delay
IPv6. That isn't necessarily bad, he says, since it gives everyone
more time to think about next generation technology. Long says
Cisco will show an IPv6 prototype this month and provide product
support when the standard is formalized, perhaps by year's
end. The key technology question raised by Cisco's effort to
mix the stateful technology of NTI with stateless router technology
is whether Cisco is working on its own next generation router.
An NTI source says that the only way to integrate the products
is to change the nature of routing. That's already happening,
he says, as basic packet pushing is moved off the router onto
switches. So, will we see a new stateful "router" from Cisco,
replete with security and address translation features?

The Internet Hit List

By:
Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Had problems traversing the Internet lately? Want to know if
you are among those inefficient addresses ("Users Cut Off as
Internet Nears Routing Limit," November 1, 1995, page 24) being
exorcised in transit across SprintLink? Here's a clue: You
obtained your address directly from the InterNIC and you have
32 or fewer Class C allocations in block 206 or higher. (The
first three numbers in your address are the block.) Originally,
SprintLink began filtering at 64 or fewer Class C allocations
in block 206, but cut back to 32 last autumn. For block 207
or higher, SprintLink is still filtering at 64 Class C allocations
or fewer. Because so many service providers use upstream providers,
like SprintLink, traffic between two parties can be dropped
even though neither party uses SprintLink for Internet Access.
Also, some small ISPs may be using "inefficient addresses"
to maintain independence from upstream providers. If you think
you may be on the "hit list," check with your ISP and any upstream
providers. The InterNIC advises users to read ftp://rs.interNIC.net
policy/interNIC/interNIC-IP-1.txt, and to use the InterNIC
only as an address provider of last resort. Our own caveat
is that as address space declines and router congestion becomes
more of an issue, the bar at which today's addresses are filtered
can only be raised.

V-ONE Chisels Commerce Drawbridge In Internet Firewalls

By:
Christine Hudgins-Bonafield

Security startup V-ONE, Rockville, Md., is being heralded by
security experts as a shining example of Internet innovation
perhaps as much as a year ahead of the pack. The company, which
is reportedly going public early this year, was expected to
introduce its SmartGate technology in mid-December. Instead
of simply erecting a barrier to Internet access, SmartGate
is intended to provide controlled access. Using a separate
key for each network session, SmartGate promises to regulate
how far authenticated individuals (not machines) can drill
into a Web server or even through nested firewalls. General
Electric Information Systems and Computer Systems Corp. are
among those planning to use the product. Other V-ONE security
products are used by several military intelligence agencies
and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forrester Research
analyst Iang Jeon says SmartGate represents the next wave for
the Internet: beefed-up authentication. And CSC's Matt Mancuso
says he is especially "enamored" of SmartGate's ability to
authenticate end users through software or smartcards, instead
of through their machines. Jeon is also impressed with the
product's promised use with any TCP/IP application and the
crytographic background of V-ONE's employees.

The Networkologist: Salary Survey Shows Satisfaction

By:
Patricia Schnaidt

With client/server applications no longer the dreamy stuff of
magazine headlines, but rather the gritty reality of IS shops,
it's no wonder that the people who can build reliable networks
are in hot demand. Network Computing's first survey of our
readers' job satisfaction and salary tells the story of the
average network professional: a 39-year-old male making $51,840
a year, satisfied with his work, enjoying the challenge of
his demanding job but nevertheless feeling overworked. Let's
dig a little deeper and get at what's behind "the average"
network professional.

In 1995, the mean salary, including bonuses and incentives,
was $54,810, and the median salary was $51,360. In 1994, the
same group's mean salary was $51,980 and the median was $47,520.
That's a 5.2 percent increase in average compensation. The
network professionals we surveyed were 88 percent male and
12 percent female.

Challenged and Busy

The vast majority of network and IS professionals like their
jobs: 27 percent reported being very satisfied and 58 percent
reported being moderately satisfied, while only 15 percent
reported being not very or not at all satisfied. Challenge,
not wages, fuels most of the job satisfaction, while conversely,
wages, not challenge, fuels most of the job dissatisfaction.
Of those who expressed satisfaction with their jobs, 37 percent
said that the challenge of their work contributes the most
to their satisfaction, 24 percent said that exposure to new
technologies is what they like best, and 7 percent said that
the most satisfying aspect of their work is their company's
progressiveness in IT. Only 6 percent cite compensation.

So what makes network professionals unhappy? For all those surveyed,
topping the list at 18 percent is salary. On the heels of underpay
is overwork at 16 percent. Eleven percent identified the company's
lack of progressiveness in IT, 8 percent said that the organization
offered little potential for career advancement, and 6 percent
said it was a lack of professional development.

With the plethora of new technologies, ever-expanding enterprise
networks and client/server application deployment, it's no
surprise that network professionals barely have time to answer
their beepers. Forty-five percent said they were very challenged
by their work; 47 percent said they were moderately challenged.
A scant 9 percent said they were not very or not at all challenged.
What disturbs network professionals' evenings, weekends and
daylight hours is keeping up with changing technology (at 38
percent), keeping up with the organization's demand for IS
projects and deployments right behind it (at 36 percent), a
lack of organizational funding for IT projects (at 24 percent),
a management that doesn't understand the role of MIS (at 23
percent), and users' demand for services (at 19 percent). Six
percent said that the available technology didn't meet business
requirements.

While network professionals name the challenge of their work
as one of its greatest appeals, 60 percent said that they were
consistently overworked, while only 36 percent said they had
the right amount of work and a scant 5 percent said that they
didn't have enough work to keep them busy. No surprise. Network
professionals are stressed out and they say that their job
related stress is rising: 90 percent said that their jobs were
very or moderately stressful. Maybe CFOs should offer stress
reducing massages and consider distributing multivitamins with
network professionals' paychecks.

What are network professionals doing all day? Topping the to
do list is network management and problem solving, followed
by assisting users, planning and strategy, deploying networks,
managing personnel and working with division managers to implement
systems.

But Wait, There's More

Check out our very extensive salary and job satisfaction survey
on Network Computing Online at http://techweb.cmp.com/nwc.
A quick word on the methodology: In September, we mailed questionnaires
to 1,500 network professionals, randomly sampled from our subscriber
list, and 586 completed the survey. Toppmeyer Research, an
independent research firm, mounted the survey and compiled
the data.

FreeWire: A New Year And Some New Challenges

By:
Bill Frezza

As you have probably read, Network Computing is expanding to
20 issues this year-a testament to the growth of the industry.
This provides a wonderful opportunity to delve more deeply
into favorite subjects as well as explore new ones. I intend
to do both, continuing my coverage of the struggling wireless
data industry while branching out into what I am convinced
will be the decade's most significant trend in computing and
telecommunications-Public Network Computing.

Fellow columnist Timothy Haight, in the August 1, 1995, issue,
identified Public Network Computing as the fifth wave in the
evolution of the computer industry. The first three waves have
become the stuff of history-mainframes, minicomputers and PCs.
Mark Stahlman, former analyst at Alex Brown & Sons and former
columnist for this magazine, is generally credited with identifying
the fourth wave-network computing-forecasting the dynamic growth
of workstations as they broke from the PC model and the LAN
as it became the essential nervous system of corporate America.

Public Network Computing-the extension of distributed computing
outside the enterprise conjoined with networks of other public
and private entities-is ready to take center stage in the lives
of the people who read this magazine. Public Network Computing
will be as different from today's telecommunications and computing
environments as PCs and servers were to dumb terminals and
minicomputers.

The first thing you'll notice is that the rigid demarcation
between public and private facilities will blur as IS managers
reach across town and across continents with new network configuration
and control capabilities. As this happens, the transport elements
of the public infrastructure will be forced to unbundle, after
which they will fragment, commoditize and then take off on
a new round of exponential growth. Simultaneously, a new driving
factor and large element of uncertainty will be introduced
into the mix, namely the consumer. Long fenced off behind antiquated
local telephone networks, this PC- and credit card-equipped
change agent will charge onto the Public Network Computing
scene just as corporations are trying to find new ways to reach
both customers and their employees.

Creative Destruction

Squatting in the middle of all this is the venerable Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The PSTN is a highly tuned,
monolithic, application-specific switching system that today
is tightly bundled with enormous quantities of generic transport.
Its design principles evolved over the course of 100 years,
the last 60 of which occurred in a rigid and protected market.
Most important, the massive central office switches that control
call processing, routing and billing-special purpose mainframes,
really-are architected around underlying traffic models that
have barely changed in decades.

Similarly, the business models that support the financing, deployment
and operation of the PSTN have been frozen by Public Utility
Commissions. Their main purpose is to protect and preserve
the status quo while pandering to their political constituencies,
namely the local Bell Operating Companies and their stockholders.
Investment decisions are based on large upfront capital expenditures
and guaranteed long-term cost recovery. This is accomplished
in highly mature markets with no competitive uncertainty, no
substitution of services and no obsolescence that isn't carefully
planned. This economic model has had an enormous impact on
both system architectures and corporate cultures.

Truth be told, the PSTN is very, very good at what it was designed
to do, just as mainframes did an admirable job of batch processing
the payroll. The fact that the phone network can do anything
else at all, like support fax and circuit switched data, is
a complete accident made possible because this other traffic
was disguised to mimic the parameters of a voice call. This
is hideously inefficient, but if the computer industry had
waited for the phone companies to figure out how to provide
data services rather than go ahead and invent analog modems
that are really voice-call spoofers, we would all still be
computing in splendid isolation.

There is actually an important lesson here. The more the phone
companies try to hold back the tide of Public Network Computing,
forcing customers to live with bundled switching and transport,
as well as tariff structures and business models that are hopelessly
out of date, the more surely phone companies will be rendered
obsolete. Just watch the major Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
like PSI, UUNet and Netcom frantically laying down track, building
depots and switching centers in every city and town. The traffic
that their local Points of Presence (POPs) are bleeding away
from the PSTN may not represent much volume today, but it could
account for most of tomorrow's growth.

Oddly enough, the underlying transport the ISPs use is exactly
the same transport used by the phone companies-after all, a
DS3 line is a DS3 line. The difference is that this transport
is configured to provide application-independent services with
a high degree of modularity and a presumption of distributed
intelligence. None of the applications that the ISPs are chasing
are mature, forecastable or readily characterizable. (Heck,
many of them probably aren't even real.) But, flexibility allows
them to bet on the aggregate. Both the ISPs and Competitive
Access Providers (CAPs), to a certain extent, are learning
to optimize business against a moving target with no guaranteed
rate of return, no decades-long cost recovery and every possibility
that a substitute service can come along tomorrow and take
their business away. Just think how fierce this makes both
their system architectures and their management team.

Now, imagine these two together in a competitive market. In
the Darwinian struggle that looms ahead, the PSTN can be compared
with the marsupials of Australia: highly evolved to fill a
protected environmental niche. The Internet is a wild predatory
mammal, let loose by a massive wave of immigrants that have
little knowledge or concern for the native flora and fauna.
Take a wild guess which is going to kick butt when the last
barriers to competition come down.

Ah, but can't the PSTN always retreat to its lair and live off
voice traffic? Don't be so sure about that. Internet phone
is being scoffed at as an oddity by the phone companies, but
you can bet that at the very least it will massively destabilize
the international long distance tariff structures. Only an
idiot is going to pay $35 an hour for international long distance
a few years from now. Network arbitrage-the ability to use
application-independent switching systems on top of commodity
transport to undercut application-specific bundled and tariffed
services-will become a big game in the age of Public Network
Computing.

Summing It Up

So, putting it all together, what are the top 10 defining technical
and business characteristics of Public Network Computing? 1)
Competitive yet compatible application-independent switching
connected with commodity transport; 2) Distributed intelligence
flexibly accommodating ever-changing traffic models; 3) Modular
deployment aimed at hot markets, unencumbered by social mandates
to guarantee "Universal Service"; 4) Incremental provisioning
with lower first-costs, shorter amortization periods and a
rate of capital equipment turnover closer to the PC industry
than the telecom industry; 5) Destabilizing network arbitrage
that will do more to dissolve the Public Utility Commissions'
cozy little club than any act of Congress; 6) A high rate of
new market entry, and a correspondingly high rate of mergers
and failures; 7) Massive trauma and angst as the local Bell
Operating Companies are forced to cut the dividend, break the
bloated unions and toss out their old-boy, brain-dead management
as they struggle to reinvent themselves; 8) A mind-boggling
array of choices for businesses and consumers; 9) A massive
increase in aggregate telecommunications traffic; and 10) Virtual
integration of selected pieces of all of this under the control
of the enterprise. What a great time to be a Networkologist!

So boot up, tune in and let's watch the game. (I forgot to mention
that the advent of Public Network Computing will also provide
full employment for cheeky commentators.) While I will continue
to bring you FreeWire in each issue of Network Computing, I
have also begun writing biweekly op-ed pieces on technology,
culture and politics for our sister publication, CommunicationsWeek.
In addition, CMP Interactive recently launched a Web service
called TechWeb Gurus in which I am participating. You can visit
us at http://techweb. cmp.com/gurus/gurus.html and put in your
two cents. I've posted a wireless data directory online so
you can get phone numbers and Internet contact information
for any company ever mentioned here. I will also be leading
an ongoing series of interactive debates and dialogue on issues
central to the industry.

So come on by. As the saying goes, I'll see you on the Net.

Corporate View: Businet: A Call To Arms Within The Internet

By:
Robert Moskowitz

I have had the opportunity to view the Internet phenomenon from
both inside and out. In the annals of computing, the Internet
has no parallel for us to turn to for comparison or guideposts.
However, like every major computing innovation, it is yet another
double-edged sword.

While many of you at the very least have dipped your toes in
the Internet by creating a Web server of generally available
information about your company, most of you are holding off
on more involved usage of the Internet. Why are you holding
off? Probably because you just don't see how it can meet the
business demands of performance, reliability, management and
security.

Even the word "Internet" is a source of concern. For the Internet
is, in truth, a collection of large sets of interconnected
networks-each separately managed and operated under different
business models. Further, for all practical purposes it seems
impossible to accomplish anything meaningful over the Internet
that will give your company a competitive advantage that will
not require you to use a significant part of this inter-network.
Seeing this from the business perspective, you wonder how can
business criteria be imposed on such an internetwork that lacks
a central body to listen to the needs of business and to get
its various units to adhere to these criteria?

I am constantly hearing that since there is no central authority,
the Internet is not ready for business use. Just recall your
worst nightmare of a leased-line circuit: your Regional Bell
Operating Company (RBOC) for local connection; a long-haul
carrier into another RBOC; perhaps a bypass carrier for some
tariff avoidance; finally, the remote RBOC into the branch
office. What did you do for managing this circuit? Now consider
again that on the Internet your packets are at the mercy of
the provider's routing policies. That 10-mile "link" between
your office in north Boston to Harvard University may be routed
through Washington, D.C., through five service providers. To
whom do you turn when performance is worse than a 56-Kbps direct
link and no part of your visible path is less than T3?

A Diamond in the Rough

As long as the business community continues to wring its collective
hands about the lack of control on the Internet, there will
continue to be little or no control. If the business community
sidesteps the Internet, it will continue to be designed for
its consuming public. Some corners will work well, but the
main will be mediocre. It's time for us to visualize the Internet
as a rough-hewn gem and play the role of the gem cutter.

A four-phase approach can result in a "businet" that exists
within the Internet. The first and foremost process is to publish
a set of business criteria for performance, reliability and
management. This criteria set will need to be a living document
to be tuned as we learn. The best source for this document
is each of our respective trade organizations, working as much
in concert as time will permit. Once these criteria are known,
a certification process for the service providers is finally
possible, based preferably on ISO-9000.

This certification must be administered by an organization trusted
by the business community and preferably recognized by the
service providers and the various national governments. If
none of the current organizations can step up to the task,
the business community can create such a company to look out
for their interests. With all of my involvement in the Internet
operation and standards efforts, I have not found any existing
structure for this certification. Thus, the selection or creation
of an "Internet Quality Association" is the second phase.

A one-time certification of conformance to a criteria set via
ISO-9000 is obviously inadequate. The third phase is the creation
of a service provider monitoring and reporting system run by
our "IQA." This reporting should work much like the FAA's airline
performance metrics. There's nothing like a quality mirror
to whip an industry into shape. Through this monitoring effort,
the IQA could also function as a "court of last resort" for
the service providers and their customers to resolve compliance
issues before real litigation is needed.

Finally, security is needed. The fourth phase would be to standardize
a set of security methodologies. The standards community is
finally making headway, but we businesspeople have to demand
these in products, from IP Security Protocol (IPSP) up through
MIME Object Security Standard (MOSS). They all play a role
and need to be available in every part of the world on all
platforms. Sophisticated two-way authentication for business
interactions is also needed. These may be the best defense
from spoofing attacks that have the security consensus tied
up in knots. Current efforts for secure Web usage are only
a small part of the overall picture.

Ante Up

All of this will cost lots of money to get started. The value
returned on this investment is the creation of the extended
enterprise for whatever enterprise is envisioned at any given
point in time. The funding model for this work may actually
be more challenging than the actual implementation of a business
quality network within the Internet. The certification fees
and security registry fees can be used to offset some costs,
but they cannot be expected to foot the bill fully. Note that
security registry fees amount to network membership fees. Government
funding has a place for any research efforts needed. The most
noteworthy effort is the development of meaningful metrics
for a service provider. For the most part, we should not look
to any government for funding help any more. If we want to
run it ourselves, we need to fund it ourselves.

So do some soul searching. If you're interested in really creating
an extended enterprise, it's time to roll up your sleeves and
get in there.

Novell XTD: Message To The Wise

By:
Barry Gerber

Novell's GroupWise division presents a new student to the class
of client/server messaging systems-GroupWise XTD. Similar to
the current shipping version of GroupWise (v4.1), which does
not have a client/server architecture, GroupWise XTD continues
to perform e-mail, calendaring, scheduling and connectivity
tasks. Building upon these capabilities, XTD adds a noteworthy
set of system administration and management tools, and an impressive
workflow application development environment. It also has a
well-integrated multifunction client that includes full document
management capabilities and a brilliant front end for phone
conferences. Despite its heavy dependence on NetWare, XTD goes
straight to the head of the class.

GroupWise XTD implements full client/server functionality. GroupWise
v4.1 let clients write to the messaging database through a
server process. However, clients must read from the database
directly through a mapped drive.

XTD runs on top of NetWare 3.x and 4.1 and supports TCP/IP clients,
on-server rules, cross-directory synchronization and public
folder replication. Novell promises XTD servers for Windows
NT Server and seven different Unix flavors, but has not yet
determined when these implementations will be delivered. In
addition, it is still deciding if XTD should support IPX/SPX.

Still, XTD is heavily NetWare-oriented. Its messaging system
directory must be stored in a NetWare 4.1 NetWare Directory
Services directory. You can learn about the health of the XTD
server and other components via reports generated through Novell's
NetWare Management System (NMS). Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) agents also will be available.

Impressive Applications XTD has an impressive workflow application
development environment, which uses a basic implementation
of FileNet's WorkFlo product. Not only can you use the XTD
database or third-party databases to develop messaging-enabled
applications, but also you can use XTD's replication capabilities
to distribute applications to other servers and users. You
can also replicate database records so that everyone using
the database can see new records as they are created. XTD's
workflow development environment may give Lotus Notes a run
for the money.

NetWare 4.1 Climbs To New Heights With SMP

By:
Jay Milne

As an application server, NetWare has been geared mostly toward
workgroup applications but not enterprisewide applications
because of its single processor design-until NetWare 4.1 SMP.
While I ran a beta version on a hefty Compaq ProLiant 4500
with four Pentium 100s and 300 MB of RAM, I was unable to test
many of NetWare 4.1 SMP's capabilities because no applications
were available. However, it promises to let current uniprocessor
systems that are running databases or other CPU-intensive applications
scale and reach higher performance levels without a major architectural
change.

NT and some of the Intel-based Unix systems have implemented
SMP for quite some time. While we don't think NetWare 4.1 SMP
will take any customers away from other SMP operating systems,
it will breathe additional life into NetWare. Certainly it
will benefit those users who have run out of steam with NetWare's
uniprocessor architecture.

By the time NetWare 4.1 SMP is released, only a few SMP-enabled
applications will be on the market. Oracle plans to release
Oracle for NetWare SMP as NetWare SMP ships, and Sybase has
announced plans to ship System 11 for NetWare SMP sometime
in the first half of 1996. Novell should ship GroupWise for
SMP early this year, but internal NetWare 4.1 facilities like
NDS and internal routing will not be SMP-enabled initially.
Unfortunately, that decision will hamper the scalability of
a single NetWare server with a large number of users and a
large NDS tree.

Price for the SMP add-on is set by OEMs. NetWare 4.1 SMP comes
with a license for up to four CPUs (additional CPU licenses
in bundles of four cost extra). No pricing on additional CPUs
was available at press time.

Does Increased Scalability Move Mountains? NetWare 4.1 SMP is
similar to NetWare 4.1, except for a second kernel that handles
and executes SMP threads on all processors. You'll need a Platform
Specific Module (PSM) file (the layer of software that interacts
with the SMP hardware and NetWare) from your hardware vendor
because of the different ways hardware vendors implement SMP.
Having the latest NetWare 4.1 network card drivers is important
to maintain system stability. I got NetWare SMP up and running
within 30 minutes, and SERVER.EXE was updated to handle the
SMP functions.

If you're only using NetWare as a file and print server and
running some utility NLMs, the SMP functionality won't do you
much good. If your applications aren't multithreaded and haven't
been written to take advantage of SMP, NetWare SMP won't be
much help. CPU-bound applications, such as database applications,
will really benefit from SMP. While the operating system of
choice for large, enterprise databases is still Unix, NetWare
4.1 SMP and an SMP-enabled database will let users with existing
databases scale without changing operating systems or hardware
architectures.

Worrying that NetWare 4.1 SMP will break your existing NetWare
applications is a legitimate concern. But because the current
kernel hasn't been replaced and all of the non-SMP applications
continue to run on processor 0, these applications should run
well. We were successful in running several existing applications,
but with any new operating system, make sure to do in-depth
compatibility tests.

Lotus Notes 4 Throws Down Messaging Gauntlet

By:
Barry Gerber

If you liked Notes 3, you're going to love Notes 4. It retains
Notes 3's client/server messaging features, including the single
object store. Notes 4 introduces better administrative and
application development tools, an improved user interface,
great support for mobile computing, more scalability and impressive
Internet integration (for more information on Notes 3, see
the feature story "Client/Server Electronic Messaging: Delivering
the Enterprise," November 15, 1995, page 68)

Notes 4 is due out at press time, which will give it a jump
on Microsoft Exchange Server. At this point, I find Exchange
Server easier and more intuitive to manage. I'm very partial
to Exchange Server's tight integration with NT Server's security
system, which makes a lot of administrative and management
tasks more automatic.

I installed a test release of Notes 4 over an existing Notes
3 installation, using a Windows NT server and the Windows95,
NT and 3.11 clients. A Macintosh client was also included.
Although Lotus couldn't provide schedules at press time, Notes
4 eventually will run on the same wide range of server and
client platforms as Notes 3.

Notes 4 is totally compatible with Notes 3 clients and applications.
I had no trouble accessing my Notes 4 server with a Notes 3
client, or running applications built for a Notes 3 environment
on a Notes 4 client. This makes migration from Notes 3 to Notes
4 a more civilized experience.

The new BASIC-like LotusScript 3.0 is compatible with Microsoft's
Visual Basic and ODBC standards, and can be used to develop
many applications that, under Notes 3, required the Notes API,
a great deal of C programming and a vast amount of third-party
vendor development tools. I had no difficulty building little
test applications with LotusScript. Because LotusScript programs
are embedded in the native Notes programming environment, you
can distribute them during standard Notes database replication.

Knockout Admin Apps

Notes 3 didn't have the most user-friendly administrative tools.
My memory, endurance and patience were sorely tested every
time I had to search for the magic combination of menu options
required to configure a server or its connections, or bring
a new user into the world of Notes 3. Notes 4 changes that
with a simple tree-view window for administering anything from
servers and local and wide area connections, to the master
address book database for a Notes organization. This holds
configuration information about users, groups, servers, server
connections and address books, and you can delegate administrative
rights for managing specific servers to any Notes user.

To pick the object class I wanted to administer (People, Server
and so on), I just clicked on it in the left pane of the address
book.  This transforms the address book into a tool kit for
administering the object class.  To add a new user to the
organizational address book, I clicked on "People" in the tree
and the window is transformed into the one you see in the screen
capture.  When I clicked on the Add Person button, the New Person
form appeared and I filled it in to configure my new user.  The
master address book interface is quite similar to the
Administrator program for Microsoft's Exchange Server, although I
prefer Exchange's tabbed property pages to Notes 4's all-at-once
forms.

I never liked Notes 3's client user interface. Notes 4 menus
and Lotus' Smarticons are better organized and labeled. Both
are context sensitive, changing as the task you're performing
changes. I especially like the second level of larger icons,
like the ones for specific e-mail functions. The real UI improvement
in Notes 4 comes with the incorporation of cc:Mail's drag-and
drop folder pane.

Notes' already noteworthy remote access capabilities are greatly
improved in Notes 4. Notes 3's ability to replicate databases
to portable PCs and keep these replicas in sync has made it
a favorite of road warriors. I discovered that Notes 4 brings
even more goodies. Replication is easier with a new graphically
oriented user interface, and field level (as opposed to full
document level) replication reduces replication times when
only a small part of a document has changed. Encryption protects
locally stored databases.

To save money and/or allow a single point of contact to an organization's
Notes system, Notes 4 supports what is called "pass-through."
This mechanism lets a remote client access its home server
by connecting to any Notes 4 server in an organization and
passing through it and any other Notes 4 servers on the network
path to its home server. Pass-through is also available to
LAN-connected Notes users.

Notes 4 will be a highly scalable client/server messaging system.
According to Lotus, Notes 3 can handle approximately 200 users
per server and Notes 4 supports up to 1,000 users per server.
Some of this increased scalability is because of performance
improvements, such as field level database replication, while
some is attributable to improvements in hardware and operating
systems, like Notes 4's ability to run on higher-end computers
with multiple processors. Notes 4 has also been optimized for
32-bit operating systems.

Notes 4 addresses are stored in X.400 format. X.400 and SMTP
message transfer agents will be available separately for Notes
4 servers. The Notes API is fully supported in Notes 4, along
with MAPI and the X.400-based Common Mail Calls API. MAPI support
goes quite deep. I could access my Notes 4 mailbox with a beta
Exchange client for Windows 3.11. I did have to install the
massive Notes and Exchange clients on my computer, but it worked.

Notes 4 comes with its own integrated World Wide Web browser
for your surfing convenience. Notes 4 documents can include
hypertext links not only to other Notes documents but to Web
pages, so you can build applications that integrate data from
Internet sources.

Single Object Store Remains In Notes 4



One of Notes' real strengths exists in its support of an object
store that holds structured RDBMS-like data, unstructured open
ended data and message routing information.  Although you give up
some performance by including all data in one store, you gain
easier administration, maintenance and especially application
development.  Only Oracle's Oracle Office comes close to Notes in
this regard.

The Riches Of Switches -- 12 Affordable, Fast, High-Qualilty
Ethernet Switches Under $250 Per Port

By:
Robert J. Kohlhepp

Ethernet switches aren't literally a dime a dozen, but the suggestion
fits. We set our threshold at $250 per port and found plenty
of takers. Whether you're setting up a new workgroup or adding
a little bandwidth to an existing one, there's probably an
affordable switch here for you. There may even be a couple
that could slip into the enterprise category-just because they're
cheap doesn't mean they lack critical features. Within this
pack you'll find everything from basic, no-frills switches
to those with VLAN support, protocol filtering, SNMP management,
high-speed uplinks and RMON support.

We tested the following 12 switches in our University of Wisconsin
labs: SMC EZ Switch-6x and TigerSwitch XLE; 3Com LinkSwitch
1000; NetVantage NV7500 Ethernet Switch; Black Box Ethernet
Switch LB9500A; Amber Wave Systems AmberSwitch; CrossComm EWS;
Cisco Catalyst 2100 and Catalyst 1700; D-Link DES-604 four
port 10BASE-T Switching Hub; Matrox Piranha SwitchNIC-10/8;
and FORE Systems ForeRunner ES-3810 Ethernet Workgroup Switch.

Our first concern was performance, but we also found MAC address
and protocol filters very useful in taking control of our network.
VLAN support is also beneficial since it helps segment the
network without further investment. Products that can manage
these features over the network are optimal.

In such a low-cost scenario, we thought we'd be hard pressed
to differentiate between these products. We were wrong. 3Com's
LinkSwitch 1000 offers the best all-round bargain with great
throughput, good management software and a redundant power
supply. SMC's TigerSwitch XLE offers excellent control over
traffic filtering, securing ports and VLAN setup. It also includes
the unique ability to forward defined packets between VLANs.
Avoid the SMC EZ Switch-6x: It has serious performance problems.

NetVantage NV7500 had the best entry price, without giving up
fast uplinks or manageability. For NetWare-only workgroups,
Matrox offers its Piranha SwitchNIC's eight 10BASE-T ports
at an amazing $1,300-on a PCI NIC, no less. Look to Amber Wave,
FORE and CrossComm for flexible, slotted systems. CrossComm's
EWS is a strong product with excellent management software.
Finally, Cisco's Catalyst 2100, a remnant of Cisco's recent
Grand Junction purchase, only lacks a graphical management
interface, which should be coming early this year.

3Com LinkSwitch 1000

3Com's LinkSwitch 1000 has almost everything you could need,
including a redundant power supply option. It excelled in our
throughput testing, successfully passing more packets than
any other switch. 3Com's management software runs on Windows
or almost any flavor of Unix. With a base price that comes
in under $200 per port, including a 100BASE-Tx port, you can't
go wrong, although the LinkSwitch would benefit from ATM support
and VLAN capability-both slated for 1996.

Configuration, as usual, started at the console. Then, using
3Com Transcend Workgroup Manager, we configured nearly every
aspect of the device. Using "port security," we could restrict
each port to serve only statically defined MAC addresses, which
we could enter manually or grab from the real-time display
of active addresses. Using secure learning, we were able to
set the maximum number of addresses allowed on a port. Once
those addresses are learned, no other station can talk on that
port until you reset the switch or change the configuration.

Using the management software or a standard RMON browser (we
used Cabletron's), you can get basic traffic statistics. In
future firmware releases, the LinkSwitch will add more of the
nine RMON groups. FORE and CrossComm offer all nine groups,
but not in their base offerings.

To help control heavy loads, the LinkSwitch can simulate collisions,
using 3Com's Intelligent Flow Control technique, to lower packet
loss. This slows the traffic from the workstations instead
of forcing the switch to drop packets to keep up. This helped
in the short burst situations we saw in our testing. You can
also control broadcast storms by setting limits on the percentage
of broadcast traffic. When the broadcast traffic hits an upper
limit, it can be handled by an alarm (SNMP trap), port disable
or blip (which disables the port and re-enables it in five
seconds)

Although the LinkSwitch supports only 500 addresses in the bridge
table, it is more than enough for any workgroup. The LinkSwitch
would benefit heavily from the workgroup VLAN definitions that
SMC's TigerSwitch has. In fact, the LinkSwitch offers only
basic MAC address filtering. The hardware supports VLANs and
the next revision of software will exploit it.

CrossComm EWS

CrossComm's EWS is an excellent switch that resembles FORE's
flexible slotted configuration. Although it only supports four
addresses per port, with 32 ports it can handle more than 100
stations. It didn't do as well as 3Com's LinkSwitch on performance.
But CrossComm adds IMS-a strong management application that
performed well for us. It can also run under HP OpenView (3Com's
Transcend runs on others). IMS has an excellent graphical interface
to switch statistics and configuration.

You set the basic IP and SNMP community names using the console,
and then you can configure the EWS remotely. CrossComm offers
MAC address security on all ports, as well as static entries
in the bridge address table (BAT) for basic filtering. Like
3Com and FORE offerings, the EWS offers secure learning, so
it can learn the first four addresses talking on a port and
lock out all others.

The device is fully manageable using IMS, from configuring the
MAC addresses that can talk on a port to viewing statistics
in graphical format. By clicking on a port, we could view the
active stations on a port and allow or deny them access. Like
the FORE box, we could also disable the transmitter or receiver
on individual ports for troubleshooting.

Since a switch sends traffic only to the target port, it is
difficult to use a protocol analyzer. The EWS, like Fore, Cisco
and Amber Wave products, allows "port mirroring," which defines
an "analyzer port." Any port's traffic can be "mirrored" to
the analyzer port. Another solution is to buy a more expensive
version of the switch that supports the full nine RMON groups.

SMC TigerSwitch XLE

SMC has greatly improved its switch line with the TigerSwitch
XLE, which now supports Fast Ethernet uplink ports (the XL
didn't). Although it just squeezes under our price ceiling,
the features may be worth it. Flexibility in port configuration,
bridge table management and excellent VLAN support make this
switch a good choice for any environment. SMC covers a wide
range of management platforms, but its Windows management software,
EliteView, has a very difficult time with large networks.

SMC offers a very flexible architecture that can secure addresses
on a per-port basis, add packet filters to control traffic
and "trunk" many ports to another TigerSwitch. With port security,
you can allow only certain MAC addresses to use a port. Packet
filters can be used to grant or deny certain MAC addresses
or protocols from being used on a port. And SMC's unique trunking
scheme connects up to eight ports to another TigerSwitch, aggregating
throughput between them.

Using workgroup definitions in conjunction with protocol and
address filters yields VLANs or virtual workgroups. Ordinarily
VLANs are completely segregated networks and pass no traffic
between them (without the help of an external router or bridge).
But SMC went a step further by letting predefined traffic pass,
based on protocol type, MAC addresses or other bit patterns.
We were able to configure two individual NetWare workgroups.
To give both groups access to our POP mail server (which is
in one group), we added a filter to pass IP traffic between
the groups. No other switch we tested has this kind of flexibility.

Configuring the TigerSwitch is quite simple through a command
line terminal session. Once the IP address is configured, all
management can take place from EliteView. However, EliteView,
by default, tries to manage your whole network. You limit the
scope of discovery by editing text files, which isn't a very
clean approach. Once our network discovery finished, the management
station (a Pentium 60) ran quite slow, finding it difficult
to manage all the data from our huge network (more than 150
subnets). EliteView also had difficulty identifying our routers,
which is crucial in the network discovery process. You may
want to step up to SMC's HP OpenView software component.

Cisco Catalyst 2100

As the Catalyst 1700's big brother, the 2100 offers a couple
extra features, not the least of which is multiple MAC addresses
per port. Using a terminal (there is no graphical tool), the
switch is very configurable, offering VLAN support, multiple
switching methods (cut-through, store-and-forward and fragment
free), and, unique to Cisco, multicast registration. This switch
pushes the $250 per port limit and could use better management
software, but it is flexible and has plenty of features.

Supporting 2,048 addresses, or optionally 8,192, your network
should never outgrow the bridge table-although it will outgrow
the management, which is simply a MIB definition. Cisco plans
to integrate management in 1996. Using a terminal or telnet
session, we were able to set security to allow only certain
addresses on particular ports; and we could define VLANs, although
Cisco should implement some packet filters that would allow
certain packets to pass between them, like SMC has done.

Cisco also lets you prevent unnecessary traffic on ports using
port configuration and multicast registration. Since multicast
addresses cannot be learned, they are usually flooded to all
ports. By configuring multicast registration through the terminal,
you can define which ports receive which multicasts.

FORE Systems ForeRunner ES-3810 Ethernet Workgroup Switch

FORE Systems is certainly no stranger to switching, and its
ForeRunner is no disappointment. A flexible chassis design
accepts more than the Ethernet modules we tested, including
ATM and an SNMP agent with all nine RMON groups. We received
none of these modules in the unit we tested. Like CrossComm's
EWS, ForeRunner is limited to four addresses per port. Filtering
and VLAN support are missing, and the network management module
was absent in the unit we tested, making the ForeRunner pricey
for its features.

The switch we tested consisted of the chassis and one 16-port
switch card. That starts at about $230 per port, but as you
add cards, the cost per port goes down quickly. Performance
ranked right along with the rest, and six wire-speed streams
were not a problem. You can configure one port as an uplink
port, and it will serve as the outlet for packets of unknown
destination.

Using the terminal configuration menu system, we could view
and change aspects such as full/half duplex, uplink port designation
and port mirroring. For troubleshooting, the ForeRunner also
lets you shut off the transmit and receive portions of the
port independently. For more features, FORE offers the inband
SNMP agent module for the chassis and still squeezes in under
the $250-per-port limit.

Amber Wave Systems AmberSwitch

Flexible configuration and cool design make this a fashionable
hub-and it compares well with the products we tested in terms
of its speed and its ability to grow (by filling the slotted
chassis). Although the eight-port configuration is quite high
at $250 per port, a full chassis drops to around $170 per port.
This no-frills switch, using a unique Digital Signal Processor
(DSP) design for controlling the bridge, leaves the door open
for adding new features, such as VLANs, using a simple software
update. Management, currently only a MIB definition, should
improve with the pending introduction of Amber Wave's Windows
management software. For now, lack of RMON, management software,
VLAN support and fast uplinks makes the AmberSwitch high on
potential but mediocre on today's list.

The terminal port let us view the current learned address table
and configure the bridging method on each port, including Amber's
"Adaptive" method. The Adaptive method uses cut-through switching,
but changes to store-and-forward switching if fragmented packet
rates rise. Then, once error rates subside (a configurable
threshold), it reverts back to cut-through switching. Port
mirroring will be included in the next revision, according
to Amber Wave.

The AmberSwitch grows by adding more eight-port card to its
five-slot chassis. It can grow to a total of 32 ports; the
first slot is taken up by the management agent. Soon, Amber
Wave will offer a two-port, 100BASE-Tx module as well. This
works well in the switched Ethernet market, but don't plan
on any ATM uplinks in this switch.

Amber's switching engine uses a hierarchical approach to managing
the address table. Individual cards keep a copy of the table,
and switch based on that table. When new addresses are seen
on a port, that information is passed to a master DSP in the
chassis, which maintains a master copy of the table. It inserts
the entry and replicates the table to all the cards. Using
a DSP is fast enough and lets AmberWave add more features with
simple software updates-and it costs less than a general-purpose
CPU.

Matrox Piranha SwitchNIC-10/8

Matrox cleverly built this fast PCI card-based switch to increase
bandwidth in existing NetWare workgroup servers. Although it's
a bit fickle about bus speed and offers no traffic filtering,
the entry price of $165 per port makes this a very attractive
switch for workgroups. In addition to being an eight-port workgroup
switch, it provides 80 Mbps throughput to the server. Like
the AmberSwitch, it lacks many of the crucial features-VLAN
support, filters, fast uplinks-that other products have.

Although Matrox reports that the Piranha operates slower on
a 30-MHz PCI bus (it prefers 33 MHz), in our testing, it still
performed as well as the standalone switches without loading
the server at all. Matrox's management application, Guardian
Manager, while only offering the most basic information, adds
a nice graphical interface for browsing.

Installation is quick, if you are familiar with NIC installation
under NetWare. We had TCP/IP and IPX/SPX working on the card
in a matter of minutes. However, with AppleTalk bound to the
board, we couldn't see the host server on the network. After
a driver update from Matrox, AppleTalk worked to the server
as well.

Guardian Manager, which runs under HP OpenView (for Windows),
offers an excellent graphical look into the Piranha card. However,
every time we tried to get the interface working, the initial
queries would crash our server. Matrox engineering found a
bug when using SNMP over TCP/IP, and sent a fix. Apparently
Matrox had only tested IPX. Once up and running, we were able
to view the port statistics and address tables. Ports can be
enabled or disabled, or switched to full duplex. All of this
can be done at the NetWare console, using Matrox's console
configuration utility.

NetVantage NV7500

At the top of the pack of small switches (eight ports and under),
NetVantage offers a great switch with slots for fast uplinks.
At $200 per port, it's a bit steep for the few features it
has, but at an entry price of $1,600, you can hardly go wrong.
Unlike some of the others, NetVantage offers a graphical interface
to the basic SNMP agent. However, configuration and maintenance
is very basic, with no support for advanced features, such
as RMON or filtering.

With an agent that's identical to the Black Box switch, the
NV7500 provides the same type of information and configuration.
However, NetVantage offers a graphical interface to the basic
MIB II statistics under HP OpenView, complete with a graphical
representation of the hub. It would be advantageous to add
the ability to manipulate the static filter entries through
the graphical interface, however.

The basic model is just an eight-port Ethernet switch, but NetVantage
ships a 100BASE-Tx uplink port. Although its FDDI module is
not due until early next year, IP fragmentation is already
built in. ATM modules are planned for 1996 as well.

Cisco Catalyst 1700

Because of its meager one address per port, the Catalyst 1700
is probably the most workgroup-oriented switch of the bunch.
But if you use its uplink port, you can connect it to the enterprise.
This switch, while short on management software (there are
no graphical tools) and packet filtering features (there's
no VLAN support), offers not only private Ethernet, but two
Fast Ethernet uplinks for connection to the server or campus
backbone at just under $160 per port. It's a solid, inexpensive,
no-frills workgroup switch.

Through a terminal menu system, we were able to configure the
port security and view statistics about traffic on them. You
can set the ports to bridge store-and-forward, fragment free,
or, as 3Com calls it, fast forward (cut-through to most). Port
mirroring is also available.

The Catalyst 1700 is a fixed-configuration switch with two Fast
Ethernet ports for servers. So, don't expect to upgrade this
with any other fast ports, such as ATM or FDDI. You will need
to move up to Cisco's Catalyst 2800 (which was not tested here
because it exceeded our price point) to get that added functionality.
Like the 2100, this switch will benefit from management under
CiscoWorks.

Black Box Ethernet Switch LB9500A

Keeping up with the big switches doesn't seem to be a problem
for this very basic switch, although Black Box's $250 per port
is high. Other than an optional redundant power supply, there
are no expansion slots for modules like high-speed ports. Basic
SNMP is included, but Black Box would benefit from a graphical
management tool like NetVantage's, rather than a simple MIB
definition (which didn't compile anyway)

Using a terminal to connect to the console, we were able to
configure the IP address of the bare-bones SNMP agent. Beyond
that, there was little to configure. Configuring bridging allows
for static address entries, which you can add manually or through
the listing of currently active addresses. We were able to
change the size of the bridge address table. If it's feasible
for your network, a smaller table means faster lookups.

Adding a graphical interface to manage the hub would be a great
improvement. As it stands, we were unable to compile the MIB
under HP OpenView or SunNet Manager. We even tried two different
"corrected" versions of the MIB.

D-Link DES-604 four-port 10BASE-T Switching Hub

With only four ports, this switch needs the help of a hub to
feed a workgroup. Luckily, the ports are designed for that
no crossover cable is necessary. Management is nonexistent,
but performance is better than most. The per port cost of $250
is steep for the features, but for $1,000 you get a cheap entry
into switching. The DES-604 will simply switch Ethernet and
blink LEDs; don't expect any management, filtering or fast
uplinks.

Using a method similar to 3Com's, the DES-604 minimizes lost
packets by "throttling" the input ports. This helps it achieve
a little better performance than the rest of the field, but
a little more buffer space may help it catch up with 3Com.
At more than 2,000 addresses per port, you'll need a new switch
long before the bridge table is full.

SMC EZ Switch-6x

EZ may describe the decision to bypass purchasing this switch.
Complete lack of configuration options, terminal or otherwise,
is only superseded in shortcomings by its absolutely poor performance.
This switch was not only unable to keep up with the others
in two-stream buffering, it couldn't even hold one wire-speed
stream. This is the Corvair of switches: "unsafe at any speed."

At $200 per port, we can't see any market for a switch with
such poor performance. Just pony up the additional $50 per
port for the SMC TigerSwitch or 3Com LinkSwitch and get real
performance and loads of features to boot.

Putting Ethernet Switches To The Test


We tested throughput using Alantec's PowerBits, which can blast
any packet to any switch port and report where it ends up.
We used it to test the switches for up to six sustained streams,
and we tested the ability to buffer and flow control. The PowerBits
was only able to test Ethernet to Ethernet, so we couldn't
test the faster uplinks some switches offered.

Using the PowerBits, we streamed data from two switch ports
to a single port for 10 seconds.

That means we could have up to 20 Mbps headed for a 10-Mbps
outlet. Most switches kept the output port at wirespeed (10
Mbps), but 3Com and D-Link buffered enough to send more after
the input stream halted. They use an effective buffering scheme
that helps under short-term, heavy-load situations.

The throughput testing was not quite complete, since our PowerBits
equipment was capable of only six streams of data (about 90,000
packets per second at 64 bytes). This was just an exercise
in finding out if the vendors were truthful about supporting
wire speed on multiple ports.

We blasted as many streams as possible, depending on the number
of ports available on each switch (only two on D-Link, for
instance) for a duration of 10 seconds. With the exception
of the SMC EZ Switch-6x, all switches could handle wire-speed
quite handily. Less expensive doesn't mean slow.

Classic Bridges vs. Switches



Although externally these switches appear to operate as bridges,
they handle ports and bridging tables differently. And they
offer bridging methods other than store-and-forward to reduce
latency. Traditionally, bridges were integral parts of the
network flow. They were expected to know every MAC address,
keep track of paths to those devices and prevent traffic looping
in the network. That isn't quite true anymore.

Workgroups or buildings are attached to the backbone through
the switch, so there's really only one port that talks to rest
of the world-the uplink port. Since the switch knows addresses
of all of the workstations connected to it, address tables
need only be as large as the number of workstations connected
locally. With classic bridges, packets destined for unknown
addresses are flooded on all ports. Switches know all of the
stations

on its local ports and only flood the uplink port.

Middleware -- Driving Applications On the Network

By:
Bruce Robertson

Middleware is impacting network applications significantly.
Little, however, is understood about specific middleware products
and how they really work, mostly because a deployment and networking
perspective hasn't been used in evaluating middleware. Developers
evaluate middleware from the top down. Often, an application
developer is like the car driver who doesn't really want to
know how the car operates or is maintained. They just want
to drive it. They really only touch the steering wheel and
the pedals. A thorough perspective requires understanding middleware
from the bottom up, from the inside out and over time. Experienced
drivers know that a car has to be maintained, that some cars
work better on some roads than others and that an educated
driver is less likely to have accidents or breakdowns. While
the developer still does the network application driving, consulting
with a qualified network application mechanic will improve
the life of the application.

From the Driver's Seat Programmers essentially define middleware
by its Applications Programming Interface (API).  They want to
know how to use it.  This top-down view yields a characterization
of products by how they are accessed without necessarily
specifying what they actually do diagram "Middleware
Functionality The API Perspective").  Thinking that two cars are
very different because one is manual while the other is automatic
misses the point that underneath they might be mostly the same.
Nevertheless, these top-down categories are commonly used:

 Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) products

 Remote Procedure Call (RPC)-based products

 Data access products

 Distributed Transaction Processing (DTP) monitor products

 Object Request Broker (ORB) products

Some products, however, provide more than one API, and vendors
are increasingly working together to offer multiple products
layered together as a suite. Each product has chosen a set
of services to offer underneath these APIs, and they are often
remarkably related even if the APIs are different.

MOM systems typically offer a very basic set of commands for
network communication-often as few as SEND and RECEIVE.  We're
not talking about "e-mail" messaging.  MOM products let programs
send data to programs in real time (or slower), while e-mail
infrastructures are still primarily for store-and-forward text
message exchanges between people.

MOM is about as manual, yet as general purpose, as it can get
for the programmer. Application developers create application
specific functions or routines built on these basic messaging
functions. As far as transports go, the interface is even simpler
than programming to a particular network transport API, like
TCP/IP sockets. Many message-oriented products exist, including
Covia Communications Integrator (CI), PeerLogic Pipes, Momentum
XIPC/Message Express, IBM MQSeries, Digital DECmessageQ and
NetWeave, but RDBMS vendors like Oracle and Sybase are getting
into the fray as well with products like Oracle Mobile Agents
and EMS.

RPC-based products are function oriented.  Developers define
their own application-specific functions using an interface
description language (IDL), and then compile that function into
the client and server stub code that actually does the
networking.  The application just makes normal function calls.
Developers essentially create their own APIs.  Many RPC-based
products only generate function stubs for 3GL languages like C,
but some support 4GL products like PowerBuilder.  While many 4GL
tools can call C functions, it is easier if the functions are
tool-specific.  When distributing existing host-based multiuser
applications, the RPC approach is very intuitive:  Each existing
function can be split across the network as needed-just recompile
to distribute a given function.  RPC-based products are fairly
automatic compared with message-oriented solutions.

RPC-based products come from many vendors, which includes Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE) standard vendors such as the major
Unix players (IBM, Digital, Hewlett-Packard and so on, except
Sun), along with Gradient, Open Horizons and others. Sun's
ONC RPC is implemented on many Unix platforms. NobleNet and
NetWise offer third-party products.

Data access products offer data-oriented APIs that reveal data in
tables.  Using a standard API (ODBC), applications get at remote
data using SQL.  However, most RDBMS vendors have proprietary
APIs in addition to ODBC, since those let them directly expose
unique RDBMS functionality.  If the application only needs to
have its data distributed to, and shared from, database servers,
data access works well.  Many tools already support this API, and
since no application specific programming is required on the back
end, it empowers ad-hoc application development.

Here, only the data can be on another node. With all the others,
whole pieces of the overall application can be split across
the network to run on other nodes. While the more recent development
of stored procedures provides some additional program execution
across the network, this is still limited to SQL data manipulation,
and it's RDBMS-specific at that. Besides the big RDBMS vendors
like Oracle (SQL*Net), Sybase (Open Client/Open Server), Microsoft
(DB-Library) and so on, third-party vendors like IBI, TechGnosis
(recently purchased by Intersolv), Cross Access, NetWise (recently
acquired by Microsoft), Neon Systems and many others offer
RDBMS-independent data access products.

DTP monitor products offer a middleware environment oriented
toward handling transactions over a network.  Transaction
monitors add BEGIN and END TRANSACTION semantics to the generic
SEND and RECEIVE.  By using DTP services, the application doesn't
have to include logic to assure transaction integrity.

DTP products are often built on top of message-oriented or RPC
based technology but add significant control and management
functionality. Most DTP vendors are working to implement new
X/Open standard APIs, but today, most have proprietary APIs.
DTP products interact with database resources via the X/A standard
interfaces supported by most RDBMS vendors. Products include
Novell Tuxedo, Transarc Encina, AT&T GIS Top End and IBM CICS.
From the developer's viewpoint, this is a manual transmission
with more gears, but the car has airbags to keep passengers
as safe as possible.

ORB products support network interaction between pieces of an
application with yet another programmer API:  the object Once the
developer starts working in an object-oriented tool (a 3GL, like
C++ or a 4GL), the easiest middleware would directly network the
objects created in the tool.  An ORB just lets the developer of
an application containing many objects easily partition those
objects onto different network nodes.  This is similar to the
RPC-based approach, except for object-oriented tools, not
function-oriented tools.

If the object-oriented developer does not use an ORB, the programming
job will be complicated by having to create the links between
objects and the functions or other APIs offered by the other
middleware solutions. The ORB world has many standards: the
Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA), along with de facto standards like Microsoft's OLE
(which is waiting for Cairo before it gets distributed functionality)
and OpenDOC. Much of CORBA currently defines developer APIs,
although later versions are finally defining services to expose
via the APIs and even some interoperability options. ORBs are
available from large system vendors (IBM SOM/DSOM, HP, Digital,
NEC, AT&T GIS) and many third parties, including Iona (Orbix),
Expersoft (PowerBroker), PostModern (ORBeline) and NeXT.

Some development tools contain middleware components, such as
Fort , Dynasty, Seer and Antares Alliance Group (Huron ObjectStar).
Tool products with built-in middleware can usually be adapted
to use external middleware solutions.

Looking Under the Hood

Beyond hiding things from developers (and thus controlling diversity),
middleware takes care of things developers would normally have
to handle in the application. Middleware provides services,
and can therefore reduce the effort, time and cost required
to implement an application.

Application-oriented network mechanics don't focus so much on
what API a middleware product offers, but on the complex issues
surrounding the actual middleware services-specifically how
they impact the network and scale to the enterprise. Dependencies
and deficiencies often become apparent only during deployment,
just like you might only realize your car is guzzling gasoline
after driving it for a while.

Each middleware product can offer, or decline to offer, many
services across the network, but even if programmers notice
and appreciate them, they still may only see the service as
options in the API, instead of something to be deployed and
maintained. Take name services: Most data access middleware
has a name service that lists the RDBMS servers users can access,
and translates that name into an underlying network address
(an IP address or a DNS host name, for example). That's usually
enough for the programmer; the user will see names.

The networker notices that a given RDBMS' implementation for
naming lookup and address resolution is completely static and
based on tables that have to be manually maintained at each
client node. Only lately have RDBMS vendors offered a more
centralized and dynamic approach-one that is infinitely easier
to deploy and manage over time. The networker might insist
on using these more scalable implementations.

Moreover, each product is a mix of APIs and services, each unique
and possibly right for a particular application environment.
Some products even support multiple APIs and services. NetWeave
and ISIS, for example, support both message-oriented and data
access approaches.

Middleware products can also be layered on top of each another.
Many DCE RPC-based products use DCE's other services (like
directory and security). Open Horizons provides data access
over DCE, while Transarc Encina provides DTP services over
DCE. The Orbix ORB runs on top of other middleware (ISIS).
IBM has announced it will create a service provider API for
SOM/DSOM, so other middleware products like PeerLogic Pipes
can fit underneath.

Middleware Transport Services

Middleware is where the application hits the network. Like different
car models, different middleware products offer a variety of
ways to get the basic transportation job done. The largest
differences come in the model for interacting over the network,
including one-to-one interaction using request/reply conversations
or events, and one-to-many interaction using broadcasts and
publish/subscribe. Underneath those basic interaction models
lurk interesting differences between products.

All middleware supports communication in all directions, except
data access middleware where only clients can initiate conversations
and make requests. Data access interaction also typically places
the largest burden on network bandwidth, since large result
sets can be requested ad hoc by end users.

The typical request/reply model used by network transports,
such as TCP/IP, characterizes most RPC and data access middleware
 Ask a question; wait for an answer. This synchronous blocking
behavior suits procedural applications, where things happen
in a logical order, well controlled by a single code base usually
running on the client. The middleware makes sure that the request
and reply are delivered. Often, the middleware does little,
only passing the message directly down to TCP/IP or another
stack for reliable connection-oriented delivery. Conversations
are set up, data is exchanged and the conversation is torn
down. Such mechanics are most efficient if servers aren't overloaded
and if the client only talks to one server at a time.

Applications, however, are increasingly becoming event oriented.
Effective event orientation means ditching the conversational
model, since events require a more dynamic and flexible model
with lower overhead per interaction: non-blocking asynchronous
communication. Applications can't stop working while waiting
for events. Instead, events just happen.

Asynchronous communication is possible with multithreaded RPCs
(DCE using DCE threads, for example) but has proven much easier
with message-oriented middleware. Many message-oriented solutions
implement their asynchronous behavior by using the underlying
operating system's threads support or deliver it internally
for operating systems that aren't inherently multitasking (like
Windows 3.x). Messaging products like NetWeave and Covia CI
offer synchronous and asynchronous behavior.

So, the great "RPC vs. message-oriented middleware" debate comes
down to this: RPCs and messages really aren't completely distinct
options. They are different sets of services and APIs delivered
in typical packaging combinations. Most RPC implementations
are blocking and synchronous, and therefore not perfect for
distributed event-oriented applications.

An event-oriented application working over an asynchronous middleware
mechanism can exploit the parallelism of a network of resources
by sending off multiple requests to multiple servers up front
and accepting responses as they come back, rather than contacting
one server and waiting to hear back from it before continuing
to the next. User response time would improve since more things
get done at once. This is particularly well oriented to integrating
multiple legacy systems into a single end-user application.

Message-oriented solutions (and this would include ORBs, DTP
products and any other systems built on message-oriented infrastructure)
also typically offer connectionless services. Now, a message
doesn't have to require any response at all, even within the
underlying network transport layers. This is lower overhead
than having the middleware's own non-blocking functionality
implemented over connection-oriented transport protocols. It
does require more data per message to include connection-like
information, but since centralized resources no longer have
to keep up connections, they can be more heavily loaded. MOM
products, like PeerLogic Pipes, offer reliable yet connectionless
services over IP.

When message-oriented interaction is combined with queuing,
applications no longer have to be online at the same time (the
same benefit as with e-mail or voice mail). Clients and servers
can queue up messages for each other, and when an actual connection
is made, the messages are exchanged. Some MOM products work
with in-memory queues for performance, while others support
disk-based queues for reliability. Some, like NetWeave, use
a single queue (for best performance with least latency) while
others, like IBM MQSeries, use two (for highest availability
and reliability). This queued messaging lets applications function
well for the mostly disconnected user over low-speed or wireless
links, as well as for very heavily loaded servers (where the
queue enables session concentration and batch-like processing
typical of mainframe systems)

Most request/reply environments use point-to-point connections.
One device talks to another. A growing number of middleware
products, however, are taking advantage of broadcast and multicast
paradigms. In a stock trading application, for example, people
on a trading floor might want to track the cost of a given
stock on their workstations. A server could send that data
out 50 separate times in 50 separate messages to 50 separate
machines, or the 50 workstations could poll the server separately.
The most efficient way, however, is to broadcast it once and
let them all listen. Multicast is a special case of broadcasting
to more than one, but not all, nodes on the network.

These one-to-many approaches can provide interesting networking
implications, specifically because most routed networks don't
support broadcasting between subnetworks. Multicast may only
be supported on particular datalinks and network transports.
Teknekron's Rendezvous Software Bus, for example, offers extensive
broadcast functionality, for example, letting Microsoft Excel
users publish parts of spreadsheets anonymously for other users
to subscribe to independently over the network along with a
broadcast relay component to move messages across subnetwork
boundaries.

Middleware Transparency Services

A key benefit of middleware is how it hides differences between
deployment environments. Transparency must exist not only across,
but between, lots of different platforms. Take network transparency.
It's not just that the middleware API is simpler than the underlying
transport API, it's that the middleware makes differences between
multiple transports transparent to the application, and makes
for more ongoing deployment and maintenance flexibility.

Beyond transparency, middleware should offer network protocol,
operating system, programming language and even API independence.
Network independence, for example, means that two devices communicating
with each other need not have a single network protocol in
common.

Between operating system platforms, middleware normalizes data
format differences. Some use a single platform-independent
data representation on the wire (like XDR in ONC RPC or ASN.1).
Most let the "receiver make right" any differences, which means
the middleware has to know from which machines messages are
coming, but it still results in less overhead per message while
keeping servers pumping out natively formatted data at their
fastest clip.

Moreover, middleware can hide real differences between different
database systems (by supporting multiple vendor products like
IBI EDA/SQL does) or between different legacy application environments
(by providing procedural access to existing business logic
in CICS transactions, for example). All these resources look
similar to the application running on the client, although
some programming may be required to integrate legacy transactions.

Some applications will want full transparency from middleware
itself. In this case, programmers create their own meta-API.
Applications also gain middleware independence by using three
tier application designs that use different middleware between
different tiers of the application. SAP AG's R3, for example,
uses messaging between desktops and application servers, but
uses data access between application servers and database servers.

Middleware Directory Services

Directory services are a large differentiating factor between
products offering similar APIs, transport and transparency
services. Without some level of naming indirection, changing
service locations (server names or IP addresses, for example)
on the fly will be difficult after the application is deployed
to hundreds or thousands of desktops.

Some middleware products offer no help. Others rely on underlying
network transport-specific mechanisms (like DNS, NetWare SAP
or NetBIOS) for name lookup and address translation. These,
however, aren't consistent across all transports, nor are any
of them perfectly suited to the needs of applications trying
to name components dynamically. Still others offer their own
simple name services or full enterprise scalable naming.

Nowhere is this more pronounced than when comparing DCE RPC
with other RPC implementations. While most RPC products punt
on the naming service issues, DCE RPC is often implemented
with DCE's other services including directory services (cell
directory service) and security (Kerberos with DCE-specific
integration). Moreover, DCE's services are not simple naming
services, but complete authentication and data encryption services
delivered in a scalable way.

Contrast this with PeerLogic's Pipes naming service. Since there's
no security service, Pipes provides only name/address translation
services. Authentication is the application developer's problem.
However, its name service is well optimized for robust distributed
dynamic name services. A service can announce itself via the
directory and users can immediately tell that a new resource
is available. Applications can easily search the name space
for services they need. While it's not infinitely extensible,
the Pipes directory service offers some attribute fields that
can be populated as required for application needs, allowing
the application developer to type and otherwise identify services.

Middleware's use of external directory services can be platform
specific. Oracle, for example, now supports NDS in Oracle 7.2,
but only when the server runs directly on the NetWare platform.
If you need to run Oracle on Unix, you can't authenticate against
NDS.

Directory services enhance their basic location transparency
benefits with associated services like transparent load balancing
across services. Some middleware products offer their own directories
along with other mechanisms for load balancing (Tuxedo and
other DTP products). Reliable messaging products like ISIS
support load balancing. High availability and load balancing
go hand in hand with a good dynamic directory service.

Middleware Security Services

Directories are better deployed in conjunction with security
services designed to support a single system image. This is,
for example, when a user logs in once to the network and no
longer individually logs in over and over again to each application
or server.

Security functionality should include authentication and privacy
(encryption), data integrity and identification (perhaps using
digital signature technology) and non-repudiation (return receipt).
Not many middleware products do this internally, although DCE
does provide directory and security services in addition to
the RPC transport to handle most of these needs. Only recently
has Novell announced that the Tuxedo transaction monitor will
use NDS for directory and security needs (a product called
TransactionLink), but only on the NetWare NLM platform version.

While Kerberos (RFC 1510) seems like the external security system
of choice outside the NOS proprietary implementations, it has
only recently (in V5) supported public-key encryption solutions
like RSA. A new standard API called Generic Security Services
API (GSSAPI, defined in RFC 1508) should make it easier for
non-DCE middleware to use security services such as Kerberos
or any other service that supports that API. Other applications
that do not use the DCE RPC mechanism may still directly authenticate
using Kerberos. Suite Software's SuiteDOME ORB uses message
oriented mechanisms across the wire, but supports Kerberos.

Kerberos, however, isn't perfect. It doesn't, by itself, protect
from password-guessing attacks. Nor does it support hardware
based one-time passcode options like Security Dynamics SecurID.
In contrast, Oracle's Secure Network Services now supports
fingerprint recognition in its SQL*Net data access middleware.

Most middleware products offer no guarantee that authentication
will be done securely. Instead, user names and passwords move
between client/server in open text. Anyone with a network analyzer
could compromise your security. Beyond authentication, data
encryption is usually not offered.

Contrast this stark reality with the enhanced functionality
of some middleware products. DCE RPC-compatible applications
can flip a switch to turn on data encryption. Microsoft SQL
Server 6.0's new DCE RPC-based DB-Library supports both per
node and centralized enforcement. While SQL Server 6.0 uses
the NT domain services and not the DCE directory and security
services, authentication is still secure if you choose either
Named Pipes or DCE RPC transport connections.

Creating applications that access resources separately controlled
by different security systems (DCE, RDBMS, NOS, mainframe and
so on) can make things complex. The different systems must
be separately integrated or gatewayed by the middleware or
the application. Otherwise, users must log in to those resources
separately. Oracle's SQL*Net/DCE provides single system logon
using DCE directory and security while running over the DCE
RPC transport. Open Horizon's Connection offers database access
this way, but to more than just Oracle databases. Novell, in
contrast, has not decided if its Net2000 security services
based on NDS will gateway to DCE or NT domain security. So
far, it has only said it'll synchronize directories with those
systems in the future.

Most middleware products still expect the developer to make
security decisions and address those concerns outside the middleware.
Moreover, security control may need to be focused at many levels
 the conversation, socket or transport level (Kerberos, Netscape's
SSL); the document or message level (SHTTP, secure e-mail solutions
like S/MIME and PEM); or even the transaction level (DTP products,
EDI). A lot still has to be decided as networked applications
move from being deployed over relatively controlled private
networks into public networks where full security is a requirement.

Middleware Fault Tolerance Services

Some middleware is focused squarely on offering high availability
and fault tolerant support for networked applications. For
example, Tandem/ISIS offers fault tolerant message-oriented
solutions for reliable messaging, while Teknekron's similar
publish/subscribe mechanism does not.

Beyond specifically nonstop systems lies middleware designed
to assure transaction integrity despite failures, but without
making the application do all the extra work. An update may
not be made, but at least the middleware makes sure that complex
transactions are fully carried out, or completely backed out.
DTP products offload clients from the two-phase commit processing
that data access products require, and let an event-oriented
application get on with other tasks while complex transaction
processing is taking place elsewhere. DTP products are used
more often than data access middleware when high performance
and complete reliability are paramount. By depending on more
middleware services, applications can be smaller.

Distributed fault tolerant solutions require a naming or full
directory service to provide location transparency for service
providers. Client applications can't have hard-coded service
names or network addresses. They will break when a service
is moved to another machine. Some middleware solutions, such
as PeerLogic Pipes and ISIS, automatically start additional
services on new machines if loads get too high on one server,
or for fail-over if a server becomes unavailable.

For multiple instances of a duplicated service, most middleware
systems will provide some load balancing across them. However,
mechanisms vary from nothing (in PeerLogic Pipes) to a DTP
product's careful analysis of resource platform load.

While some of these differences can seem subtle, if you're driving
the applications on your network, it will pay to understand
how to exploit, deploy and maintain these middleware services.
Not only will you gain a better understanding of how applications
impact your network, you'll be able to steer your application
developers down the right service roads.

The Redeeming Qualities Of Val-Pak's Network

By:
Maureen Zapryluk

Everyone has received an envelope of coupons in the mail, offering
everything from free pizzas to dry cleaner discounts. Behind
these money-saving offers is a high-volume, high-speed network
that pumps out billions of coupons every year. "Twenty-four
hours a day, seven days a week, huge images are floated onto
the network," says Alan Robson, Val-Pak director of IS. Val
Pak Direct Marketing Systems, a cooperative, direct mail advertising
company based in Largo, Fla., has franchises across the U.S.
and Canada. Churning out countless coupons requires two facilities
in Largo-one for administration and one for production-which
are linked by redundant T1s to a graphics facility in Las Vegas.

Val-Pak's network connects 750 system components on an AppleTalk
and IP network. The underlying infrastructure is switched Ethernet,
FDDI and 10BASE-T. Remote users can dial in via Shiva's LanRover
from home or on the road, into 3Com ONcore concentrators and
Cisco routers. An Internet Web site, (http://www.valpak.com),
provides information about Val-Pak and posts test coupons for
market research. Val-Pak uses CE Software's QuickMail for internal
communications. A project to install Windows NT servers and
Windows95 on desktops is being evaluated, which also would
provide Netscape on Macs or PCs for e-mail and internal services.

"Our network goal is achieved when our customers are able to
take access to information for granted," says Robson. To create
a coupon, a sales rep takes an order from a vendor, then decides
what materials are required, some of which may be images stored
on graphics servers or need to be scanned into the system.
The artist designs the ad using Quark on a Mac. The dummy ad
rests on SPARC or Apple Workgroup servers while a four-color
proof is printed. Then it is sent to the sales rep via modem
or FedEx. The ad is then taken off the Rasterizing Image Processing
Server (RIPS) and is transferred to a film plate for printing.

Supporting this process are Sun SPARC 1000E servers that handle
120 GB of graphics applications and photo research databases.
Artists use a graphics application built around a Sybase database
running on a Sun SPARC. Apple Workgroup Servers contain multiple
80 GB of files of various graphics and data: order numbers,
reference files, past artwork, clip art, logos. Others included
are reference applications and Primac's Unidata business database
application. Val-Pak plans to set up individual Web sites for
database access.

"Managing fluctuations in network data traffic is a challenge,"
says Robson. "There are rush periods and low-volume periods.
Production is cyclical. There are short windows to gauge usage

Serving Up HTML Documents On The Web

By:
Scott S. Campbell, Robert J. Kohlhepp and Josh Linder

The World Wide Web is all the rage. It seems that around every
turn on the Internet, a company or organization has a Web presence.
If now is your time to create a presence on the Web, the first
thing you'll have to do is find yourself a server. Whatever
your environment may be, we're sure that one of these servers
will suit you.

To give you a snapshot of what's available, we've taken an in
depth look at 14 Web servers that span the most popular operating
systems and server platforms. We examined Macintosh OS, NetWare,
Unix, Windows 3.1 and Windows NT solutions.

Of the products we tested, the Macintosh-based ones are arguably
the quickest to install and configure, particularly with WebStar
as delivered on Apple's Internet Server Solution. However,
the well-designed installation routines of O'Reilly & Associates'
WebSite are intuitive with clearly thought-out defaults, which
make its installation almost as simple.

In general, Web servers running on one of the Unix operating
systems will be extremely stable and flexible, but these solutions
typically have higher costs associated with their products,
platform and maintenance. Because of the maturity of Unix,
many support tools used with Web servers are readily available
all over the Internet, including scripting, compilers for custom
applications, and precompiled binaries.

All products have a security angle. For example, one advantage
Mac solutions have over most Unix-based products is they don't
automatically index their directories. Hence, users don't have
the opportunity to surf the server's underlying files and directory
structures. Of course, tradeoffs exist. Not indexing directories
automatically means a slight performance hit, which could be
a problem for larger high-volume sites.

If cost cutting is a priority, many Web server options are available.
Solutions, such as NCSA's and W3C's HTTPd, are not only free,
but also can run on an inexpensive server platform, such as
on an Intel machine with Caldera's Linux. Although this solution
is far from maintenance free and will require an administrator
who is familiar with Unix maintenance and configuration, it
does benefit from the features that make Unix a strong, scalable
solution. On the other hand, if you're looking for a turnkey
solution, Apple's Internet Server Solution with WebStar is
one of the easiest solutions around.

Striking a balance among setup, features, maintenance and other
items was a challenge, but, in the end, Purveyor from Process
Software emerged on top. Macintosh-based WebStar from StarNine
fared well, as did WebSite from O'Reilly & Associates.

Process Software Purveyor 1.1a

Process Software's Purveyor 1.1a is the leading contender in
the Windows NT Web server market. Combining easy installation,
good documentation and strong utilities, Process Software's
flagship Internet product is leaps and bounds better than its
1.0 release.

Purveyor runs as a service under Windows NT, and like a number
of the other products in this review, it creates a program
folder with the configuration utilities to ease server management.
Purveyor adds value to Windows NT with features that show its
tight integration with Program Manager. The installation creates
a Purveyor menu and adds seven buttons to the toolbar for complete
control of the server and a Control Panel with service manipulation
options.

Purveyor's well-done documentation consists of three books:
Guide to Server Security, Programmer's Guide and a beefy 209
page User's Guide. The irony is that Process Software's utility
software offering is so easy to use that the extensive documentation
is superfluous. The software is compatible with the standard
CERN HTTPd, so migration of HTML documents, image maps and
CGI scripts is a breeze for Webmasters looking for a change
of server platform. Server configuration and management can
be done locally or remotely using Purveyor's Remote System
Management (RSM) atop a Web browser.

For users who wish to run a Web server under Windows95, Process
offers Process Personal Web Server for Windows95. Like the
NT version, this port is highly integrated with Microsoft's
newest mainstream OS. Look for NetWare and VMS products as
well as a secure version in an upcoming release.

StarNine WebStar 1.2.1

We were very pleased with the simplicity of setting up WebStar,
as StarNine and Apple have chosen to supply this product pre
installed on Apple's Internet Server Solution. As soon as we
took the PowerMac 6150/50 workgroup server out of the box and
powered it up, we could start configuring WebStar and adding
pages for our tests. It was that simple.

Configuration is accomplished via an administration utility,
which provides a simple interface for modifying server features.
Although the provided documentation is a little thin, you can
find detailed technical information on configuring your server
on StarNine's corporate Web pages.

Setting up our pages was very easy, and we were impressed that
we didn't need to make any modifications to page links whose
sources reside in the same directory. On some other server
platforms, such as with GLACI-HTTPD, we routinely had to modify
our image links to reflect where the pages were physically
stored in the directory structure. Hence, if you are supporting
multiple small pages, you can keep all of the relative components
in the same directory and let the server default to local naming
very simple, indeed.

Although not as pervasive as with many of the Unix-based solutions,
CGI support for WebStar is extensive in the third-party domain.
A quick look at StarNine's Web pages provides many sources
of CGI that are modules ready to plug into your WebStar server.
Of course, should that list not cover your specific niche,
you can easily use AppleScript to develop your own CGI application.

StarNine intends to develop both MacHTTP and WebStar products.
They consider MacHTTP to be an entry-level product with which
new administrators can get started. Then as their needs for
power and flexibility grow, administrators can move to WebStar,
which performs approximately four times faster.

O'Reilly & Associates WebSite 1.0d

The first software product from the book publishing giant O'Reilly
& Associates is solid, easy to learn and easy to implement
in a wide variety of scenarios. Although designed for Windows
NT, WebSite runs equally well on Windows95, only requiring
12 MB RAM, which is half the requirement of other NT-based
products.

Since O'Reilly & Associates is primarily a publishing house,
it came as no surprise that WebSite's documentation is of the
highest quality in our entire review. The 325-page Building
Your Own Web Site includes information on every aspect of the
software, and it made implementing every feature simple-even
for a person who has never touched CGI or image map tools.

WebSite is as elegant as it is extremely feature-rich. The two
floppy-disk setup was straightforward and similar to GLACI
HTTPD and the Mac servers, and it asked for minimal configuration
information during its installation. Once installed, WebSite
can be conveniently launched as a service, a service with a
desktop icon or as a desktop application. The strong configuration
utility, which can be run by right-clicking on the server icon,
is easy to use and has several security features.

O'Reilly uses an image mapping technique that's different from
the other products. WebSite stores the actual map coordinates
in the registry; most other products either internally run
an image map applet or perform this action through CGI. This
registry-based solution offers a perceptible performance gain;
however, it lacks CERN- or NCSA-standard .MAP files, consequently
forcing the administrator to create and maintain all map files.

Overall, WebSite is solid, but it lacks some of the more advanced
features of other products we reviewed. During our testing,
1.0d was the latest shipping release, however, 1.1 should be
available by the time you read this review. The new release
will include features on par with Purveyor 1.1a and CompuServe's
InternetOffice Web Server.

StarNine MacHTTP 2.2

MacHTTP is Chuck Shotton's shareware Web server for the Mac,
which was turned over to StarNine Technologies when Shotton
came onboard to develop WebStar. Touted by StarNine as the
most widely used desktop Web server on the Internet, this package
is distributed as a "fat binary" to run natively on both the
680x0 and PowerMac environments at a modest price.

The product is delivered via a single "Stuffit" file that can
be FTPed from StarNine's corporate Web server. No system extensions
or additional configuration is required to run, in contrast
to W3C and NCSA's HTTPd for the Unix platform, which require
significantly more tinkering.

Configuration of MacHTTP is accomplished via a simple text file
containing brief descriptions of server parameters along with
their set values. One problem with this server management approach
is that the administrator must take the server offline to modify
the configuration. This is handled well by configuration utilities
provided with several other solutions, including WebStar and
WebSite, which allow configuration changes on the fly.

Examining the contents of the configuration file may be somewhat
confusing to someone who has never managed a Web server before
and, unfortunately, the electronic documentation that comes
with the package doesn't offer much comfort in the way of details.
However, surfing through StarNine's Web pages reveals hefty,
readable discussions about each of the configuration options.
In this respect, StarNine's support is very similar to WebStar's,
which gives MacHTTP a higher level of utility and ease of use
than a thinly supported product, such as GLACI-HTTPD.

Third-party CGI support is available for MacHTTP and a list
of sources is located on StarNine's Web server. Although it
is not as extensive a list as that provided for WebStar, you
can still choose from several options. Of course, should you
not be able to find the routine you want, you can always resort
to AppleScript.

Netscape Communications

Commerce Server 1.12

By marketing a commercial server on the Unix platform in addition
to its popular browser, Netscape has set the technology market
ablaze. Priced quite a bit below Open Market's product, Netscape's
Commerce Server offers a few more features and a bit easier
installation. For the security conscious, the Commerce Server
is one of only two products in this review that support Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) secure Web service technology.

Installation starts with a simple script, which then hands off
to your choice of form-enabled Web browser. Using the extensive
online documentation (a printed version is available from Netscape),
we were able to have the server up and running in a few minutes.
With the addition of a few configuration variables, we had
our CGIs, such as image maps, doing business on the back end.
Don't be misled: Netscape's bundle does not offer any CGI utilities,
so you're on your own for securing and installing these utilities.

As with many Unix-based servers, the Commerce Server is fully
capable of being a drop-in replacement for an existing NCSA
server. Since we installed the NCSA's server prior to Netscape's,
the Commerce server was very easy to install. With simple use
of the configuration interface, we were able to tell the server
to look in our existing directories for server content and
CGI script. Of course, with most Unix-based solutions, you
must do quite a bit of setup before a Web server can be installed.

CompuServe InternetOffice Web Server 1.0

When the largest online service company purchased Spry, one
of the promises was that CompuServe would have a cross-platform
Web server by the end of 1995. CompuServe is delivering, and
it has servers that run on several platforms: Windows NT 3.51,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3, BSDI, and HP/UX 9.3 and 9.4. This
range of platforms allows for an easy corporatewide implementation
of Internet services.

In its first incarnation, InternetOffice Web Server looks and
feels solid. The installation, based on InstallShield Wizard,
is complete and sets up the majority of static options, rendering
it unnecessary to change them in the future. It also sub-installs
ODBC drivers, as InternetOffice includes support for ODBC to
act as the middleware for CGI and BGI scripts. Additionally,
InternetOffice Web Server includes support for remote administration
through Windows95 clients, the Perl programming language and
support for multiple IP addresses.

CompuServe's offering ships with five utilities: two administration
tools, an uninstaller, a performance monitor and an event viewer.
The standard administration tool has intuitive Start, Pause
and Stop buttons for manipulating the server, and all of the
options can be set by clicking on tabs within the main window.

Quarterdeck Corp. Web Server 1.0

Quarterdeck's entry Web Server for the Windows 3.1 environment
is a pleasantly compact and user-friendly system. Shipping
on just two diskettes, the product installs easily and operates
over Novell's LAN WorkPlace TCP/IP stack-a definite plus for
anyone already comfortably immersed in a NetWare environment.

One of Quarterdeck's strongest features is its server administration
utility, which is significantly more intuitive than either
WebStar's or NetManage's Personal Web Server utility. It uses
a clear and concise graphical interface to configure all components
of the Web server, from server name and IP address to domain,
group and user-specific access rights. Additional configuration
allows for path aliasing of files and directories, in which
one identifier represents an entire path everywhere it is used
as well as utilities for page redirection, in which a single
identifier refers to a data path on another Web server. The
power in this feature is that the server can expand its capacity
by adding machines, and seamlessly maintain one point of contact
to the Internet.

During testing, we were concerned with problems that resulted
from repeated access to documents on the server, as connections
were lost quite regularly. In attempting to resolve this problem,
we were repeatedly confounded by busy signals on Quarterdeck's
dial-up support line at all times during the day. Quarterdeck
is taking measures to examine its phone support usage in terms
of length of call and product in question to increase availability.

Open Market Systems Secure Web Server 1.1

Open Market, like Netscape, eases installation by using a standard
Web browser to install and configure the server. Open Market
is the only product reviewed here that supports both SSL and
Secure HTTP (S-HHTP) for encryption. Using a multithreaded
process, instead of forking, Secure WebServer uses a little
less memory than most Unix-based forked servers. Like Netscape,
if you stick to a supported platform, Open Market offers service
to the basic product.

Also like Netscape, installation starts with a simple script
that sets up the administrative server, then using a Web browser,
other aspects, such as server name, content directory and server
listening port, are configured. Through more advanced configurations,
directories for CGIs and path aliasing may be added using simple
HTML forms. Unlike the other Unix Web servers, image maps are
handled internally to the server and must be defined in the
CERN format, which is a bit different from the de facto NCSA
format.

Open Market offers security for transferring sensitive data
over the Internet. Improving on Netscape, Open Market offers
both SHTTP and SSL. Although using both is somewhat redundant,
it does offer flexibility in choosing a browser that supports
either protocol.

Unlike most other Unix server implementations, Secure Web Server
is not a plug-in replacement for NCSA's HTTPd. If you are already
running an NCSA server, you may want to consider Netscape for
a secure server replacement. Beware: Open Market's script claims
to assist in conversion, but we encountered less-than-successful
results when attempting to convert our files.

Ameritech Library Services NetPublisher 1.0

Ameritech's NetPublisher provides a number of features aimed
at a narrow variety of organizations and libraries. Providing
custom installations, it's positioned with features geared
toward electronic publishing of library documents as well as
communicating electronically with other libraries. Although
average in most categories, Ameritech's price is far above
any other product we tested.

Ameritech's view of the Web as a vehicle for networking libraries
accounts for this product's focus on allowing easy implementation
of a library system. Since this system is positioned as a "publishing"
solution, rather than a "presentation" system, the server is
complemented by NetPublisher Editor. Unlike anything else in
our review, the Editor views Web sites as containing structured
documents, similar in nature to how hard copy works. Additionally,
NetPublisher is a Z39.50 server that simplifies Internet-based
SQL searches. Although Z39.50 isn't a feature requested by
the majority of Web users, it is one that is the framework
for linking libraries.

NetManage Personal Web Server 4.6

Personal Web Server by NetManage is delivered as one of approximately
38 IP-based components in its product Chameleon for Windows
3.1. Personal Web Server is well named. It's not well suited
to publish any significant number of home pages, but it does
provide the basic services that users might want on platforms
they already have at their disposal.

Once we had the Personal Web Server out of the box, we were
amazed at its serious lack of documentation. There was a fair
amount of documentation supporting the other IP applications
in the package, but very little regarding Web services. Every
source we turned to for technical information proceeded to
point us at simplistic examples in a self-explanatory air.
For the novice Web administrator, it is clearly insufficient.

Although Personal Web Server does function adequately, we couldn't
shake the feeling that it was somewhat of an afterthought in
respect to the entire Chameleon product. Fortunately, it did
include several of the basic configuration features that we
have seen in other products that made it function on a par
with similar systems.

GLACI GLACI-HTTPD 2.01

NetWare is arguably one of the better platforms for file sharing,
and it only makes sense that a file sharing operation such
as Web services would be implemented there. Although we anticipated
a solid server with features and tools comparable to several
of the Windows NT and Unix-based products, GLACI-HTTPD from
the Great Lakes Area Commercial Internet (GLACI) is a Web server
that's still developing as a commercial product. Fortunately,
the development team at GLACI is running full steam ahead.

We came away from the tests of this product feeling that GLACI
is putting a solid effort into providing a Web server solution
for the NetWare platform. However, it still needs some work
to develop into a mature product. For the NetWare-phile who
enjoys system tinkering and writing NLMs, or someone just interested
in very simple home page publishing, this product will fit
the bill adequately. If you need a little more guidance, stay
tuned to GLACI's Web site as more features and utilities are
on the horizon.

Although we did not test it, GLACI does have a secure version
of its Web server which combines the basic GLACI-HTTPD with
the SSL flavor of secure Web service. A fully functional demonstration
copy of the product is easily available from GLACI's Web server
via FTP and is delivered in a single .ZIP file.

NCSA HTTPd 1.5, W3C HTTPd 3.0

Free and stable servers are available on the Internet if you
are not concerned about data encryption or easy installation.
W3C and NCSA offer Web servers precompiled for various platforms.
Source code is available for almost any other platform.

Installation and configuration are not for the Unix newbie,
although the addition of CGI and other trinkets are just as
easy as any of the commercial versions. "Un-tar-ing" the NCSA
distribution reveals a precompiled HTTPd executable as well
as other helpers, such as image map and other utilities. W3C
does not include anything beyond the HTTPd. Normally, installation
is actually quite simple. But, since our /usr/local/bin directory
is NFS mounted, we needed to install elsewhere.

Configuration of these freeware servers mirrors their commercial
counterparts, but graphical administration is not an offering.
Instead, a few configuration files will need to be edited.
For the average installation, these files are quite simple
to work with and include many examples and defaults that indicate
the proper formats.

Both products lack a secure mode, such as SSL or SHTTP. Therefore,
they are quite inappropriate for online sales or other sensitive
data. They do make an excellent choice for internal information
servers or other general data distribution servers.

Folio Corp. Infobase Web Server for Windows NT 1.0

Folio's Infobase Web Server is an easy-to-configure Windows
NT product that has an advantage over competing products: It
allows Internet access to "Infobases," which are Folio VIEWS
3.1 databases. However, this difference has made Folio's Infobase
a niche product lacking in a number of key areas.

The two-disk installation of Infobase Web Server was straightforward
and very similar to other Windows NT and Windows 3.1 products
tested. Resource requirements are hefty for Windows NT 3.5,
requiring a Pentium processor with 24 MB of RAM. Once the product
was installed, the configuration utilities were of little help
and paled in comparison to the bundled goodies and configuration
utilities from Process, Netscape and StarNine. Although Infobase
Web Server runs as a Windows NT Service, it conveniently places
an icon on the desktop for ease of stopping, or killing the
server.

Folio is aimed strictly at organizations with users who require
access to existing FolioVIEWS Infobases. If an NT-based, Web
to-database access is a requirement, although expensive, this
may be your product.

Web Servers: A Status Update



If there is one thing we noticed during our review, it is that
those companies that provided detailed explanations about configuration
and usage, either in hard or soft copy, undoubtedly ended up
with products that were easier to install and administer. Having
documentation to back you up is essential in taking on any
new project, such as installing and maintaining a Web server.
Those products that ignore this element, we feel, are destined
to no more than runner-up status.

In the battle of complexity versus ease of use, there is no
clear winner. It depends largely upon a potential administrator's
background and how they like to work. Many people might prefer
a system that is exceptionally easy to set up and maintain
in exchange for a smaller third-party support structure and
resides on a familiar computing platform. On the other hand,
we imagine that there are equally as many people who like the
challenge of diving into a new project that will require develop
ing a whole new set of technical skills on a system that is
highly customized. Either way, there are good solutions out
there.

Overall, we found most of the Web servers we evaluated to all
be in a developmental phase. In one or more areas we found
weaknesses that were either addressed by other products or
were perhaps available now as add-ons, but they should be part
of the product in the long run. One example is in server access
logging and reporting. Without exception, every product created
standardized log files sequentially detailing every transaction
performed by the server. Unfortunately, none of the products
included any utilities for scrutinizing that log file to extract
useful information. Three examples we can envision are: Reporting
on the number of hits to the server from each client domain;
reporting the number of hits on a given page hosted on the
server; and some kind of selected cross-reference of the previous
two. Clearly, these are statistics that any commercial service
could find immediately useful, let alone the curiosity of the
casual site administrator.

The good news is that most of the vendors we spoke with are
actively developing their product lines as this goes to print.
Several of the companies have new servers on the horizon, and
we have every reason to believe that Web servers will soon
come of age as truly mature and robust products.

How We Tested: Hardware And Operating Systems



Our testing of the listed products obviously required a diverse
set of hardware platforms to support the various operating
systems. Although we made no cross-platform performance tests,
we thought we'd share the configurations we used for our evaluations.

Macintosh OS System 7.5.1: We actually ran two different Macs
for the testing here. WebStar was delivered on an Apple Workgroup
Server 6150/66 with 24 MB of RAM. This machine was more than
adequate for the task and could probably be scaled back for
a small Web site. For those who want to take WebStar to its
limits, Apple will be introducing a PCI-bus version of the
Internet Server Solution this spring.

For testing MacHTTP, we chose what would be considered a "middle
of the road" solution by today's standards-a Quadra 950 with
24 MB of RAM. Although faster than many of the Macintoshes
still in use in the population, and compared with the Power
Macintoshes today, it seemed like a fair compromise. It also
gave us a chance to test the "Fat Binary" claim and confirm
that MacHTTP will run on both platforms.

NetWare 3.12/4.1: GLACI-HTTPD was tested on two separate platforms
to confirm compatibility with both NetWare 3.12 and 4.1. As
a departure from our other platforms, we selected a generic
486/33 MHz with 16 MB of RAM. We felt that there were probably
many sites with comparable equipment collected over the past
few years, and that this was representative of most of those
systems.

For our tests under NetWare 4.1, we used a Dell Dimension XPS
P90c with 32 MB of RAM. With its 90-MHz Pentium processor,
there were plenty of CPU cycles to go around, between running
NetWare 4.1 and

GLACI-HTTPD. Of course, we did not have additional modules running,
such as NetWare NFS, ATPS or something else. Had that been
the case, we probably would have needed to review the memory
requirements a little more closely.

Unix Environment: Our four Unix-based products were tested in
Solaris. Netscape's Commerce Server, NCSA HTTPd, W3C HTTPd,
and Open Market Systems Secure Web server, were tested under
Solaris 2.4 on a SPARCstation IPC. Although this machine is
not fast, it had 48 MB of RAM and should prove to be an adequate
platform for smaller sites with few CGIs. For busier or more
complex configurations, a Sun SPARC 20 class machine may be
in order.

Windows 3.1x: For our Windows 3.1-based products, we used a
Dell 450/ME with 16 MB of RAM. This machine was set up for
booting multiple discrete windows environments, and it was
easy to configure in several different circumstances. Although
many people are probably running both faster, more powerful
machines, we felt that this was a decent example of what is
likely a solid "middle-of-the-road" platform by today's standards.

Windows NT Server 3.51: For the Windows NT environment, we utilized
a Dell PowerEdge XE590-2, a dual-Pentium processor machine,
with 64 MB of RAM. This was a solid machine that gave us zippy
performance, not only while serving up Web pages but also when
switching configurations between products. We don't actually
consider this as a recommended first server, but it may provide
the kind of performance that a heavily used commercial site
might require.

Network Analyzers Race To Capture Fast Ethernet But Need To
Rev Their Engines

By:
Bruce Boardman

Fast Ethernet is pulling away in the 100-Mbps network race,
with infrastructure vendors turning out hubs, switches and
NICs with abandon. While there's nothing in a Fast Ethernet
packet to decode that is any different from a 10 Mbps Ethernet
packet, those Fast Ethernet packets sure do go by awfully fast.
We tested five analyzers for Fast Ethernet in our Syracuse
University lab. The software products included Novell's LANalyzer,
Intel's LANDesk Traffic Analyst, The AG Group's EtherPeek and
Cinco's NetXRay. At the top end, we pulled the wrappers off
Network General's hardware-based analyzer and ever-popular
Sniffer, now cruising at 100 Mbps.

A direct comparison among these products, however, wouldn't
exactly be fair. Their approaches, the market segments they
target and even the platforms they run on differ greatly. Our
goal was to get a sense of how today's offerings perform. While
we awarded Network General's Sniffer our Editor's Choice because
it clearly stood above this crowd, this market is still emerging.

Network General Fast Ethernet Sniffer

Nothing could compare to the Sniffer. HP is focusing on VG AnyLAN
(surprise, surprise). Azure and Comtest don't have products
yet. Wandel and Goltermann submitted a DA-30, but felt that
it was more of a development and benchmark tool. We agree.
And the software-based products just can't keep up.

However, in many respects, this new Sniffer is a little brother
to the 10-Mbps version. The interface, capture, decode and
performance are similar. And setting up offset filters and
decoding them is no different. But this new version has some
growing to do.

It's missing the ability to run the expert system while capturing
packets, for instance. When we tried to run the expert system,
the Sniffer displayed a message saying that it was dropping
back to classic, or normal mode. Network General says this
version of the expert system, ported from the 10-Mbps product,
can't run reliably online.

All is not lost, however. You can run a captured trace offline
through the expert system, and the Sniffer replays the trace
at a speed that won't overrun the processor. That's great,
in theory, but in practice this meant taking lots of little
capture snap shots, since the capture buffer without filters
fills rather quickly. Filtering cut down on the amount of traffic,
but then we weren't always sure we would know enough about
a reported problem to start off troubleshooting with a filter.
This whole process limits one of the Sniffer's most powerful
tools.

Also, historical statistical sampling is not part of this version,
but Network General plans to add it, along with online expert
processing to the v5.0 release due out around May of this year.
This release is scheduled to be a major upgrade in performance
and feature set. Upgrades to release 5.0 will be free.

The Sniffer's performance really stood out, only dropping a
couple of packets when we blasted 64,524 packets per second
(pps) on the wire-a high rate, despite only 45 percent utilization.
In a less stressful test, measuring statistics only, we stepped
utilization up to 100 percent just to see how accurately the
Sniffer measurements were, and at what point the user interface
locked up. In this scenario the Sniffer accurately measured
utilization to about 98 percent of the 100 Mbps maximum without
locking up.

Cinco NetXRay

Cinco's NetXRay is the '90's software analyzer. To be more precise,
it's the Windows95 analyzer. And it's the only one running
on Windows95 as of this writing. We've made much of how well
NetXRay compares to Novell's LANalyzer (see "NetXRay Exploits
Win95 for Protocol Analysis," October 15, 1995, page 50), but
while Novell hasn't changed much in the LANalyzer recently,
Cinco has had two releases of NetXRay since November 1995.
Cinco is trying harder and winning!

Cinco certainly improved its IPX stack decode, adding NCP since
our last review, but it left out burst mode capability, the
protocol more IPX networks are running.

Windows95-enhanced NetXRay's usability by lending consistency
to the interface. It borrows from Novell LANalyzer's dashboard
theme, displaying packets per second, utilization and errors
with speedometer-like gauges. It also extends this approach
to the capture display. These displays also offered the typical
Windows95 tab that showed us traditional tables of details.

Windows95's multitasking also enhanced NetXRay's responsiveness
under load. When we looked only at statistics and ran up network
utilization, the interface continued to respond up to about
35 percent-much higher than the other software analyzers. We
could tell there was a load on the wire, but we didn't have
to reduce the load to see the results, move the cursor or open
other processes.

In our capture performance test, NetXRay turned in the best
results of the Intel platform-based products. What is not shown
in the performance graph on page 114 is that even though NetXRay
did not capture all packets at 25 percent utilization (36,232
pps), at 20 percent utilization (29,068 pps) NetXRay captured
95 percent of the controlled packets.

AG Group EtherPeek

EtherPeek is the best product that you shouldn't buyyet. Yes,
it's a superior low-end analyzer. It's fast, well designed,
decodes the heck out of Fast Ethernet and has the lowest price
in town. But hold onto your green if you're looking for a 100
Mbps Fast Ethernet analyzer, because EtherPeek isn't as good
as it will be.

EtherPeek's modular design is one of its best features. You
can add functions to the analyzer engine by adding parameter
files. For instance, the version we tested let us decode 100
Mbps Ethernet by adding a hardware interface file for a Farallon
Fast EtherTX-10/100 card. But the modularity can also get in
the way of EtherPeek being a full-featured analyzer. For instance,
EtherPeek has added the ability to capture traffic from a 100
Mbps Fast Ethernet segment, but hasn't updated the analyzer's
ability to calculate statistics. The statistical elements reported
and the format of the display was good up to 10 Mbps, but utilization
rates beyond that produced garbage. AG Group is aware of the
discrepancy and will correct it in its next major release,
due out some time in the first quarter of this year.

The decodes and filters are deep, flexible and customizable.
EtherPeek comes with more than 450 pre-set offset filters that
you can modify. The decodes use the usual color and indentation
to distinguish stack and protocol information, and they were
surprisingly compact and easy to read.

You can add decodes, like the filters and hardware interface
files by simply adding the appropriate file. The AG Group has
a unique policy of making upgrades and new decodes available
for no charge on its Web site. Users can also create their
own decodes, using examples in EtherPeek's Decoder Mechanisms
Document, which explains how to set up unique decodes.

EtherPeek's intelligent threading, which is an expert-like ability
to trace upper-layer session traffic of AppleTalk, TFTP, SMTP,
NFS, SNMP and NCP sessions, is a unique feature among the software
analyzers. The AG Group will add duplicate IP address monitoring
to the next release.

The failure to calculate statistical percentages didn't keep
EtherPeek from performing well. We ran it on a 6150 Power Macintosh
with the Farallon TX 10/100 Ethernet NuBus card. We were surprised
how responsive the interface remained into the upper 20 percent
utilization rates. Given that the 6150 and the NuBus don't
have quite the horsepower or throughput the 90-MHz Pentium
and Intel 100-Mbps PCI card have, EtherPeek will likely provide
better performance on a faster platform.

EtherPeek's capture performed well compared to others. It captured
100 percent of the control packets transferred up to 9,434
pps, representing six percent utilization. Eighty-eight percent
of the packets were captured at 10,416 pps, representing seven
percent utilization. Occasionally it captured all the packets
at this utilization rate. This put EtherPeek solidly behind
NetXRay but well ahead of LANalyzer.

Novell LANalyzer for Windows

This veteran software analyzer is a proven troubleshooting tool
designed to make network analysis easy. LANalyzer is the Chevy
of analyzers. It is the most intuitive analyzer on the market.
Its dashboard-like gauges and simple flat menus are easy to
figure out. Novell helps the neophyte get started with context
sensitive troubleshooting help, a tutorial and a book on baselining
and troubleshooting (see our review "Software Analyzers Bring
Right Features, Right Price," July 1, 1995, page 116)

As a true software analyzer relying completely on the ODI stack,
did LAN-alyzer have the guts to perform at 100-Mbps speeds?
In last year's 10-Mbps tests, we were surprised how well it
did, but the 100-Mbps world was another story. When we ran
utilization above the maximum in the 10-Mbps world, LANalyzer
set off alarms. We found there was no way to increase the alarm
thresholds beyond the 10-Mbps limits, and no way to turn alarming
off. This was a little frustrating since utilization measurements
of 100-Mbps traffic were correct.

Capture performance was poor considering that LANalyzer had
an unfair advantage with its limited filtering capability;
since the LANalyzer cannot set pre-capture offset filters,
it couldn't capture IP sessions as part of the performance
load, which is one important way we tested the other analyzers.
But still, it only captured 100 percent of the packets at up
to 4 percent utilization (6,408 pps), which was only better
than Intel's Traffic Analyst.

The performance results displaying utilization were mixed. On
the positive side, LANalyzer correctly reported utilization
to about 70 percent. But the user interface began to become
sluggish at about 5 percent utilization and completely unusable
at 10 percent. We had to remove the network load before mouse
and screen updates returned. In our test environment, it really
wasn't a big deal, since we can just turn the load off. But
in a real environment it means having to yank the wire.

Intel LANDesk Traffic Analyst

The Traffic Analyst has all of the components to be a good tool.
The user interface is easy to understand and use. Statistics
and capture features are solid. Filtering is sophisticated
and flexible; in fact, the entire product is. But we can only
recommend it for very lightly used Fast Ethernet segments:
Its performance at high speeds is practically unusable.

The initial user interface displays statistical station utilization
tables and graphics that gave us a quick idea of how the network
was doing. There are three unique thermometer-like gauges that
slide up and down with variations of packet rate, utilization
and errors. They also feature little pointers that indicate
traffic high water marks. The approach was good, but like EtherPeek,
it did not scale to 100 Mbps.

Traffic Analyst's statistical design is for traffic loads up
to 10 Mbps. For example, Traffic Analyst topped out at 8,000
pps-a significant rate in the 10-Mbps world, but completely
undersized for the 100-Mbps rates that can easily reach 20,000
or 30,000 pps, and max out at over 114,000 pps.

Utilization rates were much better, accurately displaying into
the 60 percent range before producing incorrect results. The
user interface began to slow down during statistical measurement
at 21 percent utilization.

The user interface didn't do so well under the load of our offset
capture filter, becoming sluggish as utilization approached
10 percent. We scaled back traffic to a load range of 6,408
pps-that of a heavily utilized 10-Mbps Ethernet network-but
the Traffic Analyst could not keep up. We had to run utilization
down to 3 percent utilization (5,522 pps) to capture 100 percent
of the packets. If you capture a packet with the Traffic Analyst,
be thankful!

How We Tested Fast Ethernet Analyzers



We tested Fast Ethernet analyzers using a stressful offset capture
filter and increasing network traffic to find out just how
well each was able to deal with the loads imposed by 100-Mbps
traffic. We used Netcom Systems' X-1000 Fast Ethernet Tester
a development/test device that can deliver consistent utilization
loads well over the 148,810-pps Fast Ethernet maximum, with
inter-packet delays as small as 40 nanoseconds. It is also
capable of extremely detailed test scenarios for all kinds
of Fast Ethernet devices. As a control, we used a Wandel and
Goltermann DA-30 equipped to test and analyze 100-Mbps Fast
Ethernet. It verified utilization rates and generated background
traffic.

The platforms the analyzers ran on varied. All of the Windows
based analyzers ran on 90-MHz Pentium processors with 32 MB
of memory and Intel Fast Ethernet PCI cards. EtherPeek, our
only Mac-based analyzer, could not run with PCI due to some
unresolved performance issues with Apple's Open Transport PCI
API, which is holding up The AG Group's release of a PCI interface
file (Apple is addressing these performance issues and by press
time will likely have them resolved). Network General delivers
the Sniffer on a 100-MHz Pentium processor with 32 MB of memory
and a specially designed Cogent PCI Fast Ethernet card, to
which Network General specifically tailors its code.

For the most part, all the analyzers were able to correctly
measure utilization to about the 85 percent range, but their
user interfaces either froze or became unusable at much lower
utilization rates. The exception was the Sniffer, which remained
consistently responsive in the 90 percent range and accurately
displayed utilization above 95 percent.

An analyzer's primary job, however, is to capture packets. So
we set each analyzer with a pre-capture offset filter to capture
packets between two IP addresses. To force each analyzer to
examine each packet, we loaded the wire with 64-byte broadcast
packets. We transmitted the broadcast packets at a steady rate
and then transferred a controlled number of packets that met
the offset pre-capture filter.

20 V.34 PC (Politically Correct) Card Modems Can't Change The
Weather

By:
Bruce Boardman

Looks and features don't account for much with these little
rectangle flat pieces of metal, but the performance packed
inside sure does. Living just a bit longer than we care to
admit with 20 PCMCIA modems, or to be more politically correct,
PC Card modems, we found a large spread in the way that they
performed.

Modems can't do much about the weather (I'm sure a napkin somewhere
holds the beginnings of a "Barometer Jack"), but they had better
be able to deal with it. Phone lines, like the weather, change
from one connection to the next, and the better modems are
able to deal with these changes. In setting up the environment
to test V.34 PC Card modems, we wanted to make the test as
real world as possible. Since we couldn't recreate sun spots
or hurricanes, we settled on most of the possible combinations
of phone connections in the good ole "U.S. of A."

It is important to test modems over varying conditions, so testing
over a single connection type, (that is, over a PBX), while
consistent, does not fully expose the smarts or lack thereof
within each modem. Of equally little value is testing that
begins with a clean phone, to which gradual increments of noise
are added. While some modems may be able to withstand higher
error rates, error correction alone does not a modem make.

Modem manufactures have to balance speed, equalization, error
correction and compression variables, to mention a few, to
blend the perfect modem (make that an "Olive Jack," shaken
not stirred). The best test of this blending is of course how
well it works from the places that you call from, over the
phone lines that you use. And so, that is what we have done.

We ran a battery of tests that accurately measured how often
and how fast each modem performed over varying phone line conditions,
which represented more than 90 percent of the possible connections
that could be made in the continental U.S. The fastest modems,
with the most robust features typically cost more, but high
price didn't always mean a modem would do well. In fact, not
all of the expensive modems were fast or full featured.

Our winner, Practical Peripherals' ProClass 288 V.34, turned
in a close second in performance and edged out the speed kings,
Motorola's Marquis and 3Com's Etherlink III 3C562TP, with a
price that was hard to beat. Another worthy opponent, TravelCard's
288P from Microcom, turned in almost the same performance as
the ProClass 288 V.34, but it lost out because of a higher
price point.

At the bottom of the heap, the Toshiba NoteWorthy NW288CR, failed
to complete successful connections during one test-unfortunately,
this particular test totaled nearly a quarter of the possible
connections (24 percent) in the continental U.S. While not
at all failure prone, the Xircom PS-CEM28 consistently transferred
at the slowest rates in both test suites.

Bells and Whistles

Overall, the modems we tested share most of the same features,
with a few good ones that merit special mention. Cellular capabilities,
offered by the Apex Data V.34 Cellular Data Fax modem, EXP
Computer ThinFAX 288C, Toshiba NoteWorthy NW288CR and Simple
Technology 28.8 Communicator, all boast compatibility with
leading cellular phone manufacturers, the likes of which include
NEC, Mitsubishi, GE and AT&T.

Although not specifically covered in this review, four vendors
shipped us products that were actually combination V.34 modem
and 10-Mbps Ethernet cards. These included ActionTec's ComNet
28.8, Motorola's Marquis, 3Com's EtherLink III 3C562TP and
Xircom's PS-CEM28. Combo cards are a good way to save a slot
and often cost less than purchasing these products separately.

Finally, a couple of unique jacks were displayed by our participants.
MultiTech Systems' MT2834LT has a detachable, very compact,
hard plastic "Cool Jack" dongle. Besides being small, its second
RJ-11 jack provides the ability to plug in a telephone-a nice
feature when you're staying somewhere with only one phone line.
The spring loaded retractable XJack on the Megahertz XJ2288
is really cool and means you don't need a dongle. The XJ288
also protects the modem from burning out with its digital line
guard, should the modem accidentally be plugged into a digital
phone jack.

Less Is More

Most PC Cards, because they run on laptops with limited batteries,
claim to improve battery life by decreasing their power draw.
The NewMedia V.34 Net Surfer, EXP Computer's ThinFAX 288C and
Angia's SafeJack 288 displayed this trait and had the lowest
operating draw measured at 160 mA. When not in use, these cards
can also hibernate in an idle mode. Again, Angia's SafeJack
288 gobbles up a mere 2 mA in idle mode. One last power mode,
sleep mode, takes effect when your laptop is suspended. While
a number of products could survive with power draws of 2 or
3 mA, Xircom and NewMedia required no power at all.

The power-hungry cards were lead by Zoom's V.34C, sucking up
790 mA in operation mode-even more of a power drain than any
of the combo cards. The Xircom PS-CEM28 more than made up for
its zero power draw in sleep mode by gobbling up a significant
410 mA in idle mode-also more than any combo card or otherwise.

Performance Results

Motorola's Marquis and 3Com's EtherLink III LAN/Modem Card were
the best performers, hands down. Not only were they fast, but
they made 49 percent of all possible connections for the random
file test, transferring at or more than 9,000 characters per
second (cps). This was coupled with a low 1 percent ratio of
failure for both performance tests. This pair proved that they
could push the envelope to the edge.

On the other side, the Xircom PS-CEM288 was consistently very
slow. For both the TSB-38 and the random file performance testing,
all of the possible connections, which equal 90.5 percent of
the possible connections in the continental U.S., transferred
below 6,000 cps. Some of the transfers were even as slow as
2,000 cps. Although a pokey performer, the PS-CEM288 is reliable,
not dropping a single connection throughout our testing.

There were a few leaders in the dubious category of failed connections.
Apex Data's Mobile V.34 Plus Cellular Data/FAX had 14 percent
of the possible connections failing when transferring the TSB
38 file. MultiTech System's MT2834LT failed on 12 percent of
the possible connections when transferring the random file.
While these numbers are bad, the worst of all was Toshiba NoteWorthy's
NW288CR, which failed 19 percent of the possible connections
when transferring the TSB-38 file and 24 percent of the possible
connections when transferring the random file.

It is interesting to note that some of the modems support a
DTE rate higher than 115.2 Kbps. While it might seem that higher
rates, like the 300 Kbps boasted by both Microcom modems would
provide an advantage, it wasn't included in our testing. Primarily,
this is because the V.42bis compression implemented by all
of these V.34 modems will only compress to a maximum of 4:1.
This means that a very compressible file will only see a four
times 28.8 Kbps, or 115.2 Kbps transfer rate. Although it is
possible to compress files with a better than 4:1 ratio using
proprietary compression algorithms, to squeeze a compressible
file better than V.42bis sacrifices interoperability-it is
usually only a option in environments where modem interoperability
is not required.

TIA

And I don't mean Maria. The Telecommunications Industry Association
(TIA) issues Telecommunications Systems Bulletins (TSBs) that
give engineers something to do on their day off. Two of these
TSBs, numbers 37 and 38, are of particular relevance to the
issue of testing modems in the real-world way that we described
above.

TSB-37A is a painstaking account of each synapse in the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It describes all of the
possible switched connections in the continental U.S. Boiled
down, this consists of seven different local loops (phone company
lingo for the phone line that goes from your place to their
local equipment), and 24 different network connections (phone
company connections between phone company offices). This builds
a matrix of 168 different possible connections.

So, if you think that each modem needed to be tested 168 times,
you'd be wrong! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Actually the likelihood
of getting one of the 168 connections is not random when looking
at the U.S. as a whole. The TSB-37A describes how often each
of the 168 possible connection is likely to occur.

TSB-38, the next document in the TIA series, explains how (in
great detail) these test should be performed. We turned to
the leaders in this field in order to accomplish this precision
 Telecom Analysis Systems (TAS) of Eatontown, N.J.

With the TAS system we were able to selectively test and accurately
record very specific tests. We configured the equipment to
test all connections that had a likelihood of occurrence greater
than .38 percent (yes that's less then one half of one percent).
In this way, we were able to test 36 different connections
representing just under 91 percent of all possible connections
in the continental U.S.

What is important is that each of the possible connections tested
indicates not only how a modem is going to perform, but how
often it does.

The Tests

We transferred files in a single direction over each connection
while the modems were installed in a pair of Compaq Contura
410CXs. We used two different files, one defined in the TSB
38 and one randomly selected, both with text-like and similar
compression characteristics as measured with PKZIP. We set
the modems with error correction, compression and autobauding
to measure the performance of all of the balancing elements.

Originally we had added the second file in response to a vendor's
concern that modems with larger V.42bis dictionaries were given
an unfair advantage when testing using the TSB-38 files. The
vendor's contention was that a quirk of the TSB-38 file gave
unfairly boosted compression to those with larger dictionaries,
and thereby boosted overall modem performance. He claimed that
some modem vendors were adding to the dictionaries in order
to win magazine reviews. Imagine that! Our tests not only did
not substantiate this, but in every case, modems with big dictionaries
performed better on the random file, indicating that there
was no quirk in the TSB-38 file. Furthermore, our tests revealed
that as expected, modems with larger dictionaries were generally
faster than those with smaller dictionaries.

It is important to note that as a general rule, modems with
larger V.42bis dictionaries will tend to be faster on a compressible
file and slower on uncompressible files when compared to modems
with smaller dictionaries. Also of note: TSB-38 dictates that
if a transfer fails to connect, or is unable to transfer data
because of errors, it is considered to have failed. Tough crowd.

Understanding the Graphs

Each of the file transfer performance graphs represent how fast
or how often a modem is likely to connect. Each graph represents
the entire range of characters per second transferred by all
the modems tested. That overall range has been grouped into
four charts.

For example, the TSB-38 file transfer performance graph has
the group 8,000 cps and above. All of the modems that transferred
data at the rate of 8,000 cps or faster are listed in that
graph. The bars next to the listed modems indicate the percentage
of connections in which they averaged 8,000 cps or more.

Price

The combo cards tested were at a disadvantage due to their higher
cost. We did, however, award points in the features comparison
for their LAN ability. Interestingly enough, the Microcom TravelCard
Fast tied with the Motorola Marquis at $599 for the highest
price, but it only offered modem functionality. Stop back for
a visit in a few issues where we'll compare combo V.34/Ethernet
cards for modem and LAN functionality in a head-to-head review.

Whatever Happened To IBM and US Robotics?



There were two modems didn't make it into our final 20:  The US
Robotics Courier Dual Standard V.34 PCMCIA and IBM's WaveRunner.
Both were supplied in plenty of time but would not function with
our TAS test equipment.  In USR's case we tried everything even
swapping cards with USR so that they successfully tested on near
identical test equipment-all to no avail.  Sorry USR fans.  We
hope to test it in the future.  The WaveRunner was a slightly
different story.  Rather than a firmware-based chip set like
AT&T's or Rockwell's, IBM's other card uses a completely software
driven DSP design that required Windows or OS/2.  Our test
software was DOS-based, and while IBM said that a DOS window
should have worked, it was not too happy when it did not.  By
press time a Windows version of the test software will be
available, which should allow us to test the WaveRunner next time
around.

Online Services And The Internet: The Network Manager's Friend
Or Foe?

By:
Andy Covell

Your users and your management have heard the hype or have been
bitten by the cyber bug, and they now know that they can't
live without Internet access whether they're in the office
or on the road-and they need it now!

So, how do you get your users on the Net without having to devote
half your staff to set-up, troubleshooting and hand-holding?
Online services may be just the answer, since they now offer
reliable, well supported dial-up Internet access.

We evaluated the Windows and Macintosh Internet access offerings
of the "big three" online services-America Online, CompuServe
and Prodigy, as well as the Microsoft Network (for Windows95).
If your organization already supports a corporate LAN or WAN
with Internet connectivity, you may want to use an online service
for mobile or remote personnel. If you lack Internet connectivity
altogether, you might consider an online service for in-house
staff. In either case, you can depend on online services for
easy Internet access that impose a minimal burden on your technical
support staff.

A focus for many corporate users is nuts and bolts network access
to corporate information and computing resources, as well as
easy interaction with corporate network users, so we focused
attention not only on flashy Web browsers, but also on some
of the more mundane but very important features of Internet
access, such as telnet access, e-mail attachments and un-anonymous
FTP. We also gathered information to gauge geographic dial
up coverage and availability of faster V.34 and ISDN lines.

None of the services we reviewed comes close to our idea of
an ideal service with regard to corporate Internet access:
One which is easy to use; offers a full suite of bullet-proof
access tools for both Windows and Macintosh clients; offers
ubiquitous high-speed access; enables seamless third-party
software options; and allows the corporation to easily pick
up what are very reasonable usage fees. Yet, each has its own
highlights, and given a specific situation, one or the other
may be just the ticket.

CompuServe, our Editor's Choice, offers the best overall mix
of features, coverage, flexibility and pricing, and did respectably
grade. The other services contain flaws that relegate them
to a lower rung in our ranking. America Online, the only service
to offer a Web browser for both Windows and Macintosh users,
is a friendly service with a few problems-the largest of which
is its inflexible payment options. The Microsoft Network rates
high on some features, but its newness translates into some
shortcomings when it comes to things like accessibility and
billing options, and its inability to run on anything but Windows95
machines keeps it from competing at the same level as CompuServe
when it comes to widespread deployment. Prodigy has some significant
technical limitations, but the tools Prodigy offers are good
quality, and the service offers good pricing/payment options.

CompuServe

Among the strengths of the CompuServe Information Manager interface
for Windows (WinCIM) and Macintosh (MacCIM) are their easy
to-use FTP, telnet and newsreader tools. The FTP is simple
and quite functional, as is the telnet application, which includes
built-in print and file capture. The newsreader worked well,
offers an auto-decode capability and includes a nifty feature
that lets users search the postings of any selected newsgroup
by keyword. Like the AOL and Prodigy newsreaders, the CompuServe
newsreader offers a utility that lets you search for newsgroups
using keywords.

The WinCIM and MacCIM e-mail program is workable but somewhat
lacking, since Internet addressing is not standard (requiring
that you insert Internet: prior to the address in the To: field)
and attachments to and from the Internet are not supported.

The new WinCIM 2.01 interface provides seamless access to proprietary
CompuServe services and the Internet. Just click the Web icon
on the WinCIM toolbar to launch the Web browser, which is Spry
Mosaic. Then, from the Web browser, click on the WinCIM button
to toggle back to the proprietary interface. Unfortunately,
as it stands now, your users will be confused if they try to
navigate to the Web browser from the WinCIM "Explore Services"
menu by clicking on "Internet" and then "World Wide Web." They'll
end up reviewing instructions for loading the old Netlauncher
software (the WinCIM 2.01 software was not downloadable during
our review). Hopefully, this will be fixed by press time.

The new WinCIM installation also solves the CompuServe/Windows95
PPP conflict found in the previous PPP/Winsock setup by copying
the CompuServe Winsock into CompuServe directories, leaving
the Microsoft Winsock in the WINDOWS directory.

The lack of a Web browser for the Macintosh is clearly a drawback,
but CompuServe gives Macintosh users instructions and a new
configuration utility that makes it fairly easy for users to
set up MacPPP and MacTCP and run with a third-party browser.
For Windows users, the CompuServe PPP and Winsock support also
provides great flexibility so you can consider a wide range
of Windows-based, third-party software solutions.

CompuServe has a well-supported invoice billing arrangement
a clear plus for decision-makers considering an online service.
The corporate billing option, coupled with the provision of
some reasonable pricing alternatives, puts CompuServe at the
top of the heap when it comes to this aspect of the online
connection.

America Online

The America Online service is smooth and slick, and easy to
use. In fact, it's the easiest to use of the packages we tried.
It's no surprise that AOL is the first choice for millions
of consumers. While an easy-to-use, pretty package certainly
may have its place, the clear consumer orientation won't make
it for many corporate applications.

The basic Internet tools that AOL provides are well done. The
FTP client is functional and includes text, GIF and JPEG viewers.
The newsreader includes a function for searching for newsgroups,
and it offers a File Grabber, which automatically downloads
and decodes threaded binary-encoded postings. The lack of a
telnet interface is one drawback, but for corporations that
don't have any terminal applications, it's not a problem.

The AOL Web browser, while a little clunkier looking than the
more conventional browsers of its competitors, still gives
you the basics. And it's fully integrated with the AOL interface
on both the Windows and Macintosh platforms. Additionally,
AOL offers Winsock for Windows users, making it possible to
implement other third-party TCP/IP clients.

While most of this is good news for potential corporate customers,
AOL pricing and payment options are not. AOL offers only one
fee schedule and does not offer any sort of corporate account
with invoice billing. The solution we were offered from the
sales personnel, when we asked how to go about setting up accounts
for corporate users, was to put each account on an American
Express card. It is unlikely that this will be a workable solution
for organizations thinking of using an online service in any
serious way.

Microsoft Network

Comparing Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online with the Microsoft
Network is really comparing various apples to an orange. Sure
they all provide dial-up access to content, services and the
Internet at comparable price points. But the MSN Explorer only
runs on Windows95 machines, and the MSN interface, developed
from the ground up as part of Windows95, is more tightly integrated
with the operating system. Also, MSN full Internet access does
not run on much of the installed base of Intel desktops (a
386 or 486 must have 6 MB minimum, with 8 MB as a more realistic
minimum); a Macintosh version of the interface is still being
developed.

The Microsoft Network interface can be loaded from the Windows95
installation disk(s), but the Internet access portions of the
basic package are limited. Once you log into MSN, you can view
newsgroups or use Internet e-mail (using MS Exchange configured
for MSN). For full Internet access, you must either download
software from the MSN, or purchase the Plus! package and load
from the installation CD. You also need to change the phone
number you dial in your MSN Settings, and load some programs
and files (for example, telnet.exe and ftp.exe) from the Windows95
installation media. Of course all of this is automated, making
the task a little time consuming, but not difficult.

Access to the Microsoft Network can be carried out explicitly,
by double-clicking on the MSN icon. Starting up any program
that requires Internet access will also automatically initiate
MSN login. You can even create Internet shortcuts on your desktop
that will automatically connect to the Microsoft Network and
navigate to the resource specified. This is an experience that
drives home the tight integration of the Windows95 operating
system with full-featured Internet access via the Microsoft
Network. The PPP support of MSN's full Internet access dial
ups, coupled with the Windows95 Winsock, give you plenty of
third-party software options.

The use of the Microsoft Exchange package for MSN e-mail provides
a solid e-mail package. Binary attachments to and from the
Internet are supported, and the e-mail program can be configured
to send and receive mail and other electronic correspondence
from a variety of sources in addition to the Internet.

The FTP and telnet programs, which are part of Windows95 and
reside in the Windows directory, are not announced as part
of the "Internet Center" within the Microsoft Network. To run
them you use the Run... command and just enter telnet or ftp,
or create a shortcut, so you have an icon to click. The FTP
program is a command-driven interface with no advanced features.
The telnet is good, allowing for significant tailoring when
it comes to fonts, colors and the like, and it enables terminal
logging as well as cut and paste.

The new version of Microsoft's Web browser (Internet Explorer
2.0) is feature-rich when compared to the browsers found on
the other services. For example, it includes support for several
new HTML extensions, Secure Sockets Layer and built-in e-mail.
A VRML plug-in should be available as you read this.

Prodigy

The Prodigy service offers an easy-to-use, proprietary package
with some good pricing options. While not up to the standards
set by CompuServe on many fronts, the service does have some
features that make it rather unique, and it will likely improve
greatly over the short term. Much of the Prodigy interface
is being ported to the HTML environment, and a Mac version
of the Web browser is due out within 45 days of this writing.
Look for good things to come with regard to Prodigy and the
Internet.

Prodigy lacks standalone FTP and telnet tools entirely. Telnet
is just not possible, while FTP must be done via the Web browser.
Although FTP via the Web works pretty well for anonymous FTP,
it gets quite cumbersome with un-anonymous FTP, and it introduces
a security hole in the process, since users must enter username
and password as part of a pseudo-URL to gain access to a remote
host for FTP. If a user isn't careful, that information is
retained in the URL history, and anyone with subsequent access
to browser can easily retrieve this sensitive information from
the global history list.

Prodigy's e-mail program is adequate, but not great. It offers
standard Internet addressing, provided an address does not
exceed 40 characters (in which case a nickname must be created
for the long Internet address). Attachments to and from Internet
users are not yet supported.

The Prodigy newsreader works well, and it was the newsreader
we ended up turning to most frequently. It has a very good
FAQ SEARCH feature, which enables you to easily retrieve and
display the FAQ from any newsgroup you read.

The Prodigy Web browser has all the basic functions. Its noteworthy
features include the ability to send Internet e-mail from within
the browser. Another good feature of the Prodigy Web interface
is a Prodigy home page search link, which takes you to another
Prodigy Web page that links to a large number of Internet search
tools including: Yahoo, WAIS, Archie, Infoseek, Image Finder,
People Search and the W3 search engines. This useful page exemplifies
the move to HTML for all Prodigy information and help files.

Online Services Pricing And Payment Options


For a network manager considering an online service for end
user Internet access, price and payment options are an important
consideration. Paying exorbitant fees for employees who rack
up the usage, or hassling with individual credit card payments
or reimbursements is clearly something to avoid. CompuServe,
with two pricing schemes and an established invoice billing
option, sets the standard. Prodigy, with a brand new invoice
billing option, is now a challenger in this category, while
AOL and MSN clearly have some catching up to do.

Other Internet Access Options Are In The Wings



Each of the online services we reviewed has its limitations,
and none may be up to the task for you. But never fear-there
are numerous alternatives. One is to sign on with a national
Internet service provider like Performance Systems International
(PSI) or Netcom. These outfits offer aggressive pricing and
they are out in front when it comes to support for technologies
like V.34 and ISDN. Telecommunications companies are also an
option, with MCI and its internetMCI Dial Access service leading
the way. Even the Regional Bell Operating Companies will be
getting into the act with Pacific Bell and Ameritech both announcing
that they will offer Internet dial-up access in 1996. Local
and regional Internet access providers are another possibility
if your needs are contained within a smaller geographic area.
These providers sometimes offer very attractive prices and
services. For those who like the support of an online service
but don't like the way Internet access works in the online
service framework, both AOL and CompuServe are offering Internet
only packages that may cater to your needs quite nicely: The
GNN (AOL) and Spryte (CompuServe) services should be in full
swing by press time. We'll do our part to try to help you understand
your dial-up Internet access options with thorough reviews
of some of the services we've mentioned above.

On The Edge: ATM: Ready Or Not? Here It Comes!

By:
Art Wittmann

I love new stuff. I would rather spend a month trying to get
a new technology to work (even if it means putting the user
community through a little turmoil on the road to newer and
better services) than buy an old proven technology and get
it to work in a day. I like the challenge, and I almost universally
like the result.

I started writing for Network Computing three months after its
premier issue hit my mailbox. The first couple of years, I
freelanced and kept my full-time job at the University of Wisconsin's
Computer Aided Engineering Center (CAE), where I've worked
for more than a decade. The past few years, I've been with
Network Computing full time, while still maintaining a part
time appointment at CAE. In that time, I've pushed, both upon
you and upon the staff at CAE, my lust for new technology (and
toys for that matter)

I bought CD players when a basic one cost more than $800, and
made CAE move to NetWare 3.0 long before we ever should have.
On the other hand, jumping on the latest technology bandwagon
for the better part of a decade has given me some perspective
as well as a number of battle scars. And that is the perspective
of this column, On the Edge: Looking at new technologies and
trends and trying to decide whether to jump in with both feet
or sit on the side lines and watch for a while longer. Occasionally
we'll talk about industry players and their implementation
of technology, and sometimes we'll just talk about the technology
itself. What could make a better first topic than ATM?

On to ATM

Not so long ago, some colleagues at the University of Wisconsin
and I were trying to decide if converting our network to ATM
in the next six months was the right move. We talked at some
length about the pros and cons of making the leap, but the
guy who holds the purse strings kept coming back the central
question: "Is it ready?"

We began the discussion as though this "problem" with ATM was
something new. "Gee, the standards are evolving so slowly,
what if we have to buy something and then throw it away in
a year or so?"

Yeah, right-like we've never faced that problem before! Maybe
you don't remember the battles over UTP Ethernet and all the
nonstandard ports of that technology that shipped. If you haven't
been in the local area networking game that long, then maybe
you'll be a little more familiar with questions about FDDI.
If you waited until FDDI's Station Management standard was
set in stone you wouldn't have bought any FDDI equipment until,
ummm I guess they still aren't done with that standard, are
they?

At some point, the standards bodies give themselves a life by
enhancing technology that is more than mature enough to deploy.
In the case of FDDI, more than a decade has been spent enhancing
the FDDI standard. Purgatory must be filled with people who
have the character to serve on such committees for their entire
run-and when you're sent there, you're forced to make conversation
with them. Ah, they could regale you with such stories-the
arguments over the proper use of the DR bit in the SDR byte
could amuse you for years. (For those of you who have just
reached for your FDDI standards manuals to look up the SRD
byte-stop. I made it up-and you should be ashamed of yourselves.)

Is ATM like this? Of course it is. The ATM Forum will create
some less-than-useful features within ATM and we'd be foolish
to believe otherwise. However, important and revolutionary
work is still to be done by these committees, so the question
of ATM's suitability for production networks is quite valid.

Look Who's Talking Now

Two companies in particular claim that ATM is ready for prime
time. Cisco Systems and Bay Networks have both recently released
products with the claim that these are the right ones upon
which to base your ATM infrastructure. In Cisco's case, we're
talking about the LightStream 1010, which was announced late
last November and will be delivered early this year. In Bay's
case, the product is the System 5000AH and its associated modules.

Both products came with the promise of being the stuff from
which production networks are made. I talked to both companies
at some length about the products and each company went out
of its way to tell me how these boxes were field upgradeable
both in terms of firmware and microcode. No small wonder, two
of the most critical ATM standards are just getting to the
point of being deployable. These standards are Private Network
to Network Interface (PNNI) and Available Bit Rate (ABR). Supporting
PNNI basically allows you to build extremely large ATM-based
networks (like Internet-sized networks)

Cisco calls PNNI the most complex and ambitious routing protocol
ever devised. Cisco also claims that the LS1010 is the first
box in the world to support it. It's always good to be the
first one to support a standard, because then your customers
can't ask you about compatibility with other customers. PNNI
is indeed a beefy spec, requiring Cisco to use processors 15
to 20 times more powerful than those found in the 7000 series
to support it.

ABR is supported on Cisco's box and will be supported through
a microcode upgrade on Bay's box. ABR is basically a mechanism
to allow bursty LAN-style traffic to run well on busy (congested)
ATM networks. It's a tricky technology and depends upon rapidly
responding to requests to slow down traffic flows. If an ATM
device can't respond quickly, it'll probably miss the time
window where a response would have done any good.

This means it needs to be done in hardware near where ATM cells
are sent and received. This also means that if ABR isn't supported
on the switch you already own, you've got a new boat anchor
when you decide to build a network that supports ABR. That
generally includes any switch produced prior to this year.
Now you can see why Bay and Cisco are pushing hard on the fact
that the newer technology is very upgradeable-right down to
the microcode level.

Let's Say You Buy Now

If you decide you want ATM now, and there are plenty of reasons
why you might want it, just how much of your early 1996 investment
can you expect to retain over the next two or three years?
This is a really good question and one that you should ask
any ATM vendor you might be considering. You'll have to consider
a couple of purchases as short-term buys.

Since ABR has to take place in hardware, any NIC or ATM edge
device (such as an Ethernet to ATM switch) will either need
a significant upgrade or need to be replaced. This is because
ABR would be done by the same hardware that does segmentation
and reassembly of packets (so-called SAR chips). Chip vendors
are now working on developing new SAR chips that include ABR,
but don't expect to see NICs and edge devices that use the
new chips until the end of the year.

ABR is a particularly important specification, as it allows
ATM networks to handle the bursty traffic that is commonly
seen in packet-based networks. Without the ability to slow
data sources at the ATM level, an ATM-based network may not
perform well at all. Let's say your ATM switch starts getting
busy and has to discard 3 percent of cells received. Most of
us have observed packet retry rates up to 3 percent, right?
If you further imagine that your average packet is 512 bytes
and gets broken down to 120 or so cells, the chance of one
cell in every packet being discarded is fairly high. The useful
throughput of your ATM network becomes small and goes down
as the average size of your data packet goes up-not quite the
sort of behavior to which we're accustomed.

TCP/IP has its own throttling mechanisms, so as packets get
trashed, TCP/IP will back off. However, that may result in
getting less than optimal bandwidth use as well. Few other
protocols have throttling mechanisms, and so ABR's is a highly
valuable function. This is not to say that you can't build
a functional network without it. You'll just build a better
one with it.

Some vendors have come up with proprietary ways to handle the
cell discard problem. Cisco, for example, has a technique called
early packet discard. The technique essentially attempts to
drop all cells from a single packet, thus considerably upping
the chances for getting other packets through the switch intact.

So Is Now the Time to Jump in and Buy?

I think so. I'm urging the folks that I work with to replace
our routers with Ethernet and ATM switches this summer. The
benefits of virtual LANs, greatly expanded bandwidth and manageability
seem just too enticing. Replacing old routers with new routers
is expensive and doesn't deliver the flexibility that we'll
demand from our network in the next three to four years.

A couple of years ago, I wrote an article saying that 1997 would
be about the right time frame to consider buying ATM. I was
wrong by about six months. Mid-1996 is a good time to start
buying and now is a good time to start planning. You're probably
still looking at a single-vendor solution, but that's OK. Most
of us chose a single-vendor solution anyway. Ask the hard questions
and make sure that vendor is doing the work to protect your
investment. Accept that you'll replace some of the stuff you
buy, but don't be afraid that you won't get a functional network
in the end. n

Middleware & Cross-Platform Development: To DB2 From The Desktop: Too Many Ways

By:
Bruce Robertson

There are many ways to get to DB2-too many ways. Since
the mainframe is still by far the largest data repository in
most corporations, and DB2 is IBM's widely used RDBMS for the
mainframe, getting to DB2 has become the number one target
for third-party middleware vendors. Not surprisingly, since
those DB2 solutions usually involve purchasing additional software
for the mainframe, the price tag is often $10,000 or more,
and sometimes more than $100,000. It will pay to choose wisely.

Unfortunately, corporations usually approach the problem of
accessing DB2 data by assuming they need DB2 data to look like
tables in some ODBC-enabled desktop tool like Excel or Access,
or even an in-house developed PowerBuilder application. Such
data may indeed be in a row or a table in DB2 and may end up
being in a table in Excel or Access, or on a screen in the
PowerBuilder application. But getting between the two doesn't
mean that the DB2 table must be visible to any of these desktop
tools.

Traditional data access middleware does make DB2 tables directly
visible to the desktop query tools. Other middleware (message
oriented, RPC-based, TP monitors and even some day Object Request
Brokers) can also bring data down to the desktop, but without
letting the user see the tables in DB2 directly. 3270 screen
scraping products, along with other GUI distribution options
like Web forms to RDBMS links, can also get DB2 data down to
the desktop. Finally, replication solutions can copy the data
down to the desktop for local access.

There are a lot of options. Which one is right for you depends
on strengths and weaknesses of each access option and particular
product when evaluated in the context of the real need of the
organization. Let's take a look at each DB2 data-to-desktop
approach.

IBM DRDA for Direct Data Access to DB2

There are many products that offer direct data access to DB2
data. Some are specific to DB2; others also support access
to other nonrelational data sources like IMS or ADABAS on the
mainframe. For still others, DB2 is just another remote database
on another platform their middleware supports. There are at
least some basic distinguishing technology solutions, however,
that provide a road map for the many products.

First, look to IBM. After all, it's IBM's database. And IBM's
mainframe.

Distributed Relational Data Architecture (DRDA) is IBM's middleware
technology for connecting its DB2 databases. DRDA products
go beyond mainframe DB2 connectivity, accessing DB2/400, DB2
6000, SQL/DS and any other DRDA-enabled database. The mainframe
DRDA server component is bundled with DB2 now, so there's no
additional mainframe software cost to stomach. IBM has even
submitted DRDA to X/Open for consideration as a database networking
standard.

But, while IBM gives OS/2 desktops a native DRDA requester,
Windows clients must connect via an intermediate OS/2 gateway
machine running IBM's DDCS/2 software, depicted to the left.
This intermediate gateway approach does not require APPC and
LU 6.2 on each client, but the gateway itself can become a
bottleneck under significant transaction load or large result
downloads. Moreover, OS/2 might not be a strategic OS choice
for your organization.

The new option is to avoid the full gateway approach. Third
parties like Wall Data and Rocket Software have taken advantage
of DRDA's openness to create native Windows DRDA requesters
sporting the ODBC interface. StarWave's StarSQL connects over
DRDA's APPC network, but it can handle non-LU 6.2 clients via
Microsoft SNA Server on NT or other SNA gateway products, as
shown in the first figure below. Wall Data's RUMBA for Database
Access supports APPC connections over TCP/IP to the mainframe
using IBM's new AnyNet technology.

Proprietary Direct Data Access to DB2

Outside of DRDA options, many vendors have proprietary DB2 connectivity
products. Many, but not all, offer more functionality than
DB2 alone, particularly the stored procedures (including returned
data) that are not yet supported in DB2. To do this, these
products include an expensive separate host component. With
the host component handling the processing, predefined queries
(static SQL or DB2 plans) can be executed on the host for better
performance along with lower host and network utilization.

Third-party database gateways are typically more functional
and flexible than IBM's DDCS/2. The venerable Micro DecisionWare
Database Gateway, for example, is being slowly reincarnated
by new owner Sybase. The Database Gateway's APPC/LU6.2 connection
to the mainframe consolidates connections from Sybase/Microsoft
DB-Library and ODBC clients, depicted in the middle figure
below. Those clients (Windows, Mac, DOS, OS/2 and Unix) can
connect over IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, AppleTalk, VINES IP and NetBEUI
NetBIOS to the Database Gateway server (running on OS/2, Windows
NT or AIX). Not all client/protocol/gateway combinations support
all these options, but TCP/IP works on all. Since Sybase's
own dialect of SQL is used, DB2 ends up looking like a Sybase
database for direct data access. By writing separate CICS programs
to query DB2 (and other) data or to execute existing CICS transactions,
remote stored procedure calls from clients can be handled.

Similar proprietary gateway connections are available from the
usual middleware data access suspects: IBI EDA/SQL, TechGnosis
SequeLink, IBM's new Data Joiner, Cross Access, Digital AccessWorks,
Software AG Entire Access, NetWeave, Independence Technology
DAL, XDB XDB-Link, Oracle and many others. Cross Access and
EDA/SQL support host-based query governor options to keep DB2
from being overcome by ad-hoc transactions rather than OLTP
interaction.

There is a more direct approach, however. Neon Software's Shadow
Direct supports direct TCP/IP access from desktop to mainframe
DB2 data. The direct proprietary approach eliminates gateway
and APPC complications. Like Thomson Software's ODB/Server,
but unlike most proprietary gateway solutions, Shadow Direct's
host component does not run in CICS and provides greater performance
since it is multithreaded, unlike CICS itself. Enhanced manageability
is available while more control is offered through limits on
CPU resources (by session and query), rows/query throttles,
and timeouts for inactivity or long queries. Shadow Direct
even generates System Management Facility data for monitoring
and accounting use. The Neon solution can be seen in the bottom
figure to the left.

Though Neon does not handle as many data sources as EDA/SQL
and SequeLink, it does supply a unique automatic way to use
DB2 plans from existing applications for higher performance
on OLTP activities along with optimized ODBC catalogs. Moreover,
Neon provides programmatic links to stored procedures processed
by its server, or to code running in other subsystems like
CICS or IMS.

DB2 Procedural Access to DB2

For many applications, letting users see DB2 directly opens
up a big can of worms. Users can bog the mainframe down with
poorly designed ad-hoc queries. Shielding DB2 data behind new
or old/reused functions or stored procedures is a better approach,
since users can only execute queries predefined by IS personnel.
Moreover, this can offload the mainframe better than many other
middleware options. Future applications are more likely to
use a three-tier architecture, where clients talk to an intermediate
application server, and that server makes requests from DB2
and other resources as necessary. This approach can be seen
in the first figure on page 156. DB2 won't need to be seen
as a table to applications anymore. In fact, applications won't
need to see DB2 at all-they'll just see other applications.

As noted, data access middleware products increasingly support
SQL-specific stored procedures or can call other CICS-coded
transactions along with their direct data access. More generic
middleware products, in contrast, offer full programmatic access
to the mainframe with a wider variety of networking, API and
programming tool options but offer no direct data access to
DB2. Existing business rules and code can be reused by distributed
applications instead of the original terminal applications
for which they were written. Most message-oriented, RPC-based
and distributed transaction monitor products also allow the
mainframe to be a direct and equal partner in the distributed
application development environment.

DB2 Via 3270 Applications

A variety of products offer the ability to retrofit existing
character-based terminal applications (accessing DB2 data or
anything else) by mapping 3270 structured fields into GUI screens
or even fields in database tables. When an ODBC or other directly
enabled application asks for a record, the client-based subsystem
actually calls up appropriate 3270 screens and captures data
off them. No work or extra software license money is spent
on the host side (where software gets expensive quickly), and
desktops don't need LAN access to the mainframe. Changes to
the original 3270 applications, however, break screen-scraper
applications. For most situations, screen scraping is only
an interim solution to get a GUI face on an old application.

DB2 Via the Web

A major new category of database access uses Web forms. Using
products such as IBM DB2 WWW, IBM/Lotus InterNotes Web Publisher,
Allaire Cold Fusion, Aspect Software dbWeb, ExperTelligence
WebBase and others, a Web form can trigger a DB2 query, although
work has to be done to map DB2 fields to fields on the form
presented to the user by the Web server, as depicted in the
middle figure below. The user, however, requires no new software
for DB2 access beyond the Web browser.

This Web-specific, three-tier approach offers wide leverage
via Internet access and Web ubiquity, but current products
sacrifice security or performance. The no client software approach
is a return to the terminal emulation world in a sense, with
3270 replaced by the new Web terminal over TCP/IP and the Internet.
The quick deployment opportunity (no software to be deployed
to all the clients) and leveraging of the Internet makes Web
access to DB2 data an attractive alternative to consider. You
can collect data from desktops you can't control. But the user
can't easily use that data in client-based applications. Web
forms also don't offer all the control and functionality that
a carefully constructed client application written in PowerBuilder
can. Forms may not be able to offer local data validation,
and Web browsers like Netscape still don't let a user tab from
field to field while simultaneously scrolling the screen.

E-mail accessible rules processors like BeyondMail can offer
another style of ubiquitous access. As with Web forms, however,
developers will be unhappy with the user interface options
and control. But it's a good alternative when wide access is
more important than performance.

DB2 Access by Replication

A final option for accessing DB2 data is to have a system that
moves or copies that data out to the desktop or other LAN-based
RDBMS servers. Instead of accessing DB2 data where it is, replication
products bring the data to you, as shown in the last figure
below. Local access can be much speedier and completely offloads
the mainframe, which can be great for decision support or heavy
data analysis applications. Data can also be simplified and
clarified as it's copied. Sybase's recently shipped Replication
Server for DB2 supports real-time data synchronization at the
transaction level. Oracle, IBM DataPropogator Relational, Trinsic
InfoPump, Praxis OmniReplicator and others offer replication,
and many support Lotus Notes.

Unfortunately, data synchronization is a difficult task, and
most corporations aren't prepared to handle data updates back
to the mainframe via replication. So, replication is often
stuck into a read-only copy function.

Net Results: The Sweet Music Of Network Management

By:
Dave Molta

Once every year my son's school holds a career day. You know,
this is where mothers and fathers who are doctors or police
officers or pilots come and tell the kids what it's like in
the real world. My basketball buddy Jim is an air traffic controller
and he brings in some airplane models that draw plenty of oohs
and ahs from the kids. I considered bringing in a 10BASE-T
hub, but decided that it just wouldn't have the same effect.
Ah, the life of a network manager: plenty of guts, but not
much glory.

Welcome to my first Network Computing column. Some of you may
recognize my name. After all, I've been writing reviews, features
and workshops for several years now. Twenty years ago, I went
to college to study electrical engineering and somehow ended
up with a degree in music. After I discovered that I was more
likely to end up a high school marching band director than
the lead trombonist on the Tonight Show, I caught the wave
of personal computers and networking and never looked back.
Today, I manage the network at Syracuse University, one of
the magazine's distributed lab sites, though I often feel like
it's managing me. "So what exactly do you do at your job?"
my son asks. "Well, it's kind of complicated, Danny. Now go
practice your trumpet." He doesn't press the issue. He's happy,
especially when daddy comes home with Orangemen season tickets.

Here at Syracuse, we're in the third year of a fairly ambitious
migration from mainframe to client/server-based systems. The
ride's been fast and rough. Deploying new technology, managing
a fast-changing systems environment and developing a culture
that views change as positive: These are the key challenges
we face, and I like to think that we're coming to grips with
all three.

On the technology front, we're building and rebuilding network
and systems infrastructure, doubling the number of Ethernet
connections each of the past three years to around 5,000 today,
deploying wide-area links, ATM, wireless, database servers,
Web technologies, you name it. We've phased out old systems,
including a fairly large VAX/VMS complex and an IBM 3090 mainframe
and replaced much of their functionality with Unix, NetWare
and NT servers.

Here's a shocker: Managing these changes hasn't been easy, neither
for my technical staff nor for our internal customers. We've
had to invent new ways of doing business, pushing expertise
and support out closer to where the real work of the organization
gets done, and retraining many of our staff in new technologies.
This has all taken place during an era of significant budget
cuts, forcing tough choices on priorities. In our efforts to
adapt, we've consolidated units, flattened our central computing
organization, embraced total quality management-and lived to
tell about it.

I know what some of you are thinking: It's a university. You
can afford to take chances on new technologies. People are
accustomed to frequent system changes and unexpected downtime.
Don't we wish! We may be willing to bleed at the edge a bit
more than some, but make no mistake about it, we have a business
to run, or so I'm told on a daily basis.

Call Me When It Breaks

I once knew a technical engineer whom I'll call Bill. Bill was
a technical genius, a guru if you will. He was proud of the
network he had designed and built and he could fix any problem
that might arise. As I got to know Bill a little better, I
learned that Bill's motto was, "Tell me when it's broke and
I'll gladly fix it." You gotta love a guy with an attitude
like that, right?

Wrong. I love people who design systems that don't develop problems
that need fixing. I'm talking about systems that are well planned
and implemented, fault tolerant, rock solid. Is this too much
to ask? Probably. Is it a worthy goal to aim for? I think so.
The problem is that we're not as good as we need to be at this
and I bet you're not either. Why? I'll offer the following
triad: people, technology and resources.

Like it or not, there's a shortage of qualified technical professionals
with knowledge of networking and client/server technologies
in today's market. A network administrator who had been with
me less than two years left recently for a job that paid nearly
$20,000 a year more than we did. One of our best client/server
project leaders recently received a competitive offer to increase
her salary by $30,000. Can any of you relate to this? Finding
good people and holding on to them is a monumental task for
most organizations trying to migrate to client/server technologies.

How do you deal with this situation? One good strategy comes
from Tom Landry, the former Dallas Cowboys coach. While other
teams were drafting players to fill holes in their team, Landry
would focus on selecting the best athlete available at the
draft. The point was to find a quality person you could train
to fill your needs. If you limit your search to people with
specific jobs skills, you'll either have to break the budget
or settle for mediocrity. The key is to find quality people
who can develop skills you'll need. In the long run, you build
a better organization. The same principle holds true when you
phase out old systems. I'll bet that you'll be better off in
the long run if you retrain that VM systems programmer to do
Unix or NetWare or NT rather than look for someone new with
the specific skills you need.

The Technology Tap Dance

I'm tired of all those seminars stressing the importance of
aligning technology and business goals and meeting the customer's
needs. I don't take issue with the fundamental assertions,
but they're too simplistic. Sure, we have to remember the bottom
line, but we also have to be realistic about what's possible
with technology and what's not. We have to be selective in
what we deploy, because the bottom line for most organizations
is making it work-every day. Try to be all things to all people
and you're likely to find yourself in the midst of two angry
mobs: your staff and your internal customers.

Being a successful network manager is about making good technology
decisions. Over time, most managers realize they can't do it
alone. It requires teamwork, delegation of authority, communication
and organization of peoples' efforts. It also requires some
good instincts in selecting which vendors are blowing smoke
and which ones are in it for the long haul. Most of us became
technical managers on the basis of our technical skills rather
than our managerial acumen. No wonder some of the brightest
minds in my organization want no part of management.

Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about all the great
things my organization could do with a few more people, more
capital resources or a slightly larger operating budget. Don't
delude yourself into believing that your budget is more sacred
than anyone else's. Yes, network computing is strategic to
the enterprise, but so are a lot of other things. Focus your
efforts first on getting the most out of what you've already
got. Once you've done that and there is still a need, you've
got a more compelling case to make to management.

On the other side of the fence are those "lucky" enough to be
in high-growth organizations. I've been there, too, and it
isn't all it's cracked up to be. Too often, the pace of growth
is simply too fast to manage effectively. Lots of organizations
make an all-too-quick transition from "on fire" to "burnt out."
It comes down to making the right decisions about people and
technology, and managing your resources effectively.

My buddy Jim moved recently, so I don't know what they'll do
on career day at Danny's school. I could tell the kids how
exciting it is to decide between switching or routing for our
next backbone infrastructure. Or maybe I'll just dig out my
old trombone.

E-Mail & Messaging: Adding Interactive Services To Your Web Server

By:
Eric Hall

Look around the World Wide Web, and most of what you'll find
today are online equivalents of printed propaganda. There may
also be some downloadable files or imagesas well as the seemingly
requisite overabundance of hypertext links to every imaginable
corner of the Internet. But, for the most part, Web servers
are about as interactive as their paper-based counterparts.

While getting to this level of highly-functional-yet-somewhat
interoperable online publishing can seem miraculous to many,
it is far from where these systems need to be if they are ever
to be something more than an outlet for marketing's creativity.
In order for the Web to become the next-generation platform
for distributed computing, it must go beyond read-only into
the world of interactive. Users should be able to add, edit
and delete data in real time, as security and application locking
allow.

We'll outline some of the concepts and technologies to help
you get there today. We'll also look at some basic examples,
and provide pointers to other materials where appropriate and
available. By no means can we cover everything. We will attempt
to give you enough information so that you can get started
in the right direction.

"What kinds of applications can be called from the server, and
where can they be found?" These are the two most common questions
asked at this point. Before we can answer these questions,
we must first look at how the server and applications communicate.

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

Most, but not all, Web servers have two basic methods of handling
back-end data. They either read a file or communicate with
other programs through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).
It's up to the application to figure out what to do with that
data, and to return HTML to the server. This is an extremely
simplistic overview of the process, and there are many possible
exceptions and extensions.

Examples of CGI can be seen on many servers today. Clickable
image maps such as those found on Network Computing's home
page http://techweb.cmp.com/nc/current use CGI. As you can
see in the figure "Clickable Image Maps," the client sends
an HTTP request containing the URL and XY coordinates to the
server, which passes the coordinates to a local application.
The application executes an event that has been associated
with those coordinates and returns HTML to the server for delivery
to the client. In the case of image maps, most of the time
this HTML data consists of an HTTP redirect command that instructs
the client to request another document from the servers.

Another common use of CGI is for searching through files or
databases (Yahoo and WebCrawler are good examples). A user
constructs a query that is sent to the server, which then spawns
an application that conducts the actual search and returns
the "hits" in HTML form.

So, to answer the question about the kinds of applications that
can be called by the server: They include any application that
supports CGI on the front end and can generate HTML responses.
In fact, you can call almost any program you want, as long
as it supports command-line operation.

However, the unfortunate truth is that no two Web servers are
alike. They have all been developed with specific audiences
in mind and "enhanced" to suit those markets. This means that
just because something works with server brand X does not mean
that it will work with server brand Y. For example, there are
considerable differences between the Netscape server's CGI
interface and the O'Reilly and Associates WebSite server's
CGI interface, even though they both use Windows NT's CMD.EXE
command interpreter. The differences between the various Unix
shells, Digital's DCL, DOS' COMMAND.COM, and all other platforms,
can also impact what you want to do.

CGI Detailed: GET Vs. POST

One of the most common methods of implementing CGI is through
the use of GETs and POSTs. In the "Clickable Image Map" figure,
the client submitted a URL with a question mark and XY coordinates
appended to the end. This method of CGI call is known as a
GET. Not only are GETs the oldest, but they are also the default
and easiest to implement. Another form of call, known as POST
has become more popular, and is generally considered to be
much more powerful. The differences between them are subtle,
but significant.

The GET method is named for what the client does. It asks the
server to GET the HTML document at HTTP://URL?Param. The server
sees that the URL points to an executable, calls it and passes
it the parameters.

In contrast, the POST method is used when the client submits
a block of data to the server. The client is not necessarily
assuming that anything will be returned to it, although the
connection is still open. In most cases, the server's Webmaster
has configured things so that the client is given a thank you
message, or response data is sent to the client.

CGI Examples

Let's walk through an example using O'Reilly and Associates
WebSite server, since its use of Windows NT's CMD.EXE makes
it easy to write simplistic demonstration scripts. WebSite
can also run on Windows 95, so it's easy to use on a personal
system for learning purposes. Besides, you can evaluate it
free for 60 days. It's available at http://website.ora.com.

Once the WebSite Manager is downloaded, use the administrative
tool to locate the directory for DOS executables (C:\WEBSITE\CGI
DOS is the default). Using NotePad or some other text editor,
create a file called DIRSEARCH.CMD in that directory and carefully
copy the contents of the "Sample File: DIRSEARCH.CMD" figure
and save the file. Using a Web client, connect to your server
and point to http://
/DOS-CGI/DIRSEARCH.CMD. Assuming that your server is configured
to allow your client to access DOS-based CGI scripts, you should
get an HTML page stating No Files Specified. Don't worry. This
is what we want! Connect again and this time add ?command.com
to the end. You should see a standard directory listing of
all the files named command.com. DIRSEARCH.CMD is a simple
NT batch file that scans your server's C: drive for any occurrence
of a specified file and returns the directory list to the user.
If a file is not specified, then an error message is displayed.
We'll extend this program later, but first we need to examine
it in detail.

Always Test the Data First

The first line in the box below is a parameter test to make
sure that a user has supplied a filename. If "%1" is blank
(that is, does not exist), then the batch file jumps to the
:errlabel label, which returns an error message to the user.
Any seasoned programmer will tell you that it's important to
test your program inputs before acting on them, and it is even
more crucial here for several reasons.

Most important is an open issue regarding system security. There
are known weaknesses with many operating systems that allow
shell metacharacters to break your script or a called application,
thereby exposing your system. It sounds far-fetched, but it
happens all the time. By adding keystroke traps to your script,
however, you can go a long way toward preventing this from
happening. Refer to the CERT archives for more information
on this subject. This weakness is not prevalent on all systems,
but it is on many of them.

Another good reason to test the parameters is for program control.
As we'll show below, you can use this function to minimize
your development. Finally, there's a programming reason to
test the input: to make sure that the data is valid. If instead
of conducting a directory search, you queried a database, you
would want to make sure that all of the necessary information
had been provided. Testing the data in a script is more efficient
than letting the called application fail. You would still have
to test for errors, so you might as well do it up front.

Define Your MIME Type

The use of MIME types to coordinate data exchange is now part
of the HTTP specification, as of version 1.0. As you can see,
both the :goodlabel and :errlabel sections begin with MIME
type declarations echoed to STDOUT.

For our purposes, we are simply declaring that the following
data is HTML. The Web client interprets this and knows to read
and apply whatever HTML formatting tags it sees in the data.
If the MIME type had not been declared, then your browser may
or may not interpret the HTML tags.

As you may have guessed, you can also send binaries or other
nontext data back to the client. For example, if you wanted
to return a GIF image, you would define the MIME content-type
as Image/GIF. The client would then receive and display the
image appropriately. Likewise, you could send application binaries
by using the Application/Octet-stream MIME type, and so on.
Note the echo statement that follows the MIME declaration.
You must send a blank line after you send the content-type
 statement.

The Rest of It

The remaining code is fairly self explanatory.  There are,
however, some things worth noting.  the < and > characters are
proceeded by ^.  This is to prevent CMD.EXE from interpreting
them as redirection commands.  Also notice that the DIR C:\"%1"/s
is the actual command that we are calling.  The remaining lines
of code are used to prepare the environment and command line, as
well as generate HTML on its behalf.

Image map servers and dynamic directory builders are two of
the more common CGI-aware applications that you'll find. Additionally,
there are a variety of third-party tools, such as database
requesters and indexed searching agents, available on the Internet.
If you wish to write your own, you can apply the same concepts
we've shown you to a compiled language.

Adding Support for Forms

In its current form, DIRSEARCH.CMD must be given a parameter
on the URL's command line. This is far from intuitive, and
if you made your users work like this, you'd have very little
traffic on your site. Most users prefer to enter information
on a form, and so do administrators, since the level of control
increases tremendously.

The easiest way to build a form is through the use of the <ISINDEX> 
HTML tag. This simple tag has the delightful affect of putting
an edit box widget on your page. When a user enters text into
the edit box and presses the enter key, the text is appended
to the URL (with the question mark), and the page is reloaded.
At this point, a valid search string exists, and the script
will process accordingly.

For our example, change the line in the figure " EACH.CMD" that
reads ^<H1^>No Files Specified^</H1^> to Enter a filename to
search for:  ^<ISINDEX^>.  Now point your Web browser to
/BIN/CGI-DOS/DIR SEARCH, and you will be greeted with an edit
box.  Type in COMMAND.COM and press enter, and the same script
will now branch through the :goodlabel section, and return a
directory listing.

Don't be confused by the name ISINDEX, it's an unfortunate
moniker for such a flexible gizmo.  This tag does not
automatically make your documents searchable; some other tool
(such as DIR, in our case) must do the searching if that's what
you want.  The <ISINDEX> simply provides an edit box whose contents
are appended to the current URL.

Just as the <ISINDEX> tag is poorly named, so is it poorly
treated by most browsers.  Many of them prepend the edit box with
an inane comment about the document being searchable, which is
just plain wrong.  In order for us to have an attractive form
that doesn't confuse people, we'll have to use "real" forms.

Creating Real HTML Forms

Form creation with HTML is a fairly simple task, and as we've
shown, passing data with CGI is also straightforward. When
you combine these two components' simplicity and strength,
tremendous results can develop.

In order to illustrate this, we need to modify our sample code.
Edit DIRSEARCH.CMD once again, and replace the <ISINDEX> 
tag with the code shown in the figure "ISINDEX Replacement".

Save these changes, and reload our now familiar URL.  Now,
instead of seeing an <ISINDEX> input field, you should see a real
HTML form.  When you enter a file name into the edit box and
click on the "submit" button, the script will process the
directory search and return the list of matching files.

Let's examine this syntax in detail.  The line that contains the
<Form> HTML tag does what you might guess:  It notifies the
client that the following text contains form elements, until a
closing </Form> tag is encountered.

There are additional keywords that can be used with the <Form> 
tag, which provide greater amounts of control. One of these
is the Action= statement, which tells the browser where to
send the form contents. By default, the destination is a URL
but it could be any CGI application available to the user.
For companies that have several distributed Web servers, but
only one or two CGI servers, this is a great way to split the
load. Also of importance is the Method= keyword, which allows
you to specify that the query data is to be submitted using
the GET or POST methods as described earlier.

Widget Lingo

Another keyword, the <Input> tag, has many options, but it
basically applies to almost every type of form widget available.
This includes edit boxes, radio buttons, check boxes and command
buttons.  The only types of widgets not controlled by <Input> are
list boxes (either drop-down or scrollable) and large, multi line
text boxes, both of which have their own specific tags.

In our example, the first occurrence reads <Input
Name="FILENAME"> .  This syntax will create an edit box with the
resource name of Filename.  The Name= command associates a name
with the control data.  After successfully running a query, look
at the client's URL command line.  Notice that where it used to
have ?command.com, it now has ?filename=command.com.  One final
thing to remember about the Name= option is that it does not
apply to command buttons (you'll see why in a moment)

Notice that we did not explicitly declare the edit box as such.
That's because the default of <Input> widget is an edit box.  If
we chose to do so, we would declare it using the Type=Text
attribute.  Other valid Type= declarations include Password
fields (like edit boxes, only keystrokes are echoed as
asterisks), CheckBox, Radio, Submit and Reset.

Additionally, we could preload a string into the edit box by
using the Value= statement. This can also be used with password
fields, as well as checkboxes, radio buttons and command buttons,
although its usage varies widely among them.

The default width (in theory, at least) of an edit box is 20
characters, and the height is one. You can define different
sizes using the Size= directive. When setting the width, use
Size=W. When setting the height, use Size=W,H. Note that setting
the width does not restrict input to that amount of characters,
but instead defines the width of the box itself.

One problem with the GET method is that text is appended to
the URL as entered. If you let the user enter as much as they
want, you run the risk of script or called application failure
due to overflown buffers. The Maxlength= attribute is useful
for limiting the maximum number of characters that an edit
box will accept, thereby limiting your system's exposure.

Altogether, our listic <Input Name="FILENAME"> example could (and
probably should) read as <Input Type="TEXT" Name="FILENAME"
Width=20 Maxlength=20>.  Note the use of quote marks around the
textual values; this is an HTML requirement that needs to be
followed for maximum compatibility.

Command Buttons

Command buttons are not nearly as complex as the edit boxes;
there are only two possible types.  Our example uses the
Type="Submit" variety, which builds the parameter list and
appends it to the URL specified by the <Form Action=...>  tag.
The other type of command button is Type="Reset", which clears
the form and resets all of the widgets to their original state.

The only optional attribute that can be set for command buttons
is Value=.  In this case, the Value= attribute defines the text
that appears on the button's face.  It does not change the
button's behavior.  For our example, we could change <Input
Type="Submit"> to <Input Type="Submit" Value="Search"> , and add
another button that cleared the editbox by using <Input
Type="Reset" Value="Clear">.

And Then Some

You should experiment with the different types of widgets and
their optional parameters. Together they provide a fairly comprehensive
set of tools for getting user input into your CGI scripts and
applications. A good starting place is http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu
 SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/ overview.html, and
by searching Yahoo's (http://www.yahoo.com) database for "HTML
and Forms."

Anyone familiar with other types of graphical forms-based tools
will tell you that these gizmos, while handy, are hardly sufficient.
New extensions have been added to the HTML drafts that address
some concerns, but not all. Vendors are stepping up with products
that address these concerns, however, so you should be able
to find something that suits your need.

On the back end, Lotus Development and Netscape have both promised
to ship HTML filters for their respective groupware products,
allowing you to leverage in-form value testing, mathematical
functions and the like. How these extensions will be handled
by generic clients is anybody's guess. But it is a step in
the right direction.

As for the clients, Netscape Navigator 2.0 and Oracle's PowerBrowser
clients both promise to offer event-driven scripting language
extensions that will allow Webmasters to embed extended controls
into the forms directly. Although these clients will perform
the functions as directed, it means more work for the administrators,
since you may have to support multiple proprietary extensions.
Again, it's a step that will drive further standards-based
development.

GET vs. POST Revisited

We have been using the GET method to pass data down to our
script.  The POST method, which offers more capabilities,
deserves some attention as well.  To see a quick demonstration,
the <Form...>  line in DIRSEARCH.CMD to read <Form Method="POST"
Action= "BIN/CGI-DOS/DIRSEARCH"> , and reload the form again.
This won't the behavior of your script, but you may receive a
security notice from your client.

Remember, we've been using O'Reilly's WebSite. It's CGI interface
to CMD.EXE is relatively consistent between POST and GET. However,
there is one significant difference. WebSite manager generates
a unique temporary file that contains the data provided during
the post operation. You can sniff through this output file
on a programmatic basis if needed, allowing your script to
branch according to content. This is extremely handy if you
have to allow users to submit large strings of text or binary
objects.

Beyond Simple CGI

GET and POST both offer value, depending on your objectives.
However, in this implementation they are also both limited
in that they rely on NT's CMD.EXE, a character-based command
interpreter, as well as require that scripts and applications
support the use of STDIN and STDOUT. This precludes the use
of Windows-based applications as CGI-callable services.

A handful of vendors are working together to develop WIN-CGI
to circumvent this problem. Implemented as a CGI-aware library,
you can extend any application for which you have the source
code, recompiling it to read and write CGI instead of the more
traditional I/O interfaces. Such efforts aren't new. Many sources
are available for CGI libraries for various servers and operating
systems. Contact your Web server vendor for leads.

Now that you understand some of the concepts behind CGI programming,
you should be able to develop applications that communicate
between the Web and any data system. Remember to follow the
specifications, and do a lot of testing, and you'll come out
ahead.

Fast Networking: Appearing In The NIC Of Time

By:
Art Wittmann

It's amazing that it took this long, but it's finally here,
and at a price almost anyone can afford. It's fast networking
100 Mbps or faster to be exact, and it's about time. Ethernet
and Token-Ring have been around roughly as long as the IBM
PC and its derivatives, and they just don't cut it as a backbone
technology anymore.

Ten years ago, if anyone told me that processors would increase
in power by 500 times and we'd still use the same networking,
I would have laughed. Yet, that's exactly what happened. We
went from the .2 MIPS of the 8088 to the 100 MIPS of the Pentium,
and Ethernet and Token-Ring have been with us all the way.

It's time for a change. Every desktop computer sporting a 486
or better can saturate a 4-Mbps or 10-Mbps pipe, and most newer
servers and power workstations can do a fairly good job on
a 100-Mbps pipe. More important, we now have applications that
can actually take advantage of that speed. Multimedia, databases,
graphically intensive you-name-it all can suck up lots of bandwidth.
End stations need either fast connections or exclusive access
to their own Ethernet or Token-Ring segments. Servers need
high-speed connections, as their clients can and do pull so
much data from them quickly.

The products are new, and with anything new in our industry,
caution is the key word. The package may say 100 Mbps, but
your actual performance could be only slightly better than
it was with your old network. Let's look at some of the important
considerations.

Even considering fast networking for ISA-based computers makes
almost no sense. In practice, most ISA systems, whether servers
or workstations, are cooking along pretty well if they fill
a Token-Ring or Ethernet pipe. Their chances of taking advantage
of more bandwidth are slim. On the other hand, if the technology
you choose is a shared medium, like Fast Ethernet or FDDI,
then upgrading an ISA system may make some sense. Fast Ethernet
in such a system makes more sense than FDDI, since an FDDI
card will probably cost as much as or more than your ISA system
is worth. And, please, don't even talk about ATM on ISA, at
least not yet.

EISA, PCI and most of the RISC workstation buses can take significant
advantage of fast networking, and here is where it will shine.
We've found EISA systems that can move more than 70 Mbps through
an FDDI card, as well as PCI and SBus systems that can move
more than 90 Mbps. The resultant workload on your processor
is likely to be significantly different, however, depending
on the bus you pick. Due to much higher throughput rates and
low latency, we found that bus mastering PCI cards are likely
to impact the system bus 70 percent to 90 percent less than
EISA cards.

Your mileage may vary depending on the quality of the drivers
involved. As a general rule, buses like PCI are more suited
to processors like the Pentium and P6, and we should mention
the Alpha, PowerPC and MIPS 4000 processors as well. Video,
fast networking and SCSI cards all will leave more of the CPU's
time for your application on PCI vs. EISA, ISA or MCA.

An interesting rule of thumb says that any given processor can
move about the same number of megabits of data as its MIPS
rating. So, if you want a processor that can move at 100 Mbps
or faster, you'd better have a 100-MIPS processor. In practice,
this turns out to be a fairly good rule of thumb. While generally
you'll get better performance running a performance benchmark,
real-life numbers usually will follow the rule. So, don't expect
your old 25-MHz 486 to take full advantage of these technologies.
It takes a pretty speedy chip to really shine through.

Even with a fast processor, it takes a good OS/driver and protocol
implementation to get the most out of a high-speed NIC. TCP
IP is a good example of a protocol that will turn in good numbers.
Novell's IPX, with its burst mode, will do well. However, its
older SPX-I protocol is too slow to be helped much by a fast
NIC. SPX-II is much better, but it isn't used much in practice.
AppleTalk isn't too bad, since several packets can be sent
before an acknowledgment is required, but it is limited to
512-byte packets, which slows it down significantly. What slows
AppleTalk down even more is the OS to which it's tied.

Which Type of Fast Networking?

Fast networking is a good catchall phrase, but we shouldn't
indiscriminately combine all of the technologies included in
this Buyer's Guide. Here's a quick look at the pros and cons
of the five major players.

FDDI is the granddaddy of the fast networking topologies. FDDI
is an acronym for Fiber Distributed Data Interconnect, and
it was designed as a high-availability shared media system.
With its token-ring architecture, small rings can deliver up
to 98 percent of the 100 Mbps for data, and even the largest
rings will deliver upward of 90 percent of the available 100
Mbps. Furthermore, developing a fault-tolerant backbone is
fairly easy because of FDDI's dual-ring architecture.

FDDI has also been standardized for Category 5 twisted-pair
cabling. Building fiber-based backbones with servers and routers
connected to concentrators via copper wiring is a method for
building larger networks today. The down side to FDDI is its
price. It is expensive, and it isn't likely to get much cheaper
in the near future. It is, however, well tested and well accepted.

If FDDI is the old man of the pack, ATM is the young whiz kid
who thinks he has all the answers. Unlike FDDI, ATM is purely
a switched medium, allowing only an ATM switch and end station
to share the bandwidth of any one physical port. In our guide,
that means every station will get unfettered access to full
duplex 100 Mbps or 155 Mbps. As ATM matures, it also promises
to deliver mechanisms for negotiating point-to-point connections
with an assured quality of service. So, if you've got an application
that needs to continuously transfer 40 Mbps to some station
across the network, your application can make a request for
such a connection and the bandwidth will be reserved for you.

The technology is not mature, and buying ATM now is living on
the bleeding edge. ATM is still expensive, but the prices are
dropping quickly. ATM will no doubt dominate backbone technologies
in a few years, but whether or not it's worth the investment
to bring it to the desktop is a tough question.

Fibre Channel is the speed demon's dream. Its present top speed
is 800 Mbps. Only a few applications really need this kind
of speed. Distributed parallel processing is one. Medical imaging
may be another. The animation folks in Hollywood have looked
at it, too. If your applications really need speed, and you've
invested in the very best hardware, Fibre Channel may be a
good choice. However, don't think about it for your servers
on a backbone, at least not yet. No major vendors currently
are shipping Fibre Channel boards for routers, so getting from
Fibre Channel to anything else can be difficult.

100VG-AnyLAN is a specification that Hewlett-Packard championed
as a rival to Fast Ethernet. IBM is supposed to be in HP's
camp, too-as VG-AnyLAN will support either Token-Ring or Ethernet
style frames-but IBM's interests seem to be elsewhere. In many
respects, 100VG-AnyLAN is technically superior to Fast Ethernet.
Mechanisms are built into the specification to allow the traffic
to be prioritized. That's important if you want to support
voice or video data. The problem is that other than HP, there
are very few proponents of 100VG-AnyLAN.

AnyLAN's claim to fame is its ability to run over four pairs
of Category 3 twisted-pair wiring (plain ol' phone cable).
Thus, it requires no new wiring if you have four pairs of wire.
Unfortunately, the Fast Ethernet crowd figured out how to do
that, too, making AnyLAN a little less attractive.

With the likes of Bay Networks, Intel and 3Com behind Fast Ethernet,
you'll find quality cards and healthy competition for your
business. One good thing about Fast Ethernet is that the connector
and pin-out are the same as for Ethernet. Many manufacturers
make 10/100 cards that will automatically sense the type of
port to which they are connected. Once installed, you only
need to install the back-end hardware. The card and driver
will automatically take advantage of the higher speed when
it senses the presence of a Fast Ethernet hub.

If you've got Category 5 wiring (the more expensive data-grade
stuff) in place, 100BASE-TX is the type of Fast Ethernet you
want. If you've got lots of Category 3 cable pulled, the emerging
100BASE-TP4 standard will take advantage of it. How well TP4
will work in practice has caused some concern. From everything
we've seen, it should work fine up to 100 meters.

And The Winner Will Be



While all of the technologies included here have technical merit,
not all will take the marketplace by storm. And, while it shouldn't
be the sole criterion, reasonable market presence is important
for any technology you plan to deploy widely.

The only real lightweight in this group is HP's 100VG-AnyLAN.
It's been positioned against Fast Ethernet, which has built
up what seems to be an insurmountable momentum.

Fibre Channel will be successful, but only in certain market
niches such as distributed parallel processing and high-end
scientific computing. Its other home will be in the online
storage market, where Fibre Channel's arbitrated loop architecture
will be popular.

FDDI has a few good years left, but it will lose favor as ATM
becomes standardized, stable and cheap. Within three years,
new backbones installed on anything other than ATM will be
unlikely.

Fast Ethernet is a great desktop technology. It's only slightly
more expensive than regular Ethernet, and 10/100 cards make
it easy to deploy. While waiting for ATM to become a viable
standard, choose Fast Ethernet for desktop and for in-building
runs from wiring closet to router. It's a great value.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT

Fast Track Open Agent For NT

New. For the road to better NT management via SNMP, consider
Fast Track. This vendor's new product, Open Agent for NT, serves
as an SNMP agent for Windows NT servers and workstations, and
offers features that augment the SNMP agent from Microsoft's
NT package. Besides providing access to raw data statistics,
Open Agent for NT lets you retrieve information on hardware,
like CPU type and physical RAM, and on the network operating
system such as the NT version, revision and any installed service
packs. To evaluate IP routing and addressing dilemmas, you
can set up a remote ping so that an SNMP management station
can notify an NT server to ping an IP device. If you want to
know when users log in with the wrong password or when they
log out, Open Agent can install traps that point out these
instances, as well as filter which types of traps will be forwarded
to the management system. This product works with several SNMP
management consoles, such as HP OpenView and IBM NetView.

The Last Byte: ISDN Blues: And The Internet Beat Goes On

By:
Timothy Haight

Longtime readers of Network Computing may be familiar

with my guru, a former Silicon Valley executive turned psychic
adviser, who now lives on the San Francisco Peninsula's skyline,
with one eye watching the Valley and the other on the deep,
blue sea. I visit him now and again when it all becomes too
much, as I did last week...

When I got there, he was playing his djembe, an African goatskin
drum. Before I could say more than two words, he handed me
a beaded gourd he called a shekere and began telling me how
to shake it.

"Start with a simple downward stroke on the downbeat pulse,"
he said. "Hold it gently with your upper hand around the neck,
and use the fingers on your lower hand to move it up and down.
Like this"

"But I came here to talk!" I said.

"You need this more," he said. "Now. And-one, and-two, and-three.
Get it?"

I more or less got it, and he went back to playing his drum.
After a few minutes I said, "ISDN is still driving me nuts."

"ISDN drives you nuts every year. Don't break your rhythm. Loosen
up your shoulders. Relax your upper arms. Don't forget to breathe."

"But it isn't ISDN really. It's the Internet. I got this ISDN
line so I could surf the Internet faster, but all the servers
I want to go to are so jammed up that the throughput is no
faster than with my old modem."

"Don't stop playing," he said. "I need that 4/4 pulse, so I
can do the 3/4 and we can get 6/8. Oh, yes. Why don't you go
to other servers?"

"I don't want to go to other servers! The popular sites are
jammed because that's where people want to go!"

"Now look what that did to your muscle tension. Let those shoulders
go! Listen to the beat. I wish we had someone here to play
the bell. Try accessing the servers after midnight."

"I know all the tricks," I said. "I guess what really bugs me
is I feel so helpless. I'm used to this kind of stuff on my
LAN. Sometimes you're CPU-bound. Sometimes it's bandwidth.
Or disk. So you open up the bottleneck. But on the Internet,
who do you call?"

My guru stopped playing. After a while, he said, "I don't know."
He started playing again. "The marketplace will work it out."

"I don't know if it will," I said. "Maybe as long as most people
have modems, the information providers will optimize their
servers for slow access. They can blame the slow speeds on
the modems, and most people won't know the difference."

"Well, maybe those things are what happens when a medium gets
a mass audience."

"Well, maybe it sucks!"

"Will you keep playing! The thing is to keep in sync with it,
not to fight it. The Internet is evolving. Maybe next week
it'll be different."

"Maybe it'll be worse!"

"OK, write a column about it. Maybe that will make you feel
better. In the meantime, could you try this pattern? One-and
two, one-and-two, one-and-two. Push down, lift with the fingers,
down hard, then skip a beat. And don't hold that shekere so
tight, OK?"

AlPHASERVER 2100 SYSTEM AND MICROSOFT SQL
SERVER SHATTER TPC-C PRICE/PERFORMANCE RECORD

Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Corporation has
unveiled audited transaction benchmark results that establish
new records in the highly competitive market for database,
application and PC LAN servers. The results further
demonstrate the companies' leadership in providing customers
the industry's most powerful, most cost-effective open server
platforms.

Breakthrough results of 3194.4 transactions per minute (tpmC)
at $196/tpmC, based on the TPC-C(2) benchmark Revision 3.0,
were achieved on the AlphaServer 2100 5/300 64-bit SMP system
running Microsoft Windows NT Server operating system V3.51 and
Microsoft SQL Server V6.5 client/server database management
system. No other Microsoft SQL Server platform from any system
vendor delivers such impressive results.

The 3194.4 at $196/tpmC result is the industry's best price/
performance using any system, any database, or any operating
system. In fact, no other system has ever come close to
breaking the less-than-$200/tpmC barrier.

With a total system cost of $626,102, the AlphaServer 2100
5/300 delivers transaction performance and price/performance
superior to any other system priced below $1 million -- 24%
better throughput performance and $46/tpmC less than its
closest competitor, the Intel-based Compaq ProLiant 5/133

Model 2. It also provides better performance and price/
performance than many systems costing much more than $1
million (see charts below).

The Digital/Microsoft combination even outperforms a Tandem
Himalaya K10000-16 system with 16 processors and costing $3.5
million. And compared with competitive systems from IBM, HP,
Sun, Bull, AT&T, and others, these results are far superior.

"These independent benchmark results again demonstrate the
breakthrough performance and affordability of the Alpha
architecture," said Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of
the Alpha Server Business Segment. "For customers, this
represents the industry's best value in high-performance
server capabilities. It also further demonstrates the
engineering achievements of our strategic alliance with
Microsoft."

The TPC-C benchmark is the industry-standard test for
measuring database transaction processing performance and
price/performance. The $/tpmC result reflects the cost of
acquisition and ownership of the system over a five-year
period, including hardware and software maintenance, software
upgrades, and extended warranties.

"Today's news is one more way Digital and Microsoft are
bringing to customers computing solutions that offer
unprecedented value and flexibility," said Rich Tong, general
manager of the Business Systems Division at Microsoft.

"These TPC results demonstrate the power of the Microsoft SQL
Server and Digital Alpha platform for transaction- and
compute-intensive business applications in heterogeneous
environments."

Heterogeneous Computing Environment

The AlphaServer 2100 5/300 benchmark was conducted using three
CPUs and 2 gigabytes of memory. These results were achieved
in a heterogeneous computing environment, using Visigenics
ODBC client software for SCO UNIX running on Digital's
Intel-based Prioris PC systems.

"No longer must customers limit themselves to a single
operating system to get interoperability, performance, and
affordability," said Nist. "With these results, Digital has
proved that one of the best ways to solve business problems
can include a heterogeneous environment. Digital demonstrates
that a customer can leverage the strengths of both Windows NT
and UNIX to provide a cost-effective high-performance
solution." Competitive Comparisons

Customers Deploying Enterprise Database Solutions

The Potomac Group, of Nashville, Tenn., provides doctors and
hospitals in 20 states instant on-line access to Medicaid
subscriber data. According to Bill McClary, executive vice
president of operations, "Our AlphaServer 2100 / Microsoft SQL
Server solution enables us to compete and win in a market
dominated by giant companies with multi-million dollar legacy
systems."

At Ruben H. Donnelley Corporation, the world's oldest
publisher of Yellow Pages, AlphaServer 2100 systems and
Microsoft SQL Server are greatly expanding the company's
Interactive Yellow Pages, with new features such as
FAX-on-demand and sophisticated database manipulation.

And at the Los Angeles Times, the third largest newspaper in
the country, AlphaServer 2100 systems and Microsoft SQL
Server, together with Autologic for Windows NT, are powering a
rastor image processing (RIP) systems that enables the Times
to product more pages faster, with more graphics and higher
resolution, at lower cost.

300MHz Processor Upgrade, Special Pricing

In announcing the benchmark results, Digital also unveiled a
processor upgrade program for the AlphaServer 2100 and 2000
systems, raising the performance of the Alpha 21164 CPU used
in this system to a blazing 300MHz. The Alpha 21164
microprocessor is still the industry's fastest and only BIPS
(billion instructions per second) chip.

Through December, this upgrade is specially priced at only
$4,000. Complete 300MHz AlphaServer 2100 systems will be
generally available in Q1 of CY1996.

60-Day Payment-Free Leasing Offer

Digital also announced a limited-time leasing offer on all
Alpha servers and workstations. Through June 1996, Digital
Financial Services, a division of GE Capital, is offering
customers who migrate to Digital from competitors' systems a
60-day payment holiday on all 36-month leases. The program is
available to all direct and partner channels worldwide.

The Digital/Microsoft Alliance

Digital's AlphaServer systems provide a highly scalable
enterprise platform for the Microsoft BackOffice suite, which
includes Microsoft Windows NT operating system, Microsoft SQL
Server, Microsoft Systems Management Server, Microsoft SNA
Server, and Microsoft Mail Server. In June, Digital announced
an OEM agreement with Microsoft to bundle the Microsoft
BackOffice server suite with Digital AlphaServers and
Intel-based Prioris servers.

In August, Digital and Microsoft announced a major alliance,
the Microsoft-Digital Alliance for Enterprise Computing,
which will help customers implement and support Windows-based
computing in the enterprise. The enterprise level performance
numbers announced today demonstrate the results of the joint
efforts of Digital and Microsoft to deliver Windows NT-based
solutions to the enterprise.

DIGITAL UNVEILS INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR AD
INSERTION AND NEAR VIDEO-ON-DEMAND APPLICATIONS

New Products Generate Immediate Revenues For Cable Companies
and Telcos, Provide Strong Pathway To Digital Future

In a move that brings the interactive TV future into closer
reach, Digital Equipment Corporation has announced four new
interactive video servers supported by the company's powerful
Mediaplex video server architecture. The new offerings,
comprised of the Mediaplex 24-channel and 40-channel ad
insertion systems, and the Mediaplex 12-channel and 24-channel
near video-on-demand (NVOD) systems, leap frog industry
competitors to provide the fullest range of digital video
server solutions currently available.

"This announcement reaffirms that interactive television is
viable and being implemented today," said Peter Ryus,
director of worldwide marketing, Digital's Video and
Interactive Information Services. "Using existing analog
wiring infrastructures, Digital's Mediaplex servers enable
cable companies and telcos to immediately capture higher
revenues by inserting locally customized ads on cable channels
or giving viewers more selections of pay-per-view programming
and expanded schedule options.

By coupling Digital's heritage in systems integration and
networking with Mediaplex video server solutions, we are
paving the way for cable companies and telco customers to
enter a promising digital future, while providing tangible
benefits now."

Mediaplex Video Advertising Systems

The Mediaplex ad insertion systems position Digital as a
leader in providing digital ad insertion solutions for small
to large cable installations. Recently, Adlink, the regional
cable advertising interconnect tying the largest number of
cable systems in the United States, installed Digital's
systems in all 57 headends in their southern California
service area.

The 24-channel and 40-channel Mediaplex ad insertion systems
digitally encode advertisements using MPEG-2 compression
technology, then store and distribute ads over cable
communications networks to a pre-selected audience. Both
systems provide the ability to encode and distribute a 30-and
60-second spot to a cable operator's network in one hour or
less.

The Mediaplex ad insertion systems cut the costs of ad
insertion, thus improving the efficiency of advertising
scheduling, insertion and billing operations. They also
increase the inventory availability for advertising on cable
channels; enable the distribution of time-sensitive ads and
guarantee high video quality through adherence to the
International Standards Organization's (ISO) MPEG-2 standard
for full-resolution video and audio encoding.


Other Mediaplex video advertising system features include:

o local storage of 300 or more 30-second encoded ad spots;

o the StorageWorks highly available subsystem, providing ease
of maintenance with hot swap disk drives supporting RAID Level
5;

o the ability to continue inserting spots in the event of a
disk failure;

o separate hot-swap digital-to-analog decoders for each
channel, for the highest level of scheduling reliability and
ease of maintenance;

o automatic verification of completed spots from the ad
insertion system for customer billing.


These systems, which will begin shipping in volume in February
1996, are priced as low as $8,000 per channel.

Mediaplex Near Video-On-Demand

The Mediaplex NVOD systems give cable companies and telcos the
ability to broadcast multiple movies and other pay-per-view
programs according to any schedule over existing analog
infrastructures. They also provide the flexibility to program
closely staggercasted distribution of one movie, a wider range
of movies with more delay between streams, or any combination
of the two.

An optional encoding station is available so that service
providers can digitize their own content. Once digitized,
movie content is a computer file that can be routed to local
and remote video servers using traditional data networking.

By installing the Mediaplex NVOD system, customers avoid the
limitations and costs of analog-based pay per view systems,
and can begin establishing a digital infrastructure that
scales to support full interactive services, such as full
video-on-demand.

The Mediaplex NVOD system is available in two configurations:

o An Alpha-based server, priced below $180,000, provides up to
12 video streams at 8 Mbps with the capacity to store up to 18
hours of encoded content, also at 8 Mbps. A smaller system,
providing up to 6 video streams, is available for less than
$150,000. These systems are available immediately.

o A second AlphaStation system, priced at $200,000, provides
up to 24 channels of output with the capacity to store up to
18 hours of content. This system will be available in the
second quarter of 1996.


The Mediaplex Platform

Both the Digital Mediaplex NVOD and ad insertion systems are
based on Digital's industry-leading Mediaplex technology
platform. The applications are similar because they share the
tasks of scheduling and inserting content into analog
channels, and do not require a digital network from the
headend to the home.

Digital is currently the market leader in interactive
information technology, supplying media server solutions for
more trials and deployments than any other vendor. Cable
television companies using Digital's Mediaplex server
architecture include Svenska Kabel-TV in Sweden; Westminster
Cable in London; and Adlink, one of the largest advertising
interconnect services in the United States. Trials by
telecommunications companies using Digital technology include
US West's trial in Nebraska, Belgacom in Belgium, and NYNEX
and Ameritech in the Northeast and Midwest of the United
States. Digital's servers are also being used to deliver
pay-TV and near video-on-demand services by TMN Networks in
Canada.

January 1996

CABLE INDUSTRY NETWORK COMPETENCY CENTER CREATED

With the announcement of the Cable Industry Network Competency
Center, Digital Equipment Corporation has positioned itself to
become a driving force in the high-speed data communications
network industry. The Cable Industry Center offers network
consulting, integration, and management services to cable and
telecommunications companies around the world that are adding
high-speed data communications and Internet access to their
existing hybrid fiber/coax networks.

The Cable Industry Center, located in Littleton,
Massachusetts, is a logical outgrowth of the unique technical
and market experience Digital has gained over the past three
years. During that time, 60 high-speed data networks for cable
operators worldwide were installed to provide services to
local governments, schools and colleges, manufacturers,
healthcare institutions and telecommuters.

"We found that customers require both products and multivendor
integration services," said Larry Walker, vice president and
general manager of the Network Product Business Unit,
"therefore we have moved the Cable Industry Center from the
Network Product Business Unit to Digital's Network Services
group where its vast resources can be leveraged."

Graeme Shorter, vice president, Digital Network Services said:
"with this team of individuals we now have the experience,
skills, and knowledge to play a critical role as a partner in
the design, development, and deployment of complex, high-speed
data communications networks in the cable industry. This
market focus is an ideal complement to our existing network
business."

These networks provide users with high-speed access to the
"Information Superhighway," including Internet and on-line
services, as well as the ability to work at home, using
network connections that are 1,000 times faster than
conventional telephone modems.

In one of the initial projects for the Center, Digital
Equipment Corporation, MCI and Colorado Springs Cablevision
collaborated on a successful trial of the nation's first large
scale advanced telecommuting pilot during this past summer.
The Cable Industry Center is also currently working with
several other industry leading cable companies on their plans
to deploy new services.

Center Meets Urgent Need for Timely Network Implementation

Digital has created the Center at a crucial time in the
development of the high-speed data communications market. Many
service providers are now ready to move from the trial phase
to investment in full-scale full-service networks.

At the same time, changes in the regulatory environment are
opening up competition between telecommunications and cable
companies. Through the efforts of the IEEE 802.14 Committee,
the standardization and interoperability of technology for
multiple services over hybrid fiber/coax is fast approaching,
which will meet the needs of the cable industry.

"Multiple Systems Operators feel a great sense of urgency to
deploy networks," said Art Zins, managing director of the
Cable Industry Network Competency Center. "However, they worry
about making short-sighted decisions now that will preclude
other choices later. Our technical and business services can
help our customers implement flexible, modular, and economical
networks that meet their strategic business needs now and in
the future."

Leveraging Network Services and Multivendor Capabilities

The Cable Industry Network Competency Center staff bring with
them the skill and knowledge that was gained through
introducing and deploying Digital's ChannelWorks products
enabling high-speed data transmission over the existing cable
infrastructure.

As part of Network Services, the Cable Industry Center can
meet its customers' needs with cable data solutions that
employ products from multiple vendors. The Cable Industry
Center is establishing alliances with targeted cable modem
manufacturers and will continue to partner with cable
operators and systems integrators, as appropriate, to provide
the best-in-class solution. In addition, the Cable Industry
Center will be able to leverage the expertise of Network
Services' 1,300 network professionals and 40 Network Centers.
Network Services is part of Digital's Multivendor Customer
Services Division.

MoSys To Ship Multibank DRAM 01/03/96

MoSys To Ship Multibank DRAM 01/03/96
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- MoSys Inc. is set to
begin shipment of its Multibank dynamic random access memory (MDRAM)
product. The MDRAM is an extended-performance synchronous DRAM with
high bandwidth, short access times, and, according to the company,
"unique pricing."

Speaking to Newsbytes, Gary Banta, vice president of marketing for
MoSys, said: "The MDRAM is the highest performance DRAM architecture
available on the market today. Its peak bandwidth exceeds the nearest
competitive product by nearly one-third."

He continued: "First, we achieve access times on 20 nanoseconds (ns)
compared to all other DRAMs between 70 and 100 nanoseconds. Second we
not only start and stop faster, our top speed is faster, operating at
over 600 kilobytes per second. SDRAM (synchronous DRAM), for example,
operates at around 200 kilobytes per second."

MoSys claims that it employs an independent multibank organization
that is unique from any other DRAM product. This organization allows
independent operations to access different banks independently.
Because of the independent multibank system, it is no longer necessary
to use memory in predefined one megabyte (MB), 2MB, or 4MB increments,
according to the company.

Starting from 0.5MB, the MDRAM is available in 0.25MB increments. For
example, this allows 1,024 by 768 "True Color" applications, which require
2.25MB for frame buffer, to be implemented with exactly the correct amount
of memory, says the company.

Banta claims that the cost savings to the end-user is significant, saying:
"Before, if you needed a 2.25MB DRAM, you had to buy up to a 4MB product.
Buying a 2.25MB MDRAM saves the cost of the excess 1.75MB."

"While DRAM process technology affords a lot of opportunity to excel,
traditional DRAM market leaders have been reluctant to innovate in
other than standard DRAMs," said Dr. Yong Yao, senior analyst at
MicroDesign Resources. "However, standard DRAMs are bottlenecks for
many emerging applications, such as multimedia and others requiring
ultra-high performance PC graphics. Thus, market dominance by the
conventional 'dinosaurs' in DRAM technology is going to be challenged
and there clearly is an opportunity for a company like MoSys, with its
MDRAM, to be a significant player in the high-performance memory arena."

Ralph O. Cognac, vice president of business development for MoSys,
said: "This marks an important milestone in the company. With our
manufacturing partnerships in place and demand growing rapidly
after our award-winning demonstrations at Comdex, we are now
prepared to become a major player in the specialty DRAM market."

Cognac also commented that, while MoSys has received MDRAM inquiries
from a wide variety of companies from diverse application areas -- such
as high-definition television, set-top box converters, hyper-reality
games, and networking -- the closest-to-production applications
continue to be those in the PC graphics arena.

The MDRAM initially will be available in five configurations, at both
100 megahertz (MHz) and 125MHz clock speeds, with capacities that range
from 0.5MB to 1.25MB. The product is available in both 68-pin plastic
leadless chip carriers (PLCC), and 128-pin 14 by 20 by 2.7 millimeter
(mm) plastic quad flat pack (PQFP). Available immediately is the 1MB
MDRAM in 10 thousand units at $40 each, and the 1.125MB MDRAM in 10
thousand units at $45 each. Others will be available in the first
quarter, 1996.

Ericsson Secures Further Mobitex Order In Singapore 01/03/96

Ericsson Secures Further Mobitex Order In Singapore 01/03/96
STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Ericsson has secured another
major order for its Mobitex radio packet data network (PDN) in
Singapore. This time the company has contracted with the TIBS taxi
fleet, which covers the colony with 800 vehicles, to install a Mobitex
system for use by drivers, customers, and staff of the company.

According to Ericsson, using the system, customers can dial the taxi
company and, following audiotex menus, can press buttons on their
phones to order their cab.

The task is not as complex as it sounds, as TIBS has set up accounts
for its regular users, who are then offered a choice of their five
most regular pickup points. Users key in their account number and
personal identification number (PIN) to get this menu, and then receive
a confirmation of the order, together with an estimated time of arrival.
If they stay on the line, they are told which taxi driver will be
meeting with them, and, if the order if an immediate one, where that
driver is currently, together with an estimated wait time.

Ericsson claims that the Mobitex system being installed for TIBS will
allow the company to handle up to 1,000 bookings an hour, compared
with a manual system that could handle a maximum of 120 bookings an
hour previously.

The contract means that there are now 16 public Mobitex networks
operating in 15 countries. Although the radio PDN service is designed
for many different applications, Ericsson claims that the technology
is rapidly gaining a foothold in the transportation business, as well
as in field service and public safety organizations.

Motorola Claims Chinese Handwriting Breakthrough 01/03/96

Motorola Claims Chinese Handwriting Breakthrough 01/03/96
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Motorola's Lexicus Division has
unveiled a Windows 95 handwriting recognition package for the Chinese
alphabet. According to officials with Lexicus, using the package,
writers will now be able to accurately input the 13,000 Chinese
characters into Windows 95 applications on standard desktop or
notebook computers.

Known as the Lexicus Recognizer, the software is claimed to be a
"highly effective solution" with over 95 percent accuracy ratios
in "real usage situations."

The package, which will ship in the first quarter of 1996 at a price
to be announced, comes with two dictionaries containing the whole
Chinese character set (over 13,000 characters), and can be run on an
80486-based PC or better.

According to Motorola, the large number of Chinese characters is very
difficult to recognize for most users, and additional variances in
personal writing makes the procedure more complicated. Lexicus,
claims the company, can "easily cope" with these differences, making out
"cursive" style characters and so being able to handle faster and "more
natural" handwriting.

Motorola officials explained to Newsbytes that there is an additional
problem -- European keyboards are different for those designed for
use in China and other Asian countries. Lexicus can cope with even the
most basic of European keyboards, it is claimed.

According to Elton Sherwin, vice president of marketing with Lexicus,
"This technology will revolutionize the use of PCs and microprocessors
in Asia. Users no longer need to learn the English keyboard to enter
Chinese characters into PCs, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and
notebook computers. By the turn of the century this technology may run
on the surface of a watch crystal," he claimed.

Newsbytes notes that there are more than a billion writers of the
Chinese alphabet in the world. They uses one of two character sets --
traditional or simplified. The Traditional character set is in use in
Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Simplified, meanwhile, was developed in the Peoples Republic of China
and combines traditional characters with some simplified versions of
characters. Japanese Kanji letters have a considerable overlap with
traditional and, to a lesser extent, simplified Chinese characters.

Lexicus was acquired by Motorola in the fourth quarter of 1993, from
its founders, a private development company. At the time, industry
experts noted that handwriting recognition had had only a limited
technological and market success, but was seen as a key to the
potentially lucrative market for hand-held devices. Lexicus was
acquired and added to Motorola's Paging and Wireless Data Division.

Asia Newsbriefs 01/03/96

Asia Newsbriefs 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- In this roundup of news from across
Asia: Korea - Foreigners to invest in telecom companies; Indonesia -
Mitsui to launch pager service; Singapore - Telecom violations down;
India, Malaysia - Casio expands Asian production.

Korea - Foreigners To Invest In Telecom Companies

The Korean government has said foreigners or foreign companies will be
able to hold equity stakes of up to 33% in Korean telecommunication
companies from 1998. At the same time, restrictions will be lifted on
the number of foreign board members at companies, presently pegged at
one third, and the way will also be cleared for foreigners to manage
telecommunications projects. Further afield, in 2001, the government
will allow foreigners to operate telecommunications services in Korea
by leasing lines and capacity from Korean operators. Restrictions will
continue that ban foreigners from becoming majority stakeholders in
telecommunications projects.

Indonesia - Mitsui To Launch Pager Service

Japan's Mitsui & Co. Ltd. trading house will launch a pager service in
Indonesia this year. The company will jointly establish P.T. Buana
Bintangbayu with Jakata-based telecommunications company P.T.
Telekomindo Primabhakti. From the middle of January the service will
be made available in Jakata and slowly expand to other major cities in
the country. Mitsui & Co. will hold 25% of the company which will send
its signals via the Indosat satellite.

Singapore - Telecom Violations Down

Singapore's Business Times newspaper has reported the number of
violations of the telecoms laws fell in the April to September period
last year. Singapore Telecom found 19 infringements in the course of
1,327 inspections carried out during the period. In the previous six
months it conducted 1,057 inspections and discovered 52 violations.
The infringements range from selling equipment without a dealer's
license to selling equipment for local use without the correct
approval labels. Of the 19 regulation breakers, sixteen were
prosecuted, reported the newspaper.

India, Malaysia - Casio Expands Asian Production

Japan's Casio Computer is to begin manufacturing and selling pagers in
India from February. The company will establish Casio Bharti Mobile
Communications Ltd. and hold 51% of the stock, with India's Bharti
Telecom holding 40%, and Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
holding the remaining 9%. Reports put first year sales targets at
26,000, but eventual manufacturing is hoped to reach 600,000 pagers
annually. The announcement came a few days after Casio said it would
begin manufacture of digital cameras in Malaysia. Production will
begin in April with full production of 70,000 units a month of the
QV-10 digital camera due on stream in the summer.

Japan Newsbriefs 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- In this roundup of news from Japan:
Hashimoto ponders for NTT, KDD merger; NTT DoCoMo profits to surge;
Star TV plans Japanese channel; Short holidays at chip makers; Sanyo
shifting production; Ziff purchase to be partly funded by bonds issue;
Sony to enter video CD software market.

Hashimoto Ponders For NTT, KDD Merger

Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has proposed the idea of a
merger between Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT) and Kokusai Denshin
Denwa (KDD). NTT is the world's largest telephone company and
dominates the domestic telephone market in Japan, while KDD holds a
similar dominant position in the international telephone market.
Hashimoto, who is also president of the Liberal Democratic Party,
was speaking on a TV Asahi talk program. He called for further
deregulation of the Japanese telecommunications market and the joining
together of the two companies to maintain a strong position in the
face of competition from overseas telephone companies.

NTT DoCoMo Profits To Surge

Profits at the nine companies of the NTT DoCoMo network are set to
surge 36% in fiscal year 1995 to 1.1 trillion yen ($11 billion),
companies officials have said. In the eight months to September, 1995,
the companies attracted 1.48 million new subscribers, underlining the
strong growth in the sector that is leading to the profits jump.

Star TV Plans Japanese Channel

Hong Kong-based Star TV, Asia's top satellite television network, will
start a new channel for the Japanese market, according to sources
quoted by the Kyodo news service. Star TV, owned by media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch, gained permission from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications to beam programs to Japan in early 1995. The new
channel will be offered via cable and in some hotels, but not initially
via direct-to-home satellite reception. The reports suggested the
channel will begin broadcasting in April this year. Other broadcasters
planning to enter the Japanese market include Turner's TNT & Cartoon
Network and CNBC Asia. CNN International and BBC World are already
available on Japanese cable, as is a local version of MTV.

Short Holidays At Chip Makers

Workers at Japan's semiconductor manufacturers could only enjoy short
holidays this new year because of the strong demand for products.
Units of NEC Corporation reported holidays of just three days from
January 1. Other manufacturers have also cut holidays from an originally
planned six or seven days to just three. In the summer, the same
companies also cut holidays to cope with the strong demand for
computer chips.

Sanyo Shifting Production

Consumers buying Sanyo video cassette recorders will soon be unable to
find any carrying the "made in Japan" impression, according to a report
in the Yomiuri Shimbun. The newspaper said the company is looking to
move all VCR production to plants overseas to better insure against
losses due to the strong yen. Of the 3.3 million machines Sanyo makes
each year, 600,000 are produced at a plant in Osaka. The remainder are
turned out from factories in Indonesia, China, and Germany.

Ziff Purchase To Be Partly Funded By Bonds Issue

Softbank Corporation announced just after Christmas that it intends to
fund its purchase of Ziff Davis Publishing through the issue of 70
billion yen ($700 million) worth of bonds. The company agreed to
purchase Ziff Davis Publishing for $1.8 billion and has already issued
new stock and raised around 63 billion yen ($630 million).

Sony To Enter Video CD Software Market

Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc. will begin producing software
for the Video CD format in March. The company announced it will
release ten titles, including Stand By Me, Easy Rider, Taxi Driver,
The Adams Family, Kramer vs Kramer, Ghostbusters, Last Action Hero,
No Way Out, Silence of the Lambs, and Robocop. The Video CD format is
based on the CD platform and supports MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts
Group type 1) video compression. It is already widely used in Karaoke
machines and several manufacturers offer combined VHS/Video CD player
machines in Japan.

 ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight 01/03/96

 ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The decision by Compuserve to remove
20 Usenet newsgroups after complaints from German legislators is
not the first time cross-border decency and obscenity has reared its
head in Europe. The British government has already experienced the
problems universal access can cause in the satellite television sector
and other nations have been angered by cross-border broadcasting.

From the late 1980s, widespread access to broadcasts from other
European countries has become more common as small, cheap satellite
dishes have appeared on millions of European rooftops to pull in, not
just more local programming, but transmissions from other countries.

In the UK, the most well-known example of such problems involved Red
Hot Television, a late night hard core porn channel that was based in
Denmark and broadcasting to viewers across Europe.

Such programming was well in excess of British decency standards but,
the channel argued, it was legally broadcasting to the UK because the
material was within the laws of its country of origin, Denmark. Under
the European Community's "Television Without Frontiers" directive,
broadcasts were deemed acceptable community wide if they met the
requirements of the state from which they emanated from.

After much study of the laws, and consultation with the European
Community, the British government decided a clause in the directive,
allowing broadcasts to be proscribed if they threatened to corrupt the
moral values of the country, applied, and the channel was successfully
banned from the UK market. Steep fines and possible jail awaited
anyone caught selling subscriptions.

Other countries have also faced problems caused by cross-border
broadcasting. In 1989, the Dutch authorities told cable networks they
could not carry TV10, a Dutch language channel based in Luxembourg.
The channel located there because of problems obtaining a commercial
broadcasting license in the Netherlands. TV10 never launched after it
was banned from its intended audience and later appealed to the
European Court, only to be ruled against.

Last year, neighboring Belgium attempted to ban a Scandinavian-based
Flemish language channel, VT4. The station located outside of Belgium
because the country would only allow one commercial broadcaster. On
this occasion, the broadcaster won, due to the country having no
restrictions on foreign broadcasters.

The French too have also been angered by foreign channels -- this
time Ted Turner's TNT & Cartoon Network which broadcasts from London.
France said there was not enough French language content to comply
with French cultural laws and threatened to pull the channel from
cable networks nationwide. Turner added French audio channels and
subtitles and the situation was resolved.

Back in the UK, sex is again in the news as the country recently
blocked access to TV Erotica. However, pornography has not been
the only thing to upset the British. Several years ago, cable
operators were cautioned over Galavision, a Mexican TV broadcaster,
because of its screening of bull fighting.

Ironically, British-based broadcasters have also caused problems
overseas. TV3 is a network of three channels broadcasting to Sweden,
Denmark, and Norway, and established itself in London to escape strict
Scandinavian commercial laws.

The laws ban advertising for all alcoholic drinks and products,
something which the UK allows. Despite requests from the Scandinavian
authorities, the UK government cited the cross-border broadcasting laws
and TV3's legality under UK laws as the reason for its refusal to take
action.

European media chiefs and the European Union are currently in
consultation over a more comprehensive and accepted replacement to the
"Television Without Frontiers" directive. Such a directive is likely
to be closely followed by online regulators seeking to ensure common,
unrestricted access to information and services across the entire
European Union, one of the major cornerstones of the union.

Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed 01/03/96

Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed 01/03/96
LOUISVILLE, COLORADO., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- A judge has
dismissed the last two charges in a lawsuit that charged that Storage
Technology Corp. (NYSE: STK) had breached a 1990 agreement with
Stuff Technology Partners, a former development partner. Stuff had
sought $2.4 billion in its original suit.

The suit was originally filed in early 1994. Judge Morris Sandstead
Jr. dismissed 14 of the original 16 claims in June, 1995, ruling that
the General Mutual Release agreement signed by the two companies was
unambiguous. The release settled a dispute over rights to an optical
technology developed jointly by Storagetek and Stuff. Storagetek said
the two companies put about $68 million into the project, but no
product was ever brought to market.

The final two claims were based on a Stuff allegation that
Storagetek had breached the original 1990 agreement by developing
and/or manufacturing optical disk products and/or media. Storagetek
said the 1990 agreement allows both parties to use the technology --
Stuff in optical products and Storagetek in any non-optical application.

However, according to Storagetek spokesperson David Reid, that doesn't
matter because none of Storagetek's products use Stuff's technology.
Storagetek said affidavits signed by numerous Storagetek senior managers
and engineers prove that no such products have been developed or
manufactured since the release was signed.

At the time Stuff filed its suit, Storagetek spokesperson Judith
Hargrave, in an interview with Newsbytes, called the suit "frivolous."
Hargrave said the partnership raised about $40 million. The funds were
to be paid out to Storagetek as the technology was developed.

Storagetek said it is considering filing a claim to recover damages
on the grounds that the suit filed by Stuff was a violation of the
terms of the 1990 agreement between the two organizations.

New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider 01/03/96

New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider 01/03/96
WALSALL, WEST MIDLANDS, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Open Integration, a well-
known computer systems supplier, has set up a subsidiary operation to
offer Internet services. Known as Cyberphile, the Internet service
provider (SP) claims that, thanks to its parentage and a UKP500,000
investment in a fiber optic network spanning the UK, it can offer
"third-generation" Internet facilities to its customers.

Susan Perry, a spokesperson for the company, told Newsbytes that the
reference to the third generation is because the company is adopting a
"serious approach" to its provision of Internet services, offering
subscriptions ranging from simple dial-up monthly packages through to
leased line circuits with attendant consultancy and services such as
World Wide Web hosting.

"Because of our links with Open Integration, although we are a
separate company, we can provide businesses who need hardware support
a variety of options, including the leasing or rental of computer
hardware to run their Internet systems on," she claimed.

Cyberphile's headquarters is located in Walsall, in the West Midlands,
with the company claiming to have a 256,000 bits-per-second (bps) link
directly into the Internet backbone in the US. The company has
contracted with Energis, the National Power telecoms company, for
access to its virtual Points of Presence (vPOP) network across the UK,
which currently has around 80 percent local call access.

Because the Energis network is "virtual," all modem calls terminate at
Cyberphile's offices, where a bank of 28,800 bps Multitech modems link
into a series of Digital 64-bit Alpha servers that feed into the US
Internet backbone.

According to Perry, although there are now more than 80 Internet
service providers (SPs) operating in the UK, Cyberphile reckons there
is room in the market for another one, especially since only four other
Internet SPs have national local call coverage.

Sign-up to the Cyberphile service costs UKP19.99, with a monthly
subscription charge of UKP12.99. In return, subscribers get a fully
registered copy of Netscape, plus a suite of Internet applications
software for Windows. Plans are in hand to offer an Apple Macintosh
computer package for Mac subscribers, Perry told Newsbytes.

In addition to the basic service, the company is offering the Cybernet
toolbox Internet package, along with Cybersolve, an interactive
helpdesk utility. According to the company, Cybernet supports a fully
automated installation and configuration of the user's software,
allowing subscribers to be up and running in "a matter of minutes."

Cybersolve, meanwhile, is an interactive helpdesk application that
the company claims can be used either between Cyberphile and the
subscriber, or between a customer's in-house support team and the
members of staff on the Net. The package is billed as being "invaluable"
in an academic environment where many students are using the Internet,
and in large companies where all staff use e-mail and other Internet
facilities. In use, Cybersolve is billed as enabling the helpdesk to
take over the user's PC in order to solve problems remotely.

On the corporate front, Cyberphile claims to offers two services to
corporate subscribers which include the rental of Digital 75 megahertz
(MHz) Pentium PCs, 28,800bps BABT-approved modems, and Windows 95
preloaded. The advanced option includes 16 megabytes (MB) of memory
in place of the standard 8MB, along with Web page authoring and
Cybersolve software.

To encourage new subscribers to the fledgling service, Cyberphile is
offering half-price starter packs and the first month's subscription
free of charge. According to Mike Hurney, Cyberphile's managing
director, the Internet SP is among the top four SPs from day one of
its operation in terms of coverage, service, and training.

"We aim to be number one with subscribers and once there we'll stay
there. We have invested more, we charge less, and subscribers are
going to be very happy with our unique level of service. Many of our
competitors still offer services based around 2,400bps modems and
render additional charges based on elapsed connection time," he said.

Hurney went on to say that he views this as very much first-generation
Internet. Cyberphile, on the other hand, he claims, "represents the
birth of the third generation."

To get new users online to the Internet, Cyberphile is offering
subscribers free seminars on most weekday evenings so that aspiring
corporate, academic, or general public "surf slaves" need simply turn
up to become tuned in.

Further details of Cyberphile can be found on the company's Web pages,
which are located at http://www.cyberphile.co.uk .

Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI 01/03/96

Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI 01/03/96
DUBLIN, IRELAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Telecom Ireland has contracted with
MCI to take a two megabits-per-second (Mbps) link from Telecom Ireland's
headquarters in Dublin to MCI's Internet backbone in the US. According
to David Hughes, a spokesperson for Telecom Ireland, the link will
mean that more than 40 percent of all Internet traffic from Ireland
travels over MCI's 45Mbps and 155Mbps backbone lines in the US.

According to Hughes, Internet service providers (SPs) to date in
Ireland have been offering relatively localized Internet SP services
concentrated on the Dublin area, with some regional points of presence
(POPs) in other Irish cities.

"These SPs have then been taking a 64,000 bits-per-second (bps) or
128,000 bps leased line (from Ireland) into the UK or France, via services
such as Pipex and France Telecom. The problem with this approach is that a
64,000 bps leased line costs around the IRP (Irish Punts) 80,000 mark,
once all the costs have been added in," he said.

"This means that those smaller Internet SPs have had to concentrate as
much traffic as possible into the limited capacity leased lines in
order to get a return on their investment that can be charged at
normal Internet rates in the Irish Republic. There have been reports
of congestion on some Internet SPs' services," he said.

"What our initiative with MCI means is that the cost of a 64,000 bps
link through ourselves into the MCI US network is around the IRP
40,000 mark a year, which is around half of the competition. Since
we're not in the market for end-user Internet services, we plan to
offer slices of the 2Mbps link to Internet SPs in Ireland," he added.

Hughes claims that Telecom Ireland's deal with MCI on the Internet
front will see a downward pressure on Internet pricing in Ireland,
once the Internet SPs take advantage of the lower commercial rates of
the MCI link. This, he said, has to be good news for the Internet user
community, who will see the cost of their services fall, along with
congestion on the Internet, from their perspective.

MCI, meanwhile, is also providing a 512 kilobits-per-second (Kbps)
connection into the internetMCI backbone for Ireland's Higher Education
Authority. This link, the US telecoms giant claims, is being used by
colleges and universities in Ireland for Internet access.

According Margaret Malloy, vice president of marketing for Telecom
Ireland's US operation, the 2Mbps and 512Kbps links are critical
to the expansion of Internet service by Telecom Ireland. Plans are in
hand to extended Telecom Ireland's current nine POPs to 26, one for
exact local calling area in Ireland, with each POP connected by a
frame relay backbone.

"Telecom Ireland now provides service to more than 75 percent of
Ireland's end-users with additional roll-out already underway," she
said. She added that Telecom Ireland will be the first provider in
Europe to offer country-wide Internet access for the cost of a local
telephone call.

According to Malloy, plans also for Telecom Ireland to provide private
line and ISDN (integrated services digital network) access to the
Internet during 1996. "These links ensure high-quality access to the
Internet both to domestic users in Ireland who are accessing the
Internet, and to World Wide Web users who access Web pages in Ireland,"
she said.

America Online Readies UK Rollout 01/03/96

America Online Readies UK Rollout 01/03/96
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The UK will get its first taste of
America Online's European service later this month when the service is
officially launched to the media, prior to a formal public launch in
March, Newsbytes has learned. Although the plans are top secret prior to
a media launch in two weeks time, Newsbytes has discovered that UK pricing
has been set at UKP3.95 per month for up to five hours of access, and
extra hours billable at UKP1.85 each.

The rates are slightly under the "Internet in a box" service launched
last month by CompuServe UK, but the AOL UK service does not surcharge
users for non-metro access, nor are any extra charges levied for
daytime usage.

AOL has seemingly spurned the Sprint International packet data network
(PDN) option that it was expected to use for European access to its
online service. Instead, the network has secretly constructed UK
extensions to its AOLNet private PDN that operates in the US and
Canada.

The UK AOLNet offers local calling service to around 85 percent of the
UK's population at 28,800 bits-per-second (bps), and plans are in hand
to cover the whole of the UK on a local calling basis by this summer.

Interestingly, the UK AOLNet does not seem publicly available to
US/Canadian subscribers of AOL, who are being steered to AOL's
GlobalNet PDN service for international access to the online service,
at a cost of $6.00 per hour, over and above normal US/Canadian AOL
access charges.

Detailed examination of the AOL GlobalNet files published on AOL over
the Christmas period shows that the service its actually the SITA
Scitor private global PDN service that CompuServe also uses for
international access in out-of-the-way places. Unlike AOL, however,
CompuServe surcharges its subscribers $12.00 per hour for Scitor PDN
access, which is aimed at users of CompuServe in Eastern Europe and
parts of the Far East and South America that are "non metro."

This strategy appears to be to ensure that new subscribers to AOL's UK
service have the best data throughput, since fast Internet access --
at 28,800 bps -- will form the basis of AOL's UK offering to PC
Windows and Apple Mac users, once the service is formally launched in
March.

Like CompuServe, AOL is hosting its "UK service" on the US computer
service, and plans are in hand to host UK-specific information
services on specific areas of AOL closer to the March launch date.

The fact that AOL is rolling out international service via the Scitor
PDN, however, under its AOL GlobalNet banner, suggests that a pan-
European rollout, and a global rollout, of the online service cannot
be far behind the UK launch this March.

Newsbytes has tested the AOL GlobalNet (Scitor) PDN access for AOL, as
well as the AOLNet UK service, over the Christmas period using the
Windows and Apple Mac 2.6 versions of AOL's software, and can report
that the GlobalNet access works, albeit only at speeds of up to 14,400
bps from non-metro locations.

The AOLNet UK service, however, operates at 28,800 bps from most
locations and works at speeds comparable with the AOLNet PDN service
in the US and Canada. At peak times, however, Internet Web access is
relatively slow, although to be fair to AOL, this criticism can also
be levied at CompuServe.

Advertisements have now started appearing in the quality press in the
UK, offering PC Windows users with modems the change to try out the
AOL UK service free of charge for two months, on an unlimited basis,
provided they have a valid credit card. Representatives of AOL that
Newsbytes spoke with at the UK toll-free hotline said that take-up of
the ads has been "excellent."

China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts 01/03/96

China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts 01/03/96
BEIJING, CHINA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The Chinese version of Windows 95 has
been put into large-scale production in Shanghai. The Chinese version
will follow the standard Chinese fonts and input methods recommended by
the Chinese Committee on Information Technology Standards (CCITS).

All the development and testing of the Simplified Chinese version of
Windows 95 has been completed and the production has started at a joint
venture with Microsoft in the Pudong New Development Area of Shanghai,
said Jia-bin Duh, general manager of the Microsoft representative office
in China.

The new software will follow the standards recommended by CCITS, which
is China's highest body for language standardization in the computer
field. In return, the Ministry of the Electronics Industry and Chinese
State Bureau of Technology Supervision agreed to endorse Chinese
Windows 95 as a "preferred product" and recommend it to domestic users.

Microsoft's list of new products to be introduced to Chinese users in
1996 will also include Microsoft Office 95, and Chinese versions of
Windows NT and Fox Pro, according to Duh.

The Chinese version of Windows 95 is expected to attract many customers
from the Chinese mainland, and the software should find huge markets
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the United States, and Canada, where
there are big Chinese communities, software experts said.

In China, Microsoft invested more than US$2 million in 1995, and its
registered sales showed a 100 percent growth in 1995. The software giant
will also set up more branches in Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1996.

China - Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom Project Founded 01/03/96
BEIJING, CHINA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- An Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom project
has recently been founded by six entities from China and Singapore with
the intention of providing mobile phone services to any place in the
Asia-Pacific region.

The project was founded by four Chinese government organizations and
two Singapore partners: China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control
General, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom Satellite Telecom Co. Ltd.,
China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp., Singapore Telecom,
and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.

With an estimated cost from US$500 million to US$800 million, the
project intends to allow mobile phone users to make calls from anywhere
in the Asia-Pacific region. The project is to start operation in 1998,
providing "seamless" phone usage from Pakistan to Japan and covering
almost half of the world's population.

The services are aimed not only at residents in rural areas, but also
at business travelers working on infrastructure projects in remote
areas without telephone facilities.

Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth 01/03/96

Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- A recent report released by the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) projects that, three years
from now, there will be ten phones for every one hundred Filipinos, and
seven million main lines throughout the Philippines. There are presently
1.9 million main lines in the country, according to the NTC report.

To meet the demand for basic telephone service, the NTC is currently
"leveling off" the telecommunications playing field so that "all service
providers may compete in an atmosphere of equal opportunity and
universal access," claims the commission. This is in accordance with
President Fidel V. Ramos' Executive Order (EO) 109, a policy to improve
the provision of local exchange service (LES).

The NTC claims that the government policy is unique in that "lucrative
telecommunications services such as the Cellular Mobile Telephone System
and the International Gateway Facility are being used to cross-subsidize
the less profitable but equally essential local exchange service."

EO 109 requires a minimum installation of 400,000 local exchange
lines for each cellular operator, and a minimum of 300, 000 local
exchange lines for each IGF operator within three years from the date
of authority to operate and maintain LES, the NTC report explains.

The NTC report also bared the "flagship" programs of the commission
for 1996, which includes the provision of "universal access" of basic
telephone services to rural areas, and the intensification of "enforcement
and monitoring activities" to clear the radio frequency spectrum to
encourage new telecommunications services and more investments in
the industry.

The NTC vision is that, after three years, applications for telephone
connections anywhere in the Philippines will be served within "ten
days and not ten years."

Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI 01/03/96

Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Printer sales in the
Asia-Pacific region do not exhibit any signs of being affected by the
move towards a "paperless office concept," or a part implementation of
it in the near future, despite the growing awareness and compliance
regarding electronic data interchange (EDI) by certain industry and
government segments in the region. This is according to International
Data Corporation (IDC), a market research and consulting firm.

In a recently published study on the Asia-Pacific printer market, IDC
forecasts a 15 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in terms
of unit shipments, and a 20 percent CAGR in terms of value shipments
of printers for the 1995 to 1999 period. In 1994, regional printer
off-takes stood at 3,630,482 units worth $2.785 billion, with the small
office/home office (SOHO) as the largest application segment, IDC said.

The Asia Pacific region, according to IDC definitions, is composed of
the large country markets of Australia and Korea, the economically
vibrant markets of Singapore and Hongkong, and the emerging markets of
the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

The market for impact printers (serial dot-matrix and line printers) is
not likely to peak in the next few years. In 1994, impact printers made
up 43 percent of the market share in units and 30 percent in value. By
1998, according to IDC projections, the impact market is estimated to
be less than 30 percent of the total printer market in unit shipments,
and around 12 to 18 percent in value. Inkjet printers are the biggest
threat to the market, particularly the 24-pin serial dot-matrix printers,
because inkjets are now priced at or below $500.

In the non-impact market (inkjet, laser, and thermal printers), inkjets
are currently growing in unit shipments at a much faster rate when
compared to laser printers. IDC predicts that inkjet prices will slip
further as this printer type continues to grow and eat into the impact
market share. By 1998, however, "inkjets are expected to plateau
and lasers will get into replacing inkjets, especially in areas where
speed is a significant factor," said IDC.

As for the future of thermal printers, IDC predicts that it will be
slow in unit shipment terms. "Thermals, to an extent, have got into a
niche market and it seems rather unlikely that they will come out of it
and proliferate into the general corporate applications in the near
future."

In a related survey on printer sales in the Philippines during the first
half of 1995, IDC marks that the local printer market posted sales of
about 48,160 units, worth $27.8 million.

The IDC study reveals that domestic printer market revenues in the
January to June period of 1995 surpassed that of the first half of 1994
by approximately 48 percent.

Of the total amount of printers sold in the country in the first half of
1995, serial dot-matrix (24-pin and nine-pin) printers accounted for
59 percent of market revenues. Laser printers made up 19 percent of
the market, while inkjet printers took up 17 percent. IDC further
notes that the share of inkjets to domestic printer market revenues in
the first half of 1995 exceeded that of the first half of 1994 by 100
percent.

The studies on printer sales in the Asia-Pacific and in the Philippine
markets were prepared by the IDC Asia-Pacific office based in Hongkong.
The IDC Philippines office is currently conducting a survey on the
demand of information technology (IT) products.

Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation 01/03/96

Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Cisco Systems Inc. has
announced the opening of its representative office in the Philippines.

According to J.T. Yeoh, managing director of Cisco's South Asia
Operations, the goal of the representative office in the Philippines is
not to replace Cisco resellers, but to further extend customer support
and to "educate the market." Yeoh also disclosed that the company is
investing US$3 million over a period of three years.

Yeoh further revealed that Cisco had a 300% revenue growth in the
country from 1994 to 1995, and that same three-digit growth is
targeted for 1996.

"That we did establish our office this year as we have earlier
announced is a test of our commitment to helping the Philippine
market grow," said Cynthia N. Torres, country manager of the
Philippine office.

The Philippine representative office, Cisco Systems' 12th in Asia
and 90th worldwide, has a staff of three. Within 1996, the office
aims to expand the staff to six.

Resellers in the Philippines which have been largely responsible
for pushing Cisco products in the market include Ayala Systems
Technology Inc., Computer Network Systems Corp., Phil-Data
Business Systems, and Fujitsu Philippines Inc.

Cisco also has three active global partners -- Alcatel, Siemens,
and Olivetti -- and maintains worldwide relationships with Hewlett-
Packard, AT&T, Unisys, and Digital Equipment.

 ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble 01/03/96

 ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble 01/03/96
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The
telecommunications reform legislation has become a political
house of cards that could collapse with the slightest ill wind.
Prospects for passage remain in doubt with Congress back in
Washington and seemingly paralyzed by the budget impasse.

The latest episode in the telecommunications drama took place
late last week, when Senate Majority Leader (and likely GOP
presidential nominee) Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said he had problems
with a "multi-billion dollar giveaway" to broadcasters contained
in the compromise legislation that has emerged from a joint
House-Senate conference committee.

The provision, sought most avidly by House Republicans, would
reserve a portion of the broadcast spectrum for free licenses
for digital television. Government officials estimate that the
licenses are worth between $11 billion and $70 billion, if they
were auctioned off, the way other new spectrum allocations have
been handled.

In a news conference, Dole singled out the spectrum allocation
as one of "three or four or five provisions" that Republicans
should re-examine in the complex legislation.

Dole's comments put Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), nominally the
Republican front man on the issue, into near panic. "If we get
into a controversy over the spectrum again," he said, "the bill
is going to die."

But Pressler has lost leadership on the issue, which has fallen
to Sen. Ernest "Fritz" Hollings (D-S.C.), ranking Democrat on
Pressler's Senate Commerce Committee and former chairman.
Hollings has used the threat of a filibuster to win changes in
the legislation sought by the Democrats.

Earlier, House Republican freshmen objected to the deal their
leaders negotiated in the conference committee, particularly
limits on media cross-ownership that was a bottom line issue for
the Democrats and the White House.

Ironically, Vice President Al Gore's bragging following the
unveiling of the compromise bill that the White House got
everything it wanted contributed to the revolt of the GOP
freshmen. "If Al Gore was crowing, that meant we got rolled," a
staffer for a Republican freshman told Newsbytes.

The 281-page text of the bill is now circulating among
lawmakers, and the leadership hopes to work out a schedule for
action this week.

"But it could all come unglued very quickly," warns a House
Democratic aide.

Federal Shutdown Web Page 01/03/96

Federal Shutdown Web Page 01/03/96
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- As Washington enters
the third week of the partial government shutdown, a local business
has created a World Wide Web site intended to help tourists find
places to visit in the Nation's Capital.

The site, called Shutdown '95, has also become a place for
disgruntled bureaucrats to vent their irritation at their
political masters. The site includes e-mail links to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kan.), and President Clinton.

It also has listings of museums and other attractions in the
Washington area that are still open to the public.

The frustrated federal employees contacting Shutdown '95 have
spread the blame around. One called Gingrich "a spy sent by
alien life forms to disrupt the lives of ordinary Americans."
Others have savaged Clinton and Dole.

The site is being maintained by Business Information Network, a
Maryland firm that specializes in creating Web pages for others,
including some government agencies.

"The idea came to me when some friends who were visiting from
Philadelphia got upset that their trip to DC had been ruined by
the shutdown," says Joanna Pineda, president of Business
Information Network. "Since they weren't from the area, they
thought the only things left to do were to go shopping or maybe
eat out."

He continued: "And then it hit me. I've been living in the DC area
since 1989 and I know dozens of fabulous places in this area that
are completely unaffected by the shutdown. These museums, galleries,
and other entertainment centers are open! We're hoping that
this home page will help disaffected tourists and residents
alike enjoy the many other attractions that DC has to offer. I
want people to have wonderful vacations here and leave DC with
great memories. This is a great city, shutdown or not!"

The opening graphic of the site is an empty House of
Representatives, which is somewhat misleading, as Congress is
still in business and has not been affected by the shutdown. The
site also includes a graphic of the White House with a red slash
through it.

The Web page says it is "your starting point for having a
wonderful time in Washington in spite of Bill, Bob, and Newt."

The Web site is located at http://www.bizinfonet.com/shutdown .

Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute 01/03/96

Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute 01/03/96
DALLAS, TEXAS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Texas Instruments Inc.
(NYSE: TXN) and Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd could be
chipping away at each other in a courtroom if the two companies
can't settle patent infringement allegations.

TI has filed a suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas that alleges patent infringement by Samsung in the
manufacture of semiconductor devices, including dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) chips. A TI spokesperson said the suit asks for
unspecified damages. Samsung has countered with a suit of its own
alleging infringement of 13 of Samsung's US patents by TI.

The suits come after the two companies were unsuccessful in
negotiating the renewal of a five-year semiconductor patent
cross-licensing agreement that expired December 31, 1995. The
negotiations went on for almost one year.

"We have been through this before," TI spokesperson Neil McGlone
told Newsbytes. He was referring to the fact that the five-year
agreement was the result of a patent infringement suit filed by TI
against Samsung in 1990. It took two years to hammer out that
agreement.

Richard Agnich, TI senior vice president and general counsel, said
the company is protecting its investment of billions of dollars in
research and development. A number of TI patent licensing
agreements were scheduled to expire at the end of 1995 or in early
1996. In addition to Samsung, those agreements include deals with
NEC, Fujitsu, and Nippon Denso. TI expects to realize an estimated
$108 million in royalties from those agreements in the fourth
quarter, which ended December 31. McGlone said Samsung accounted
for a majority of that amount.

TI expects to announce its fourth quarter and fiscal 1995 results
on January 23. While he wouldn't comment on what those results
would be, McGlone told Newsbytes, "1995 was a very good year for the
entire industry and we expect the news to be in line with that kind
of growth."

TI said it will also file a complaint with the International
Trade Commission asking that group to prevent Samsung from importing
devices that infringe TI's patents.

In addition to patent infringement allegations, Samsung also
requested the court to declare that the patents owned by TI are
not infringed by Samsung and are invalid and unenforceable.

Samsung is building a semiconductor fabrication facility in
Austin, Texas, that is expected to become operational by early
1998.

 ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups 01/03/96

 ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups 01/03/96
COLUMBUS, OHIO, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- CompuServe made international
headlines this past week when it announced it would temporarily suspend
access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups. Contacted by German
authorities, the online giant was told the delivery of "certain specified
newsgroups" carrying pornographic material constituted a violation of
German criminal law.

Across a number of Internet newsgroups, CompuServe is the object of
criticism for what some Internet users are calling "severe censorship."
The German government says the investigation into the groups is
focused on compliance with the country's laws regarding pornography.

In a formal statement, CompuServe said it was not involved with
determining the specified groups, but would temporarily suspend access
to the groups in order to adhere to an ongoing German investigation.
German authorities ordered CompuServe to do what was necessary to comply
with German laws regarding child pornography, other pornographic material
illegal for adults, and potentially illegal material for minors.

Newsbytes learned the 200+ list includes newsgroups such as:
alt.magick.sex, alt.religion.sexuality; alt.homosexual, alt.sex, and
gay-net.coming-out.

CompuServe says it is working with German officials to resolve the
matters in question and since altering the content of any of the groups
in question is not possible, the only alternative is the temporary
suspension.

Unlike its main competitors -- America Online (AOL) and Prodigy --
CompuServe has offered its online services internationally since 1979.
AOL is just now establishing a European presence through a partnership
with Bertelsmann in Germany. In a recent announcement, CompuServe said
its European subscriber base numbered in excess of 500,000 with another
200,000 in Great Britain.

Outlining the problem, Kim Scher, a spokesperson for CompuServe, told
Newsbytes, "We have received the fullest possible reaction to the
announced suspension of these newsgroups. From negative comments to
praise, responses from our members seem to cover the full gamut of
reactions. What people may not realize is that our only choice was to
suspend the groups in question. The prosecutor in Munich, Germany,
informed us our employees in Germany could face prosecution."

Scher said CompuServe does not, at this time, have the capability to
suspend the listed newsgroups only in Germany. "We have worked
intensely over the holidays to build segments which will allow us to
control the delivery of Internet content to specific countries," said
Scher. "Once we have that capability built into our online technology,
we will be able to comply with the laws of specific countries."

"Other online services and Internet providers will be watching our
response to this issue in Germany. Around the world, the Internet will
be met by different national legal systems and some of those may be
more strict than Germany," said Scher. Instead of a universal Internet,
users across the world may see a national or regional delivery of
Internet content, claim some observers.

 ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs 01/03/96

 ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs 01/03/96
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Breaking up, as the song
said, is hard to do. That's especially true if you work for AT&T (NYSE:T),
which has announced it will cut about 40,000 jobs in its telecommunications
services and systems and technology companies as these and AT&T Global
Information Solutions become independent firms.

AT&T Global Information Solutions, the company's computer operation,
had already announced plans to shed about 8,500 jobs as part of the
restructuring. AT&T said its latest announcement will not affect AT&T GIS.
The 40,000 figure does include roughly 6,500 managers who have already
taken a voluntary severance package, officials said.

In a teleconference Tuesday, Rick Miller, senior executive vice-president
and chief financial officer, said AT&T will take a charge of about $6
billion before taxes for the breakup, which the company announced in
September. Of this, Miller said, about $2.6 billion will cover the cost
of separation agreements with employees who lose their jobs. Another $1.1
billion has been allocated for closing facilities, and $1.7 billion for
asset write-offs.

After taxes, the charge is expected to reduce AT&T's fourth-quarter earnings
by about $4 billion. The company has not released projected fourth-quarter
financials yet, but given that its earnings in the first nine months of
the year were only $2.82 billion, it seems clear the special charge will
lead to a sizable loss in the quarter, and could put AT&T in the red for
the year. AT&T took a post-tax charge of $1.17 billion in the third quarter
to cover cuts in AT&T GIS and other actions.

AT&T announced in September that it would break into three units. One
company, offering telecommunications services, will keep the AT&T name.
A new systems and technology company -- theoretically freed by the breakup
to sell its wares more easily to potential competitors -- will go public
some time in the first half of this year. It has not yet been named. AT&T
GIS, which is essentially the former NCR Corp., will be the third separate
entity.

AT&T officials said some 4,000 of the jobs that will disappear are in
businesses the company plans to sell anyway, so those people will have
some hope of keeping their jobs under new ownership. Coupled with the
6,500 managerial jobs already cut through voluntary packages, this means
about 30,000 layoffs are looming. Of the 40,000 jobs cut altogether, AT&T
said, about 17,000 will be in the services business, and the other 23,000
in the systems and technology operations. If implemented today, these cuts
would leave the services business with 110,000 employees, and the systems
and technology company with 108,000. When it announced the breakup in
September, AT&T had about 303,000 employees.

About 70 percent of the job cuts will be completed by the end of 1996,
Miller said.

Miller said AT&T will be announcing further divestitures like the already-
revealed plan to sell its Paradyne unit. He also said some international
investments, including the company's stake in Canadian long-distance
carrier Unitel Communications Inc., are to be revalued. Plans also include
writing off some technology that is obsolete or no longer strategic, such
as hardware related to the Telex business and proprietary online software
whose marketability is threatened by the current move to the Internet.

Miller said plans for the breakup are moving ahead on schedule, with the
leadership of the three companies now appointed and organizational
structures designed. AT&T plans to file a prospectus for the systems and
technology company's initial public offering with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of January, he said, and the
offering is expected this quarter.

STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems 01/03/96

STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems 01/03/96
LONDON, ONTARIO, CANADA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- STD Systems Inc. has begun
shipping its Power2 workstations and servers, based on PowerPC chips, to
Canadian universities, government buyers, and smaller corporations. The
company claimed it is the first to build PowerPC systems in Canada.

The Power2 systems, additions to STD's CompuPartner product line, use
PowerPC 603, 603e, and 604 reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
processors on Motorola Corp. Atlas motherboards. They ship with
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.

Abe Ellorin, an STD account manager, told Newsbytes that his company
sells most of its products in Canada and does all its development there.
Motherboards and other components are mainly imported, he said, though
STD assembles the systems in three Canadian manufacturing plants.

Higher education is a major market for STD, Ellorin said, but the
company also sells to the federal government and is pursuing small
corporate accounts. Seven-year-old STD claims to have a 19 percent share
of the educational PC market in Canada.

Company officials said the PowerPC technology is ideally suited to
research and high-end applications where customers need powerful central
processors. STD said it hopes for "a few million dollars" in sales of
the systems in 1996, growing in future years as more PowerPC-based
software comes to market.

The PowerPC processors, used in newer Apple Computer Inc. Macintoshes,
some IBM RISC System/6000 machines and computers from several other
vendors, are the result of a joint development effort by Apple, IBM,
and Motorola.

Prices for the CompuPartner Power2 systems will range from C$4,000
upward, with top-of-the-line systems starting around C$8,000, Ellorin
said.

STD Systems has a site on the World Wide Web at http://www.std.ca .

Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption" 01/03/96

Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption" 01/03/96
CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Security
Dynamics plans to license "Concryption," a just patented
technology combining encryption and compression, to outside
companies for use with a variety of security and compression
protocols, revealed Kenneth Weiss, chairman and chief technical
officer, during an interview with Newsbytes.

"It is my belief that Concryption will solve the two biggest
problems that exist today: the need for privacy and more
available bandwidth," Weiss told Newsbytes.

"Compression has been catching on. It takes less time today to
send a whole page of fax than it used to, for example, and part
of that is because of better data compression. But encryption has
not caught on in the way it should, because of time and expense
issues and the hassles of key management."

Still, though, available bandwidth for data storage and
transmission is diminishing all the time, in arenas ranging from
fax to satellite technology, networked information, and the World
Wide Web, according to the company chairman.

Compression will become an even more significant requirement in
the future, with an anticipated explosion of multimedia applications,
he predicted.

Security Dynamics has been awarded US Patent No. 5,479,512 for
Concryption. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company now holds
a total of 14 patents from the US Patent Office, most related
to its "core business" of computer security, he reported.

One of the company's other patents, for instance, is for a
biometric technology designed to enable "voice fingerprinting."
Security Dynamics also produces the SecureID Card, ACE/Server,
and ACM series of user authentication products.

Security Dynamics' newly patented Concryption technology is based
on mathematical synergies between the processes of encrypting and
compressing data, Newsbytes was told. Both procedures call for
analyzing arrays of binary patterns, "seeing where the spaces
are," and then applying rules to the data.

Weiss added that encryption and compression are both highly
intensive in terms of CPU (central processor unit) cycles and
disk accesses. As a result, he asserted, integrating the two
technologies into a "single set of operations" will bring cost
reductions in CPU usage as well as faster encryption times.

"The time to compress might increase a little bit, but on the
other hand, the time to encrypt goes to zero. Whatever the disk
accesses are for compression, there would be no other disk
accesses for encryption."

Security Dynamics sees Concryption as a "concept pattern" suited
to use with a variety of data types, network transports, and
security protocols, according to Weiss. "This is a new enabling
technology that we believe should have an impact on the way
information is communicated in the future."

The company intends to work with outside licensees on integrating
different compression and encryption methods. "Big users have
already optimized compression for their unique technologies. We
use a different form of compression for fax than we would for
satellite data or TV pictures. Beyond that, companies might
employ different compression algorithms. Similarly, people like
to have control over the type of encryption used," Weiss
maintained.

Although forthcoming multimedia applications will require much
greater compression than text, conventional needs for "privacy"
may not be as high, since many video offerings of the future will
be geared to entertainment, Weiss acknowledged.

"But we will probably be seeing `economic privacy,'" the company
chairman noted, pointing to a trend, already well established in
the cable TV industry, toward providing "high demand" fare such
as first-run movies only on separately priced, encrypted,
"premium channels."

Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product 01/03/96

Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product 01/03/96
ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Pipeline Communications
Inc. rolled into the new year with the release of Pipeline API Toolkit
for Windows 95, an electronic customer registration product which
provides hardware and software developers with tools to enable online
registration of Windows 95 programs.

The company said the API (application programming interface) toolkit
is "the answer" to low product registration via the traditional
postcard method. The company said the traditional registration
method yields only a 10-20 percent registration. The company
claims registrations jump by as much as 80 percent for applications
using the electronic registration method. Failure to register a
software product means the user doesn't get information about
upgrades and may have difficulty getting technical support.

According to Pipeline, the electronic registration information
goes into the company's worldwide data center in Atlanta, where it
is processed and incorporated into the secure customer registration
database of the appropriate vendor. Pipeline said it can provide
electronic product registration in more than 90 countries,
using x.25 communications and global 800 service.

A company representative told Newsbytes the developer can implement one
of several standard registrations or customize the process to gather
the information the developer needs. The registration can include,
what Pipeline calls, "reminder technology" which causes a registration
reminder to periodically appear on screen that reminds the user of the
benefits of registering the software.

"Sometimes the user is excited about buying a new product, like a game,
and they don't want to take the time to register right now. They want
to do it later," said a company official.

Pipeline spokesperson Phil Hall told Newsbytes the registration
database information is provided to the developer for marketing
purposes such as sending users discount coupons for upcoming
products and performing customer surveys.

The Pipeline API toolkit for Windows 95 has a suggested retail
price of $995 and is shipping now. The new software adds to
Pipeline's family of similar products for Windows 3.1, DOS, and
Macintosh-based products. The developer does not have to pay any
royalty fees for applications using the toolkit.

Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month 01/03/96

Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month 01/03/96
SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Data Broadcasting
Corporation (NASDAQ: DBCC) has announced a new Internet financial data
service, DBC MarketWatch. It will offer real-time stock market data
over the Internet at prices now charged for delayed services.

DBC MarketWatch, which will go live on DBC's existing Internet site at
www.dbc.com beginning March 1, will be priced at $29.95 per month,
and will include real-time stock market quotes, fundamental and
historical data, a specialized business news headline service,
portfolio features, links to online brokerage services, and other
investment-related services.

The price includes mandatory exchange fees of approximately
$13 per month to cover the New York, American, and Nasdaq stock
exchanges. Financial exchanges require individual investors, who
receive market trading data in real time, to sign contracts and pay
"certain fees" to those exchanges. DBC will manage the exchange
contract and fee process for the customer.

Larry Kramer, vice president of online services for DBC, told
Newsbytes, "Non-professionals have lower exchange fees than
professional financial users do. Every subscriber to DBC MarketWatch
must pay a monthly fee to the each of the exchanges. The total of all
the fees for our service is less than $13, and the fees are included
in the DBC monthly charge. Almost all online access to quotes are on
a 15 minute delay. This service is real time for a price of most
delayed services."

The new Internet-based DBC MarketWatch will allow new customers
access to large databases of historical, fundamental, and text data.
Eventually, DBC MarketWatch will be available to all of DBC's
real-time broadcast customers at no extra charge.

"DBC MarketWatch makes the world of real-time financial data
affordable to virtually any investor for the first time," said Alan
Hirschfield, DBC's co-chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We
think this is a prime example of how the Internet presents the
opportunity to bring valuable financial information to the public."

He continued: "Our real-time Internet product is designed to reach
the broad consumer market and to provide an affordable subset of the
information we offer over our private networks. This consumer service
represents a vast improvement over information traditionally available
at these price points to this audience -- which until now has largely
been restricted to data delayed at least 15 minutes."

According to DBC, delayed quotes have been available on DBC's Web
site for the past four months, where requests for these quotes are
currently averaging 750,000 hits per day.

Through its DBC West and BMI services, DBC now delivers real-time
stock quotes, financial and sports news and betting odds to more than
30,000 subscribers via wireless FM, cable, and satellite transmission.
Another DBC company -- Capital Management Sciences -- provides fixed
income portfolio analytics used for valuation and risk management.

 ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory 01/03/96

 ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory 01/03/96
RICHARDSON, TEXAS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Cyrix Corp. (NASDAQ:CYRX)
has announced it will report a loss for the quarter ending December 31,
and will take a write-off for its entire remaining inventory of 486 chips.

While final numbers aren't available yet, the company said the loss
could be more than $0.40 per share. The financial report is scheduled
for release after the market closes on January 18, 1996. For the first
nine months of the year, the company reported net income of $25.5
million, or $1.28 per share.

The loss, the first in the company's seven-year history, puts Cyrix
in technical default of terms of its credit agreements. Dumping the
486 products means the company is pinning its hopes of becoming a
significant challenger to Intel Corp.'s Pentium chip on Cyrix's M1
6x86 100 megahertz (MHz) and 120MHz chips. The M1 started shipping
in September, 1995.

Jerry Rogers, Cyrix chief executive officer, admits poor product
execution got him in trouble early in the year. He said the company
has about 300,000 486 chips on hand.

Cyrix has an $88 million agreement with IBM Credit Corp. and is
negotiating with IBM to extend a waiver on the technical violation.
The company stressed that it hasn't missed any debt payments and
has over $35 million in the bank.

Cyrix spokesperson Evan Fitzmaurice told Newsbytes the company
expects to report the outcome of the negotiations with IBM on
January 18, although the announcement could come sooner. .

Rogers said the company's 5x86 chip is selling well into the
portables market. He predicts 6x86 production of about 175,000
chips in the first quarter.

Cyrix shares dipped 2-1/8 to 23 after the announcement. Today
the stock had rebounded to $23.625.

America Online Warns Members Of Password Security 01/03/96

America Online Warns Members Of Password Security 01/03/96
VIENNA, VIRGINIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Acknowledging a password
security problem, America Online's (NASDAQ:AMER) president, Steve Case,
has sent a letter to all AOL subscribers urging them to never reveal
their passwords. To acquire AOL user passwords, hackers are reportedly
using e-mail and instant messages under the guise of AOL management.

In his letter to subscribers, Case says the latest hacker ploy is to
establish a correspondence which appears to come from AOL. A sample
letter reads in part: "Dear AOL Community Member: AOL is experiencing
major problems...due to a virus that was recently loaded...onto our main
user database, containing most of our member registration information,
we are currently experiencing widespread system failure. The problem
originated...when our system was illegally breached by a former employee."

America Online says that "this or any similar letter is entirely false
and should be reported to AOL management."

The letter continues with a description of a virus which supposedly
corrupted AOL's database link files and asks users to help the company
re-establish the database and help AOL solve the problem by providing
password information.

Online Instant Messages, known as IMs, are also being used to falsely
acquire passwords. A hacker will approach an AOL member with a
message identifying the sender as an AOL employee and attempt to
acquire a user's password.

Case clearly states the company's policy is to never have an employee
ask for a member's password under any condition. He requests that any
attempt or suspected attempt be immediately reported to AOL management.

Once a hacker has a user's password, hundreds of dollars of online time
can be charged to the user's account. Such information will not appear
until the user receives a monthly statement. AOL members who attempt
to sign onto the service and receive a message saying the account is
currently being used should also contact AOL immediately.

Advising members to be security conscious, Case suggests users change
their passwords to at least six alphanumeric characters for all of
their sub-accounts. As part of its service, AOL allows members to have
several different identities under sub-accounts. Passwords for all
accounts should be routinely changed.

Case also suggests that members do not use common words such as a
city, state, nickname, street, first name, address, or area codes as
passwords. Hackers often have programs which search for common words.

The letter closes saying the problem is not widespread, but deserves
immediate attention from the "entire AOL community." To combat the
problem, Case said "appropriate legal action" would be taken against
suspected perpetrators.

 ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC 01/03/96

 ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC 01/03/96
FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Although
the World Wide Web will undergo a temporary slowdown in 1996,
International Data Corp. (IDC) is "bullish" on the Internet's prospects
for the next five to 10 years, predicting growth in numbers of online
users to more than 200 million and in electronic commerce revenues
to more than $200 billion by the year 2000, said Frank Gens, senior
VP of research, in a conference call with Newsbytes.

Gens compared the Web's outlook for 1996 to the "lag time" that
set in for the PC industry during the 1982 to 1983 time frame,
when the supporting infrastructure for PCs remained "weak" and
some early users grew "disappointed."

Over the year ahead, a total of about 35 of the Fortune 500
companies will abandon their current commercial Web sites,
resulting in the emergence "ghost sites," Gens added.

At the same time, though, also by the close of 1996, somewhere
between 150 and 200 of the Fortune 500 firms can be expected to
open new Web sites, the senior VP told Newsbytes.

"First wave," back-office functions such as airline reservation
systems and "second wave" tasks in the area of office automation
will continue to be carried out on the Internet. But many of the
newer sites will be aimed at a "third wave" of Internet
applications, calling for online communications with consumers,
said Gens.

Accordingly, also over the coming year, PC makers will be making
consumers a major target. "Internet appliances" will hit the
market for as little as $100 to $300, and full-fledged multimedia
PCs will be available for under $1,000, not including monitor, he
reported.

"The next five to 10 years will also be an era of a turnover in
leaders," Gens asserted. Drawing another parallel with the PC
industry, the IDC exec pointed out that among today's top 20 IT
(information technology) manufacturers, only ten companies even
existed 10 or 15 years ago.

Online service providers will find that they must adapt to the
Web or fade away, Gens added, foreseeing a rough road ahead for
two of today's four major online service providers.

"Some (online service providers) will do well, but others will
culturally choke on the Web. The question will turn on whether
these companies can change their business models from the old,
proprietary `Club Med' model. Users are saying, `We don't want
this very safe, walled world. We don't want to be confined,'"
Newsbytes was told.

Current industry leaders like IBM, Apple, and Microsoft will also
be faced with tough choices, according to Gens. IBM will need to
decide whether to continue to target consumers via Prodigy.

Apple will have to determine whether to remain in the hardware
business, or to concentrate strictly on its long-time strength of
"human interface" software technology, either merging or
aligning itself with another OEM (original equipment manufacturer).

On Microsoft's part, the choice will boil down to focusing on
consumers through the Microsoft Network (MSN), or on Windows NT-
based office and Web servers, so as to avoid "stretching itself
too thin" in a market where "for the first time, Microsoft is not
setting all the rules."

"If I were Microsoft, I'd go toward the consumer," Gens noted. To
date, he added, Windows NT has not shown the "scalability" of
Unix, a "reality" that will become particularly important "with
all those users piling on to the Net."

On the whole, though, the Web will contribute to a growth in IT
industry revenues from $500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion by
2010, according to Gens.

Product areas that look particularly promising include object-
oriented development tools and, for telecommunications carriers,
local Internet access. "If (the US Telecommunications Act) goes
through, companies like AT&T, MCI, and Sprint will have carte
blanche. The monopoly of the local Bells will be broken."

Meanwhile, computer industry market analysts such as IDC are
adjusting their sights toward a view that encompasses broader
economics, taking into account not just revenues for IT companies
but for the other industries that stand to profit from the Web,
said Gens.

The Web will allow publishers, for example, to cut their costs by
80 percent, while at the same time enjoying "much broader market
reach" and instant distribution, he illustrated.

And insurance firms, which currently spend 60 cents on
distribution for every dollar earned, will be spared the expense
of sending a salesperson into "every prospect's living room," the
senior VP told Newsbytes.

These are the headlines and first paragraphs of each story, in order:

1 -> NewsPix Images For Newsbytes Publishers -- Photos are now posted as
they arrive, which means quicker access to the story pictures. The
bulletin will continue on Mondays, with updates Wednesdays and Fridays as
needed.

2 -> MoSys To Ship Multibank DRAM -- MoSys Inc. is set to begin shipment
of its Multibank dynamic random access memory (MDRAM) product. The MDRAM
is an extended-performance synchronous DRAM with high bandwidth, short
access times, and, according to the company, "unique pricing."

3 -> Ericsson Secures Further Mobitex Order In Singapore -- Ericsson has
secured another major order for its Mobitex radio packet data network
(PDN) in Singapore. This time the company has contracted with the TIBS
taxi fleet, which covers the colony with 800 vehicles, to install a
Mobitex system for use by drivers, customers, and staff of the company.

4 -> Motorola Claims Chinese Handwriting Breakthrough -- Motorola's
Lexicus Division has unveiled a Windows 95 handwriting recognition package
for the Chinese alphabet. According to officials with Lexicus, using the
package, writers will now be able to accurately input the 13,000 Chinese
characters into Windows 95 applications on standard desktop or notebook
computers.

5 -> Asia Newsbriefs -- In this roundup of news from across Asia: Korea -
Foreigners to invest in telecom companies; Indonesia - Mitsui to launch
pager service; Singapore - Telecom violations down; India, Malaysia -
Casio expands Asian production.

6 -> Japan Newsbriefs -- In this roundup of news from Japan: Hashimoto
ponders for NTT, KDD merger; NTT DoCoMo profits to surge; Star TV plans
Japanese channel; Short holidays at chip makers; Sanyo shifting
production; Ziff purchase to be partly funded by bonds issue; Sony to
enter video CD software market.

7 ->  ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight -- The decision
by Compuserve to remove 20 Usenet newsgroups after complaints from German
legislators is not the first time cross-border decency and obscenity has
reared its head in Europe. The British government has already experienced
the problems universal access can cause in the satellite television sector
and other nations have been angered by cross-border broadcasting.

8 -> Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed -- A judge
has dismissed the last two charges in a lawsuit that charged that Storage
Technology Corp. (NYSE: STK) had breached a 1990 agreement with Stuff
Technology Partners, a former development partner. Stuff had sought $2.4
billion in its original suit.

9 -> New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider -- Open Integration, a well-
known computer systems supplier, has set up a subsidiary operation to
offer Internet services. Known as Cyberphile, the Internet service
provider (SP) claims that, thanks to its parentage and a UKP500,000
investment in a fiber optic network spanning the UK, it can offer
"third-generation" Internet facilities to its customers.

10 -> Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI -- Telecom
Ireland has contracted with MCI to take a two megabits-per-second (Mbps)
link from Telecom Ireland's headquarters in Dublin to MCI's Internet
backbone in the US. According to David Hughes, a spokesperson for Telecom
Ireland, the link will mean that more than 40 percent of all Internet
traffic from Ireland travels over MCI's 45Mbps and 155Mbps backbone lines
in the US.

11 -> America Online Readies UK Rollout -- The UK will get its first taste
of America Online's European service later this month when the service is
officially launched to the media, prior to a formal public launch in
March, Newsbytes has learned. Although the plans are top secret prior to a
media launch in two weeks time, Newsbytes has discovered that UK pricing
has been set at UKP3.95 per month for up to five hours of access, and
extra hours billable at UKP1.85 each.

12 -> China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts -- The Chinese
version of Windows 95 has been put into large-scale production in
Shanghai. The Chinese version will follow the standard Chinese fonts and
input methods recommended by the Chinese Committee on Information
Technology Standards (CCITS).

13 -> China - Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom Project Founded -- An
Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom project has recently been founded by six
entities from China and Singapore with the intention of providing mobile
phone services to any place in the Asia-Pacific region.

14 -> Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth -- A recent
report released by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)
projects that, three years from now, there will be ten phones for every
one hundred Filipinos, and seven million main lines throughout the
Philippines. There are presently 1.9 million main lines in the country,
according to the NTC report.

15 -> Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI -- Printer sales in
the Asia-Pacific region do not exhibit any signs of being affected by the
move towards a "paperless office concept," or a part implementation of it
in the near future, despite the growing awareness and compliance regarding
electronic data interchange (EDI) by certain industry and government
segments in the region. This is according to International Data
Corporation (IDC), a market research and consulting firm.

16 -> Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation -- Cisco Systems Inc.
has announced the opening of its representative office in the Philippines.

17 -> Canadian Product Launch Update -- This regular feature, appearing on
the first day Newsbytes publishes each week, provides further details for
the Canadian market on announcements by international companies that
Newsbytes has already covered. This week: Lotus Development's new Notes
Mail client and changes in Notes pricing.

18 ->  ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble -- The telecommunications reform
legislation has become a political house of cards that could collapse with
the slightest ill wind. Prospects for passage remain in doubt with
Congress back in Washington and seemingly paralyzed by the budget impasse.

19 -> Federal Shutdown Web Page -- As Washington enters the third week of
the partial government shutdown, a local business has created a World Wide
Web site intended to help tourists find places to visit in the Nation's
Capital.

20 -> Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute -- Texas
Instruments Inc. (NYSE: TXN) and Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd
could be chipping away at each other in a courtroom if the two companies
can't settle patent infringement allegations.

21 ->  ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups -- CompuServe made
international headlines this past week when it announced it would
temporarily suspend access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups. Contacted
by German authorities, the online giant was told the delivery of "certain
specified newsgroups" carrying pornographic material constituted a
violation of German criminal law.

22 ->  ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs -- Breaking up,
as the song said, is hard to do. That's especially true if you work for
AT&T (NYSE:T), which has announced it will cut about 40,000 jobs in its
telecommunications services and systems and technology companies as these
and AT&T Global Information Solutions become independent firms.

23 -> STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems -- STD Systems
Inc. has begun shipping its Power2 workstations and servers, based on
PowerPC chips, to Canadian universities, government buyers, and smaller
corporations. The company claimed it is the first to build PowerPC systems
in Canada.

24 -> Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption -- Security Dynamics
plans to license "Concryption," a just patented technology combining
encryption and compression, to outside companies for use with a variety of
security and compression protocols, revealed Kenneth Weiss, chairman and
chief technical officer, during an interview with Newsbytes.

25 -> Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product -- Pipeline
Communications Inc. rolled into the new year with the release of Pipeline
API Toolkit for Windows 95, an electronic customer registration product
which provides hardware and software developers with tools to enable
online registration of Windows 95 programs.

26 -> Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month -- Data Broadcasting Corporation
(NASDAQ: DBCC) has announced a new Internet financial data service, DBC
MarketWatch. It will offer real-time stock market data over the Internet
at prices now charged for delayed services.

27 ->  ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory -- Cyrix
Corp. (NASDAQ:CYRX) has announced it will report a loss for the quarter
ending December 31, and will take a write-off for its entire remaining
inventory of 486 chips.

28 -> America Online Warns Members Of Password Security -- Acknowledging a
password security problem, America Online's (NASDAQ:AMER) president, Steve
Case, has sent a letter to all AOL subscribers urging them to never reveal
their passwords. To acquire AOL user passwords, hackers are reportedly
using e-mail and instant messages under the guise of AOL management.

29 ->  ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC -- Although
the World Wide Web will undergo a temporary slowdown in 1996,
International Data Corp. (IDC) is "bullish" on the Internet's prospects
for the next five to 10 years, predicting growth in numbers of online
users to more than 200 million and in electronic commerce revenues to more
than $200 billion by the year 2000, said Frank Gens, senior VP of
research, in a conference call with Newsbytes.

OBJECT-ORIENTED STRATEGIES via NewsNet
October 1991

A NEW NEWSLETTER

     We had originally intended this to be the September issue of
Intelligent Software Strategies, a newsletter that we have been
publishing for the last six years (originally as Expert Systems
Strategies).  But the rapidly growing amount of information on
object-oriented products and applications led us to conclude that
we could better serve our subscribers by starting a second
newsletter.
     Before deciding to launch a newsletter on object-oriented
technology, we surveyed the market to see if other newsletters
were already covering the same subjects that we will cover.  We
didn't find any.  Object-Oriented Strategies will begin with a
survey of the entire market.  Having grouped products into
competitive niches, we will provide information about the key
concerns facing managers trying to decide when and how to use
products from each niche.  As major contenders emerge within a
niche, we will provide reviews that compare and contrast the key
products.  (Our hard-hitting reviews will be designed to help
managers make tough decisions.  We don't accept advertising.)  We
will report on how companies are actually using object-oriented
technology and what kinds of problems they are encountering.  In
addition, every few months, we will step back and provide an
overview of the whole market so that readers can keep the big
picture in mind.  Our newsletter is designed for managers and
developers who are charged with buying and using object-oriented
technologies in corporate environments.
     Our focus is not on research trends or noncommercial
products and applications.  We will not include information about
management changes or announcements of new versions; readers can
get these in the weekly computer newspapers.  We will notify
readers of announcements that illustrate significant trends and
deserve to be placed in some broader context.  Occasionally we
will have articles by specialists in niche markets, but the great
majority of the newsletter will be written by Paul Harmon and
Curt Hall.  This will assure a comprehensive, consistent
perspective on this rapidly developing technology.  We are
convinced that no other newsletter can offer the market
expertise, managerial perspective, and comprehensive coverage we
intend to provide.

THE OBJECT-ORIENTED MARKET IN THE FALL OF 1991

     The move toward object-oriented (OO) technology marks a very
fundamental change in the development, maintenance, and use of
computer software.  Interest in object-oriented programming (OOP)
is very intense at the moment, but the market for products is
just beginning.  Most companies are just starting to experiment
with OO technologies.  The market for products should grow
substantially over the next three years.
     A wide variety of object-oriented products are being
introduced very quickly.  The current crop of object-oriented
products ranges from languages and software development tools to
operating systems, networks, and databases.  The market for these
products is new and most people have difficulty discriminating
between the uses and features of the different products.  To make
things even more confusing, the generic term "object" has been
used in computing in a variety of different ways.  And, of
course, some people are trying to cash in on the current interest
in OO technology by claiming that their projects have OO
capabilities when they don't.
     Figure 1 provides an easy way to conceptualize the overall
market and current and future trends (see printed version of this
issue, available from Cutter Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939 or
(617) 648-8700).  In effect, all computing will shift in the
course of the 1990s.  By the end of this decade, three new types
of products will replace a wide variety of current products.
     Object-Oriented Operating Systems will replace the existing
crop of operating systems.  A true OO operating system will
combine the ease of an object-oriented environment with OO-based
development tools and an OO-based client-server architecture.
This will ensure that all systems running the operating system
can transparently communicate with other operating systems on
local area networks.
     The Mac operating system, Windows 3.0, and New Wave are
steps in the direction of a true object-oriented operating
system, but they are only first approximations.  Until there is a
real OO operating system, there will be lots of products
competing to enhance existing operating systems.  Once true OO
operating systems appear and begin to gain market share, they
will eliminate the need for most of the current operating system
interface development and enhancement products.
     Object-Oriented Application Development Tools will replace
the existing group of OO languages (OOLs) and OO environments,
CASE tools, and expert systems tools.  In effect, these products
will either merge or eliminate each other in competition, until
powerful application development environments emerge and come to
dominate corporate software development.  The wide variety of
CASE and application development tools will soon narrow to a few
tools that will incorporate all of the basic paradigms.
     Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs) will replace relational
databases by the end of the decade.  Meanwhile, OODBs will
develop as the preferred databases for more specialized
applications like CAD/CAM.  The large-scale success of OODBs will
depend on the prior acceptance of OO-based client-server
networks and the continued technological push of more complex
applications (e.g., multimedia).  The success of OODBs will mean
that databases, individually or collectively, will become a model
of the company and that class libraries used in both the
operating system and the application development tools will be
kept in OODBs.
     Most of the current object-oriented products should be
thought of as approximations or steps toward one of these three
products.  It follows that there will be increased competition or
mergers between products that are tending toward the same
ultimate end.  Thus, CASE tools, expert systems tools, and OO
languages and tools will necessarily find themselves
incorporating features currently possessed by the other types of
products as they fight for the same customers.

Object-Oriented Products

     Figure 2 is an overview of the object-oriented market in the
US (see printed version of this issue, available from Cutter
Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939, (617) 648-8700).  We have
divided the market into niches by clustering products with
similar functionality.  Initially we wanted to include a
comprehensive list of the OO products being sold in each niche,
but it proved too large for a single page.  Instead, we list some
of the better known products to illustrate the constituents of
each group.  The rows suggest some of the very different uses to
which object-oriented techniques are being applied.  We have
further divided the products by suggesting where they lie on a
continuum that runs from languages through environments to tools
or shells and finally to finished applications.  (This continuum
gets a little fuzzy in some cases, but the general idea is that
products to the right are built using products to the left.
Likewise, products on the left require more programming skills
while products closer to the right side are more likely to be
used by end users.)
     Products in bold type in Figure 2 are those that we will
consider in more detail later in the newsletter (Tables 1-4 in
the printed version of this issue, available from Cutter
Information Corp.; (800) 888-8939 or (617) 648-8700).  We will
consider other products in detail in future issues on OO
operating systems, OODBs, and interface builders.  Before
considering specifics, however, let's consider each of the
general niches suggested by Figure 2.

OO Programming Languages

     There are a number of different OOLs.  New OOLs are being
developed, and in many cases there are several compilers
available for a single OOL.  From a commercial perspective, there
is only one OOL of any importance: C++.  We expect that the
commercial interest in Smalltalk and other more flexible OOLs
will fade as developers realize that they want to work in tools
rather than languages.  We observed this same phenomenon in the
AI world.  Initially theorists argued about Prolog and Lisp and
assured everyone else that they would need to use a symbolic
language to really do the kinds of things they would want to do.
In five years everyone realized that they could do everything
they wanted in powerful tool environments while developing
programs much faster than they ever could in a language.  C++
would be uncommercial if it weren't positioned as the next
generation of C.  As it is, many companies are experimenting with
an OOL to learn what the technology is all about.  By 1993, the
emphasis will be entirely on tools and the number of language
vendors will have decreased considerably.

OO Programming Environments

     As you move across the continuum, the first place to the
right of a language is the programming environment, with a class
library and some editing and display utilities.  Since OOLs tend
to include most of these things in the basic language, it's very
easy for language vendors to expand their libraries and create an
environment.  This is exactly what ParcPlace did when it moved
from Smalltalk80 to ObjectWorks.

OO Application Development Tools

     One more step to the right and you arrive at a tool or
shell.  A tool should provide an application development
environment that is similar to a CASE tool.  A tool ought to have
everything an environment has plus a lot more.  A tool certainly
ought to have a graphical interface and interface development
utilities.  In addition, tools usually incorporate code
generation capabilities.  A great example of an OO tool is
Prograph.  Prograph structures the application development
process so well that it places Macintosh OO application
development within the range of nonprogrammers.  You don't write
code in Prograph, you create diagrams and the tool generates the
code.

Class Libraries

     Some companies are offering class libraries by themselves.
We don't expect this to last very long.  Tool vendors will
incorporate libraries and developers will find it much easier to
examine and use libraries within an application or interface
development tool.

OO Design Tools

     Object International is offering tools that document OO
analysis and design efforts, using the Coad-Yourdon notational
system.  This type of product might sell for a while, but it will
surely disappear as soon as OO development tools or CASE tools
offer graphical analysis and design interfaces that are directly
tied to code generation capabilities.

Conventional CASE Tools

     There are a number of conventional CASE vendors that claim
they are adding OO capabilities to their products.  The claims
are rather weak just now, but over the course of the next three
or four years we expect that at least some of the major CASE
vendors will incorporate powerful, graphical OO programming
environments within their products.  The problem they face is
modifying the structured, procedural methodologies that most
conventional CASE users expect to use.  The OO application
development tool vendors are free to start from scratch and
develop their products around an OO methodology.  The
conventional CASE vendors will try to combine a conventional
methodology with an OO methodology.  The advantage of the OO
vendors' approach will be elegance and clarity, while the
conventional CASE vendors' approach will be popular with the
large number of programmers that use structured methodologies.
We expect that many CASE vendors will try to resolve their
dilemma by buying OO development tools and offering their
customers two different approaches.

OO Operating Systems

     Within three years we will see true OO operating systems.
In the meantime, we see operating systems that provide only
limited OO capabilities.  The Mac operating system has offered a
number of OO capabilities for a long time and many people
associate windows and graphics with OOP.  Suffice it to say that
if there were any real OO operating systems in common use, there
wouldn't be a market for the OO interface development tools that
are springing up all over the place.

OO Operating System Interface Development Tools

     Interface development tools are built around class libraries
that make it easy to develop an interface for one or more
operating systems.  The tool makes it easy to assemble the
interface, and in most cases, makes it easy to attach code to the
interface that is developed.  Borland's ObjectVision is a nice
example of a graphical, 4GL interface developer that allows the
developer to create an interface form and then relate data from
Borland spreedsheets or databases to appropriate slots on the
form.  As long as operating systems like Windows 3.0 are popular,
developers will need tools to help them develop user interfaces.
As OO operating systems become available, the functionality
provided by the interface development tools will be incorporated
into the operating system itself.

Hypermedia Languages and Hypermedia Environments
     Hypermedia languages and environments facilitate limited,
user-friendly object-oriented programming.  We assume that true
OO operating systems will incorporate most of the features people
like about HyperCard and ToolBook, and that most of this
functionality will simply become part of a good operating system.
Meanwhile, however, hypermedia constitute the main interface
between OO technology and lots of end users.

OO Databases
     Some of the OODBs are really databases, but most of the
products in this category are OODB management systems that rely
on more conventional databases to actually store data.  There
will be a fight between the relational database vendors and the
true OODB vendors to see which will prevail.  We assume that, in
the long run, the true OODB vendors will prevail and corporate
databases will gradually become dynamic simulations of the
corporations that create them.

Expert Systems Tools
     The best expert systems tools include powerful OO
programming environments.  Moreover, the better expert systems
tools are already adapted to conventional IS environments (CICS
and IMS, VMS, Unix, PCs, various relational databases, etc.).  As
companies become serious about developing and fielding major
object-oriented systems, the expert systems vendors will find
themselves competing with the major OO development environments.

CAD/CAM Tools
     There are a number of problem- or domain-specific
application development tools that depend on OO techniques.  The
current crop of CAD/CAM tools is a good example.  Developers
using CAD/CAM tools may not think of themselves as OO
programmers, but they are currently developing applications using
some of the most sophisticated OO tools on the market.

Other Niches
     We didn't consider applications in this article, although
there are fielded applications in most of the categories we have
discussed.  (We'll feature outstanding commercial applications of
OO technology in the May issue of OOS.)
     Another use of OO technology that we left out of Figure 2
involves the use of OO technology in OO-based client-server
systems.  We expect that all client-server systems will
eventually be based on an OO architecture and that future OO
operating systems will incorporate the ability to manage sending
and receiving messages from any other client or server on the
network.
     Given this brief overview of the wide variety of different
products that all incorporate OO techniques, it's not surprising
that companies and programmers new to the field often become
confused about what OO is or what it's good for.  In the months
ahead we'll explore each of these niches in more detail.  We'll
consider the key technical concepts and the resistance each group
of products will face as it vies for commercial acceptance.  We
will also review the strengths and weaknesses of both the leading
products in each niche and the companies that are promoting them.
(In February 1992 we will begin our annual estimates of the
market size and project the annual growth of each of these market
niches.)

OMG Settles on ORB

     The Object Management Group (OMG), formed in 1989, is the
leading object-oriented (OO) standards group in the world.
Virtually every major software and hardware company involved in
OO technology is working under the OMG umbrella to establish
standards to facilitate the growth of OO technology.  OMG's
first goal is a standard format for passing messages on a
network, called the Object Request Broker (ORB).
     OMG requires that its standards be on existing,
commercial-grade technology.  The company proposing an approach
agrees to license its technology for relatively little money and
OMG members agree that they will support whatever technology is
chosen.
     OMG put out a request for ORB technology in the fall of
1990.  Initially, the group accepted 10 proposals.  By June 1991,
at Object World (OMG's annual convention), the ORB proposals were
down to 2: (1) The HP/Sun proposal (also supported by NCR and
ODI) and (2) The HyperDesk/DEC proposal.  Each proposal embodies
a technically different approach to message passing.
     The HP/Sun/NCR/ODI proposal.  This proposal embodies a
static approach to message passing, based on a new language
called class definition language (CDL).  CDL structures the
classes and relationships to be used in an application
integration scheme.  It also involves an application programming
interface (API) for accessing the functionality of those
structures at run time, and a distributed object management
facility (DOMF).  Together, the CDL language and the DOMF API
provide a static language-based solution to building distributed
applications.  In theory, a static approach should result in
faster message passing since most of the work can be precompiled.
It should also facilitate compile-time type checking, and the
unique language definition should lead to greater portability
than one written in an existing language.
     The HyperDesk/DEC proposal.  This proposal embodies a
dynamic approach to message passing.  It assumes an application
interface (syntax) that can be called from C, C++, or other
languages.  The argument for a dynamic approach, of course, is
that one often can't anticipate the priority of the interfaces
that might be used at runtime.  In return for building parameter
argument lists and marshaling arguments at run time, the dynamic
API approach allows decisions to be made as late as possible.
This is especially important for applications like browsers and
resource managers.  In addition, this approach doesn't require
learning another language; the developer writes the calls in a
language he or she already knows, like C or C++.
     Faced with a choice between a static definition language
(CDL) or dynamic calling from within an existing language, the
ORB committee decided it wanted both and asked the two groups to
combine the two approaches.
     The decision to accept a common standard for message passing
represents a major triumph for OMG and the OO industry as a
whole.  It also suggests that the way to set standards is to get
in early and choose a very basic technology.  Even if all OMG
members support the ORB, they will still be able to implement it
in a number of different ways.  (An application can handle
messages any way it wants internally, it only needs a mechanism
to convert outgoing and incoming messages from the accepted ORB
format.)
     OMG's next task is to define a model for an object and
specify its use in data management.  Since this will come a lot
closer to implementation, OMG may find consensus on a model much
harder to come by.  Still, it is off to a good start and wide-
spread acceptance of even its initial effort should speed the
acceptance of OO techniques and open systems.  (We'll consider
the ORB in greater detail in a future issue when we consider OO
operating systems and networks.)

Borland C++ & Application Frameworks

     Application frameworks are intended to simplify application
development by providing an object-oriented (OO) foundation on
which to build software.  In effect, they enhance programmer
productivity by providing a prebuilt application that can be
customized, instead of forcing developers to write programs from
scratch.
     Borland, which has been particularly successful in offering
languages and environments for OOP development, has announced
that it is now bundling its popular C++ programming language with
two new application framework facilities for developing programs
for MS Windows and DOS operating systems.  According to Gene
Wang, VP and GM of Borland's Language Business Unit, Borland has
shipped more than 400,000 copies of C++.
     The new product -- Borland C++ & Application Frameworks --
includes two new application frameworks: ObjectWindows and Turbo
Vision.
     ObjectWindows provides a generic, functioning Windows
application that can be used as a template to save programmers
time and code.  It lets programmers add windows, menus, dialogs,
buttons, list boxes, edit fields, icons, etc. to their
applications.  Full source code for ObjectWindows is included as
well.
     Turbo Vision provides basically the same functionality in
the DOS environment that ObjectWindows provides for the Windows
environment, enabling programmers to produce DOS applications
with character-based Windows user interfaces.  Full source code
for Turbo Vision is also included.
     Borland C++ & Application Frameworks includes Borland C++
2.0, which has a 100% ANSI C compiler, a C++ compiler, and
provides complete support for developing Windows applications,
including Dynamic Link Libraries and EXEs.  The Whitewater
resource toolkit is also included, which allows programmers to
write Windows applications without using the MS Windows' Software
Development Kit.
     Borland C++ & Application Frameworks runs on IBM PCs and
100% compatibles and sells for $695.  Current Borland C++ users
can upgrade to Borland C++ & Application Frameworks for $199.95;
ObjectWindows or Turbo Vision for $99.95.
     In other developments, Borland is selling "The World of
Objects," a videotape aimed at expanding the use of OOP
technology, narrated by Philippe Kahn, Borland's chairman,
president, and CEO.  The video features such leading computer
scientists as Alan Kay (Apple), Marvin Minsky (MIT), Bjarne
Stroustrup (designer of C++, AT&T Bell Labs), Joseph Weizenbaum
(professor of Computer Science, MIT), and Niklaus Wirth (designer
of Pascal and professor of Computer Science, ETH Zurich).
     In "The World of Objects," Mr.  Kahn uses real-world
metaphors to explain OOP and how this revolution in software
technology benefits both software developers and end users.  The
21-minute videotape (VHS) is intended for software developers and
technical programmers who want to learn more about OOP
technology.  It retails for $19.99.

IBM Continues Push Into OO Domain

     About four months ago, IBM announced that its CASE
repository, AD/Cycle, would be based on an object-oriented (OO)
foundation.  Two months ago, IBM stunned the computing world by
announcing a joint venture with Apple to develop a new OO
operating system (based on a system underway at Apple, code-named
"Pink").  IBM has also integrated former Metaphor personnel into
the operating system effort.  Now, in a series of announcements
made in September, IBM has not only reinforced its commitment to
open systems, but stated that it will expand its concept of
Netview into a multivendor, enterprise-wide network management
system.  (The new version of Netview will be Version 2, Release
3.  No shipment date has been set.)  At the same time, the
company announced that its Network product will combine two
graphical standards, GMF (Graphics Monitor Facility) and
Netcenter.  To facilitate this, the new version will incorporate
a "Resource Object Data Manager," a kind of OO clearinghouse that
will provide real-time information about the status and
configuration of both IBM and non-IBM networks.
     IBM claims that the OO component of the Netview system will
make it easier for developers to create network management
applications and will guarantee that users of applications based
on the Resource Object Data Manager will be able to manage
worldwide networks in real-time.
     Surveys of IS managers at Fortune 500 companies indicate
that most have heard about OOP, but consider it a technology for
the future and not one of today's high priorities.  As IBM keeps
announcing products that depend on OO techniques, and that will
underlie most of the systems that Fortune 500 IS managers will be
depending upon in the years ahead, corporate consciousness
regarding OOP and the urge to find out more about the technology
will grow rapidly.  In fact, given IBM's moves, we expect that
1992 will find OOP at the top of most IS managers' lists of
things to find out about.

Alpha Site: Tool time for pc makers

By:
Rick Boyd-Merritt

I'm not much of a handyman around the house. I avoid preventive
maintenance of any sort and only operate in a reactive mode,
trying to fix things that have broken. I toss the odd collection
of tools I have higgledy-piggledy into a cupboard above our
washing machine. God help me when I need something specific
like a penny nail and have to fish around through the dregs
of that cupboard! The point of this little domestic confession
is that I believe the PC industry operates in the same sorry
way. OEMs don't think much about preventive maintenance.

They let Intel or Microsoft or, sometimes, Compaq make their
regular service calls on the PC architecture, assuming that's
enough to keep things humming. Every once in a while, a pipe
bursts, and they go digging around for a tool to deal with
the emergency. As often as not, the rusty, ill-kept tool box
takes the form of an occasional meeting place known as the
Video Electronics Standards Association.

VESA's been around since 1989 and lays claim to some 30-odd
standards. But the impact of the group has been a mixed bag.
It's produced helpful bench-level engineering specifications,
such as monitor timings. But its work on issues of broad impact
have often been met with push back from companies such as Intel
and Microsoft, who often sit imperiously at the periphery of
the group.

Thus, the VESA Local (VL) Bus made a significant contribution
to 486 systems but was snuffed out by the steamroller of the
PCI bus from Intel. Similarly, the Unified Memory Architecture
spec drafted by VESA now sits under a cloud generated by Microsoft's
lack of support for it and a competing approach being implemented
by Intel. A VESA set-top group was folded primarily because
its work was not timely or relevant enough for the emerging
market it hoped to serve; a new cable-modem group could face
a similar fate.

The problem lies in how the PC industry takes care of its tools.
There are 250 members in VESA, but organizers say it is a stellar
event when 30 turn out for a meeting on any single issue. Other
issues struggle along with a fraction of that support, often
from engineers who carry all too little clout with their companies,
resulting in meetings sometimes defined by the agenda of a
small group.

Worse yet, VESA doesn't even hold together well. Vendors try
to drive those issues in which they have a vested interest
and ignore others. The group hit rock-bottom recently when
member Dell Computer tried to collect royalties for a patent
relating to the VL Bus.

The computer industry desperately needs a strong open forum
that can shepherd the PC architecture through the changes it
faces over the next few years. VESA could be it-if we learn
how to take care of our tools.

The Net is Key

By:
Anonymous, via the Internet

The idea of a WorldPC/NetworkPC [November, page 28] is a very
welcome one. A mass-market, $500 to $800 computer is feasible,
and it will transform the PC industry if industry leaders pursue
the idea wholeheartedly.

Every person should own such an information appliance. The crucial
part is the network-a reliable, affordable, Internet-connected
network with at least ISDN speed. Currently, that essential
part is mostly missing. So I don't expect the World PC idea
to succeed in the United States within the next two years.
After that, things will change.

Accolades from Apple

By:
Warren D. Raisch, Manager, Apple Pacific, Business Development,

"The World PC" [November, page 28] was fantastic. Your ideas
and research were right on the money. Congratulations: You
articulated the opportunity perfectly.

I am a senior business development executive at Apple Computer
in Cupertino, Calif., but I am leaving Apple shortly to start
a venture. Your article reads almost exactly like my business
plan.

I have gathered $20 million in initial seed capital and am considering
partnering with Apple on certain technology areas. But I believe
that it will not be the PC vendors that will bring the World
PC to market. I believe that it will be driven by a cooperative
of consumer-electronics companies and large network-service
providers. Your article correctly points out the significant
opportunity in working with developing nations on this vision.
I have spent much of the past 16 years working with developing
nations' governments, the World Bank, the UN and private-sector
partners to build an IT infrastructure that could easily leapfrog
what we have in the United States. At this point, the barriers
are more psychological than technological.

Once again, congratulations on an outstanding article.

World PC Won't Sell

By:
Dave Ray, via the Internet

I recently read your article on the World PC and felt compelled
to comment. I don't know how long you've been around MIS or
DP, but I have been in DP for almost 28 years and have watched
the centralization/decentralization issue as well as the upsize
downsize paradigm. It never fails to amaze me that people actually
believe these have provided real benefit. The World PC is just
another stab at something that won't sell.

I used to punch my own programs and dreamed of the day when
I would just have a terminal. The ability to have a fully functional
PC that can do most of what a mainframe does (and lots of what
it can't do) is something the World PC would take away. How
can a machine that only has 16 meg of memory and no hard drive
do anything? Get real: If that was all that was needed, the
386 with 16 meg of memory would have been just the ticket-but
you know how fast it failed. Without storage, it's just a dumb
terminal.

Consider the cost reduction in terms of computing power. Why
would anyone want a $1,000 dumb terminal, when a Pentium with
8 meg and an 800-meg hard drive can be gotten for $2,000? Future
technologies will reduce the cost even more while providing
more power.

Have you seen any of the surveys regarding the public's desire
for this type of machine? Not one has found favor with the
idea. One of the few that touts this philosophy is Oracle-and
Oracle is one of the few companies that has not hit the mark
on any hardware or application it has created or promoted.
True, it has a great DBMS, but other than that, it fails miserably.

Power Prose

By:
John Ockerman, via the Internet

Thanks for your article in the November issue ("Batteries Aweigh,"page
72). It is an excellent review of the portable power market.
The arrival of the laptop catalyzed battery and charger development
like nothing else I can recall during 30-plus years in the
battery industry.

In the 1980s, while at Exide, I helped the Department of Energy
spend $160 million on EV battery improvements. For their money,
they got maybe 50 Wh/kg lead-acid, and nothing much better
is available today. It is tough to compete with gasoline, at
34,000 Wh/gallon.

The work at Integrated Circuit Systems Inc., is one of the best
approaches to fast charging that I know about. With Dave Whitmer's
help, I've used its chips in the lab and at home. I hope ICS
succeeds in taming lithium-ion charging, but I wouldn't be
surprised if another, safer lithium system comes along soon.
An unsatisfied market for power at $200/pound and up is a terrific
incentive.

Fighting Bloatware

By:
S. Y. Wong, via the Internet

"The World PC" [November, page 28] was very timely. I have been
visiting China since 1989 and find that the PC situation has
changed dramatically. My nephew's son acquired an entry-level
486SX machine upon his graduation from college. The machine
was about $1,000. The operating system, UCDOS, is DOS with
the character type modified to be 8 bits, with the eighth bit
encoding 1-byte ASCII or 2-byte Chinese GB-2312. The UCDOS
has an extender and interesting graphics but is only somewhat
larger than DOS, if the character-font library is not counted.

One of the biggest resource burners in PCs are the "modern"
operating systems, which are all patterned after the obsolete
concept of "multi-programming," invented for CPU time-sharing
back when CPU costs were prohibitive. Indeed, all computer
chips, CISC or RISC, are patterned after the CPU concept, which
dates back to the mainframe. The combination of obsolete processor
operating-system design approaches has combined to keep costs
high and memory requirements large.

What the industry needs is a design approach that weighs processor
and OS design as an integrated whole. The United States lacks
technical leadership of the caliber needed to pull off such
a bold strategy. In China, where bloatware does not quite suit
the economy, there is more opportunity for an entrepreneur
to implement such a grand vision. But luckily for the United
States, China tends to blindly follow America's lead.

Still, you might sound the warning that the United States could
lose its computer leadership, just as it lost earlier leadership
positions in such industries as clothing, footwear and TV sets.

Data Blaster

By:
Jay Knutson, niwot@csn.net, via the Internet

"The Broadcast PC is on the air" [November, page 64] was an
interesting article. However, Niwot Networks, using its file
transfer kits (hardware and software), can move data over dial
up telephones lines for one-fifth the price listed by Direct
Satellite System/DirecTv. Our customers-the most modern printing,
pre-press and magazine publishers-can deliver Mbytes on demand
for 11 to 20 cents/

Mbyte. That is better than Syquest disks and Federal Express
($28 to go, $28 to retrieve-meaning $56 for a 100-Mbyte disk).
And it arrives in minutes, not the next day at 10:30.

Krill or Cetacean?

By:
John Amenyo, via the Internet

"The World PC" [November, page 28] was an important and timely
look at the future of mainstream computing in the age of the
network. But several of the industry experts whom you relied
on for your conclusions demonstrated glaring examples of poor
strategic thinking. One could ascribe the lack of success of
the videotex to such confusion among the supposed visionaries
of the computing industry.

You wrote of an "awakening hunger for information, entertainment
and connectivity." I hope that by "connectivity" you mean the
need and urge to participate in electronic communities. If
so, I agree.

But you then veer off in the wrong direction by advancing the
opinion that "the potential of a machine that could satisfy
that hunger at a price tag of a few hundred dollars is enormous."
The leap to that conclusion is unwarranted. Total usage costs,
not merely the cost of the access unit, are the real barrier
to the Internet and Infobahn. The access-unit cost is easily
amortized. But the overall monthly costs of (remote) content
usage must truly fit people's budgets. That holds even more
true for the developing countries.

Another of your assertions that is not very useful is that "there
is disposable income, but it does not come in packages of $3,000
per household. It comes-dearly-in chunks of a few hundred dollars
at a time." True enough, but the implications here are misleading.
An assumed amortization schedule of $83/month is within the
range of a typical household phone bill (including long-distance
calls). Further, for several generations now, marketers have
perfected ways of handling the "bulk vs. chunk" income problem
 financing, credit arrangements and lease/rent-to-buy options.

It is a strategic delusion for a PC vendor selling into the
Internet/Web market to rely on the following kinds of assertions

 "In [the] server-centric view of computing, a network of servers
provides the data: from bank accounts to document archives
to the latest movies and games. The servers also run the heavy
parts of the applications. All the home computer does is run
'applets,' which are fragments of software that do just enough
local computing to minimize the system's communications-bandwidth
needs."

"One of the most important aspects of the $500 home computer
is that it is inherently a networked architecture, not a standalone
machine. For this reason, the rules of the road are entirely
different from a standalone's. For starters, local storage
 . . . is an unwarranted expense. The network can store and
deliver any necessary data. It can execute all but the tiny
applets of all the applications. And it can do this for only
a service charge."

That makes sense only if one assumes that in both the standalone
(application/desktop-centric) and networked (server-centric)
cases, the non-computing costs (i.e., the communication and
information costs) are zero or insignificant. Not on Terra.

Consider the matter from the consumer's viewpoint. Who will
own the PC? Who will own the network/connectivity and access
services? Who will own the content? How much will the "service
charge" be-the "toll" that will have to be paid every time
the consumer wishes to do anything that is even mildly interesting?
It is a fantasy on the part of minimalist World PC advocates
that consumers will be satisfied forever with a "look-but-don't
touch" approach to information consumption.

In the same vein, music-on-demand, video-on-demand and interactive
TV will all fail if all the user gets to do is treat the Internet
Web like a giant jukebox in a honky-tonk bar. What if a user
wishes to embellish and save the multimedia experience karaoke
style? A minimalist World PC would prevent that. People want
to pay to download and store copies of multimedia objects.

One thing is clear: The consumer will have to pay something
to somebody. The first question is how much. An even more important
question is to whom. Would information consumers find it more
palatable to pay the PC/software vendors, or would they rather
most of the money go to the networking/service providers? That's
the crux of the issue.

In your current daily life, which do you prefer? Do you like
to rent or lease things and pay for usage, or do you prefer
to buy and own them? Automobiles are very expensive, houses
even more so. But do most consumers prefers to own such items,
or to lease or rent them?

In my opinion, the strategic action needed to jump-start a social
revolution rivaling Guttenberg's is clear: Use the on-rushing
advances in technology to drive down the total usage costs
of travel on the worldwide information superhighway. That will
require very low cost but full-featured access stations. I
would strongly advise that the industry not proceed on the
model of the "PCjr," with crippled features and no frills.
Industry experience has been that it has never worked, and
nothing has happened to suggest that it now could be a successful
strategy.

I strongly believe the future of the PC for the Infobahn belongs
to the "beast" you blithely dismissed: a "Pentium-powered home
multimedia PC, supplied with a huge disk and at least 16 Mbytes
of DRAM, armed with specialized hardware for graphics, 3-D,
video and even telephone calls."

Who, after all, is the king of the ocean: the krill or the cetacean?

A Battery No-Go

By:
Greg Smith, Ultralife Batteries Inc., Montvale, N.J.

I have several comments on the "Batteries Aweigh" article [November,
page 72], which was generally very good: The observation that
cycle life and environmental issues will be paramount considerations
for OEMs is right on the mark. And the observation that lithium
ion is likely to supplant nickel-based batteries, particularly
as its costs come down over time, is also accurate. But lithium
polymer, meaning rechargeable batteries using lithium in its
metallic form, should not be occupying so many column inches
at this stage of the game.

Though lithium-metal is a battery maker's dream, it is not suitable
for rechargeable batteries. A lithium-metal battery's cycle
life is too limited (150 cycles), and the potential for catastrophic
failure is too severe. A particular problem is buildup of dendritic
structures on the lithium electrode, which eventually can pierce
the separator and cause an internal short-circuit.

The one-time leading proponent of lithium-polymer technology
was a company called Valence Technology. But Valence no longer
promotes the technology vigorously and has, in fact, made an
effort to switch to lithium-ion technology similar to Ultralife's.

Skinny or FUD?

By:
David Hunter, PC Product Manager, Spectron Microsystems, via

Well, the good news is that your "inside skinny" note ("The
inside skinny on native signal processing," October, page 58)
apparently is well read-at least by the newsgroup contributors.
The bad news is that your anonymous PC maker is either badly
informed or specifically intent on misleading your readers.

Spox is definitely a major component of NSP. In fact, all of
the Windows 3.1 interfaces provided by IA-Spox are virtually
the same under Windows 95. The only public changes that have
been made are those that were absolutely necessary to support
full 32-bit application programming interfaces.

If you want more details, I'd be glad to forward a copy of a
PowerPoint presentation I wrote last month. And if you really
want to go into it, I'd be glad to send you a CD copy of our
latest beta. Want to develop your own real-time signal-processing
code on the Pentium?

So, do you think that anonymous fax could be a part of somebody's
FUD campaign?

Servers in training -- Video servers are cutting their teeth
on training-on-demand applications, while waiting for the big
opportunities in consumer video-on-demand to appear

By:
Tam Harbert

After years of investing in video-server technology for elusive
consumer TV applications, computer OEMs are pinning their hopes
on the corporate LAN as the place to get some return on that
investment. The hot spot for servers today is in corporate
training-on-demand applications, but so far, vendors haven't
been able to gain much of a toehold.

Many OEMs are simply bundling their general-purpose servers
with video-networking software from third parties, in some
cases as a place holder until they've completed development
of new server software of their own. Some are developing hardware
as well. Redesigns are required, says Carl Lehmann, senior
research analyst at the Meta Group in Stamford, Conn., because
of the rigorous requirements of tomorrow's high-speed, multimedia
networks for isochronous data delivery in real-time.

"In my opinion, the big OEMs are groping," says Ed Delaney,
vice president of sales and marketing at Sea Change Technologies,
a small vendor of niche video servers based in Concord, Mass.
"They have invested a lot of money to develop these servers
for video-on-demand, and they are sitting there, trying to
figure out how to sell them." Based on proprietary chips and
buses, the servers are too expensive for the corporate market,
many observers believe.

Software bundling has emerged as an alternative to what Jim
Long, president of Starlight Networks Inc., calls "brute force
by hardware." Based in Mountain View, Calif., Starlight is
the market leader in video-server software. The company focuses
solely on the corporate enterprise market, producing client
server software and networking middleware that allow video
to be sent over local-area networks. Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM
Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. have all teamed up with Starlight
to deliver video on the LAN.

Long says the top applications for Starlight's products are
training and education, with training-on-demand a particularly
sweet spot. "Training is a line item in corporations today,"
says Long. "They have to find innovative ways of keeping people
up to date."

Indeed, U.S. corporations spent $50.6 billion in 1994 on training
for 47.3 million employees, roughly $1,070 per employee, according
to a survey conducted by Training Magazine. Training-on-demand
shaves those costs by eliminating the time and money spent
to send employees to off-site courses and to hire instructors.

Training-on-demand is interactive: a user can pull a video off
the network when he wants it, rather than having to watch it
when it's made available to him. Employees don't have to schedule
hours at a time for training away from their desks. They do
it at their convenience, right on the desktop. Moreover, studies
have shown that interactive multimedia training helps people
learn more effectively and retain more of what they've learned,
according to Starlight research. Studies have shown that return
on investment is as high as 400 percent.

Right now, OEMs must maintain at least two video-server strategies
 one for the corporate market and another for the consumer
market, says Dan Abouav, managing director of Hewlett-Packard's
Interactive Media Solutions Division, based in Cupertino, Calif.
"The requirements are different," he explains. "The number
of streams you have flowing from the server to the client is
different. But that will change over the next three to five
years. I believe that you're going to see solutions ranging
from the PC all the way up to tens of thousands of streams,
all basically using similar architectures."

In an alliance announced at Comdex/Fall for providing networked
video solutions on everything from PCs to Unix workstations,
HP and Starlight will sell preconfigured boxes through their
direct and indirect channels for corporate enterprise applications.
A new version of Starlight's NetWare-compatible video engine,
StarWare, will be bundled with HP's servers, delivering MPEG
1 video at 1.5 Mbits/s to as many as 100 simultaneous users
that is, if the server is wholly dedicated to managing multimedia.
The previous version could support only 10 concurrent users.
An HP NetServer preconfigured with StarWare, supporting 50
concurrent users and storing 20 hours of MPEG-1 video, will
cost about $28,000.

For its part, IBM is targeting training applications in the
corporate enterprise market by porting StarWorks, Starlight's
Unix solution, to its AIX platform for the RISC System/6000
server. StarWorks for AIX works in conjunction with IBM's Ultimedia
Services client software, says John Unthank, program manager
for AIX multimedia marketing in the RS/6000 Division, based
in Austin, Texas.

As for Sun, that company's Interactive Services Group, based
in Mountain View, announced a training-on-demand bundle last
October: a Sparcserver 20 preloaded with StarWorks for Sun's
Solaris operating system, along with MPEG-based video courseware
from vendors such as J3 Learning Corp., based in Minneapolis,
and ITC, based in Herndon, Va.

In a separate effort, Sun is also developing proprietary solutions,
such as the MediaCenter server, which incorporates home-brewed
software and some hardware tweaks. Based on standard Sun hardware,
the product is optimized for high-performance I/O and comes
with proprietary software that enables video to be treated
as a common data type in networks. The server runs only on
Fast Ethernet and Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks.

"We are trying to take Sun's basic hardware platform, add the
software expertise and a little bit of hardware in some cases,
and turn it into a video server," says Beverly Ulbrich, director
of marketing and business development at the group. Ulbrich
believes that MediaCenter technology will ultimately go into
both consumer TV and corporate LAN markets. Sun received design
guidance from its partners in the TV market, she adds, including
Thomson Multimedia SA, the Paris-based company that is working
with Sun on a digital interactive TV system using the OpenTV
operating environment.

Sun is also working with Siemens Stromberg-Carlson, based in
Boca Raton, Fla., and Scientific-Atlanta Inc., based in Georgia,
to deliver turnkey broadband interactive networks. Sun will
provide networking expertise and video servers for the alliance's
Interactive Multimedia Xpress architecture, while system integrator
Siemens contributes ATM technology and telecommunications systems,
and Scientific-Atlanta provides set-top boxes, cable systems
and processing equipment.

"The exact same products will go into those spaces [consumer
and corporate enterprise]," says Ulbrich, "although there may
be additional peripherals or software that we put together
to complete a solution for a specific application area." She
notes that the consumer and corporate products will be sold
through different channels.

Starlight dominates the market for video on corporate LANs today,
but it may not be able to hold that position for long. Third
party bundling strategies will undoubtedly conflict with new
solutions that emerge from Starlight's big OEM partners. In
addition, new, lower-cost video servers will arrive from lesser
known companies, such as the Network Connection, manufacturer
of a server called Cheetah with integrated hardware and software;
and Sea Change, which has carved out a 60 percent share of
the server market for commercial-advertisement insertion in
consumer video-on-demand.

Founded two years ago by Delaney and other former managers from
Digital Equipment Corp.'s Cable Television Unit, Sea Change
offers a low-cost server platform that could be easily adapted
to corporate or other markets, says Meta Group analyst Lehmann.
As for the Network Connection, the Alpharetta, Ga.-based company
already does 25 percent of its business in the corporate training
market.

But the real threat may come from video-server software being
developed by software powerhouses such as Microsoft Corp. and
Oracle Corp. "Those are the folks that could cause us trouble
down the road," Starlight's Long admits.

Not all server OEMs are enthusiastic about the corporate track
or training-on-demand. Some "just want to have video software
in their bag of tricks," says Long. But as the corporate market
takes on ever more importance, any OEM that plays the server
game will have to sit up and take notice.

Tech law: Loose Lips Can Sink Standards

By:
Richard H. Stern

Dell Computer Corp.'s recent run-in with the Federal Trade Commission
over the VESA Local Bus has rightly worried some OEMs about
the legal risks inherent in the increasingly informal process
of developing standards. Until now, companies have felt free
to get together and agree on interfaces and protocols for new
technologies without worrying about patent and antitrust issues.
They assumed they shared an understanding that no group member
would take advantage of the others by later enforcing patent
rights over some key aspect of the spec. They also assumed
nothing they were doing would violate antitrust or trade-regulation
laws. The Dell case may have shattered those assumptions. Dell's
representative to the Video Electronics Standards Association,
which promulgated VL-Bus, assured the group the Austin, Texas
based company had no patents on the technology he urged it
to incorporate. But Dell did have patents. And when it demanded
that other PC makers license them or face litigation, the FTC
stepped in.

Ultimately, the commission took the side of free information
exchange, requiring Dell to open up its VL-Bus patents to all
comers. On the heels of this debacle, VESA is trying to buttress
itself against a similar occurrence by having members sign
a conflict-of-interest statement. This agreement, which was
being revised at press time, states that all information exchanged
at VESA meetings is confidential, and that no participant shall
make intellectual-property claims on the basis of it. In this
VESA is emulating the good example of larger, formal standards
groups, such as the American National Standards Institute and
IEEE.

Many people in the computer industry consider formal groups,
with their burdensome bureaucracy and time-consuming legal
requirements, too slow to keep pace with today's markets. But
the Dell action showcases the legal risk developers run when
they exchange information outside the protection of a formal
standards body. Three members of an informal, ad hoc group
may take the resulting proposal to a formal standards group,
while a fourth stabs the other three in the back by taking
it to his patent lawyer.

Of the three remedies to this problem, only one is practical.
OEMs could draft broad technology cross-licensing agreements
with any companies they hold informal discussions with; but
many firms would be unwilling to sign. Equally unlikely, companies
could supply their engineers with blank intellectual-property
agreements, to whip out for a signature should they find themselves
in the midst of a standards discussion.

But there's a more realistic solution available. And it's a
simple one. OEMs should be extremely selective about the people
they discuss emerging standards with, remembering that in many
cases, the best advice is to zip your lips. If a serious standardization
effort is posed, a written agreement on intellectual-property
rights is an essential first step.

The big picture: Jigsaw-puzzle integration

By:
Ray Alderman

Today, computer companies must define themselves as either com
ponent suppliers or component in-tegrators, and many of the
old in-dustry leaders are trying to be both, pushing them into
an identity crisis. The largest computer makers on the planet
hit the wall in the early 1990s and are in the process of re
engineering themselves. For many years, Apple, Digital, IBM
and others designed, manufactured and integrated all the components
of a computer system in a seamless, vertically integrated model.
The advent of standards-based hardware, software and communications
destroyed this model in the mid-1980s, and these companies
haven't fully adapted to the new market realities yet.

What really happened was that Microsoft and Intel established
themselves as the component suppliers to the computer world,
in spite of what Apple, Digital, IBM and other industry stalwarts
tried to do; and OEM manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, Packard
Bell and others defined themselves as component integrators,
who could stitch hardware, software and communications components
into cost-effective products faster than the old school could
execute their vertically integrated product strategy. Consequently,
the old market leaders were "disintermediated," or bypassed,
in the value-added chain.

It's taken five years, but the old computer companies are learning
how to be component integrators, too, in order to compete by
the new market rules. But the rules have changed in the meantime,
with Intel redefining the role of the hardware-component provider
by selling motherboards to OEMs, rather than just chips.

The inherent problem with being a component integrator is differentiation
 Almost anyone can integrate standardized components into a
finished product. When the components are virtually the same,
the only differentiator is price. And since price is a function
of cost and cost is a function of volume, the ultimate differentiator
for a large component integrator is volume. For the smaller
component integrator, survival resides in specialization and
small niches.

But another change is on the horizon. It revolves around the
convergence of the television, telecommunications, teleconferencing
and entertainment markets. Will the delivery platform for these
services be the traditional computer or some new consumer product?
Intel's native-signal-processing initiative is its first defensive
act to keep the PC platform as the delivery mechanism for all
these new entertainment and communications services.

When component technologies are readily available, the only
decision the integrator needs to make about next-generation
computers is how they're packaged. Will it look more like a
PC or component-based stereo equipment?

Trade Association. He can be reached at exec@vita.com.

The PRET-A-PORTER PC -- (Ready-to-Wear Computing)

By:
Jacqueline Henry

A monitor that sits in a pair of glasses. A keyboard you wear
on your arm like a bracelet or a watch. A computer that clips
to your belt of slips inside your shoe. The vision of the far
future of personal computing steps outside today's gray boxes
to a brave new world where "personal" is personal indeed. In
this vision, computers become an extension of self, worn on
the body just like eyeglasses, jewelry and shoes--the ready
to-wear PC. Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren may not be showing
on yet, but Reebok is taking the idea seriously. The sneaker
company is sponsoring some of the research in wearable computing
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where a team
from MIT's Media Lab has cobbled together a prototype that
conjures up images of Maxwell Smart's oxford-shoe phone from
TV's "Get Smart," updated for the more casually clad '90s.
"The concept of power sneakers in intriguing," team member
Thomas Zimmerman wrote in his MIT master's thesis, Personal
Area Networks: Near-Field IntraBody Communication. "Shoes are
something that we always carry with us. For convenience, each
pair of our shoes could have their own [computer] insert."
In a high-tech twist on family values, Zimmerman suggests that
"at night when they are put in the closet, perhaps with our
spouse's and children's shoes, they could update each other
on the day's activities."

Though the power sneaker may sound farfetched, the wearable
computer has, in fact, been around for a while serving specialized
niches, such as the military and certain industrial sectors.
Though far from becoming a mass-market item-it's still too
bulky, expensive and power hungry-the pr t- -porter PC is making
strides toward the mainstream, thanks to advances in displays,
voice-recognition software and other enabling technologies.
Pioneering developers are weaving the fabric out of which tomorrow's
consumer wearables will be stitched, even as academics in places
such as the University of Oregon, Carnegie Mellon University
and MIT delve into ways to use the devices, once here, to their
fullest potential.

"I think that each of us will carry an information appliance,
as we [now] carry a pager or a cellular phone," says Zary Segall,
head of the computer-science department at the University of
Oregon. "We will be able to access information anyplace, anytime."

The MIT prototype is a step in that direction. It packs a CPU
and a pair of smart, battery-powered transceivers into an aluminum
case, measuring 3.76 x 4.8 x 1.48 inches, that slides into
a shoe like a Dr. Scholl's insole. It's far more than just
Mips and slippers, though: The system uses the human foot as
both a power source and a communications gateway.

"When you walk, you have all this power," explains Thad Starner,
a graduate student and researcher at the Media Lab, referring
to both body heat and movement as potential sources of energy.
"We're trying to recover some of that and use it to power your
computer." Starner estimates that of the 57-odd watts of energy
a person generates by simply walking, "we think we can recover
between 5 and 17 watts."

The Media Lab crew has demonstrated its prototype operating
as a node in a "personal-area network," which uses the human
body as the medium for computer-to-computer communications.
In such a linkup, two suitably soled human beings could, for
example, exchange electronic business cards merely by shaking
hands.

"When a woman and man [wearing these computers] are in close
proximity, particularly when they shake hands, an electric
circuit is completed, allowing a picoamp signal to pass from
the transmitter through her body to his body to the receiver,
and back through the earth ground," says MIT's Zimmerman. Once
the circuit is established, the transceiver in the woman's
shoe would send a string of ASCII characters to the receiver
in the man's shoe; his data likewise would take the footway
back to her.

"Wearable computers are going to change everything," Starner
proclaims. Baseball and football fans might wear one to a big
game or Super Bowl party, he suggests, calling up players'
stats and settling barroom bets on the spot. Reporters covering
a trial might load their wearables with pattern-recognition
software that helps them place names with faces, and then call
up biographical data on a subject before they go in for an
interview.

"We could eventually get to the point where you've got a cigarette
sized PC," says Scott Clark, business-development manager for
mobile information systems at Rockwell International Corp.'s
Collins Avionics & Communications Division, based in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa. "It will be inexpensive. It will be wireless.
And people will literally wear it around the house."

For this vision of the ubiquitous wearable PC to become a reality,
the computer must become more "human-literate," says Segall
of the University of Oregon. That means it must understand
not only speech, but gestures and eye movement and, on a more
advanced level, even "sense" what the user needs. For instance,
the wearable information appliance an airline maintenance worker
uses might automatically bring up a schematic of the specific
747 that has just landed and is taxiing down the runway.

"The challenge is how to come as close as possible to the understanding
of human behavior and how this translates into the commands
of an information appliance," Segall says. Then you find a
means of transmitting this data "in a way that enhances the
productivity of whatever the user is doing."

Neil Gershenfeld, an associate professor at MIT's Media Lab,
pushes the idea a quantum leap further. Ten years from now,
we will all be wearing computers, Gershenfeld said at an anniversary
bash for the lab last October. Twenty years from now, we will
implant the computing devices we want into our bodies. And
30 years from now, we will use genetic engineering to grow
the devices we desire. From this angle, "Intel Inside" takes
on a whole new meaning.

Shoe phones and implants aside, just what is a wearable PC?
Today it's most likely to be a belt-mounted computer powered
by a battery with a life of about four hours, along with a
heads-up display integrated into a headband, helmet, goggles
or eyeglasses, plus some type of input device-an arm-mounted
keyboard, for example, or a head-mounted microphone for voice
input. The addition of voice control is a must in some markets,
where users need hands-free operation to do their jobs effectively.

In terms of features, wearables have "everything that's in your
desktop PC," says Clark of Rockwell, which makes a version
called Trekker. "Today, it's a 486DX [CPU]; tomorrow, it will
be a Pentium. We're taking your desktop and shrinking it down."

Currently, companies such as Rockwell and Computer Products
& Services Inc. (CPSI), based in Fairfax, Va., are mining vertical
niches, producing wearable PCs for maintenance workers, firefighters,
overnight-delivery companies and other road warriors. This
market is expanding fast. For example, Symbol Technologies
Inc. sold around 5,000 of its first-generation Gladiator systems,
developed in 1992 for warehouse workers fulfilling orders for
a large pharmaceutical distributor. The Bohemia, N.Y.-based
company has just landed an order valued at $15 million from
United Parcel Service for "well into five digits" of its second
generation Gladiator II.

"We expect there will be a sizable market for wearable computers
in vertical industries, and by sizable we mean tens of thousands
of units a year," says marketing director Barry Issberner.

Today's wearables don't come cheap, and manufacturers are preoccupied
with driving down the price tag without stinting on features.
Rockwell's Trekker, for example, is priced at $13,000. It boasts
a tiny LCD screen-about 0.7 inch on the diagonal-coupled with
an optical system that makes the displayed image seem as though
it is on a 14-inch monitor positioned 18 inches from the viewer's
eyes. "That lens system was a major milestone," Clark says.
Without it, "people would get vertigo."

A high-end unit from CPSI-a Unix machine that weighs less than
three pounds and totes a 1-Gbyte hard drive and video acceleration
costs about the same. "People are not willing to pay an absolute
arm and a leg for these things," Clark says. "We continue to
drive prices down even though customers continue to demand
more in the unit. We're decreasing power, decreasing size,
decreasing weight and increasing performance."

Startup Phoenix Group, based in Plainview, N.Y., recently bowed
a computer not much bigger than a cigarette pack-3 x 6 x 1.3
inches-for just under $4,000. Designed to be worn in a shirt
pocket, the 12-ounce Hummingbird packs a 25-MHz 486SLC microprocessor,
170-Mbyte hard drive, 2 Mbytes of DRAM and voice recognition.
An arm-mounted keyboard is an optional accessory.

"We're working on an Air Force R&D contract to put the entire
computer in a headband," says Phoenix president Richard Pandolfi.
"We're using chip-on-board technology to reduce the size and
weight. It's the same technology used in many of our missile
systems."

Like many of the makers of wearable PCs, Phoenix initially targeted
military applications but is now seeking new niches in an age
of defense cutbacks. Rockwell's Space System Division, based
in Downey, Calif., is adapting the computer-simulation and
sensing technologies it developed for U.S. defense systems
into wearable gear for the public-safety sector, hoping to
equip police and firefighters with the latest in computing
fashions. The same predictive tools and computer-modeling programs
used to simulate a missile launch can track a moving fire front
and simulate how it will change in relation to wind, terrain
and time, the company says.

"We envision that every emergency person-whether [facing] fire,
flood or hurricane-will have such a computer on them to give
them access to higher levels of support and connect them with
all of the resources and predictive tools that we have in the
space business," says Chuck Daniher, program director for conversion
programs at Rockwell.

The utility industry is another potential market. Technicians
from the Long Island Lighting Co. (Lilco) are testing a system
jointly designed by Phoenix and defense contractor AIL Systems,
based in Deer Park, N.Y., for servicing customers' gas burners
and monitoring combustion-control systems at the company's
own power plant.

Instead of consulting thick manuals, explains Timothy J. Driscoll,
Lilco's director of R&D, the technicians access digital "hypermanuals"
on their heads-up displays, including diagrams and blueprints.
If they need a part, they can request it via a link to Lilco's
host system. Instead of scribbling data on a clipboard and
typing it into a computer back at the office, they can record
their notes by voice and download them while still in the field.

Besides size and power consumption, manufacturers have had to
overcome other technical hurdles to get wearables to where
they are today. The first challenge was reliable, rugged CPUs.
"This unit is bouncing on someone's hip while they're walking,"
says Clark of Rockwell's Trekker program. "The hard drive in
any desktop or laptop is not meant to be bumped around." That
problem was solved by using ruggedized casing and component
packaging technology developed for the military.

Voice recognition was also a challenge. "People don't realize
how far we've come with voice interfaces," says Edward Newman,
president of CPSI, which has been licensing voice-recognition
software from a third party but is developing its own technology.
"[These days] you train the system; you don't have to train
the user. The system adapts to the user. It's a combination
of independent speech with on-the-fly training."

Which is not to say voice systems are fully mature. "I still
think the speech technology has a way to go," says Segall at
the University of Oregon. "We need continuous-speech recognition
systems with a very high degree of accuracy and with a large
vocabulary." Displays need work too, says Segall, predicting
an evolution from direct-view screens to displays that project
information right onto the retina. "We need a type of display
technology which is amenable to humans," he says. "It's still
a ways out."

On another front, vendors are enthusiastic about wireless technology,
with Clark of Rockwell predicting that the headsets connecting
to belt-mounted units will soon be untethered. "The first step
is wireless from headset to CPU. The next stage-which is actually
available now-is a unit where you can pipe right into an existing
local-area network." Trekker, he notes, can handle wireless
LAN cards; "in the future, I see this expanding into wide-area
networks as well."

Tim O'Neal has embedded infrared links into the latest version
of the belt-worn printer his company-O'Neal Product Development
Inc., based in Irvine, Calif.-develops for mobile workers.
O'Neal says the InfraRed Data Association is just beginning
to promote IR for wearables after initially focusing on higher
volume targets, such as notebook computers. Though O'Neal has
only sold 10,000 wired printers to customers, such as Hertz,
in two and a half years in the market, he says business is
heating up for the wireless versions.

InterVision, based in Raleigh, N.C., is also exploring IR technology.
"We're working on a new version [of its wearable PC] that will
incorporate an infrared camera on the other side of the helmet,"
says president and founder Dan Glaser. "It doesn't block peripheral
or forward vision, so you can see where you're going while
at the same time displaying infrared images." These can guide
an emergency worker through smoke or at night. "We're also
incorporating a radio link so all images can be piped back
to a first-response team," says Glaser, who foresees many applications,
from bomb disposal to tele-medicine.

With vertical markets expanding nicely, developers can't be
faulted for looking longingly at the consumer side. But no
one expects to see a power sneaker of the MIT variety soon.
"I don't think anyone will be interested in wearable systems
for anything but industrial markets for some time," says Symbol
Technologies' Issberner. "PDA players like Apple and Hewlett
Packard are still trying to determine users' needs; they are
not even worried about making their products wearable yet."

Still, as some wearables, such as Phoenix's PDA-like Hummingbird,
press into the market from above, so do developers in the corporate
and consumer mainstream push from below. For instance, Motorola
has deemed its new palm-sized, 3.1-ounce Startac as a "wearable
cellular phone." In October 1994, Timex Corp. launched a kind
of wearable computer of its own-the Datalink watch, a Dick
Tracy-style gizmo touted as "a personal organizer on your wrist"
that can download information from a computer via a proprietary
protocol. The device got a big boost last August, when Microsoft
Corp. launched a version of its Scheduler Plus application
that bundled the Datalink protocol software.

Jan Mladek, who manages the Datalink group, says Timex had sold
about 100,000 of the watches as of August 1995. At $100 plus,
"it's quite a successful product for a new concept at that
price point," he says. However, Mladek acknowledges that there
are limits to what can be done in the form factor of a wristwatch;
the current product has the equivalent of just 1 kbyte of memory.

A 1-kbyte Timex at one end, a 1-Gbyte wearable Unix machine
at the other. And way out in the distance, perhaps, a strange
new horizon where biology and electronics begin to merge. Somewhere
in the midst of all this, observers say, lies an industry waiting
to be born.

The only thing to come between you and your Calvins? Someday,
perhaps, a computer.

Weight watchers for wearables

By:
Jacqueline Henry

Dieting is as much of an obsession for the wearable computer
as it is for your average supermodel. Symbol Technologies has
been slimming down for years. "Our first products [20 years
ago] used what were, in effect, car batteries on carts hooked
up to adding machines that people used in grocery stores,"
says marketing director Barry Issberner. "Over time, we turned
that into something you could hold in your hand."

In 1992 came the Gladiator, so called because its hand-, arm
 and belt-mounted components made users-warehouse employees
for a big pharmaceutical concern-look like electronic warriors.
Essentially a bar-code scanner with a 28-ounce computer, the
system "was fairly elaborate to wear, with three separate pieces
of equipment linked by six to 12 feet of cabling," says product
manager Robert Hurt.

In January, Symbol was expected to launch Gladiator II, a single
box, 9-ounce computer, powered, like its predecessor, by an
NEC V25 chip and priced at $2,200 and up. Replacing the bulky
hand scanner for bar-code inputting is a finger-mounted unit
that Symbol employees refer to as a "Liz Taylor ring."

InterVision has seen a similar evolution in its wearables. Now
on its sixth product generation, the company's first device
was a belt-mounted computer based on an Intel 286 processor,
with little internal memory, no expansion capabilities, a miniature
101-key keyboard that had to be held and a battery life of
only 30 minutes. The PC came in two boxes, each measuring 5
x 7 x 2 inches; a third box was added for voice activation.

Today's model, by contrast, weighs less than two pounds. It
comes in a single box, complete with voice activation, lots
of expansion capabilities and a 640 x 480 VGA flat-panel screen.
Weighing in at under 4 ounces, the display can be hooked to
a headband, hard hat or firefighter's helmet, enabling the
wearer to, say, bring up the plans of a burning building while
walking through it, determining where the exits are and whether
dangerous materials are present.

"Most people think about products in terms of pounds," says
Issberner. "We think in terms of half ounces."

A wearable skids off the runway

By:
Rick Boyd-Merritt

About four years ago, in a bid to raise its profile, a now-defunct
pioneer of portables launched what might have been the first
ready-to-wear computer. It was the brainchild of marketer Ken
Dulaney, looking for a compelling spin for Grid Computer's
new GridPad handheld PC.

"We couldn't make our computers any more rugged, so we came
up with the idea of putting a strap on them," says Dulaney,
now a research analyst at the Gartner Group Inc., based in
Stamford, Conn. "Then we designed a whole line of peripherals
radios and printers and so on-you could hook on a belt."

To promote this strap hanger, "we staged a press conference
at the Hotel Macklowe near the New York City garment district,"
Dulaney recalls. "We hired this gorgeous model who came walking
down the runway with this cape on. When she swung the cape
aside, there was this big, brown, three-pound computer on her
arm."

This early experiment fizzled, the wearable GridPad flopped
and the company was ultimately acquired by PC maker AST Research,
based in Irvine, Calif. Many Grid designers fled to developers
of vertical-market systems, such as Norand, Symbol and Telxon.
And those who recall that first wearable seem a little embarrassed
by it.

"It was all just hype to get some press," says Jeff Hawkins,
a former Grid designer. And when counseling clients for Gartner,
Dulaney tells them that wearables are solely for vertical markets.
"Other than pagers and cellphones, people don't want a lot
of bulk," he says.

The Interview: Carl Yankowski



As president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics
Inc., Carl J. Yankowski is, in effect, the head of Sony's diverse
hardware businesses in the United States that generate some
$8 billion in annual revenues. An MIT graduate with degrees
in both business and electrical engineering, Yankowski is himself
a product of convergence. He has worked at companies as diverse
as General Electric, Memorex, Polaroid, Pepsi and Procter &
Gamble, and bubbles with ideas about how to drive Sony into
the heart of new, cross-industry markets. We spoke with Yankowski
late last year in his booth off the bustling show floor at
Comdex/Fall, where Sony tipped its long-anticipated plans to
become a player in personal computers. The Park Ridge, N.J.
based company demonstrated prototypes of workstation-class
machines that use high-speed serial interfaces (1394) to tie
together a suite of digital audio and video services and devices,
thus playing PCs to Sony's home-court advantage.

How do you define the consumer PC?

A consumer PC would be something you would want to have in your
living room or family room. It would be an appliance that would
be inviting and fun to use. Hopefully, it would have one switch
to turn off the CPU and monitor simultaneously, which is something
we don't seem to be able to accomplish in the industrial design
of what's out there in the market today.

It's part of your stereo rack?

Exactly. The content and the hardware would be somehow bundled
together in a way that would make you feel this isn't just
a box that lets you do other things-this is a box that creates
new things for you to do in its own right. It's a link between
all the audio/video components and communications occurring
today in the home. It's kind of like a melting pot.

What are Sony's plans for getting into PCs?

The reason we want to get into the PC business is to learn how
to leverage our audio/video strengths into a PC line, which
will gradually cascade over a whole landscape of appliances
and products. So it's not [so much] that we are entering the
PC business as that we want to develop the landscape of where
communications, computer and audio/video equipment go. It's
a broader point of view than most of the people in this industry
are taking.

How does Intel fit into this vision?

We think Intel has a lot of interesting technology, not just
in their chips but in their Architecture Labs and their systems
skills. When you combine that with our strong A/V experience,
it just makes sense for us to be in business together.

Our relationship right now is simply a memorandum of understanding
that says we are going to develop exciting new products using
our technologies and their technologies, to be sold and marketed
by Sony under the Sony brand name and marketing channels. Anything
more specific than that we have yet to work out.

What will the Sony PC look like?

Exactly what we are working on is proprietary now. But you can
say that we want the Sony PC to have a unique look and feel.
We want it to be fun. We want it to have a positive impact
on changing people's lives, just the way the Walkman had a
positive impact. We're planning to launch the first products
in the fall [of 1996]

We think we are expert in combining different technologies from
different disciplines. The Walkman was not an invention, it
was a combination of products already on the shelf. We made
our existing headphone technology stereo, married it to our
business-dictation technology and got the Walkman.

What do you think about the so-called $500 PC?

I take issue with this fragmentation theory that is being spread
around that says the computer industry is going toward large
or small PCs or networked PCs or personal digital assistants.
There will be a whole landscape of products.

John Sculley said PDAs will predominate. Some people at Qualcomm
say that smart phones will predominate. People at Mtel will
tell you that ultimately two-way paging is going to be the
thing. I think it is wrong to say that PCs, or this little
surfer box, or the set-top box will predominate. I think it
will be a landscape of all these products living together.

I think there will be a market for $500 PCs, but I don't think
it will blow away other markets. It's [similar to how some]
people said PCs would eliminate paper, but paper usage actually
went up. It's too narrow and non-visionary to say some particular
device is going to be the savior across a broad category of
consumer applications. It never works out that way.

How will TV and PC products merge?

I think TV/PC products will go two ways for us. One, we will
look at interactive TV [as a means] to get to the Internet.
We are looking at set-top boxes in an arrangement with Microsoft.
And we think the 1394 [serial interface] will let us take digital
signals from direct-broadcast satellites [DBS] and bring them
to a computer, add value to them and pump them out to a whole
variety of devices [for video editing or storage]

It's not just the video side, but also the audio side. Our 100
CD audio changer is a good-news/bad-news machine. It's selling
great. You can put 100 audio CDs in one box and access any
title or song, but you have to sit down and program everything
in manually. It takes forever. So why not scan in the number
of tracks and their length and sequence when you load the CD?
Then [you can] automatically match that with a database lookup
table you downloaded from Compuserve or AOL, and you have all
the information about the content, the author, title, date,
background video clips-whatever you want.

You can do that in a nanosecond on the PC. So the PC becomes
a lubricant to make the A/V easier. You can also think about
the number of remote controls you have in your home today to
control components in an A/V system. You can simplify that
a lot by a digital line to the PC.

What effect will this vision have on Sony's structure?

We see a tremendous synergy here, and basically what we are
going to do is decompartmentalize Sony. Traditionally, because
of our strengths and roots, we were an A/V company, and No.
1 in A/V. We plan to remain so. But when you look at A/V, computers
and communications, the rich area is these crossovers, these
intersecting circles. This is a territory no one has put a
stake in. It is a high-margin, high-value-added, high-society
impact area. That's where we'll add value.

Is this philosophy borne out in how you are organizing your
PC design teams?

We are having the PCs designed by the one industrial design
center inside Sony.

What about the electronic design?

Right now in Japan, we are integrating [people from] the A/V
groups as well as the business information-systems group, which
has the most experience [inside Sony] in computers. We are
hand-picking the best people and putting them together to make
these PCs happen. We'll do some of the work in Japan and some
in the United States.

Are you really "decompartmentalizing Sony," or creating a new
compartment for PC products?

Both. You want to get people from different divisions to work
together. You want to have a focus within a division, and you
want to have [separate] A/V and communications and computer
divisions. But the richest [market] area is the crossover.

A month ago, I formed a telecom [group]. In that group I put
our wireless-telecom group, which is partners with Qualcomm
on CDMA [code-division multiple access]. With Qualcomm, we
comanufacture-and are finalizing a joint agreement on marketing
terminal sets to major systems suppliers. Our MagicLink [PDA]
division and home portable-phone groups were also put in that
sector. And we are moving engineers to the United States, because
the digital base of the home systems are overlapping even within
a sector. That's decompartmentalizing.

Then, in the beginning of [1996], I'm starting up a new business
development group [to oversee the] product-planning and priority
process, so we can develop crossover opportunities independent
of any given business group by assigning resources of different
groups to look at these opportunities. That's new for us. That
will also help us generate a whole new breed of innovative
general managers and engineers, because they are going to be
exposed to so many more tools for developing products.

I also want to create a new model for hardware/software systems,
and I'd like to do that in the PC business, too. I'd like to
create a model where the hardware guys get some percentage
of the downstream revenues of the system. This [should be]
a razors-and-blades model, [but] the equation is out of balance
right now.

Hasn't there, in fact, been debate within Sony as to whether
it's a hardware or software company?

Yes, and the answer is yes and yes. I don't think of myself
as running the hardware part of Sony.

But you do.

I do, but I don't think of myself that way.

How do you think of yourself?

I think of myself as coming at systems software and services
from a hardware angle and leveraging that. The old Sony is
basically a big A/V unit, a little computer unit extrapolated
basically from Trinitron [display] technology and a little
comms, mostly by partnership from the outside. Then we had
pictures, music and electronic-publishing centers. The interactivity
of these groups was not so great historically. Old Sony.

The new Sony is an A/V unit [plus] much expanded computer and
communications units. And I want to strike a tent peg in the
crossover areas. Our camcorders, for example, should have an
infrared link to our TV sets. Why not bypass the VCR?

What about software?

We have to have people in Sony Electronics who write software,
whether it's firmware device drivers or integration software.
Over the last two years, we've invested $7 million in our broadcast
division for programming capabilities. That's how we [built]
the Hughes DBS uplink station. It was a $50 million project,
and $20 million of it was code.

Also, we created a whole new concept when we took the hardware
side of A/V and the software side of content and made a Playstation
[videogame] division. It's not just content or A/V. I feel
ownership for it, and I'm supporting it with logistics and
distribution. Ultimately, it helps Sony [generate] profit.
That improves the overall ability for me to invest in new systems
concepts as well.

A third issue is distribution. We have to be savvy about different
forms of distribution into the home, such as DBS. We need partnerships
with telephony providers for [delivering] new features into
and out of the home.

Sony is one of several DBS licensees. With the growing competition,
will this still be a significant business for you?

Yes, we will sell several hundred thousand pieces this year.
As an industry, we risk making it too [much of a] commodity
too fast. It's my hope we can work with DirecTv to open up
[new service offerings]. For example, Sony has a gaming station
that we'd love to see on DirecTv because we could develop tie
ins on the hardware side. That's the kind of differentiation
we need, or else you have a bunch of people competing on a
commodity basis, and that's not good for the industry.

What impact will digital TV have on your plans?

As video becomes digital, we can manipulate the data and add
value to it in terms of new appliances and applications. I
think the Federal Communications Commission should mandate
a date by which the industry should have decoders available
in TV sets for a whole range of digital-broadcast schemes.
By that date, if the TV sets are ready, we should see applications
develop.

Is that likely to happen?

I don't think it's a likely scenario, but it would be neat if
it would happen. I think everyone would hope we can get there
voluntarily. I think [digital TV services] will start to be
turned on around the turn of the century.

What's on Sony's agenda in terms of standards for digital TV?

Our initial point of view is that we would like to see those
standards generated voluntarily. But right now, we are hoping
we can get some guidance from the FCC in terms of dates by
which to get those standards done. I think there's nothing
like the pressure of time and a commitment to force people
to work together. Before commenting on which standard is better
than others, I think we should just have a drop-dead date by
which the industry should say, "OK, all the technology is out
there, we know we can do it, the government says we have to
be ready by this date, so let's get going."

If you were FCC chairman Reed Hundt, what date would you set?

1998, January 1. I think something like that is doable.

Are you going to lobby the FCC to set such a date?

This is something we are going to bounce off the Electronic
Industries Association.

In hopes they take that position to the FCC?

Right.

What will bring back the PDA?

I don't think of it as a hardware business. I look at it as
applying a small, portable communications device to mostly
diagonal and vertical markets. I think we were a bit overzealous
initially as a team in saying that simply e-mail would sweepingly
change our lives. So we are still investing in this business.
And now we have a second generation of the [MagicLink] hardware.

Your PDA was designed as a horizontal consumer device. If you're
going to reposition it as a vertical-market device, would it
make sense to get out of your relationship with PDA software
developer General Magic Inc.?

That's always a possibility. But I think the Magic Cap OS still
has some unique advantages. We've found that people in some
vertical applications like the simplicity of the operating
system. For example, Visa is very interested in an electronic
wallet, and you want to have something easy to use. Or you
might want to have an application for betting on the state
lottery.

I do wish, frankly, that Telescript [General Magic's smart networking
software] was further developed in terms of its application
capability. I think it's in competition with [Sun Microsystems']
Java for that distinction. I was just talking to the guys at
Netscape today, and they said they wished there were more Telescript
applications.

We've radically improved our PDA hardware, and we are still
learning about the systems solution. We aren't investing that
much money [in General Magic], and the money we are investing
is valuable to me because the learning will apply to the PC
world, the A/V world, the telephone world. It's a generic investment
in a core competency for Sony. Ultimately, I think it will
blend nicely with our smart phones, too.

Where do you see the main wireless opportunities?

In the United States, we feel CDMA, and PCS extensions of CDMA,
are the major opportunities. But we also do business with McCaw
in TDMA [time-division multiple access]. Ultimately, there
will be a shakeout of some sort. But our strategy right now
is to keep a foot in each product and see where the market
goes. And we also have a partnership with Mtel to sell and
distribute their pagers.

I've been expecting to see Sony devices that would work with
its two-way paging network.

They're coming. That's part of the vision.

Is there a danger the smart phone or pager will be the PDA of
the telecom world?

We'll have to find that out. In any event, people will need
a terminal, and we are going to be experts in building good,
compact terminal sets.

PCs step into 3D -- The journey into the world of three-dimensional
computing will be a difficult one for PC makers, according
to the publisher of the PC Graphics Report

By:
Jon Peddie

PC designers preparing to take the plunge into three-dimensional
graphics would be well advised to stick to the shallow end
of the pool. The 3-D waters are treacherous for the uninitiated.
Developers can't even agree on exactly what features make up
3-D, nor come to any kind of consensus on 3-D architecture.
Moreover, the designation is not monolithic: Applications that
use 3-D vary greatly as to what sort of hardware acceleration
gives them the best boost for the buck. And yet, virtually
every vendor of 2-D graphics silicon and software, as well
as several untested startup chip companies, seem to be stampeding
into the 3-D arena. It's a sudden rush, not a careful and thoughtful
migration-never mind that the underlying graphics chips behind
many of these products have only recently been enhanced with
video capabilities. Three-dimensional technology is not really
new; 3-D has, in fact, been available in the PC market for
nearly a decade, with two companies leading the pack: Artist
Graphics, the St. Paul, Minn. based pioneer in graphics boards
for computer-aided design; and Matrox Graphics Inc., the Dorval,
Quebec, developer that was first to market with a consumer
level 3-D product. Until fairly recently, however, not much
software could take advantage of 3-D. With prices for 3-D boards
starting at around $5,000, sales have typically been in the
tens of thousands of units, and few software developers could
justify the investment required to support such niche devices
with their applications. The market was left to a handful of
companies which implemented their 3-D rendering completely
in software, often targeting scientific, engineering or other
niche markets and running on workstations.

Then, in the early 1990s, computer games grew more graphically
sophisticated, fueling a need for 3-D technology on the desktop.
The rise of a graphics-intensive game market spurred developers
to bring out several 3-D application programming interfaces
(APIs) for the PC. With the door open, traditional 3-D apps
such as scientific visualization, CAD, modeling and rendering
hopped on the PC 3-D bandwagon.

The growing momentum is bringing new applications to the fore,
including 3-D viewers and editors for the World Wide Web. Low
cost 3-D goggles are emerging for use with computer games.
And even virtual reality is beginning to sound less like a
virtual fantasy.

The pressure is forcing PC makers to pick a 3-D solution today
for systems they will offer next Christmas. These will need
to evolve gracefully into 1997, when an industry-standard 3
D approach may finally become clear. But while the market drivers
for 3-D are locked in fast-forward, the technical details of
executing a clean implementation on today's PC architecture
are stuck in slo-mo. The first problem is defining what, exactly,
3-D is.

The feature sets being offered in current and upcoming 3-D chips
are very diverse, and there is considerable controversy among
games developers, API suppliers, analysts and controller manufacturers
as to which should be required and which optional. Indeed,
when people bandy about the term "3-D" with respect to hardware,
they're often not talking about the same basic features. The
Direct3D API for Windows 95 that Microsoft is expected to ship
in April could become a major market accelerator, and definer,
of what 3-D is on the PC.

The pace of competition among chip makers is another factor.
If all the declared and undeclared chip makers enter the market
as forecast, the flood of product offerings could cause today's
average selling prices to plummet. As volumes rise, startup
and fabless chip providers could become non-starters if they
don't have manufacturing capacity lined up. There is no spare
fab capacity this year.

Generally, the top four features that make a chip 3-D are Z
buffering, color interpolation, texture mapping and rendering
of 3-D triangles and polygons. These basic tasks can be further
enhanced with various texture-mapping options and special rendering
features. Of course, some 3-D chips don't even offer all four
of the basics.

Z buffering is the baseline. A 2-D graphics frame buffer has
an X dimension and a Y dimension. In a 3-D world, some drawing
occurs in front of and behind the existing 2-D graphics via
a third, or Z, dimension that provides a (roughly) real-time
coordinate comparator for each pixel in the frame buffer. When
a 3-D object is drawn, each new pixel's Z value is compared
against the Z value of the previous pixel. If the values vary,
the new pixel is written from a Z buffer to the regular graphics
frame buffer.

The depth of the frame buffer determines how much 3-D accuracy
a given rendering will have and how much the Z coordinate must
be scaled to fit within the Z buffer. Typically, anything less
than a 16-bit Z buffer will produce unsatisfactory visual results,
but anything more is required only by high-end CAD and visualization
software. The Z buffer also needs significant bandwidth to
its internal memory if it is to support animation.

To create realistic lighting and shading of 3-D objects, color
interpolation is mandatory. In 2-D drawing, objects are flat
shaded, meaning that each object is a single color. Color interpolation,
also known as Gouraud shading, goes the next step, allowing
for a separate color at each vertex of an object. This provides
for more realistic lighting and on-the-fly shading of each
pixel.

A 3-D hardware accelerator doesn't do much without some kind
of 3-D building blocks, or primitives, to accelerate. The simplest
primitives are spans, which are horizontal sequences of 3-D
pixels. Some older 3-D devices only support spans, requiring
software packages to break down their polygons into these simple
units.

Beyond spans, the next step up is the triangle, then either
quads (polygons with four vertices) or tri-strips (triangle
strips). Most up-and-coming 3-D chips offer triangles. An exception
is the NV1 media-accelerator from startup NVidia Corp. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., which supports only quads.

After drawing Gouraud-shaded objects, the hardware's next task
is to apply a texture to a polygon. A texture can be a picture,
a background or a pattern-basically, anything that can be stored
digitally. Some of the more capable 3-D chips even support
a "texture" that consists of real-time digital video.

In a game such as Doom, all the walls, ceilings and floors are
texture mapped. The technique allows for the simulation of
a lot of detail in a scene without requiring lots of polygons.
For example, looking down an endless corridor would require
only four polygons-one for each wall, two more for the ceiling
and floor-assuming they all had the proper textures mapped
onto them. In the simplest form of texturing mapping, this
corridor would probably be rendered rather poorly. The illusion
of a corridor depends on perspective, but the texture would
be mapped orthogonally. That means faraway points-the most
distant bricks in a brick wall, say-would appear to be the
same size as those nearer the viewer.

To combat this problem, many texture mappers attempt some form
of texture scaling or reduction, leading to several methods
of making sure textures aren't significantly distorted by the
mapping process. The most basic is called mip-mapping (from
the Latin multium in parvo, or "many things in a small place"),
a technique that requires several versions of a texture, each
a different scale. The next step up is bilinear mapping, which
uses a blend of the texels (texture-map pixels) of two mip
maps when an match is available. Trilinear texture mapping
is more sophisticated, requiring three reads and one write
to load a pixel.

As if that weren't enough, some manufacturers add a couple more
texture-mapping features. The first is perspective correction,
which visually fixes the brick-wall-corridor mapping problem,
and is usually combined with bilinear or trilinear interpolation.
Also, some devices provide for "lit" texture mapping, allowing
parts of a texture to be brightened or dimmed as it's mapped,
based on theoretical light sources that may exist in a scene.

Every 3-D chip or software developer wants some kind of market
differentiator. Thus, under the umbrella of 3-D graphics come
a host of other advanced features, including visual effects
such as fog and stipple masks, as well as anti-aliasing. One
semiconductor company, S-MOS Systems, based in San Jose, Calif.,
even offers a chip that serves as a geometry processor, meaning
it can potentially offload the transformation, display list
and lighting calculations that software normally performs on
a computer's host processor.

Except in some early chips-such as the Glint controller from
3Dlabs Inc. of San Jose-these 3-D features aren't all typically
bundled in a single product. The trend is to package them with
an accelerated VGA graphics controller or, even better, an
accelerated VGA chip with video-processing features-the so
called video-graphics controller. Here, digital video can combine
with 2-D and 3-D graphics acceleration for maximum visual impact.
But some chip vendors, such as NVidia and another startup,
Chromatic Research Inc., of Mountain View, aren't content to
leave it at that. They also add high-quality sound capabilities
to their chips.

While pretty much all of the chips considered 3-D-capable offer
Z buffering, color interpolation and some form of polygon drawing,
not all of them offer texture mapping or the texture-mapping
extensions that will be required by upcoming 3-D applications.
Nor do they all offer backward compatibility to VGA acceleration.
However, the convergence of these functions will be found in
all of the survivors in this highly competitive market.

With some sense of the terrain of features, the next question
is how chip makers implement these functions. Clearly, 3-D
on a PC is different from 3-D on a workstation. The main difference
is the division of labor, commonly known as load balancing.

On a PC, the CPU typically handles all of the geometry-related
operations. The rendering functions-that is, making the pictures
look nice-are typically done by the 3-D controller. But not
all 3-D controllers do all the rendering functions; some leave
a number of these tasks to the CPU. There are trade-offs involved
in balancing the functional loads between particular CPUs and
particular 3-D chips. A chip that offers excellent video capabilities
may not offer the most advanced rendering functions, and vice
versa.

There are also a variety of ways for a controller to handle
3-D processes internally. The classic pipeline approach handles
one function in generating one scene after another. An approach
called forward rendering can deliver extremely high pixel rates
because it does not require some memory-read operations. Yet
another approach, ray casting, enables lighting effects that
closely model shadows and search lights in the real world.
Some chips construct scenes out of triangle primitives, others
use quadrilaterals and still others rely on tri- or quad-strips.
All of these approaches have advantages and drawbacks. They
all strive for a cost trade-offs in hardware, measured primarily
in memory usage and type of memory needed.

No 3-D traveler's baggage is complete without a strategy for
advanced memory technologies. For instance, some 3-D chip designs
do not use a Z buffer, while others claim to need 1 Mbyte.
Some use low-cost EDO (extended-data-out) DRAM, while others
use higher-performance memories, such as Rambus, video RAM,
window RAM and so on. The type and amount of memory have a
major impact on the cost of a total 3-D solution.

One major implementation issue among 3-D controllers is the
level of integration: of primary functions such as video control,
accelerated VGA, rendering and digital/analog conversion; and
ancillary functions such as audio and interfaces for graphics
oriented input devices such as joysticks, trackballs and the
like. Here, generally, more is less. Some solutions come in
three, four and, in one case, five chips-not counting memory.
Higher integration reduces board space, power draw and assembly,
which saves on costs.

Beyond feature sets and implementation strategies, designers
must consider their target applications. This isn't as straightforward
as it seems. Even though PC makers building in 3-D in 1996
are all doing it for gaming applications, there are several
distinct classes of games, and their demands on 3-D capabilities
vary considerably.

A fast-paced action game such as Doom does not need the highest
quality scene rendering, for example, but it does need fast
screen updates and a high frame rate. On the other hand, interactive
role-playing movies such as Silent Steel don't need any 3-D
rendering capabilities at all but do need the highest frame
rate and excellent video-handling features such as color conversion
and scaling. Further, adventure-mystery games such as 7th Guest
and Myst don't need either strong 3-D capability or high frame
rate, but they do need the greatest resolution and color range.

Chip designers are aware of this diversity and try to pack as
many of these functions as possible into their controllers
to accommodate the full gamut of apps. Meanwhile, developers
are innovating a whole new generation of games.

The 3-D controllers available today can roughly be grouped into
four categories: high-end, midrange, mainstream and low-end.
Examples of super-high-end implementations are the Glint chip
from 3Dlabs, which kick-started the 3-D processor craze; the
RSD/100 chip set that Lockheed-Martin tailored for arcade games;
the I128-2 from Number Nine Visual Technology of Lexington,
Mass.; and the SPC1500 from S-MOS. These tend to have the highest
performance, the most features and-at typically more than $70
the biggest price tags. They also tend to sport the largest
packages or use the most chips to create a design. However,
these are the chips that come closest to delivering real workstation
class 3-D performance. Often chips in this category will not
be VGA compatible or will offer only minimal VGA-boot capability.

A step down from these products is a class of 3-D controllers
in the midrange. These high-performance chips generally are
not totally integrated solutions and carry price tags higher
than what's appropriate for mainstream silicon. Among them
are the SST-1 from 3Dfx, a Mountain View startup; the Permedia
from 3Dlabs; the Mondello from Cirrus Logic Inc., the Fremont,
Calif., chip maker; and products from Artist Graphics, Brooktree
Corp. and Matrox. Like their high-end counterparts, these chips
are often not VGA compatible or have only minimal VGA boot
up capability.

The much sought-after sweet spot of the market is the mainstream
entertainment portion. To be a contender in this segment, a
chip should be a fully or nearly integrated 3-D video-graphics
controller. It should come in an inexpensive (i.e., plastic),
"normal"-size package and tote a price tag of less than $35.
Companies that are, say they are or think they are in this
category include ATI Technology Inc., based in Thornhill, Ontario,
Cirrus Logic, NVidia and Samsung Semiconductor Inc., based
in San Jose.

NEC and VideoLogic will debut mainstream 3-D controllers in
March. S3 Inc., based in Santa Clara, Calif., offers its Verge
chip for this category. Other players include startup Rendition,
based in Mountain View, with its Verite chip set, and Trident
Microsystems Inc., also based in Mountain View, with its T3
D9692. Matrox may push into this segment later this year.

A few chips offer some, but not all, of the functions required
in a 3-D controller. They include the T3-D2000 from Trident,
the ET6000 from Tseng Labs Inc. of Newtown, Pa., and the YGV611
612 from Yamaha, based in San Jose.

Whatever the category, most 3-D chips will ultimately converge
in the $20 to $30 price range and offer full texture mapping
and support for accelerated VGA and video graphics, with an
integrated LUT-DAC-lookup table/digital-to-analog converter
all in one device. Even as 3-D chip makers move toward such
products by integrating graphics features, graphics-chip makers
will converge on the same point by building in 3-D functions.

At the end of the day, the PC developer is left with a complex
matrix of the particular needs of particular games, which must
be matched up against the features and implementation styles
adopted by an increasingly wide range of 3-D controllers and
APIs. What's worse, there's no agreement among controller chip
vendors on how to measure performance other than by their own
particular test procedures.

By the end of 1997, all mainstream graphics chips will include
full 3-D acceleration, and 3-D hardware support will become
a standard feature of systems and add-in boards. Just what
specific features standard hardware acceleration will provide,
how vendors will implement them and which vendors will emerge
as the leading suppliers remain to be seen. The answers lie
along the crooked road that leads into the third dimension.

DVD -- Driving the Vidoe Disk

By:
Rebecca Day

Open just about any Business 101 textbook and you're sure to
read about Sony's Beta VCR format in some chapter on business
don'ts. The second and third editions might also touch on that
company's other big flop, recordable MiniDiscs, and perhaps
discuss the case of Apple Computer, which proved during the
1980's and '90s just how much market share you can lose with
a closed architecture. In the end, of course, the widely supported
VHS VCR format won consumers' hearts, minds and pocketbooks,
the compact disk became ubiquitous and IBM PC-compatibles sold
like semiconductors. The lesson: MultiFinder standards work.
This lesson has not been lost on the two rival camps scrambling
to bring to market a next-generation, high-density optical
disk that could, in one fell swoop, replace the laser disk,
videotape, CD-Rooms and audio CDs. Taking electronics history
to heart, Sony/Philips and Time Warner/Toshiba decided late
last year that instead of dividing the market, they will join
forces, creating a standard next-generation disk that will
play in any digital-videodisk (DVD) machine, whether it be
DVD-ROM, DVD video, DVD audio or DVD interactive. Moreover,
all these formats will be backward-compatible with previous
versions of the CD standard.

Such a DVD standard will surely fly-but how far, and how fast?
Will the nascent technology simply emerge as high-density replacement
products for the videotape, compact disk and CD-ROM? Or will
DVD realize its potential as a true point of convergence between
the personal-computer and consumer-electronics industries?

The consensus is that at least in its first iterations, DVD
is likely to appear as souped-up laser videos on the consumer
side and as capacious storage media on the computer end. Both
will offer significant improvements over mature media that
are bumping against technological ceilings. But beyond that,
all bets are off.

"Will computer companies learn how to design and sell the right
product?" asks Carl Stork, director of the Windows PC platform
team at Microsoft Corp., which is taking a wait-and-see stance
toward DVD. "Will consumer-electronics companies learn how
to play in the PC market? I don't know which is the harder
question."

Innovative software will be a key ingredient to fully exploit
DVD. "The DVD standard is a tool kit," says Robert van Eijk,
director of CD-recordable products at Philips Electronics,
the San Jose, Calif.-based arm of the Dutch consumer giant.
"The vehicle may be exciting, but we need to fill it with content
that's compelling to consumers."

Indeed, the opportunities afforded by the new high-density disk
are enormous: memory capacity of 4.7 Gbytes/side-enough for
133 minutes of movies on a side-plus variable-speed data transfer
at an average 4.69 Mbytes/second for image and sound, MPEG
2 digital video compression, multiple audio channels and a
file-management structure that's compatible with existing CD
ROM platforms.

On top of all that, disks cost 80 cents or so a pop, which makes
the aluminum platter "cheaper than a book," says Guy Johnson,
vice president of video-product management at Thomson Consumer
Electronics. "You can put lots of stuff on it, you can make
the medium cheap and you can still make money at it. You're
going to see a lot of people get into this as a way to get
information to customers."

Having pushed CD-ROM technology pretty much to its limits, the
PC industry is looking to DVD for a speed and density boost.
"DVD is going to be great for the computer world," says Alex
Daly, vice president of marketing at C-Cube Microsystems Inc.,
the San Jose-based maker of an MPEG-2/Dolby AC-3 audio/video
chip that will serve as the engine for DVD. "We've gone from
2x to 4x to 6x CD-ROM, and this becomes something like a 12x
CD-ROM, with 4 Gbytes or more capacity."

Technical specs, though, are "a little divorced from content,"
Daly warns. "You're going to see the same old content you use
today-Excel, Word, your organizer, whatever-sitting, perhaps,
on a DVD drive. Or maybe you go out and buy a more robust version
of Encarta [the Microsoft encyclopedia] on a DVD disk that
has more multimedia."

CD-ROM has maxed out after 10 years on the market, says Julie
Schwerin, president of InfoTech Inc., the Woodstock, Vt.-based
market-research firm. "When you start spinning a disk at speeds
six times faster than intended, you expose the disk to conditions
that require it to be manufactured to much higher tolerances.
If the disk physically performs near the limitations of the
spec, then the error rate goes up, requiring error-correction
circuitry to break in, which brings the disk speed back down
to 4x speed. DVD is just a bigger CD-ROM," Schwerin says. "And
that's good, because it means the DVD technology will have
a long life."

Consumer-electronics manufacturers, for their part, see DVD
as a magnet to pull consumers into audio/video stores. "What's
driving the consumer-electronics business right now is home
theater," says Craig Eggers, marketing manager for new products
at Toshiba America Electronics Corp., based in San Jose. "And
what home theater is about is reproducing the director's vision
as faithfully as possible. DVD comes as close to that as any
other product ever introduced. DVD is the ultimate home-theater
machine," he exults.

The advantages of the new high-density medium are easily measurable
for the consumer. Full-length movies can squeeze onto a CD
size disk along with five full-bandwidth channels of audio
in several languages and with subtitles. Digital video enables
both random access of scenes, which isn't feasible with sequential
access videotape, and the placement of supplemental information
on a disk, which isn't possible with the outdated laser disk.

Further, DVD's MPEG-2 video compression makes room for both
the 4:3 aspect-ratio pan-and-scan formats used by the current
NTSC broadcast system and the wide-screen formats that more
closely approximate the cinematic experience of a movie theater.
"The audio used in DVD comes as close to the best theaters
you've been in, and the video quality is capable of being as
good as the D-1 masters that all software is sourced from,"
Eggers says.

It all sounds great, but will consumers bite? And at what price?
Most suppliers can't afford to be anything but optimistic.
CD growth has slowed, VCR diffusion has topped out and the
laser disk is a 15-year-old format that has failed to excite
more than about 2 million video enthusiasts.

Eggers points to a $200 million multivendor awareness campaign
that will put the letters "DVD" in front of consumers' eyes
countless times before any product even ships to stores late
this year. A subsequent $200 million campaign will follow.
Time Warner vows that at least 250 software titles will be
available at DVD's launch, and RCA Corp. has boldly promised
to deliver mainstream-priced $500 players to stores by fall.
RCA predicts that DVD will post first-year sales figures rivaling
those of the company's Digital Satellite System (DSS)

Schwerin of InfoTech, on the other hand, believes market adoption
will be driven by the PC side. She predicts that worldwide
sales of DVD-ROM players will top 2 million units in 1997,
outpacing DVD movie players by two to one. As a movie medium,
"DVD faces the additional challenge of carving out a new place
in the home-entertainment center with consumers who have heretofore
strongly favored recordable VCRs over superior-quality analog
laser videodisk," Schwerin says. InfoTech sees the DVD-ROM
as the favored upgrade for PC-hardware manufacturers beyond
6x CD-ROM drives, thanks largely to greater density and more
efficient channel modulation.

Johnson at Thomson Consumer Electronics, the Indianapolis-based
parent of consumer giants RCA and General Electric, also expects
recordable DVD-ROM products to hit the market in 1997, ahead
of consumer DVD. Movie versions, he predicts, will be held
up, partly on account of resistance from Hollywood, which fears
pirating of recordable digital titles.

Johnson says the recordable DVD for computer applications will
have 2.6 Gbytes of memory, compared with the 4.7 Gbytes required
for a movie disk. "People will use recordable DVD for all kinds
of things they use recordable disks for now: CD-E[rasable]
or CD-R[ecordable]," he says. "This will replace all those
formats."

But simply replacing the CD-ROM and the VCR with beefier machines
may not hold much promise for the mainstream market. In fact,
some say that such a minimalist approach to DVD would demonstrate
both a waste of immense technological resources and a lack
of creativity on the part of the converging industries.

Rather, the key to DVD's scoring a big success is novel applications,
says van Eijk of Philips Electronics. "Just generating a high
density format for the sake of more capacity doesn't do much."
The burden falls to content providers, says van Eijk, who expects
DVD content to evolve the same way CD-ROM content did.

"In the early days of CD-ROM, content providers took existing
material like databases and transported it to CD," he says.
"But what was the compelling reason for consumers to switch?"
It was only when the CD-ROM imported motion, graphics and video
that it became exciting, van Eijk contends. Finally, more creative
implementations, such as hypertext and hyperlink, took CD-ROM
where consumers had never been before, integrating features
that took full advantage of the new format.

Many would like to likewise push the DVD envelope to its creative
limits. Rather than using it to, say, add more video and sound
clips to an existing product-for example, Microsoft's Cinemania,
a CD-ROM about movies and movie history-van Eijk pictures a
DVD movie disk that includes movie reviews and advertising.
With such a disk, consumers might have to sit through a trailer
before being able to access a review. "It's a horrible thing
to say," he adds, "likening a DVD-ROM to a commercial."

Van Eijk also sees great opportunity for user participation
in a movie DVD. "It's a very interesting idea to combine movies
with games," he says. "You could put, say, a Terminator 2 game
on the same disk as the movie or its soundtrack." That kind
of scheme could enhance revenues for movie-rental stores, he
says, winning converts at your local Blockbuster. "You might
have to unlock the game with a code, for which users would
somehow be charged."

Thomson's Johnson also sees great commercial possibilities in
DVD. He envisions content-related shopping on a disk, with
viewers, for example, punching in a code to buy a leather jacket
from a catalogue that resides on the same disk as a Clint Eastwood
movie. "Or you may take that disk and put it on your computer
and do the shopping from the computer," he speculates. "You
could also have a travel-destination disk for $1 or $2. Where
you want to watch that disk I don't know. The office? The couch?
It will play in our players and TV/DVD combination units, and
on somebody else's game machine. The way people perceive what's
going to be on a disk today is going to be much different than
what this disk has the potential to be."

The issue of whether DVD will be driven by the computer or the
consumer-electronics industry may be a moot point as suppliers
in each industry edge closer to the other side. Products like
Toshiba's TIMM, a multimedia TV and PC monitor, and the PC
world's plug-and-play initiative indicate rapid and inevitable
convergence.

Last fall, Thomson showed a prototype of a 35-inch TV with SVGA
resolution called Genius Theatre, described as a home-theater
system with the entertainment features of a PC-complete with
a wireless keyboard, a full array of surround-sound electronics
and speakers, and a six-disk CD-ROM changer. With the TV serving
as a gateway to the Internet, Johnson says, a DVD would be
a great host for a Web browser. He notes that much of what
comes off the Internet is not real-time information, so it
could easily be downloaded onto some sort of recordable DVD
for access later.

Downloading of information from Net to disk won't happen in
a vacuum, of course. The pipeline into the home will have to
widen in order to move the vast amount of data required for
high-quality video and audio information. Daly of C-Cube Microsystems
sees the cable modem as the enabler here. The last thing a
consumer wants is yet another box near the entertainment center,
Daly says. Instead, he foresees a combination set-top box that
bundles audio, Web browser, video-compression decoding and
modem.

"By 1997, you're going to start seeing multifunction platforms
emerge," Daly says. "You'll be able to play back a DVD, receive
a DSS signal and even surf the Net. You have to do MPEG for
a set-top box to receive digital cable or satellite signals
and for a DVD movie player. It would be more efficient to use
a single component at the center of that and create the periphery
around it."

As hardware designers tout DVD's vast capabilities, the software
industry is sniffing around the technology as well. Stork at
Microsoft says it's too early to make firm commitments about
DVD. "When CD-ROM drives first came out, they were more than
$1,000," Stork recalls. "It took about six years until any
significant amount of CD-ROM software became available. If
these [DVD] drives are inexpensive early, it will go to market
more quickly and encourage more titles more quickly." But if
drives are high-priced, the software will serve more specialized
markets, Stork predicts.

"Early on, CD-ROMs were only used for reference materials and
specialized applications," he says. "It wasn't until drive
prices got into the couple-of-hundred-dollar range that their
consumer usage flourished. I would expect to see a similar
kind of development here."

Ultimately, Stork believes DVD invites a new kind of player
into the home. "I think there's a new product opportunity here
that doesn't exist today but could in two to three years,"
he says. Such a player would have a display about 30 inches
or larger for movies, the processing power of a PC for games
and a TV tuner. "It could be the device you want in your family
room that you use to watch broadcast TV or play videogames
and watch DVDs," Stork says. "You may not do much computing
in the sense that we do computing on PCs today at all; you
may just be using it as an entertainment device."

Will this convergence product come from the computer world,
the consumer-electronics world-neither of which has much experience
in the other's domain-or a new industry altogether? Or perhaps
a single convergence product isn't necessary at all. Consumers
might want several DVD machines, in different flavors: one
for the office, for example, one for the family room and a
portable model for everywhere else.

"In the Far East, a lot is being done with convergence products
around CD-ROM," says Philips's van Eijk. "But in the United
States, we tend to buy multiple versions of the same thing.
In reality, people buy three or four CD players for different
purposes. [In that sense,] I don't believe DVD will be a convergence
product."

Computer and consumer companies have shaken hands and now they're
all heading for their own corners. The battle for consumers'
dollars has begun. But while vendors grapple with product issues,
there are still a number of real-world questions that need
to be answered.

"How do we package this, how do we describe this, how do we
sell this, how do we get people to buy this?" asks Microsoft's
Stork. "These questions are probably as hard as the technical
issues. It's a product nobody's asking for. Can [marketers]
come up with something that's compelling? To us guys that build
product, we think they ought to be able to, but they've got
a job to do."

Will Hollywood back DVD as a censor?

By:
Rebecca Day

The final specs for the videodisk and PC-ROM versions of DVD
were barely dry when Miami-based startup Nissim Corp. announced
the first potential application for the fledgling technology.
In an early-December press release, CEO Max Abecassis said
Nissim will build into its DVD players a "variable-content"
capability that includes a motion-picture rating technology.
Called Control, the feature will enable viewers to screen the
content of the video, blocking children from viewing violent
or sexual content.

Hardware suppliers have touted parental-control capability as
a selling point for DVD as a movie system. With Nissim's version,
viewers could select a rating, such as PG-13, and program the
player to skip scenes deemed beyond that level. Each disk would
have to be encoded with the appropriate information, and Hollywood
had not commented on the system at press time. Abecassis is
hoping public pressure will persuade the studios to consider
it. "I'm hoping to inform the public about the technology,"
he says, "and through their reaction, elicit greater support
than I would ordinarily get from studios."

The Control software, which requires about 100 kbytes of memory,
is the first to look at a movie as a "videobase" of individually
addressable segments, Abecassis says. The exact digital location
of every segment in a DVD is identified and assigned a content
category and level of explicitness. The resulting data, referred
to as a "variable content map," sends information to the player
that can be used to automatically generate a playlist of only
acceptable segments. "The essence of a DVD is random access,"
Abecassis says, "and this system exploits that capability like
no other technology available."

The concept would be one way for Hollywood to police itself,
thereby staving off attempts at censorship by government or
parental groups. At the same time, however, it gives users
control over a film's creative content, which is sure to draw
resistance from the artistic community.

"Say you took out 'Schindler's List' on DVD and wanted to watch
a PG version of it," says Guy Johnson, vice president of video
product management at Thomson Consumer Electronics. "Steven
Spielberg's going to say, 'B.S. You're not going to take out
my scenes that I've worked on and mess with my creative content.'
Hollywood has to go through some refining of how they're going
to handle this issue. I know for sure that a lot of directors
aren't going to want you to decide the rating level of a disk."

Wireless LANs -- Not of this World

By:
Barry Phillips

Just two years ago, companies selling wireless local-area networks
were ready to shoot the moon. Advocates predicted broad deployment
of untethered links in the corporate world by the end of the
decade. Their evidence: a nearly ready IEEE standard and a
wealth of new products any MIS Manager might find compelling
for the office of tomorrow. But today, it looks as though wireless
LAN technology might be lost in space. The IEEE's 802.11 standard
is still "nearly ready." Insiders say it could take until the
end of 1996 to fully nail it down. And though later this year
vendors expect to sell wireless PC-card LANs that poke along
at 1 or 2 Mbits/second for, perhaps, $350, desktop PC cards
for 100-Mbit/s wired LANs have already dropped to $170. Which
option do you think that forward-thinking MIS managers will
choose? "It's not a very compelling business proposition to
say we may be more expensive, but we're slower," quips Mack
Sullivan, director of marketing communications at Mountain
View, Calif.-based Proxim Inc., a supplier of wireless-LAN
chips and boards.

Apparently sensing a lost cause, National Semiconductor Corp.
disbanded its wireless-LAN semiconductor efforts in early 1994.
Motorola Inc. curtailed its high-profile push into wireless
LANs last September, when its licensed 26-GHz Altair system
died a quiet death after failing to generate much heat in the
marketplace. And startup companies pursuing breakthrough 10
 and 20-Mbit/s wireless LANs have met with less-than-stellar
results so far.

Instead of the broad deployment advocates predicted, wireless
LANs are making their greatest inroads in niche applications
in the factory, medical center and warehouse. In car-rental
return, inventory-management and point-of-sale niches, for
example, users have an overriding need for cordless data connectivity
and are willing to pay a premium for it.

"The biggest opportunity for us is where desktops don't exist
today, and there is a need for handheld systems," says Alan
Soucy, vice president of personal systems for Zenith Data Systems
(ZDS). That's a switch. When the Buffalo Grove, Ill.-based
company launched its CruisePad handheld terminal in June 1994,
Soucy was targeting "corridor cruisers," executives who spend
time away from their desks and who would presumably welcome
wireless terminals for tapping into the corporate LAN. CruisePad
gives roving users a window into their desktops via a built
in wireless-LAN module, co-designed with Proxim, that uses
2.4-GHz spread-spectrum technology.

But by and large, those nomadic execs failed to bite. Soucy
claims that today, "a few thousand" CruisePads are in use,
mainly beta units linking to Windows NT servers via redesigned
software. "In the corporate market, there has been a significant
investment in the current [wired] infrastructure, and a lot
of offices have performance-related requirements that are hard
to break out of," he says. Soucy now tags vertical markets
in hospital and industrial settings as the prime arenas for
CruisePad sales.

"If we are looking at replacing wired LANs in offices, that's
just not going to happen," concurs Todd Smith, director of
product marketing for Aironet Wireless Communications, based
in Fairlawn, Ohio. "We [at Aironet] don't walk around the office
carrying this stuff-and if we don't do it, who will?" Nor does
Smith see wireless LANs becoming more attractive to the corporate
mainstream any time soon. "Expenses for installing a wireless
LAN are front loaded," he says. "To get the first guy on-line,
it's going to cost a lot of money for the coverage you need.
Wireless LANs won't be a replacement, but a way to augment
wired LANs in places where that makes sense. So for the next
couple of years, the business will all be in vertical [markets]."

NICE NICHES

That assessment is quantified by Andy Prophet at AP Research,
a Cupertino, Calif.-based firm that tracks the PCMCIA market.
"The current market for wireless LANs is just under 1 million
PC cards in 1996, growing to 2.4 million cards by 1999," Prophet
says. "Most of today's applications are in vertical markets,
and I expect it to remain that way."

But small niches can spell big sales, and companies like Aironet
are thriving in vertical markets. Smith claims that since its
inception in 1991, his company has sold 300,000 radios for
wireless LANs. A third of them went out the door in the last
12 months, the vast majority to parent company Telxon Corp.,
based in Rosemont, Ill., which makes scanners and ruggedized
computers for vertical markets.

Proxim's business, too, is heavily skewed to selling OEM modules
to some 50 companies-such as Fujitsu Personal Systems Inc.,
based in Santa Clara, Calif.-that integrate the parts into
vertical solutions. Fujitsu is selling a wireless-ready 486
based portable called Stylistic 500 RF, which runs Microsoft's
Windows for Pen Computing.

Even though niches can be lucrative, many OEMs are still trying
to find a way into the mainstream corporate market, with its
promise of big bucks and long product life. According to BIS
Strategic Decisions, a market-research firm based in Norwell,
Mass., there are 15.2 million in-building travelers-the corridor
cruisers ZDS originally targeted-who could benefit from mobile
access to their corporate LANs. And yet, wireless-LAN sales
to the horizontal office segment are well under $100 million,
says Joe Baylock, an analyst at the Gartner Group Inc., based
in Stamford, Conn.

To broaden product appeal and tap into the corporate wellspring,
OEMs are scrambling to improve the price, performance and standards
picture for wireless LANs. Niche users typically pick a single
vendor's solution from the hodgepodge of proprietary, incompatible
systems operating within the 902-to-928-MHz industrial, scientific
and medical (ISM) band. In the office, by contrast, interoperability
of equipment is a paramount concern, and the dearth of wireless
LAN standards is an issue for both information-service managers
and end users.

To get into their servers, clients on a corporate enterprise
network need integration with existing Internet Protocol-based
networks and applications. They also want support for ad hoc
networking, which enables them to interconnect on a peer-to
peer basis. But the wireless-LAN industry has plodded along
for years with no standards for media-access control (MAC)
and physical-layer (PHY) interfaces.

Pending IEEE 802.11 standards for 2.4-GHz wireless LANs are
the key to broader deployment, observers say. That's because
many national and regional regulators-the Federal Communications
Commission and its counterparts around the world-have reserved
the 2.4-GHz frequency band for unlicensed use by wireless LANs.
Most wireless-LAN radio development has therefore shifted up
band from 900 MHz, the frequency used in earlier product generations.

The 802.11 committee hopes to complete its work in mid-1996,
but trudging the final mile to formal approval may take until
the end of the year. Whenever it's finalized, the standard
will help bring wireless LANs into the mainstream by reassuring
users that the technology is solid.

"The main thing the standard does is put a floor under the technology,"
says Craig Mathias, a principal at the Farpoint Group, a research
and product-consulting firm based in Ashland, Mass. "End users
won't necessarily buy wireless LANs because of the features
in the standard, namely interoperability, which I have some
doubts about," he says. "[But the standard] legitimizes the
technology."

Unfortunately for end users, however, the 802.11 standard will
institutionalize two incompatible radio-modulation schemes
that will be left to compete head on. In effect, customers
will choose between two types of "wire" for their mobile data
networks: direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) and frequency
hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS)

Though both systems offer bandwidth between 1 and 2 Mbits/s,
the DSSS camp-headed up by AT&T, maker of the WaveLAN product,
and radio-circuit supplier Harris Semiconductor-claims direct
sequence technology will have an easier time than FHSS taking
wireless LANs to higher speeds. Direct sequencing spreads the
signal by combining high-bit-rate, pseudo-random code with
the data being sent; several channels, all with their own pseudo
random code, share the spectrum.

With frequency-hopping technology, by contrast, discrete blocks
of data go out on a large number of frequencies. The radio
transmits bursts of information, and the receiver follows the
same sequence of hops to recover it. The FHSS camp comprises
the bulk of the wireless-LAN industry, including leading OEMs
such as Proxim and Xircom.

"We expect to see a shakeout in terms of the radio [approaches],"
says Roland Fournier, product-marketing engineer at Advanced
Micro Devices Inc., based in Sunnyvale, Calif. "There will
probably be one standard radio in a year."

The technical debate resembles the situation in digital cellular
and personal communications systems, where the industry is
split between two high-frequency radio-access methods: code
division multiple access and time-division multiple access.
There, the public network carrier makes the technology decision
for an entire geographical region; but with wireless LANs,
users must confront the dilemma themselves when they choose
which radio to buy. Not only are the two types incompatible,
but they interfere with each other, knocking out the other's
signals. Industry watchers say that placing a technology decision
on consumers' shoulders will confuse buyers and impede market
growth.

Meanwhile, uncertainty about the finality of the 802.11 standard
has chip and card vendors hedging their bets. Chip maker AMD,
for example, has opted to implement its MAC controller based
on a programmable part: the 80188 microcontroller. The resulting
PCnet-Mobile MAC controller can support FHSS, DSSS or infrared
interfaces. "If 802.11 got pushed out for any reason, we wouldn't
have to spin new silicon," says Fournier. "PCnet-Mobile can
be reprogrammed to reflect any changes."

For its part, Proxim hopes to challenge an expected rush of
initial standards-compliant products running at the 1-Mbit
s IEEE spec with a proprietary 1.6-Mbit/s product. "We think
[standards-based products] could be dead on arrival," Sullivan
says. "The 802.11 group is basically building a product by
committee. How many compromises have the 15 vendors on the
committee made along the way?"

"Within the 802.11 standard, there are a lot of options," says
Baylock of the Gartner Group. "This is a key time for the formation
of coalitions among OEMs. Certain groups of vendors will choose
to work together and select a subset among those options that
they all can build to. We'll see implementation agreements
within the 802.11 framework."

Fournier of AMD predicts that updatable 802.11 network-interface
cards will emerge in mid-1996, much as updatable V.34 modems
appeared before that standard was formally ratified. Designers
will need to add flash memory, at a cost of about $10 per card,
until the standard finally solidifies.

So far, one manufacturer of 2.4-GHz transceivers for the wireless
LAN market has bought into AMD's chip solution. Pulse Engineering
Inc., based in San Diego, plans to introduce a complete FHSS
based PC card that will sell in OEM quantities for $169. AMD
is also supplying drop-in MAC silicon that works with the new
Prism chip set from Harris, based in Palm Bay, Fla., a highly
integrated four-chip RF subsystem for wireless-LAN DSSS radio.

Prism is the first off-the-shelf DSSS radio solution aimed at
low-power Type II PC-card designs. A design still requires
two external gallium-arsenide power-amplifier ICs to drive
an antenna, but Harris is working to integrate these functions
into silicon to further reduce power consumption. Besides mopping
up more than a dozen ICs, the DSSS radio operates at up to
4 Mbits/s-twice the rate of the fastest 802.11 mode.

Samsung has adopted the Prism chip set as the basis of a 3-V,
2-Mbit/s Type-II PC card for mobile computers announced late
last year. Aironet has also said it will use Prism for its
next-generation wireless-LAN products.

The availability of standard, off-the-shelf MAC silicon-expected
from multiple vendors in 1997-will have a beneficial impact
on the cost, complexity and time-to-market of wireless-LAN
products. However, having two different radio standards makes
it harder for the industry to consolidate behind a single PC
card design or access-point architecture. Once a single radio
standard does shake out, perhaps by 1998, the market may expand.
As volumes increase, AMD predicts that the combined cost of
a wireless-LAN card and a port on a wireless access point will
drop from $330 in 1996 to $250 in 1998. By then, of course,
a 100-Mbit/s Ethernet card could dip to below $100.

The access point itself could become a fertile area for OEMs
to differentiate and add value, says Bruce Sanguinetti, executive
vice president of sales at BreezeCom Wireless Communications
Inc., based in Carlsbad, Calif. He predicts that access points
the bridge to the wired network-will keep getting smarter,
improving wireless-LAN functionality.

BreezeCom's access points, based on a multicell wireless switching
configuration, support up to five users operating at 3 Mbits
s, or a total of 15-Mbits/s of aggregate bandwidth. The company
(formerly called Lannair) is sufficiently convinced of the
stability of the 802.11 standard to already market wireless
adapters and access points as 802.11 D2-compatible.

BreezeCom is not the only wireless vendor to have ventured beyond
the standard's 2-Mbit/s frontier. But the battle for bandwidth
is not without its casualties. One high-profile startup, RadioLAN
Inc. of San Jose, Calif., failed to hit a promised ship date
last September for a 10-Mbit/s wireless LAN, despite having
won some big venture-capital bucks and a best-of-show award
at Interop in the spring of 1995. A second startup, WiLAN,
has been aiming at an even loftier goal: 20 Mbits/s; but the
Canadian company has shipped nothing to date.

The IEEE itself is talking about a 10-Mbit/s 802.11 follow-on,
and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute is
working on a 20-Mbit/s version, HiperLAN. Whether such standards
efforts or a startup's proprietary push will make the bandwidth
breakthrough for wireless LANs is still anybody's call. "Our
goal is to get to 10 Mbits/s, but we don't know how long it's
going to take," says Smith of Aironet.

According to Dave Bagby, a lead design engineer with AMD who
sits on the IEEE 802.11 committee, the 1- to 2-Mbit/s speed
limit on most of today's wireless LANs is a result of the limited
bandwidth allocated by the FCC for unlicensed use. "The current
802.11 PHYs had to account for FCC regulatory restrictions
in their design," he says. "If they allocate more spectrum,
you could get a different answer. The issue is political, not
technical."

Several vendors who tinkered with wireless LANs in the 5-GHz
spectrum managed to attain data rates of 5 to 10 Mbits/s. Yet
FCC power-output restrictions limited their usefulness, and
most of the high-frequency projects were abandoned. According
to Michael Rothenberg, president of BreezeCom, the industry
is organizing to lobby for expanded spectrum allocations in
the 5-GHz range for unlicensed LAN operation. Widening the
frequency slots currently assigned in the 5-GHz range from
1 to 5 MHz is seen as the key to the next bandwidth breakthrough.

In the meantime, some vendors are focusing on bringing audio
and video applications to wireless LANs. While many argue that
multimedia support is an issue of raw data pipe size, special
protocol options in IEEE 802.11 enable wireless-LANs to reserve
bandwidth and set up circuit-style connections for the guaranteed
bandwidth multimedia traffic needs.

"The standard attempts to support time-bounded services," both
data and voice, says AMD's Bagby. "To this end, there is a
fair amount of complexity involved with the portion of the
draft that handles what we call the point-control function."
Digital Ocean, an OEM working in conjunction with AT&T, is
developing a wireless access point that implements point control,
a function that can allocate bandwidth to support mobile multimedia
transport applications. But given the status of wireless LANs
in general, the idea of an untethered multimedia link may be
a bit over the moon.

Infrared aims for the corporate LAN



Infrared (IR) data transmission may be moving beyond its niche
as a point-and-shoot medium for moving files between mobile
PCs and wire-networked computers and printers. Companies such
as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sharp are trying to leverage the
low costs and new fast speeds of IR transceivers to help wireless
LANs gain a foothold in the corporate market.

In April 1995, the three companies came together to support
a new 4-Mbit/s option to the existing InfraRed Data Association's
IrDA 1.1 spec. IBM's Microelectronics Division began offering
4-Mbit/s IR components and LAN drivers early in the year, and
Extended Systems incorporated them into an adapter board in
time for Comdex/Fall. The Boise, Idaho, company's JetEyeNet+,
connecting an IR-equipped notebook computer to a LAN, lists
for $425 and may sell for $295 on the street.

IBM believes the ability to link to the LAN at these prices
will drive IR into corporate networks. But lower prices and
higher speeds aside, IR networks still suffer from an inherent
limitation, offering only line-of-sight connectivity. Upping
the ante, NTT Data Communications Systems, a subsidiary of
Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, has developed a repeater and
PCMCIA card for an Ethernet-compatible, 10-Mbit/s IR LAN. The
catch: its range is limited to 1 meter.

Dream this: The Mainframe's Last Stand

By:
Portia Isaacson

Is the $500 network computer just a lot of noise, or is it the
inevitable replacement for the PC? I think it's the mainframe's
last stand. The $500 "NC" was the brainchild of Larry Ellison,
Oracle's outspoken president and chief executive officer. The
world's second largest software company, Oracle leads the enterprise
software market but has failed to make significant inroads
in PC software. Besides being renowned for its mainframe and
Unix software, Oracle is also known for testosterone overload
in the presence of Microsoft, its chief rival. Oracle's proposed
NC client would replace the PC for users who are always connected
to a server and who run a limited set of applications. The
NC differs from a PC in that applications processing, except
for GUI display and user-input handling, is done on the mainframe,
where all user data is also stored.

If the NC can take application-processor cycles and file-storage
megabytes away from PCs and put them on mainframe or Unix servers,
Oracle stands to gain market share at Microsoft's expense.
The company has unabashedly stated that one of the most appealing
features of the NC is that it uses no "Wintel" parts.

Mainframes have experienced amazing growth in recent years,
driven by the explosion of PCs that suck data off enterprise
servers. But the trend has been to shift applications processing
to client PCs while leaving the database on the mainframe,
where it can be secured, backed up and shared. Nonetheless,
PC applications processing is one step closer to distributed
object, information-bus software architectures, which enable
more choices in database location and implementation. Therefore,
even Oracle's database-software sales could be in jeopardy.
No wonder it wants to start a war to bring applications back
to the mainframe.

The main argument for Oracle's proposed NC is the Web, which
begs for a very low-cost Web-access terminal. Applications
are already being created for the Web or front ended with Web
interfaces, but Oracle would have us believe that Web applications
can replace PC applications. But most apps will not be done
on a Web terminal, because they are too tightly connected to
the user interface to be replaced by a mainframe app connected
to a terminal by a slow wire.

Which hardware manufacturer will take the risk to actually build
and market an NC? Given the specs and price tag, the ones that
will profit in the NC scenario are mainframe and Unix-server
vendors, which will sell more computers and disk drives to
support the helpless NCs they control. Perhaps we can expect
to see Sun and IBM start giving away NCs to help them sell
more big iron.

Rainbow room -- A company spun out of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology has devised a unique way to generate multiple
colors in miniature flat-panel displays

By:
Sunny Bains

A slew of miniature flat-panel display chips now under development
pro-mise to enable a range of high-tech gadgets, from inexpensive
wrist-wearable computers and lightweight virtual-reality headsets
to sophisticated video pagers. Some minidisplay advocates further
project that future large-screen opportunities may not lie
in physically large displays but in high-resolution minidisplays
coupled with the appropriate optics to leverage them into TVs,
computer monitors and projection display systems.

With the minidisplays-many smaller than 1 inch in diagonal and
with resolutions as high as 1,000 dots/inch-pixel structures
and control electronics are built into a substrate using more
or less conventional semiconductor-fabrication techniques.
The substrate may be glass, quartz, ceramic or a silicon wafer;
the display medium may be a conventional twisted-nematic (TN)
LCD, a more exotic LCD such as a ferroelectric or polymer-dispersed
device, an electroluminescent display, a field-emission display
or a tiltable-mirror technology.

One problem minidisplay makers face is how to generate multiple
colors. A new approach to the multicolor dilemma is under development
at startup Micro Display Corp. (MDC), a Berkeley, Calif., spin
off from work done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
by company founder Philip Alvelda. Alvelda's idea is to make
multiple colors an inherent part of the display structure itself.
He has applied the approach to demonstrate a prototype 640
 x 480-pixel multicolor LCD with a mere 4.5-mm diagonal.

Though Alvelda is still putting financing together and doesn't
expect to have the first generation of mass-produced displays
out until 1997, he claims high interest from OEMs. "There is
almost a universal response that if we can make what we have
demonstrated in the lab at anywhere near the costs we predict
for volume manufacture, they will most definitely buy them,"
he says. "As for naming specific clients, it's a little early
to disclose. But we can say that a major PC manufacturer-the
largest one, in fact-is a strong partner in this venture and
that several VR-headset manufacturers are vying to be partners
as well."

The opportunities for the new crop of displays are great, Alvelda
says, but so are the challenges. "Lifetime and reliability
must be very good and well documented," he says. "You have
to be able to throw your pager across the room or leave it
on the dashboard of your car in the middle of summer and still
have some expectation of its working.

"This also means that new displays face a significant barrier
to entry into these markets, where Motorola, for example, can't
afford to recall 3 million new pagers because of a problem
with material lifetime or stability."

A BROAD FIELD

Among those in the mini game are a variety of Japanese LCD vendors
with small, high-density polysilicon thin-film transistor (TFT)
active-matrix (AM) LCDs; Micron Display Technology Inc., of
Boise, Idaho, which has demonstrated a small FED display for
camera viewfinders; Planar Systems, of Beaverton, Ore., which
has developed an AM electroluminescent (EL) display for head
mounted display applications; Displaytech Inc., of Boulder,
Colo., with its ferroelectric mini; Dallas-based Texas Instruments
Inc., with digital micromirror devices; and Kopin Corp., of
Taunton, Mass., which uses a proprietary process to form AM
LCD circuitry on a conventional silicon wafer and then transfer
it to a transparent glass substrate. All confront the color
generation problem.

With conventional AM LCD displays, such as those used in notebook
computers, manufacturers lay red, green and blue filters over
a trio of subpixels to give each pixel its multicolor capabilities.
While that is fine for pixels that are one-third of a millimeter
in size, proper alignment is extremely difficult for miniature
displays, given their small size and high density, some sources
say. And as for multicolor displays such as FEDs, which make
use of RGB phosphors, very small pixel geometries may strain
the limits of current phosphor-deposition technology, according
to sources.

A promising solution to the multicolor challenge may lie in
generating colors temporally, rather than spatially, as in
the old "color wheel" model. Displaytech, for instance, uses
a sequence of light pulses from red, green and blue light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) as the light source for its mini ferroelectric
LCD. TI and Kopin are also pursuing time-sequential routes
to crank multiple colors out of their miniature displays.

One drawback to the temporal schemes, of course, is the need
for three times the frame rate to display the three monochrome
components of an image sequentially in one frame time. A drawback
to the spatial color schemes is that dedicating three subpixels
to the three primary colors reduces effective resolution of
the display by one-third.

In Alvelda's microdisplay scheme, tiny diffraction gratings
are fabricated on top of the CMOS circuitry on a silicon substrate
using conventional fabrication processes. The grating associated
with every subpixel acts like a tiny prism, spreading white
light out into a rainbow-like spectrum. Though all the spectra
in a triad of subpixels are identical, the gratings are designed
so that the spectra emerge at different physical angles. By
using a "window" to mask out all but one color band of each
spectrum, the three subpixels display red, green and blue light.

The gratings of MDC's microdisplay are sets of grooves, reflective
at the top and black at the bottom, which are easily built
into chips during normal fabrication. Creating the offset color
bands is merely a matter of varying the groove spacing. Because
the display's color capabilities are built in during microchip
fabri-cation, the color chips require no more effort or expense
than monochrome ones.

But Displaytech president Mark Handschy questions the advantage
of MDC's approach. "The device has the appearance of being
more monolithic because all the color generation is done on
chip," he says. "But in practice, it's very easy to make red,
green and blue switchable lamps out of LEDs. We're not worried
about integration in that sense: it's not a practical obstacle."

Alvelda counters that many potential minidisplay applications
are somewhat constrained in their lighting possibilities, adding
that the white-light source in his prototype is just "a standard,
garden-variety Maglite bulb from Radio Shack." In a virtual
reality headset, he explains, the microdisplays could be positioned
at the corners of a pair of glasses, illuminated by light sources
located in the ear pieces of the spectacles.

There's a problem with such applications, though, in that the
displays are really too small to be viewed directly, and good
magnification optics, such as microscope objectives, are big,
heavy and expensive. There's no point in a having cheap, high
resolution screen if you can't afford the optics to view it.
But, Alvelda, leveraging the IC technology on which his miniature
display is based, claims to have crafted a solution to the
problem.

MDC's answer is to build a computer-aided-design tool into the
CMOS design software that allows for optical predistortion
of the pixel array. Once OEM customers have specified the inexpensive
optics they plan to use and calculated the aberrations that
the imaging system will produce, the information is used to
design a pixel array whose shape is appropriately distorted,
as well as the size and shape of the individual pixels. Another
CAD tool randomly jitters the pixel position to prevent aliasing,
or the unwanted Moir patterns that often can be produced by
periodic structures.

Particular strengths and weaknesses aside, the miniature display
technologies have the potential to radically change the field.
Alvelda says that in high volumes, the unit price of his display
could fall to as low as $5. Though Handschy won't commit to
numbers that low, he does agree that silicon-based devices
have the potential to be very inexpensive.

"It's fair to say that the dominant cost input is going to be
the cost of the silicon," he says.

Fault line: Fishing on the Internet

By:
Andrew W. Davis

Just when you thought it was impossible to say anything new
about the Internet, along comes a company with a novel announcement
that represents a true breakthrough in thinking, with far-ranging
implications for the technical community. At the recent DSPWorld
trade show in Boston, Texas Instruments Inc. introduced an
Internet-based service called Online DSP Lab, a kind of virtual
laboratory available to users via cyberspace.

If you have engineers using signal-processing products, doing
embedded design or thinking about the next generation of multimedia
peripherals, the TI announcement may change the way you evaluate
vendors and use computer-based development tools. Today there
are four major corporate applications of Internet technology
 e-mail; publishing of product information, newsletters, press
releases, advertisements and other marketing materials; giving
and receiving technical support; and actual sales and distribution
of products. Into this environment comes a new breed of fish
 Online DSP Lab.

Here, any engineer or software developer with an Internet connection
can access a computer to test and evaluate TI's DSP-application
design and development tools. (The actual computers are located
at the lab of DSPnet, an on-line DSP Yellow Pages run by DSP
Associates, which also runs the DSPWorld conference.) Users
can also compile, link and download code to lab computers to
debug and benchmark their own software and TI's software-engineering
tools and new DSP chips. Being Internet-based, the virtual
lab is available free, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to
anyone, anywhere with Net access.

The virtual laboratory is a strategic move. It lets engineers
familiarize themselves with the company's software-development
environment and even test their own code before buying the
tools. This could give TI a competitive advantage in the eyes
of the bench engineer.

The availability of software-development platforms and DSP hardware
reduces or eliminates the need for customers to wait for loaner
equipment. Managing loaners is a sales/support headache for
both the channel and vendors. And to the extent the facility
is used internally by engineering and marketing teams, they're
likely to develop even better tools.

Suppliers who use the Internet will certainly have an advantage
over other companies in the electronics OEM market, and those
who show innovation and creativity are likely to have even
more of an advantage. Creating an on-line laboratory is not
exactly a slam dunk, and the resources involved are significant.
But Online DSP Lab is an intuitive service that directly applies
available technology to the needs of a defined set of customers.
Such trend-setter investments should keep us all on our toes.

Back panel: Digital Cellular Takes Its Toll

By:
Herschel Shosteck

For six years, U.S. digital cellular has been hyped as the technology
wave of the future. In truth, it is more a ripple than a wave.
Digital cellular has been promoted in two flavors: TDMA (IS
54/136), supported primarily by telecommunications giant Ericsson;
and CDMA (IS-95), vigorously promoted by Qualcomm, an R&D company
that owns the enabling patents. Among the major infrastructure
manufacturers,

Northern Telecom, Motorola and AT&T have committed to CDMA.
TDMA has been slow to take off in the United States since its
1992 commercial launch on Southwestern Bell Mobility's Cellular
One System. By yearend 1995, TDMA users accounted for only
about a million of the United States' 33.4 million cellular
subscribers.

TDMA's slow adoption has stemmed from the early illusion that
it could be simply "overlaid" onto the existing analog AMPS
system by swapping a TDMA radio for an AMPS one. In reality,
multipath issues degrade the timing of TDMA RF signals. To
compensate, TDMA cell sites must be placed closer together
than analog sites, resulting in 30 percent higher cell density
than analog-and thus requiring a complete re-engineering of
the entire cellular system.

MetroCel (now AT&T Wireless) announced a $150 million investment
in March for TDMA conversion in Dallas. Many cellular carriers
that are nominally committed to TDMA have been reluctant to
make a similar investment. But only when established analog
cellular systems are properly reengineered to support TDMA
will they deliver adequate reception and find acceptance.

CDMA cellular's path has not been much different. Commercial
CDMA was originally promised to PacTel (now AirTouch) in January
1994. As of yearend 1995, industry expectations of "true" commercial
deployment ranged from first quarter 1996 to late 1997 or beyond.

CDMA was originally promoted as facilitating far fewer cell
sites than conventional analog while providing far higher capacity.
But the technology is cursed with the "near-far effect," or
the need to balance power from the cell site to all terminals
regardless of their distance from the cell. To overcome that,
CDMA proponents may be compelled to deploy a cell density similar
to that of TDMA, which could abrogate CDMA's claimed economic
advantages.

Both digital technologies have claimed a capacity advantage
over conventional analog. However engineering refinements have
continued to improve the capacity of analog systems to far
beyond what was thought feasible in the mid-1980s. Those who
focus solely on digital cellular to the exclusion of analog
thus may find a limited market for their products for a long
time to come.

HOW WILL WE GET OUR GUIS?

After Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh came out with a graphical user
interface (GUI), a lot of people suddenly discovered that they liked-even
needed-computers. Seven years later, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows gave PC
users some of what Mac users get so excited about. Yet millions of people
are stuck with archaic character terminals and character applications for
PCs. If GUIs are so great, what's taking so long for us to get them?
   When I visited the trading floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange this
spring, I didn't see what was so special about its GUI system. Not only
were there no mice in sight, there weren't even any windows on the screen I
was viewing. Then I discovered, as you can from this month's cover story,
that graphical interfaces can take many forms. And, in most cases, the form
that provides ease of use leads to greater productivity.
   For some UNIX techies, the resistance to GUIs is just reaction to
change. One of the best examples of the need for a GUI is desktop
publishing. Would you dream of doing desktop publishing on dumb terminals?
Not so many years ago, thousands of UNIX users did just that. Using the
troff language they embedded commands in their text that were turned into
type by typesetting machines. Imagine having to print every time you want
to see what your work looks like!
   Yes, troff on terminals is cheap-if you ignore the cost of hiring people
who know troff and dismiss the time it takes to proof a page, make
corrections, then reprint it. Techies may love troff, but business folks
are made of more pragmatic stuff-aren't they?
   Apparently not. In business, we have a wealth of tight-fisted managers
who count the cost of systems only in terms of hardware: "Get rid of our
terminals?" they might ask. "Why they work just fine. Besides, our people
already know how to use them." No doubt their predecessors were saying the
same about typewriters when word processors came along 20 years ago-and
about paper and pen before that.
   Productivity, like other measures of efficiency, is not about cost
alone. It is also based on effectiveness. It is more effective to give us
tools that are easy to learn than those that require extensive training. It
is more effective to create more functional applications if the interface
can overcome the added complexity of these more powerful tools.
   Certainly, GUIs have been hyped. Claims that they make computers
intuitive and eliminate any learning curve are absurd. GUI applications
need a consistent "look and feel" that may be lacking in the world of
freewheeling competition among open systems. And because software is a
creative medium, there are poor GUI implementations even when strict style
guidelines are available. None of these is reason enough to delay, much
less reject, GUIs.
   How will we get the GUI software and computers we need to do our work
more productively? First we have to be honest enough to admit that new ways
of working with computers are more effective. We must be open to the
changes GUIs will put us through as users, as well as the power they will
open up to us. Most importantly, we must be willing to invest in the more
powerful computers that are needed to run GUI software-that is, if we
seriously want to be productive.

USL APPROACHES ITS RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY

By:
Edited by Gary Andrew Poole with staff reports. Please send any breaking
news or comments to him at: uunet!uworld!garyp or garyp@uworld.com. Or call
him at 415-513-6900.

After months of speculation, UNIX System Laboratories Inc. is close to
releasing its new family of UNIX products for Intel PCs. The new operating
systems, code-named "Destiny," will have lower prices and better
distribution than existing UNIX versions, and are designed to encourage
resellers to customize the systems without creating incompatibilities. What
remains unclear is whether the traditional high-price, high-margin UNIX
reseller business is ready for a mass-market approach to UNIX.
   The key to Destiny's potential success is that it's not just another PC
UNIX, says Dataquest analyst Rikki Kirzner. For the first time, USL has
thoroughly analyzed its potential market and designed a product customers
want, she says. "They created a really profitable business model."
   According to USL, the new operating systems will be available this
summer, and will be based on System V Release 4.1 ES, the enhanced-security
version of System V Release 4. Destiny will run on most IBM-compatible PCs
with a 386 or higher processor, four megabytes of memory, and a 60-megabyte
hard disk. Along with UNIX applications-which it runs using either an Open
Look or Motif graphical user interface-Destiny will also run PC DOS
applications in a "compatibility window." Destiny will be distributed and
supported as a shrink-wrapped product by Univel, the partnership between
USL and Novell Inc. USL would not confirm pricing or availability, but
Destiny is expected to have a base price of around $300.
   Does the world really need another version of UNIX for PCs? Destiny will
join an already crowded PC UNIX market. The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s SCO
UNIX and XENIX dominate the PC UNIX market with a 62% share; and Sun
Microsystems Inc.'s Sunsoft division introduced Solaris 2.0 for PCs in May.
These vendors are fighting for marketshare against non-UNIX systems such as
IBM Corp.'s OS/2, and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows and the forthcoming Windows
NT.
   For vendors and resellers, USL's business model includes making it easy
to add value without creating incompatibilities. The base Destiny operating
system can be extended by adding modules from USL without recompiling the
kernel. This encourages vendors and resellers to avoid recompilation-and
the incompatibilities it can create. To encourage retail volume, Destiny
will be sold and supported through Novell's highly successful dealer
channel, as well as by USL and its licensees. The base operating system's
price will also be closer to other high-end PC operating systems, such as
OS/2, than it will be to typical prices for existing PC versions of UNIX.
   USL's strategy may sound like overkill for the PC UNIX market, but
Kirzner points out that the stakes are much higher. USL is "the only one
who can compete against Microsoft" for the high-end PC operating system
market, she says. Destiny faces the huge installed base of Microsoft
Windows, as well as renewed competition from IBM's OS/2. USL's technical
advantage comes from SVR4's highly stable code and the security features it
inherits from 4.1 ES. By comparison, Microsoft's NT is likely to be
unreliable for several years, and IBM's OS/2 suffers from a credibility
problem with many potential customers, Kirzner says.

ACE: A SHORT AND TROUBLED LIFE

By:
Edited by Gary Andrew Poole with staff reports. Please send any breaking
news or comments to him at: uunet!uworld!garyp or garyp@uworld.com. Or call
him at 415-513-6900.

The much-ballyhooed Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) initiative hoped
to create a new standard centered around MIPS Technologies Inc.'s R4000
RISC processor, but the only winners in the failed attempt seem to be Sun
and Intel Corp. Sun continues to dominate the RISC workstation market with
a 41% share, according to International Data Corp. And Intel will close the
RISC performance gap this summer when it releases its next generation
microprocessor now known as P5. The fractured RISC market has made Intel
look like a safer choice.
   RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, has been a popular chip in
the workstation world because of its high-performance ratings, which are
almost twice as fast as Intel's highest rated chip. Intel has slowly been
making headway, however. Its P5 chip will run at 100 million instructions
per second (mips), according to an Intel representative. Intel's fastest
rated chip is currently the 50-MHz 486 DX, which runs at 41
mips-top-of-the-line RISC chips exceed 50 mips.
   By teaming together, ACE members hoped to move away from Intel's
dominance, gain marketshare in the workstation market, and set a new model
for computing in the 1990s. It didn't work. Differing agendas and financial
troubles doomed ACE. Of the five founding companies, only one remains fully
committed to the consortium. Reeling from financial troubles, Compaq
Computer Corp. has moved away from any RISC development efforts. PC UNIX
software vendor SCO quit ACE's executive committee and suspended any
related development work. Digital Equipment Corp. has put its weight behind
its own RISC chip, Alpha. And Microsoft has focused its efforts on Intel
processors. Only MIPS, the RISC vendor that had the most to gain from the
consortium, continues to say ACE is alive. Yet MIPS' financial troubles
have lessened its role as a third-party provider, and Silicon Graphics Inc.
recently purchased MIPS for $200 million.

When the ACE initiative was announced in April 1991, it was trumpeted as
the "broadest," "most extensive," "most dramatic announcement ever" in the
computer industry. Now a year later the ACE initiative has fizzled.
   Why are many users confused by hyperbolic vendor proclamations? A good
indication can be found in the topsy-turvy then-and-now comments regarding
ACE:
-- Then: "With the Advanced Computing Environment as a firm, open
foundation, computer manufacturers, software developers, and customers
alike can confidently take advantage of a new nonproprietary
standard."-Doug Michels, executive vp, SCO.
-- Now: After stepping down from ACE's executive committee and suspending
its MIPS development efforts, Michels says, "We haven't really quit the ACE
initiative. You can't quit a state of mind."
-- Then: "If I was at Sun right now, I'd be real worried: 20 major
companies have decided to build something around MIPS that has nothing to
do with SPARC."-John Metcalfe, vp of Silicon Graphics Inc.'s entry systems
division.
-- Now: "OSF was Scud I. We see ACE as Scud II."-Ed Zander, president of
Sunsoft.
-- Then: "We're very excited. We're going to be able to expand the
market."-John Paul, director of systems engineering for open systems at
Compaq.
-- Now: "If we couldn't offer a dramatic price-performance advantage with
a RISC-based system-on the order of two to three times the performance of
Intel's X86 line-customers said, 'We don't want to switch.'"

After 18 months of delays, Oracle Corp.'s Version 7 has been released.
Version 7 is Oracle's database server for enterprise-wide computing, says
Tim Negris, Oracle's senior director of corporate strategy. It will have
applications within the database called triggers and stored procedure
calls. V7 is seen as a catch-up release by some analysts, because Oracle's
competitors, especially its strongest competitor Sybase Inc., have had
these features for almost two years.
   "The significance of V7 is very favorable," says Elliot Prince, a vp at
securities firm Oppenheimer and Co. Inc.
   Although V7 will give Oracle a stronger position in the market, its
financial results have been relatively weak. In the third quarter ending in
March, Oracle reported a revenue increase of 7% to $290 million from $269
million in the same period last year.
   Says Charles Phillips, a vp with securities firm Soundview: "V7 will
give Oracle more revenue momentum."

In a move that brings the X Windows market closer to the PC industry, X
Windows terminal supplier Network Computing Devices Inc. has acquired
Spectragraphics Corp.'s GSS Personal Graphics Division, a supplier of
software that allows PCs to perform X terminal functions.
   "It turns the X terminal and PC markets from being competitive to being
complementary," says Steve Auditore, president of the X Business Group.
It's the first time an X terminal vendor has entered the PC market, he
says.
   NCD has also filed an initial public offering (IPO), and was expected to
go public in late May.
   "NCD's done everything right so far," says Patty Chang, an industry
analyst with Dataquest. She says the GSS acquisition and the IPO are both
beneficial to the company because they expand NCD's market penetration and
add cash for further acquisitions and research and development. "We expect
that NCD will be a continued success," says Chang.

DEC'S DECKED ON WALL STREET

Financially troubled DEC, traditionally a technology-oriented company that
frowned on marketing, has made a cultural flip-flop: DEC will combine
engineering and marketing in the same business units so that it can reduce
the variety of products it sells and bring new products to market faster.
   The move comes after a $294.1 million loss in the third quarter, which
one analyst dubbed "the quarter from hell." DEC will cut its workforce by
more than 10% this month.
   Analysts had predicted that DEC's new Alpha RISC chip would give the
company a much-needed marketing boost, but the hype won't turn into profits
for another year. Although the chip is rated at 150 mips, compared with the
76 mips posted by other processors, it has not yet been widely released. By
that time, some analysts say workstation leaders Sun and Hewlett-Packard
Co. will have matched Alpha's mips performance.
   "Why would someone sign on for a year-long gut-wrenching transition from
DEC's proprietary VAX line to Alpha?" asks Bob Herwick, an analyst with
Hambrecht and Quist. "No one has a big incentive to go with DEC. There's a
sense of disorganization, lack of focus, and long-term lack of
responsiveness."

Sun has a new business unit, called Sunselect, which is aimed at providing
software for integrating PCs with UNIX systems, says Carl S. Ledbetter,
newly appointed vp at Sun and general manager of the new unit. Based in
Billerica, Mass., Sunselect will offer three primary product lines: the
PC-NFS family, a group of products that allow other platforms to take
advantage of UNIX environments; the SunPC line of PC emulation products,
which enable SPARC machines to run DOS and Windows applications; and
Netware Sunlink, a software product that connects Novell Netware local-area
networks to SPARC servers.
   "Sun is trying to coexist with the PC environment," says Ken Ow-Wing,
programs manager at research firm International Technology Group. The
announcement has miffed some SPARC peripheral vendors because of the Sun PC
products. It seems Sun told some board vendors that it wouldn't make its
own accelerator boards-but decided to develop them anyway.
   This comes straight out of the "Idi Amin School of Business," says Paul
Cubbage, an analyst with Dataquest. "Sun doesn't understand it has to
nurture the market."

American Airlines and the CSX Corp., a railroad holding company, have
formed a joint venture to develop a system for trading company
communications, which will be similar to the well-regarded Sabre System.
The Sabre reservation system is the United States' most widely used airline
reservation network. The new computer software service, called Encompass,
is aimed at shippers, consignees, forwarders, and other carriers. Encompass
has standardized on Uniface Corp.'s fourth-generation language (4GL)
software, according to Anu Shukla, Uniface's vp of marketing.
   American and CSX have each invested $10 million in the project. The
potential market for the company is $1.6 billion.

NEW OPERATING SYSTEMS FLOOD SPRING COMDEX IN CHICAGO

By:

him at 415-513-6900.

Comdex is typically a trade show for PCs and products, not UNIX. The spring
edition in Chicago was no exception, but the hottest products at the show
were operating systems that will battle for dominance as upgrades from PC
DOS. Spring Comdex featured the public rollouts of new versions of
Microsoft's Windows and IBM's OS/2, along with the first program that
allows most PC applications to work as X Window System clients. In
addition, USL gave sneak previews of its desktop UNIX Destiny, and Mark
Williams Co. unveiled a new version of its UNIX clone Coherent.
-- Microsoft had an entire floor in the McCormick Place complex dedicated
to Windows-related software and hardware. The company officially released
Windows 3.1, a new version designed to avoid the system lock-ups that are
reportedly common with version 3.0. The Microsoft booth also had
demonstrations of Windows NT running many different Windows applications.
There's no word yet on when Windows NT will be available, but Microsoft
Senior Vice President Paul Maritz told show attendees the company doesn't
believe NT will be a viable product until 1994.
-- IBM's long-promised OS/2 2.0 was finally available for the masses to
"test drive." OS/2 will compete with Microsoft Windows: it runs on all
386-based PCs, is priced roughly the same as Windows, and runs most
existing DOS and Windows 3.0 application software. IBM demonstrated a
forthcoming version that also runs applications requiring the new Windows
3.1. IBM says its agreement with Microsoft prevented it from including the
same capability in 2.0.
-- Quarterdeck Office Systems rolled out its long-promised Desqview/X, a
DOS-based multitasker that allows users to run multiple DOS and Windows
programs simultaneously. Of interest to UNIX users is Desqview/X's X-client
capability: Desqview/X converts the character or Windows display into X
Windows commands, so that an ordinary DOS or Windows PC program can be
displayed across a network on the screen of an X terminal or workstation.
-- Mark Williams Co.'s new version of its multiuser operating system,
Coherent, will run shrink-wrapped applications written for SCO UNIX.
Coherent 4.0 was slated to be available by June for $99.

IBM-BULL AGREEMENT REAPS NEW WORKSTATIONS

The agreement between Groupe Bull and IBM bore its first fruit this month
with the introduction of a new series of Bull workstations and servers
based on IBM's Power RISC processor family. While the move brings Bull into
line with important competitors in the French market, including HP and Sun,
Bull still needs to clarify the value-added component to its monoprocessor
RISC offering. The new DPX/20 systems, range in price from $16,600 to
$158,500, and are little more than IBM RS/6000 workstations with a Bull
label. The software available on the DPX/20 is Bull's new BOS/X version 3.2
operating system, a modified version of IBM's AIX that includes support for
Bull peripherals.
   These UNIX offerings constitute an attempt to regain lost ground in the
burgeoning RISC workstation and server market, and recharge its stagnating
UNIX and open systems line.

IS UNISYS TURNING IT AROUND?

Strong gains in its UNIX systems and software products helped Unisys Corp.
post a first quarter net income of $48.3 million, after a loss of $98.2
million a year earlier. James Unruh, Unisys chairman and CEO, says "We're
not labeled as 'financially troubled' anymore, but we still have a long way
to go."
   Despite Unisys' financial recovery, it is losing marketshare and overall
revenue growth. Revenue was $2.01 billion compared to $2.06 billion in the
same quarter last year. In an attempt to become less of a box vendor and
more of a solutions-oriented company, Unruh says Unisys will increase its
efforts in the software and service sector of its business. In 1990 service
and software accounted for 30% of Unisys revenue. In 1991 it accounted for
35%.
   Some analysts still doubt Unisys' staying power, however. "The crushing
debt is still a long-term problem," says Harvey Hindin, vp with Emerging
Technologies Group. "It's like saying they're trying to climb out of a
mudpile-they could slip back down. Next quarter could be bad again. It's
hardly something to get excited about. Nothing profound is going on at
Unisys."
   Although Unisys has dropped in influence, its financial turnaround has
been excellent, says Catlin Wolfard, ananalyst with Black and Co. He
expects announcements this summer will help the company's financial
picture.

GOOD SOFTWARE IS MORE THAN CODING

By:
Editor-at-Large Walter Zintz is the Advisor Emeritus to Uni-Ops Books in
Boonville, Calif.

Software developers who fight wars over the merits of their favorite
programming tools agree on at least one point: while expertise with one's
chosen tools is absolutely essential to building good software, it's
nowhere near sufficient.
   This month, I look at books that go into five different approaches to
the higher aspects of software construction. Between them they offer a
cornucopia of styles and techniques, with something for everyone working in
software development.

Programming as if People Mattered: Friendly Programs, Software Engineering,
and Other Noble Delusions
By Nathaniel S. Borenstein
Princeton University Press; 609-896-1344
186 pages; 2 pages of Contents
ISBN 0-691-08752-0 hardbound; $24.95
Technical Level: Nontechnical or Theorist
Understandability: Crystal Clear
Summary: What user interfaces should be

In title, this book is about the human-to-software interface. Borenstein
refrains from dealing with the technical aspects of implementing
interfaces, however. Although he spends some time on semantics, he is
primarily concerned with the personal aspect: making interfaces suitable
for real human beings. Users are the main humans considered, but the book
frequently looks at problems of concern to managers and customers, as
well.
   This book's great glory is the author's implicit, but pervasive, notion
that the human interface extends through software; and that programs are
just ways that people tell computers what they should be doing. Combine
this with Borenstein's taste for doing what's "right," and you have a book
that befits the first part of its title, "Programming as if People
Mattered."
   Part two of the title describes his approach. Borenstein frequently
quotes authorities as remote and mystical as the Zen master Ikkyu and St.
John of the Cross. His own writing style is full of passion: eager to
convince, sometimes agitated, even angry about botched interfaces and the
problems they've caused.
   The result is a book filled with points to think about well before you
start coding menus or screens. Directly or indirectly, the subject is what
user interfaces should do, and even what whole programs should do with
regard to how they affect users. The text is bolstered with numerous
quotations and references for further reading. Everything is told in a
conversational style, replete with relevant anecdotes, which is what makes
it an easy-to-read investigation of a complex and controversial subject.

Building Quality Software
By Robert L. Glass
Prentice Hall; 201-767-5937
369 pages; 10 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 0-13-086695-4 hardbound; $38.00
Technical Level: Advanced to Theorist
Understandability: Lucid
Summary: Better software without more managerial meddling

This book's unique stance is that quality in software is not so much a
matter for corporate quality control and quality assurance executives as it
is for individual programmers and their supervisors. Fortunately for the
mental health of programmers and supervisors, the book's other major
principle is that software quality is very amenable to rational,
technological techniques.
   Glass covers a broad topic, and his definition of software quality goes
beyond reliability to include matters such as maintainability and
suitability for intended purpose. Glass' solution mixes practical theory,
technology, personal and organizational practices, and advice on dealing
with the internal politics that inevitably cloud software engineering.
   As befits a book about principles-rather than step-by-step instructions
for a particular environment-Glass stresses his points strongly enough that
few thorough readers will miss any of them. Reading it requires a technical
bent and substantial knowledge of how software development actually works,
but doesn't require knowledge of math or any particular programming
language. Readers who find this level a little high will be encouraged by
frequent ironic anecdotes and a leavening of programmer-style humor. Those
who wish for a higher level will welcome the extensive references to more
technical writings.

Illustrated C
By Leor Zolman
R & D Publications; 913-841-1631
315 pages; 27 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 0-923667-21-0 paperbound; $29.95, $39.95 with disk
Technical Level: Advanced to Expert
Understandability: Almost Crystal Clear
Summary: What to do with all the C you know

Zolman is the programmer who wrote the first C compiler for a
microprocessor-the 8080 chip-back when so many other famous programmers
were saying it wasn't possible. I expect a lot from any programming book by
Zolman, and he succeeds with this book. He plays the Plato of programming
here, reminding us of all the things we know about C and then pointing out
the unavoidable consequences that most of us don't think about.
   The target audience is programmers who have a pretty thorough knowledge
of C basics. This book details which tools should be used and how they
should be used in various programming situations and, to a lesser degree,
why other approaches that may look attractive are actually dead ends.
Zolman concentrates on three difficult-to-master areas in C: pointers,
string handling, and file I/O.
   Except for a few pleasantries like the subhead "Spicy Searching,"
Zolman's writing style is straightforward and matter-of-fact. Everything is
clear, orderly, and complete for the level of programmer this book is
targeted to. The explanations are a running commentary to realistic
programming problems, and the points are usually brought up about where
they should be-just after the reader begins to wonder what will be done
about them.
   There is a lot of code included to illustrate Zolman's points, almost
all of which takes the form of complete and well-commented utility
programs. Readers who favor hands-on experimentation can purchase the book
along with a diskette containing the code. The programs are generally ready
for either a UNIX or a DOS environment; the major exception is that several
are DOS versions of utilities that come with UNIX. The book's listings are
for ANSI C, but the diskette also has versions rewritten for Kernighan and
Ritchie C. Zolman says he's tested all the code. Much of it has passed a
much stiffer test: publication in his "Illustrated C" column in The C Users
Journal.

The Art of Technical Documentation
By Katherine Haramundanis
Digital Press; 800-344-4825 or 617-273-6473
267 pages; 20 pages of Index & Contents
ISBN 1-55558-080-7 paperbound; $28.95
Technical Level: Nontechnical
Understandability: Lucid to Crystal Clear
Summary: More than you ever expected to know about documentation

Haramundanis is a computer documentation writer who wants to tell others
what she's learned about the craft over many years. In the first four
chapters of her book, this works out well.
   She covers the basics of technical documentation and of writing,
workplans, document organization, and even career factors. The methodology
she presents is a good one for most people-I've migrated to many of these
methods myself over a decade of technical writing, and may adopt a few more
now that I've read her book. In just over 100 pages, she provides pretty
extensive and readable coverage. She writes in a style that's an excellent
example of technical writing for non-specialists: clear because it's in
plain language and to the point, easy to read because it's enthusiastic and
conversational, and lively because her method and style change from chapter
to chapter.
   The remaining chapters are less even. Here, Haramundanis goes beyond
technical writing into quasi-related disciplines: graphics, page
formatting, printing and binding, text editors, word-processing software,
other software for writing, and computer hardware. Her knowledge of these
subjects is spotty, and her opinions founder on her lack of knowledge.
She's quite good at introducing and explaining several ways of diagramming
logical information including railroad diagrams, flow charts, and
Nassi-Schneiderman diagrams. But her knowledge of computer software is
weak-a table comparing the features of several text editors has almost a
dozen errors in the vi column alone. Perhaps she felt a sense of inadequacy
while writing these chapters; her style isn't as buoyant here.
   Things look up again in a series of appendixes that hold a glossary, two
bibliographies, contact information for appropriate organizations, and a
list of relevant or semi-relevant standards. All of this is remarkably
extensive, right out to a timeline chart of the historical development of
writing.

Book Brief

Myths and Methods: A Guide to Software Productivity
by David T. Fisher (Prentice Hall).
Fisher explains the German SIABA methodology for efficient software
development. SIABA combines requirements analysis with software structure
analysis. It's a rather technical system, and this is a fairly technical
book.

STANDARD FARE, EUROPEAN STYLE

By:
Joshua Greenbaum

There's no better setting for a meeting on European open systems standards
than Brussels, the capital of the European Community. It's not just because
the European Commission took the lead in 1983 by mandating standards and
open systems for public procurement, a move that culminated in a now-famous
directive called 87/95/EEC.
   It's that the dull, gray, no-nonsense Belgian capital is the perfect
place to hold court on the dull, gray, no-nonsense world of standards.
   Cutting out on Europe's frequent standards meetings to sip beer in
Brussels' Grand Place would also mean missing out on some fairly
interesting and important developments. Like the similarly mundane U.S.
interstate highway network that started under Franklin Roosevelt, the
impact open systems will have on Europe's commerce, trade, and public
administration will be profound and lasting.
   The initial impact of Europe's standards efforts is already being felt
strongly in the public administration, where 87/95/EEC and other directives
have had a strong influence on the procurement and development of computer
systems. These public systems are being designed to serve a new level of
connectivity between countries that will form an electronic interstate
highway system for united Europe's increasingly automated societies.
   The gray-suited public administration types who populate standards
meetings see standardized technology as an important tool to smooth over
the differences in language and business culture that change at every
border. From the processing of taxes across borders to the transfer of
social data between regional public and private entities, the EC is tearing
down the digital Tower of Babel, and it is using open systems
standards-such as those mandated in 87/95/EEC-to do it.
   There is strong sense of purpose about the role of open systems in the
public sector. As stated in 87/95/EEC, the EC must take into account "the
economic importance of the roleplayed by standardization in contributing to
the creation of a Community market."
   And to achieve these goals, the EC is promoting standards-lots of them.
Which means lots of meetings, and lots of gray suits.

So Where Are the Users?
Although the meetings are well-attended, a corporate user in the audience
is as rare as a sunny day in Brussels, which begs an important question:
How well is the public sector leading the private sector into open systems?
It's obvious that, in the long run, the groundwork started in Europe's
standards meetings will build a technology foundation for public and
private users. But how fast this transfer will happen, and how much the
private sector will be able to look to the public sector's standards and
experiences for guidance, is far from clear.
   The answer may be obscure, but the problems with using the public sector
as a private sector bellwether are obvious.
   The creation of open systems standards is a slow and ponderous process.
The gray suits move at a snail's pace, their work is infinitely detailed,
and many say none of it is accomplished with anywhere near the speed
required to make it useful to a competitive, free market user.
   While technologically sophisticated, the standards world can hardly be
called technologically advanced. Its draft standards often concern
technology that has long been in use as de facto standards, and the gaggle
of standards committees have few answers to the pressing needs of users who
are trying to plan truly advanced systems within a five- or 10-year time
frame.
   Most of all, there's a built-in irony in the conflict between private
sector users and standards groups. It's essential that these users
participate to give the standards some universal appeal, but it's hard to
get the users involved.
   At a conference held last spring in Brussels for the launch of the
European Procurement Handbook for Open Systems (EPHOS), a standards text
for networking and file transfer technology developed by the EC, users were
few and far between. Across town on the same day, the launch of something
called the Process to Support Interoperability (PSI) was underway.
   PSI is a certification process set up by an industry group called the
Standards Promotion and Application Group, or SPAG, which is comprised of
such leading European companies as Alcatel Alsthom, British
Telecommunications plc., Groupe Bull, and Ing. C. Olivetti and Co., as well
as IBM Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. Here too, gray suits ruled and
non-government types were in short supply.
   The gray suits at both meetings spoke long and eloquently about the
relevance of public standards work to private industry, and both groups
acknowledged the need for private sector input. But their reasoning for the
lack of that private sector presence seemed specious. According to the
EPHOS organizers, a major reason is that few users have the technical
expertise to participate at the level EPHOS is working on. On the other
hand, the governments, under legal pressure from 87/95/EEC and local laws,
have to have at least some expertise.
   "Much of the reason we have chosen to focus on the public sector is that
we can get at them," says Ken Thompson, chairman of the Commission's Public
Procurement group, only half-joking. "It would be our wish to broaden the
input. But many private sector users don't have the necessary specialists
on staff. It's not their job when brewing beer to become specialists in
information technology."
   There are other reasons. It's expensive to run around attending
meetings, especially for private companies in the midst of a Europe-wide
recession. And especially when many users state privately that the whole
standards business is the scope, function, and raison d'etre, of the
high-priced bureaucrats that the taxpayers in Europe pay so dearly for: Who
wants to pay to watch the watchdog?
   Exactly what gets standardized when is also a major factor. The fact
that the gray suits who brave the Belgian clime to fight the standards wars
are hardly in the vanguard of technology forms another vicious circle for
the promotion of standards in the private sector. Standards by definition
can't be vanguard or even avant-garde: rear-guard is more like it. Ask
anyone why they specify Posix, and you will get a decidedly cover-your-rear
answer.
   But leading-edge technology-which often translates into leading-edge
competitiveness-is not the scope, function, or raison d'etre of the gray
suits. The most complex part of many public open systems procurements is
the systems integration involved: the technology is old hat.
   This rear-guard approach is evident in a recent government procurement
in the United Kingdom to be awarded this August called Osprey. By European
standards Osprey is a large procurement, coming in at 23 million ($35
million U.S.) for its initial phase, with more to come.

Osprey: Ready for Take-Off
Osprey is an effort to shoe the cobbler's children that was developed by
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-the government group most
associated with the promotion of technology to the private sector,
particularly open systems-to automate its own geographically and
structurally diverse empire. Osprey proposes a truly open environment that
takes into account a mix of existing technology and a plethora of
standards.
   But Osprey is designed to contain virtually no leading-edge technology,
and therefore takes no risks. Osprey is innovative in that it provides
thousands of users with a highly configurable client-server environment,
but it does so without any "gee-whiz" technology.
   Despite being a techno-yawn, DTI's approach to an open office automation
environment has a lot of potential use within the private sector, if not as
a model, then as a guideline.
   To come up with the Osprey specifications, the authors analyzed the
workflow in DTI, categorized the existing environment, surveyed user needs,
and built a painstakingly detailed business model.
   What these consultants describe in Osprey is a work environment with
many disparately located offices using a lot of different hardware and
software systems-some open, some not. It's an environment that probably
sounds familiar to most corporate users.
   The work Osprey hopes to accomplish is familiar, too. Osprey is about
pushing paper and data around a service organization-a basic requirement at
the heart of any service sector company or the service department of a
large corporation.
   A number of companies are said to be watching how the Osprey procurement
goes to see if it will become the model for public and private office
automation procurement as its designers would like it to.

Where is the Leading Edge?
If your company wants to do more leading-edge work, where do you turn? Not
Brussels.
   One of the few users at the SPAG conference, Raanan Barzel, a systems
analyst at the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), assails the SPAG's PSI work
and the EPHOS standards as useful, but for an earlier generation of
problems. The initial emphasis within both groups for relatively low-level
communications standards leaves Barzel dissatisfied.
   "We have been addressing the wrong level of standards," Barzel announced
to SPAG's audience. "At the user level, communications shouldn't be a
problem. We want to move ahead to the applications," and to the database,
object-oriented, and distributed processing standards, as well as a host of
other pressing issues for private companies like BNP.
   Such needs leave much of the standards world far behind. But standards
like SPAG's PSI and EPHOS do have an important function, even if they
satisfy a vastly different level of technological sophistication. Although
government types like Thompson bemoan the lack of user input in the
standards process, the intended procurer or developer of a public system is
not necessarily a techie like Barzel, who has been using UNIX since the
late 1970s. In many ways, the whole idea of government standards works best
when users don't have to participate in, or even be aware of, the whole
process.

Snapping Systems Together
Speakers at the two conferences also spoke of an ideal world inwhich
government users would be able to use standards to design open systems the
way a child uses a Lego set. Choose the right size and color piece and snap
it in: There's no need to understand how the snap works, or what went into
building the individual piece.
   What's good for the techno-illiterate bureaucrat could be good for
Thompson's beer brewer: it should be enough to know how to brew good beer
without having to learn to brew standards too. If the standards are
well-defined and a certification process like PSI works-every branded
product interoperates with every other branded product-the brewer can
construct a system by choosing products from an open systems catalog. As
long as the catalog is thick enough.
   And right now it isn't. According to EPHOS and SPAG, the catalog is
limited.
   Even at its best, such a catalog would contain largely gray, colorless
standards. The problem with standards is the blessing, and the curse, of
all creation: that which is created is always made in the image of the
creator. The European open systems of tomorrow, born from the gray,
industrial meeting halls of Brussels, may end up as gray as the suits
sitting in rapt attention at a discourse on X.500 standards.

SUN UNVEILS ITS FIRST MULTIPROCESSING DESKTOP

The new SPARCstation 10 workstation represents Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
vision of desktop machines that progressively integrate more and more
"peripheral" devices. The SPARCstation 10 brings together a half-dozen
features that have never been found in one place before. You can upgrade
the CPU by swapping daughterboards. It has a built-in integrated services
digital network (ISDN) connection, along with Ethernet and twisted pair.
Graphics capabilities are standard. And it's the first SPARCstation with
four SBus board expansion slots and a built-in parallel port for printers.
   Not to say there aren't drawbacks. While the SPARCstation 10 is the
first multiprocessing desktop system, the multiprocessing operating system
you need-Sunsoft's Solaris 2.0-isn't scheduled to be out until later this
fall. If it's speed you're looking for, the single-processor SPARCstation
10 just barely reaches the performance level of the low-end Hewlett-Packard
Co. HP 9000 Model 720 workstation. And although the computer has four SBus
slots, one of them is taken up with a board for 2- and 3-D graphics.
   The fact that the SPARCstation 10 is not just another powerhouse for
scientists and engineers is what differentiates it from the other machines
Sun has introduced at the high end of its product line. On the commercial
side, financial analysts doing lots of number crunching can use its desktop
power without off-loading to a compute server. On the development side, its
built-in audio and ISDN port make it a logical, although expensive,
platform for multimedia application programmers. Sun is also positioning
the SPARCstation 10 as a repository for network management information.
   The workstation uses Texas Instruments Inc.'s SuperSPARC processor,
which integrates all of the integer and floating point calculations-as well
as one megabyte of cache and the memory management features-into a single
chip the size of a silver dollar. The fastest HP machinehas only a
half-megabyte of cache. According to TI, the processor can issue and
execute three instructions per clock cycle.
   The processor also integrates the 64-bit connection to the Sun MBus
slots. The CPU itself is on a detachable daughterboard called an MBus
board, and the peripheral slots accommodate SBus boards. The advantage is
that as semiconductor companies come out with faster SPARC processors, you
can simply lift out one daughterboard and plug in a faster one. The
SPARCstation 10 has two MBus slots so that with two processors and the
Solaris 2.0 operating system, you get multiprocessing.
   Having the CPU on a detachable daughterboard is not a new idea. Digital
Equipment Corp.'s DECstation 5000 machines offered detachable
daughterboards for its RISC CPUs a year ago. The difference is that the
DECstation relies on a single processor vendor, the MIPS Technologies Inc.
subsidiary of Silicon Graphics Inc., but you can upgrade the Sun CPU
whenever the SPARC processor vendors leapfrog each other with a new
design.
   For Nancy Battey, workstation analyst with International Data Corp.,
this investment protection is key to the potential success of the
SPARCstation 10. "It's a great investment story," she says, because users
get "a growth path for future capabilities, instead of locking you into one
system with no room to grow."
   The upgradeable daughterboard is not the only comparison between
DECstations and the SPARCstation 10, though. DEC is making a concerted
effort to position its workstations as multimedia development platforms, as
is Silicon Graphics with its low-end Iris Indigo.
   The place where the SPARCstation 10 outshines the Indigo and the low-end
HP Model 9000 Series 705 workstations is in upgrade capability, says
Battey. "You can upgrade the graphics on the Indigo, but that's it. You get
a solution for today, but what about three years down the road when budgets
are getting cut" and you need a faster machine, she asks.
   The SPARCstation 10 comes in four models: a 36-MHz uniprocessor version,
a 40-MHz uniprocessor version with extra cache on the daughterboard, a
45-MHz dual-processor version, and a 45-MHz four-processor version. The
machine can accommodate up to 500 megabytes of internal memory and up to
848 megabytes of internal disk storage. By comparison, the high-end HP
workstation offers less internal memory (192 megabytes maximum) but more
internal disk storage (2.6 gigabytes maximum). The SPARCstation 10 also has
a 1.4 megabyte floppy disk drive.
   According to IDC's Battey, Sun's concurrent release of the SPARCstation
10 and the SPARCserver 10 will place them snugly at the low-end of the
servers and the high-end of the workstations, and will allow them to steal
sales from both. According to IDC's estimates, 38.6 percent of Sun's 1991
sales of 189,000 units were high-end SPARCstation 2 workstations and
servers. "The SPARCstation 10 will make that percentage go up," predicts
Battey.
   The base price for the SPARCstation 10 starts at $18,495 for a
uniprocessor version; about $20,000 more for the dual-processor version;
and $40,000 more for the four-processor version. For performance figures,
Sun is using the revised SPECmark calculation, which splits performance
numbers into two categories: one to rate integer performance and one to
rate floating-point performance. Sun estimates the preliminary
single-processor SPECmarks for the SPARCstation 10 to be between 40 and 50
SPECmarks for integer performance, and between 45 and 55 SPECmarks for
floating-point performance.
   The diskless low-end HP/Apollo 9000 Model 720 costs about $6,000 less,
but it runs at 55.5 SPECmarks. Sun argues that its workstations provide
"more balanced" performance spread between the CPU, cache, memory, disk,
and network; that is, measuring more than just the CPU, as HP does.
Although Sun still faces some daunting price and performance comparisons
with HP-the winner and still champion of SPECmark races-things can and will
change. SPARC-processor manufacturer Cypress Semiconductor is already
waiting in the wings with an even faster SPARC CPU.

GOING GRAPHICAL

By:
Frank Hayes

At the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), up to $1 million in stock changes
hands every minute. Productivity is easy to measure-it's how fast a trader
can register a buy or sell order in the frenzied atmosphere of the exchange
floor.
   It's all computerized, of course, but there's no time for keyboards, or
even mice. Instead, traders poke with fingers and pencils at graphical
menus on one of TSE's 250 touch screens, then race away to make another
deal. "As an interface," says Wayne Fowler, TSE's director of technology
and network services, "it has been very successful."
   "Ease of use" is a catchy phrase, but it's often hard to measure the
benefit users get from graphical interfaces-and to compare that benefit
with the extra cost of the workstations, X terminals, Macintoshes, or
Microsoft Windows software required to run them. For many information
systems executives, graphical user interfaces are an expensive and
unfamiliar new technology with uncertain advantages over the conventional
character-based systems they replace.
   Fortunately, many information systems people, including the ones we
interviewed, have already been down this road. They've adopted graphical
systems in a variety of industries and applications to accomplish a variety
of goals. They now have the experience to know what's important in making
graphical interfaces worth the extra cost and work in large computer
installations.

The Graphical Revolution
If workstations and PCs were the wave of the 1980s, the 1990s are riding
the crest of mice and menus. The numbers tell the story. Workstations with
graphical interfaces now make up more than half of all UNIX computers.
Sales of X terminals that can run UNIX-based graphical interfaces are
doubling every year. On PCs, Microsoft Corp. says it has sold 10 million
copies of the version of Windows it rolled out in 1990.
   The first mass-market computer with a graphical interface, Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, was introduced in 1984. Butneither the Mac nor
its imitators, such as Windows, were instant successes.
   The problem was typical of new technologies: as long as the old
character-based hardware and software did the job, customers didn't see
much reason to replace them with graphical systems. And, as long as
character applications were selling, there was no reason for software
vendors to invest in learning how to create graphic applications, so there
were fewer graphical applications for users to justify getting the hardware
required to run them.
   It took until the end of the 1980s for graphical interfaces to become an
unqualified success.
   The most obvious elements of graphical systems haven't changed much over
the years: on-screen "windows" that can contain text or pictures, "pop-up"
menus that can be used at any time, and a device called a mouse that allows
a user to choose by pointing rather than by typing.
   What makes the Mac and its imitators user-friendly isn't just the
on-screen pictures and the mouse, although those elements make the computer
seem less forbidding to novice users. Much of any graphical system's power
comes from the consistency of the software applications. "Once you've
learned the first one, it's a lot easier to learn the second and third
ones. They're all alike," says Tom Wnuk, senior data processing officer at
Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   Another benefit comes from multiple windows. Many information systems
departments have turned to graphical interfaces to replace desks full of
terminals, each connected to a different computer system. By networking
those systems, a single workstation or X terminal with several windows can
use each window to replace a terminal-and information can easily be copied
from one window to another.
   Still another advantage is something character terminals just can't
offer: on-screen graphics. As Jack London, director of the medical computer
facility at Fox Chase Cancer Center discovered, that can elevate the
benefit of a graphical system from simple ease of use to much greater
productivity.
   As for productivity, numbers are hard to come by. Academic experiments
in testing labs frequently claim graphical interface users learn
applications faster and use more kinds of software-but does that translate
into more productive work?
   To try to find out the real benefits and costs of graphical systems, we
talked to various users who have put graphical interfaces to work in
business situations. They've learned the power and the pitfalls of these
systems, and most are now convinced that the results-less training, better
applications, and happier users-are worth the price.

Bang for the Buck
The price was higher at TSE than it is at most other organizations that
turn to graphical interfaces, but TSE had a big problem to solve. Its
high-energy traders had no interest in learning a computerized trading
system, yet TSE had committed to putting all transactions through a
computerized "book" to guarantee that all stocks were traded at the market
price. According to Fowler, the solution was a step beyond conventional
graphical interfaces-250 touch-screen terminals and PCs, all running
versions of a Motif-based trading application.
   Fowler says it wasn't hard to get traders to use the touch-screen
system. "They just walk up to it and poke it with a finger or a pencil," he
says. A somewhat tougher task fell to TSE's information systems
staff-writing the custom application that traders now poke at. Even that
didn't require a major effort, Fowler says: it only took two or three
programmers working on the original program for less than six months.
   Since then they've continued to tweak it, especially for speed.
"Windowing systems tend to be very slow," says Fowler; details such as a
background color or whether an on-screen button is shaded can make a
difference in speed. Concentrating on details like these, TSE's information
systems staff has squeezed response time to less than one second.
   And even the touch-screens, which cost $2,000 more than an ordinary VGA
PC monitor, are a comparative bargain, Fowler says. Using high-resolution
monitors for mouse-based workstations would have cost $5,000 to $6,000
each.
   At the Fox Chase Cancer Center, a major cancer research hospital, the
goal was also ease of use, according to London. Doctors and nurses at Fox
Chase used a series of menus on character terminals to check patient
records, but the system was slow and hard to use.
   "They said, 'Why don't you just put Macs in everywhere?'" London laughs.
The reason was cost: replacing each VT220 terminal with a
several-thousand-dollar large-screen Macintosh would have been far too
expensive, and the hospital didn't need full-scale computers-just graphical
terminals.
   Instead of Macs, London turned to relatively inexpensive X terminals to
improve the system's usability-but the result was a new capability. "We did
a little prototype, and showed it to the doctors," recalls London. "They
asked, 'Can you do images?'"
   Although some medical images, such as X rays, require scanning films,
others-such as CAT (computerized axial tomography) scans and MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) results-are already digitized. Today, the text of
patient records and patient-related images are available on the system.
Patient medical files don't get lost, and the images can be used by more
than one person at once-another big plus for productivity.
   But if the graphical system cured a problem, the medicine wasn't
inexpensive. "The cost was in the migration programming effort," London
says. The programming staff had to shift from programming in Pascal on VMS
to C under Ultrix, and had to learn the subtleties of using the X Window
System.
   At Connecticut Mutual, the goal was to give easy access to information
to the customer service department. Customer service was labor- and
paper-intensive for Connecticut Mutual in 1990, which is when the company
decided to move to a graphical interface using Microsoft Windows.
   According to Roger Thibodeau, chief engineer in the company's data
processing department, in the last 20 to 25years, Connecticut Mutual had
built a variety of systems-all on IBM Corp. mainframes-for tracking
policies. The menu-based systems required users to navigate through screen
after screen to track down the value of a single insurance policy, and then
write the information down on paper. Finding the cash value of a customer's
half-dozen policies could leave the customer waiting overnight. And in some
cases, waiting overnight would mean the value of the policies had changed,
so the numbers were already out of date.
   Rewriting the system from scratch was too expensive and, as Thibodeau
points out, "There's a lot of intelligence built in those" older programs.
Instead, Thibodeau's department developed an application called
"Superinquiry." Now, users simply type in the customer's name and
Superinquiry automatically reads the screens from the mainframe query
programs, adds policy cash values, and delivers the information to the
user's PC screen. That shortens the query time from overnight to less than
30 seconds.
   "The net productivity gain is enormous," says Thibodeau-and with that
gain, Connecticut Mutual is on target for paying back its investment in the
graphical system.

Information Systems Solutions
While graphical interfaces can empower users, they're also good for helping
to meet more traditional information systems department goals, including
more efficient software development, reduced maintenance and training for
users, and automating functions to cut costs.
   DHL Systems Inc. provides the core information systems functions for the
affiliated companies that form the DHL Worldwide Express courier service.
According to Deborah Gordon, DHL Systems' manager of development support,
the company turned to UNIX workstations and graphical interfaces to
introduce computer-aided software engineering for developing new
applications and systems. That meant graphical interfaces not only for
programmers, but also for documentation writers who used them to create
manuals, software librarians who used them to track versions of
applications in development, and managers who used them to track
development projects.
   The result was the expected improvement in productivity, but with an
unexpected benefit for the programmers. The new tools, Gordon says, "are
much more complex than any of the tools we had before." Without the
graphical interface, such tools would have been unusable.
   "We are able to make more complex applications. It's quite formidable,"
she says. On the other hand, Gordon points out, "You start needing some
additional skills within your company. You need some standards for the
graphics to communicate. Our documentation group emphasizes using them
properly."
   At WMAQ-TV in Chicago, Ill. the decision to add Macintoshes for the
advertising sales department cut across the grain of corporate computing
strategy. The television station is one of a half-dozen owned and operated
by NBC Television Stations-and NBC is a solidly IBM shop, according to Joe
Harris Jr., director of information technology for the stations NBC owns.
   Harris faced a hard sell convincing his bosses that graphical computers
were a good idea. He finally convinced them that a graphical system would
be easier to learn and use by renting 10 Macs, loading them with software,
and sending them to the executives' children. "Every single executive ended
up liking the machine," says Harris-and now, the television stations he
serves all have at least one Mac.
   But Harris' goal wasn't child's play; he hoped the Macs would encourage
people in advertising sales and several related departments to actively use
the system. Before the Macs, Harris says, information on advertising rates
and customers was available on terminals connected to a mainframe, but the
salespeople rarely used them.
   "Now," says Harris, "it looks just like an Apple commercial," with the
sales staff using the machines for creating sales presentations, preparing
rate schedules on spreadsheets, and exchanging e-mail with ad agencies.
   The network of Macs also promised to require less maintenance and
training than conventional computers or terminals-a crucial item, because
WMAQ didn't want the cost of a large on-site information systems staff. The
result: only a month after training, WMAQ users were not only using their
computers, but had also become largely self-sufficient, and no longer
required Harris and his staff to answer most questions.
   Eventually, says Harris, that will show up in the bottom line by
justifying the $250,000 investment with higher advertising sales and a
smaller budget for technical staff. For the moment, though, it's too soon
to measure the savings, he says.
   Halfway across the continent, the New Yorker got similar results by
pursuing a different goal. Pamela Older, vice president and director of
manufacturing for the magazine, wanted to eliminate the large weekly
typesetting bills by computerizing-but without upsetting the traditional
look or the low-tech habits of the editors. Her solution was to use a
network of Macs where they would do the most good-on the desks of editorial
assistants and the staff that compiles the weekly cultural and
entertainment calendar, "Goings On About Town."
   Exactly matching the New Yorker's well-known look required custom
typefaces and other extra costs, Older says, but the results are worth it:
the $350,000 Mac-based system will save $1 million in typesetting costs in
the first year alone. As at WMAQ, Older says users now learn on their own.
And now other departments, such as research, want Macs, too.

Two for One
At the Gradison division of McDonald and Co. Securities Inc., 60 brokers
once had two terminals on each desk. They would have had three, except that
one terminal did double duty through a special data switch that required
users to switch back and forth between two systems, according to Jim
Honerkamp, vice president and director of computer services for Gradison.
   Today, X terminals let brokers see all of their work in individual
windows at once. "It's a huge improvement over our old environment," both
for brokers and the computer staff, says Honerkamp.
   Under the old system, brokers were often confused by how to use the
double-duty terminals, and the data switch "required lots of babysitting,"
Honerkamp says. Now, with everything on a single screen, brokers don't get
confused, and the information systems department spends less time solving
problems with the brokers and the data switch. "We've been able to actually
reduce our workload," Honerkamp says.
   Eventually, Gradison wants to develop imaging applications, such as
signature verification, but right now the applications are still text-only.
"In the real world," says Honerkamp, "environments are like we have:
multiple proprietary hosts, with users who need information from all of
them. Graphical interfaces can pile these things together very efficiently.
It's the same old environment, just repackaged."
   It's a similar story at the headquarters of the United Association of
Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the
United States and Canada.
   "Overall, the graphical user interface makes a lot of sense," says Don
Lipp, information systems manager for the United Association, a union whose
members have specialties ranging from plumbing to heating and air
conditioning, metallurgy, and nuclear reactor technologies. The union's
headquarters staff has to keep track of 320,000 members, including their
education, skills, and specialities. In the past, that required multiple
terminals on each desk. Now, each user can get information on a Unisys
Corp. mainframe, four UNIX systems, and a Novell Inc. Netware server-all
through a single PC running Microsoft Windows.
   Lipp says he put in extra effort to simplify and automate the users'
log-in process so that the graphical interface and the PC network were easy
to use and reliable. The result: even the least adventurous users now have
all the capabilities they once had through their multiple terminals, while
more aggressive users have fewer limits on their access to information.

The Downside
Not all of the information systems professionals we talked to were
delighted with the results of graphical interfaces. For some, the costs
turned out to be much higher than expected. For others, the expense meant
they had to look for other alternatives.
   Oregon Health Sciences University hoped to use PCs running Microsoft
Windows as administrative workstations connected to its IBM mainframe,
according to Don Adams, microcomputer analyst at the teaching hospital. The
advantage was supposed to be a much shorter learning curve for
non-technical users. But the biggest learning curve turned out to be for
the technical staff.
   "Setting up these machines was very difficult," says Adams, "one and a
half to two days for one machine to work reliably. The set-up program was
very buggy and inconsistent." In the end, the staff had to write its own
installation scripts. Adams expects the new version of Windows to work
better, and he's considering IBM's OS/2 2.0 as an alternative. But until
the installation and maintenance problems are resolved, Windows will only
be on about 50 of the hospital's more than 800 PCs.
   At PPG Industries, Information Services Manager Bob Brookes doesn't
disagree that graphical interfaces can improve productivity-they're on the
desks of all his programmers-but he says the cost doesn't always make it
feasible for office workers.
   PPG, a maker of automotive replacement glass, had users who needed
access to two mainframe systems in its wholesale distribution branch.
However, those users were already accustomed to switching between two
sessions on their terminals. When the company shifted to a UNIX system, PPG
opted for a similar screen-switching program instead of a graphical
interface.
   The chief reason: the cost of installing graphical PCs or X terminals
just wasn't in the budget. "We knew about graphical user interfaces, but
with 450 terminals to replace, the cost was considerable," says Brookes.
The less-expensive solution also reduced the disruption for all those
users-it's much more similar to whatthey're used to, Brookes says. Would
Brookes prefer a graphical approach? "If we could afford it," he says.

Keys to Success
Generally, the investment in graphical systems appears to be worth it. The
key to success is to plan carefully and go slowly when you go graphical-but
go.
   Tackle the departments that will give you the most bang for your buck
first, advises New Yorker's Older. Recognize that you can get a lot of
benefit just from collecting several existing terminals onto a single
screen, say Gradison's Jim Honerkamp, DHL Systems' Deborah Gordon, and the
United Association's Don Lipp. Get users involved, and they'll come up with
new ways to be more productive, agree Fox Chase's Jack London and WMAQ-TV's
Joe Harris.
   Their accumulated experience doesn't translate into proof positive that
going graphical will result in higher productivity. But their accumulated
experience indicates that it is more likely that you'll be able to make a
graphical system worth the investment.


FIGURE 1: Pluses and Minuses of Going Graphical
Pluses:
+ Applications all work in similar ways, so they're easier for users to
learn, and require less training and information systems staff support.
+ Multiple windows let users see all the information they need at once,
and can cut the clutter of several terminals on a desk.
+ Cut-and-paste lets users move information directly into documents,
eliminating copying errors.
+ Graphics can give easier access to non-textual data such as signatures
and medical images.
+ Users are less likely to fight the system, and will use it more
effectively.
Minuses:
- Up-front cost of hardware is higher than for character terminals.
- Building custom applications requires learning skills in graphical
programming.
- Setup and network management may be more complex than using dumb
terminals.

FIGURE 2: Of Mice and Menus
Only about 10 percent of existing desktop PCs use a graphical user
interface such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows. On larger systems ranging from
workstations to mainframes, about 10 percent of the new seats sold each
year are graphics-capable.

ON THE HORIZON

By:
F.H.

The mouse has been a mainstay of graphical user interfaces since their
earliest days, but it may have competition in the future.
   At the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), instead of clicking with a mouse,
users make selections by tapping the screen with a finger or pencil. The
touch screens are expensive, admits Wayne Fowler, TSE's director of
technology and network services, but they're much easier for traders on the
floor to use than a mouse would be.
   Pen computers try to take simplicity a step further by letting users
write on the screen-and recognizing what's been written. The most popular
pen computer is the Gridpad from the Grid Systems division of Tandy Corp.
(Fremont, Calif.). Gridpad, which has been on the market since 1990, is
about the size of an encyclopedia volume; a user can print on the LCD
screen with a stylus, and the computer will slowly convert the image of the
printing into conventional screen type.
   Other computer makers, including NCR Corp. and several Japanese vendors,
expect to introduce similar machines this year. Microsoft Corp. has
released pen extensions for Microsoft Windows, and IBM Corp. has
demonstrated an experimental pen computer that runs UNIX with pen
extensions for the MIT X Window System.
   While pens may let users manipulate graphical systems more easily,
another development on the horizon-so-called "prescient" user
interfaces-may necessitate even less manipulation.
   A prescient user interface remembers how a user performs certain tasks
and, using artificial-intelligence techniques, anticipates some of the
user's actions and provides information the user is likely to need. No such
products exist yet, but Apple Computer Inc. Chairman John Sculley has said
he believes this style of computing would be a potent extension of
graphical technology, especially for users who have trouble with even the
relatively easy graphical systems of today.

A FLOOD OF WINDOWS

By:
F.H.

By the end of 1992, a flood of new and improved graphical systems will be
available for PCs and UNIX. On the UNIX side, vendors of X Window terminals
should begin to use the most recent release of the MIT X Window System,
release five, in products this year.
   But it's the PC market that is seeing the greatest flood of products.
This spring, four companies released new versions of their graphical
systems almost simultaneously. Microsoft Corp. released version 3.1 of
Microsoft Windows, that solved many of the problems of stability and
reliability Windows users have complained about.
   IBM Corp. launched OS/2 2.0, the new version of its multitasking
operating system for PCs that can also run Windows programs. Although
OS/2's earlier versions, which IBM co-developed with Microsoft, failed to
capture the interest of buyers, IBM is now competing directly against
Microsoft for Windows users-and competing hard.
   Quarterdeck Office Systems Inc. (Santa Monica, Calif.) released
Desqview/X, a new version of its multiwindow system that combines an X
Windows terminal emulator and multitasking of character-based DOS
applications. Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a new release of its NewWave
graphical system, and The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. released version 2.0 of
Open Desktop, its UNIX graphical environment.
   Still in the wings are Microsoft's Windows NT operating system, which is
not expected to be available until next year, and the forthcoming Taligent
operating system from Kaleida, the joint venture between Apple Computer
Inc. and IBM.

SUN BLOCK
Its founder incinerated by giant rival Sun Microsystems, Solbourne Computer
appoints a new seer. Can he see a way out of Sun's shadow?

By:
Gary Andrew Poole

Three years ago, Solbourne Computer Inc. wanted to be The Next Great
Workstation Company. The upstart start-up had a better mousetrap and a very
big cheese investor: Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Being tiny,
it could be nimble. Solbourne promised to unveil a workstation a full six
months ahead of Sun Microsystems Inc. that would better Sun's product in
price, performance, and service. Solbourne would become to open systems
what Compaq Computer Corp. was to personal computers-the superior, and
super-successful, alternative. But then Solbourne stumbled and trapped
itself.
   As Sun plodded closer and closer to the marketplace with its next
generation SPARCstation, Solbourne dithered. It had seven products in
various stages of development, including a superior file server. As founder
and president, Doug MacGregor, a technical whiz, juggled limited resources
to try to seize all of Solbourne's opportunities, the workstation began to
slip. It didn't meet performance goals. Deliveries were moved back.
Suddenly those six months were gone.
   Reviewers in 1989 liked Solbourne's Series 4 SPARC-compatible
workstation, particularly its proprietary bus and multiprocessing
architecture, but it was barely cheaper than Sun's original. Today it plays
a minor role in the marketplace, and at Solbourne itself, which has found
greater success with its high-performance server.
   Now Sun is introducing its own server. With nearly four times as many
workers in its marketing department as Solbourne's full workforce of 220
people, Sun seems poised to crush its tiny competitor.
   What has Solbourne done to combat this potentially fatal eclipse? Until
this spring, nothing. MacGregor struggled to eke a profit from the
company's $70 million in annual sales, and says he was on the verge of
doing so. But in April Solbourne abruptly fired MacGregor and named in his
place Carl Herrmann, who had been vice president of international
operations. Equipped with an MBA from The Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania and a background in marketing, the taciturn Herrmann says
he will do a better job of selling what Solbourne builds, rather than build
anything new to sell. Solbourne has already scheduled the introduction of
another server later this year, but research and development will otherwise
take a back seat to marketing.
   If Solbourne's directors hoped their April bombshell would shock their
foes, they are shell-shocked themselves. Herrmann is little known outside
his company, and his first pronouncement, in an interview with UNIXWORLD,
was: "I have helped develop the company's overall strategy. The change in
management does not in any way change Solbourne's strategic direction."
   Herrmann's statement is all the more surprising because, as everyone
outside of Solbourne itself seems to recognize, the company doesn't have
any strategic direction.
   "Solbourne's products are technologically superior-I'm not impressed
with Sun's server line," says Tom Willmott of the Aberdeen Group market
research firm. "But there are serious questions about the future of the
company. It's difficult for a small hardware company to compete against Sun
in the same market niche."
   Paul Cubbage of Dataquest is even harsher in his assessment. "Market
dynamics are against Solbourne," he says. "Does it matter who the new
president is? I don't think so, unless he walks on steam."

Walking on Air
When Solbourne set out to conquer the workstation market, it faced some
hurdles, but hot air wasn't one of them. MacGregor had solid technical
credentials: One of the designers of the Motorola Inc. 68020
microprocessor, MacGregor was working on his doctorate in computer science
in Japan. In October 1987, Sun announced it would license its Scalable
Processor Architecture (SPARC) chip. Burning with desire to clone the
technology, MacGregor approached Matsushita for funding and Solbourne was
born. Matsushita owns 52 percent of the firm, with MacGregor and other
employees holding the balance.
   In January 1989 Solbourne introduced its Series 4 multiprocessing
workstations and a companion line of servers. In October 1990 it followed
with the S4000 workstation, its first uniprocessor model. But Sun's
introduction of its own competing workstation, and its ability to trim
prices and bully distributors into freezing out Solbourne, doomed the
workstations. Solbourne is now emphasizing its newest generation of
servers: the Series 5E, a family of symmetric multiprocessors. The 5E/800i
is a network server that supports up to four processors for an office
environment; the 5E/900 Enterprise Server supports up to eight processors
for computer rooms.
   However, "No hardware company, whether it's $70 billion or $70 million,
will survive if it doesn't add significant value to its hardware," says
Shmuel Halevi, vice president of The Technology Research Group.
"Solbourne's trying to add software value, but how well it's executing is
yet to be seen."
   Just before MacGregor was sacked, Solbourne belatedly formed a software
business unit to focus on the development, distribution, and support of
software products for building X Windows-based C++ applications. The
software group is small-11 developers and four marketing and sales
people-but it has made agreements with Centerline Software Inc., Parcplace
Systems, and The Qualix Group, to help develop and distribute
object-oriented technology. But even this tentative step forward has come
at the expense of internal dissention.
   "There has been some resistance from the hardware sales and marketing
side," says George Kakatsakis, general manager of the new unit.
Nonetheless, he insists, "We're moving toward the high-end, commercial
customer, and they need this type of development environment."
   Solbourne has indeed made gains in the commercial market, where its
technical excellence is less important than it is with scientific
purchasers. Commercial sales have increased sixfold in two years, but
remain just 30 percent of Solbourne's business. Here too, the company
remains a hardware player, and that has meant micron-thin profit margins.
Solbourne officials claim the company will manage its first-albeit
tiny-profit this year, but only by cutting staff to the bone-Solbourne laid
off 10 percent of its workforce early this year.

What Will Solbourne Market?
Sun's new line of servers attacks Solbourne where it lives-in technology.
Sun's new machines are based around the Viking chip, which promises to have
excellent multiprocessing capabilities. Solbourne's symmetric
multiprocessing operating system has been superior to Sun's operating
system, but the Viking-based server could overcome any performance gaps. If
the chip delivers, Solbourne's only market-and only marketing-edge
disappears.
   Hunkered down in his Longmont, Colorado, headquarters, Solbourne's new
general has met requests for information by shunting questioners to his
lieutenants. Travis White, vice president of marketing, says, "We've had
great technology, but we've never articulated it. With Carl, we'll increase
our marketing push."
   On the battlefield, that would be called a tactic, not a strategy-and
it's a frail one. White's staff numbers 15, and while it recently embarked
on a direct mail and print advertising campaign to generate name
recognition, Solbourne might have done better to keep its wallet in its
pocket and go courting its existing customers. Their loyalty is suspect.
   "I have some serious concerns about Solbourne," says Russ Goebel, a
systems analyst with Sandia National Laboratories, a research and
development company for the U.S. Department of Energy. "If I had to make a
decision today about buying a Solbourne machine I'd wait."
   Goebel uses a Solbourne Series 5000 600 multiprocessing machine, but
says he's concerned about buying machines from SPARC-compatible vendors
because he says Sun "calls all the shots" and that's "dangerous because
their future is in the hands of one vendor."
   And although Solbourne's fate will be decided in the U.S. market, its
new president has spent most of his career abroad. Before joining Solbourne
last year, Herrmann ran the Far East operations of Hong Kong-based Amphenol
East Asia Ltd., a worldwide supplier of cables and connectors for the
electronics industry. Before that he was managing director of the Singapore
subsidiary of Genrad Inc., a vendor of test and measurement systems for
electronic and mechanical products.

A New Watch-Or a Death Watch?
Analysts say Solbourne can probably coast on the strength of its file
servers for at least another year. Its emerging software products offer a
glimmer of hope that the company can transform itself into a value-added
vendor, as well as a high-quality manufacturer. But replacing a technical
genius with a marketer doesn't inspire confidence on that score. Appointing
Herrmann to run the company at least postpones the other option Matsushita
faced before Solbourne acted-pulling the plug altogether.
   "Matsushita is one of the most respected manufacturing companies in
Japan," says Jeff Morgan, co-author of the book Cracking the Japanese
Market, "but it's facing some tough economic times. It's scaling back its
outside investments. Solbourne has to answer to Matsushita."
   "The Japanese," he adds ominously, "will kill a company without
flinching. They're very unsentimental."
   Since Matsushita made its initial investment in Solbourne, the Japanese
stock market has crashed to about half its former level. Although $60
billion Matsushita dwarfs $3.6 billion Sun as completely as Sun dominates
Solbourne, the Japanese economy is tottering on the edge of recession and
even its biggest conglomerates are retrenching-especially in the United
States, where investments from Rockefeller Center to Pebble Beach have gone
sour. Solbourne represents an almost trivial investment when compared to
those glamour deals, but as MacGregor's firing makes clear-it doesn't pass
unnoticed.
   For now, Solbourne Computer has been given a new lease on life. New
President Herrmann will wring as many marketing dollars from Solbourne's
cash flow as he can, and he'll start making the calls. It's a sales mantra:
"You make the calls, you get the business."
   The market will be watching. Is Herrmann another Lee Iacocca? Or is he
another Willy Loman?

THE WIZARD OF AUSPEX
"You need someone to map between what the engineers know and what users can
understand," -Bruce Nelson, chief technologist, Auspex Systems Inc.

By:
Howard Baldwin

ONE WINDY DAY IN 1983, DURING one of his many South Sea sabbaticals, Bruce
Nelson was driving on a two-lane highway between Cairns and Townsville on
Australia's northeast coast. Seeing a fallen tree blocking the road, he
stopped to drag it out of the way. As he approached, though, one end of the
obstacle slowly rose and hissed at him. It wasn't a tree. It was a 12-foot
python stretched across the road, warming itself on the asphalt.
   Unperturbed, Nelson grabbed the end that didn't hiss and wiggled it up
and down until the python slithered off the road. As chief technologist for
Auspex Systems Inc., a manufacturer of high-capacity file servers, Nelson
would like to handle the computer industry the same way: just yank the tail
of the marketing people and maneuver them out of the way of the customers.
   Everyone knows someone like Nelson: a freewheeling know-it-all who
whizzed by on the way to fame, fortune, and founders' stock. Except for
Nelson, now 40, it hasn't happened. His friends expect great things from
him, and compare him to Andy Bechtolsheim, the brilliant but mercurial
creator of the SPARCstation upon which Sun Microsystems Inc. has built its
fortune. But this Nelson guy is plugging away for a single-product server
vendor, his third start-up firm in eight years.
   He marches to a different drummer and scoffs: "I don't feel any
compulsion to meet their expectations. I compete largely with myself. I
don't compare myself to other guys who I see in industry or in private
life." So why hasn't anything clicked for Nelson? "Sometimes I stick with
things too long. I think I'd be further down the road if I was less
committed and more mercenary."
   What has Nelson committed to now? Stand back, vendors-he wants nothing
less than honesty from an industry awash in hype. He wants customer
adversaries to become customer advocates-even among Auspex's competition,
which includes the server divisions of Sun, Silicon Graphics Inc., and
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   If people expect great things from Nelson, and Nelson expects great
things from the industry, perhaps it's because his first job out of college
was at Xerox Computer Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where many
of technology's greatest ideas were born. He joined PARC after receiving
his master's degree in computer science from Stanford University in 1976.
The technologies taken for granted today-mice, networking, laser printers,
object-oriented programming-were being developed by the industry's most
creative minds all around him. He alternated between PARC and
Carnegie-Mellon University, where he got his Ph.D. in computer science in
1981. At PARC, they joked that you could tell when the hyperactive Nelson
was back for the summer because there were footprints on the ceiling.
   With other researchers in PARC's computer science lab, Nelson defined
the technology known as remote procedure calls (RPC) that underlies the
distributed computing standards the industry will use in the 1990s. But
Nelson does not benefit financially from the companies that have chosen to
use RPCs because Xerox never patented it.
   His PARC co-workers went on to found companies including 3Com Corp.,
Adobe Systems Inc., and Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. Nelson left after
five years at PARC to work for the Australian equivalent of the National
Science Foundation, and then, starting in 1984, spent five more years
helping to found two start-ups.
   The first, Austek Microsystems Ltd., was a U.S.-Australia joint venture,
for which Nelson had both engineering and marketing responsibilities. He
headed up projects as diverse as computer-aided design tools and add-in
graphics boards. Today Austek builds cache controllers for PCs. That Austek
and Auspex have such similar names is a coincidence that sometimes confuses
his friends: Austek is a conjunction of "Australia" and "technology," while
Auspex is the French singular of "auspices" and roughly translates as "a
good omen."
   Nelson left Austek in 1987 with 15 other employees in a "friendly"
spin-off called Cogent Computer Corp. for which Nelson was vice president
of strategic marketing. Cogent's plan was to build a PC that integrated
graphics, networking, and a Windows 2.0 interface-but the plan failed when
Ing. C. Olivetti and Co. withdrew an offer of needed seed money.

No Regrets
Does Nelson have regrets about the five years he dedicated to Austek and
Cogent? "It's not something I dwell on," he says, adding that he learned
some important lessons-even great technical strengths won't overcome
weakness in sales and marketing, for one. "Sales and marketing are
important," he now realizes, "even though it's not what I wanted to hear
then." That's why he considers marketing important these days-too important
to leave to marketing people.
   But you can't write Bruce Nelson off as the personification of Xerox
PARC-a sad reminder of what might have been. For one thing, Nelson is too
intense to be dismissed. He talks fast. When Bob Lyon, vice president of
engineering for Legato Systems Inc., has been on the same dais as Nelson,
he establishes the speed at which Nelson talks at one Nelson, and then
says, "I'm going to speak at 600 milli-Nelsons."
   Nelson is very intense. The story goes that he went off to Australia
with a girlfriend, and a year later she came back proclaiming that she
didn't want to see Australia or Nelson for the rest of her life. He's also
a mechanical whiz. Another ex-girlfriend, now married, says, "I still think
that when something's broken, I'll wait for my husband to leave town so his
feelings won't be hurt, and get Bruce over here to fix it."
   To some people, he's obnoxious-but Nelson is not a glad-hander, and
there's no b.s. given or taken. "People can see him as opinionated," shrugs
a co-worker, "but the guy is so smart and thinks so fast. What comes across
as abrasive is being real direct. He's a real fount of ideas and he has no
qualms about sharing them."

The Quest for Hypeless Marketing
Today, at Auspex and in the industry, Nelson is trying to keep marketing
people honest by whipping their tail up and down so that they get the heck
out of the way of computing.
   Privately held Auspex had 1991 sales of $40 million, and company
officials say it will boost revenue 25 percent this year. It was the first
company to build a high-capacity file server, and one of the first to
suggest that servers should be engineered from the ground up, rather than
just using a retrofitted workstation or PC without a monitor. As chief
technologist, Nelson acts as the technical spokesperson for customers and
at conferences for the file server manufacturer. He has his fingers in all
phases of sales, marketing, and engineering, looking at everything from
benchmarking methodology to evaluating what he calls "make/buy/ally
decisions."
   Nelson is apt to stalk into a competitor's booth at a trade show and
challenge that company's claims. He insists he's found his rivals using
year-old information to make Auspex look bad. And, he insists, he's just as
tough on his own salespeople. "One of my jobs is to be sure of what other
vendors' products do so that our salespeople can be fair about saying
Auspex is better...When I find something egregious, like saying our
price-performance is eight times better than an IBM server, I take it
out."
   One of the ways Nelson has tried to keep his industry honest is by
organizing Laddis. Named for its members-Legato Systems Inc., Auspex,
Digital Equipment Corp., Data General Corp., Interphase Corp., and Sun-the
group's benchmark measures network file system performance and has been
adopted by the System Performance Evaluation Consortium, otherwise known as
SPEC.
   "You need someone to map between what the engineers know and what users
can understand," Nelson says. "Laddis is a way to keep people honest across
the board."
   This marathon talker, some of his colleagues insist, is also a good
listener. Says Auspex President Larry Boucher, "Because of his objectivity,
because he's there to help the customer, he winds up being a real asset."
   In a reflective mood, Nelson gives a hint of self-assessment when he
discusses a one-time co-worker at PARC. "He's not yet an elder statesman of
computer science," he says. "He's one of the brilliant minds that's
remained in the background."
   Like others that came out of PARC, Nelson is not yet famous, but he
still has time to achieve fame and fortune.

SO, YOU WANNA LEARN ABOUT UNIX
Because UNIX and easy-to-learn aren't two phrases you normally put
together, we've compiled a list of eight top books to help you get started

By:
Walter Zintz

Bringing novices up to speed on the UNIX operating system can be a rather
daunting task. When UNIX's command-line prompt pops up on a terminal
screen, the question "Where do I go from here?" pops up in the mind of a
befuddled new user. With a software system as powerful as UNIX, it's
understandable that beginners might be hard-pressed to quickly master its
complexities when armed with only a set of inadequate manuals or poorly
organized books.
   Although friendlier interfaces are available for most of today's newer
systems, they aren't of much help when it's necessary to fix a system
problem or do work beyond the ordinary. There are also a significant number
of existing UNIX systems without graphical interfaces that require
knowledge of such arcane utilities as the vi editor, awk, and grep in order
to do the job. If you don't find the UNIX manuals very helpful, there are
some well-done how-to books that can help fill the gaps.
   There are almost 100 books in print that introduce users to the UNIX
system. The majority are for readers who have no experience with other
computing systems, and hope that they can learn the basics of computing
while learning the basics of UNIX. Most of these books are aimed at people
who just want to learn how to use UNIX for their own work, although there
are some good starter books for system administrators and programmers. This
article will introduce you to what I regard as the eight best choices for
learning both computing and the UNIX system from scratch.
   This collection covers UNIX versions from the early, but still much
used, Version 7 to the latest System V Release 4 (SVR4), as well as popular
variants such as The Santa Cruz Operation's XENIX and UNIX. These books are
written for readers ranging from enthusiastic technical types to people
whose secret wish is that computers would just go away.
   I won't pretend that non-networked systems and character-based terminal
screens are the future of computing-UNIX systems today feature tight-linked
distributed computing and bit-mapped, mouse-controlled, windowed screens.
No introductory UNIX book in print today covers such systems, however. For
now, beginners on those advanced systems will just have to switch back and
forth between any of the following UNIX books and the available network or
GUI information sources.

Introducing the UNIX System
by Henry McGilton and Rachel Morgan
For those who will use a UNIX system primarily for its text processing
utilities, this is one of the two introductory books-the other being UNIX
for People-worth your time, and should also be considered if you want to
become a proficient user without becoming a nerd. Although this book is
based on the older Version 7 of UNIX, introductory UNIX books just don't
come any better.
   The fact that this book starts from scratch and gives coherent
explanations makes it a good choice for even the true beginner. It manages
to go beyond the basics to provide extensive coverage of text editing and
text formatting, as well as a good start on system administration and UNIX
as a programming environment. There's even a solid introduction to shell
scripts.
   Despite the amount of ground covered, there is never any feeling of
being rushed. The authors have the knack of taking just a few words to say
something clearly enough that it does not need to be repeated. The book has
a lot of information on the ubiquitous vi editor and its alter ego, ex, as
well as the ed and sed editors. Even with this ambitious list, the authors
manage to go into enough detail that readers can become quite expert at
online editing. The same holds true for coverage of nroff, a cryptic
non-WYSIWYG text formatter, the ms macro package for taming nroff, and the
tbl preprocessor for creating tables.
   There are no nasty surprises when you start to get down to work, either.
The authors almost never forget to mention the exceptions to rules that
would otherwise appear to haunt you in real-life use. And while no how-to
book is completely free of technical mistakes, this one comes amazingly
close-better than any other introductory book I've encountered.
   There is one detracting factor: this book is specific to UNIX version 7,
with an extra chapter on some of the Berkeley UNIX extensions. Version 7 is
the direct antecedent of almost all UNIX versions presently available, but
the systems that use Version 7 or a clone today usually call it something
else. Current descendants have new or extended utilities that aren't
covered, but the book is still hard to top for learning the basics of UNIX
before getting into specific versions.
   Don't confuse this book with Introducing UNIX System V by the same
authors: the books appear similar, but are quite different inside.

The UNIX Operating System, second edition
by Kaare Christian
This book is my choice for software developers who are brand new to UNIX,
but knowledgeable about computing in general. This group of users will like
the book's slant toward UNIX as a programming environment, and the
explanations of why various aspects of UNIX are the way they are.
   Shell programming and editing in vi are the techniques most thoroughly
discussed. As for discussion of UNIX internals, it's mostly about the file
system, the Bourne shell, and the kernel. There are also chapters on
benchmarking-complete with a benchmark shell script-and the relationships
between UNIX, PCs, and DOS.
   Beyond that, the book focuses on explaining approximately 100 utilities.
But this book is a supplement, not a substitute, for the manuals-it most
often restricts itself to peripheral advice on the best way to use a
particular utility, and comments on how and why the utility became what it
is.
   For an ambitious non-UNIX programmer, this book should be ample
preparation for The UNIX Programming Environment by Kernighan and Pike. The
ordinary programmer needn't go that far: this book explains as much about
UNIX for programmers as necessary.

UNIX for People
by Peter M. Birns, Patrick B. Brown, and John C.C. Muster
This is the book that will rescue people who don't get along well with
computers-it's written for people whose field of expertise is something
other than computing. The book's pace is not too fast, no experience in
computing is assumed, and the tone is mellow and understanding throughout.
Explanations are explicit and thorough, and frequent reminders reinforce
what's already been covered.
   This book's greatest strength is in its skillful presentation of
information. In the course of their varied careers, the three authors got
as far as Ph.D. candidacies in education and/or psychology, and they use
what they've learned to make a dry, technical subject easier to learn.
   On top of that, this is one of the two books I enthusiastically
recommend to people who want to specialize in the text-processing end of
UNIX use. In this area, the book improves on McGilton and Morgan's book in
certain ways, such as dropping coverage of the obsolete ed editor in favor
of the important troff text formatter. As for general UNIX use, it covers
most people's needs.
   This book's 29 chapters-enhanced with various learning aids, and
supplemented by features such as "roadmaps" that demystify certain command
transitions-make up a good basic education in UNIX. Readers who want to go
farther-without giving up the embedded learning techniques-can contact the
authors about the set of follow-on modules they've self-published.

A Practical Guide to UNIX System V second edition
by Mark G. Sobell
One of the strong points of this book is that Sobell is not a UNIX
cheerleader-he admits the system has problems as well as benefits.
Nonetheless, he has written a fine book for fairly technical readers who
want both a text and a reference manual.
   Sobell has made significant improvements since the first edition by
bringing in topic experts to critique and sometimes rewrite chapters. The
result is a well-rounded book.
   First and foremost comes a text section that occupies almost two-thirds
of the book, and moves the reader pretty far along on everything of
importance to users, as well as introduces the programming environment and
system administration. Then, distinguished by black page-edge indexing,
comes one of Sobell's specialities: reference pages for a large number of
commands and utilities, complete with examples. Don't confuse these with
the official, cryptic man pages provided in UNIX documentation-these lucid
pages are more like what the man pages should have been.
   The book's technical level is rather broad. Thoughtful beginners should
have little trouble with the explanations, especially if they pay attention
to each chapter's introduction, summary, and exercises. Likewise, people
with considerable computing experience on other systems should not find
this book slow or pablum.

Peter Norton's Guide to UNIX
by Peter Norton and Harley Hahn
This book is aimed at complete beginners, especially those who are serious
about learning both computing and UNIX well. The authors make it clear from
the start that using UNIX should be fun. They're right, of course, and none
of the other introductory technical UNIX books I've seen encourages this
fact.
   The writing style is slow, engaging, and helpful. By the time they reach
the end of the book, readers will be at the upper apprentice level and
well-grounded in the basics. The explanations of the ASCII code are by far
the most lucid and complete I've encountered in any beginner's book on
UNIX. Sidelights on UNIX history and philosophy are sprinkled throughout,
which serves as another tool to keep the book from seeming dry.
   The book includes frequent comparisons to DOS, which makes it a good
candidate for those who are moving to UNIX from DOS. My only reservation is
that the number of technical errors is a little higher than usual amongthe
books on this list.

Using UNIX
by David W. Solomon, Tanya Rodrigue, Mark Schulman, Rosemary Colonna,
Dennis Fairclough, and David H. Lender
This is a good choice if your company is only willing to buy one book on
UNIX SVR4 for everyone in the company below the level of UNIX guru. It
starts out talking to readers who don't know exactly what a computer is,
and is filled with clear explanations, screen dumps, and other
illustrations.
   The book never bogs down at the simplest level: well before the
midpoint, the concept of file block sizes as they relate to space wastage
and file fragmentation is introduced. The book provides frequent
comparisons to DOS, but you need not know that system to follow this book
easily.
   A reader choosing an introductory book for personal use might also
select this book. After the first few chapters, sections can be taken
individually, which allows you to dip into it as needed.

UNIX System V Release 4: An Introduction
by Kenneth H. Rosen, Richard R. Rosinski and James M. Farber
This volume's huge 1,228-page count is devoted to explaining just about
everything about SVR4 except the guru stuff. After covering the usual
beginner topics in great detail, it goes on to specialized matters like
security, network administration, and running UNIX along with DOS. The
result is a book with a lot to say to every serious reader, from the
complete computer neophyte to the fairly advanced intermediate.
   The writing is reasonably clear, although it is a little dry, and
written at the right level for determined beginners or ordinary
intermediate users. The page allows plenty of room for extended
explanations, sidelights, comparisons to DOS, and reference material. My
primary reservation is that the frequency of technical errors is high. It's
not any worse than the average introductory UNIX books, but it is
noticeably below the standard set by the rest of the books in my top
eight.

Using SCO UNIX
by Geoffrey T. LeBlond, William B. LeBlond, Sheila R. Blust, Wes Modes,
and Ross Oliver
This isthe book I recommend to people involved with XENIX and UNIX from The
Santa Cruz Operation. It's a very good book on UNIX with a lot of
SCO-specific information as a bonus.
   This is the only book in my top eight that offers help with installing
the system software on a new computer. Another pleasant surprise is the
inclusion of chapters on constructing filters, understanding SCO business
software, dealing with uucp, and running DOS under UNIX.
   The technical range is medium, and the writing accessible to fairly
astute beginners. After reading the entire book, the reader will be well
into intermediate user status. Skimming is pretty safe because the authors
use icons in the margin to draw attention to points that shouldn't be
glossed over.
   Those who like its style, but have other variants of System V, should
turn to Using UNIX System V Release 3, which is also published by
Osborne/McGraw-Hill and has essentially the same structure.

Other Resources
Although there are seminars and video courses galore available, some of
which are quite good, they are unnecessary when books like these are
available. A judicious selection from among these books should get any
beginner off to a great start.

LIVING THE UNIX LIFE

By:
W.Z.

While you're using one of the books discussed in this article to learn the
technical side of UNIX, don't neglect the broader aspects of the system.
   Over the decades, a tradition, community, and style have developed
around UNIX. The most pleasant way to introduce yourself to all this is to
pick up a copy of Life with UNIX: A Guide for Everyone by Don Libes and
Sandy Ressler, published by Prentice Hall.
   Their book provides plenty of history, mixed with tidbits of gossip, as
well as guidance toward printed information, industry events, the Internet,
services, and application packages. An abundance of contact information is
provided along with realistic evaluations of what's mentioned. There's a
chapter on how UNIX is faring in the larger world of general computing that
features the cons as well as the pros of the UNIX system, and another that
fearlessly predicts future directions. Technical aspects of UNIX are
overviewed in three chapters.
   Best of all, it's a no-pain, no-strain read. The writing style is breezy
and buoyant. Even if I weren't involved with UNIX, I could see myself
reading this as an evening's diversion-it's more gripping than the average
paperback novel. I doubt I'll ever see this book's equal as an entre into a
computer user community.

UNIX NETWORKS GIVE PCS TRUE POWER

By:
Darrin Brown

One of the most pressing needs for businesses today is to connect DOS
systems to high-speed UNIX networks. It's a marriage of opposites, but it's
also one of necessity-and one that has numerous products lining up at the
altar. So we looked at three major DOS suppliers of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
all-important Network File System (NFS).
   Why is NFS so important for PC users? It, and the underlying TCP/IP
network transport mechanism, gives a childlike simplicity to sharing files
and running programs on remote systems. For DOS users, NFS is a no-brainer:
anyone who can copy a file from one drive to another is an NFS champ.
   We tested NFS and TCP/IP network software by FTP Software Inc. called
PC/TCP Plus, Sun's own PC-NFS, and 3Com Corp.'s 3Com TCP with DPA. We found
PC/TCP Plus to be the better performing product at $490, although the more
expensive-up to $665-PC-NFS is the best choice for users of Microsoft
Corp.'s Microsoft Windows. The 3Com TCP product, while functional, falls
short in working with the UNIX environment because of its leaning toward a
DOS peer-to-peer network design.
   We chose to review the FTP and Sun products because of their undeniable
stature. For contrast, we chose 3Com's TCP because of the company's good
name in the DOS market. Other vendors with TCP/IP and NFS products that
could have easily qualified for this review include Atlantix Corp.,
Distinct Corp., James River Group Inc., Network Research Corp., Novell
Inc., Structured Software Solutions Inc., and Wollongong Group Inc.
(Editors' note: We will review products from several of these vendors in
the future.)
   In addition to NFS support, each of the reviewed products offers access
to remote computer systems and the ability to quickly and easily transfer
files from one system to another. PC/TCP and PC-NFS also offer an e-mail
facility. These basic functions allow people, not just computer systems, to
interact more efficiently.
   Our test network consisted of a 66-MHz 486 system from Sprite Inc. (San
Jose, Calif.), a 25-MHz 386 from Everex Systems Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), and
an IBM Corp. PS/2 Model 70. A Sun IPC acted as the common server for the
PCs running Sun's PC-NFS daemon. Also on the network were a Nextstation
from Next Computer Inc., a SPARCbook notebook computer from Tadpole
Technologies plc. (Cambridge, England), a model 9000/710 workstation from
Hewlett-Packard Co., and a TX100 X terminal from Visual Technology Inc.
(Westboro, Mass.). We used thin coaxial cable-Thinnet-as our network
medium.
   Our objective was to determine which software product provides the best
NFS and TCP/IP service to a standard Ethernet network. We also considered
the network interface cards that create the physical network connection,
because they are essential to network communication. The PS/2 was included
in our network so we could test Microchannel interface cards in addition to
the 16-bit cards for the extended industry-standard architecture buses on
the Sprite and Everex systems. We tested cards and software alike under DOS
3.3, DOS 5.0, and Microsoft Windows.

The NFS Advantage
NFS was developed by Sun in 1984 to provide transparent access to files on
the network. Under NFS, designated directory hierarchies appear to be local
to all connected systems. Importantly, the design of NFS gives users almost
identical file access performance-with up to a 20 percent reduction
possible-compared to local hard disk access. NFS also provides graceful
crash recovery and supports network printers, plotters, scanners, and tape
drives, among other devices.
   For open systems computing, the most important aspect of NFS is that it
supports multiple operating systems, including UNIX, DOS, VMS, and Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Transparent file access is enabled by allowing
multiple nodes on a network to become servers by sharing or exporting their
local file systems. These servers must be true multitasking
machines-meaning they must be able to run several daemons simultaneously,
such as nfsd, pcnfsd, and mountd.
   NFS client systems mount the exported file systems and assign a
seemingly local drive or directory name to the remote mount point. On our
test DOS systems, we used a variety of drive letters. Allowing the client
to use its own naming conventions a strong point of NFS.
   Crash recovery is straightforward. If the server goes down, the client
hangs if it is hard-mounted, or times out the connection if it is
soft-mounted. In either case, when the server comes back online, it picks
up where it left off. In other words, the server is stateless-meaning it
retains no client state information. If the server crashes before sending
an acknowledgement to the client, the client retransmits when the server
comes up.
   The ability to mount exported file systems lets you centralize all types
of information in common drives and directories. This saves time and
effort, especially when you are working with archives, backups, and general
disaster recovery techniques, such as mirroring or data searching. If you
use a relational database on the network, you can access information
anywhere on the network in seconds.

PC/TCP Plus
FTP's PC/TCP Plus comes complete with option-rich commands and an
impressive collection of networking utilities. PC/TCP Plus offers more
commands, and a more in-depth configuration and operation than the other
products reviewed-at $490 compared to the $665 for the three Sun modules
that give you equal features.
   The drawback to PC/TCP Plus is its complex installation and
configuration procedure. PC/TCP Plus requires the network administrator to
have previous UNIX or NFS knowledge. The documentation doesn't help
matters: We found FTP's manuals to contain many details, but overall, they
were poorly organized.
   PC/TCP Plus is available for both DOS and OS/2 operating systems and
comes with FTP's NFS product, Interdrive. PC/TCP Plus supports both
peer-to-peer and PC-to-multitasking system connections. It supports simple
network management protocol (SNMP), fiber distributed data interface,
point-to-point protocol, serial line internet protocol, X.25, LAN Manager
over Token Ring (IEEE 802.5), TCP/IP over Class 1 Ethernet (DIX), Class 11
Ethernet (IEEE 802.2 and 802.3), and IPX from Netware.
   Configuring PC/TCP Plus relies on two major files: IFCUST.SYS, which
primarily describes hardware and its associated base memory addresses and
interrupt assignments; and IPCUST.SYS, which contains internet protocol
(IP) information and sets preferences and network defaults.

Going Remote
PC/TCP Plus support for remote connections is excellent. Performing a
remote login on a PC/TCP Plus system is remarkably similar to using a UNIX
workstation. Because rsh and rexec are part of PC/TCP Plus' entourage of
utilities, we could use familiar commands to log into other systems.
Conversely, Sun provides only telnet and single-command rsh service.
   Beyond log-in sessions, utilities like rmt (remote tape manipulation),
tar, and ddates give you an excellent way to backup and archive data on the
PC to a network tape drive, optical disk, or file system; and to record
these events for future reference and scheduling. The PC/TCP Plus inet
command is also effective for displaying information about internet control
message protocol statistics, TCP connections, IP routing, and the Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) table if in use.
   The daemon for PC/TCP Plus iscalled ftpserv. The big difference between
ftpserv and Sun's pcnfs daemon is that ftpserv lets you set up a PC to act
as a server. This is a boon for PC users who want to share files between
PCs without going through the UNIX server.
   Included with the PC/TCP Plus package is a copy of the pcnfsd source
code and a makefile file utility to assist with the compilation of code.
The instructions for installing the supplied daemon are vague but
adequate.
   We liked the way PC/TCP Plus uses the available memory on a PC. By
letting you dynamically unload the protocol stack-or other network related
utilities in memory-you can use the memory-resident idrive program without
rebooting the system when you want to turn it off.
   Other PC/TCP Plus commands deserving honorable mention are: rloginvt and
rlogingl, which support up to 10 virtual sessions; smtpsrv, an e-mail
server daemon that lets you use a PC as a mail server or gateway; and rcp,
which lets you set the umask value from the command line. Additionally, FTP
provides an extensive collection of terminal emulators including VT52,
VT100, VT220, and IBM 3270.
   PC/TCP Plus is a diamond in the rough: its installation, configuration,
and operability are not polished. PC administrators will also need to take
a crash course in UNIX basics. However, PC/TCP Plus is an extremely
functional UNIX-like set of network tools for the PC-and it will appeal to
UNIX administrators who have suddenly found PCs in their midst.

PC-NFS
Everyone in the UNIX community who knows networking knows of Sun's PC-NFS.
And, in an attempt to maintain that market position, Sunselect began
shipping PC-NFS for DOS and Microsoft Windows in March.
   We definitely like PC-NFS. It is a well-crafted product and has a decent
Microsoft Windows interface. We would have appreciated a more icon-based
access to some of its utilities, but what you get is exceptionally
well-designed and functional. All in all, PC-NFS is a close runner-up to
FTP's product.
   The base PC-NFS lacks two important features that youdo get with FTP's
PC/TCP Plus. PC-NFS does not support file transfer protocol server
capability for PC-to-PC access. This capability is needed for DOS users on
the UNIX network to transfer files directly to other DOS systems. Without
FTP support, you must store the files you wish to share on the UNIX
server.
   Another shortcoming of the base package is its lack of back-up and
e-mail utilities, although it does have a basic messaging service. You can
boost the usefulness of PC-NFS with two $125 add-on package that, among
other things, give you enhanced mail features and various terminal
emulators.

Solid Software
Despite Sunselect's pricing scheme, the overall PC-NFS environment offers
most of the features you need. The product's well-styled interface and
exceptional documentation also give you a secure feeling that Sun knows PC
users-something you have to wonder about with FTP.
   The DOS version of PC-NFS comes with most of the utilities you would
expect: ftp, telnet, dos2unix, unix2dos, finger, ping, rcp, and rsh, among
others. Noticeably missing is the rlogin utility, and the available rsh
does not support a live login, which leaves telnet as the only login
choice.
   In the Microsoft Windows module, you are greeted with icons labeled Ftp,
Telnet, Netstat, Messaging, and Ping. When you execute any of these, the
familiar character-mode version of the program runs, except for Messaging,
which has a Microsoft Windows interface. We found all the utilities to work
effectively.
   What we really like about the Windows version is its full support for
network drives. The Window File Manager program, for example, prominently
displayed all our network drives at the top of its main window. By clicking
on a drive label, we instantly received a graphical depiction of the
mounted file system on our server. Additionally, the Windows Print Manager
program worked well on our network. PC-NFS printing functions include
high-speed spooling to network printers and the ability to share local PC
printers with other network users. You can also use Windows to access
printers via the Windows control panel.
   PC-NFS uses several memory resident programs (TSRs), including SNMP;
listener, a messaging program; pcnfslpd, a PC print server; and prt.com, a
network printing program.
   Version four of PC-NFS includes the source code, makefile, and
installation scripts for version two of pcnfsd. The earlier pcnfsd daemon,
which is still in widespread use, was designed to provide user
authentication and basic network printing services. The new daemon provides
enhanced printing and user authentication services, as well as support for
Microsoft Windows. Sun provides detailed instructions on installing server
daemons, including compilation instructions for PCNFSD on an IBM RS/6000.
   PC-NFS is a polished, user-friendly product. Its installation and
configuration routines work effectively for users of all levels. The
documentation is well presented. In addition, Sun has done an excellent job
with its support of Microsoft Windows. PC-NFS's list price is too high,
however, and as a result, we think it is best suited for sites just
beginning to install DOS-to-UNIX networking.

3Com TCP
3Com TCP, with 3Com NFS, offers easy installation, good documentation, and
an impressive array of network commands. The product shows versatility by
working with different servers, including TCP/IP, NFS, Novell Netware,
Microsoft LAN Manager, and 3Com's own 3+Open LAN Manager and 3+Share
products.
   The versatility doesn't carry through to 3Com's TCP product,
however-unless you're accustomed to using one of 3Com's server products.
3Com offers many of the same UNIX-like networking commands, but its syntax
for specifying options is unlike UNIX itself.
   3Com TCP with DPA is available for both DOS and OS/2. It offers minimal
terminal support, but we did like its Demand Protocol Architecture (DPA), a
PC memory management feature. With DPA, you can load and unload the network
protocol stacks from memory, which is advantageous when you need to free up
memory for other software, especially if you use memory-resident tools.
   Installation of TCP is easy, but we didn't appreciate the four levels of
subdirectories it creates. We also didn't like the product's assumption
that we had the 3+Open LAN Manager. The software creates this directory if
you choose install option one. If you choose option two, it creates a
directory for the Microsoft LAN Manager. Either directory adds an
unnecessary 43 characters to the system path. At publication time, 3Com
informed us that Version 2.0 of TCP would correct these problems.
   Lastly, we should note TCP runs under Microsoft Windows, but does not
support the nfssetup, ping, arp, and tstat commands. These programs must be
run in one of Microsoft Window's full-screen, character-mod windows. (If
you haven't had the experience, don't look forward to it.)
   3Com's product is most successful in its general functionality, overall
documentation, and compatibility with a wide range of network
configurations and protocols. But we found everything geared more toward a
peer-to-peer network design that emphasizes coexistence with 3+Open LAN
Manager, Microsoft LAN Manager, and Novell Netware.

A Good Marriage
Like a good marriage, the better the underlying mechanism, the smoother the
experience. Right now, with FTP's PC/TCP Plus and Sun's PC-NFS, you can be
sure you're walking to the altar at the right time. We think 3Com's TCP
needs a better UNIX orientation, but current 3Com users should strongly
consider it.
   When it gets to money, matrimony is a matter of bargaining positions.
Each product is sold on a per CPU basis, so multiple copies can be
expensive, especially when compared to DOS products. On this score, even if
you're getting a quantity discount, FTP is sure to score heavily.
   DOS users might get frustrated with FTP's product because of its
command-line orientation and complex configuration, but current UNIX
administrators won't mind. If you're looking for a simple marriage,
consider PC-NFS without prejudice-it's the beginning of an exciting new
interface for NFS.
   FTP's product provides the most extensive collection of commands,
terminal emulators, and networking utilities for command-line shops, and
its DOS server capability is impressive. So if you have the know how, you
won't hear any wedding bell blues.

ITS IN THE CARDS

By:
D.B.

In the PC market, network cards are commodity items. Buying decisions can
boil down to whether or not the vendor includes a T-connector in the box.
We entered this fray to look at three vendors with established reputations
and products: 3Com Corp., Standard Microsystems Corp. (SMC), and Cabletron
Systems Inc.
We compared 16-bit cards rather than 32- or eight-bit cards because they
offer the best combination of compatibility, price, and performance. We
chose Thinnet cable cards for similar reasons: reliability, pricing, and
convenience. We could have chosen 10Base-T, but despite its compact design
and superior convenience, we think Thinnet is a good choice for businesses
with small networks because of its low cost and technical merits.
   We evaluated cards that support the standard PC industry-standard
architecture (ISA) bus, as well as the Microchannel architecture used by
IBM PS/2 systems.
   The 3Com products are sold under the name Etherlink and are our first
pick because they provide the best installation and configuration software.
The downside to the Etherlink cards is they are the most expensive-priced
at $425, compared to the $296 and $249 offerings from Cabletron and SMC.
   The Etherlink 16 supports ISA systems and the EtherlinkMC supports
Microchannel systems. Both cards include a boot ROM socket, 64 kilobytes of
on-board memory, simple network management protocol (SNMP) support, both
thicknet and Thinnet connection, a Thinnet T-connector, and menu-driven
software for installation and configuration. The documentation on
installation, diagnostics, error messages, and trouble shooting is
impressive.
   The limited lifetime warranty for both products covers hardware and
software. Technical support is provided through dealers, Compuserve, fax,
and a telephone hot line.
   The Cabletron cards are called Desktop Network Interface (DNI) and
suffer from poor documentation. Model E2112 supports ISA and model E3112
supports Microchannel. We also learned about several other models in the
documentation because Cabletron crams the descriptions of six cards into a
single manual.
   The DNI cards feature boot ROM, 16 kilobytes of on-board RAM, SNMP
support, and thicknet and Thinnet connections, as well as 10Base-T (RJ-45)
connections. The cards use LEDs to indicate power status, network
collisions, and transmit and receive status. The software comes with Cmail,
an unloadable e-mail utility.
   No automated installation utility comes with the DNI cards, which means
you must copy the appropriate files to your hard drive and edit the system
start-up files. The board can be configured manually using switches and
jumpers, or electronically with the packet driver configuration utility.
   The DNI cards come with a one-year warranty. Free user support is
provided on a toll-free support line. Online support is available through
Compuserve, UNIX e-mail, anonymous FTP, and a 24-hour bulletin board.
   Probably the most popular cards of those we reviewed are SMC's Ethercard
Plus cards, which sell for $249 and $349. The reason these are popular is
SMC purchased the LAN communications business unit of Western Digital Inc.
last year, and Western Digital's name had become synonymous with PC network
cards.
   The Ethercard Plus products-the Elite/16 for ISA systems and the Elite/A
for Microchannel systems-come with the same basic features as the other
products. Both have boot ROM sockets, 16 kilobytes of on-board memory, LEDs
that signal transmit and receive, thicknet and Thinnet connections, and a T
connector. Both cards are also software configurable, but have optional
jumper-based settings.
   SMC has the most reasonably priced card of any major network vendor, and
there is a five-year warranty on the Ethercard Plus products. This is a
nice touch, but all in all, we still prefer the 3Com products because they
provide the best installation and configuration utilities.

MORE APPLE TO UNIX CONNECTIVITY
Uaccess veils UUCP's complexity in a Macintosh e-mail hub

By:
Andrew D. Wolfe Jr.

It's hard to imagine technologies as disparate as the highly usable
Macintosh from Apple Computer Inc. and the obtuse UUCP mail system.
Fortunately, Ice Engineering Inc. has created a complete UUCP system for
the Mac that not only works, but is easy to use-Uaccess ($375) for network
servers, and Uaccesslite ($195) for network clients and standalone
systems.
   With Uaccess, you can easily compose, send, and receive mail on a
Macintosh. Uaccess supports the two common forms of UNIX mail
addressing-domain addressing (user@company.com) and UUCP addressing
(!system1!system2!user). You can have any number of windows open to compose
and read messages. To view a list of messages received, you open a mail
in-box. Each message is marked by a small icon that indicates if the
message is a regular message or a reply, and whether it has been read,
saved to a text file, or marked for deletion.
   Uaccess operates like conventional UUCP by spooling mail and executing
in batch mode after connecting to a remote system, but surprisingly it can
also answer remote UUCP calls in the background, turning the Mac into a
genuine UUCP mail server. This places Uaccess ahead of DOS products such as
UUlink from Vortex Technology (Topanga, Calif.).
   Icons in a floating "Functions" window provide common mail
manipulations, including compose letter, reply, forward, and delete.
Uaccess also supports Usenet news interchange, and lets you review, post,
and follow up articles in a newsgroup in the same way you handle mail.
Uaccess sends and receives files via UUCP. The user identifies source and
target files through a series of dialog boxes and can select raw data, data
with newline translation, and Macbinary formats when sending.
   Uaccess provides numerous file conversion operations, including Stuffit
compression and decompression, Macbinary and Binhex encoding and decoding,
as well as DOS and UNIX conversion. It also provides the uuencode and
uudecode translators used for sending and receiving binary data over UUCP
networks. These translators are omitted from Uaccesslite.
   Uaccess is easy, but tedious, to configure. You face 18 different dialog
boxes, some of which you revisit several times, and it is often difficult
to find the specific option you want. For example, to set the automatic
dial option, you must wind your way through two menus and two dialog boxes.
This causes you to rely heavily on the documentation. Fortunately, the
user's guide is comprehensive and well-indexed.
   Uaccess turns Macintosh computers into full UUCP hosts, and can in fact
implement a local UUCP network among Macintoshes using Appletalk, while
still providing interchange with remote UUCP hosts via modem.
Non-networked, or client-only, Macs can be outfitted with Uaccesslite, but
in order to provide a gateway between Appletalk networks and outside UUCP
systems, you must buy Uaccess.
   Flexible is the most concise way to describe Uaccess. Important
operations have command-key accelerators, but the menus aren't cluttered
accelerator notations. Mail, news, and communications have their own menus
and make the most common functions immediately accessible. Uaccess also
makes use of Apple's "Balloon Help" to provide information about menus,
icons, and dialog boxes. Uaccess also you to customize your mail operations
by attaching other programs to it.
   All in all, Uaccess is a solid product that turns a Mac network into a
full e-mail system that supports UUCP. You cannot use Uaccess to send
graphics, as some Mac mail systems do, but Uaccess is nonetheless an
excellent way to achieve connectivity between Apple Macintosh and UNIX
systems.

icons to show the status of each mail message.

LOW-COST GRAPHICS FOR THE MASSES
The Maxstation is a cheap way for four users to access text and
graphics-based programs on a SCO UNIX system

By:
Rick Farris

It's a common problem-how do you network your accounting department or
secretarial pool without diving into a Novell Inc. network? Priced at $795
for the central controller, plus $199 for each user module, Maxstation from
Maxpeed Corp. provides powerful incentive to choose the UNIX option.
   At $1,595 for a controller card and four base units, a fully configured
Maxstation controller gives four users access to The Santa Cruz Operation's
Open Desktop. You do have to settle for 720-by348-pixel monochrome
graphics, however. And count on spending another $200 per user for
keyboard, monitor, and mouse. We found the aesthetics of a green-screen X
display to be questionable, but the ability to display graphics means that
WYSIWYG word processing and simple graphics are available for the same
price as an ASCII terminal. At publication time, Maxpeed was also slated to
ship a cover VGA model.
   The Maxstation consists of a controller card that fits in your computer
and up to four base units that resemble a terminal base. Up to four
controllers can be installed in each computer for a total of 16 Maxstation
users. Each base unit has connections for a keyboard, monitor, mouse, and
parallel printer-all of which you supply. The mouse port is a
general-purpose buffered serial port and can also be used to attach a
modem, scanner, plotter, or even a traditional terminal.
   Perfectly good terminals can be purchased for $400 or less, but the
Maxstation has one feature that terminals can't match-graphics. Because the
Maxstation emulates console graphics and uses PC keyboards, applications
work exactly as they do on the console monitor. For instance, using SCO's
DOS emulator, a DOS version of Wordperfect Corp.'s Wordperfect can be run
on the Maxstation, complete with graphical print-preview and function- and
alt-key support.
   What makes the pricing of the Maxstation so attractive is that it
includes the cost of the multiport serial card that would be required to
connect terminals to your system. Viewed in that light, an incremental cost
of $300 per user for graphics and full console support is outstanding. You
hook up base units with twisted-pair wire. The maximum distance a base unit
can be located from the controller is 400 feet.
   The Maxstation does have its shortcomings. Unlike its competitors-Fiber
Optic Station by Sun River Corp. (Austin, Texas) and The Unterminal from
Advanced Micro Research Inc. (San Jose, Calif.)-the Maxstation provides
only Hercules-compatible (720-by-348 pixel) monochrome graphics. And if
you're not running an SCO product, you can forget about the Maxstation. It
is only available for SCO's UNIX, XENIX/386, and Open Desktop. The
Maxstation also requires that you provide your own keyboard ($50 to $100)
and monochrome monitor ($75 to $100). Maxpeed also offers a $1,495
Maxstation with eight ports to service 32 users.
   One of the Maxstation's selling points is that it runs Open Desktop on a
regular monochrome monitor. In our tests, it worked as advertised, but
don't plan having on more than two or three users use Open Desktop at the
same time. Each user runs a copy of the X server and the Motif window
manager, and running three copies of each brings a 486 to its knees. On the
other hand, on a 33-MHz 386 equipped with 16 megabytes of RAM, four
Maxstations easily ran Wordperfect in character mode.
   The Maxstation is a good, inexpensive way to connect an accounting
department running multiuser financial software or a medium-sized
word-processing department. Management information systems managers in
these markets will be pleased with the Maxstation. Those looking for a
cheap replacement for X terminals need to keep looking, because several X
sessions create too big a drain on the central computer. But the Maxstation
is a character-mode champ, by all means.

THE POWER OF POSIX THINKING
How to simplify porting to the portable system interface

By:
John Sovereign

Posix, the portable operating system interface for computer environments,
is the combined effort of several groups that want to standardize the
interface of the UNIX operating system. Posix pulls together the /usr/group
Standard, the X/Open Company's Portability Guide (XPG) System Interface
(XSI), and AT&T Computer Systems' System V Interface Definition (SVID).
Posix is also one of the few subjects that the open systems consortia, the
Open Software Foundation (OSF) and UNIX International, agree on.
   The Posix interface is even appearing on non-UNIX systems, including
Digital Equipment Corp.'s VMS and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s MPE. Its popularity
is due, in part, to its adoption by the U.S. government as Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) number 151-1. The Posix system
interface is also the cornerstone of the federal government's Application
Portability Profile. In the spring of 1991, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) started certifying vendors' systems as
Posix-compliant. The system interface has also been adopted by the
International Standards Organization (ISO) as document 9945-1.
   For software developers, the result of all this activity is a
platform-independent programming interface designed to support application
portability. I will describe some of the new Posix system interfaces that
may differ from the interfaces you are familiar with, and show you how to
make C-language applications more portable by using the new Posix
interfaces.

The Royal Family of Portability
Posix is actually a family of standards that has been under development by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a
professional organization that promotes standards for hardware and
software, since 1985. The Posix activities are designated as IEEE Project
1003. The base operating system interface is the first standard completed
by the Posix committees and is referred to as 1003.1, or Posix.1. Other
standards currently in progress address networking services, security,
real-time extensions, and administration.
   The Posix.1 interfaces are currently described as C language functions
and header files. There are Ada and Fortran versions of the Posix.1
interfaces as well as a language-independent description that is currently
under development. Along with a C language-dependent addendum, this
language-independent version should replace the current, C-centric standard
without changing the semantics of the interfaces described.
   Posix.1 does not require that the C programming environment provided by
an implementation comply with the ANSI/ISO C standard. Nor do the function
interfaces and header files depend on any additions to the language
invented by the C standard. Several of the C library functions defined by
Posix.1 are the subject of the C standard, but the majority are based on
historical implementations-System V and BSD, for example-and are not
required to provide standard C behavior unless the implementation claims to
conform to the C standard as well as Posix.1.
   The operating system interfaces described in Posix.1 serve as the base
for the most recent versions of the application programming interfaces
(APIs) developed by the open systems consortia: the XPG, SVID, and OSF's
Application Environment Specification. Each of these documents describes
additional services outside the scope of Posix.1, but many are undergoing
standardization at IEEE and elsewhere.

Using the Posix.1 Interface
The good news is, like any good standard, Posix.1 is based on existing
practice, and borrows functionality from System V Release 3 (SVR3) and
recent releases of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Therefore,
most application code that runs on any of the various flavors of UNIX
already conforms to the standard.
   The Posix.1 standard is organized into 10 chapters or sections. The
first section provides an introduction and defines general terms used in
the standard; the second defines terminology and global constants used to
describe the system services. The remaining eight sections describe
functional interfaces. Most of the work done by the Posix.1 committee was
necessary to resolve conflicts between the different flavors of UNIX, or to
provide backward compatibility where defects in the historical designs
required changes. There are a few areas where the standard doesn't match
any existing interface. These are: Signal Mechanisms, Sessions and Job
Control, and Terminal I/O Interfaces.
   Before addressing these areas in more detail, I want to introduce
another important invention from the Posix.1 committee: the conformance
document. Earlier standards did not require vendors to describe the details
of their implementations, but Posix.1 defines such a document and its
content.

Using the Posix.1 Conformance Document
Reading standards documents is like reading ballot propositions-the
language is legalistic, stilted, and full of jargon and loopholes. An
important aid is a conformance document. The Posix.1 standard requires
system vendors to provide conformance documents to programmers and other
laypersons. A vendor's Posix conformance document (PCD) must describe the C
language environment provided by the implementation, other optional
features, and the behavior of the system which the standard allows to be
implementation-defined. While this information should be included in a
vendor's system documentation, the PCD should also be available from the
vendor as a standalone document.
   For example, Posix.1 does not require that implementations support a
process' membership in multiple groups. This aspect is borrowed almost
verbatim from the functionality introduced by BSD. The C-preprocessor
constant NGROUPSMAX defines the number of groups to which a process may
belong; an implementation must provide the value of this constant in the
header file <limits.h> and in the PCD. FIPS 151-1 requires that NGROUPSMAX
be greater than eight. Posix.1 also provides the function sysconf to allow
applications to query the value of this and other system limits at
run-time.
   If your application needs to use multiple groups to provide multiple
levels of security, it does not strictly conform to Posix.1, but may still
be a "conforming application" if you provide information that describes
this dependency to users. Armed with PCDs from competing system vendors,
you and your customers can determine which systems can support your
application.
   Similarly, Posix.1 does not require that a system limit file names to a
particular length. But the standard does require all implementations to
support file names of at least 14 bytes and to advertise the maximum number
supported in the PCD, programmatically in the pathconf interface, and the
constant NAMEMAX defined in the header file <limits.h>, if the maximum
number is fixed for all file systems supported by the implementation. Other
limits may vary due to system configuration and, therefore, may be excluded
from the header file. You must use the sysconf or pathconf functions at
run-time for these limits.
   In this case, if your application requires functionality greater than
that required by the standard-you need to represent file names up to 32
bytes-Posix.1 does not consider this significant enough to warrant
exception to the requirements of a conforming application. Your application
should determine if the limitation exists on the platform it is running on
and provide a suitable work-around.
   The first thing you need to know from a vendor's PCD is how to compile
your application in the system's Posix environment. Because most Posix
implementations are based on existing systems, the default application
environment is probably designed to be compatible with older applications
and may not be Posix compliant. On such a system, requesting the Posix
application environment may be as simple as adding another library to the
command line that you use to invoke the compiler or linker. Accessing the
Posix environment should be one of the first subjects addressed in a PCD.

Signals
Posix signals are based largely on BSD's signal delivery and receipt
mechanisms. The principal advantage of the BSD model is reliable reception
of signals: the signal catching function is not required to "re-arm"
itself, which avoids a potential race condition with another occurrence of
the same signal. Posix.1 changed the names of the BSD interfaces to protect
existing applications which might depend on minor semantic changes. Posix
signal functions and analogues in the BSD model are listed in Table 1.
   Posix has introduced a new function, sigpending, which identifies the
signals currently blocked from delivery and pending for the calling
process.
   All signal functions may operate on one or more signals by using a set
of signals defined by the type sigsett. These signal sets have historically
been implemented as a simple integral bit mask, manipulated by a single
macro, sigmask. To support potentially more complex implementations,
Posix.1 introduced a group of functions to manipulate signal sets:
sigemptyset, sigfillset, sigaddset, sigdelset, and sigismember.
   An application must initialize any signal set with sigemptyset or
sigfillset to allow flexibility in the definition of sigsett, and
compatibility with signals not defined by Posix.1. If an implementation
defines additional signals, they may not be present in a signal set that
was initiated by sigfillset.
   For example, your application may attempt to ignore all known signals by
using code similar to the following fragment:
   for (i = 1; i < NSIG; i++)
   signal(i, SIGIGN);
   Unfortunately, this code is not Posix.1-compliant for two reasons.
First, the constant NSIG is not part of the standard. If it is necessary to
operate on all Posix.1 signals at once, the sigfillset function should be
used. Second, the signal function is not required by the Posix.1 standard.
The signal function is defined by the C standard, but it may not be built
on a reliable mechanism on some implementations.
   If you wish to avoid using the more complex sigaction interface, there
is a solution: provide your own signal interface based on sigaction. A
suitable implementation is provided in Listing 1, which, strictly speaking,
should be named something other than signal. The code uses a standard C
function prototype.
   Regarding NSIG: a portable application cannot make assumptions about the
underlying implementation of sigsett. One method for achieving the same
utility in a Posix.1 application is to block all signals from delivery. The
function sigprocmask sets, modifies, and accesses the set of signals that
is currently blocked by the calling process.
   Signal blocking is another feature of the BSD model that was not present
in early versions of System V. A block prevents a signal from being
delivered, but if the signal is later unblocked, it will be delivered. In
other words, the occurrence of a blocked signal is "remembered," and an
ignored signal is forgotten.
   While the signal set type and support routines provide more flexibility,
they complicate the process of porting code based on the BSD interfaces.
The small program in Listing 2 executes two processes that catch and send
signals to each other using the Posix and historical BSD interfaces.
   On lines 8, 27 and 51 of Listing 2, the macro POSIXSOURCE is used to
distinguish between these two interfaces. This macro is used by the Posix.1
standard to control name space pollution: it must be defined by
Posix-conforming applications before the inclusion of Posix header files.
When this macro is defined, the implementation must ensure that only the
interfaces defined by Posix.1 and standard C are visible to an application
program.
   If the program in Listing 2 was intended to be used only in Posix.1
environments, to ensure that the proper name space is used, you would
include the following macro definition at the very beginning of
the program:
   #ifndef POSIXSOURCE
   #define POSIXSOURCE
   #endif
The macro is conditionally defined because an implementation's C compiler
may predefine it as a courtesy. There is no specification in Posix.1 of the
value of this constant.
   Note the initialization of the signal set using the function sigemptyset
on line 30 of Listing 2, and its use with sigaction and sigsuspend on lines
40 and 52, respectively. Also note the use of the type pidt as the return
value from the functions fork and getppid. In the BSD implementation on
lines 11-13, the type of the signal catcher's return value has changed from
void to int. The structure and function sigvec will be substituted for
sigaction, and the type int substituted for pidt.

Sessions and Job Control
While Posix.1 has formalized the notion of sessions, this concept was based
largely on the job control model introduced by BSD: a user interacts with a
command shell or other "job control-aware" application during a terminal
session, which may create and transfer control to different jobs, or
process groups. In earlier versions of System V, each session corresponded
to a single process group.
   There is only one active, or foreground, process group at any one time
in each session. If there is a terminal device associated with a
session-the controlling terminal-the foreground process group has complete
access to the terminal and receives signals from the terminal interface
generated by user input, such as interrupt and suspend.
   Posix.1 was forced to resolve the name conflict between the System V and
BSD definition of the function setpgrp. Semantics similar to the former and
latter are provided by the Posix functions setsid and setpgid,
respectively. The setsid function creates a new session. The calling
process has no controlling terminal and becomes the leader of this new
session and a new process group. Within its current session, the setpgid
function allows a process to join another process group or create its
own-this Posix function has more restrictions than the BSD implementation
of setpgrp.
   Because most applications do not need to be aware of job-control signals
and operations, the Posix.1 committee decided to make provision of this
functionality optional. Unless your application requires job control, it
should be prepared for a system that doesn't support it. On such a system,
the functions setpgid, tcgetpgrp, and tcsetpgrp may fail with the global
error indicator errno, set to ENOSYS. In addition, sending or attempting to
catch or block one of the following signals will return an error: SIGCHLD,
SIGCONT, SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, and SIGTTOU.
   If your application is a "job-control" shell, you should read the
detailed advice contained in the definition of the term in the rationale of
the standard.
   Remote terminal connections or file transfer programs need to be
concerned with sessions. These applications want an asynchronous device to
become their controlling terminal, so that the hang-up signal will be
received when the line is dropped. Unfortunately, Posix.1 did not
standardize a mechanism for processes to gain a new controlling terminal.
   For most processes this is not a problem because they simply inherit
their controlling terminal from their parent. The first device opened by a
new session leader, typically the getty/login process, traditionally became
the controlling terminal for the process. While Posix.1 "blessed" this
behavior, it does not require it-user login was deemed an administrative
function outside the scope of this standard.
   As mentioned earlier, a session may lack a controlling terminal; this is
desirable for programs, such as daemons, that operate in the background and
should not be affected by user actions at terminals. The setsid function is
a simple interface to use for this capability. Daemons must still
frequently send messages, especially errors, to some terminal device, such
as the system console, however.
   Although the Posix.1 committee was reluctant to specify a mechanism to
acquire a new controlling terminal, the standard provides a facility for
daemons that doesn't compromise the application's detachment from the
control of a terminal. A new flag, ONOCTTY, that prevents the device being
opened from becoming the calling process' controlling terminal, has been
defined for the open function. The following code segment demonstrates the
relevant steps to set up a Posix.1 daemon's error output:
   (void) setsid();
   fd = open("/dev/console",
    ORDWR ONOCTTY);
   Because a Posix system is not required to provide a special file name
"/dev/console/", this is not strictly conforming code.

Terminal I/O
The general-purpose ioctl function has been replaced by a number of
context-specific services (see Table 2). System V did not support job
control before Posix.1 was incorporated in Release 4. The ioctl arguments
that correspond to the job control-related functions, tcgetpgrp and
tcsetpgrp, are taken from BSD.
   The termios data structure is manipulated by the tcgetattr and tcsetattr
routines. The name has been changed from the System V structure, termio, to
protect innocent applications on implementations that provide a
backward-compatible terminal I/O interface.
   Listing 3 shows an application that supports rudimentary, line-oriented,
user input, and invokes the terminal I/O interface to ensure that
characters are "erased" when the keyboard erase character is received. To
demonstrate the relationships in Table 2, the Posix.1 interfaces are
invoked using macros that call ioctl, which could be used in an older,
non-compliant System V environment.
   In addition to the ioctl replacement routines, another set of routines
has been created to manipulate the baud rate stored in the termios
structure. The routines-cfgetispeed, cfgetospeed, cfsetispeed, and
cfsetospeed-get and set the input and output baud rates, respectively.
Terminal baud rates are represented using an unsigned integral type,
speedt, defined in <termios.h>. Listing 4 demonstrates how you might set
the line speed to 2400 baud in a Posix.1 and an old System V application.
You must set both the input and output speeds, because an implementation
may support split rates under Posix.1.
   The use of the function tcgetattr is important to establish the initial
settings of the termios structure. This is the only portable way to modify
the terminal settings, because an implementation may include additional
fields in the termios structure and may require certain values in those
fields. Systems compatible with older System V applications may provide a
field that determines which line discipline will be enforced. Portable
Posix.1 applications should not attempt to build termios structures from
scratch.

Further Reading
I have covered the highlights of the Posix.1 interface and reviewed in some
detail the major changes in Posix.1, including signal mechanisms,
job-control, and terminal I/O interfaces. A more complete analysis of the
standard's impact is included in two books published last year: The Posix.1

ALIGNING COLUMNS, AGING PARAGRAPHS, AND NETWORK TIME PROTOCOL

By:
Dr. Rebecca Thomas

Tom Barron provides a filter handy for aligning columnar data separated by
spaces and tabs. Larry Ruane contributes a program that ages, and
eventually expires, paragraph-oriented items in a text file, which
administrators might find useful for automatically eliminating entries from
the message-of-the-day file. Ed Vielmetti introduces NTP, or network time
protocol, in response to my February 1992 request for time-service
information. Enjoy.

Ducks in a Row
Dear Dr. Thomas:
My submission aligns text into columns, and consists of two nawk programs
with a shell wrapper to invoke them Listing 1A. The first instance of nawk
determines the maximum width of each input field and the second uses that
information to align the fields. String data is left-justified and numeric
fields are right-justified within the field width. User-specified
intercolumn spacing can be used to override the default value of two
spaces. The nawk programs assume that input fields are separated by blanks
and/or tabs.
Tom Barron
Nashville, Tenn.

Part A of Listing 1 provides the align program, Part B some sample input,
and Part C the output produced by align. In this case, you see one
shortcoming: the last "logical" field titled "Mounted on" is treated as two
separate fields-thus the minus sign placeholders at the ends of the
remaining lines.
   I find align especially useful when I have tabulated data and want to
convert the tabs to spaces. Generally, if you convert each tab character to
some number of spaces, even if it's eight, the columnar alignment is thrown
off. However, align does a nice job of lining up the result.
   Explanation of align operation. Line 6 is the dormant debugging
directive documented in my April 1992 column. Line 7 defines the default
intercolumn spacing to be two spaces, and Line 8 defines the correct usage
message for invoking align.
   Lines 10-22 process command-line arguments. The "case" construct on
lines 10-15 checks the argument count. If zero, nothing needs to be done.
If one, line 12 assigns the supplied argument to the Spacing variable. More
than one argument is a usage error, so line 13 reports the transgression
and the script terminates. Lines 17-22 check to make sure that the value
assigned to the Spacing variable is numeric. If not, line 21 issues the
correct usage message and terminates the script.
   Line 25 sets a trap to erase the temporary files whenever the script
exits normally or is interrupted by a signal. The first nawk program (lines
27-47) scans its standard input, writes a copy to a temporary file for
subsequent processing, and creates another temporary file containing the
maximum width of each field found in the input. The second nawk program
(lines 49-89) uses the field-width data to process the temporary file
containing a copy of the standard input.
   Line 29 splits each input line into array word on field separator blank,
which corresponds to space or tab characters. If line 30 detects that the
field count for the input line is greater than the current maximum, line 31
updates maxcount with the new value. Line 33 prints the input line to
standard output, which is redirected to the align$$out temporary file by
line 47. Using $$-the process-id of the shell running the align
script-makes the temporary file name unique.
   Lines 35-39 determine the maximum width of each input field: line 35
scans each input field; if line 36 detects that the current field width is
greater than the maximum width seen so far, the maximum width value is
updated by line 37. The END-pattern action (lines 41-46) creates the width
file: line 42 generates the unique name of the temporary width file (procid
contains the process-id of the shell running the program, which was passed
to nawk on its invocation line, line 47); line 43 scans each field; line 44
writes the maximum width of the corresponding field to the width file; and
finally, line 46 writes a newline.
   The BEGIN-pattern action of the second nawk program (lines 50-54) reads
the width file and places the values into the width array. The main portion
of the program (lines 55-89) reads the input data stored in the temporary
file using input redirection specified on line 89. Line 56 splits each
field of an input line into a word array. Then the "for" loop encompassing
lines 57-87 scans each field, assuming up to maxcount fields.
   Lines 58-86 specify a series of if-else clauses to determine the type of
data in the input field, which is handled accordingly:
-- If the field begins with zero (0), it is treated as the number zero, so
a field containing 0% isn't treated as a string.
-- Else, if the field is empty, insert a placeholder (a minus sign is
used).
-- Else, if the field evaluates numerically to zero value, treat it as a
string. With nawk, zero added to a string gives zero.
-- Else, treat it as a number.

Lines 58-65 handle a special numerical case: If line 58 determines that the
first character is a zero, then lines 59-60 print spaces to right-justify
the field contents within the maximum field width; line 62 outputs the
field value; and lines 63-65 add the intercolumn spacing.
   Lines 66-71 handle the empty field case: if line 66 determines that the
field is empty, then line 67 prints a minus sign (-) placeholder, and lines
68-71 add intercolumn spacing.
   Lines 72-77 handle the case in which the field contains a string value:
if line 72 determines that zero added to the field value is zero, then the
field was a string; if so, line 73 outputs the string and lines 74-77
output spaces to left-justify the string within the maximum field width.
   Lines 78-85 handle the default case, in which the field contains a
number. If so, lines 79-81 output spaces to right-justify the number; line
82 outputs the numerical value; and lines 83-85 add the intercolumn
spacing. Finally, line 88 writes the newline end-of-line terminator.
   Portability Note. For some versions of nawk, the value of a variable
defined on its invocation command line isn't accessible within the
BEGIN-pattern action. For such a case use the approach shown in Listing
1D.

Aging Items
Dear Dr. Thomas:
Most UNIX systems display the file /etc/motd at the start of each log-in
session. This "message-of-the-day" file typically contains announcements of
general interest to the users of that system. A common problem with
/etc/motd is that the notices become obsolete. Users become annoyed-or
worse, confused-when they see an announcement on Monday that the machine
will be rebooted on Sunday, the previous day. Furthermore, users may
eventually ignore all messages if some become dated. System administrators
bear the burden of removing items from /etc/motd at the right time.
   The following filter Listing 2A uses either the new or old version of
awk to "age" items in a text file. An "item" is zero or more blank lines,
followed by one or more non-blank lines, optionally followed by a line of
the form expire integer. Here, integer is a "time-to-live" count for the
associated item.
   If the expire line exists, and the time-to-live count is zero, the item
is discarded and not written to the standard output. If the time-to-live
count is not zero, the script writes out the item and then the expire line,
where the time-to-live count has been reduced by one. An item with no
expire line is written out unconditionally because it never expires.
   We use cron to invoke our filter to age items in /etc/motd every morning
at 1:30 a.m. see Listing 2B. Our entry changes the directory containing the
message-of-the-day file, then runs age and stores the result in a new file,
nmotd. Then we rename that file to motd so it will be displayed when a user
logs in. We use the && shell connective so the rename is only done if the
age program exits successfully.
   Explanation of age operation. The first "if" clause (lines 6-14) detects
a legal expire line. If the time remaining in the second field ($2) is
non-zero, each line in this item is printed by lines 8-9, followed by
another expire line with a reduced time-to-live count ($2 - 1).
   The program takes advantage of awk's built-in NR, for record number,
variable, which is initially zero and is automatically incremented before
each line is read. By resetting this variable at appropriate times, NR
actually holds the line number of the current item, rather than the line
count for the entire input file.
   The second "if" clause (lines 15-19) detects the first line of a new
item when the previous item did not end with an expire line. The previous
item is written out by lines 16-17. Line 18 resets NR to one (1) ready for
the next line, if any, for the item, and line 20 stores the current input
line in the current item array, item.
   If the last item in the file doesn't have an expire line, the
END-pattern action on lines 23-26 prints the item.
Lawrence M. Ruane
Naperville, Ill.

Listing 2C shows a sample section from the /etc/profile script file that
displays the message-of-the-day file for accounts that use the Bourne or
Korn shell as their log-in shell. I replaced the cat command, normally used
to display /etc/motd, with an egrep command invoked to display anything
except the expire-directive lines. The regular expression pattern is
matched by all lines that begin with the string "expire" followed by one or
more space or tab characters, which are in the "empty" square brackets,
followed by one or more decimal integers. The -v option directs egrep to
display every line that doesn't match its pattern argument.

Introducing NTP
Dear Dr. Thomas:
In response to your request for information on alternative time services,
here is some information on NTP, which is used to provide a distributed
time service for the Internet. A number of systems around the Net have
directly attached radio clocks, and these servers use NTP to send out the
time to campus or network-wide time servers that in turn distribute the
time to individual user workstations.
   You can get online information about NTP via anonymous FTP from the
Internet host louie.udel.edu (128.175.1.3). Look in the tree starting with
the /pub/ntp directory. The file /pub/ntp/doc/clock.txt contains an amazing
amount of information on time-code receivers, NTP time servers, and other
details. The protocol itself is documented in the Request for Comments
(RFC) publication number 1129, titled "Internet Time Synchronization: the
Network Time Protocol," and available as a compressed Postscript file,
/pub/ntp/doc/rfc1129.ps.Z.
   If your system or local-area network has a direct connection to the
Internet, you can use the "ntp" software found in the /pub/ntp/ntp.3.4
directory or the "xntp" software found in the /pub/ntp/xntp directory.
Either package will get you in sync once you have located a nearby server
that can provide you with the time. If you're not directly connected to the
Internet, it's still possible to use this software to keep good clocks. One
way is to build or buy your own radio receiver. Another is to use a time
service such as the NIST ACTS dial-up service described in the February
1992 issue. The clock.txt file noted above has these details.
   A mailing list, ntp@trantor.umd.edu (to get on the list send requests to
ntp-request@trantor.umd.edu) covers NTP, and comp.protocols.time.ntp, a
Usenet newsgroup, is connected to the mailing list by a gateway.
   NTP is designed to distribute time information in a large, diverse
internetworked system operating at speeds from mundane to lightwave. It
uses a returnable-time architecture in which a distributed subnetwork of
time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical, master-slave
configuration synchronizes the subnet's local clocks to national time
standards via wire or radio. The servers can also redistribute time
information within a network using local routing algorithms and time
daemons.
   The architectures, algorithms, and protocols that have evolved to NTP
over several years of implementation and refinement are also described in
the RFC. The synchronization subnet has been in regular operation on the
Internet for the last several years. It is described along with performance
data that shows that time-keeping accuracy throughout most portions of the
Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few tens of milliseconds,
even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers, or
networks.

DATA TYPES, FILE TYPES, CONNECT WITH THE DOT

By:
Ray Swartz

To lead off this month, Bob Neuberger asks how to determine the data type
of shell variables. Actually, shell variables don't have data types, but I
review arithmetic operations using the various shells. William Pinard wants
to know if the C shell has an equivalent for the Bourne and Korn shells'
"dot" command. I explain the source command. Finally, Pat Concannon asks
how to add new file types to the file command, and I provide an example of
how to do so.

What's Your Type
Question: Is there a way to determine the data type of a shell variable?
Bob Neuberger
Santa Clara, Calif.

Answer: The quick answer is that shell variables only store characters and
that no numeric variables are provided by either the Bourne, C, or Korn
shells. This appears to contradict the fact that both the Korn and C shells
supply operators for performing arithmetic manipulations on variables, but
the arithmetic operators only work on shell variables that hold numeric
characters, that is, digits zero to nine.
   The Bourne shell has no built-in numeric operators and relies completely
on the expr command. The C and Korn shells offer special built-in
arithmetic commands, but they only work on integers.
   The Bourne shell only handles character data, and no facilities are
provided to deal with numeric data. If you want to add, subtract, multiply,
divide, or take a modulo, you can use expr. In fact, a common Bourne shell
programming command is a='expr $a + 1', which executes the expr command to
add one to the current value stored in a. The shell then assigns expr's
output into a. The expr command fails if one of the arguments in an
arithmetic statement is non-numeric, which includes non-integer values.
   The C shell takes a different approach by providing two different
variable assignment operators: set and @. The set command is used to assign
values to character variables, and @ is used to assign the result of both
arithmetic and bitwise operations to a variable.
   The operators that can be used with @ are addition (+), subtraction (-),
multiplication (*), division (/), modulo (%), right shift (>>), left shift
(<<), one's complement (), bitwise or (), bitwise exclusive or (), bitwise
and (&), increment (++), and decrement (--). Personally, I've never needed
to use bitwise operators inside a shell script, but the C shell makes them
available. According to the C Shell Field Guide, by Gail and Paul Anderson
(Prentice-Hall, 1986), the number of bits used to represent a shell
variable is usually the word size of the underlying computer (16 or 32
bits).
   Even though the C shell has numeric operators, the results are stored as
character digits. Thus, rotating a value to the left 10 times won't change
the number of bits used, but will require more characters to represent the
value. For example, if set a = 3478 and @ b = ( $a << 10 ), then b holds
3561472. Incidentally, you have to put the expression $a << 10 inside
parentheses to avoid confusion, because << is also a shell redirection
metacharacter.
   To demonstrate how these operators work, I've written the mkbits C shell
script, which takes a number as an argument and then creates the
corresponding bit pattern used to represent that value. The mkbits script
is shown in Listing 1A. Listing 1B shows mkbits in action.
   Current versions of the Korn shell (after June 3, 1986) offer the same
arithmetic and bitwise operators as the C shell. Like the C shell, the Korn
shell has a separate command for assigning the result of an arithmetic or
bitwise operation to variables. The Korn shell uses let or double
parentheses. Thus, let a=a+3 adds three to the current value of a. This can
also be written ((a=a+3)). Note that a $ is not required in front of
variable names in let or ((..)) statements. The Korn shell equivalent to
the mkbits script is shown in Listing 1C.
   The Korn shell has an additional numeric feature, the typeset command,
which lets you assign attributes to your variables. Using typeset you can
create integer variables with the command typeset -i variable-name. Trying
to assign a non-integer to such a variable will result in an error. This is
the only instance where a shell variable has a data type.

Going to the Source
Question: I often need to execute one of our script files that sets a
number of environment variables. Under the Bourne and Korn shells, I can
use the command ../filename, which executes the file's commands as part of
the current process. This is required to make the environment variable
definitions accessible.
Is there a C shell equivalent to the Bourne and Korn shell's dot command?
Attempting this under the C shell gives a "Permission Denied" error.
William Pinard
Ann Arbor, Mich.

Answer: The C shell was designed to have built-in commands that are
completely incompatible with those of the Bourne shell, which greatly
reduces the problems associated with having both Bourne and C shell scripts
on the same system. In most cases, the C shell fails if it executes a
Bourne shell script. The same is true if a C shell script is run by the
Bourne shell.
   This is the reason why the dot command doesn't work in the C shell. The
C shell uses the source command instead. Thus, instead of ../filename, use
source ./filename.
   A related point is why you get the "Permission denied" error message
when the C shell doesn't recognize the dot command. In this case, the C
shell sees the dot as the relative path name of the command you want to
run. Because dot is a legal file name, the C shell tries to execute your
current directory, but fails with the "Permission denied" message.
   Incidentally, because of the Bourne/C shell incompatibilities, you can't
source a file that contains Bourne shell export commands. The C shell
doesn't use the export command and if it sees it, an error will result. To
set up environmental variables in the C shell, use the setenv command. The
syntax is setenv environment-variable value. Note that no equal sign is
used in the setenv command. As an example of usage, the command setenv TERM
ansi sets the TERM environment variable to ansi.

Marking Your Territory
Question: As part of an internal application, we've created a number of
custom data files. I'd like to make the file command aware of them. Is
there a way to do that?
Pat Concannon
Chicago, Ill.

Answer: The file command examines the first 512 bytes of a file and tries
to identify what kind of file it is. It correctly handles directories,
executable files, shell scripts, and ASCII files. The key to it is the
/etc/magic file.
   The /etc/magic file has four tab-separated fields. The first field is an
integer offset into the file where you want the command to examine
something.
   Field two is what you want file to examine. Your choices are byte,
short, long, and string. The types byte, short, and long may be followed by
an & and a mask value that is applied before the actual file comparison is
made.
   Field three is the value to use in identifying the file type. This can
be a number (octal values are preceded by 0 and hex values by 0x) or a
string (C escape sequences allowed), which can be preceded by an optional
test operator. The allowed test operators are =, <, and >. The = operator
is the default.
   Field four is the message to print if the described test is valid. In
most cases, it is a string that describes what kind of file has been found.
However, you can use a printf-style format string and the value found in
the file will be substituted for any format specifiers (%d, %o, %x, %c, %s,
etc.) in the format string.
   If you need to perform several tests on a file to identify its type
exactly, you can add more tests by placing a > as the first character on a
line. This tells file to continue testing.
   Listing 2A shows a line I added to my /etc/magic file that identifies
files with RAY as the first three characters. Such files are identified as
"Ray's files." Listing 2B demonstrates that test.
   If file can't identify the type of file based on the tests in
/etc/magic, it uses an internal set of heuristics to guess the "language"
of the file. The guesses are based on the character frequencies and if the
file is executable. These guesses are often wrong.

Going to the Dump
In response to the questions about hot keys, Patrick Combet, of Noisy Le
Grand Cedex, France, suggests a method for reading keys off the keyboard
without using C code. His solution is to use dd to read the keyboard after
setting the terminal to raw mode with stty. His approach is shown in
Listing 3. He notes in his letter that the redirection of dd's standard
error is to suppress dd's "blocks in, blocks out" message.

LISTING 1: The C shell provides several arithmetic and bitwise operators
that can be used in shell scripts.
A. The mkbits script converts numbers into their bit patterns:
1  #! /bin/csh
2  if ( $#argv ) then # any arguments?
3  set nbr = $argv1
4  else
5  echo "Usage: $0 Number"
6  exit 1
7  endif
8  set bitpattern # initialize pattern to empty
9  set cntr = 1 # initalize counter
10 while ( $cntr != 0 ) # at end of bits?
11 @ result = ($nbr & $cntr) # test single bit
12 @ cntr = ($cntr << 1) # increment tester
13 if ( $result ) then # bit set?
14 set bitpattern = 1$bitpattern # yes
15 else
16 set bitpattern = 0$bitpattern # no
17 endif
18 end
19 echo $bitpattern
20 exit 0

B. The mkbits script in action:
% mkbits 3478
00000000000000000000110110010110
% mkbits 3561472
00000000001101100101100000000000
%

C. The Korn shell version of mkbits:
1  case $# in
2  1) b=$1 ;;
3  *) echo "Usage: $0 Number"
4  exit 1 ;;
5  esac
6  a=1 # initalize counter
7  while $a != 0 # at end of bits?
8  do
9  ((c=b&a)) # test single bit
10 ((a=a<<1)) # increment tester
11 if $c -ne 0 ; then # bit set?
12 bitpattern=1$bitpattern # yes
13 else
14 bitpattern=0$bitpattern # no
15 fi
16 done
17 echo $bitpattern
18 exit 0

LISTING 2: You can identify files using the file command and its data
file, /etc/magic.
A. An entry that, when added to /etc/magic,causes the file command to
recognize files beginning with the string "RAY" as "Ray's files":
0 string RAY Ray's file

B. The file command finds Ray's file:
$ cat file.test
RAY
$ file file.test
file.test Ray's file
$

LISTING 3: Reading the keyboard without waiting for return using dd.
stty raw
x='dd bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null'
stty -raw

x now set to single character entered

HOW TO BUILD X TERMINALS AND COOPERATION

LSI Logic Corp. has come out with a dual-purpose board called the Racer X
Evaluation Board, targeting original equipment manufacturers interested in
X terminal manufacturing. The board, which comes with a MIPS-based
microprocessor manufactured by LSI, can be used in one of two ways: If you
want to develop your own X server software, you can use the Racer X as a
target system onto which you can download and debug software; if you want
to build a complete X terminal around the board, you can order it with AGE
Logic's Xoftware M300L X server.
   As well as two purposes, the Racer X board comes in two versions-one for
monochrome X terminal development and one for eight-bit color X terminal
development. The board includes four megabytes of dynamic RAM (DRAM)
expandable to eight megabytes, and the color version has one megabyte of
video RAM. The board is 7 by 9 1/4 inches, and supports 25-, 33-, and
40-MHz operations. It includes support for the requisite hardware features:
keyboard, mouse, and Ethernet ports. Price for the 25-MHz Racer X
evaluation board with eight-bit color is $3,950, or $2,950 for monochrome;
AGE's X server software is sold separately.

HOW ABOUT SOME COOPERATION HERE

The long-awaited version of NCR Corp.'s Cooperation for UNIX arrives this
summer to bring UNIX-based server software to Intel Corp. PCs-Cooperation
for OS/2 is already available. The underlying concept, pioneered by AT&T's
Rhapsody, is to have a multitasking operating system like UNIX on the
server and a single-tasking operating system like DOS on the desktop.
Cooperation is actually a collection of 50 modules in four categories that
work together to bring information from the network to the desktop. Using
Cooperation's modules, developers can set up users' desktops to take
advantage of the company's particular environment.
   The modules can be information access, user, application, and network
services. Information access services include terminal emulation, transfer
protocols, and multiple database access. The second category, user
services, encompasses the graphical desktop, including the clock,
electronic mail, file manager, waste basket, and printer icons. At this
level you can also link "objects" so that one file can be linked to
another; for example, a spreadsheet can be linked to a word processing
file, so that the document is automatically updated when the spreadsheet is
changed. Cooperation provides "application bridges" to more than 30 DOS and
Windows applications so you can import and export data.
   While the user services are linked on the desktop, the application
services help programmers link applications across the network. These
modules also handle security and logging information for the system
administrator. The fourth category, network services, handles the
connections between the NCR System 3000 servers and desktops using
Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager 2.0, as well as between the local-area
network (LAN) and IBM Corp. SNA-based systems. Network services also
include e-mail gateway facilities to a variety of proprietary systems via
Softswitch Inc.'s software gateways.
   Costs for 16-user systems range from $18,120 for Cooperation and $1,133
per user for a minimum configuration, to $44,710 for Cooperation and $2,794
per user. Prices depend on software options and do not include operating
system software for either the desktops or the servers.

BACKUP TO THE MAINFRAME

New Era's Harbor backup software is designed to let you use an MVS-based
IBM mainframe as an archive and server for networks that incorporates PCs
running DOS or OS/2 and UNIX workstations. The client computers can be
connected via 3270 emulation, TCP/IP, asynchronous protocols, or IBM's
advanced peer-to-peer communication protocol. Harbor lets you do overnight
backups, recovery, select which version of a document you want restored,
and check for non-standard files that may contain viruses.
   The software does incremental backups when activity is low, and offers
users the choice of which version to recover. The interface can be
character- or Microsoft Windows-based. The data is stored on the mainframe
in compressed mode, after which it can be migrated to less-expensive media.
Administrators can still use existing MVS data management and security
software features. Price ranges from $25,000 to $90,000 for the mainframe
component of the software, and from $90 to $260 per workstation, depending
on the number of workstations linked.

NOW PLAYING AT YOUR LOCAL XYPLEX

Xyplex Inc. has introduced two networking products, multiprotocol local
routers and an Ethernet-to-X.25 gateway. The 3210 and 3710 multiprotocol
local routers handle both internet protocol (IP) and IPX traffic, but other
protocols can be simultaneously bridged as well. The 3210 local router is a
standalone device with two Ethernet connections priced at $3,695. The 3710
is a board that you can install in a Xyplex communications chassis, and is
priced at $2,995.
   The 6025 Ethernet-to X.25 gateway provides TCP/IP and LAT users with
access to X.25 wide area networks, and lets users of public and private
packet-switched data networks connect to resources on the Ethernet LAN. The
6025 includes a 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive. Because the X.25 gateway
provides a local connection from a host with an X.25 interface to a
TCP/IP-LAT Ethernet LAN, it helps network managers can protect their
investment in older technology, according to Xyplex. The 6025 gateway is
priced at $4,995.

LEAVING PRINTS ON THE NETWORK

An alternative to buying a printer that links to an Ethernet network is to
buy an adapter that links your current printer to Ethernet. Microplex's
M201 TCP/IP printer adapter lets you link plotters, printers, or other
output devices to the network. You can attach one parallel and two serial
printers to the Microplex adapter, which incorporates a 16-bit
microprocessor and direct-memory access capability for better performance.
The parallel port transfers data at 50,000 characters per second, while the
serial ports operate at up to 38.4 kilobits per second and support Xon/Xoff
protocols. All three ports can output data simultaneously. One of the
serial interfaces also acts as a console port so you can run diagnostics.
   The adapter includes software to configure the adapter's IP address and
port parameters. Command-line utilities display printer status on any
connected terminal or workstation. An interface to System V and Berkeley
UNIX spooling permits multiple host access to printers and spooling. The
host software works with operating systems from AT&T, Digital Equipment
Corp., DataGeneral Corp., HP, IBM, SCO, and Sun. Price is $995.

MEET ME DOWN AT THE BAR CODE

Basis Inc. is working to simplify connecting UNIX systems to bar-code
scanning systems. Its BIS/System consists of a set of programming modules
that let users bypass special gateways that might have been necessary in
the past. According to Basis, you can transport scanned bar code
data-without intermediate devices-to networked databases where the
information can be manipulated, filed, and printed. The Basis software can
support up to 140 Intermec Corp. scanners or printing devices per host, and
can be used with SPARCstations, Tandem Corp. Integrity fault-tolerant
systems, and PCs running SCO UNIX.
   The modules can be used like building blocks. BIS/One is a C-based
application programming interface (API). BIS/Net is a networked version of
the BIS/One API. BIS/SNMP adds SNMP capability to manage the devices. The
fourth module, BIS/X, provides an X Windows interface for graphical
depiction of devices on the network. The software supports C-language SQL
bindings in Oracle Corp., Informix Software Inc., and Sybase Inc.
databases, among others. Initial license prices are based on largest class
of machine on the network. BIS/One prices range from $495 to $1,295 for the
initial license, and from $195 to $695 for each additional user. Prices for
BIS/Net range from $995 to $3,995, and from $295 to $995. Prices for
BIS/SNMP and BIS/X range from $250 to $995, and from $75 to 250.

JUST THE FAX

A new division of Samsung devoted to software has inaugurated its first
product, Replix, a UNIX fax application. It eliminates the need for a fax
machine, and uses your computer as a sending or receiving device. You can
fax documents directly from Postscript and ASCII documents, or e-mail.
According to Samsung, you can also send faxes to multiple recipients and
schedule faxes for later transmission. You can forward incoming faxes to
other users through e-mail or automatic printing.
   Replix lets you build "phone books" for personal or departmental use,
with easy selection of multiple recipients. The software also allows you to
query the system for the status of incoming and outgoing faxes. Running
under X Windows with the Motif interface, Replix can be integrated with
other X Windows-based applications. Replix runs on Sun, HP, IBM, PC, and
Samsung computers running UNIX, and can transmit faxes to ASCII terminals.
An Everex 24/96 D Class 2 fax modem is also required. Price starts at
$2,395 for two clients, unlimited servers, one modem, and unlimited
command-line clients. Additional support is available in separate
packages.

GETTING THE SALESQ MESSAGEQ

Following its BugQ and CustomerQ applications for handling software
problems and customer support, Quintus has developed two more workgroup
applications. SalesQ is for sales and contract tracking, while MessageQ
handles telephone messages. According to Quintus, SalesQ can automate sales
and lead tracking, direct mail campaigns, activity reporting and
forecasting, and customer contract management. You can get a system that is
already configured, or contract with Quintus for further customization. The
latter might include setting up rules specific to your business (for
example, no selling more product to a customer that hasn't paid invoices
consistently), setting up communication to customers via e-mail or fax, or
creating ad hoc report generation capabilities. Price ranges from $50,000
to $100,000, depending on customization and integration requirements.
   MessageQ handles telephone messages so that they can be sent by e-mail,
kept in a database, or faxed to off-site locations where employees might be
traveling. According to Quintus, it can be used as a primary or back-up
messaging system, or as a departmental system. Price ranges from $1,500 for
a basic system to $5,000.

HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST?

GE Aerospace has developed a version of its software price estimation
software, Price S, for PCs running UNIX. Originally available only on
mainframes, Price S is designed to give software developers realistic
schedule and cost estimates. It can also estimate the cost of developing,
integrating, and testing related software modules into a single system. To
calculate the projected cost of a software project, you only need seven
parameters, according to GE.
   These parameters could include be the size of the program (in bytes),
the number of lines of code, the percentage of new code to be written, or
the memory constraints of the hardware. The pricing software can also take
into account the percentage of the code that will be devoted to certain
tasks, such as real-time input or math calculations. Cost of Price S is
$17,000 per year for a single copy (site licenses are also available).

FILE THIS UNDER EZ

SJT Software has developed a file manager for PC UNIX systems using SCO and
Interactive UNIX SVR3. The EZ-File Manager is an interface designed to take
the place of the command line. You can launch an application simply by
putting the cursor next to it, and you can execute commands for particular
files by typing the command name next to the file name. The program keeps a
visual history of previously typed commands and directories, and lets you
copy, move, delete, chmod, and chown entire directory structures. For
programmers, it updates directories regularly, so that when the compile
process creates a new file, it appears on the EZ-File Manager interface.
Running on EGA/VGA screens, the software costs $198.

NOT MY FAULT TOLERANCE

1776 Inc. has developed fault-tolerant software for PC UNIX systems called
Multi-Host that lets one system act as a backup for the other. When a fault
is detected in the primary machine, the Multi-Host software automatically
switches activity over to the backup system. The two systems are linked
through an external SCSI bus.
   According to 1776, this "light fault tolerance" capability can bring
high-availability to lower-cost systems. A lower-cost option requires
switch-over to be handled by a human operator. Price of the Multi-Host
software ranges from $1,990 to $5,980, based on system and configuration.

UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM

Unbound has developed redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) storage
subsystems for Sun, DEC, and Macintosh users that can manage up to 70
gigabytes of data. The Raidstor systems can handle any of three RAID
levels: 0 (disk striping), 3 (parity using a spare drive), and 5 (the
ability to replace hard disks on the fly). The subsystems use SCSI-2
connections with up to 20 megabyte-per-second data transfer between the
host and up to 35 5 1/4-inch SCSI disk drives. Within the Raidstor system
is a 25-MHz Intel RISC processor that manage the disk arrays.
   The subsystems are available in both rack-mount and cabinet
configurations. Software diagnostics are built in and an LCD readout
indicates disk failure. Ranging in size for 7.5 to 70 gigabytes, the
Raidstor costs from $35,224 to $270,368.

SCANNING FOR SCANNERS
The scanner for your UNIX application isn't a commodity, yet-here's how
toavoid paying too much for the wrong one

By:
Mike Burgard


It's Dr. Eddie Prestridge's responsibility to make sure mass-produced items
like telephones and desks withstand the wear and tear they receive during
typical use. At Princeton Gamma-Tech Inc., an image enhancement firm,
Prestridge's clients use electron microscopes to analyze the materials in
these products. The problem is, some of their clients' older electron
microscopes can only generate hard-copy prints.
   Prestridge used video cameras to capture these prints for further
analysis, but they were slow and degraded image resolution. To solve the
problem, he purchased a scanner and attached it to a UNIX workstation.
Scanning the hard-copy prints lets Princeton Gamma-Tech input higher
resolution images and conduct better analysis using its own
image-enhancement equipment. Says Prestridge, "Video can only produce 512
pixels per line, while our scanner supports 4,000 pixels per line."
Princeton Gamma-Tech's specialized application is just one of many
applications of UNIX-based scanners. The complexity of the company's work
is indicative of what considerations go into the purchase of a scanner.
Unlike commodity items such as printers, scanners are generally purchased
for specific tasks.
   Scanner prices start at about $2,000 for a simple grayscale UNIX desktop
scanner-these resemble their PC-based siblings, and are about the same size
as a PC. Prices can climb to over $500,000 for a bundled high-end document
archive system. These larger free-standing machines look more like office
photocopiers, and usually have an integrated workstation and monitor for
editing and enhancing images.
   The key elements of scanners are speed, resolution, and compatibility.
Scanning technology has not advanced enough that a single system can meet
all these requirements, so compromise is inevitable. High-speed scanners
might scan as many as 25,000 documents in an eight-hour day.
High-resolution scanners can give you images as detailed as 2,400 dots per
inch (dpi), but at substantially lower speeds. In thecases in which users
insisted on the highest resolution at the highest speed, they paid dearly
for it.
   In most cases, once you've decided whether your application demands
speed or resolution, you must next consider software and compatibility. Do
you need a scanner with optical character recognition (OCR) software? Or do
you just need to access scanned images, such as invoices and other forms,
without modifying them?
   Whatever the task, no one wants to invest in an entirely new hardware
system to accommodate a scanner. Compatibility concerns include how the
scanner connects to your computer, what type of software is provided, and
how well it works with your existing system.
   All scanners, regardless of style or size, use a similar technology.
Think of a scanner as a high-powered copier with a direct interface to your
computer's hard disk. A beam of light passes over a document and captures
the image, the scanner then stores the image and tunes the results.
Grayscale scanners store each pixel as various shades of dark and light
bits. Color scanners separate the three primary colors into various shades
of each color. Resolution is affected by many factors, but is primarily
tied to the speed at which the light passes over the document. More bits
captured by the light mean a better quality image, but often at a slower
speed.
   Users of UNIX-based scanners usually fall into one of three application
groups. First, there are the traditional prepress and graphic arts
professionals who use systems designed to combine typeset text and scanned
images on a single page of a magazine, catalog, or brochure.
   The second group is users of large document archival systems, in which
thousands of documents, varying in size, content, and quality, may be
archived in a single day. At the U.S. Library of Congress, for example,
government workers input 2,500 to 5,000 documents a day. Scanners that
allow such high-volume input usually only support 60 to 200 dpi
resolution.
   Finally, people like Prestridge, and other scientists and engineers, are
in the group most likely to use desktop scanners for image-enhancement
applications. These people scan maps, drawings, and photographs and enhance
the images pixel by pixel to meet a specific need.

Can It do the Job?
Resolution and speed sit opposite each other on a seesaw: when one goes up,
the other comes down. Ed Ball is in charge of the prepress operations at
commercial printer Pearl Pressman Inc. He needs the quality of his scans to
match the quality of the finished printed pieces as closely as possible.
Commercial printing presses print at higher resolutions than computer
printers do, so if you input a photo with a low-resolution scanner, the
press cannot raise the resolution of the photograph. As a result, if the
scanner can't produce at least 1,000-dpi scans, the quality of what comes
out of the press suffers. Ball already owned a UNIX page layout system
capable of 2,400-dpi output, so he chose Du Pont Inc.'s expensive Imagitex
scanner to get the fastest speed possible with high resolution. But he paid
a price in excess of six figures to balance the seesaw as best he could.
   Dave Godman of General Dynamics Corp.'s electronics division, chose the
more typical path-high resolution at slower speed. Godman's group enhances
images for the U.S. Department of Defense, scanning maps provided by
military organizations including the Defense Mapping Agency. Using the maps
as background, Godman superimposes test-flight routes. The map is then
given to pilots for use on test flights.
   In order to create much more detailed maps, Godman needed a
high-resolution scanner that connected to his Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. Sharp Corp.'s JX-600 gave him 600-dpi resolution at a
relatively low cost, but he had to compromise on speed, and gets only about
10 scans a day.
   Another user responsible for a state government contract needed exactly
the opposite trade-off between speed and resolution. Ken Sjogren, director
of Image System Products for Grumman Information Conversion, was bidding on
a contract that involved archiving years of paper-based tax records.
Sjogren used Eastman Kodak Co.'s 900 scanner-which is designed to work with
document-archival systems and scan up to 25,000 pages a day-in a
pre-contract demonstration. Sjogren believes the machine's speed swung the
state's decision in Grumman's favor.
   An issue is how to get documents into an archival system. According to
users, an automatic paper feeder is the best solution, but you may need to
look for one that can handle odd-size sheets. Users report that automatic
feeders work fine with 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper, but can jam up with odd-size
documents.

Working Together
Scanners are not like a typical peripheral that you can just plug in and
have work with your system. Compatibility, particularly in the area of
hardware connections and system integration, drives many a decision.
   As a photo retoucher for McMaster Carr Supply Inc., Johanna Stevens
could justify purchasing a scanner only if it worked with the Xyvision Inc.
page layout system she was using. She works with the pictures that go into
the catalog of parts and supplies McMaster sends to customers across the
country. There are thousands of pictures in every catalog, and because
every new or altered product has to have a new image placed in the computer
system, Stevens frequently stores more than 30,000 images.
   Before she bought a scanner, Stevens would get a photograph, send it to
a service bureau that stored it on a computer disk, wait up to three days
for its return, and then finally work on touching up the photo. Buying one
of Du Pont's scanners allows her to do all scanning in-house. It now takes
only an hour to restore an image, instead of days. Even this significant
time savings would have been offset by hardware costs had the scanner been
incompatible with the Xyvision system, however.
   The physical interface can be a compatibility sticking point for some.
Princeton Gamma-Tech's Prestridge found that most scanners don't use a SCSI
interface. A SCSI connection was a critical factor because Princeton
Gamma-Tech resells image-enhancement hardware with SCSI as the primary
interface, and the company could not risk compatibility problems.
   To avoid this, look closely at the interface you use and your scanner
will need. Some scanners, such as Du Pont's, attach directly to your
Ethernet network. And still others use the IEEE-sanctioned general-purpose
interface bus; several board vendors offer IEEE-488 expansion boards for
both VMEbus- and SBus-based workstations. Both Sharp and Mitsubishi Corp.
scanners use this interface, but have recently added SCSI support as well.

Integrating Your Software
The software interface is as important as the hardware interface. Most
people don't want to write both software interfaces for users and device
drivers for scanners. Users were happier working on the latter than the
former. In-house programming shops and system integrators tend to customize
their own interface, regardless of what is provided by the vendor.
   However, if your application involves document archival, software
compatibility tends to be of lesser importance because you're more likely
to need an integrated system that already has built-in scanners,
workstations, storage capability, and software.
   On the other hand, if you intend to scan and manipulate text, you need
to research whether the scanner you want features OCR software. Some
high-resolution systems incorporate OCR capabilities directly. Other
vendors sell an optional OCR software package, while still others leave it
up to third-party vendors. UNIX machines tend to be used more for
pixel-by-pixel image enhancement rather than text in OCR applications.
Remember that document archival often involves scanning paper with various
typefaces, intermixed images, and handwriting samples of questionable
quality. According to users, these challenges are beyond even the best OCR
software.
   Finally, regarding software, a typical eight-inch-square, eight-bit
color image scanned at 600 dpi takes about 23 megabytes of disk space,
which brings up data compression issues when you need high resolution for a
lot of images. One user strongly suggests that buyers ask vendors about
image-compression software to reduce storage requirements. Barring
compression built into the scanner, you can also look for boards for your
workstations that support data compression.

Price Scanners
Because they're not a commodity, scanners are not nearly as homogeneous as
other hardware peripherals when it comes to price. You can pay anywhere
from $2,000 to more than $150,000 for an integrated high-resolution scanner
and edit station, and up to $500,000 for document archive systems-so price
becomes an issue, especially for system integrators. For example, Princeton
Gamma-Tech bought its scanner from Apunix Inc., partially because the price
fit in with what it wanted to be able to charge for its own
image-enhancement equipment. On the other hand, Pearl Pressman's Ed Ball
wanted quality output and compatibility, so there was less flexibility on
what he had to pay.
   Scanner purchases only vaguely resemble hard drive or network card
purchases. Different uses, and a technical stalemate between speed and
resolution, require that you think long and hard about the scanner's
intended use. Words of wisdom from users sadly advise that, unlike most
computer purchases, price should be one of the last considerations. Step
one is to look at your application and decide whether your primary
objective is speed or resolution. Step two is to research the interfaces in
both hardware and software.
   The day may come, as more peripheral functions are integrated into
workstations, that step three may not be price consideration. Until then,
if you application requires a certain kind of scanning, the price is not
yet negotiable.

RIVALS COMPETE FOR E-MAIL STANDARDS

Electronic mail is rapidly becoming a communications mainstay for many
businesses. While it was once used only within individual organizations,
e-mail is now used to communicate between organizations. And this includes
more than just polite notes from one friend to another-today, e-mail
versions of purchase orders, invoices, financial transfers, and other
business documents are replacing their paper equivalents.
   But e-mail faces a major problem: incompatible e-mail formats make it
hard to send messages across different networks. Two standards are
currently competing to resolve that difficulty. One is the simple mail
transport protocol (SMTP) style of mail currently used on most UNIX
networks in the United States. The other is the international-standard
X.400 mail, the preferred type of e-mail in Europe which is also used by
most U.S. commercial e-mail carriers, such as MCI Mail. If one of the two
can gain clear dominance, it will define the shape of e-mail to come.

E-mail Evolution
E-mail found its earliest business uses when large time-sharing mainframes
made it possible to put a terminal on each employee's desk. Replacing paper
notes or memos between employees with electronic versions was a logical
application of computerized office-automation systems, such as IBM Corp.'s
PROFS e-mail. Early e-mail systems had a significant drawback, however: a
paper memo could go to anyone, but e-mail could only be sent to employees
connected to the same computer. With the arrival of UNIX workstations, and
PCs using local-area network systems such as Novell Inc.'s Netware, e-mail
became even more familiar to many large organizations-although it remained
limited to users directly connected to the local network in many cases.
   Today, e-mail is frequently sent between organizations. UNIX e-mail was
an early success, largely thanks to the support provided by the Internet, a
research network that was funded by the U.S. Defense Department to link
universities and other defense contractors. But commercial e-mail providers
such as MCI and AT&T have also demonstrated that there's a demand among
other businesses for the ability to send messages from one organization to
another-so much demand that they can make a profit from it.
   Other, more specialized forms of e-mail have also found wide business
acceptance. The most well-known is probably electronic data interchange
(EDI), a special form of e-mail that consists of electronic versions of
purchase orders, financial transfers, and other business documents. An EDI
message is not simply the text of a purchase order in electronic form;
instead, it's actually a data file that contains information in such a
well-defined format that it can be generated by one company's computer,
sent electronically to another company, and processed by the recipient's
computers-completely without human intervention. That's far faster, more
efficient, and error-free than paper documents that must be printed out
from one company's computers, delivered, then typed back into another
company's machines.
   Still other kinds of existing e-mail-such as the voice e-mail available
on computers from Next Computer Inc.-point to a future in which e-mail
could carry voice, images, and other binary data between different
companies and different machines as easily as it carries text messages
today.

The Compatibility Question
For the most part, e-mail's widespread success has been limited to text
with messages that will be read by human beings. Human readers are
remarkably flexible when it comes to finding messages in text, no matter
how it's formatted or what extraneous information the e-mail may contain.
Human readers have relatively little difficulty deciding which part of an
e-mail message is the "real message," and which part is information on how
the message traveled from the sender to the receiver-the electronic
equivalent of a postmark.
   That kind of flexibility isn't available when a computer is supposed to
read and process non-text messages. Computers need a well-defined format to
identify where a digitized voice message begins and ends, or where the data
in an EDI message is to be found. Without such standard formats, it's
impossible to send that kind of e-mail. As a result, it's not surprising
that EDI messages are usually sent through networks that cater exclusively
to EDI users, or that Next's voice e-mail can only be used by Next
computers.
   On the other hand, when it comes to addressing a message, e-mail has no
lack of standards. If anything, there are far too many addressing
standards. For a letter sent via the postal service, there's a unique,
relatively simple address for every possible destination. But, when the
message is e-mail, the address can be highly complex, and messages going to
the same destination can have addresses that vary widely depending on the
sender. In some cases, messages with the same sender and receiver can be
properly addressed in different ways. How can the sender be sure the
address is correct?
   In simple terms, the problem is compatibility-the lack of a
well-accepted, dominant standard for e-mail addressing and formatting.
Fortunately, proponents of each of the two most widely used flavors of
e-mail-SMTP and X.400-are working to solve that problem by creating address
and format standards. Unfortunately, they're not necessarily working to
provide compatibility between the two camps.

SMTP
SMTP is the e-mail protocol used by most UNIX users in the United States.
The reason is simple: the "backbone" for sending messages is the
government-funded collection of networks called the Internet. It was
Internet users who developed SMTP to route e-mail between Internet sites.
Strictly speaking, the Internet is only for use by U.S. defense
contractors, but many Internet sites are also connected to other networks,
including commercial networks such as UUNET. As a result, a large number of
U.S. UNIX users can send e-mail to one another, as well as to many other
sites throughout the world.
   Although SMTP's "first name" is Simple, using it can be more complicated
than anyone would like it to be. A major problem stems from the fact that
SMTP has two widely used systems of addressing. In the first, it's up to
the sender to specify the path the message will travel to its destination.
That usually requires knowing the name of a major site connected to a
backbone network, and then specifying the names of other specific network
nodes on the way to the user, all separated by exclamation points (!). For
example, uunet!uworld!frankh begins with a backbone site (uunet), followed
by a node connected to it (uworld), followed by the user's name (frankh).
Depending on which backbone sites the addressee is connected to, many
different valid addresses may be used for the same destination.
   The solution to that confusion is the other major form of SMTP
addressing, the domain name system (DNS). In DNS, the e-mail system itself
maintains a directory of unique node names, so the sender need only specify
the "home machine" and user: frankh@uworld.com. DNS is steadily being
adopted for SMTP mail, but the older addressing style is still common. To
make matters worse, some senders choose addresses that mix the two styles,
such as uunet!frankh@uworld.com-a confusing, non-standard address that
results in the e-mail being delivered successfully on some networks and
returned as undeliverable on others.
   And although SMTP is older and better-established than other kinds of
e-mail, its age creates another problem: All contents of an SMTP mail
message, including the address, must be in a form that requires only seven
bits per byte, such as ASCII text. Non-text messages like voice, EDI, and
binary computer code require eight bits per byte, so such binary messages
must first be somehow encoded into seven-bit text.

X.400
X.400 e-mail is based on an international standard designed to solve many
of the problems associated with SMTP mail. The X.400 standard was developed
by a working group of CCITT, the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee. The original standard was released in 1984, and in
1988 was expanded to include formats for non-text binary messages.
   In X.400, every destination has only one address that consists of a
series of ever-more-specific locations, beginning with the addressee's
country and working down to the user's account name. As with SMTP's DNS,
the address is unique, but in X.400 it's stored in binary form in the
e-mail's header section. This means the header must be created by a special
program called a "user agent," which encodes the address and packages the
message contents for mailing. As a result, the user-agent software can
request the address from the sender in any appropriate form, and the
address details can be hidden from the sender if desired. In addition,
because the body of an X.400 message can be binary, it's much easier to
send non-text messages that must be re-encoded for SMTP mail-at least in
theory.
   In practice, although X.400 may be technically superior to SMTP mail, it
lacks the infrastructure and support services that SMTP users enjoy from
the Internet-such as directory systems, help for addressing problems, and
widely available software for packaging mail into the proper X.400 form.
That's a major reason X.400 is more popular in Europe than in the United
States. Because there's no Internet to provide a strong, reliable
infrastructure for SMTP in Europe, users must create their own support
services which makes SMTP less attractive outside the United States.
   Another drawback is that many existing X.400 mail systems use the older,
1984 version of the standard, which limits its advantages. For example, the
U.S. version of X.400 is largely used by commercial e-mail carriers such as
MCI and AT&T. They use X.400-1984, which doesn't specify exact formats for
different kinds of binary mail, and as a result, each carrier must specify
its own binary mail formats, and messages sent from one carrier to another
are limited to ordinary text.

Competition and Cooperation
Work is not at a standstill on either SMTP or X.400. SMTP's advantage is
the excellent infrastructure support its users get from the Internet. To
encourage use and support of X.400 on the Internet, a project at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison is working to build some of the basic
support systems necessary to make X.400 easily usable on the
Internet-including user-agent software and directory services. The X.400
Internet project is also specifying the implementation details for many
kinds of X.400 binary mail, so that Internet and commercial X.400 users
will be able to send and receive non-text e-mail-regardless of where it
originates or how many networks it must cross.
   But X.400's lead in non-text messages won't last. An Internet technical
group is working on a specification, called Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extension (MIME), that will allow SMTP mail to contain non-text messages.
   Will competition between partisans of the two e-mail styles torpedo
compatibility between them? Probably not. Most users don't care whether
their messages use SMTP or X.400-what's important to them is that the mail
must go through. Currently, that means messages sent between networks may
require a lowest-common-denominator approach-text only. In the future,
appropriate gateways should make it possible to send non-text messages
between SMTP and X.400, by translating from the binary-format
specifications being developed by the Internet X.400 project and the SMTP
MIME extensions.
   Realistically, X.400 is the e-mail wave of the future. But thanks to the
strength of SMTP, that wave may crest for most of the world long before
X.400 becomes dominant in the United States. Still, if the Internet
projects to fill in the gaps in each style of e-mail are successful, they
may eventually converge. When that happens, SMTP and X.400-and especially
their users-will be the winners.

METATOOL TO THE RESCURE

By:
Omri Serlin


Sience the early days of computing, a problem that has loomed larger than
others has been how to bridge arcane sequences of logic signals-which are
the only language a computer really understands-to forms of expression
humans can read, write, and comprehend.
   The quest to accomplish this has led to two separate but complementary
solutions. One is the development of operating systems, linking loaders,
I/O drivers, and standard utilities. In addition to allowing users to
manipulate system components using relatively simple abstractions, these
tools help manage the resources of computer systems. Recent examples
include the type of system software that automatically manages file
migration between multiple levels of system storage, such as main memory,
extended memory, disk drives, and robot-arm tape drives.
   From the users' point of view, a more interesting development has been
that of automatic programming systems. Even a simple assembler, which is
today considered not much different than "machine language," introduces a
programming interface that humans find significantly easier to manipulate.
For instance, when was the last time you tried to create a program using
hexadecimal or octal notation?
   Compilers, such as Fortran and Cobol, created an even higher level of
abstraction, and allowed humans to write programs in languages that were
much closer to the intended application. To a mathematician, the statement
X = SQRT(A**2 + B**2) makes a lot more sense than the equivalent sequence
of a dozen or so obscure machine-language instructions. Similarly, Cobol
provides facilities to define and manipulate files and records in terms
readily understood by commercial application developers.

SDTs: The Next Step
The next step along this path has been referred to as fourth-generation
languages (4GLs), applications generators, or non-procedural languages.
These tools allow programmers to define an application in terms that are
even closer to the application's own semantics. Unlike the strictly
sequential nature of procedural languages like Fortran, Cobol, C, and
Pascal, these more modern tools allow applications to be defined as block
diagrams-that is, a collection of processing tasks and the
interrelationships between them.
   These tools are increasingly being referred to as specification-driven
tools or SDTs. They have become the heart of many of the computer-aided
software engineering (CASE) systems currently offered by a host of
vendors-the IEF, for information engineering facility, product family from
Texas Instruments Inc., for example.
   A SDT reads a specification-a description of an application in a
language that is tailored to that application-and generates a "product" in
response. The product is often a description or source code of the same
application in a more conventional programming language, such as C, that
can be compiled and executed.
   Until now, the creation of an SDT was a difficult process, but a number
of vendors are currently proposing to ease the task of creating SDTs by
providing an SDT builder (SDTB). An SDTB is in itself an SDT. Because its
output is another SDT, rather than an application, an SDTB can be
considered a meta-SDT. One example, Metatool, is being marketed by AT&T
Bell Laboratories.
   Rather than read an application specification, as a conventional SDT
would do, Metatool reads two kinds of specification files: one describing
the source language to be used to define the application; the other
describing the desired product that the resulting SDT is expected to
produce. The output of the SDTB is the source code for the desired
application-specific SDT. Once compiled, and augmented with macros and
library routines, this SDT will be capable of reading the application
specification and producing the desired product.
   More than one product can be specified by using a separate
specification, or product description file, for each.
   AT&T's Metatool has been used under its original name, Stage, in more
than 100 internal software development projects with observed programmer
productivity improvements from 4:1 to 40:1. In addition, the use of the
SDTB resulted in improved software quality and delivery schedules,
according to AT&T.

Measuring Productivity
As with all CASE tools, productivity, quality, and timeliness claims are
rough estimates at best. Quantitative comparisons require setting up and
measuring two independent development projects, with one using the tools
and the other using conventional programming techniques.
   Nevertheless, at least one reasonable quantitative measure is available,
and with it AT&T has been able to support its productivity claims. The
reasoning goes something as follows: If an application program contains
2,000 lines of code (LOCs), using an SDT tool, perhaps 250 lines of
specifications are needed to produce the 2,000 LOCs-an 8:1 improvement. Of
course, creating the SDT tool by hand could require writing 8,000 LOCs.
This still may be quite acceptable if the investment in the SDT is
amortized over numerous applications.
   However, using Metatool, perhaps only 500 lines of code are required to
populate the source and product description files. In this case, a 2.7:1
productivity advantage is achieved. The productivity gain is increased if
the SDT can be reused many times.
   Metatool, and other products of the same ilk, are likely to excel in
short-term applications for which the target SDT is used for relatively
simple processing tasks. In principle, an SDTB could be used to create,
say, a complete language compiler. In fact, Metatool and the target SDT
created by it use tools including lex and yacc to perform their tasks.
These old UNIX standbys provide the lexical analysis and parsing functions,
respectively; which are crucial elements of any translator, compiler, or
SDT. But creating the description files for a full-featured, complex
language requires above-average programming skills, which, in effect,
defeats the purpose of an SDTB.
   Another reason that short-term, simple usage is the preferred
environment for applying Metatool is that the efficiency of the generated
code produced by the target SDT isn't as good as what might be obtained by
direct-coding of the application. This discrepancy is a common
characteristic of application generators and SDTs. In addition, the
specific way in which Metatool creates the parse tree-a formal, internal
representation of the input language-contributes to this shortcoming. The
gains in productivity are usually more than enough to justify the
inefficiency of the generated code, however. Another problem is that yacc
error messages are not as precise as one would wish in identifying the
offending code.
   Metatool is an interesting approach to simplifying the construction of
complex UNIX applications. In principle, Metatool can even be used to
create SDTs for environments other than UNIX, and has been used in a number
of projects for various hardware platforms. Within its limitations,
Metatool should prove useful to application and system builders.

Aftermath Of A Battle -- AT&T And NCR Present United Front To Reassure
Users

By  DAN RICHMAN



    New York-As the $7.48 billion takeover battle for NCR wound to a close
last week, executives of both AT&T and its soon-to-be newest subsidiary
joined arms in a new campaign: one aimed at keeping their two sets of
users happy.

    Armed with top-level promises of continued migration and product
support for all existing offerings, officials on both sides worked double
time to be as reassuring as possible.

    NCR President Gilbert P. Williamson, who has been tapped to replace
retiring Chairman Charles Exley as the NCR unit's CEO once the takeover is
complete, went out of his way to comfort AT&T buyers.

    ``We would like to assure AT&T customers that they will be fully
protected, with a full migration path to the next generation of
products,'' he said. ``We agree [with AT&T] that there will be no change
in our product direction and in the basic principles that underlie that
direction.''

    Over the next five months, AT&T and NCR officials said, a transition
planning team consisting of six to eight employees from each company will
be working constantly to try and work out all the details of the product
line merger. The planning team-to be co-chaired by Exley and AT&T Computer
Systems President Richard McGinn-will be isolated from day-to-day
operations so that their discussions do not distract routine operations.

    Most NCR and AT&T users contacted last week, however, seemed unsure
how they would act if they suddenly had to make a major Unix purchase
during the next several months, as the two companies are hammering out
their differences.

    Paul S. Sawyer, a computer specialist with the University of New
Hampshire's telecommunications department, is still using a 3B15 that he
bought in 1985 to link a network of 12 terminals and 13 MACs. Even though
his 3B15 is ``obsolete'' and he has the authorization to replace the
machine, Sawyer said he is putting off any new purchases until the merger
has concluded and ``things have settled down a little. The situation is
just too uncertain right now.''

    ``Definitely we will wait and see what happens,'' he said, referring
to the talks of product mergers. ``I want to know what they are up to
first.''

    Gordon Curr, vice president of MIS for Hyatt Hotels, was less affected
by the news. He said any concern he might have had with the effects of the
merger were offset by Hyatt's recent purchase of AT&T's RISC-based System
7000 running SVR3.0.

    ``The purchase of a Unix-based system was meant to protect me from
changes by any manufacturer,'' Curr said. ``They can introduce a whole new
product line, but as long as it's Unix, it's fine with me.''

    Michael Nolan, a Lincoln, Neb., consultant who uses NCR's I series and
a Tower and last year chaired the NCR Unix Users' Group, said he thinks
the merger will probably help NCR really develop the 3000 Series. He said
many had wondered whether NCR had sufficient resources to accomplish those
development efforts alone.

    ``Now there's no question,'' he said. ``They've sure got the cash.''

    Jim Mercer, an educational systems manager for the Law Society of
Upper Canada, said his main concern is AT&T's products.

    ``We use three 3B2s, and rumor has it that if the merger goes through,
the line goes away,'' Mercer said. ``It's so incredibly expensive to buy
parts for that it's pretty much gone away already, but if we are still
using it, it would be nice to have support. The merger really opens up the
question of whether we'll have it.''

    AT&T has promised that the 3B2s will be provided for, despite threats
some months back from Exley that NCR would close down the line were the
takeover successful. ``Those with 3B2s can rest assured that their
investment is safe,'' AT&T spokesman John Skalko said. He added that while
he won't promise that the 3B2 will not be dropped, there exists an $850
million contract with the U.S. Air Force calling for delivery of about
20,000 units from 1989 through 1994.

    ``I don't know what products will stay and which will go,'' he said.
``But we won't strand customers under any circumstances. We'll have
complete backward and forward compatibility to protect their investment.''

    Skalko also said that a 3B2 microprocessor upgrade would be announced
later this month. He declined to give details, but James Clark, vice
president of high-performance and fault-tolerant systems, early last month
referred to the 3B2s using a RISC processor and running SVR4.

    AT&T Chairman Robert Allen pledged that the months of merger planning
will not affect current computer efforts for either firm. ``The companies
will meet their revenue figures,'' he said. ``There are plenty of
competitors out there [who] are bound to be disappointed.''

    While future lines are debated privately, officials with both firms
hope users continue to make purchases even though the future is uncertain.

    ``We're not going to do anything to reduce the value of any product,
whether NCR's or AT&T's, so there's no reason at all for people to hold
off their purchases,'' said R. Elton White, currently NCR's executive vice
president of marketing and the man slated to become the president and
chief operting officer of NCR when the merger is finalized.

    White said NCR achieved record revenues during this year's first
quarter, despite widespread speculation the acquisition would occur. ``Now
that it's actually occurred, why should sales drop?'' he asked.

    Similarly, AT&T has said that its computer systems division had turned
in record orders during March and April.

    When AT&T began the takeover effort with a $90-a-share offer in
November, both companies were engaged in major strategic changes. AT&T,
which has lost an estimated $2 billion in computers and is still not
reported as profitable in the computer arena, has been making its Unix
software entity more and more independent from its hardware side with
outside minority ownership announced this year.

    NCR last year announced that it is phasing out its proprietary
machines by next year to offer up an entirely open systems line of
products. NCR executives said throughout the takeover battle that it
wanted to be left alone to try to make its new all-open systems strategy
work.

    Throughout the six-month battle to keep NCR from being taken over,
Exley personally and aggressively attacked AT&T's computer operations,
saying he did not want to ``sacrifice'' NCR to ``bail out AT&T's failed
strategy'' and that the takeover was merely a ``desperate attempt to
salvage AT&T's disastrous foray into the computer business.''

    Exley had also pledged to never oversee such a combined entity and,
indeed, announced he'd retire several months early to avoid being at the
helm.

    At a news conference last week announcing the $110-a-share deal, Exley
smiled, said nice things about AT&T and avoided several questions about
his previous statements.

    ``It's amazing how some of those [comments] have faded from my
memory,'' Exley told reporters. AT&T's Allen shot back, ``It hasn't faded
from my memory.''

    While the deal was announced as an all-stock swap, the agreement sets
a variety of upper and lower limits that are tied into stock market
fluctuations. A government requirement or unfavorable stock market
activity could change the deal to one involving stock and cash.

NCR To Roll Out Commercial OLTP Parallel Machine

By  PAUL KRILL



    New York-NCR plans to launch here today a full-scale assault on the
mainframe market, with the introduction of a Unix-based commercial OLTP
computer that can reach performance of 2,000 MIPS and hold as many as 288
i486 processors.

    Called the NCR 3600, the parallel multiprocessor system has base
prices ranging from $855,000 for a basic unit with 30 to 35 processors, to
$8 million for a 288-processor system. NCR said the system has a
cost-per-MIPS rate of less than $5,000, vastly below that of conventional
mainframes. Processors are used for both applications processing and other
functions such as parallel database management.

    The multiple-cabinet-based unit can hold as much as 300 gigabytes of
disk storage, has a total system bandwidth of more than 12 gigabytes per
second, I/O bandwidth of 3.8 gigabytes per second and more than 380 SCSI
I/O channels, NCR said. NCR plans to make the unit available in September.

    The 3600 reportedly processes as many as 256 transactions per second,
a figure recorded in December 1990. ``I'm surprised that TPS isn't
higher,'' given the size and speed of the system, said Robert Kidd, an
analyst with San Jose-based Dataquest.

    George Lindamood, an analyst with the Gartner Group in Stamford,
Conn., however, called the 3600 a significant development.

    ``There have been other parallel processing machines, but this is the
first one intended for commercial, mission-critical applications, and not
just for use by tinkerers in a scientific environment,'' he said. ``This
is the most significant move into the mainstream by parallelism.''

    NCR is planning a follow-on release of the 3600 in 1992 that would
exceed speed of 10,000 MIPS, offer 1,000 gigabytes of storage and process
more than 1,200 transactions per second.

    The system, part of the NCR System 3000 family, incorporates Unix
System V.4, high-speed intelligent interconnect technology and a scalable
architecture, NCR said. The company is claiming that users can expect 99.9
percent availability and scalable relational database capabilities to
monitor and analyze operations.

    NCR is using a technology called message-passing parallelism, which
manages the computer's internal network by communicating interrelated
messages dealing with requests, status of work in process and results.
Tasks are handled by a high-speed intelligent interconnect technology
called Ynet, licensed from Teradata.

    Each processor runs its own copy of the operating system. This enables
the processors to perform other functions while waiting for messages or
replies from the network, NCR said.

    The unit features application processors (APs), which group several
486 processors together for application processing, and access module
processors (AMPs). The AMPs are also 486 processors that are used to
handle parallel database functions and support recovery facilities of the
3600 parallel database.

    NCR has established relationships with Sybase and Teradata in
developing the 3600.

    Omri Serlin, editor and publisher of the FT Systems newsletter
(fault-tolerant), said the 3600 presented ``a very interesting
architectural concept.'' But NCR failed to provide many benchmarks, he
added.

    ``When I start to see some performance benchmarks that are
outstanding, then I will become a true believer,'' Serlin said.

    He questioned, however, whether the system actually achieves 2,000
MIPS. ``They're simply counting every processor that can be put in and
attaching the peak theoretical performance,'' Serlin said.

    ``The big issue is, `Can you put all these processors to effective
use?' '' he said.

    Kidd said the 3600 ``kind of walks rings around everything in the
market'' insofar as raw performance is concerned. ``This is complex, very
inventive technology. The user could be confused by it,'' he said.

    Gene Manno, president and CEO of rival Arix, said the machine would
hurt sales of rival 486 users Sequent Computer Systems and Unisys. ``This
machine's going to eat Sequent's lunch,'' he said.

    But Sequent spokesman Grant Kimball said he did not see Sequent
competing against the NCR machine. ``It looks like a very large machine,
and there are other massively parallel machines out there that Sequent
never sees'' when competing for sales, he said.

    Arix's Manno said that NCR is apparently planning to position the
machine as a database platform. While the new NCR system might do well
there, Manno contended that many applications might not see that much
improved performance, simply because the workload on many applications
can't be shared using the configuration NCR appears to be using.

    ``If you have Lotus on a number of PCs, it probably won't run that
much faster than it does on a single processor,'' he said.

    Arix makes the Arix System 90, a parallel multiprocessing
supercomputer running Unix, which can be configured using up to 86
processors.

    Manno said that it appeared that the NCR system devoted a huge portion
of its processing power to keeping one copy of the operating system
running on each processor.

    ``This thing will look like 288 PCs on a LAN,'' Manno said. ``If you
took 288 486 PCs, it would run just as fast. It just looks like a tightly
coupled LAN, but all the processors are in one big box.''

    He added a contention that the use of Microchannel buses might create
a data bottleneck.

Supernet Test Set

By  LEE BRUNO



    Los Alamos, N.M.-In an experiment aimed at allowing people to share
and access high-end graphic visualization and animation files at speeds as
much as 160 times faster than Ethernet networks, four supercomputing
centers in the U.S. will be linked to one another this summer over a
high-speed fiber-optic network.

    But users and vendors agree that this summer's linkup will be only the
first step on a road that will likely lead to a quantum leap in speed for
network users, offering a glimpse of systems that in just a few years will
be high-speed information pipelines linking supercomputers to desktop
worksta

    tions. Once in place, users could see and interpret massive data files
in real time.

    This summer's test, called the Casa subgroup, is one of five tests
aimed at using gigabit networks funded by the Corporation for National
Research Initiative-a national effort aimed at exploring the possibilities
of upgrading the Internet to gigabit networks within the next 10 years.

    Experiment participants say the combined effort marks a milestone in
the future of high-speed networks and lays the foundation for the
technology that some estimate will be in the hands of commercial users
three to five years from now.

    Participants were the San Diego Supercomputing Center, NASA's Jet
Propulsion Labs, Los Alamos National Labs and the California Institute of
Technology.

    Essentially, the technology, called the High Performance Peripheral
Interface (HIPPI), is expected to help unclog the network bottleneck and
provide a pathway for supercomputers to pass data to workstations in real
time so that users can interact with massive data sets.

    Graphics users today often find it difficult visualizing large amounts
of data, such as reviewing seismic studies for oil exploration. Currently,
users are unable to effectively interact and model such data, which can be
as large as 30 gigabytes. The goal is to be able to link a supercomputer
such as a Cray over a high-speed network to a workstation, and then render
the data in 3-D while the supercomputer continues doing the intensive
computational tasks it is built for.

    For example, the ability to apply complex algorithms in shorter
periods of time to seismic data collected from a potential oil field would
give an oil company a strong competitive advantage over its competitors,
said Jeff O'Neil, director of reservoir computing at ARCO Oil and Gas in
Plano, Texas.

    ``It takes time to apply those algorithms, and the faster you can
apply those algorithms, the better results you can come up with,'' O'Neil
said. ``It means coming up with the better answer and being able to see
something that no one else has seen.''

    Today, that processing can take as long as six months to a year,
O'Neil said, but the greater bandwidth that HIPPI technology offers could
bring that down to a few months. For most similarly complex projects,
O'Neil estimates, the HIPPI effort should reduce processing time as much
as 75 percent.

    ``It is imperative that we make some dramatic improvements in the next
few years'' in the area of high-speed networks moving large amounts of
data, said Bob Judd, group leader of the computer graphics group C6 at Los
Alamos National Laboratories, one of the experiment participants.
``Ethernet just seems barely able to handle network video bandwidth.''

    One of the objectives of the HIPPI effort involves scientists who need
to share large graphic images over networks, something that today's
1-to-2-Mbyte-per-second Ethernet traffic makes all but impossible and, at
best, impractical.

    The HIPPI technology potentially can handle the large stream of data
used in animation and high-end visualization types of applications, Judd
said. For example, a single 24-bit color frame for a
1,000-by-1,000-resolution graphic image can use as much as 3 Mbytes of
memory. If a user wanted to run those images at 30 frames per second, the
throughput required for the network would be somewhere around 90 Mbytes
per second.

    Greg Chesson, chief scientist of research and development at Silicon
Graphics, projects that in three to five years, the HIPPI technology will
exist for networks that he expects to carry more than 100 Mbytes of data
per second.

    But he added that he found it ``hard to believe that these [future]
networks will be based solely on HIPPI technology.''

    At the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, they are using a
HIPPI interface to connect a Thinking Machines supercomputer to an
Ultranet 1-gigabyte network.

    ``We're expecting that a lot of the high-end workstations will begin
having the HIPPI interface,'' said Jim McCabe, project leader for the
network development group for the Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation program
at the Computer Science Corp. for NASA Ames.

    In a couple of years, McCabe said, he expects to connect to Ultranet
and get a 400-Mbyte-per-second data transfer rate.

    Today's leading workstation vendor, Sun Microsystems, agrees that
HIPPI is the current obvious choice for linking supercomputers to
workstations.

    But Sun, which is currently considering building an Sbus HIPPI
interface, has some concerns about how well HIPPI would do for its
customers in today's networks. ``The ability to construct a host interface
is only half of the solution,'' said Geoffrey Baehr, Sun's director of
networking and communication. ``One needs a low-cost high performance
switch.''

    Baehr said there is a great degree of difficulty building a HIPPI
switch and making it affordable to the $5,000 workstation user.

    As computational power increases, people are willing to develop
applications that allow the data to flow to the specific engine best
suited for tackling the data. And then the data has to be moved to the end
user in near real time. ``That puts a tremendous demand on the network,''
Baehr said.

    SGI scientist Chesson said that until users have routine access to
HIPPI, there are a variety of ways of accelerating graphics transfer
efforts, such as data compression.

Users Divided On Value Of X Terminals

By  PAUL KRILL



    San Jose-Dr. Stanley Nel, dean of arts and sciences at the University
of San Francisco, has had some second thoughts about the university's
decision last year to buy 30 X terminals instead of workstations for the
school's computer science and math departments.

    ``Everybody seems to be pointing to a distributed computing
environment as the paradigm for the future. For a distributed computing
environment, by definition one needs a local CPU,'' Nel said. Shrinking
prices are making workstations more viable than X terminals, he said.

    But Reginald Beardsley, of Plano, Texas-based ARCO Information
Services, said X terminals are ``fabulous,'' enabling him to log into
several different systems at once.

    ``For certain applications, I don't think that you can beat them,''
said Beardsley, whose company develops oil exploration software.


    Beardsley said he is responsible for release management of an internal
interface product on several different platforms. Sometimes he is logged
onto an IBM RISC System/6000, a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation, a Digital
Equipment DECstation and a Silicon Graphics workstation at the same time.
``I can just move from window to window firing off compiles,'' he said.

    The different viewpoints of Beardsley and Nel illustrate an
approaching dilemma: With the almost weekly introduction of new,
higher-powered X terminals and lower-priced workstations from major
vendors, users are finding themselves making difficult comparisons between
now similar technologies.

    San Jose-based Dataquest projects volume shipments of X terminals to
grow from 69,000 in 1990 to 861,200 in 1995. But workstation and X
terminal users remain divided over the usefulness of X terminals in
client/ server computing.

    X terminals eliminate a lot of system administration and are suitable
for users who do not need a lot of display bandwidth, Beardsley said. But
some believe they are a poor man's workstation and a return to the days of
timesharing.

    Meanwhile, proponents argue that X terminals are a low-cost seat for
users not requiring a compute-intensive desktop system. And the cost of a
fully configured workstation still makes X terminals a clear-cut cheaper
alternative, they say.

    ``I think [X terminals are] a better solution because you're able to
share the power of a workstation. All of your applications do not
necessarily require full-blown workstations,'' said Dennis Mahbeer, who
uses Hewlett-Packard X terminals as a CIM engineer at Northern Telecom in
Montreal.

    ``Just about everybody we have is on an X-Window terminal,'' he said.

     `If you don't need the CPU for one reason or another, [X terminals]
provide better performance in our experience than upgrading a PC or a
Mac.'    Mahbeer said the company uses the terminals as real-time shop
floor interfaces. The shop has about 90 terminals running off of four HP
9000 models 380 and 845 servers.

    To prevent bottlenecks between the terminals and servers, Northern
Telecom uses Ungerman Bass bridges that connect various segments of the
LAN and keep X packet traffic from going out over the whole network.

    The company has had some difficulties with X terminals. Mahbeer said
when the terminals were shut off and restarted, the server did not always
respond to it. Northern Telecom has been updating its X display manager
software to correct the problem, he said.

    Hamish Reid, a senior software engineer at Sybase, in Emeryville,
Calif., said X terminals are economical for the company. Reid said his X
terminal is connected to a Sun SPARCstation 1 and is used for database
development, programming and debugging.

    ``We have Sequents and workstations. We can't afford workstations for
everybody, but we have X,'' said Reid, who added he was not speaking for
the company.

    He said he did not see workstation prices ever being as low as X
terminal prices. But many engineers prefer workstations to X terminals, if
only for prestige, Reid said. Sybase uses NCD and Visual Technology X
terminals.

    X terminals consist primarily of a monitor, keyboard, mouse, X
graphics processor and X server software. Prices generally range from
about $985 for Visual Technology's X-14/es to $8,200 for a 19-inch color
IBM XStation 130. Workstations, priced as low as $5,000 in a diskless,
monochrome configuration, usually have all the facilities of X terminals
but add high-powered CPUs and disk drives. They can cost more than
$100,000 with various options included.

    Patty Chang, an analyst with San Jose-based Dataquest, said X
terminals are complementary to workstations and both should grow together.
``An X terminal is not designed for computing-intensive applications,''
she said. ``It's for multiple applications on one screen.''

    Bill Carrico, president and CEO of NCD, said X terminals are designed
to display the output of a server at a lower cost. ``Essentially, NCD aims
to have the X terminal cost one-half the list price of whatever the
comparable workstation would be,'' he said. Drew Davis, channels marketing
manager at Tektronix, said X terminals provide a specialized node in a
collective computing environment, offering a common standard user
interface to access network resources.

    However, a workstation user at a Midwest-based defense contractor, who
preferred anonymity, said his division frowned on X terminals after trying
some DEC terminals. ``They were using 80 percent of the CPU and doing
nothing,'' he said. The company wanted to use the terminals for software
engineering, but instead uses them for general office work.

    ``It makes more sense to us to spend the extra $1,000 or $2,000 and
buy a diskless workstation,'' he said.

    Phil Serra, a software analyst at Ivac, a San Diego-based medical
equipment builder, also had reservations about X terminals. ``The
performance is OK [but] if you're going to put a lot of them on the
server, it's really going to degrade the performance of the server,'' said
the Sun workstation user.

    Serra said X terminals can be used for viewing schematics and data and
checking functions. Designers, however, need either a workstation or an X
terminal with a powerful server, he said.

    ``The X terminal is sort of a step backward'' in that it reverts back
to a centralized computing paradigm, Serra said.

    Nel at USF said he has questioned the value of X terminals because of
their lack of independent processing power and what he sees as a
diminishing price difference vs. workstations. The university bought 30
IBM X terminals last year and connected them to a couple of IBM RISC
System/6000 servers.

    He said an X terminal is fine if a user needs high-intensity graphics
and can afford a $3,000 to $6,000 price tag. But a standalone system
provides distributed computing power.

    ``This is going to become even more of an issue as one finds the DOS
world, for example, supplying us with X-Window software,'' he said. A
system such as a 486-based Intel machine provides a low price point and
independent processing, Nel said.

    Beardsley, while an X terminal advocate, said they ``are still a
little bit on the pricey side.'' He added that running too many X
terminals off a server can cause system bottlenecks. There should be no
more than four terminals to a workstation, he said.

    Beardsley said he gave up a SPARCstation so he could keep an NCD X
terminal. ARCO Information Services also uses workstations from Sun,
Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics and other companies plus about a dozen
X terminals, which are being used mostly by summer hires.

    David B. Lewis, a partner in Lewis, Trachtenburg & Associates, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based X and Motif consulting house, said X terminals
provide the graphics necessary for software development or X development.
Their price advantage, though, is diminishing, he said.

    ``Some of the X terminals that are currently on the market are as
expensive as some of the workstations that you can pick up, and this is
increasingly true with some of the SPARC clones that are coming out,''
said Lewis, who has used a Visual X terminal in a network of Sun and DEC
hardware.

    ``If you don't need the CPU for one reason or another, [X terminals]
provide better performance in our experience than upgrading a PC or a
Mac,'' he said.

    Ira Winston, an X terminal user at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, said X terminals still are a substantial bargain when
compared to workstations. Prices of workstations are driven up sharply
when disk space and system administration costs are figured in, he said.

    Winston said he has an NCD X terminal at his home that links with a
SPARCstation workstation in his office. Students at the university use X
terminals for applications such as electronic mail, text processing and
office automation, he said. ``If they're running things that are not very
compute-intensive, then an X terminal is fine,'' he said.

Data General Breaks Clear

By  EVAN SCHUMAN



    Westboro, Mass.-Thanks to treble growth in sales of its Unix-based
computers and extensive cost-cutting, resulting in thousands of layoffs,
Data General has tallied up its second consecutive profitable quarter
after five years of unprofitability.

    With some Wall Street analysts saying financial figures released by
Data General suggest that the next several quarters will likely also be
profitable, this could very well mean a new lease on life for the onetime
all-but-written-off minicomputer maker. And many Wall Street analysts are
attributing the company's apparent turnaround to open systems.

    While it is not believed that two consecutive profitable quarters mean
the end of DG's financial difficulties, the news is expected to give the
DG sales force breathing room to sell to customers without having to
overcome the perception of imminent bankruptcy.

    The second-quarter earnings report showed a $19.2 million profit for
the quarter, compared with an $8.6 million loss for last year's identical
quarter. The report for the year's first fiscal quarter-announced at the
end of January-showed a $12.4 million profit, compared with a $20.5
million loss for last year's identical quarter.

    The second profitable quarter follows seven consecutive quarterly
losses for DG. Even before that, the company's financial results were
uneven, with quarterly losses mixed in with small quarterly profits. This
year's earnings reports follow five consecutive yearly losses that totaled
$428 million in net loss.

    ``There were certainly some viability issues last year,'' said Bill
Zastrow, DG marketing vice president for the company's AViiON
workstation/server Unix line.

    But the earnings were startling enough to prompt two of Wall Street's
more conservative investment houses-Smith-Barney and Salomon Bros.-to
upgrade DG stock to a buy recommendation.

    In Salomon's report to investors, analyst Steven Milunovich suggests
that the recommendation may catch investors by surprise. ``We are
upgrading the stock to a buy. Is that incredulity and skepticism we
hear?'' he wrote. ``Data General has reported two excellent quarters in a
row and analysts don't know what to do. Many of us had written off DG
along with Wang and Unisys.''

    Wall Street analysts and DG executives agree that DG's move into
profitability was achieved almost entirely through extensive cost-cutting
in research and development, sales and administrative. As is happening at
many companies today, exploratory projects-at least $10 million worth-were
canceled, and efforts were focused on core operations.

    While revenues have been mostly flat, analysts are satisfied that they
are not dropping. Indeed, AViiON sales have been steadily increasing while
the company's proprietary Eclipse MV product line have been falling,
numbers that have basically balanced each other out.

    ``They have got their costs in real good control and their revenue is
nudging through, and that's all you need,'' said Barry Bosak, Smith-Barney
managing director, who has also issued a buy advisory.

    ``I think the turnaround is real,'' said Salomon's Milunovich in an
interview, attributing much of the turnaround to DG's having made ``a
significant change in strategy to switch aggressively to open systems.''

    But Wall Street is not without its more conservative skeptics.

    ``The jury is still out,'' said Marc Schulman, a high-tech stock
analyst for UBS Phillips and Drew. ``They certainly don't belong in the
category of the Wangs and the Unisyses of the world anymore. DG will
survive, but will it survive and prosper?''

    Asked if the two good earnings reports mean that DG is in a financial
recovery, Merrill Lynch first VP George Elling said, ``It depends on how
you term recovery.''

    From an earnings perspective, he said, the company is generating more
than $300 million a quarter and has stabilized. ``But if you term recovery
in terms of whether they are growing the business, revenues grew only 1
percent,'' he said, adding that he ``would have to see some real signs
that the company is growing again'' before he would encourage people to
buy the stock.

    Elling points to staffing cut-backs from a mid-1980s com- pany high of
17,700 employees to the current 8,500, with the bulk of those layoffs in
the last two years.

    ``Can they grow with cutbacks in those areas?'' he asked. ``They took
humongous losses in the last two years,'' he said.

    UBS' Schulman credits DG executives with having hit on the correct
strategy. Not only have they focused in the area of open systems, but they
made becoming profitable an absolute priority, knowing that sales would be
hampered as long as potential customers feared DG would not be around a
few years down the road to support and upgrade today's purchases.

    Wall Street is also expecting even better financial reports from DG in
the near future because the revenue from some recent major contract
wins-including a U.S. Department of Interior contract worth as much as
$127 million and a $50 million U.S. Sprint deal-have not yet appeared in
any quarterly earnings. Also, DG is considered a front runner for two
major govern- ment contracts that have yet to be awarded: one from the
Army Reserve and one from the National Security Agency.

    What DG today considers its core strengths are the AViiON and
proprietary MV lines. Wall Street had always expected the proprietary
machines to die off as AViiON grew stronger, but what was not expected was
how slow a death that line is enduring.

    Smith-Barney's Bosak estimates that about 25 percent of the revenue
from the MV line is coming from new customers. Salomon Bros. estimates
that AViiON revenues have tripled from about $15 million in last year's
first quarter to $48 million for the current quarter, and Salomon projects
them to hit $65 million by this year's fourth quarter. Meanwhile, MV
revenues have dropped from about $158 million in last year's first
quarter, according to Salomon estimates, to about $134 million in the
current quarter, with $119 million projected for this year's last quarter.

    But unlike many of the other major RISC players, DG's AViiON strategy
is to focus almost entirely on servers under the rationale that a server
sale pulls workstations in with it. Servers also have higher profit
margins than workstations, but on the downside they need to be purchased
and replaced less frequently.

    ``Our point guard are the servers,'' said DG spokeswoman Stephanie
Bigusiak. ``The workstation market is quite full with players. We're not
so foolish to think that we can take that market over.''

    An unusual twist to the DG financial story is the resignation earlier
this month-after the announcement of the second favorable quarterly
numbers-of DG's chief financial officer, Michael Evans.

    While a CFO's resignation often signals a dissatisfied board of
directors, Evans has a strong reputation on Wall Street as a white knight
who goes into financially troubled companies, brings them to profitability
and then leaves for the next challenge.

    That's what he did at Commodore Intl., which he left in 1987 to come
to DG. Before that, he was CFO at RCA's Consumer Electronics Division, and
is now leaving DG to go to the G. Heileman Brewing Co., now in Chapter 11.

    Some are interpreting Evans' move as a sign that the hard part of DG's
financial recovery is over.

    ``I obviously am a person who likes challenges, and I am still
relatively young at 46,'' Evans said in an interview about his
resignation. ``I would have had a much more difficult decision to leave a
year ago.''

    He said that were he to have stayed at DG, the challenges would not be
as great.

    Evans characterized the DG that he arrived at as ``thoroughly
bureaucratic'' and ``bloated.'' His strategy was massive layoffs ``without
breaking the place'' and trying to maintain revenues. ``You had to be very
careful to still have the technology to bring out state-of-the-art
products,'' he said.

UI To Release Network Spec . . . -- Group's Proposed `Atlas' Distributed
Environment To Rival OSF's Net Strategy

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Parsippany, N.J.-Unix International intends next month to announce its
plans for a networking architecture to rival the Open Software
Foundation's own networking scheme, which is edging toward completion.

    The UI strategy is part of an overall plan called ``Atlas'' to expand
its system software beyond the OS, said David Sandel, UI's marketing VP.

    The upcoming announcement is part of a swirl of activity going on in
the area of network technology among UI, the OSF, and a Framingham, Mass.,
consortium, the Object Management Group:

    o  The OSF has narrowed the focus of its Distributed Management
Environment (DME) for managing software and peripherals over a network, as
the consortium moves toward an expected third-quarter announcement of what
technology it's selecting, said business-area manager Jonathan Gossels.
And the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), for running applications
over a heterogeneous network, is moving toward third-quarter release as it
goes into final testing over the summer.

    o  The OMG, a consortium of major hardware and software vendors, is
working for summer completion of its efforts to create standards for
object-oriented programming. OMG is also working to keep channels of
communication open between OSF and UI, to ensure that the three
organizations' object-oriented technologies can interoperate.

    The networking technologies are a source of new disputes between UI
and OSF, as UI claims that its technology is object-oriented while OSF's
isn't, and OSF claims that its technology is indeed object-oriented.
Meanwhile, OSF is claiming that UI has been cooperating on OSF's
specification for distributed systems management, while UI denies this.

    ``Unix International, over the last several months, has been taking a
close look at what it needs to do to put together an overall architecture
for distributed computing,'' Sandel said. ``We took the approach that we
needed an architecture, not just a set of technologies.''

    Technologies to be included in the architecture are distributed system
management, interfaces for migration from TCP/IP to OSI, transaction
processing services, security features, support for connection to PC and
DCE environments, IBM System Network Architecture (SNA) and
Hewlett-Packard Network Application System (NAS).

    Requirements put together by UI would be implemented by Unix System
Laboratories, Sandel said. Or vendors can write their own elements using
APIs made public by UI in the third quarter.

    In that respect, the UI proposal is like OSF's. OSF will provide
reference implementations of its DME and DCE technologies, and will also
publish APIs and test suites for vendors to write their own compliant
applications.

    UI reference implementations are expected to be available within six
to nine months.

    Technologies that could be included in the Atlas distributed
environment include Top End transaction processing from NCR, or Tuxedo TP
from USL, an OSI implementaton from Retix and Kerberos security. ``It's
not like we're going after brand-new technology,'' Sandel said.

    The UI technology will interoperate with the Object Management Group's
specifications for object technology, according to UI. The OMG is a
consortium of vendors including Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and
others, expected to release standards for object-oriented technology this
summer.

    Object-oriented technology is at the core of a dispute between OSF and
UI. UI claims its own Atlas will be object-oriented, while DCE is not.

    ``To have object-oriented technology, you have to have the notion of
objects. You have to have the ability to manage services. DCE does not
include that,'' Sandel said.

    But the OSF's Gossels said Sandel's claims were mere handwaving, that
Sandel was not operating with a precise decision of object-oriented
technology.

    ``It's easy to say a technology will be object-oriented, but since we
have to provide working software, we have to deal with real issues, such
as, `What does it mean, how will it really behave?' ''

    Meanwhile, OSF is moving forward on DME. The consortium agreed to
support both OSI Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and TCP/IP
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) standards for network mangement,
according to the OSF's Scope Document for the technology. Both CMIP and
SNMP would run on OSI or TCP/IP.

    The OSF has decided to exclude one area of technology it had initially
considered including: for backing up data over a network. Gossels said OSF
now considers backup technology too immature, evolving too quickly for the
consortium to standardize on.

 .  . . While OMG Mulls OOP Bids

    Framingham, Mass.-The Object Management Group expects this week to see
demonstrations of three technologies vying to be selected as foundations
for the organization's standard for object-oriented applications.

    Technology for the Object Request Broker is expected to be selected in
late July, after a recommendation by a task force at a June 4 meeting in
San Francisco, said Richard Soley, the OMG's vice president and technical
director.

    Technology submissions are in from NCR, Object Design, HP working in
conjunction with Sun, and Hyperdesk working together with DEC.

    The Object Request Broker would be the backbone of the OMG's work.
OMG's goal is to standardize technologies for software so software can be
constructed out of discrete modules-or ``objects''-which can be reused in
different applications.

    The ORB should pass requests between applications and objects.

    OMG is working with UI and OSF to ensure the technologies are
compatible. ``Down the road, it could turn into a competition, and that's
what we're trying to avoid,'' Soley said. ``That's in no one's interest.''

The SPARCs Are Flying Again With New Fujitsu Chip

    SPARC-compatible workstations operating at 29 MIPS and priced at
$5,000 could be on the market by fall, said officials at Fujitsu
Microelectronics, who plan tomorrow to announce a SPARC chip set on which
the systems would be based. The chip set will be offered in 33- and 40-MHz
versions for systems using VMEbus, Sbus or a busless architecture. Tony
Bozzini, marketing director for San Jose-based Fujitsu, said the chip
set's integrated design will enable systems integrators and
SPARC-compatible builders to offer 29-MIPS systems in the $5,000 price
range. Included in the chip set is Fujitsu's MB86903 IU/FPU, which
combines a floating-point processor and a SPARC integer unit on a single
chip. The set also includes APD's MB86921 Cache controller, Memory
management and Tag RAM chip, the CMT. Supporting cache sizes up to 256k
bytes, the CMT links the IU/FPU to the Mbus, a local processor-to-memory
interconnect that allows a system designer to reconfigure a design to
support faster CPUs and new peripherals as they become available. Samples
of the new chip set should be available by early summer. Prices begin at
$1,295 each, in quantities of 1,000 for a four-chip set for busless
designs.

English Molecular Visualization Package Coming To U.S.

    A British software product that until now has seen only limited,
academic use is expected to make its commercial debut tomorrow with the
unveiling of a port to Hewlett-Packard's Apollo 9000 Series 700
workstations. Ports to four other Unix platforms are also planned. PIMMS,
produced by U.K.-based Oxford Molecular, is slated to be announced
tomorrow. PIMMS is a GUI-based program, intended for use by pharmaceutical
companies, chemical engineers and materials researchers, that allows the
visualization and design of molecules. PIMMS will be ported to Silicon
Graphics and to RS/6000 machines by the end of the summer, and to
SPARCstations 1 and 2 by year-end, said David Marsh, Oxford Molecular's
technical manager. A port to FPS Computing's FPS 500
SPARCsupercomputer-the only supercomputer on which PIMMS will be
available-is planned for completion by year-end. The port has been delayed
by several months from its planned start date in February by FPS' pending
release of a new cross-compiler, Marsh said. On any of these platforms,
PIMMS can be licensed for 5,000 pounds (about $9,000) per 20 users, with
an additional 15 percent of the license fee for support and maintenance.

Netwise Adding More Wise To Its SNA Product

    Look for Netwise to roll out enhancements to its SNA connectivity
products in the fall or so, said Bill Jacobs, director of product
marketing. Netwise is the developer of a line of products based on Open
Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), allowing
applications to be written to run in modules spread over a network. The
company makes an RPC Tool for developing distributed applications on Unix,
Sun Microsystems and PC platforms as well as for System Network
Architecture (SNA) mainframes. Enhancements to the RPC Tool are expected
to address the fact that SNA has been implemented in different,
non-standardized fashions on non-Blue platforms. The new RPC tool is also
expected to tighten the link between TCP/IP on one hand and SNA networking
protocols such as Token Ring on the other. Netwise said that users will be
able to administer the technology remotely. Users will be able to choose
between command-line or graphical interface.

DEC, Intel Intro PC

By  MITCH WAGNER



    New York-Digital Equipment and Intel are expected tomorrow to come out
with a diskless 386 PC configured for networking, at least one laptop
computer and other networking products, officials with both companies
said.

    At a news conference featuring DEC Chairman Ken Olsen and Intel
President Andrew Grove, DEC will roll out a 26-to-27-MIPS PC priced
starting at about $6,000 in diskless configurations, targeted for use on a
network by commercial users, said two Intel sources.

    The PC will be configured to run SCO Unix Version 3.2, Unix System
V.4.2, OS/2 or DOS Version 3.3 or 4.01, one of the sources said. The
machine, which DEC is OEMing from Intel, will be available immediately,
sources said.


    It comes configured with 8 to 48 Mbytes main memory, with an
additional 16 Mbytes video RAM. It also comes configured with a SCSI bus,
for adding an external disk drive.

    The machine will be shipped with a high-resolution, VGA-compatible
1,280-by-1,024-pixel display.

    The laptop introduction will also be Intel architecture.

    The introduction follows the March 13 European announcement of laptops
from DEC based on the Intel i386SX and i386DX. Sources indicated that
Tuesday's announcement may be the American introduction of those machines.

    The PCs will not have support for DEC's Ultrix implementation of Unix
is not surprising, since Ultrix is currently configured to run only on
Mips RISC and VAX processors. On the Intel processor, DEC supports SCO
Unix implementations, with the ``applicationDEC'' line including 386 and
486 single-processor PCs, and the multiprocessor applicationDEC 433
running SCO Unix with multiprocessing extensions.

BT Revamps Unix OA Plan

    London-British Telecom has changed its plans to provide Unix-based
office automation for an estimated 30,000 users, after cutting short an
earlier project that was based on its own hardware.

    The company's BoaT OA project involves building a corporate network of
Unix servers linked by X.400 and supporting dumb terminals and PCs. Among
other features, it will allow BT to have E-mail across its offices
worldwide for the first time. BT is using Hewlett-Packard's NewWave and
OpenMail software, with Uniplex on the servers, so that it can integrate
PCs running Windows and DOS into the system.

     That level of PC integration was missing from an earlier attempt at a
Unix-based office system, called Coast, which was stopped last year.
Coast, which BT officials said still has about 1,500 users, was based on
Uniplex and dumb terminals. The hardware used was a Unix system called the
M5000 that BT was selling at the time.

     ``That didn't really address the PC community in BT,'' said Margaret
Harrison, BoaT customer services manager. The need to integrate PCs was
one reason BT decided to look for a different solution that would let PC
users stick with familiar applications but also give them new OA
facilities like E-mail.

     Another reason, she said, was that BT's Unix machines were capable of
supporting only 40 or so users apiece, but BT wanted to use more powerful
machines that could be supported by its computer services specialists.

     Under the BoaT program, BT has switched to using Unix systems from
outside suppliers. DEC, IBM RS/6000 and HP 9000 servers are being used for
three launch projects that are currently being implemented to support a
few hundred users. Harrison said no decision has yet been taken about the
servers that will be used to provide facilities for the thousands of other
prospective users.

     BoaT users will either use Uniplex via dumb terminals attached to
Unix servers or will have PCs that are linked to the servers. One
attraction of the HP software, Harrison said, was that low-end PCs could
run HP's AdvanceMail, while more powerful PCs could run the graphical
NewWave interface and NewWave Mail.

     Those PC mail systems will link to HP's OpenMail on the Unix servers,
which in turn will connect to a corporate X.400 network. Harrison also
noted that OpenMail, which is in the process of being integrated more
closely with Uniplex, is being ported to the IBM and DEC Unix systems.

    Uniplex officials said last year that Uniplex would get involved in
porting OpenMail to other systems and would get the two products to work
together more closely, initially by putting a Uniplex-style interface on
OpenMail.

    BT's plans to use HP and Uniplex software with a variety of hardware
follow an initial phase of BoaT that involved linking existing proprietary
IBM PROFS and DEC ALL-IN-1 OA systems via X.400.

Corrections

    One of the performance figures in a story about Silicon Graphics'
SkyWriter product, which appeared in the April 29 issue on p. 5, was
incorrect. It should have said that the product is capable of displaying
5,000 polygons per frame at 30 Hz with full texture mapping and filtering,
not 5,000 polygons per frame at 30 MHz.

    Also, in an article on p. 10 of the April 29 issue, Princeton
Information Ltd. was incorrectly identified as Princeton Associates.

IBM Slashes RS/6000 Prices

By  PAUL KRILL



    White Plains, N.Y.-IBM has cut prices by as much as 60 percent
throughout its RISC System/6000 workstation/server line and unveiled a new
compiler that raises the units' SPECmark performance.

    The move is viewed by some analysts and competitors as reactive to
market pressures.

    The largest price cut-$78,000-was to the model 550, which dropped in
price from $130,000 to $52,000. The price of the line's low-end model
320H, introduced in March, remained at $11,750, but the company is
including a 400-Mbyte disk drive instead of a 160-Mbyte drive. This
amounts to a $4,645 value, IBM said. Memory configurations were increased
on other systems, also.

    Unit prices listed by IBM include the system unit, memory and disk
storage and no monitor or graphical user interface. The price of the 320H,
for example, jumps to $17,972 when adding in facilities such as 19-inch
display, SCSI interface, keyboard, mouse, user interface and a FORTRAN
compiler.

    IBM announced a new version of its AIX XL FORTRAN Compiler/6000,
Version 2.2, which includes a new release of the AIX XL Run Time
Environment. The compiler will be available in September.

    The new compiler executes floating-point instructions faster than the
previous release, IBM said. Through use of the new compiler, new SPECmark
and floating-point ratings are as follows, with old ratings in
parentheses: model 320H, 41.2 SPECmarks, 66.8 SPECfp, (32.4, 45); model
520, 32.6, 52.9, (25.8, 35.7); models 530, 730 and 930, 43.4, 72.5, (34.2,
48.5); models 550 amd 950, 72.2, 119.7, (56.3, 79).

    Users who have the current FORTRAN compiler will get the new one free
of charge when it ships, according to Big Blue.

    Jeff Mason, IBM advanced workstations and AIX systems director, said
IBM dropped its prices in response to what customers wanted and to help
the company reach its goal of being the workstation market share leader by
1993. ``We've gone in and analyzed how customers use each of the machines.
We've gone into each environment and tried to tune them in the
marketplace,'' he said.

    Performance enhancements now on the drawing board involve stepping up
CPU clock rates, increasing the number of instructions in a clock cycle
and more compiler improvements, Mason said.

    Michael Goulde, analyst with Open Systems Advisors in Boston, called
IBM's announcement a clear reaction to Hewlett-Packard's new HP Apollo
9000 Series 700 workstation line. Those machines, with entry-level prices
of $11,990 and $19,900, score 57 MIPS and 76 MIPS and 55.5 SPECmarks and
72.2 SPECmarks. They were introduced March 26.

    ``There's nothing in the announcement today that reflects any change
in hardware. HP can certainly crank up its compiler technology to improve
performance as well,'' Goulde said. He said he expected price and
performance changes from Sun Microsystems and Digital Equipment also.

    DEC spokesman Dave Bouffard called IBM's announcement ``a beleaguered
attempt to maintain market mind share.''

    ``They can't match the HP price/ performance, and they still don't
have anywhere in their family a low-end, high-volume machine''

    for less than $10,000, he said. Bouffard said DEC this year plans to
introduce its own higher-performance workstations and already has
workstations selling for less than $10,000.

    IBM's price reductions, he said, could hurt sales of IBM's own
mainframes and midrange AS/400 accounts.

    HP spokesman Jim Barbagallo also called IBM's moves reactive to HP.
``If you look at specifications and pricing, they're still way off the HP
mark,'' he said.

    John Loiacono, a Sun spokesman, said Sun has no plans at present to
lower prices on workstations or servers. The company had no comment on
IBM's announcements.

    Mason said the announcements were made with competitiveness in mind
but not as a straight reaction to HP's 700 series.

    IBM also announced price reductions to its RS/6000 entry-level 3-D
color graphics adapters. New prices are $2,320 on 8-bit adapters and
$4,520 on the 24-bit adapters. Previous pricing was $10,400 for a 24-bit
unit and $4,160 for an 8-bit system. With an optional Z-buffer solid
rendering feature, the 24-bit adapter costs $4,520 and the 8-bit adapter
$3,995.

    IBM separately announced the availability of engineering quality
assurance software from Valisys on the RS/6000. Valisys lets engineers
validate CATIA (Computer Graphics Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive
Application) CAD drawings to ensure a part is being manufactured according
to specifications. CATIA is an IBM logo product made by Dassault Systemes
of Paris.

    Valisys, made by Valisys of Santa Clara, also is an IBM logo product.
The product previously was available on IBM mainframes and PS/2 systems.

    The Valisys software modules will be available from IBM in mid-June
priced from $8,500 to $10,155.

Game Firm Sues Secret Service

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Austin, Texas-A company that makes games and comic books is charging
that the U.S. Secret Service seized its computers and records, thus
paralyzing the business, because investigators suspected that one employee
might be engaged in computer crime.

    The lawsuit, filed by Steve Jackson Games, paints a picture of the
Secret Service as part comically incompetent and part Orwellian in its
crackdown.

    Jackson said that investigators burst into his office early on the
morning of March 1, 1990, took everything from PCs to disk drives to a
Ziploc baggie of miscellaneous screws, as part of an investigation into
computer crime. Almost all of the equipment has since been returned, said
Jackson, but the seizure resulted in irreversible publication delays.

    The Secret Service held onto the material about three and a half
months, until June 21, causing the company to miss a critical deadline,
which set off a financial chain reaction that still has the company
reeling, Jackson said. He was forced to lay off eight of his 16 employees.
The company now employs 12 people and has revenues of $1.2 million.

    More critical than the hardware was the data contained on hundreds of
1.2-Mbyte floppy disks, three computers with internal hard disk drives,
and three or four 40-Mbyte hard disk drives, Jackson said.

    Jackson's appeals to at least be able to make copies of his data went
unheeded by the Secret Service, except for the return of about nine
floppies containing five to six Mbytes of data in June 1990, Jackson said.
The data was largely useless to the company.

    Neither Jackson nor any of his employees were ever charged, he said.

    The lawsuit, filed May 1 in Federal District Court in Austin, seeks to
extend First Amendment free-expression protections to computer
communications. It charges investigators with violating the Privacy
Protection Act of 1980, which places strict limitations on the
government's powers to search publishers' offices; and the Electronic
Communications Privacy Act and Federal Wiretap Statute. It also charges
the government with violating Fourth Amendment guarantees against
unreasonable search and seizure.

    Named in the lawsuit are the Secret Service; Assistant U.S. Attorney
William J. Cook, of Chicago; Secret Service special agents Timothy M.
Foley and Barbara Golden; and Bell Communications research assistant
manager Henry M. Kluepfel, who assisted in the search. Bringing the
lawsuit along with Jackson are Elizabeth McCoy, Walter Milliken and
Steffan O'Sullivan, New Hampshire residents who are identified in the
lawsuit as users of a computer bulletin-board system the company ran,
called ``Illuminati.''

    The BBS, named for one of the Jackson games, was used by the company
to obtain product feedback.

    Backing the lawsuit is the Cambridge, Mass., Electronic Frontiers
Foundation, founded by Lotus Development founder Mitch Kapor. The group
portrays itself as a proponent of civil-rights protections for information
systems. It has been involved in defense of several computer-crime
suspects.

    The lawsuit charges that investigators took a book manuscript and the
computer used to run Illuminati, along with two other PCs and several disk
drives, and other equipment.

    At one point, Jackson appealed to several U.S. senators and
congressmen to have the data returned, according to the lawsuit. The
legislators-including Texas senator and 1988 vice-presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen-were falsely told by the Secret Service that the seized
property had been returned, according to the law suit.

    Jackson said he has not yet calculated the financial damages, but he
estimated they reached $125,000 by the time a month had passed. He added
he was shocked by the ignorance of computer technology that the agents
displayed. ``They literally had no idea of the difference between what a
computer could do in Star Trek and what a computer could do on your
desk,'' he said in an interview.

Morris Appeal Planned

    Washington-Attorneys for Robert Tappan Morris, the former Cornell
University graduate student convicted last year of unleashing the
so-called ``Internet Worm'' in 1988, have decided to appeal Morris'
conviction to the United States Supreme Court.

    ``I'm going to tell them the court was wrong,'' said Morris attorney
Thomas Guidoboni. Beyond that, he said, he had not formulated the grounds
for the appeal.

    The court could be expected by fall to decide whether to take the case
and, if the court takes it, it would likely be heard within about a year.

    A U.S. Court of Appeals panel upheld Morris' conviction in March.
Morris was convicted in January 1990 and later sentenced to serve three
years' probation, more than a year of which has already been served. He
was also sentenced to perform 400 hours' community service and pay a
$10,000 fine.

    Morris was convicted of one count of fraud for unleashing a worm virus
on the Internet in November '88, while he was a 22-year-old graduate
student.

    Thousands of Unix systems tied together on the Internet crashed when
Morris' worm duplicated itself uncontrollably due to a programming error.

    In order to convict someone under the computer fraud statute,
prosecutors must show that a defendant knowingly entered a system without
authorization and damage resulted.

    Guidoboni argued that Morris was not exceeding his authorized access
to Internet, but used common programs like sendmail and finger. The lower
court rejected those arguments.

Demax Tool Monitors System Security

By  MICHAEL FADEN



    San Mateo, Calif.-VMS security software specialist Demax Software
plans by year-end to ship a set of Unix security and network management
tools that the company says will constantly monitor system security.


    Demax has developed Unix equivalents of the security software it
currently offers on DEC VAX minicomputers running VMS and is preparing to
introduce the new software on June 6, along with Sun Microsystems. Product
manager Tanya Candia said the first version will run on Sun workstations,
followed by ports to other workstations.

    The current products include Securepak, a management tool for
individual machines that lets administrators build a ``baseline'' security
system and then monitor and analyze activity on the system, and Securemax,
a complementary product that is said to let administrators manage the
security of machines on a network from a single point.

    Candia added that the current goal of the product is to support
heterogeneous networks of Unix workstations and eventually to support
networks that include both VMS and Unix systems.

    Aiming at some new Unix sites with less Unix-expert administrators,
company officials stress what they say is a comprehensive and very easy to
use GUI design, based initially on Open Look.

    The product prompts the user along with step-by-step security
instructions, allowing the user to not have to worry about overlooking or
forgetting a step.

    While Demax President Kevin Kalkhoven said last week that Demax is
``still working on pricing,'' he estimated the product's annual cost
should range from about $100-for a standalone workstation added to an
already existing site-to $3,000, which would cover a server and up to 30
workstations.

    Demax, which says it sold about 3,000 copies of its VMS security
products, was prompted to develop Unix versions when some VMS customers
started sprouting networks of hundreds of Unix workstations, Candia said.
The firm showed customers prototype Unix software, on Sun workstations
running OpenWindows, that had 60 percent of the planned final product
functionality and was encouraged by the response to continue development,
she said.

Sun OKs VAR Clone Sales

    Mountain View-Clarifying its ``you can't sell SPARC clones if you sell
Sun machines'' policy announced last month, Sun Microsystems is now saying
that it will allow its resellers to send in the clones, provided the units
are either SPARC laptops or systems built under an OEM relationship with
Sun.

    Sun, to prevent channel conflict, last month began prohibiting Sun
resellers in the United States from also selling SPARC-compatibles, also
known as clones. SPARC laptops are being exempted because Sun itself does
not build any, while OEM systems are allowed because they are built
through partnering with Sun, company officials said.

    The rule means SPARC laptop vendors such as RDI, TriGem and Toshiba
and OEM firms such as Xerox can use the same reseller channels as Sun. RDI
qualifies under both exemptions: It buys system boards from Sun under an
OEM pact.

    Sun, in banning VARs from simultaneously selling both clones and Sun
systems, wants clone makers to broaden the base of SPARC by developing
their own channels, Sun spokesman John Loiacono said.

    Kam Chan, president of SPARC-compatible workstation builder Tatung
Science and Technology, called Sun's policy contradictory. ``They try to
open up the SPARC architecture. At the same time, they try to close up the
market,'' he said.

DEC RISC Box Gets Plaudits -- Most Beta-Site Users Pleased, Laud New
DECstation's Performance, Expandability

By  PAUL KRILL



    Mountain View-Digital Equipment's new RISC workstation has gotten good
reviews from its initial beta sites, with users touting the machine's
performance and daughter-card-based CPU upgrade strategy.

    The new DECstation ``met all of our expectations,'' said Brad Krebs, a
programmer analyst in the CAD Center at the University of California,
Berkeley.

    ``We liked the speed, we liked the expandability of it and being able,
when the next version of the CPU comes out, to replace it with a daughter
card instead of having to replace the whole damn box.''

    DEC late last month introduced two new workstations, the DECstation
5000/120 and the DECstation 5000/125, to fill a price gap between the
company's high- and low-end machines. Code-named ``3MIN,'' the units
feature daughter-card upgrade paths that will enable CPU swaps through the
replacement of pocket-sized daughter cards.

    Model 120, priced at $6,495 in a diskless configuration, features a
20-MHz Mips R3000A RISC processor. The box runs at 13.9 SPECmarks, 21.7
MIPS and 2.6 MFLOPS. Model 125, in a diskless base configuration costing
$8,495, has a 25-MHz R3000A and is rated at 16.4 SPECmarks, 26.8 MIPS and
3 MFLOPS. Various graphics options are available for each model.

    Krebs said the college used a model 125 with 128 Mbytes of memory as a
CPU server, for use in designing integrated circuits. He noted the
system's 50-Mbytes-per-second Turbochannel I/O bus was slower than the
100-Mbytes-per-second I/O of the DECstation 5000/200, but this did not
affect users.

    Tom Furlong, DEC RISC workstations manager, said the slower
Turbochannel bus was sufficient for the unit and was used to keep price at
a minimum. The 50-Mbytes-per-second system only needs one bank of dynamic
memory, while a 100-Mbytes-per-second unit needs at least two, he said.

    Krebs said the university has ordered 20 of the new workstations.

    Katy Moore, platform marketing manager at beta user Autodesk, said the
CPU upgrade paths are important to the company's AutoCAD software users,
who upgrade systems as new versions of AutoCAD are developed. She said the
workstation was fast and ``seemed to be reliable.''

    Not all reaction was glowing, however. One beta user, who asked that
his name and company affiliation be withheld, called the 3MIN box ``just
another workstation.'' He had a model 120 that was used for application
development.

    The user noted the new workstation lacks the power of
Hewlett-Packard's new HP Apollo 9000 Series 700 workstations, which run at
57 MIPS and 76 MIPS in different configurations.

    ``If I had my choice, at the present moment I'd probably look
seriously at HP,'' he said.

    A beta user at Chevron Information and Technology of La Habra, Calif.,
who also requested his name be withheld, said the new workstation was
faster than a model 3100. But he said DEC's $3,995 upgrade program to
convert a model 3100 into a model 120 was too expensive. The model 3100 is
rated at 11.8 SPECmarks, 16.2 MIPS and 1.7 MFLOPS.

    ``For $4,000, it's a lot of money for not much improvement,'' he said.

    The user said he disliked Ultrix because it was less standard and did
not write to disk as fast as Sun's SunOS.  He also said he was
dissatisfied with the performance of the model 3100. He did, however like
the X-Window performance of the DEC system.

    Kevin Scully, systems and technology manager at Sumitomo Bank Capital
Markets in New York, said he was pleased with the memory expandability of
the model 120, which can hold as much as 128 Mbytes of RAM. He said he
tested a unit but was not a beta user. He also liked the CPU upgrade path.
Sumitomo plans to order 96 3MIN boxes for its London and New York offices,
he said. ``We think that Digital is just going to have a winner with
them,'' he said.

New NCD Machines Double As Character Terminals

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Mountain View-Network Computing Devices has rolled out two new X
terminals that it says aren't really X terminals at all.

    The new MWT15b and MWT19 monochrome terminals-which are not suited for
graphics-contain both client and server X software located within the
desktop units. What that means, said NCD executive vice president Judy
Estrin, is that users can utilize the products in place of ASCII
terminals. Users can run multiple windows of character applications within
the X terminals.

    Priced starting at nearly $1,700, the two X terminals are far more
expensive than the character terminals they are designed to replace, which
can be had for less than $400. Larger installations might also require a
terminal server, priced at several thousand dollars.

    But Estrin said the price of the MWTs is worth it for users who are
committed to making the switch to X-but not switching immediately.

    ``If they're going to go to X over the next year or two, they can make
a hardware investment now, and the hardware investment is safe. You make
the hardware investment now, and later you turn on software code, and it
turns on X.''

    Another reason to buy the multiwindow terminals is if the capacity to
run several sessions in windows on a single screen is very important,
Estrin said. That kind of capacity can save seconds per call in a
telephone order-entry operation. Those kinds of time savings can add up
pretty fast, she said.

    ``Even hot-keying between different screens is different from having
multiple windows and being able to cut and paste between windows,'' she
said. The terminal can be connected to an Ethernet network via
twisted-pair or ThinWire Ethernet connection, replacing an ASCII terminal
without requiring any changes to host software or applications. Each
window on the X terminal emulates a VT220 terminal session.

    The terminals are designed to  offer a practical migration path for
users planning to eventually make use of X-Window technology. The new
desktop products can be made into true X terminals, capable of simple
graphics processing, by changing the software, Estrin said.

    The MWT15b is priced at $1,695 and the MWT19 at $3,400.

    ``There's a lot of users that, when you say X, they get nervous and
say, `Oh, that means I have to do host upgrades,' '' Estrin said.
``Because our terminals have the local window manager and software, you're
able to get a step closer to the network computing X model without having
to take the full step yet. The hardware lets you know that, in the future,
all you have to do is flip a software switch and you're there.''

    Users can upgrade the Multi Window Terminals to regular X terminals
simply by changing software, paying a $50 software license to NCD, said a
company spokeswoman.

    The 15-inch model makes use of the same hardware platform as the
company's low-end NCD15b, while the 19-inch model uses the same hardware
as the company's midrange NCD19. The 15-inch model offers
1,024-by-800-pixel resolution, and the 19-inch has 1,280-by-1,024
resolution.

    The NCD15b is priced at $1,495, $200 less than the MWT15b because it
has 2 Mbytes less memory. The NCD19 has the same price as the MWT19.

    The terminals can be used for transaction processing, database,
spreadsheet, word processing and other office automation applications,
according to NCD.

    Users can cut and paste text between windows, resize them and iconify
them. The terminals can use the look-and-feel of Motif or Microsoft
Windows 3.0. They have a 70-Hz refresh rate and a 13-by-13-inch footprint.
Both of the models have 4 Mbytes of RAM. The terminals will be available
30 days after receipt of order.

Team Plans ONC RPC Net Utilities

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Mountain View-Five networking companies have banded together to
develop base-level networking utilities around Sun Microsystems' Open
Network Computing system of Remote Procedure Calls, with the goal of
coming out with mail and print-sharing facilities by the time of the
October Interop show.

    ``The basic premise is that we want to be able to produce an
equivalent to the PC-based network operating systems that are out there,
providing all the features, and do it on an open architecture,'' said Carl
Beame, president of Beame & Whiteside, Ontario, Canada, one of the five
companies involved in the effort.

    The other companies are Interlink, FTP Software, Intercon and TGV
Software. In an effort to keep the group lean, they have no offices, no
full-time professional staff nor even a name, Beame said.

    The utilities will be protocol-independent, and source code for the
Unix reference implementations would be made public, Beame said.

    All five companies specialize in offering TCP/IP and Network File
System (NFS) implementations for non-Unix operating systems. Beame &
Whiteside runs it for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. TGV, in Santa Cruz,
Calif., specializes in Digital Equipment VAX/VMS. FTP, which is in
Massachusetts, has offerings for DOS and OS/2. Intercon, in Herndon, Va.,
specializes in Apple Macintosh computers. Interlink, meanwhile, offers NFS
and TCP/IP for IBM MVS systems.

    FTP, Intercon, TGV and Beame & Whiteside already offer mail programs.
``What we provide is not suitable for connectivity to anything but Unix,''
Beame said. ``What we want to provide are the services over the common
base that's best for all concerned.''

    The mail- and print-sharing services will serve as a sort of test for
the organization, said David Kashtan, president of TGV Software. He said
if the companies can't succeed in bringing those technologies to fruition
by October, he'll favor abandoning the team.

    But if the October deadline is met, he said he'd favor moving on to
produce timing, authentication and other services. Among these would be
facilities for sharing devices. A Unix system, for example, would be able
to read and write data directly to a VMS disk drive, Kashtan said.

    In an effort to keep the group lean, the companies have no offices, no
full-time professional staff nor even a name.

        The services would provide a uniform look-and-feel and API over
different operating systems. They will run on top of X-Window, Kashtan
said.

    The group is not in competition with the Open Software Foundation,
which is trying to standardize basic network functions, Beame said.
``People will see us as competition. That's not our intent. We're not here
to provide standards. We're here to provide real-world applications,''
Beame said. ``But if we both end up providing the same functionality,
then, yeah, I guess we'll be in competition.''

    The technologies being worked on by the five-company group do not
overlap or compete with OSF work, say sources at the group and at OSF.

    The ONC RPCs were chosen because the technology is what the companies
are already familiar with, Kashtan said. OSF has standardized on
Hewlett-Packard RPCs for inclusion in its Distributed Computing
Environment (DCE).

Hong Kong All-in-One Bank Information

        Liu Chong Hing Bank in Hong Kong is developing an application that
uses Oracle products under Unix to give managers constantly updated,
unified information on all customer accounts. Currently, the bank tracks a
customer's loan, mortgage, savings, foreign exchange and other accounts
separately so that a customer's financial profile must be assembled
manually. ``This will give our managers a complete picture of client
portfolios, which will help them make quick, accurate decisions on loans
and other matters,'' said Sampson Tong, the bank's data processing
manager. The application, called the Customer Information File, will be
crafted using Oracle's SQLoForms, SQLoPlus and SQLoReportwriter, running
on an NCR Tower 32/700 configured as an additional application processor
on the bank's proprietary NCR mainframe. The Customer Information File
will be available for use by managers at the bank's 29 Hong Kong branches,
as well as those in San Francisco and Shanghai. Plans call for customers
eventually to be able to access information on their own accounts.

In Russia, SCO Goes From Bootlegged To Bona Fide

    As long as bootleggers are already widely distributing Santa Cruz
Operation products throughout the Soviet Union, SCO thought it might as
well get a few legitimate dollars from the generated interest. SCO has
announced its first distributor in the Soviet Union, Moscow-based Future
Technology International. FTI, which is 70 percent owned by an Austrian
company and 30 percent owned by the Soviet Informpribor Institute, will
sell and support the complete range of SCO products in the Soviet Union.
Software is widely bootlegged in the Soviet Union, and at least two
companies are openly selling illegal copies of SCO Xenix, complete with
photocopied documentation, SCO said. Plans call for FTI to deal in hard
currencies initially, with the possibility of sales in rubles in the near
future.

Frame And Matsushita Say Kanji Is A Can-Do

    Frame Technology has revealed the fruits of its joint development
agreement with Matsushita Computer Systems with the rollout of the
Japanese version of its workstation publishing software. The new software,
called Japanese FrameMaker, is a Japanese-language version of its
FrameMaker 2.1 product and allows users to create and edit business and
technical documents in both Japanese and English, Frame officials said.
Some of the key capabilities of the product are a front-end processor that
allows the phonetic Japanese characters, called Hiragana and Kanji
characters, to be entered with a English keyboard. In addition, the
software has Japanese word processing and graphics standard formats and
provides support for the Japanese Industrial Standard character set of
Kanji characters. The product is currently available in Japan from
Matsushita and runs on Panasonic BE workstations running under the
X-Window System. Frame says that, within 30 days, versions for Sun
Microsystems and Solbourne computers will be available. The software costs
585,000 yen (about $4,300) for a single floating license.

Kubota Unveils New Workstation

    More support for the Mips RISC chip can now be found in Japan, with
the introduction of Kubota Computer's new high-end Unix-based workstation,
capable of 25.1 SPECmarks and 4.6 MFLOPS of peak processing performance,
Kubota officials said. The workstation, called the RS3330, is based on
Mips Computer Systems' R3000A RISC chip and runs Mips' RISC/OS 4.5 Unix
system software. The workstation features 128 Mbytes of memory and can
utilize 600 Mbytes of internal disk storage and 6.2 gigabytes of external
disk storage. The workstation comes with a 17-inch monochrome CRT display
and costs 1.97 million yen (about $14,275).

NETWORKING

If you work with the private sector, OSI might be something
nice that may someday improve or replace TCP/IP. If you work with the
government, OSI is a requirement. As they did with Unix, the bureaucrats
are demanding systems that talk OSI for new purchases.

    Let's look at how two PC network companies are dealing with this. When
I say look, I don't mean look at the physical stuff. As the joke goes, the
data sheets are shipping in volume, with product to follow. But people
swear to me this stuff is shipping-just not very much yet.

     Novell, with its new NetWare 386 Version 3.11, has an optional FTAM
(File Transfer Access and Management) module that runs on the server. This
is a responder only, and provides services like file transfer and printing
to FTAM clients. Unix naming conventions are followed, and FTAM initiators
can send, retrieve, print to Novell printers, delete, rename and read
files on the server. No mention is made of security control; surely Novell
doesn't expect FTAM users to need a NetWare user name and security
profile. Attached Novell PC users don't get access to any other FTAM
services on the network.

    This method fits with Novell's other recent releases in that NetWare
is still proprietary while providing open hooks for everyone else. As
Novell has the largest PC LAN installed base to consider, it will follow
this plan for a while. And if all new products are open and older products
are opening more and more, we have to be satisfied for now.

     Directly opposite Novell's position is 3Com (once again). While it
isn't selling the Network Operating System anymore (LAN Manager/3+Open was
given back to Microsoft, remember), it is staying active in the protocol
business.

     3Com's approach is to provide a PC OSI stack that can be loaded and
unloaded from memory when needed. All the features of its fine TCP/IP DPA
(Demand Protocol Architecture), such as Virtual Terminal, third-party
terminal emulator support, file transfer and the ability to unload RAM
when you're finished, are in the OSI package. The underlying code came
from Retix, an early OSI company, so compatibility should be no problem.
This software will work with earlier LAN Manager versions sold by 3Com and
with the newest Microsoft 2.0 version.

     With the 3Com software available either today or ``real soon now,''
you will be able to run TCP/IP, NFS, OSI, NetBIOS and Novell's IPX all at
the same time. You may not have any RAM left for an application, but you
can transfer files to and fro until your network screams for mercy.

     Are you going to run OSI as the primary protocol on your local
network? Probably not, at least not for a few more years. You may soon
need to connect to random OSI hosts, however, and the 3Com option will let
you do that more easily than the Novell option.

     It seems that OSI is slowly but surely making inroads. It's been
sneaking in with the routers and mail systems, and now your PC can speak
OSI and your server FTAM. It's a start.

The Rise Of OSI -- Users Showing Increasing Interest In Potential Of X.400

By  MICHAEL FADEN



    Fourteen years ago, a bunch of standards experts at an International
Standards Organization meeting in Sydney, Australia, decided that OSI
should be invented. Given that many say OSI has only started to spread
through the Unix world, one may at some point wonder why they bothered.


     Some vendors say that one big problem holding back the spread of OSI
is that the set of OSI protocols hasn't, up till now, really solved many
problems or offered any capabilities that you couldn't get some other way.

     Within the Unix world, TCP/IP has offered many of the advantages of
being able to network machines from different vendors that OSI is supposed
to deliver.

     Even while vendors started providing OSI on their Unix systems, some
have been recognizing the widespread adoption of the TCP/IP protocols by
implementing them on proprietary operating systems, providing another way
to link together incompatible machines. In some areas, the capabilities of
TCP/IP still outstrip OSI equivalents.

     ``With TCP/IP, you can have routers dynamically build tables. With
OSI, you don't have that, the protocol is not finalized, so you find that
you cannot build a large network dynamically,'' said Lloyd Spencer,
product manager at Sun's international center for network computing in
Grenoble, France.

     However, because the IEEE standard versions of Ethernet and Token
Ring have been adopted by ISO as OSI standards, in theory huge numbers of
people are using OSI in some form already.

     Also, in Europe, the X.25 wide-area OSI networking protocol was
supported by most national phone companies and turned out to be a better
option for many users than leasing phone lines, so that has also boosted
the number of people that are already using OSI.

     What most people mean by OSI, however, is the software that runs on
top of those basic carriers and provides everything from general transport
mechanisms to sophisticated, specialized ``application-level'' services.

     The services that actually start to provide useful and sometimes new
capabilities, vendors say, will be one of the main reasons users
eventually start buying OSI. A more immediate reason may be the
specification of OSI in government procurements.

     If one looks at the expected takeup of various OSI services, it
becomes clear that some of them are likely to take off much faster than
others. According to a recent OSI study by London consultants Ovum, by
1995 suppliers will be required to support the X.400 standard for carrying
E-mail and other information in 48 percent of shipments to large
organizations in the U.S., Britain, France and Germany.

     X.500, a directory standard that has attracted a lot of attention
recently and is often considered to be closely linked with X.400, will be
required for 23 percent of shipments, even though vendors are only now
starting to get products into the market, according to Ovum. Both X.400
and X.500 were originally defined by a committee of telecommunications
carriers called the CCITT.

     In contrast, the OSI Virtual Terminal protocol for connecting remote
terminals to different machines will be required in a mere 7 percent of
shipments, according to the study.

     One reason the expected takeup for X.400 is so high, vendors say, is
that it solves a problem that's widespread, even endemic in large
organizations, namely getting mail between incompatible systems.

     Large organizations often need a mechanism for getting mail between
IBM SNA mainframe networks, TCP/IP minicomputer nets, and Novell PC LANs,
for instance, observed John Stephenson, senior vice president of Retix,
which claims to have around 160 OEMs for its Unix OSI software.

     ``Right now, major corporations see it as a solution to a big
problem, connecting mainframes and PCs,'' said Paul Madden, president of
Alfalfa Software, supplier of a mail package that runs over both X.400 and
the SMTP mail protocol used with TCP/IP.

     ``SMTP really hasn't been accepted as a solution for corporate
E-mail,'' Stephenson said. ``It's still not available on every machine in
the corporate net.''

     To solve that problem of connecting incompatible mail systems, a lot
of vendors say they are currently backing the gateway approach. Companies
will sell you a gateway box, or software that runs on a machine you have
already, that takes proprietary mail and converts it into X.400 format.
Then, that mail could be carried on an X.400 ``backbone'' or over one of
the X.400 public mail networks that are now provided by most of the main
public carriers to another gateway box. The second gateway is connected to
another proprietary mail network and converts the X.400 mail to the new
proprietary format. Each gateway can sometimes deal with a number of
different proprietary formats.

     SoftSwitch, Wayne, Pa., offers turnkey systems based on software and
gateway boxes that it says will translate mail to and from IBM mainframe
office systems, DEC's ALL-IN-1, PC local-area network mail systems like
Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail, and Unix/SMTP mail. Coincidentally, the
gateways themselves run Unix System V, Release 3 on 80386 processors.

     Touch Communications sells gateway software that runs on Interactive
Unix systems. Typically, said Touch product manager Vince Hunt, those
could be used to take mail from proprietary PC LANs out into an X.400
network.

    Vendors say the advantage of the gateway approach is that end users
don't have to learn anything new. They can just keep using their familiar
mail systems, except now they can send mail to people on other kinds of
mail systems.

     Many vendors, including HP and Unisys, say they have X.400 software
available under Unix, so in theory one could build an X.400 Unix-only
network. Vendor OSI groups like Osinet and Eurosinet also stage X.400
demonstrations based largely on Unix to show that their systems really can
talk to each other. Those suppliers that haven't already delivered X.400
Unix products plan to do so.

     DEC will implement X.400 as part of its DECnet Phase V release before
the end of the year; in the meantime, Ultrix users would have to route DEC
proprietary mail messages through a VMS-based X.400 router, officials
said. IBM has issued a statement of direction that it will support X.400
on its AIX Unix systems.

           Currently, X.400 provides no big advantages over RFC822 (SMTP)
and may even have some disadvantages, said Steve Kille, project manager at
University College, London, which is involved in developing and
proliferating a stack of freely available OSI software called the ISO
Development Environment. The ISODE, based on a core of software originally
developed by Marshall Rose, now with Performance Software International,
includes X.400 and X.500 software and has been incorporated into a number
of commercial products including those from the Wollongong Group and Sun
Microsystems.

     The reasons that people are getting involved are the potential future
capabilities of X.400, like multimedia and security, he said. There are
X.400 pilots on the Internet and in European countries, Kille added.

     The components of X.400 include Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) that
typically run on a local minicomputer or server and are responsible for
routing and storing mail messages to other MTAs. Communicating with those
are User Agents, the mail applications that let the user format, send and
retrieve messages from their local MTA. Today, those applications are
often replaced by gateway software that shuffles mail to and from a
proprietary mail system.

     In the future, X.400 applications and even proprietary applications
will take advantage of a key design feature of X.400: the ability to carry
much more than text messages.

     ``X.400 allows you to have enclosures that are recognized by X.400
and hold image, ASCII, the extended character sets used in European
languages, and reformattable documents [like spreadsheets or formatted
word processor documents],'' said Stephenson of Retix. ``But when you look
at the products [today], they are pretty much restricted to textual
messages at this point.''

     ``There's probably a four to five times greater demand for X.400 than
for FTAM [OSI file transfer],'' said Sun's Spencer.

     ``I think there are going to be a couple of really important
applications. One is the usage of X.400 with EDI. A lot of companies are
looking at EDI for commercial applications; they are looking at building a
retail business on EDI. I think X.400 will become the primary carrier [for
that information].''

     EDI, another OSI standard, is a protocol for carrying various kinds
of business information like purchase orders.

     Every four years, the CCITT produces a new version of the X.400
standard. The products in use today, and the services provided by public
carriers, are almost all based on the X.400 1984 standard, but 1988
compliant products are starting to emerge.

     ``'88 has some advantages, like making it easier to define new
document types, but the primary reason [for moving to it] is security,''
said Stephenson. ``'84 had essentially no security features.''

     Retix announced an '88 X.400 source code product for OEMs earlier
this year. Wollongong has an '88 product in alpha test, said Doug Ambort,
Wollongong product manager.

     Although the use of X.400 today is still relatively small, Stephenson
said that picture will change soon. ``What you'll really see happening in
the next year is that large users will start to deploy reasonable-sized
networks,'' he said. ``You'll see many large networks a year and a half
from now.'' He classified a large network as having at least 50 MTAs that
could represent several thousand end users.

     Several vendors said they don't plan to try and offer X.400 over
TCP/IP, but Sun is an exception. Spencer said, Sun can currently run FTAM
over TCP, and the company will continue that way with X.400. He declined
to give detailed product plans or delivery dates.

     The X.500 directory standard has also started to feature in vendors'
strategy and product announcements, and is being described as a technology
that, like X.400, could play a role throughout an organization. Also like
X.400, people are already talking about using it much more widely than a
directory that is used just to store mail addresses and simplify the task
of directing mail to other people.

     ``Basically if you look at existing proprietary E-mail systems, they
all have some kind of directory,'' said Stephenson. The problem is that
like the mail formats themselves, the directories are not compatible, a
problem that implementing X.500 across the board could solve.

     The X.400 '88 standard introduced a standard set of rules for
accessing X.500 directory information, to make it easier to build products
that work together. However, vendors say X.500 could have a much wider
application than just acting as a mail directory.

      ``People view X.500 as literally a telephone directory where you can
store any kind of information. For instance, there's an example where a
company is thinking of using it as an organizational chart builder,'' said
Spencer.

     Retix officials said phone companies could set up yellow pages-type
directories that could be used as the basis of a business information
service.

     When the Open Software Foundation was planning to come out with
directory and naming services as part of the Distributed Computing
Environment due later this year, OSF members ``advised us very clearly''
to make it X.500-compliant, said Jonathan Gossels, OSF business
development manager.

     OSF officials said that because you can look for objects in the
directory by searching on particular attributes, you could store printer
names and look for high-speed or color printers on the network for a
particular printing task.

    Walt Tuvell, a technical consultant at OSF, claimed that the OSF
technology adds proprietary features that remedy some of the gaps in the
current '88 X.500 standard. ``The X.500 standards do not specify
replication or caching or security,'' he said.

    ``We expect the 1992 standard will fix those [replication and security
areas],'' said Spencer, indicating that Sun would not wait till then to
introduce a product.

    According to Kille at UCL, a pilot worldwide directory system based on
X.500 has already taken off in a big way. About 400 organizations in 15
countries are participating in the pilot, he said. Some are using an X.500
implementation called Quipu that is part of the ISODE, others are using
other X.500 implementations, Kille added.

     Because OSI communications standards are meant to be independent of
OSes and programming languages and do not include any standard
applications programming interface, common APIs for X.400 and X.500 have
been slower to arrive than the software itself.

          Retix co-founded a group called the Application Programming
Interface Association that has been defining APIs for these OSI protocols,
Stephenson said. Some vendors have charged that the APIA was dominated by
Retix and that the association's X.400 API is based closely on the Retix
API. Some software, like the ISODE and Wollongong's products based on the
ISODE, does not support the APIA interface, the developers said.

     Hunt, at Touch Communications, agreed the API is based on Retix, but
said it has also been adopted by X/Open and that Touch is implementing it
in addition to its own API.

     Other vendors are using the API to build gateways or interfaces from
mail systems, Retix officials said. Among them is HP, which claims that
its OpenMail is one of the first products to include X.400 addressing and
formatting into its core architecture.

     Last year, HP and Uniplex got together to port OpenMail to non-HP
Unix platforms including DEC and IBM, and Uniplex officials said the first
ports are nearing completion.

     In the future, Stephenson said, vendors of other kinds of
applications will develop software that integrates X.400 and operates as
an X.400 user agent talking directly to an X.400 MTA.

     ``Non-E-mail vendors, spreadsheet companies, will come out with
products that attach to X.400. You would pull up a menu in a spreadsheet
package and one of the options would be mail,'' he said.

     The spreadsheet vendors will register their spreadsheet formats so
spreadsheets can be carried over X.400 and uniquely identified by the
receiver. A message can contain information from several different
applications, so when it is received, those applications can be triggered
automatically to let the receiver see the different parts of the message,
whether spreadsheet, text or image, he said.

X Server Tool For DOS PCs

    Anaheim, Calif.-Integrated Inference Machines is offering X server
software for MS-DOS PCs allowing users to save money by licensing the
software over the whole network, rather than on a per-copy basis.

    Multiuser X.11/AT 3.2 X-Window System Server software incorporates a
license manager and can be downloaded to DOS PCs from Unix or Novell
fileservers, or any platform that supports Network File System (NFS) or
DOScopy protocols.

     The license manager keeps track of the number of copies of the X
server that are in use at any given time. The user pays for a maximum of
20, 50, 100 and 250 or more ``floating users.''

    The X software runs on Microsoft Windows 3, said Charles Ross, IIM
senior VP. The software now incorporates TCP/IP drivers.

    It allows concurrent access from remote X applications and local MS
Windows applications, and cut-and-paste of text and images between X
applications and MS applications.

    IIM has tested the software to run on Novell NetWare, SCO Unix, SunOS
and Intel Unix.

    It is available immediately, priced for a 20-user license at $7,900,
plus an optional $1,000 maintenance and upgrade fee; $17,900 for a 50-user
license plus $2,500 annual maintenance; $29,500 for a 100-user license,
plus $4,000 annual maintenance; and $59,900 for a 250-user license, plus
$7,500 annual maintenance.

    On a per-user basis, that translates to $238 per user for 250 users,
and scales to $395 per user for 50 users. Most X server software packages
for DOS PCs sold on a per-copy basis sell for $450 or more.

    IIM is at 714-978-6776.

Four DECnet/SNA Links Premiere

By  MITCH WAGNER



    Maynard, Mass.-Digital Equipment has rolled out new communications
products designed to provide DECnet users with enhanced connectivity into
the world of Big Blue mainframes.

    The DECnet/SNA Data Transfer Facility Version 3.0 allows users on
DECnet systems to access data on IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
computers using DECnet calls, while IBM users use SNA calls to get into
DEC Ultrix, VMS and RSX machines, as well as MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, said
Jane Brewer, DEC's IBM interconnect marketing manager.

    ``It's a file-transfer and information-access environment,'' said
Brewer. ``It connects to the two environments and lets users in each
environment initiate file transfers using the commands that they're used
to.''

    The facility is ideal for situations where systems administrators need
to put longstanding VMS or Ultrix operations in touch with each other.

    ``Our users tend to be comfortable working with what they're used to,
which is SNA-oriented,'' said Brewer. ``They tend to be large corporate
data centers which have large investments in SNA. Manufacturing and
scientific arms of those organizations have VMS and Ultrix. Now people are
saying, `Let's integrate it. We don't want to have multiple copies of
everything.' ''

    The products, which are expected to be available next month, come in
four components:

        DTF Server is the software package that controls all requests for
information and includes fail-safe functionality. It runs on a VMS
platform, starting at $1,510 for the VAXstation, increasing in price to
$22,100 for the VAX 6410 and reaching $63,200 for the VAX 9000 mainframe.

    DEC Utilities includes remote management features and other fail-safe
functionality. It is priced at $640 for a low-end VAXstation, $9,480 on
the VAX 6410 and $27,000 for the mainframe VAX 9000.

    The DTF software module that runs on the MVS machine is priced at
$30,900, and the software module running on the VMS machine is priced at
$21,000.

    DEC also offers two 2.2-Mbps pay-one-price packages featuring server,
IBM software and the DECnet/SNA Gateway CT, which actually passes data
from the DECnet to SNA environments. The packages are priced at $60,000
for MVS systems and $50,000 for VM systems, independent of which VMS
platform they run on.

    Digital has also introduced a new terminal server and router.

    The DECserver 300 Version 2 terminal server, supporting 16 ports,
allows users to run Local Area Transport (LAT) and telnet sessions
simultaneously, said Lee Cooper, network marketing manager.

    The server software can be downloaded from a PC running MS-DOS and
DEC's PC networking software, Pathworks 3. Until now, software was
downloadable only from a VAX. ``Now you have a low-cost alternative to
give the department local control over the terminal server,'' said Cooper.

    Ultrix pricing for the standalone software is $616, while VMS pricing
is set at $647. The software will also be bundled with future sales of the
DECserver 300, the company said. Pricing for the DOS-downloadable version
is $650.

    The DECrouter 150 supports two serial ports as well as an IEEE
802.3/Ethernet port. The serial lines can either be one at 56 or 64 Kbps
and one at 9.6 Kbps, or two lines at 19.2 Kbps. The product also supports
modem dial-back as a security feature.

    The router is available immediately and is priced at $3,250.

    For more information, Digital can be reached at 508-493-5111.

New Sniffer Net Monitor Debuts

    Billerica, Mass.-Network General is offering a new version of its
Sniffer network-monitoring product that does what the Sniffer's never done
before-stay in one place.

    The Sniffer was, until recently, a network-monitoring product designed
to be taken from place to place on the network, with a tap to cut in on
network wiring and interpretive software that runs on a laptop computer to
dissect the network traffic moving over the wire.

    Now, Network General is offering the Distributed Sniffer, which offers
similar functionality in a unit the size of a PC CPU, designed to be
scattered in groups over network segments and feed data to software that
analyzes and displays it on a PC-the SniffMaster Console, said Network
General.

    ``The basic product, the analyzer, allows you to see into your
network-it's like a CAT scan for your LAN,'' said company spokesman Ron
Herman.

    The Sniffer approach to monitoring the network is different from one
that has become more popular over the past two years, since the emergence
of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) element of TCP/IP.

    In the SNMP school, network devices are polled for their status by
management software-a process with the picturesque name of pinging-and the
devices send signals back to the manager.

    Sniffers actually tap into the network traffic, sampling it and
determining the state of the network that way.

    ``I don't necessarily think it's a conflict with SNMP,'' said Bob
Bessin, manager of market development for Network General. ``SNMP was
developed to check the status of the devices on the network. SNMP is
limiting. What we do is decode traffic on the network, provide statistics
on network traffic itself.''

    But he added that Sniffers can report to SNMP software.

    The system consists of Sniffer Servers, which actually tap into the
network and collect data. Applications running on the servers are the
Analysis Application, providing troubleshooting, performance analysis and
network optimization by capturing and analyzing packets on more than 120
protocols. The Monitoring Application tracks network traffic, keeping
network and station statistics, issuing alarms and trying to proactively
identify problems. It generates standard or customized reports.

    The Distributed Sniffer will be available in June. Server pricing is
$4,995 to $10,995, depending on applications and configuration. The
console, which consists of a board and software, is priced at $7,995. Two
starter kits are available: a kit of two Ethernet servers with monitoring
and analysis applications and a console board and software for $19,995,
and a 16/4-Mbps Token Ring starter kit for $21,995.


    Network General can be reached at 415-688-2700.

High-Speed LU6.2 Link Intro'd

    Lebanon, N.H.-Corporate Microsystems is introducing software to
provide for LU6.2 file transfer and remote execution across Unix, IBM
proprietary and OS/2 platforms.

    MLINK APPC Communications System (MACS) is ``an outgrowth of a need
among our customers to instigate a high-speed link along OSI,'' said Dick
Green, president of CMI.

    For executing jobs in the IBM environment, LU6.2 is much faster than
the more common form of IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
connectivity, where the client machine emulates an IBM 3270 terminal,
Green said.

    Meanwhile, for job execution on Unix, CMI intentionally stayed away
from the most common networking protocol, TCP/IP. Instead, CMI decided to
have the remote, non-Unix node on the network initiate Unix commands by
spawning a Bourne or C shell and generating commands either in ASCII or
the IBM equivalent to ASCII, EBCDIC. The shell is spawned using Virtual
Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM), a component of SNA.

    ``The reason for not using TCP/IP is that it's not a default in most
mainframe shops,'' Green said. ``VTAM is an integral part of the operating
system in 90 percent of the mainframe shops. TCP/IP will be found more
often in the future, and we will eventually support that.''

    MACS is now available for IBM mainframes running MVS or DOS/VSE. It
requires VTAM Release 3.2 or higher. The product is also now available for
the RS/6000 and the RT running AIX, and for systems running OS/2. It is
expected to be available for the AS/400 by June 1, and also for several
Unix platforms, including the NCR 3000, Bull DPX/2 and AT&T's Intel-based
platforms. It may be used over any SNA-supported link, including Token
Ring, SDLC, X.25 and Ethernet.

    Green said that CMI focused on file transfer and remote execution in a
strategy designed to achieve maximum performance for those two functions.
MACS intentionally offers far less functionality than a product like XCom,
from Spectrum Concepts in New York, which offers a full Unix-to-SNA API.

    CMI does not offer direct DOS or Macintosh connectivity, but signals
can be passed to the Mac or PC through the Unix machine, Green said.

    The mainframe pricing for the product is $11,500 to $29,500. The
RS/6000 version is priced from $2,495 to $6,500. MACS for OS/2 is priced
at $1,250.

    CMI can be reached at 617-259-1400.

NASA's TAE Eases Interface Design

By  DENIS HART



    Greenbelt, Md.-The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
technology distribution arm will soon make available to commercial users
its latest release of a software application environment called TAE Plus.

    TAE Plus Version 5.0, based on the OSF/Motif toolkit and X11R4, allows
users to interactively design end-user interfaces.

    TAE Plus, first developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center with
support from Century Computing and RMS Technologies, generates C or Ada
code automatically after a user interface is designed. The code connects
the user interface with lower-level computer services such as databases,
said Elfrida Harris, manager of TAE support at NASA.

    The main components of TAE include a WorkBench, a set of Window
Programming Tools and the TAE Command Language. The WorkBench allows users
to construct and manipulate a set of ``interaction objects.'' These
include user-entry objects, such as radio buttons and text entry fields;
information objects, such as brief status error messages displayed in a
bother box; and data-driven boxes such as dials, thermometers and strip
charts.

    The system's Window Programming Tools are services used by application
programs to display and control the WorkBench-designed user interface
objects. Unlike other commercial products, the WPTs allow users to create
a user interface that remains independent of the application code,
allowing changes  to be made to the interface without changing application
code, Harris said.

    ``I think most graphics tools use code to build the interface, and
that code becomes part of your application,'' she said. TAE's set of
windowing tools have also been submitted to the POSIX 1201.1 committee for
consideration in an upcoming layered application programming interface
standard.

    Pat Mortenson, director of marketing at Cosmic, NASA's commercial
distribution contractor, estimated that the latest version of the software
should be ready within two to four weeks. The new software, unlike the
previous 4.1 version, will run on Motif 1.1 and X11R4.

    The product has already been ported to the DECstation 3100 and DEC
VAXstations running Ultrix, Sun SPARCstations and the HP 9000 Series 3000
running Unix. It will also be ported to Macintosh II and Apollo
workstations as soon as they upgrade to Motif 1.1, Harris said.

   Users who want to do a complete installation from source code must have
X11R4, Motif 1.1 and a C and a C++ compiler, NASA said. The software
includes InterViews and idraw, two software packages developed by Stanford
University and integrated into the product.

    So far, Version 4.1 of the software has been installed in more than
400 user sites, a third of which are commercial users and the rest
academic institutions and government sites, Harris said. She added that,
unlike other graphical user interfaces, the software is geared more toward
non-programmers and has, therefore, proven popular.

    Mortenson agreed. She added that compared to existing commercial
products, TAE is also inexpensive. Although prices for the new product
haven't yet been decided on, licenses for Version 4.1 of the programming
system cost only $500. ``A person who develops a commercial product on TAE
is also free to distribute that product without restriction,'' Mortenson
said. She added that academic institutions are also eligible for a 50
percent discount.

    ``Since the products have been created with taxpayer money, NASA is
not expected to recover development costs,'' Mortenson said.

    Harris added, however, that the commercial acceptance of the new
product will be directly related to how widespread the use of Motif 1.1
becomes in the future.

    Most customers of TAE have been those who have been computer-literate,
such as universities, high-technology companies and some consulting firms.
So far, however, even though X-Window systems and Unix have prospered in
the financial community, few such firms and companies have sought out NASA
technology for their systems. Cosmic is at 404-542-3265.

OSF Patches Motif 1.0

    Cambridge, Mass.-The Open Software Foundation has made available a
patch release to Motif Version 1.0 for those users who have not yet
migrated to X11R4.

    The product, patch release 1.0.5, contains changes necessary to fix
approximately 40 bugs, but offers no new functionality, said OSF systems
engineer David Brooks.

    The corrections include changes to the X11R3 intrinsics that will
prevent the major memory leaks that occur when users delete dialog widgets
and corrections that previously caused compiling difficulties on various
architectures, Brooks said.

    The patch also corrects a warning message caused from setting scroll
bar thickness at more than two pixels and display errors caused when users
use horizontal scrolling with tabbed characters in text. The patch also
reworks some code that caused an incorrect x-pointer icon size on
DECstations running Ultrix.

     Brooks said this will be the last patch released for Motif 1.0 and
added that though there may be some outstanding problems, ``none of them
are fatal.''

   Although OSF will still accept questions on usage and code problems for
its previous Motif release, OSF will not fix code problems for Motif 1.0
from now on.

    Brooks also said that all the fixes made to Motif 1.0 have already
been made to Motif 1.1.

    Motif 1.0.5 is available at no charge to Motif 1.0 licensees who hold
full support or update contracts for Motif. Also, those users who have
already received 1.0.4 will receive the new patch automatically.

   Contact the Motif Support Administration, Open Software Foundation,
617-621-7300, or via E-mail at motif-support-admin@osf.org.

DATA MANAGEMENT

    By Julie Anderson



    At the recent UNIX Today!DCI Open Systems Forum in Atlanta, we spent

half of the first day tossing about various definitions for the term
``open system.'' After hearing several speakers' thoughts on the subject,
we generally agreed that for a system to be ``open,'' it must provide a
defined set of standard interfaces.


     The obvious advantage of open systems to end users is vendor
independence. Vendors may not consider this an advantage as they watch
their margins dwindle, but end users become free to base their
applications on a mix of products from many vendors.


     Unfortunately, we are just starting to see the first open systems. So
far, much interface-definition work has focused on standardizing low-level
operating system interfaces--system and library calls. This is fine if
you're using C.

    But what about the sizable number of people who are building DBMS
applications? True, many are writing C code and using SQL for data
definition and manipulation. These people are faring relatively well
because of the ANSI efforts to standardize SQL (a slow and painful
process). Useful standards are also promised from the SQL Access Group.

     Many people, however, are using the DBMS vendor's 4GL or front-end
tools to build at least part, if not all, of the application. Yet, there
are no standard interfaces for the end user for these tools, nor am I
aware of any standards movements afoot. Any similarities that you may find
among the many 4GLs on the market are merely coincidental. Oracle, for
example, doesn't even have a 4GL; it has an interactive forms builder,
SQLoForms, that generates a screen definition which is driven by the
Oracle runforms utility.

     A few products do provide vendor independence at the database level.
Unify and Jyacc offer tools (Accell and Jam) that build data entry forms
that can be used with a variety of databases. But a Jam screen is not
interchangeable with an Accell form, and vice versa.

     At one of the Forum sessions, the MIS directors from Hyatt Hotels and
the Burlington Coat Factory presented their strategies and experiences
with building OLTP applications on Unix. Both had chosen Informix as their
database and used Informix/4GL as their development language. They were
impressed by the high productivity that Informix/4GL gave them. In
addition, they were able to hire less technical (i.e., cheaper) people to
do the development. (Not good news for CICS experts, I must say.)

     By choosing Informix, Hyatt and Burlington Coat Factory were able to
get vendor independence. Because Informix runs on a wide variety of
systems, the underlying hardware and operating system could be changed
without having to modify the application.

     But as an astute attendee pointed out, these systems are only
quasi-open. They are vendor-independent at the hardware and
operating-system levels, but tied tightly to the Informix vendor at the
API level. Changing to a different DBMS means a rewrite of the
application.

     What are application developers to do to get high productivity and an
open system too? Unite. Vendors have little incentive to standardize their
APIs unless users insist. To survive, vendors must deliver what the
customer demands.

Motif GUIs For Ada

By DAN RICHMAN



    San Diego-Ada programmers working on Data General's AViiON, SPARC and
Sun-3 systems can automatically create Motif-based graphical user
interfaces by using new techniques with products already sold by Telesoft,
according to Bruce Sherman, the company's vice president of corporate
marketing.

    Telesoft has released an 18-page ``technical application note''
describing how to use two of its interface-generation products, TeleGen2
Ada and TeleUSE, with Ada. Until now, those products could be used only
with C.

    TeleUSE lets programmers ``paint'' static screens and describe with
if-then statements how the interface should function. Then they
automatically generate Ada (or C) code to produce those results. TeleGen2
Ada includes a compiler, a debugger, an optimizer, a profiler and
productivity tools. The two products can be used separately for other
purposes, but must be used together to generate Motif-based GUI interfaces
for Ada.

    Automatic interface-generators can save up to 90 percent of the time
that writing such code from scratch would consume, Sherman said.

    The technical application note is free with the licensing of the two
products, or on request to current users. TeleUSE is priced at costs
$7,500; TeleGen2 Ada costs from $4,500 to $9,500 depending on the
platform. Telesoft can be contacted at 619-457-2700.

Ada Bindings For V.I. Tools from richman

    Northampton, Mass.-V.I. Corp. has announced bindings that are said to
make it easier for Ada developers to use its DataViews application
development tools. The bindings (C language header files that allow one
language to be called from another) sell for $3,000 and are available
immediately.

    DataViews is a package of tools for creating dynamic GUIs. Dynamic
GUIs can display not only icons that launch programs but symbols that
change to represent data. For example, in a direct manipulation interface
typical of those produced by DataViews, opening a GUI ``valve'' can
instruct the program to drain the tank, and the liquid level in the GUI
``tank'' will steadily decrease as it drains, said Andrew Copeland, V.I.'s
vice president of marketing and operations.

    The bindings must be used with DataViews' DV-Tools, which sells for
$17,700. That price includes DV-Draw, a drawing editor, but not DV-Proto,
a prototyping tool.

    The company can be reached at 413-586-4144.

Acer Intros i486-Based Machines -- Touts Workstations And Servers'
Performance, Expandability, Graphics Processing

    San Jose-Acer America recently rolled out two new workstations and two
servers, all powered by Intel's new i486 SX processor.

    Units, priced in monitorless base configurations from $2,745 to
$11,995, can run either SCO or Interactive Unix or MS-DOS. The two Unix
operating systems can be purchased separately at a cost of about $700 for
SCO Unix and $600 for Interactive. The systems also will run Banyan Vines
and Novell NetWare.

     Desktop units are called the AcerPower 486SX and the AcerPower 500.
Floor-standing servers are the AcerFrame 1000 and the AcerFrame 3000SP33.

    Acer director of product marketing Olend King said the machines are
distinguished from other PCs by their performance, expandability and
graphics processing. Both workstations support Ultra-VGA graphics.

    All units use a 20-MHz, 14-MIPS 486SX processor except for the
3000SP33, which uses a 33-MHz, 20-MIPS 486SX. Upgrades to a 33- and
eventually a 50-MHz 486SX can be made by inserting a new chip into the
motherboard through Acer's ChipUp upgrade technology or through modular
upgrades.

    Acer said it has designed the 486SX for use in graphical windowing
environments. The system's $2,745 base configuration includes 2 Mbytes of
memory and can support as much as 98 Mbytes of RAM. The unit's memory
implementation supports as many as 63 different SIMM conbinations,
allowing incremental upgrades without RAM swapouts, Acer said.

    Available immediately, the workstation also features 8k bytes of
internal processor cache, Ultra-VGA graphics supporting 1,024-by-768-pixel
resolution, four ISA slots and a 1.44-Mbyte, 3.5-inch floppy disk drive.

    The Power500 is a six-slot EISA-based modular system for engineering,
financial and entry-level networking and multiuser Unix environments.

    Featuring 4 to 256 Mbytes of memory, the $3,745 base unit uses a
128-bit data path that supports dynamic expansion from 32-, 64- and
128-bit accesses as memory is expanded. The system also supports Ultra-VGA
graphics resolution.

    Acer's AcerFrame 1000 is an EISA-based, floor-standing server designed
for networked and multiuser Unix work groups. The unit holds 4 to 128
Mbytes of RAM and eight EISA expansion slots. A 5.25-floppy disk drive is
included. Availability is expected in June.

    The AcerFrame 1000, which supports at least 32 users, has a suggested
base price of $4,995 and will be available in June, Acer said.

    The AcerFrame 3000SP33, priced at approximately $11,995 and available
this month, was designed for client/server environments and applications
such as business databases. It supports eight to 64 users and supports
Novell NetWare, Banyan Vines and OS/2 LAN Manager.

    The unit features 8 to 64 Mbytes of RAM, a 5.25-inch floppy disk
drive, secondary-level processor cache, eight EISA expansion slots,
built-in VGA and an LCD console. An EISA SCSI disk controller is
available. The unit supports as much as 2 gigabytes of internal on-line
storage using SCSI hard disk drives.

    Monitors available from Acer include the AcerView 35, a
1,024-by-768-pixel color monitor priced at $995; the AcerView 33, an
800-by-600 color monitor costing $795; and a black-and-white monitor
priced at $200. The units are equipped with Windows 3.0 but will support
windowing environments from SCO and Interactive, King said.

    While the new systems continue Acer's reliance on Intel, Acer is
investigating whether to build a Mips-based RISC system in accordance with
the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) specification, said King.

    ``We're evaluating the marketplace as the year goes on,'' he said.

    Acer last month became part of a 22-member ACE initiative. The
companies plan to build or distribute systems that would run the SCO Open
Desktop and Microsoft OS/2 3.0 operating environments on systems based on
Intel and Mips R3000 and R4000 processors.

    Acer can be contacted at 408-922-0333.

Imaging Unit Unveiled

By  LEE BRUNO



    Dayton, Ohio-NCR has unveiled a general-purpose imaging system aimed
at making image-based document processing affordable to users who want to
combine such image-processing tasks as scanning, optical storage,
character recognition and relational database services into a single
system.

    The client/server-based product, called the Document Management System
(DMS), runs on NCR's System 3000 line of Unix-based servers and
workstations over either a Token Ring or Ethernet connection and supports
SNA 3270 communications protocols. Included with the system is an optical
disk jukebox that provides the large storage capacity required for image
records.

    One of the key components in the DMS product is called Workflow
Automation. This software element is icon-driven and allows the user to
see where a particular document is at any time. This capability allows an
organization to graphically represent and track the flow of documents
being processed within an office or an enterprisewide networked
environment.

    Another component of the system is its character-recognition
capability. This technology utilizes neural network principles, which
allows the system to adapt and learn the important inputs in a particular
environment. NCR said this technology involves three algorithms, of which
one is a neural network-based algorithm. NCR said the technology enables
the system to read typewritten fonts as well as hand-printed numbers.


    The size of typical image records that the DMS can handle is roughly
50k bytes, while conventional application data records only run from 100
to 1,000 bytes, NCR said. To handle these larger files, NCR said it added
Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) in both central processing unit and
memory and in their I/O subsystems.

    NCR said the product will be featured with the System 3000 line of
workstations. The system ranges in price from $800,000 for a
20-workstation configuration to $3.5 million for a 120-workstation system.

    NCR said the DMS will be delivered in the first quarter of 1991. For
additional information, call 513-445-5000.

Graphics Performance Gets A Boost

    Austin, Texas-National Design has rolled out three new Unix-based
graphics coprocessor boards based on Texas Instruments' TMS34020 chip for
PCs that boost graphics performance and allow a user to modify the board
characteristics to meet high-resolution requirements.

    The three boards plug into the AT bus of PCs or compatibles and are
called the AT1100, AT1300 and AT1600. They are designed to boost the
graphics performance of a PC, allowing a user to run graphics routines at
175,000 independent vectors per second in a Unix environment and 65,000
Xstones in an X-Window environment. The board runs under both SCO Open
Desktop 1.1 and Interactive Unix 2.2. National said the TI TMS34020
graphics processor is a particularly fast ``fill engine'' that allows a
user to draw and shade graphic images quickly.

    National said the products can be modified to meet user requirements,
such as higher resolution and color diversity for particular graphics
applications. For example, the AT1100 is capable of delivering 24-bit
color in 1,024-by-768 resolution with 16.7 million colors. If a user wants
a greater resolution, such as 1,280-by-1,024, then the AT1300 snap-in
module can be added to the AT1100 base board and get 16-bit color. Those
demanding a 1,600-by-1,280 resolution display would add the AT1600 module
to the base board and get 8-bit color with 256 colors.

    Gabrielle Ryan, president of National Design, said the boards are
targeted at the process-control market in manufacturing and the electronic
engineering market. Typically, these two markets utilize PCs along with
Unix-based servers, and the boards allow PCs running Unix to interoperate
with VME-based Unix systems, Ryan said. For example, a person using a
PC-based Unix workstation can design a part and then send that data file
to the VME-based shop floor for production, Ryan added.

    Ryan said that all of the server component-utilized in an X-Window
environment-fits on the graphics coprocessor board, and only a few
low-level CPU routines are executed on the main CPU of the host. In
addition, the base board also contains all of the DRAM and video RAM.

    National said it also provides a 3-D snap-in module for the boards
that utilizes TI's TMS34082 floating-point coprocessor chip. This option
allows the user to execute up to 40 million floating-point operations per
second, Ryan said.

    National said the three boards will ship this June. The AT1100 costs
$2,995, while the AT1300 and AT1600 costs $3,995.

    For additional information, call 512-343-5055.

Integrated SPARC Chipset Bows

    Sunnyvale-Weitek today plans to announce an integrated SPARC chipset
that could enable SPARC-compatible makers to build SPARCstation 2-class
systems selling for $10,000 by summer.

    Weitek's SPARC Enhancement set includes the W8701 SPARC
microprocessor, which integrates the floating-point and integer units onto
a single chip, and the W8720 Integrated Graphics Controller (IGC), a
single-chip graphics acceleration unit. The W8720 is a single-slot Sbus
card that allows for migration of accelerated 2-D graphics to the
motherboard of next-generation SPARC workstations, Weitek said.

    ``What we're doing is providing the systems manufacturers an
opportunity to come up on the power curve,'' said Christopher Tice,
general manager of Weitek's processor business group.

    By combining the floating-point and integer units on one chip, the
W8701 cuts system processor cost, Weitek said. The 207-pin unit delivers
28.5 MIPS and 21 SPECmarks when used at 40 MHz and roughly 23.5 MIPS and
17 SPECmarks at 33 MHz, Tice said.

    The 40-MHz ratings compare with Sun's SPARCstation 2, which has a base
price of $15,000. Through the SPARC Enhancement set, SPARC-compatible, or
clone, builders could build 28.5-MIPS systems in the $10,000 range
depending on their own design expertise, said Tice. The chipset is
expected to be available in May and begin appearing in systems this
summer.

    Tice said several SPARC-compatible makers are interested in the
chipset, but he would not name them. Weitek, which has provided
floating-point units for existing SPARC chipsets, said the W8701 is a
single-unit replacement for Cypress Semiconductor's multichip 601/CY7C602
SPARC RISC chipset.

    ``This is one of the first, if not the first, design for a SPARC
microprocessor that was done outside of Sun,'' Tice said.

    Weitek is pricing the chip in quantities of 5,000 at $240 for the
33-MHz device and $264 for the 40-MHz version.

    The 208-pin W8720 features internal memory and video control
functionality and hardwires such graphics functions as polygon drawing,
BitBLT( BitBlock Line Transfer) and logical raster operations. It is rated
at 400,000 2-D vectors per second and 100 million pixels per second. The
unit runs in the frame-buffer bandwidth, Tice said.

    The chip can be used in windowed graphics environments such as
X-Window, Microsoft Windows, SunView or Display PostScript, Weitek said.

    The chipset marks Weitek's entry into the SPARC microprocessor market,
although the company has been supplying floating-point units for SPARC
chips.

    Weitek can be reached in Sunnyvale at 408-738-8400.

OLTP Box From NEC

By DAN RICHMAN



    Tokyo-Targeting the telecommunications industry, NEC said it plans to
start shipping its first fault-tolerant on-line transaction processing
computer, the Super Tolerant FT20, in late November.

    The machine's manufacturer, Stratus Computer, calls it the first
commercially available RISC-based fault-tolerant computer to run SVR4.
Stratus, which announced the machine last month, sells it as the XA/R
Model 20.

    The machine runs at 40 MIPS with 32-MHz i860 RISC chips. NEC will sell
it for 78 million yen (about $591,000 at current exchange rates) equipped
with 32 Mbytes of memory in each of its two processors, duplexed I/O and
other essentials, a tape drive, and LAN and OS software. Stratus sells it
for $274,000 with essentially the same configuration.

    NEC spokesman Yoshiko Senft (CQ) said the price difference results in
part from features NEC adds, like Japanese-language processing and
printing and enhanced connectivity with NEC's other computers and
software.

    NEC will market the Super Tolerant FT20 both alone and in conjunction
with its NEAX 61 central office switching equipment. Targeted customers
include national and regional phone companies, providers of 800- and
900-number services, credit-card verification services, and private phone
networks.

    Both NEC and Stratus stressed that fault tolerance is becoming
increasingly important in telecommunications as more and more data travel
over phone lines. Stratus regards telecommunications as ``a key
opportunity for growth,'' said Dave Hayward, a Stratus spokesman.

    For more information, NEC can be reached at 508-264-8000.

CROSSINGS

Perhaps the most well-known Unix transaction processing (TP)
monitor is Tuxedo, from AT&T's spinoff, Unix System Laboratories (USL).
That may be because Tuxedo is probably the oldest Unix TP monitor around;
it has been used inside AT&T Bell Laboratories and other AT&T units since
1982, and its roots go back to even earlier development projects. Tuxedo
has been available for license since 1985.

    Tuxedo supports a distributed on-line transaction processing (OLTP)
environment, supporting client/server networks. In keeping with the
``open'' philosophy, Tuxedo remains independent of any particular RDBMS,
network protocol, hardware platform or Unix version.

    Mark Curges, one of Tuxedo's principal architects and a member of
USL's technical team, refers to Tuxedo as ``the glue'' that can hold
together a heterogeneous network of different versions of Unix running on
different hardware platforms-a 386, a Mips RISC CPU, you name it.

    The Tuxedo System consists of two major components, System /T and
System /D. The first, /T, is a transaction-processing (TP) monitor. It is
the real glue that binds multiple systems, including desktop computers,
workstations and servers, together across a network.

    The System /T TP monitor oversees and controls transactions across the
network. It consists of libraries for making systems calls to the Unix
operating system and relational and hierarchical databases, as well as
commands.T is database-independent and includes interfaces to all leading
Unix relational database management systems (RDBMSes), including Oracle,
Informix, Ingres, Sybase and others. It conforms to X/Open's XA TP
interface.

    The second component is System /D, a combined hierarchical and
relational DBMS. It was also developed and used internally for TP
applications within AT&T and the old Bell System. System /T and /D are
licensed separately, with more licensees opting for /T than /D. That makes
sense, as many of the licensees are leading Unix RDBMS vendors, who
obviously do not need T&T&APOTROPH;s DBMS

    Tuedo, which USL licenses to any interested party, runs on Unix System
V Release 4 operating system, supporting OLTP applications in a
client/&TC;server environment. Network protocol support includes TCP/IP,
the current standard in the Unix market, as well as the Open Systems
Interconnect (OSI) suite, IBM's NetBIOS and Novell's NetWare.

    Curges notes that though open OLTP systems offer many advantages over
traditional proprietary ones, customers simply will not throw away their
existing investments, especially in applications that for many companies
deliver revenue-generating services to customers. For that reason,
interfacing open OLTP systems to existing proprietary OLTP systems is a
hot item, he says. In response, USL is developing a third component,
called /Host, that will connect the /T TP monitor to an IBM Customer
Information Control System (CICS) TP environment through IBM SNA 3270 and
LU 6.2 protocols. This product was demonstrated in the USL booth at the
UniForum show last January in Dallas.

Interactive Readies Its System V.4 OS

By  DENIS HART



    Santa Monica, Calif.-Interactive has set June 2, the date of a
developers' conference for its Unix System V product line, for the
introduction of its Unix System V.4 operating system and development
environment.

    Interactive CEO Dennis Peck said that the product will be based on
Unix System Laboratories' base V.4 version, but said that Interactive will
also supply Motif with the product.

    Interactive expects, however, to begin shipping enhancements to the
product sometime in the last quarter of this year. ``This will be our
initial product. We will have a second release in the fourth quarter of
this year, and we are planning a major release in the first half of
1992,'' Peck said.

    The product, which will operate on 386 and 486 systems, will be
targeted toward ISVs, sophisticated end users and the value-added reseller
community, he added.

     Paul Wellens, product line manager for V.4 at Interactive, said that
the product will be the first V.4 on the market to follow USL's published
model and, unlike the competition, Interactive will not modify the base
product.

    He added that unlike such products as Microport's and UHC's V.4
implementations, Interactive's release will be based on V.4 Version 3, the
latest of USL's source code releases. Version 3 offers reliability
enhancements and a new installation program that make it easier for V.4 to
be installed on Intel-based systems. The base system will include the Open
Look GUI, X11R4 and full documentation, Peck said.

    Interactive also expects to add additional enhancements to the product
by the end of 1991. Most notably, ``what you can expect to see in our
fourth quarter release is iBCS2 compatibility, our version of Portable
NetWare for V.4 and a V.4-oriented DOS simulator,'' Peck said. IBSC2
compatibility will allow applications to be portable over SCO Unix and
Interactive Unix environments.

    The next release of Interactive V.4 should also include USL's
multiprocessing extensions, Interactive said.

    Peck said he expects more than 500 people to attend the developers'
conference. The conference will feature 84 speakers, 50 technical sessions
and product demonstrations by approximately 30 vendors. Kodak will also be
showcasing a photo finisher workstation running V.4.

Upgraded HP/UX Debuts

    Palo Alto-Hewlett-Packard has brought out a new release of the HP/UX
operating system, tailored specifically for its new low-end HP Apollo 9000
Series 7000 workstations, but also compatible with the Series 300 and 400
workstations and Series 800 business servers.

    The new HP/UX 8.0 includes enhancements such as Instant Ignition, a
pre-loaded and preconfigured system that includes the X-Window System,
OSF/Motif, HP Visual User Environment 2.01, and System Administration
Manager, a menu-driven system-administration utility.

    ``What Instant Ignition basically is, is all the most popular things a
customer would buy preinstalled on a disk such that the customer plugs the
system in and up it comes. It includes the operating system, X-Windows and
Motif,'' said Chris Van Woerken, HP/UX product manager. ``Literally, it's
a matter of plugging in your machine and hitting the power switch,'' he
said.

    The operating system conforms to SVID2, XPG3, POSIX 1003.1, FIPS 151-1
and Network Computing System and NFS communication protocols.

    Although Van Woerken claims the system is based on V.3, HP/UX 8.0 does
not have Streams, the networking protocol included in AT&T's Unix System
V.3. ``We are starting to get some input for Streams and are starting to
consider it in our future plans,'' he said. He added that although the
current product has a full set of ``Berkeley-isms, there aren't as many as
all of our customers would like. We are remedying that on an ongoing
basis.'' He said that Berkeley MAP libraries are something that HP will
add in future releases of the product.

    HP will also make the full set of OSI protocols available to users as
a separate package, and will make the full set of operating system
documentation for the new operating system available on a CD-ROM format
for $695.

    In line with the company's hopes of making its systems easier to use
for the end user, Hewlett-Packard's new System Administration Manager also
helps system administrators with such tasks as adding users, configuring
the system with diskless clusters and setting up different system backup
mechanisms.

    ``We spent a lot of time to make life easier for the user and have
added all the latest standards that exist in this point in time,'' Van
Woerken said.

    HP also plans to run native OSF/1 on the system 7000 line by the end
of the year and plans to make OSF/1 and HP/UX 8.0 application-compatible
in that time frame.

    The new product also has additional tools, including HP Switch
Over/UX, a feature that switches jobs to a standby processor when there is
a system failure, and a version of the Korn shell that allows users to
navigate HP/UX systems interactively.

    Hewlett-Packard is at 303-229-2255.

Tracking Adverse Drug Reactions

By  LEE BRUNO



    Stamford, Conn.-Clinical Information Services has unveiled a
Unix-based information system for pharmaceutical companies that can manage
data about adverse reactions to drugs and produce reports required by
health authorities.

    The product, called the Adverse-Reaction Information System (ARIS),
runs on Apollo and Sun workstations and provides users with a tool for
validating and analyzing data about adverse drug reactions. The data
collected can then be used to produce reports in different languages for
worldwide health authorities such as the World Health Organization and
regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, CIS
officials said.

    CIS said pharmaceutical companies are required to submit data on
adverse reactions to drugs to governmental regulatory bodies that oversee
drug safety. Typically, the company said, these reports have to be
submitted within a few days of any new reports of an adverse reaction.

    CIS said some of the types of reports ARIS can produce include forms
that can be submitted to regulatory bodies such as France's Commission
Nationale De Pharmacovigilance, the Italian Ministry of Health and
England's Committee on the Safety of Medicines.

        CIS said the system is capable of providing the necessary
information for a Drug Experience Report, used for recording drugs' side
effects and adverse reactions. The product is able to extract the
necessary data from the report and import it into a letter for regulatory
agencies.

    One of the key advantages of the system is that a small or large
pharmaceutical company can use the product to track all adverse drug
reactions worldwide, CIS said.

    Arthur Allen, sales manager at CIS, said ARIS can also be used as a
tool for archiving information about drugs and adverse reactions. The ARIS
system operates in a distributed environment so that drug information from
both clinical studies and post-marketing studies can be pooled for
evaluation, CIS officials said.

    The ARIS system supports data entry with defined code lists that
pinpoint the country where an adverse reaction was reported. In addition,
a user can access various types of data groups, such as patient and
disease data, through a menu option window. Also, the system has a set of
standard dictionaries in multiple languages for diseases, drugs and
adverse reactions. These dictionaries and languages can be selected during
data entry and report generation.

    The system is able to link multiple processors and printers at remote
sites over communication networks including Ethernet, wide-area networks
and leased lines, CIS officials said. The system is based on Oracle's
database and allows a user to customize the data structure and screen
formats.

    The ARIS system runs on Unix-based Apollo and Sun workstations and is
written in the C programming language. A basic configuration of the system
running on a Sun workstation costs $68,000 and includes phone support and
training. The basic license allows the user to run as many terminals off
the main workstation as desired. However, each additional remote node
connected to the main workstation by a communication link costs $16,000.

    For more information, call CIS at 203-964-8317.

3-D Tool Blends Voxels, Geometry

By LEE BRUNO



    Fairfield, Iowa-Vital Images has unveiled a Unix-based interactive
volume-rendering software system that allows engineers and scientists to
embed traditional geometricgraphics such as lines into a volume of 3-D
data.


    The company said the new product, called VoxelView/Ultra, increases
the rendering speed and efficiency and allows a user to comine both
voxels-a three-dimensional pixel&HYPHand geometry into one image. In the
past, a user would have to choose between these two visualization methods.

    The product runs on Silicon Graphics' IRIS Powervision family of
workstations.

    Vital Images said it developed the product because its customers have
been asking for a way of melding geometric graphics and volume rendering
without giving up the inherent benefits of each method. For example, an
engineer evaluating oil and gas fields can combine seismic data and data
gathered from the well into the same image to help determine where the
likely regions of oil deposits may reside.

    Bill Van Zandt, director of research and development at Vital Images,
said VoxelView/Ultra will provide both scientists and engineers with a new
tool for visualizing data.

    ``It will be a way of summarizing data and helping to quantify further
by enabling scientists and engineers to make concrete measurements,'' Van
Zandt said, referring to the VoxelView/Ultra product. ``Now, in a few
seconds they can see an entire rendered volume that they could have taken
months to look at in 2-D slides and paper,'' he said.

    Vital Images said the previous version of VoxelView Plus rendered 4
million voxels per second on a four-CPU SGI GTX workstation. The new
product, running on a single CPU IRIS/4D-310 VGX workstation, can
volume-render data at a rate of 18 million voxels per second. The product
is also capable of volume-rendering photo-realistic images with shading,
variable transparency and anti-aliasing at about 10 million voxels per
second.

    One of the areas in which the company said it expects the product to
be used is in planning radiation treatment, in which a doctor can use the
volume data to help target the radiation beams at tumors. Doctors may also
use the system for checking that a bone implant will fit the body socket
it was designed for.

    Simultaneously, the company also debuted its development environment
software, called VoxelView 2.0, which the VoxelView/Ultra product runs
under. A component of the VoxelView product is a rendering ``engine'' that
takes voxel volume and rendering parameters and produces an image of
volume rendered.

    Vital Images said the VoxelView/Ultra product costs $40,000 for a
version that runs on SGI's IRIS/4D VGX Powervision computer. A version of
the VoxelView/E for SGI's Personal IRIS workstations costs $20,000, while
a Voxel/View/Plus 2.0 for SGI's IRIS/4D GT and GTX workstations costs
$30,000.  All of the products will ship this June.

Four RDBMS Gateways Bow

    Burlington, Mass.-SQL Solutions has introduced four models of its
Gateway, a product that lets users access and manipulate data stored in
Oracle, Rdb, Ingres and Informix relational database management systems as
if the data were stored in a Sybase SQL Server environment.

    The Gateway can help users migrate from those RDBMSes to Sybase while
preserving their data investments, said Dan Cronin, SQL Solutions' vice
president of marketing. The Gateway also allows any third-party front-end
tool to be used on any of those four back-end databases, by means of the
Sybase SQL Client, an application programming interface (API).

    A separate Gateway is required to access each of the four RDBMSes for
which the product is available. With multiple gateways, several RDBMSes
can be accessed concurrently.

    The Gateways for Unix platforms sll for between $5,000 and $14,000,
depending on the size of the machine, and are available for Ultrix and
SunOS. SQL Solutions can be reached at 617-270-4150.

Spotlight On Serial X Terminals -- GraphOn, NCD Machines Offer Special
Protocols, Neatly Fill The X Serial Void

By  JASON LEVITT



    Back in the '70s, when American Motors and disco ruled the Earth and
the acronym GUI was never heard, companies invested millions in ASCII
terminal technology because it was cheap, standard and vendor-independent.
Today, many of the same companies are contemplating replacement of those
ASCII terminals with X terminals. X technology is also cheap, standard and
vendor-independent, and has the added attraction of an advanced

    GUI and considerable flexibility. Most companies that  are switching
will replace their RS232 serial connections with Ethernet, but RS232 will
still make sense in some situations such as modem connections and in
locations where it is too expensive or logistically difficult to lay
Ethernet.

     In these cases, why not run X over existing serial lines? This is a
good idea, and nearly every X-terminal and workstation vendor supports
SL/IP (Serial Line Internet Protocol), the de facto standard for such
serial connections. However, SL/IP has a number of deficiencies, such as
lack of data compression and robust error detection, that make it less
than adequate for X-

    Window use. Point to Point Protocol (PPP) is a better solution, but it
will be a while before implementations are widely available.


     Filling the X serial void are two companies, GraphOn and NCD, who
have
developed their own serial protocols designed specifically for running X over

serial connections. NCD's protocol, XRemote, runs only on NCD X terminals
equipped with special XRemote PROMs. GraphOn has no special name for its
protocol, which is built in to the GraphOn X terminal firmware. (We will
just call it the GraphOn protocol.)

     The primary customers for these protocols are individuals and
companies involved in remote computing over phone lines using modems, and,
to a lesser extent, those interested in running X over inexpensive and
convenient direct RS232 serial connections.


X BY DESIGN

     As Fig. 1 shows, GraphOn and NCD tackle the serial problem in
different ways with different degrees of success.

     The GraphOn approach splits the X server between host and X terminal.
The device-independent (dix) portion of the X server, which handles the
bulk of X-Window server functionality, runs on the host, where it can take
advantage of virtual memory, higher I/O throughput and raw CPU power. The
device-dependent layer (ddx), the part that vendors must port to their
monitor, CPU, mouse and keyboard specifications, is split between the X
terminal and the host.

     With the bulk of the server on the host, GraphOn can be very
intelligent about what it sends down the wire to the X terminal. Many
screen events that would normally generate a flurry of packet activity
between a typical X terminal and host generate little or no activity with
GraphOn. Error correction and compression ensures that any traffic
generated moves quickly and safely. GraphOn uses a sliding-window protocol
with 14-bit checksum and Lempel-Ziv compression. It can operate over 7-bit
and 8-bit data paths.

     Because the GraphOn can use host resources to store pixmaps, fonts
and other server data, very little RAM is required inside the X terminal;
consequently, the GraphOn 19 comes with 1 Mbyte of RAM standard. There are
no upgrades available; according to GraphOn, none are needed. Having a
host-resident server means that the X application can use the host's
virtual memory instead of being limited to the amount of physical RAM in
the X terminal as is NCD.

     NCD takes a rather conventional approach to the problem by basically
replacing the TCP/IP protocol normally used to transport X protocol
packets with their own custom protocol stack, called XRemote. XRemote uses
a sliding-window protocol with 16-bit CRC error correction and a
proprietary compression technique to transfer X protocol packets over the
serial line to and from the X server. Unlike GraphOn, XRemote cannot use a
7-bit data path. This will be a disadvantage if your serial lines support
only 7 bits, which is sometimes true of older installations.

     Unlike GraphOn, NCD makes no attempt to alter the basic logic of the
MIT X server; X clients communicate with the XRemote daemon running on the
host, which exchanges X protocol packets with the X server running on the
terminal. The lower layer of the XRemote protocol is similar to the
emerging PPP standard, which indicates that NCD may ultimately support
PPP. PPP is a serial protocol that is expected to replace SL/IP.

     A SL/IP connection, which has no compression and poor error
correction, is illustrated in the first part of Fig. 1. (For more details
about SL/IP and PPP, see ``Two Protocols Worth Observing,'' in the Jan. 7,
1991, issue of UNIX Today!)

     In order to get a ``feel'' for the relative speed of XRemote and
SL/IP, Table 1 displays some comparative benchmark results. As you can
see, 9,600-bps SL/IP runs at about 1/10 to 1/20 the speed of Ethernet,
while direct 9,600 bps XRemote runs about 5 times faster than SL/IP. This
contradicts NCD's XRemote documentation which claims that it is 10 times
faster than SL/IP.


SETTING THINGS UP

         Thanks to thoughtful software engineering from both NCD and
GraphOn, setting up serial X connections is quite easy. In the UNIX Today!
lab, equipped with a SPARCstation 1 (SS1) host on loan from Apex

    Computers of Redmond, Wash., a GraphOn 21 X terminal and an NCD19 X
terminal, connections were established using both direct serial cables and
9696 V.32 modems from FastComm of Reston, Va.

     The first step is to load the appropriate software tape onto your
host system. NCD and GraphOn sell tapes for popular Unix systems. Both the
NCD and GraphOn tapes contain binaries, fonts, start-up files and tools
for use with the XRemote and GraphOn protocols. The latest beta NCD
version, which was not tested, includes a terminal-resident,
Motif-compatible window manager that should prove popular.

     Firing up the X terminals is simply a matter of switching them on,
because the protocols are supported entirely from internal firmware. If
you already own an NCD X terminal with the standard server PROMs, you will
have to replace them with the XRemote server PROMs. The NCD PROMs are
conveniently accessible through a small slot on the back of the CPU box.
Swapping them out takes 30 minutes or so.

     Establishing a connection between the X terminal and host is done via
a built-in terminal emulator that each terminal supports. If the
connection is direct, you immediately see a login prompt on your X
terminal. If you are using a modem, you use the usual Hayes commands to
dial the modem attached to the host. Once logged in, you simply type
xinitremote for XRemote or startxgo -pl 3 for GraphOn, and the X server
connection is automatically established.

    At a minimum, a single xterm client is launched. To exit the X server
connection and return to the terminal emulator screen, you exit all X
clients.


    The display name for both GraphOn and XRemote is testbed:1.0, where
testbed is the name of the SPARCstation host. When running the XRemote and
GraphOn protocols over serial lines, the X terminals logically exist as
extra displays attached to the host rather than separate nodes on the
network.

    If you are establishing a modem connection, it is important to use a
full-duplex modem. NCD recommends the FastComm modems, which support the
recent V.32 full-duplex standard. Half-duplex modems, like the Telebit
Trailblazer Plus using their PEP mode, are fine for file transfers where
most of the data traffic flows in one direction at a time, but interactive
sessions require that data flow in both directions simultaneously for best
results.

     The newer Telebit T2500 or T1600 provide V.32 in addition to PEP.
Most V.32 modems optionally provide hardware data compression and error
correction, but these must be disabled when using XRemote or GraphOn
because data compression and error correction are provided by the
protocols. Using these modem options actually slows throughput because
they provide no additional functionality, yet require compute time.


FLEXIBILITY AND PACKAGING

         Both the NCD and GraphOn X terminals have unusual cabinet designs
as X terminals go. The GraphOn 21 is an ``all-in-one'' unit with the usual
pizza box electronics stuffed inside the back of the monitor. This
actually makes it the most compact 21-inch monitor I've ever seen. The
NCD19 has a bracket for attaching the monitor to the base unit, thus
turning it into a single unit as well. Both machines have thick and thin
Ethernet ports and a serial port. The serial ports on the NCD and GraphOn
are configurable up to 38,400 and 57,600 bps, respectively. (For more
general software and hardware details, see ``X Terminals: The Ratings Are
In,'' in the April 1, 1991, issue of UNIX Today!)

     With the XRemote PROMs installed, the NCD19 can run the XRemote
protocol over the serial port or over Ethernet. If you want to use the NCD
with TCP/IP and X protocol over Ethernet, you can download the NCD X
server into it from the host, provided you purchase the regular
(non-XRemote) boot tape and load it on the host.

    The GraphOn runs GraphOn protocol over its serial port or Ethernet,
but GraphOn does not offer a version that sends X-Window protocol over the
wire.

     The ability to use the NCD as both a standard Ethernet-based X
terminal and XRemote serial X terminal is a big plus for those needing
connectivity in both environments.


PRICE

     Ask anyone why they purchased an X terminal, and they will probably
mention the price. X terminals are inexpensive and are rapidly becoming
cheaper. Their low cost per seat has been a major influence on their
market acceptance. A quick price accounting gives GraphOn a definite edge.

     A complete low-end monochrome NCD XRemote package comes to $3,045
(NCD15b with 5 Mbytes, $2,245, plus XRemote PROMs, $300, plus Sun boot
tape, $500), while the low-end GraphOn, which has no Ethernet capability,
comes in at $1,390 (GraphOn 14, $995, plus Sun boot tape, $395). Both boot
tapes include site-wide licenses, so you pay for the tape only once.

     For the tested high-end monochrome systems, the price disparity is
even greater. The NCD19 comes in at $5,300 (NCD19 with 8 Mbytes of RAM,
$4,400, plus XRemote PROMs, $400, plus Sun boot tape, $500), while the
GraphOn 21 is $2,390 (GraphOn 21, $1,995, plus Sun boot tape, $395). It is
important to note that the prices on the NCD terminals can be cut by
hundreds of dollars if third-party memory SIMMs are purchased.


PHILOSOPHY OF PERFORMANCE

     The NCD19 ran two to three times faster than the GraphOn 21 over
Ethernet, which comes as no surprise to anyone. The NCD has excellent
server software that speaks native X-Window protocol encapsulated by
TCP/IP. The GraphOn 21 has Ethernet connectors and can run over Ethernet,
but the packets contain GraphOn protocol, which is designed for efficiency
over serial links, not Ethernet.

     Over serial links, however, the NCD and GraphOn are comparable
systems. Table 2 is a range chart with a logarithmic scale showing the
ratios of GraphOn 9,600-bps and XRemote 9,600-bps results compared to an
NCD19 SL/IP connection at 9,600 bps. The results are for direct 9,600-bps
serial connections.

     Each box shows the full range of ratios for the given category of
tests from the x11perf benchmark suite. The bold line within each box is
the geometric mean of all the ratios represented by the box. The purpose
of each box is to show how performance varies within each category of
tests.

    In the General Graphics category, the GraphOn results ranged from 0.01
of SL/IP performance to 2.0 times the speed of SL/IP, while the geometric
mean of all the results, the bold line, places the overall score at about
0.2 of SL/IP. The information is incomplete because the box does not tell
you which tests score low and which score high.

    GraphOn tends to do quite well on common X drawing operations such as
thin lines, dots, and rectangles, but worse on less common graphics such
as filled ellipses. The GraphOn has only a small number of drawing
primitives in its terminal firmware, so it has to send many drawing
requests from the host to complete complex graphics. Because NCD's XRemote
is sending X-Window packets, it sends only a few drawing requests to its X
terminal server, and then all the drawing and computation take place in
the terminal.

    The GraphOn performs admirably, however, in terminal emulation, window
management and X-specific operations. GraphOn's slim procotol and split
server personality allow better than or equal performance on common X
functionality.

     Although the results here are for direct 9,600-bps connections, modem
connections at 9,600 bps should be similar though somewhat slower because
of modulation/demodulation and the occasional noisy packet that has to be
retransmitted.

     While the GraphOn does well in these benchmarks, the mostly
host-resident X server steals CPU cycles from the host. For each GraphOn
terminal attached, another X server process is created on the host. Though
the NCD X server runs in the X terminal, the XRemote daemon runs on the
host, and each NCD X terminal attached to the host requires its own
XRemote daemon process. So what percentage of CPU and memory do the
XRemote and GraphOn processes require?

     To get a rough idea, I used a 9,600-bps direct serial connection and
ran three copies of the X demo program ico that displays a rotating
isosahedron. This keeps a continuous stream of packets on the wire. I then
ran the command ps -au every four seconds and grep'ed on the XRemote or
GraphOn process. For the NCD19, the XRemote process required about 3
percent CPU and 3 percent system RAM. For the GraphOn, it was 7 percent
CPU and 6.5 percent RAM. These results suggest that the GraphOn requires
about twice the host resources as XRemote.

     On the purely subjective side of things, I ran several common X
applications such as bitmap and muncher as well as a full-blown commercial
application, Asterix, a spreadsheet, word processor and data management
tool from Applix (508-870-0300).

    The most noticeable effect of running several applications
simultaneously was that the GraphOn handled obscured windows better than
XRemote, because GraphOn was more intelligent about screen updating.

    For those wondering about window manager compatibility, I successfully
ran the Motif 1.03 and OpenWindows 2.0 window managers on both systems.
They also claim to support the DECwindows manager.

    Complete benchmark results can be obtained on the machine uunet.uu.net
(UUNET Communications Services, Falls Church, Va.) in the
/unix-today/benchmarks directory. The file 51391.bench.tar.Z contains the
raw data that was processed using the shell script x11perfcompDR.


A WORD ABOUT 2,400

     The benchmark tests were run at 9,600 bps, but what about 2,400 bps?
Can it be done? The answer is no and sort of. Running SL/IP at 2,400 bps
is out of the question. XRemote at 2,400 bps was barely usable, but was
bearable with no window manager running and only two or three xterm
windows. As you might expect, the GraphOn makes a great terminal
multiplexor and does surprisingly well, though not spectacularly, at 2,400
bps. Continual screen output to one xterm window tended to lock things up
a bit, but was nonetheless usable.


CONCLUSIONS

    For someone who is serious about dedicated serial connections, the
GraphOn is a good pick. Its extremely low-cost, host-based XR3 server and
responsive serial performance make it an excellent choice.

   However, if you ever intend to use your terminal with Ethernet, the
GraphOn will probably disappoint, as it is quite slow and awkward compared
to other Ethernet-connected X terminals. The GraphOn makes the most sense
when used exclusively for serial communications.

   If flexibility and future options are an issue, the NCD has the ability
to run well over serial lines using either its XR4-based XRemote or SL/IP
and, when attached to Ethernet, is among the most robust and
highest-performing monochrome X terminals available.

    The UNIX Today! Labs are distributed among New York, Maryland and
Texas. Technical free-lancers also test products in their labs to our
specifications.

A Look At The Mips R4000 Chip -- Why Mips Selected The Simplicity Of
Superpipelining Over A Superscalar Design

By  ROBERT B. K. DEWAR AND MATTHEW SMOSNA



    In one of the earlier articles of this series, we described how RISC
architects are attempting to break the one-instruction-per-cycle-barrier
through the use of either superscalar designs or superpipelining. Of all
the major players in the RISC wars, only Mips developed an architecture
based on the superpipelined approach. In this article, we will take a look
at that architecture and try to explain why Mips chose superpipelining
over a superscalar approach.

     The R4000 is not only technically interesting, it recently made the
front page of the business section in papers all over the country when it
was chosen as the RISC processor for the newly created Advanced Computing
Environment (ACE), a project including several top software and hardware
companies including Microsoft, SCO, Compaq, DEC as well as Mips (see
front-page article in UNIX Today!, April 15, 1991). The ACE companies
announced that the Mips R4000 is planned as the main RISC hardware
platform for SCO's Unix and Microsoft's OS/2. Notably absent from the list
of companies supporting ACE are other major suppliers of workstations
including HP, Sun and IBM. An interesting contest is shaping up here.


THE MIPS R4000 SUPERPIPELINE

     The Mips R4000 Superpipeline builds on the earlier Mips R3000 chip.
Instead of a simple 5-cycle pipeline, the R4000 uses an 8-stage pipeline.
Notice that two stages are executed in each external clock cycle
(internally the chip subdivides the clock signal, to give an internal
speed twice that of the external clock). The eight stages of the pipeline
are:

     IF: Instruction fetch, during which the first of two instructions to
be fetched into the pipeline is loaded from the instruction cache.

     IS: The second half of the instruction fetch cycle (this overlaps the
following IF phase, i.e., the fetch of the second instruction).

     RF: Register fetch, during which operands in

    Robert B. K. Dewar is professor of computer science and Matthew Smosna
is computer systems manager at the Courant Institute of NYU. They are the
authors of Microprocessors, A Programmer's View, published by McGraw-Hill.

    registers are fetched.

     EX: Execute (the operation is performed).

     DF: Data fetch, during which a memory reference results in the data
being loaded (we hope) from the data cache.

     DS: The second half of the data-cache cycle, which overlaps the
subsequent DF phase (i.e., the second instruction's data cache load occurs
here).

     TC: Tag check, during which an addressing translation tag or TLB
(Translation Lookaside Buffer) check is made.

     WB: Write back, during which the result is written back to the
register file or memory.

     Keep in mind that these stages sometimes have different functions
depending on the instruction that is being executed (for example, an
integer arithmetic instruction will not use the DF and DS stages, as such
instructions can only have their operands in registers-there are no
references to the data cache).

     A very interesting aspect of the R4000 pipeline is the lack of
restrictions on the instructions entering the pipeline. Some
superpipelined processors require the instruction mix to be balanced
(certain types of instructions must enter the pipeline at certain times in
order for the processor to work-the Intel i860, for example). Other
processors, such as the IBM RS/6000, do not require any specific mix, but
do have better performance when the mix it right.

     A superpipelined approach in which two instructions are processed on
each external clock basically performs similarly to a superscalar design
with two separate instruction streams processed in parallel. Comparing the
R4000 to the IBM RS/6000, we might still expect that the IBM processor
have an advantage in that it can issue up to four instructions at once.

     However, Mips claims that in practice this potential advantage is
seldom exploited, and that there will not be a significant performance
difference. Looking at the performance of the RS/6000, we typically see
instruction rates that do not exceed two instructions per clock except in
specialized situations, so this may be a fair overall judgment-of course,
we will have to wait for the first R4000-based machines to be sure.

    Mips claims that the advantage to its superpipelined approach is
basically a much simpler hardware design than the corresponding
superscalar design. If it is really true that there is no substantial
performance difference, then this simplicity is an advantage that may
translate into higher clock rates and cheaper fabrication. Again, we will
have to wait to see whether this theoretical advantage materializes in
practice.


THE INTEGER UNIT

     Although the Mips R4000 distinguishes itself in the use of
superpipelining, it is also one of the first processors to be implemented
as a full 64-bit architecture. The IU registers are 64 bits wide, and the
data paths to the cache are also 64 bits wide. While the R3000 had integer
operations of 8, 16 and 32 bits, the R4000 extends these to full 64-bit
operations while maintaining object code compatibility with the R3000.
These computational instructions are performed in registers, with only two
addressing modes supported: All operands in registers or one of the
operands being a 16-bit immediate value. The instruction set includes
loads and stores that can be done 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits at a time (they
must be aligned), and like other RISC architectures, loads and stores are
the only instructions that can access memory.

    In an interesting change of emphasis, the R4000 uses interlocks, that
is, the instruction that immediately follows a load may use the contents
of the register that is being loaded. The Mips R3000, and earlier chips
produced by MIPS, distinguished themselves by not using interlocks. In
fact, the acronym Mips originally stood for Microprocessor without
Interlocking Pipeline Stages, but now Mips is just a company name that
doesn't stand for anything but itself.

     The integer instruction set is very basic. In the Mips design, RISC
turns out to mean a small set of instructions as well as a simplified
design for instructions. As we have seen on other RISC chips, such as the
HP precision, it is not necessarily the case that RISC implies small
instruction sets, but the MIPS design takes a minimal view-you won't find
decimal arithmetic, fancy shifts or string instructions on this processor!
One small point is that the integer operations have an option to trap
automatically on overflow-a feature that is very useful if you need to
check overflow. (This is required in Ada compilers.) The instruction set
also does include an integer multiply and divide.


FLOATING-POINT UNIT

     The floating-point unit is implemented on-chip (on the R3000,
floating point was implemented on a separate chip, the R3010). It is
IEEE-compatible, with Mips claiming a 25 percent improvement in
performance over the R3010. Until we see benchmarks, it is hard to predict
exactly how fast it will be-it will probably not quite measure up to the
top performance level of the RS/6000, but this depends on what clock
speeds can be achieved.

     The register set of the FPU is configurable as either 16 64-bit
registers or as 32 32-bit registers. Because of the 64-bit wide data path,
loads and stores to these registers can be done in a single cycle (unlike
the 2 cycles required for double-precision floating-point on earlier Mips
designs).

     Fully precise floating-point interrupts are implemented on the R4000.
As we discussed in the last article on the HP PA-RISC architecture, this
allows for user-defined trap routines as suggested by the IEEE standard by
pre-examining any operands that might result in an overflow. This is a
very important feature if overflow trapping is required-by contrast, the
RS/6000 can achieve automatic trapping only by disconnecting the
floating-point pipeline, with a huge execution penalty as a result.


THE SYSTEM COPROCESSOR

     The system coprocessor of the R4000 implements the virtual memory, a
TLB, cache management, exception handling and I/O. It contains its own
internal set of registers for control of these system features.

     The R4000 is able to operate in three modes: a user mode that
provides a flat virtual address space to the user, a kernel mode with four
virtual address spaces and a supervisor mode with two regions. Again, here
the architecture is a full 64-bit architecture, with all virtual addresses
allowing access to the full addressing space (although, for instance, the
user mode gives a user access to only half of the space, the other half
being reserved for the system).

     The effectiveness of the cache is critical to any RISC machine, but
the designers of the R4000 have placed a particular emphasis on its
implementation.

    Both the instruction and the data caches have their own 64-bit data
paths, and both can be accessed independently in a single cycle. Initial
versions of the R4000 will have only 8k bytes of on-chip instruction and
data cache each, but it is clearly the intent here to increase this amount
later. An external secondary cache of up to 4 Mbytes can be added when
required by the system architecture.

     The instruction cache is virtually indexed and physically tagged. As
a result, while instruction lookup is being done in the instruction cache,
virtual address translation is done simultaneously just in case a cache
miss occurs.

    The data cache is direct-mapped write-back cache with a line size that
can be configured as four or eight words. A ``store buffer'' allows the
R4000 to do two stores to slow memory on each cycle.

     The Mips R4000 clearly derives much of its design from the earlier
R3000, but incorporates a significant new design: the superpipeline. In
addition, the FPU has been brought onboard the chip, and the cache design
has been enhanced.

    But the use of superpipelined design is what distinguishes the
Mips-its use differentiates it from other RISC processors. The question
is, has MIPS staked out a claim that will result in beating the other RISC
designs (including the processors that use a superscalar approach, and
also the HP precision architecture, which uses a The floating-point unit
is implemented on the chip.

    conventional approach but a very fast clock?) As usual, we won't
really be able to find out the answer to this question until we get
silicon in our hands and can actually run the benchmarks.

     Another critical issue is the importance of making the jump to a true
64-bit architecture. Right now, 32-bit integers and a 4-gigabyte address
space satisfy most users. Mips is betting that these limitations will
start to hurt soon. The history of computing has been full of statements
like ``No one could possibly need more than `X' memory.'' The first such
statement is attributed to Van Neuman with X = 4k bytes! Are the other
RISC manufacturers who say that no one could need more than 4 gigabytes
making the same historic mistake? Mips thinks they are, and if they are
right, getting there first to the true 64-bit address space could be a
winning move.

Analyzing Program Performance -- Key Tools To Help You Size Up The
Performance Of Your Application Software

By  MIKE CARL



    People the world over are seeing our natural resources less as a

commodity and more as a precious treasure. From toasters to automobiles,
the claims of ``energy efficiency'' are now vogue. Most Unix applications,
on the other hand, tend to need increasing amounts of compute resources.

     Almost weekly, hardware manufacturers crank out faster processors or
higher-capacity memory and storage devices. Just glance at a data sheet
for a typical personal workstation. In order to run a commercial grade of
Unix with an X-Window System, we're talking a 32-bit processor with at
least a 20-MHz clock, 16 Mbytes of RAM and a bare-minimum 100-Mbyte hard
disk.

     With such a configuration, solid and responsive performance should
not be a problem, right? The answer eludes a simple reply, but suffice it
to say that with each gain in hardware performance and capacity, systems
and application software make lock-step demands of these gains to render
new functionality.

    Many users are price-sensitive and can't make the investments in
hardware upgrades. I still see a lot of Sun 3/50s with 4 Mbytes of memory
being used to run an X server and assorted X clients. Or consider the
number of Intel 386 users who are running Unix and X. Obviously,
performance isn't the big attraction; being able to run some of the
exciting new X applications is.

     Lines of source code number in the thousands for many non-X-Window
applications running on Unix. Adding an X-Window interface will make the
application grow like Liz Taylor with a dessert menu. For example, xmh,
the X front end to the MH mail programs, adds more than 7,000 lines of
source code.

     Under that kind of weight, finding

    Mike Carl is a software tester for Teknekron Software Systems in Palo
Alto, Calif.

    and making performance improvements requires time, hardly a commodity
when the release date is near and you are still debugging problems.
However, some primitive performance analysis tools are delivered with your
Unix system.



UNIX TIME

     The first and simplest is the time command. This command exists in
two forms: a built-in portion of the C shell and a program located in /bin
or /usr/5bin on SunOS. The C shell's time command displays statistics
about how a program uses system resources as well as the CPU time spent in
the kernel and in the program. An example run of time on a SPARCstation 2
would be as follows:

        The program being tested here, qsort, generates an array of 50,000
random integers and then sorts them uses the Quicksort algorithm created
by C. Anthony R. Hoare in 1962.

    The 3.1u reveals that qsort spent 3.1 seconds of CPU time in the user
program, while the kernel (or system) took 0.1 seconds to perform services
on behalf of qsort. The third value from the left is the total elapsed
time. The next value represents the user and system time as a percentage
of the elapsed time. Due to rounding, these numbers are not always
precise. The remaining statistics detail the program's memory use,
physical I/O and paging.

     Because Unix is capable of running several processes, time statistics
can be affected by other processes getting a time slice. To better control
such variance, try taking an average of time statistics while the system's
load is low.

     Data gathered here could prove useful as a baseline for
troubleshooting or benchmarking subsequent releases of a program. Thus,
you can see the effect of a new library, or you may even want to increase
buffer size to lower physical I/O.


DID YOU GET A PROFILE?

     When efficiency is important, getting an execution profile is an
excellent first step in finding where a program spends most of its time.
The Unix command prof(1) displays such profile data. Before running prof,
you must first compile the programs to be studied using the -p option of
cc(1V). The prof results for the qsort program above are shown in Fig. 1.

     For each routine, prof displays the time taken by the routine as a
percentage of the total run time of the program (%time), together with the
number of times that routine was called (call) and the number of
milliseconds used per call (ms/call). The cumsecs column displays a
running total of the seconds taken by the routine in addition to the
routines listed above it.

     The figure points out that 43 percent of the program's running time
is spent in a subroutine of the qsort program called partition(). The
partition() routine is the workhorse of the ``divide and conquer'' idea
underlying Quicksort.

     The profile data also reveal a large number of calls made to the
swap() routine (swap exchanges two unsorted elements). Armed with this
data, you can make significant performance improvements by improving the
logic in partition() or by reducing the number of calls to swap().

     Although a lot of information can be gained from prof, it may not be
sufficient to point out every area where improvements can be made. What is
not clear from prof's output is that qsort has a recursive implementation.
The effect of called routines, and routines recursively calling
themselves, is detailed with the profile of each caller in the performance
tool called gprof(1). Your system may not provide gprof. This profile
results from the data file created by compiling the programs with the -pg
option of cc(1V).  Let's get a call graph profile of the qsort program
used above.

     Fig. 2 displays the portion of the call graph profile that reveals
the recursion. The listing shows the routines in order of execution,
including the time taken by any descendent routine calls. To locate
recursive routine calls, look down the column containing ``called+self.''
For quicksort(), one finds the value ``1+69750,'' which means that
quicksort() is ``called'' one time in the main cycle, but quicksort() goes
on to call itself 69,750 times.

     The algorithm chosen for the qsort program need not be recursive. An
equivalent iterative algorithm could have been implemented. Using
recursion, however, simplifies the program and requires fewer variables.
Consequently, the program is easier to maintain and understand. The
downside is that with each recursive call, the function's arguments must
be pushed onto a stack, inflicting a time and space penalty.

     After you've squeezed all the performance enhancements out of your
program, follow-up profile data probably won't reveal any performance
spikes, and the granularity of the data collection will make further
improvements difficult.


STATEMENT-BY-STATEMENT ANALYSIS

     Code coverage performs statement-by-statement analysis on a program
and displays which statements are executed and how many times. Code
coverage can identify areas of code that never get executed, which might
imply areas of code that are not being measured or tested.

     The command tcov(1) produces a code coverage analysis and
statement-by-statement profile of a program. The program must be compiled
with the -a option to produce the analysis. Each time the program is
executed, code coverage data is accumulated in a file with the same name
as the program, but with a ``.d'' suffix. Next, the tcov program must be
executed with the source code file as its argument. Tcov reads the
corresponding .d file and creates a listing of the source with coverage
data in a similarly named file with a ``.tcov'' suffix. Fig. 3 gives the
exact iterations for each statement in the partition() routine.


ANALYZING X APPLICATIONS

     The performance analysis tools discussed so far are most useful for
programs that follow a fairly predictable order of execution. Getting your
arms around the performance characteristics of a program developed for the
X-Window System is inherently more difficult.

     At the heart of a typical X application lies an event loop. The
number and order of the execution paths through an X program depend on how
an end user interfaces with the program. For instance, users can choose
available functions from menus and enter text fields in many different
orders. Even the user's interactions with other applications can affect
the program (e.g., opening or closing another window).

     Add to the above difficulty the distributed nature of the X-Window
System (clients and servers can run on different machines). X application
performance depends greatly on the load on the network and the various
machine loads. The performance of the X server software is also a critical
factor. Although you usually do not have the source code to the server and
therefore cannot change the code, you can improve performance by
determining the best ways to interact with the server.


     Two tools exist today for measuring the display performance of X
servers, namely x11perf and xbench. Let's look at a well-known hot spot
with the performance of an X11R4 server (Xsun) in filling a
100-by-100-pixel trapezoid . Running x11perf on a SPARCstation 2 with
SunOS 4.1.1, we get the 550.0 repetitions/sec for filling a 100-by-100
trapezoid with a solid color; 46.5 repetitions/sec if the trapezoid is
stippled; and 41.7 repetitions/sec if the trapezoid is tiled (checkered).

     Note the factor of 10 difference in filling the trapezoid with
stipples or tiles. The take-home lesson here is: You will be trading away
display performance by an order of magnitude when filling objects like
trapezoids with stipples or tiles.

     Certainly the display speed of an X server will greatly influence the
overall perceived performance of an X client. However, X application
developers should assume worst-case, and code for optimal performance of
their client application. One tool that can be of aid in understanding an
X application's efficiency is xscope.

     Running as a separate process, xscope monitors the connections
between the X11 window server and a client program. Sitting between a
client and an X11 server, xscope outputs the contents of each request,
reply, error or event that is communicated between them. For instance,
with xscope a programmer who made liberal use of XFlush or XSync might
notice several ``replies'' coming from the X server to acknowledge the
client's requests.

     The majority of Xlib calls don't require a reply from the X server.
Consequently, calls that require a reply from the server, sometimes called
``round-trip requests,'' can induce greater network traffic. Although most
traffic generated by X clients and servers rarely taxes the network
bandwidth, prudent use of roundtrip requests such as XFlush() and XSync()
is a good defense against poor performance when the network gets saturated
by a large remote file transfer.

     Complete performance analysis of application software doesn't come
easy, because you are not necessarily seeing solely the performance
characteristics of the application, but also getting variances imposed by
the network, the underlying operating system and other components such as
the X server. You may liken performance analysis and tuning to defensive
driving. While behind the wheel, the defensive driver may not predict all
potential hazards on the road, but tries to see ``the whole road'' and
recognize possible trouble spots.

SORCERER'S APPRENTICE

By  SEAN FULTON



In order to have a fully functional USENET site, you need a news reader, a
news transport and a method to your madness. In truth, setting up USENET
news on an SCO Unix box isn't that difficult if you can get around the
finicky new Microsoft C compiler that complains about sloppy endifs.

     When I moved our 386 from SCO Xenix to SCO Unix last summer, the
biggest problem I faced was pleasing the compiler. Having accomplished
that, maintaining and reading news on our 386 is back to what it once
was-a forgettable task.

     But Unix 3.2 brought with it a host of networking options I never
dreamed of with Xenix, and after carefully weighing our initial steps, I
decided to plunge headlong into the abyss.

      On our Xenix box, all users read news from terminals connected
either directly or via modems. Unix, with its TCP/IP support and NFS,
provides the network allure, a smell of connectivity and openness that I
hadn't even contemplated before.

     Why not set up a system where users on one PC could read news on
another? Colleges and universities do it with Sun and DEC boxes all the
time, so why not tackle the problem on our 386?

     For this project, I used two 386 boxes loaded with SCO Unix 3.2.2 and
TCP/IP.

     To those SCO boxes I added CNEWS source on the server, trn source on
the news ``client'' and NNTP source to both machines. NNTP stands for
Network News Transport Protocol. NNTP allows two forms of networked news
transfer: by article, in a situation such as the one I planned to install,
and by batch, as in two separate news servers sending news batches to each
other over a TCP/IP net.

     The server side compiled with few problems. I built CNEWS first, then
spent the next several hours debugging the NNTP source.

     I also had to do some serious tweaking to the config.h file,
convincing it that I was using the CNEWS dbz database routines, since SCO
Unix did not have its own. I also had to move our CNEWS library files from
the CNEWS source directories to /usr/lib/cnews.a so the compiler could
find them for making NNTP.

     Having accomplished all this, I was able to compile the NNTP server
side of our application with few problems. Then came the hard part. I
built trn, telling it that I wanted to use the built-in NNTP extensions
and the NNTP client resources. After a few attempts at compiling the
source, I realized I needed to move the libcnews.a file from our server
onto the client machine. The file is created during construction of CNEWS,
but apparently it is needed by trn as well.

     The whole mess compiled, and I was ready, I thought, to start some
down-and-dirty news reading.

     But wait! What's this?

    ``usr/lib/news/inews:/usr/lib/news/inews not found . . .''

         I searched through both the trn and NNTP source looking for a
reference to inews, but found none. Somewhere, the NNTP client (a
hard-wired version of inews used to post articles to the remote machine)
had arbitrarily decided that our NEWSCTL directory was the place to find
inews on the server machine.

   Finally short of patience, I simply copied the inews script from our
trn source to the server, installed it in the /usr/lib/news directory and
tried again.

     This time it worked. Within seconds, trn was setting up a .newsrc on
our client machine, then reading in groups from the server. All told, the
project took two days to master, and countless hours of banging on
keyboards and table-tops, but it was finally accomplished.

SYSTEM'S ADMINISTRATION

By  BRUCE HUNTER



Everyone must love the X-Window system, because they all use it. Some
users think that they are not using X-Window, but instead are using Motif
or Open Look; but these are simply different window managers, which all
run on the same X system, as we shall see.

     The presence of X-Window can greatly affect the lives of systems
administrators, giving them many and varied duties-they must request and
install physical resources for X, install the new X releases, create and
install user start-up file scripts, and install and maintain X filesystems
on file servers. They must understand X process management, maintain X's
resource files, and be able to troubleshoot X and understand its resource
requirements.

     X heavily affects the resource use of workstations; X is both CPU-
and memory-intensive. Eight Mbytes of memory are required for monochrome
systems. For color, X requires at least 12 Mbytes for the older and
smaller X10, and 16 Mbytes for X11. Both need a minimum of 4 MIPS and
should have 64 Mbytes of swap space. In fact, X Version 11 Revision 3 is
dismally slow even at 4 MIPS, but it looks great at 18 MIPS. X requires a
high-resolution screen-higher than VGA, so be prepared to invest in
high-resolution terminals or monitors.

     X also affects your fileservers. At least 1/2 to 1 gigabyte of
additional fileserver disk space is required, and additional CPU capacity
will be needed if you use X terminals. We'll get into what those are
later.

     To administer X, you must know how X works, for X redefines the terms
server and client. In fact, the meanings are almost reversed from the
conventional fileserver/workstation relationship. Typically, your
workstation application is the client, and the workstation sends requests
to the server; however, from the X perspective, the terminal server runs
on the workstation and handles your keyboard, mouse and screen, and the
clients are the applications and can run anywhere on the network.

    Most workstation users use their system as their terminal server and
run clients there as well, but remember that the base part of X is a text-
and graphics-oriented system designed to do its work across the network.
Thus, X is designed to run on one system and display on another
(fascinating and compelling to users). As a result, users can run client
processes anywhere on the net that they have access rights, and they can
have the results in graphics and glorious X colors right at their desks.


     X-Window has two major parts. The basic windowing system, X, handles
the graphics, the graphics libraries and the network end (anything
required to make data travel back and forth between the terminal server
and the clients). The window manager (Open Look, Motif, or whatever) is
what users see, and that's what they perceive as X-Window.

     There are many window managers-uwm, twm and mwm (Motif) are just a
few. The choice of window managers is determined in part by the X release;
for example, X10 favors uwm, and X11 favors twm. Sometimes the user needs
a specific window manager for certain applications, such as a special
tool. Also, user preference and prejudice have a great deal to do with
selection of a window manager. For instance, some users prefer the slide
bars on Motif, whereas others fall in love with the ``look-and-feel'' of
Sun's Open Look.

     Tune in next time to find out more about actual X administration
tasks.

A Novel Procurement Program -- Canadian Transport Adopts Far-Reaching Unix
Midrange System Acquisition Program

By  DANIEL R. PERLEY



    In 1988, Transport Canada (TC), the Canadian federal government
department of transportation, initiated an innovative and far-reaching
standards-based procurement program. The Unit Level System (ULS)
Establishment Program has now completed all important vendor qualification
and field trial milestones. While not the first large Canadian government
procurement program to require open systems, the ULS program represented
some noteworthy firsts, even in the North American context.  The ULS
program:

    o Specified a common operating system use profile to promote
portability, scalability and inter-operability, allowing vendors in both
UI and OSF camps to compete;

    o Qualified not one but five competitive vendors (each of which was
required to mount an extensive field trial) and will now bid each system
buy on a price/availability basis among them; and

        o Employs specially trained and certified paraprofessionals as
local system administrators.

    TC has responsibility for the provision and oversight of a safe and
efficient transportation system for Canada and is divided into Aviation,
Airports, Marine, Surface Groups and various corporate/support groups,
together totaling more than 20,000 employees with almost 200 facilities
from coast to coast.

    The department operates numerous Coast Guard ships, a fleet of
fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft and many motor vehicles. It manages
most airports, has responsibility for technical regulation, infrastructure
and traffic control in the air and marine modes, provides technical
regulation of rail and also sets motor vehicle standards.

    By the mid- to late 1980s, TC faced rapidly increasing demand in its
central IBM MVS mainframes/SNA network as well as an influx of many types
of personal computers. In addition, some operational elements operated
various minicomputers, most notably DEC PDP-11 and VAX systems. To ensure
that future capacity demands could be flexibly

    Daniel R. Perley served as director of intermediate informatics at
Transport Canada from 1988 to 1990 and in that capacity conceived and was
responsible for the ULS program. He rejoined the private sector in
mid-1990 and is president of Perley Technologies/PTC, an Ottawa-area
systems consulting firm.

 He met, the Director General Information Management Services (DGIMS)
organization within TC undertook a review of network and processing
requirements, which identified four levels of information management (and
information processing) within TC.  These were:

    o Enterprise (corporate-mainframe)

        o Area (regional-mainframe)

        o Unit (branch or directorate-minicomputer/midrange system)

        o Workplace (desktop or workbench-personal computer/terminal)

        At the workgroup (Unit) level, the department was forecasting a
requirement, over a five-year period, for up to 400 midrange computer
systems for use in information system, operational support, engineering,
scientific and technically embedded computing environments. However, at
that time TC possessed no central midrange system acquisition and support
program and no functional    guidance on the subject; local managers could
(and did) buy many incompatible types of equipment.

    While more than 80 types of PCs had already been acquired, at least
most of them adhered to the DOS/Intel or Mac standards. The prospect of 40
to 50 types of next-generation minicomputers (requiring new support
capabilities) posed a major challenge to senior informatics managers. The
ULS Establishment Program was set up to establish standards,
certification, acquisition channels and support mechanisms for five- to
50-user ULS (midrange) equipment.

    The program began in 1988 with a further internal review of TC
processing needs that highlighted a significant number of pending and
anticipated requests for midrange equipment. The DGIMS Intermediate
Informatics Branch was established to take responsibility for the midrange
computer program within TC. Interim Guidance on Mid-Range Systems was soon
issued, limiting all future purchases to those able to run a Unix
operating system derivative, interface with the IBM SNA network and
support an Ethernet and/or Token Ring LAN Interfaces.

    A multivendor strategy was believed superior either to a single-vendor
approach or one permitting many vendors to supply such equipment, as it
would prevent undue vendor dependence and allow price/performance
competition among a manageable number of suppliers.

    The Treasury Board (TB) of the Government of Canada provides central
coordination and management for government departments and also sets
standards, including technology standards. TB participates in many
international standards groups and had established an open systems
direction for the Canadian federal government. TB recommended POSIX, but
TC believed POSIX alone would be insufficient because TC desired to
exercise data environment, application software and data portability on
three axes:

    o Vertical portability among different sizes of computers at the
Enterprise (mainframe), Area (midframe), Unit (five- to 50-user midrange)
and Workplace (PC/workstation) levels;

    o Horizontal portability among similar computers within one level;


        o Forward portability to replacement computers at any level, and
likely from a different vendor.


    Clearly, POSIX alone would not permit this to occur. A commom
operating system was still required, and Unix was seen as the only viable
choice. Nonetheless, Unix itself was not monolithic; the hoped-for
convergence of ``the world'' into System V.4 was shattered as OSF (and
then UI) burst onto the scene.

    However, TC could not await the outcome of the battle of UI and OSF.
After much soul-searching, it was decided not to specify everything that
an operating system should or should not contain, but rather what part of
it would actually be used and thus must be present. This would restrict TC
software developers and users somewhat, but would permit vendors using
either Unix family to supply equipment while safeguarding portability.
Vendors were free to include third-party products to make up any
deficiencies against the specification.

    In practice, key elements such as kernel and kernel extension, shell
utilities and their extensions and certain other elements were certain to
be functionally common to both Unix families. UI and OSF both added other
elements; suppliers were required to provide everything inside the
vertical column on the functionality map show in the diagram on page 57.
Functionality outside the column would NOT be used by TC.

    This approach was called ``Greater Unix'' or ``GX'' because it made an
attempt to homogenize the difference among Unix variants by setting a
common ``How we will use it'' profile.

    Portability must be supported by several ``pillars,'' of which the
operating system definition or profile (here GX POSIX, with XPG3 added for
good measure) is only one. Also important are adherence to ANSI language
definitions, a common RDBMS (TC chose Oracle), a good development
methodology and use of OSI communications.

    TC first conducted a Demonstration and Evaluation Project (DEP) to
prove key concepts and permit staff to gain experience; AT&T 3B2 computers
served this purpose, with one installed to serve the new Intermediate
Informatics Branch itself in Ottawa and a second in Montreal. A workgroup
data management and work-flow control application called Basic Information
Control System (BICS) was implemented on these systems, along with the
Uniplex Office Automation (OA) package.

    This was followed by a full-scale pretrial, involving 50 users at the
Moncton, New Brunswick, regional Air Navigation office, using IBM RT
equipment. The integration of this system proved vastly more complicated
and time-consuming than IBM and TC had expected; however, it was finally
brought to operational status, at least for OA purposes.

    The pretrial did not fulfill TC expectations when running a multiuser
Oracle RDBMS application environment. However, the pretrial allowed
considerable refinement of administrative and operational procedures. A
much more comprehensive standard site implementation plan was developed,
and the problem of aligning PC terminal emulator key assignments with
RDBMS, OA and OS requirements was addressed.

    A full ULS program workplan was meanwhile approved, and specific
acquisition categories were established for ULS hardware, database
packages, office automation packages, system integration services and
application development services. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was
developed based upon a Qualification and Evaluation Criteria (QEC)
document that set out the parameters not only for paper qualification of
vendors but also for full evaluation in the field trials. The requirements
document placed considerable (and equal) stress on equipment performance,
vendor support and vendor commitment to present and future standards
adherence. A parallel specification was developed for the Office
Automation (OA) package to be run on the ULS. The resulting materials were
approved by a TC national task force and an interdepartmental Procurement
Review Committee prior to release to industry in March 1989.

    After a rigorous RFP process, 10 responses were finally received at
the deadline, on a Friday in September 1989. TC staff worked through the
weekend and faxed the astonished vendors barrages of written questions the
following Monday. TC then undertook a full qualification analysis,
including visits to nine vendor facilities in North America and Europe.
Sites were selected from TC groups, initial qualification and integration
tests were undertaken, and site assignments to the finally compliant
vendors were as follows: Vancouver/Finance (Unisys), Montreal/Airports
(AT&T), Moncton/Aviation (DEC), Dartmouth/ Marine (Bull) and Sydney/
Personnel (HP). All vendors were required to sign a memorandum of
agreement (MOA) with TC regarding their undertaking to integrate and
support their trial system.

    The OA RFP resulted in the qualification of an AT&T/Uniplex and a
Quadratron bid. Each hardware platform was assigned one of the two OA
packages, and Oracle also participated by providing a license for each
system. As the Moncton pretrial had shown, the system integration was a
non-trivial exercise; each ULS had to run OA and Oracle, emulate IBM
3174/3278 equipment and interface successfully with the SNA, interface to
a trial X.25 network linking the five trial sites to HQ, and tie in local
PCs.

    In one site there was an existing HP-3000 mini, which required a
special switch to permit users access either to it or to the ULS to be
installed there. A Generic System Integration Checklist (GSIC) was
developed to give vendors a clear idea of how TC would judge the
completeness of their SI effort; in one case a vendor was actually
disqualified for failure to integrate.

    After the vendors had integrated and made operational their systems, a
series of user and system administrator valuations, formal benchmarks and
vendor service, technology development and standards adherence assessments
were conducted over a seven-month period at the trial sites. During this
period, vendors were not permitted to upgrade the installed technology;
this provided a stable basis for evaluation against the QEC. TC
commissioned Aim Technologies to create a custom benchmark for the ULS
Field Trials, and all five vendors were certified as demonstrating
compliant performance.

    Vendors' original qualification ratings against each requirement were
modified as necessary based on actual experience. The Quadratron and
Uniplex products and Oracle relational database were also evaluated in
service. Each site commissioned an Oracle application to serve local
needs; these were produced largely by contractors under DGIMS oversight.
Also, users and system administrators were asked to rate the systems.

    In parallel with the system specification, acquisition and integration
phases, it was necessary to train and certify a Unit Level System
Administrator (ULSA) to operate and administer each local ULS
installation. These people had some computer experience, but came from an
administrative or support background; they were not computer systems
professionals.

    The ULS RFP contained many requirements aimed at making the
administration of the ULS as simple and easy as possible. TC has developed
a comprehensive ULSA Course, which will be delivered at the Transport
Canada Training Institute (TCTI) in Cornwall, Ontario. The course covers
ULS and ULSA role orientation, Unix, system administration, OA and Oracle
basic administration, LAN orientation and other subjects. Specifications
for an intelligent patch panel or System Integration Branch Exchange for
integration of the ULS with local- and wide-area networks were also
developed. A separate RFP was prepared for certification of system
integration service providers; TC would oversee integration activities,
but would not normally perform them in-house.

    Although time and resource constraints imposed some restrictions on
the portability testing, it was established that the GX POSIX approach
worked well and there was reasonable portability of applications and data.
As the trials have concluded, the five surviving vendors are each in the
final stages of negotiating their Departmental Individual Standing Offer
(DISO).

    Each TC midrange system acquisition will be competed for only among
the five DISO holders, on a price and availability basis. The compliant OA
vendors are also to receive DISOs.

    Funding cuts due to ongoing fiscal restraint have affected the planned
rate of ULS acquisition in the short term. However, TC official Mike
Plouffe, Director General Information Management Services, is confident
the program will be widely used as departmental plans stabilize and the
need for an increased distribution of processing power becomes paramount.

    There was, in strict principle, nothing that confined the GX concept
to Unix; it was thus decided to broaden the definition to potentially
include non-Unix OSes; any OS that can be modified to operate as per the
GX specification could in principle be declared compliant. To reflect this
move toward a more generalized definition of a system executive, as an
operating system is sometimes called, the term ``General Executive'' was
substituted for ``Greater Unix.'' It was also agreed to further evolve the
GX definition to consider key real-time requirements of various federal
agencies so as to ensure the broadest possible future applicability. A TB
Information Technology Standards working group has been formed for this
purpose.

Implementing OOP Designs -- Early Users Discover Promise, Pitfalls Of
Object-Oriented Programming

By  PHILIP J. GILL



    There's good news and bad news when it comes to early implementations
of object-oriented programming (OOP) designs.

    First, the good news. Early users appear pleased with the capabilities
of object-oriented database management systems (OODBMSes). OODBMSes, they
say, enable them to develop applications that support and manipulate new
data types, including images, graphics, video and audio information, in
ways traditional relational database management systems (RDBMSes) can't.
In these cases, users say they choose OOP tools and OODBMSes because their
applications demand them.

    Now the bad news. As much as users appear to like OODBMSes, they
appear to have doubts about C++, which is likely to emerge as a standard
OOP language in Unix and open systems because of its close association to
C. Some call C++ limited, some claim it isn't an OOP at all, others just
don't use it.

        Some users see an OODBMS as their only option. Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratories in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., purchased an OODBMS because it
had to. The non-profit private research foundation specializes in
molecular biology and genetics and related computer disciplines.
Scientists there are developing a molecular genetics research database
that will act as a central repository of information for the Human Genome
Program, a top scientific research priority of the Bush Administration.

    When completed, the database will map the molecular and protein
structures of human DNA, aiding biologists, doctors and others in
developing new treatments for diseases.

    ``The goal is to completely map the characteristics of the DNA of
humans to be able to develop molecular therapies,'' explains Tom Marr, a
senior staff investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Labs. Instead of treating
the visible symptoms of a disease, Marr explains, doctors will treat
molecules to cure disease.

    Marr says molecular biologists discover new aspects of DNA and protein
structure on a daily basis. New techniques such as polymerase chain
reactions (PCRs) unleash an enzyme that artificially amplifies and copies
DNA molecules, enabling scientists to unlock their structure.

    Though Marr uses Sybase's Sybase RDBMS for other applications, the
human genome project research database is being built using Servio Corp.'s
GemStone OODBMS on a Sun SPARCstation. It will run in a client/server
environment across an Ethernet/TCP/IP local-area network (LAN). When it is
completed, users will run the client portion of the database on Sun
SPARCstations, Apple Macintosh systems or DOS-based IBM-compatible PCs,
depending on their preferences.

    Marr says the limitations of an RDBMS' relational data model prohibit
its use in this application. For one thing, the information it will
contain is too dynamic.

    ``The technology is changing continuously,'' he says. ``This field
[molecular biology] is experimental technology right now.''

    Relational systems also can't handle the needed data types.

    ``A relational database stores DNA structure as text and proteins as
text,'' he says. An OODBMS can represent these structures in a graphical
way.

    One strike against the relational model, at least for this
application, is the separation of data and analysis. In an RDBMS,
management and analysis of data are independent of one another, he adds.
The user brings out data from a table, massages or updates it in some way,
then sends it back. But in this research database, the methods for
manipulating data and the data itself need to be closely integrated-a
standard feature in an OODBMS.

    The database is currently at the prototype stage. Both prototype and
production research databases will be written in SmallTalk, an
object-oriented programming language (OOP), instead of C++.

    Interact of New York is also an early user of Servio's GemStone
OODBMS. In this case, the New York-based firm's Integration Products
Division has used GemStone as the framework to integrate various
computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications, including electronic
design, logic simulations and chip and board design. Besides the GemStone
OODBMS, the framework includes Interact's CAE applications and a graphical
editor that let users integrate new, third-party CAE tools by adding a
common GUI.

    According to Gary Putlock, the division's group development leader,
the needs of the framework ruled out their using an RDBMS. ``We choose an
object-oriented database due to the nature of the problem,'' Putlock says.
``The types of data modeling that CAE design tools use don't work with
relational databases.''

    RDBMSes have other limits as well, says Putlock. In RDBMSes, the
database supports relationships and actions between data in fields, but it
does not contain descriptors of the data or allowed behaviors for that
data. OODBMSes, however, do.


OBJECT VS. OVERLAYS

       For some applications, an OODBMS may not be necessary at all. In
fact, an object-oriented overlay to an RDBMS may do just fine for many
applications, according to Dan Gerson, a member of the research staff at
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in Palo Alto.

    Gerson, who works in the collaborative systems area at PARC, is
developing a document database that will allow multiple users to work on
the same document and track multiple versions over a period of years.
Because the document database will contain large unstructured blocks of
text-the most common data type in an OODBMS today-an OODBMS would seem a
natural fit. But Gerson says he's not so sure.

    Gerson, who currently uses a Sybase RDBMS running on a network of Sun
SPARCstation 1s and Sun-4 SPARCservers, recently began to investigate
whether it would be better to develop his document database using an
OODBMS, in particular, ObjectStore from Object Design, Burlington, Mass.

    OODBMSes offer potential performance improvements over RDBMSes, using
pointers to locate objects in the database. Pointers in relational systems
are known to be slower, so an OODBMS should offer better response time.

    But OODBMSes have their drawbacks as well. ``Currently, OODBMSes are
not very well developed,'' he says.

    ``The basic problem in an OODBMS is in the user I/O inside of a
transaction,'' Gerson adds. ``Programs in an RDBMS have a looser
connection to data. Users issue an SQL query, the data base gets a table,
makes a copy of it, and the user looks at it on his screen.''

    During a transaction in an OODBMS, objects are loaded into memory,
either real or virtual. ``As soon as you execute a transaction, you can't
see the object anymore,'' he says. ``In an RDBMS, the system is giving you
some sort of a copy. In an OODBMS, the system is giving you the actual
object, so they're only valid in a transaction.''

    Gerson says he believes few people are aware of this fundamental flaw
in OODBMS technology because so few systems are out there. Those that are,
function as single-user, workstation-based development systems, not
multiuser systems where deadlocks can occur. Besides, he says, he thinks
some OODBMS vendors are either unaware of the possible problem or
deliberately ignoring it.


THE TROUBLE WITH C++

        Users may debate the necessity of OODBMSes, but one thing they all
agree on is that C++, something of an emerging standard in OOP languages
for Unix systems, is something less than they had in mind.

    Software engineers at Teknekron Communications Systems of Berkeley,
Calif., use OOP languages to develop custom network management software
for wide-area network (WAN) vendors. Customers include service providers,
such as the phone companies, and manufacturers of modems, muxes,
multiplexers and other WAN hardware. Typical programs contain 200,000 to
300,000 lines of code and as many as 300 classes of objects in the
hierarchy. Teknekron programmer/developers use a network of 180 to 200 Sun
RISC-based SPARCstations running the SunOS, X-Window and the Motif
graphical user interface (GUI). In the past, most of the code was written
using C-Flavors, a C library that generates a LISP Flavors subset. A few
months ago, Teknekron engineers switched to Saber-C++.

    ``Our customers prefer C++ as the language to use,'' says Peter Ohler,
senior engineer, explaining the move from C-Flavors.

    Ohler says he's ambivalent about the switch.

    C++ does strong type checking before compiling a completed program to
check for bugs. That's good, says Ohler, but it's also bad, as it provides
no way in C++ to foil the strong type checking mechanism. That limits what
Ohler calls the ``genericity'' of object classes. Once an object has been
created, he says, the functionality of that object can't be used in any
other class types other than those with inheritance from the original
object.

    ``The class may be unrelated, but you might want to use the same
functionality,'' he says.``That's not possible. You can't drag the line of
inheritance.''

    Two alternatives exist. The most practical, says Ohler, is to do what
his technical team does: They write some code in standard C to get around
the strong type checking. The other is to create hundreds and hundreds of
classes to prepare for any programming contingency, an untenable option.

    SmallTalk, the earliest object-oriented programming language, doesn't
have this restriction, notes Ohler. But, he says, strong momentum is
building up for C++ despite its limitations because of its close
relationship with C and open systems standards in general.

    ``We have a saying around here that C++ is a better C language, but
it's not an object-oriented language,'' adds Ohler. ``There's no
fundamental OOP model or paradigm. It's a non-intuitive and inconsistent
language.''

    Marr of Cold Spring Labs says he prefers not to use C++.  All the
development work for the molecular structure research database is done in
SmallTalk. ``A lot of it is personal taste,'' Marr explains. ``C++ does a
lot of things with multiple inheritance I don't like.''

    Xerox PARC's Gerson also believes there are problems with the C++
language. For one thing, he says, it does not support full data
abstractions.

    ``Let's just say that C++ gives you object-oriented structures,'' he
says. But, he says, there is a solution. ``Adding a preprocessor will take
care of many of the problems with C++.''

Judging OODBMS Performance

    Much has been written about the performance of relational database
management systems (RDBMSes), but many users know little about how to
judge the performance of an object-oriented database management system
(OODBMS).

    There are a number of ways to judge OODBMS performance, some of which
are similar to an RDBMS, some of which are not, according to Gary Putlock,
group leader of development for the integration products division of
Interact, a New York City software developer.

    ``There's raw access performance, which can be equivalent to a
relational system,'' he says. Just as with relational systems, users can
judge OODBMS performance in response and data access times, says Putlock.

    ``Other aspects of performance correspond to flexibility,'' he
continues. ``How well does it perform in a multiuser situation?''

    Putlock says this remains an important question, as some vendors have
implemented their OODBMS products for single-user workstation
environments, not as a multiuser, network server.

    Another question to ask, says Putlock, is whether or not the OODBMS is
not just a single-user system, but can function in a distributed,
heterogeneous network environment.

    Putlock says Interact chose GemStone as the base for the framework
because it supports multiple hardware platforms. Interact's The Integrator
CAE framework, developed on top of the GemStone OODBMS, runs on Sun-3s and
SPARCstation 1s as well as IBM RISC System/6000 workstations in an
Ethernet/TCP/IP local-area network (LAN) environment.

    Putlock adds that users should also concern themselves with a
prospective vendor's stability, the richness of the OODBMS' development
environment, product reliability and support.

E&S Gets IDC Tool

By LEE BRUNO



    Salt Lake City-Evans & Sutherland Computer has signed a strategic
joint marketing and development agreement with Image Data Corp. (IDC) of
Pasadena, Calif., to port Image Data's imaging technology to its graphics
workstations.

    The agreement will allow E&S hardware to be sold with IDC software
products. Specifically, 2-D imaging software, which is a part of IDC's
Para/Series application software, will be bundled with Evans &
Sutherland's ESV workstations, the company said.

    With the agreement in place, Evans & Sutherland said that it plans to
increase its ability to address the general visualization market by
including imaging and graphics technology in each workstation. The company
said it can now cost-effectively bundle the image and graphics technology
because of the declining cost of memory and the increase in processing
power.

INDUSTRY WATCH

By  JOHN CHISHOLM



With IBM's loss of more than $1 billion last quarter, due at the root to
the erosion of market share of proprietary MVS to Unix, the Apple
Macintosh is now the last major proprietary system to maintain sales
momentum. The Macintosh is indeed closed: MacOS, A/UX and their
applications run only on Macs from Apple Computer; and Macs run MacOS and
A/UX and no other operating systems. MacOS applications cannot readily be
ported from Unix or DOS/Windows, and vice versa. How much longer the Mac's
momentum will last is impossible to tell, but being closed does not help.

    To be fair, Mac has a strong, loyal installed base and is today
gaining low-end market share with its Macintosh Classic. But Mac overall
is being overtaken by Microsoft Windows 3.0, whose development and
promotion is supported by dozens of hardware vendors; and by Intel
platforms, with their wide choice of systems software and strong
price/performance due to competition among many vendors. The very closed
strategy that insulates Macintosh from competition today will hurt it
tomorrow. To be successful in the mid1990s and beyond, Apple must play the
same game and subject itself to the same market forces as its PC and
systems software competitors.

    That means licensing to other vendors MacOS and the MacROMS, the
proprietary heart of the Mac. Doing so creates Mac competitors, but ones
from whom Apple earns revenue in licensing fees. It also creates
complementary Macs-notebooks, servers, fault-tolerant systems-which
increase the size of the Mac market. Setting license fees is tricky: too
low and the licensees are all-too-plentiful competitors; too high and
they're unsuccessful customers. The best way for Apple to manage these
conflicting objectives is to do as the Compaq-Microsoft combination does
and as Sun is beginning to do: split into separate hardware and software
profit centers and let each contend with its own competitors.

    To compete as an open systems supplier, Apple will also need the
price/performance of RISC. SPARC would make Mac a Sun clone; Mips, an ACE
(Compaq/DEC) clone. Given the choice of being qualitatively different from
or merely quantitatively better than SPARC or ACE, Apple has the customer
base, brand-name following and product differentiation to be different.
This makes the 88000 the best available RISC choice for future Mac
workstations and servers, in my view. The 88K's primary fault, accounting
for its distant third place in RISC market share after SPARC and Mips, is
not the CPU itself, but lateness to market in 1988 and lack of multiple
sources. Lateness to market then doesn't much hurt Apple today, and Apple
should be able to negotiate with Motorola for multiple sources.

    Assuming Apple adopts the 88K, should it join the 88open Consortium
and comply with its compatibility standards? That would help 88open, whose
members are all second-tier players-DG, Unisys, Omron, Encore,
Harris-trying to win sales by being compatible with each other. Like the
Eastern Bloc countries, they are trying to prosper by trading among
themselves when what they really need is a major power to join them. Apple
would be that major power, as Sun is to SPARC and Compaq hopes to be to
ACE.

    Supporting 88open could also help Apple. True, the five hundred or so
88open-compliant applications pale in comparison to the number currently
available for the Mac. But Apple would gain multivendor compatibility and
a strong claim to ``openness'' with a group of companies that not only do
not threaten Apple but that would be happy to let Apple lead them. Unix
System V.4 with the Mac GUI and MacOS API could well become a new 88open
standard.

NIST Unveils Graphics Test Suite

By  LEE BRUNO



    Chicago-The National Institutes of Standards and Technology has
unveiled a computer graphics test suite aimed at protecting users and
ensuring that vendors' hardware platforms and applications conform to a
standard way of exchanging picture information.


    The validation test suite is based upon the ANSI/ISO standard data
interchange format, called the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM). The CGM
is a standard file format and represents a graphical snapshot of a final
screen image.

    Essentially, the CGM test ensures that graphical picture information
conforms to the CGM standard and can be exchanged between different
hardware platforms and software systems. NIST said the aim of the test
suites is to ensure that graphical picture information can be ported to
different graphical devices.

    The CGM testing suite consists of three components: a generator that
produces the file; the CGM file; and a CGM interpreter, which is capable
of reading the CGM file. NIST said the CGM interpreter and generator test
suites are currently under development.

    NIST said it developed the validation test suites because vendors were
using different CGM formats that did not permit users to exchange
graphical files. The incompatibility arose, NIST said, because the
semantic specification within CGM was ambiguous. Within the CGM standard
test suite, there are three encodings of the metafile syntax that include
binary, character and clear text characteristics. The CGM standard has
been adopted for federal use in the Federal Information Processing
Standard, or FIPS.

    The purpose of making the CGM test files available is so vendors can
determine if their products conform to the federal standards required by
government departments and agencies purchasing computer equipment.

    Upon completion of the test, a report is generated that summarizes the
testing procedures and results for the CGM. The report provides a list of
tests performed and errors found. In addition, the test identifies whether
the CGM met the conformance testing of the CGM standard.

    The Computer Systems Laboratory of the NIST said a Unix-based CGM
should be in 1/4-inch tape format to be tested. The CGM test for one to
five metafiles costs $800 and includes the CTS/Metacheck license. With a
CTS/Metacheck license, the cost is $500 for testing one to five metafiles.
For additional information about NIST's CGM test service, call
301-975-3365.

Sun Reports Higher Profits

    San Francisco-Sun Microsystems recently announced that profits for its
third quarter increased a total of 59 percent over the similar period last
year. The figures were far in excess of industry analysts' estimates.

    Sun reported earnings of $58.7 million, or 56 cents a share, for its
third quarter ending on March 29. Its earnings for the same period last
year were recorded at $36.7 million, or 40 cents a share. Sun also said it
shipped a record 48,000 units this quarter, with sales to the commercial
sector accounting for approximately 30 percent of its revenues.

    In a prepared statement, William J. Raduchel, Sun vice president and
chief financial officer, said that the quarter ended with a ``record
backlog of orders, almost $700 million in cash and a financial sheet
that's never been stronger.''

Baan Licenses Triton

    Holland's Baan Info Systems plans to step up worldwide sales of its
Triton Unix-based manufacturing software through licensing agreements it
recently signed with five hardware vendors, said Adrian Neele, the
company's general manager for North American operations.

    Most recently, Baan Info Systems signed a joint marketing agreement
with NCR, under which each of the two companies will sell NCR's System
3000 computers bundled with Baan's software. Baan will pay $1.5 million to
NCR over the next 18 months under the agreement. Baan has signed similar
joint marketing agreements with Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Digital Equipment
and Bull, according to Neele.

    ``Hardware vendors are pushing hard on us because we're well
established,'' Neele said. ``It's not easy finding a Unix software company
with 10 years in the field.''

    Baan has been selling its products in Europe for a decade and in the
Far East for five years, according to Neele.

    Baan's product line includes Triton-Industry, which supports
manufacturing operations such as routing, planning, shop floor control as
well as group technology; Triton-Trade, which is a stock purchase and
sales control program that optimizes the flow of goods through a company;
and Triton-Finance, which helps to automate administration and accounting.

Legislating Computer Conduct

    It is not uncommon today for our society to be described as litigious.

    The popular-and justified-rationale for that accusation is that people
are using judges, attorneys, lay juries and millions of taxpayer dollars
to settle business disputes that could much more easily and intelligently
be settled otherwise.

    Not only are many such lawsuits premature, but they are sometimes
downright inappropriate. There are some disciplines where the disputes can
be of such a technical and complicated nature that it is almost impossible
for lay juries to sort out fact from fiction, or to evaluate which party
in a given conflict is acting more unfairly.

    Today, the computer industry is just such an entity. As technology
changes, as high-speed workstations put the power of international
networks at the fingertips of an insurance company executive or a
pharmaceutical chemist or a department store's head of inventory, the
rules governing computer conduct are going to have to change.

    Two recent events make it clear how the current legal system is
ill-equipped at the moment to craft the changes that society needs:

    o  Attorneys for Robert Morris decided last week to ask the Supreme
Court to overturn the federal appellate panel's ruling upholding Morris'
conviction for unleashing the 1988 Internet Worm.

    o  Steve Jackson Games, a games and publishing company that had much
of its computer equipment and some unpublished manuscripts seized last
year by the Secret Service during its anti-cracker sweep Operation Sun
Devil, has sued the Secret Service and the U.S. Justice Department. Not
only was Jackson's company never accused of a crime, but, the lawsuit
contends, it was never even suspected of wrongdoing.

    The Morris appeal hung on a definition of access to a computer
network, a question made complex because Morris already had accounts on
several legitimate systems in the network. But with their attempts to
comprehend finger daemon, sendmail and worm, the jury-based on juror
comments after the trial-didn't even try to wrestle with that issue. The
judge who presided over the trial opted to not even explain the concept-a
major element of the defense's case-to the jury because he didn't want to
cloud the issue. There was substantial question whether the judge himself
understood the argument.

    The Steve Jackson Games case is probably the most frightening of all.
In that case, we have the Secret Service candidly saying that this is such
a new area of the law that they had very little idea how to pursue an
investigation. Their approach was to conduct search warrants on many
locations, seize everything that could possibly be computer-related and-in
the ensuing months-figure out if they had come upon anything.

    As computer technology reaches farther and farther out into
non-computer-literate society, society is going to insist on it being
controlled by some authorities. Today, those authorities often do not
understand the technologies they are now being told to supervise.

    If users want their high-technology activities regulated by those who
understand the intent of their efforts, then it is urgent that the
computer industry establish its own method of regulating security.
Otherwise, it will be done for us.

Benchmarks Key To Making The Right Deal

By  M. ANDREW BARLOW



    The standard benchmark in today's workstation market is a powerful
tool when the customer knows how the benchmark relates to the workload of
the application. If the customer does not know this, it can lead to
confusion and the wrong buying decision.

    The standard benchmark is critical to the buying process, for it can
be used to narrow the playing field of possible workstation alternatives
(and get through Door No. 1 of a sales process). If possible, however,
final buying decisions should be made based on the results of Door No.
2-tests that reflect the primary or heaviest use of the system. These
tests should include evaluations of application performance,
interoperability, the operating system and system reliability.

    The most common benchmarks in use today are MIPS, MFLOPS and, most
recently, SPECmarks. Each of these benchmarks measure a portion of the
system's total performance. MIPS measures CPU integer performance, MFLOPS
measures CPU floating performance and SPECmarks measure integer,
floating-point and cache performance. A strong showing on these benchmarks
can be a good indication of a system's performance. The challenge for
customers is to understand how a specific benchmark can help indicate how
their application will perform on a given hardware platform.

Graphics, I/O and networking may also be bottlenecks and therefore may
require other benchmarks because they are often measured using different
parameters by each vendor. To date, no one has developed one benchmark
that measures all these factors to predict total application performance.

    Other considerations usually need to be taken into account before the
final buying decision is made. These are the considerations behind Door
No. 2. The most important is the application that will be run. An
application will put a unique stress on the system. Capturing a typical
workload and running that workload on the system of interest can be the
most important step in understanding how the workstation will perform.
Benchmarking at this stage is a far more expensive task and is not easily
standardized.

    Due to the complexity of measuring system interoperability, a
benchmark for this has not yet been developed. The same applies to
operating systems. A customer typically buys one application, but has many
kinds of workstations.

    Finally, system reliability is critical. A system that is down for
even a few minutes will quickly lose any gains reflected in a particular
benchmark.

    Improvements in standard benchmarks continue to be made. SPECmarks,
for instance, have gone a long way toward improving the measurability of
overall system performance. The SPECmark, however, typically is quoted as
one number, when in reality it consists of a suite of 10 tests. The
results of these individual tests can be very helpful in predicting future
application performance. The GPC graphics benchmark is another good
example of a standard benchmark.

    Finally, some vendors are developing measurement tools to help
customers better understand how their application stresses the system.
Information gained from the use of these tools will add more value to the
benchmark and lower the cost of making a buying decision. Perhaps, with
more support for committees such as SPEC, a buying decision can be made
solely on the results of one benchmark.

Architect Draws On RS/6000's Resources To Reconstruct Lost Abbey

    Reaching into the past has always been the domain of science fiction.
But imagination, with the help of computers, can sometimes achieve
analogous results.

    Such was the case recently in France, where architect Philippe Lorimy
used an IBM RS/6000 with computer aided-design software to reconstruct the
lost Benedictine Abbey of St. Guilhem-le-Desert. The abbey, located 18
miles from Montpellier on the southern coast of France, was an important
stopover for the various religious pilgrimages that wound their way from
Spain into France.

    The 3-D computer models provided Lorimy with drawings that were
finished by hand, filling out the details and contours of the time. ``If I
had to draw these totally by hand, I'd never have been able to do it
because it would have been so time-consuming,'' Lorimy said. As it was,
the designs took approximately 10 days to finish.

    The abbey and the nearby Church of Gellone, first erected in 804 A.D.,
were rebuilt or modified in the 11th and 12th centuries after being
damaged in France's religious wars and the French Revolution.

    Lorimy's various drawings are due to be published in a book titled St.
Guilhem-le-Desert: The Sculpture of the Cloister of Gellone.

It's A Scientific Fact: This Flock Of Gray Eagles Loves A Good
Party

    Americans don't usually like to call attention to their age,
especially if it exceeds 29. But a group of graying computer executives
who call themselves the Gray Eagles is proving there is an exception to
every rule.

    No, this isn't a militant new division of the Gray Panthers working on
behalf of senior citizens, but a group of Data General alumni with roots
to DG in the mid-'70s and a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit.

    Members of this group have played key roles in such companies as
Apollo Computer, Convex Computer, Stratus Computer, Alliant, Lotus
Development, Access Technology and Mips Computer Systems. Twenty-seven
Gray Eagles work at Mips alone, including Bob Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer, and Chuck Boesenberg, president and chief operating
officer. One Gray Eagle at Mips prefers to call the Mips group the Gray
Teenage Mutant Ninja Eagles.

    So, what do all of these Gray Eagles do?  They all meet once a year at
Comdex in Las Vegas for a national get-together, network among themselves
throughout the year and, most importantly, throw parties on a regular
basis. Not a bad way to age.

Striking A Blow For Accuracy: Did Early Koreans Find The Key To Software
Quality?

By MITCH WAGNER



    Software engineer Martin Minow writes in the on-line RISKS-FORUM
Digest:

    Is it possible that the solution to the software quality crisis was
discovered in Korea in the 15th century? The following is from Daniel J.
Boorstin's The Discoverers, quoting, apparently, Kim Won-Yong, ``Early
Movable Type in Korea'' (1954):

        ``The supervisor and compositor shall be flogged 30 times for an
error per chapter; the printer shall be flogged 30 times for bad
impression, either too dark or too light, of one character per chapter.''

     Boorstin continues, ``This helps explain both the reputation for
accuracy earned by the earliest Korean imprints and the difficulty that
Koreans found in recruiting printers.''

    The RISKS-FORUM Digest is an on-line newsletter that is available over
the Internet through anonymous ftp, and over USENET as comp.risks.

Profits Translate To Lots-O'-Pizza At Data General

By  EVAN SCHUMAN



    Ever have one of those days when the boss dumps this impossible
project into your lap at the last minute, and then tells you that he knew
about it a week ago but kept it from you ``as a matter of policy?''

    Pantelis Venetis knows that feeling well.

    Venetis owns the small pizzeria at the corporate headquarters for Data
General in Westboro, Mass. A few minutes after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, April
24, Venetis-who says he normally makes about 80 pizzas a day-was told that
he had until the next morning to create 1,800 pizzas for a DG pizza party
feeding 2,463 employees.

    ``I tell them, `Impossible,' '' Venetis said, his voice smothered in a
thick Greek accent. ``They say I gotta do my best. I got a little
nervous.''

    DG officials wanted the bash to celebrate the second consecutive
profitable quarter for the struggling computer company, good news that
executives attribute partly to DG's powerful AViiON line, which uses a
pizza box-shaped CPU.

    Those officials maintained that they could not tell Venetis about the
planned pizza bash one minute before the stock market's 4 p.m. close
because of the possibility that the 13-year DG employee might
inadvertently leak the news.

    Venetis said that when he got out of the meeting that afternoon, his
crew had already gone home. So he called his wife and told her to
immediately get 10 pounds of yeast-somehow.

    Firing up the store's two ovens, Venetis and another employee worked
through midnight making enough dough for 1,200 pizzas. After catching a
few hours' sleep, he returned to DG at 3 a.m. and-with an eight-person
crew-continued the pizza preparation with an eye toward cooking beginning
at 7 a.m.

    But, Venetis told his bosses, he was not going to make 1,800 by the
morning. No way.

    It was then that the telephone rang for Scott Whitman, the store
manager for the Southborough restaurant of Domino's Pizza. It was a DG
official asking for a delivery of 150 pizzas by 11:15 a.m. and an
additional 100 pies at noon. The order was later increased to 275.

    ``He was a little stunned at that point,'' said Randy Soper, the
franchise area supervisor for Domino's. ``On an average Thursday, he could
have expected orders for maybe 65 or 70'' pizzas.

    But splitting the order between stores in Southborough and Framingham
made the job doable, said Soper, who spent much of that next morning
kneading dough.

    ``We were just cranking out pies. One guy slapping them down and one
guy saucing,'' he said. ``It was conveyor-belt pizza-making at its best.
This is the largest single order that our company has ever had'' in
Massachusetts.

    When they delivered the order, they found themselves greeted with no
tips (So THAT's how they are now profitable!) and a DG manager who stared
at his watch and wanted the $3 off because they didn't make it in 30
minutes.

    ``We don't have our guarantee over 10 pizzas,'' Soper said, adding
that he told the DG manager that he was willing to make an exception for
DG. ``I volunteered to give him $3 off the whole order'' costing ``a
little more than $1,700.''

    To make matters easier for the Domino's crew, toppings were avoided
and all 275 large pizzas were just plain cheese. Venetis' batch included
600 pepperoni and 300 mushroom pies.

    Ironically, this job might have been easier for Venetis two years ago
before major DG layoffs dwindled the number of workers at headquarters.how
would it have been easier? The irony is that those layoffs are the main
reason for DG's current profitability. ``A year ago, we used to make 200
pizzas a day,'' he said.

    When the 22-year-veteran pizza man was asked how the pizzas tasted
after all the insanity died down, he laughed. ``I didn't taste any of
them. After you make 1,000 pizzas, how can you be able to eat them?''

    (Evan Schuman is the news editor at UNIX Today!) Editor's note: In the
next issue, Mitch Wagner will take up where he left off last time with the
story of the Tetris hackers.

IOMEGA'S ZIP IS OMN'S PRODUCT OF THE YEAR

      Forget the maxim: "If you build it they will come."  What
apparently works to sell removable storage devices nowadays is low
pricing and narrowly targeted marketing.  In 1995, this was proven
dramatically by OMN's Product of the Year: the Zip drive, made by
Iomega Corp., of Roy, Utah.
      Two other storage devices that debuted last year deserve to be
runners-up: phase change dual, or PD and Apex.   Both of them
represent new directions and opportunities for the optical storage
industry.

A Sexy Package for Younger Users

      The hottest ticket of 1995 was a sales receipt for Zip: the
$199, 100-MB 3.5-in. removable magnetic disk cartridge system that
went on sale at the beginning of the year (OMN, Jan. 17).
      Stan Corker, director of removable storage research for
International Data Corp., told OMN that he expects Iomega to have
shipped "just under a million" Zip units in 1995, and forecasts it to
ship "three-to-four million" units in 1996.
      An Iomega spokesman declined to cite end-of-year sales figures. 
He told OMN simply: "By November, we'd shipped our one-millionth
personal storage solution, but that includes not only Zip but Ditto
[quarter-in. tape drives], as well."
      Whatever the actual numbers, it's safe to say that Iomega sold
hundreds of thousands of Zips last year--a figure that is an order of
magnitude higher than that of any competing removable disk product,
especially optical.
      There's no arguing with success, and there's no secret to how
they did it.  Iomega wrapped the drive in a standout purple box; gave
it a slangy, sexy name; and backed everything up with magazine ads
aimed directly at the hottest demographic bulge: the 18-to-35-year-
olds whom TV networks also covet.  Computer users in that age bracket
don't have much experience with removable storage beyond floppies,
except maybe quarter-in. cartridge (QIC) tape.  And, of course, Iomega
positioned Ditto to reach them too.  These younger users also aren't
loyal to 3.5-in. MO or to SyQuest Technologies' established lines of
magnetic disk cartridge drives.
      Iomega made one mistake: it didn't realize how big the demand
would be.  The external Zips are still selling at full list price, and
there are backlogs in most channels.  
      Iomega had to sign up Seiko Epson as a second-source (OMN, Dec.
5,; July 18,).  This year, assuming that production rises as expected,
Fuji Photo Film USA and Maxell Corp. of America will brand and sell
Zip drives in the United States.  It's as if Zip opened a new product
category: bigger than a floppy, but not too big and not too expensive. 
"No one else recognized the importance of a sub-$200 price point,"
said Corker.
      Since August, Iomega has been offering an internal SCSI version
of Zip to OEMs; and it showed an internal IDE version at Comdex. 
Both, according to the Iomega spokesman, "could be retailed at some
future date."  OMN has learned that Iomega also is working on a
thinner internal version, to be sold on an OEM basis to portable- and
laptop computer makers.  Even at a premium price, such a subsystem
would find a ready market.
      Around mid-year, SyQuest dashed in with a competing product:
EZ135, which costs about the same ($239, external version), yet holds
more data and transfers it faster.  The usenets (user-group bulletin
boards) that OMN reads are full of happy testimonials for EZ135,
although some users who have tried both report that Zip is easier to
install.

The Might-Have-Beens

      But competitive performance alone isn't the name of the game any
more.  Zip is what retail customers are asking for by name, and a
stroll through the aisles of retail computer stores during the holiday
shopping season showed that Zip was more prominently displayed.
      This "new" category that Zip seems to have generated could have
come to life years ago, with the arrival of Floptical or of 3.5-in.
MO.  But both those products fell short of defining the niche and
attracting users.
      Floptical blended optical and magnetic technologies: a 21-MB,
3.5-in. magnetic disk with a laser-guided head.  21 MB seemed like a
lot five years ago.  If it had been less expensive it might have
generated a big installed base.  But it also was inadequately
promoted, and was soon overshadowed by SyQuest's aggressively marketed
(and ultimately very successful) 44-MB and 88-MB, 5.25-in. product
line.
      A consortium of Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics Industries Ltd.,
Compaq Computer Corp. and 3M Co. is trying to revive the Floptical--in
principle--with a 120 MB drive that also will read 1.44 MB floppies
(OMN, Aug. 1,).  But users today pay practically nothing for their
floppy drives.  With Zip and EZ135 already on the shelves, it's likely
that this revival will close out of town.
      3.5-in. MO drives also could have been the gotta-have-it storage
gadgets if they would have been launched at a far lower price ($2,000
in 1991), or had dropped below $1,000 quickly.  
      Instead, 128 MB drives were sold mainly into a captive personal
computer market in Japan, and never aggressively marketed in the
United States.  With no significant installed base here, manufacturers
were slow to innovate: they took more than three years to not-even
double its capacity to 230 MB, and those drives have only now broken
through the $500 floor.
      The Zip experience also proves that either of these devices
might have done (at least a little) better if they'd been promoted
with some pizzazz.  (Iomega Corp., 801/778-1000.)

PD COULD BE WINNER AT THE `RIGHT' PRICE POINT

      Phase change dual (PD) systems, which debuted in 1995, also
could define a new product category; but PD has a narrower window of
opportunity than Zip, and faces a potentially more powerful competitor
in CD-R.  PD's recent retail price drop below $500, however, should
give it a boost in 1996.
      PD is made by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., of Osaka,
Japan, and is distributed in the United States under four brand names:
NEC, by NEC Technologies, of Boxborough, Mass.; Panasonic, by
Panasonic Communications & Systems Co., of Secaucus, N.J. (a
subsidiary of Matsushita); Plasmon, by Plasmon Data Systems, of
Milpitas, Calif.; and Toray, by Toray Marketing & Sales America, of
San Mateo, Calif.
      With a single tray-load mechanism and a multipurpose head
configuration, PD offers the equivalent of two valuable drives in a
single enclosure: a 650 MB rewritable optical disk subsystem and a 4X
speed CD-ROM reader.  It can read CD-ROMs (and recorded CD-R media)
because phase change technology exploits domain reflectivity in a way
that is similar to that of CDs.
      PD was announced more than a year ago (OMN, Sept. 27, 1994,),
but production was stalled while Matsushita finalized specifications
of its disk format (OMN, April 24,).  This delayed the launch until
mid-year (OMN, Aug. 29,).  List prices, which began just under $1,000,
were reduced in November to about half that much (OMN, Nov. 7,).
      Steven Yuhas, president of Panasonic Communications & Systems,
told OMN in December that "we think we've reached the right price
point now.  The user gets a 650 MB optical disk system for only about
$300" (that is: for the difference between the PD's price and that of
a 4X CD-ROM reader, which also fell in 1995 to about $200 today).
      The internal version of PD conserves expansion slots--also a
benefit, but mainly for OEMs.  Compaq Computer Corp., of Houston,
Texas, has entered into an OEM agreement with Matsushita/Panasonic to
sell PD drives in its computers.  Panasonic and the others are
advertising PD, but additional computer makers will have to cut OEM
deals to actually put PD in front of more people.  Most users still
don't know about storage options anyway, beyond tape backup, and they
face too many choices when they do go looking for storage devices.
      The end-user market is extremely price-sensitive.  As CD-ROM
reader prices continue to fall (6X readers now retail for less than
$350), the pressure on PD's price structure will not abate.  It is
almost impossible to purchase a personal computer (PC) today without a
CD-ROM reader; and systems costing more than $1,500 typically come
with a 4X reader.  The extra cost of PD pushes PD-equipped systems
higher, but they're still within most business users' budgets.
      Price aside, what the PD vendors need to stress is value.  PD is
arguably the least expensive way to store 650 MB on a removable disk. 
A 5.25-in., 1.3 GB MO drive will continue to cost more than twice as
much, notwithstanding the closeout price of discontinued IBMdrives:
under $750, while supplies last (OMN, Aug. 15,).

PD as CD-ROM's Disc Image?

g disk-based competitors, the chief rival to PD is CD-R.  While CD-R
has been used primarily as a database publishing medium, and has more
recently been able to serve (via software) as a data backup device,
CD-R disks are not bootable, nor (being write-once) do they behave
like floppy or optical disks.  PD, by contrast, offers floppy-like
user familiarity, generates bootable disks, and uses rewritable media.
      With bundled software, some CD-R drives now cost less than
$1,000 (OMN, Nov. 21,; Oct. 10,).  These are relatively slow drives,
and the accompanying programs are not the ultra-sophisticated
authoring or mastering tools.  Nonetheless, a $1,000 CD-R drive, with
its sub-$10 media, undeniably is a bargain, since its disks can be
read by practically every CD-ROM reader or CD-Audio player ever made.
      A PD drive can read CD-ROMs and CD-R discs, but CD-ROM and CD-R
drives can not read PD media.  PD users will be able to share media
only with other PD users, while CD-R users gain leverage from being
able to reach literally millions of Compact Disc users.
      But synergy is possible.  PD can be used in the content
development/software authoring stages of making CD-ROMs.  The disks'
storage capacities are roughly equivalent, and the making of CD-ROMs
almost always requires dedicating a hard disk drive (HDD) to the "disc
image" under development.
      PD is nearly an order of magnitude faster than tape, and almost
as fast as an HDD (since phase change is a direct-overwrite
technology).  Being removable, PD media offers an added advantage over
HDD by enabling several versions of a project to coexist
simultaneously while they're being tested and compared.  (Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. +81/3-3578-1237.)

APEX AIMS HIGH, WHILE MAJOR COMPETITORS STICK TOGETHER

      The biggest storage news story of 1995 was the appearance of
Apex, a 4.6 GB 5.25-in. MO subsystem from Pinnacle Micro Inc., of
Irvine, Calif. (OMN, Aug. 1,).  It's a stunning technical achievement;
had the drives been shipping in quantity by now, Apex would have been
OMN's Product of the Year.
      The rest of the MO manufacturers last year coalesced around a
2.6 GB upgrade from 1.3 GB, and resolved to follow a migration path
that could bring backward-compatible 5.2 GB drives to market in 1997
(OMN, Oct. 24,).  By sticking together with "standard" products,
however, these manufacturers run the risk of being stuck with them if
Apex takes off.
      Apex offers more than just higher storage capacity.  It's
specified to have a direct-overwrite capability for extra recording
speed and to list for only $1,700: two-thirds of the announced debut
prices for 2.6 GB drives.
      Pinnacle's strategy for marketing Apex is twofold: to build
awareness of what a 4.6 GB removable storage device can do, by
advertising it in end-user and industry publications; and to
concentrate on making OEM sales to computer makers (the announced OEM
price is $800).
      In November, Pinnacle signed its first OEM deal, with Intergraph
Corp., of Huntsville, Ala., (OMN, Nov. 7,).  OEM sales represent a new
direction for Pinnacle, which has long offered standard products
(albeit in innovative packages), and has therefore depended almost
exclusively on retail and integrator channels.     

Some Glitches

      Pinnacle plowed nearly all of its last-year's profits into
developing Apex, setting up a manufacturing plant for it in Colorado
Springs, Colo.  Some component glitches--which are inevitable with any
new venture--have delayed Apex's full production until the first
quarter of 1996.  Sample units shipped before year's end do not
perform certain functions exactly as originally specified (OMN, Nov.
21,).  But vice president Scott Blum assured OMN in December that
production units would meet all performance specs.
      Blum's enthusiasm for Apex is palpable: he is the driving force
behind Apex's development; his company, though publicly traded since
mid-1993, is still largely controlled by his family; and his father,
Bill Blum, is president.        Pinnacle's stock currently is trading
close to its high for the year; and last month the company declared a
50 percent stock dividend, giving shareholders one extra share for
every two that they held as of Dec. 1.

What about Direct-Overwrite?

      Contrary to OMN's report of Nov. 21 (OMN, Nov. 21), which was
based on information provided by Scott Blum, Pinnacle does not license
its direct-overwrite technology from Nikon Corp. of Japan.
      In a manual that Pinnacle distributed to prospective OEMs,
Pinnacle stated: "Apex will also be one of the first ... optical disk
drives to support Direct Overwrite (DOW).  Media has been developed
that allows single-pass writes instead of the two-pass write media
used in existing drives.  The technology uses Light Intensity
Modulation Method (LIMM)."
      This method, abbreviated "LIMM-DOW" (alternatively, "LIM-DOW"),
was developed by Nikon.
      As OMN reported, Pinnacle's media supplier is Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. (MCC).  Blum told OMN, "I believe MCC has a
license that allows them to make the LIM-DOW media.  MCC does the
initial stage; Nikon puts on their layers; then the media returns to
MCC for the final stages.  There is involvement from Nikon to some
extent--that's what MCC told me."
      According to Shinya Sasayama, general manager of Nikon's Optical
Storage Division, in Tokyo, the only outside LIM-DOW project with
which Nikon is currently involved is a joint endeavor with Hitachi
Maxell Corp. to develop 2.6 GB media.
      Asked to clarify this inconsistency, MCC director Yoshimitsu
Kobayashi told OMN:  "Unfortunately, I can not comment on anything
about [4.6 GB] media and LIM-DOW media just now."

Standards vs. Progress

      The first 2.6 GB drives were shipped by Most Inc.  The next
company to roll out the drives will probably be Maxoptix Corp., which
will likely be followed by Hitachi America and Sony Electronics Inc.
(OMN, Nov. 7,).  Nearly every other MO manufacturer is expected to
offer a 2.6 GB drive in 1996 (see related story, p. 7).
      Technical standards for the 2.6 GB capacity point, to which
these manufacturers prefer to adhere, were developed within the X3.B11
committee of the International Standards Organization (ISO).  Pinnacle
is an ISO and X3.B11 member, and has proposed that its Apex
specifications be accepted as a new 4.6 GB standard.
      But the decision to migrate methodically, doubling capacity
every two years, was made in meetings of the Optical Storage
Technology Association (OSTA), to which nearly all of the other
manufacturers--except Pinnacle--belong.  They are positioning their
2.6 GB drives against Apex by emphasizing backward-compatibility:
being able to read existing 650 MB media and to read and write 1.3 GB
media.
      Users who are ready to move up, therefore, must weigh the OSTA-
compliant alternative: simply swap out an old drive for a new 2.6 GB
drive, with very little downtime or reconfiguration necessary. 
Switching to Apex probably means running dual systems until all
important data has been ported over to the more capacious media.  On
the other hand, Apex poses no such dilemma for new users.
     Standards, even de facto standards, are a mixed blessing: they
encourage conformance but inhibit innovation.  It's hard to make a
"standard" product sexy.  Yet to succeed, the OSTA-compliant drive
makers must market more aggressively than ever before, especially to
new users.  Even without Apex, there are ongoing challenges that they
ignore at their peril.  Magnetic tape will not go away.  In the
removable optical disk market, CD-R is nibbling at the low end, while
12-in. is beckoning at the high end.  And high-capacity hard disk
drives are getting cheaper all the time.
     Pinnacle, at least, recognized this and is doing something about
it.  The OSTA members may squirm to acknowledge the fact, but Apex
represents genuine progress.  Its aggressive price/performance point
could give the whole industry a long-needed shove in the right
direction: straight into the minds of new users.  (Pinnacle Micro
Inc., 714/789-3000.)

NEW CHIP SET OFFERED FOR ERASABLE CD-R/E

     To build an erasable version of the recordable Compact Disc (CD-
R), prospective drive makers will need to incorporate a new integrated
circuit (IC).  It's model SAA7390, manufactured by Philips
Semiconductors, a Sunnyvale, Calif., subsidiary of Philips Electronics
NV, of Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
     This IC is specified to support 6X reading and 4X writing, with a
maximum burst data transfer rate (into the external interface IC) of
16.9 MB/sec.  "Third level error encoding and decoding in hardware is
included [as is] an easy-to-use memory management system with ten
layers of arbitration," according to marketing manager Sunil
Nethisinghe.
     Philips, he said, also will offer prospective CD-R/E drive makers
"total systems packages [that] are expected to reduce the drive
development time by about eight months."
     The SAA7390 is priced at $25 in 10,000-unit orders, and is
scheduled for release in January.

Can CD-R/E Compete?

     The erasable system, which is expected to debut this year, was
called
CD-E, but has recently been designated CD-R/E by its developer,
Philips Electronics NV.  Besides CD-R, its chief competitor will
probably be phase change dual (PD; see related story, p. 3).  But for
two reasons, the contest may not turn out to be close.
     Like PD, CD-R/E employs phase-change technology (OMN, July 18, p.
6.  But CD-R/E drives and media will be more expensive than PD or CD-
R: at launch, perhaps at least $2,000 for the drives, with $25 media.
     More problematic for CD-R/E, however, is the fact that the
media's recording layer has a lower reflectivity than that of CD-R or
that of the data layer in a CD-ROM.  Thus, the present installed base
of readers and recorders can not read CD-R/E discs (OMN, Aug. 15, p.
7).  Only CD-ROM and CD-R drives manufactured after 1995 will have the
newer circuitry that makes them sensitive enough to read CD-R/E media.
     Of course, no one knows how quickly (or how many) CD-R
manufacturers will make the switch, nor how soon the unsold
inventories of older CD-ROM readers will be depleted, allowing the
channels to make room for the new ones.  (Philips Electronics NV,
+31/40-73-48-66; Philips Semiconductors, 408/991-4540.)

LOW-PRICE UPGRADE WINDOW STILL IS OPEN FOR MO AND PD

     There still is a chance for 3.5-in. MO and phase change dual (PD)
systems to seize market share along the storage upgrade path.  Very
soon, Zip users will find they need more than 100 MB, and that
magnetic disk cartridges can't meet every need.  But they won't want
to spend more than $500 on a solution.
     The only near-term upgrade on Iomega's horizon is an order of
magnitude bigger--the 1 GB Jaz--which has not yet shipped, and is also
incompatible.  SyQuest already is overextended with too many
incompatible product lines and doesn't have an EZ135 upgrade ready to
roll out either.  Nomai, which makes SyQuest-compatible products (OMN,
Aug. 29,), doesn't have the advertising budget to compete with Iomega
or SyQuest.
     Since users will have to buy something incompatible with Zip,
there's a window of opportunity in 1996 for optical disk vendors to
meet the move-up needs.  The end-user prices for 1.3 GB MO drives
probably will fall below $1,000, as vendors clear their shelves to
make room for new 2.6 GB drives and/or Pinnacle's Apex.  But that's
still a lot of money for the "average" user; and 5.25-in. media still
will cost about $80.

PD is the Better Deal

     Today's 230 MB 3.5-in. drives will have to come down under $300
very soon or they'll be squeezed out once again: by Zip below and by
their own 640 MB and 650 MB cousins above.  Those higher-capacity
drives, however, were announced long ago (OMN, Nov. 22, 1994,) and
have yet to appear on the market.  When they do, they'll probably list
for about $1,000.  At half the price, PD is a better deal.
     There's money to be made in 3.5-in. MO, but only Olympus and
Fujitsu seem to have coherent strategies for staying in that business
(OMN, Aug. 15,).  Olympus is going for high performance (2.61 MB/sec
specified maximum data transfer rate), while Fujitsu is making a fast
but modest-priced model for the desktop and a slower, but very thin
model for OEM-ing to notebook computer makers.  (Apple [AAPL] is
Fujitsu's first OEM customer.)
     Within the PD community, a viable strategy would be to encourage
content providers actively to "master" their CD-ROMs on PD, and--at
the same time--to persuade replicators to accept PD disks (along with
tape and CD-R media) as mastering media sources.  PD might then become
a respectable niche product in a niche market.  CD-R (if not CD-R/E)
still will be gaining.
     All the optical disk system manufacturers, ISVs, systems
developers and retailers this year would be well-advised to market the
concept of removable storage aggressively; to target the most likely
new users and advertise to them heavily; and to push prices down to
build an installed base. 

**********************************************************************

                   OLYMPUS UNVEILS `SUPER-FAST' MO DRIVE

     Olympus Image Systems Inc., of Melville, N.Y., has a 2.6 GB 5.25-
in. magneto-optic (MO) drive that it claims will be "the fastest ISO-
compliant MO drive in the marketplace."  Sample units reportedly were
shipped in December, with production quantities set to ship in "the
first quarter of 1996."  Pricing is not set yet.  The drive, model
MOS540E, has 4 MB of on-board memory and is specified to have a disk
rotation speed of 3,600 rpm, producing a specified data transfer rate
of up to 4 MB/sec and a seek time of 26 msec.  Olympus Image Systems
is a division of Olympus Optical Co., of Tokyo.  (Olympus Image

HONORABLE MENTIONS FOR OMN PRODUCT OF THE YEAR

     Many products were newsworthy in 1995, and are therefore worth
calling attention to once more.  Besides the significant achievements,
there also were a few products of more transitory--if not dubious--
value.
     * 12-in. Systems Get Bigger.  ATG Cygnet, Nikon Corp., Philips
LMS and Sony Corp. all announced higher capacity 12-in. optical disks. 
Nikon launched its 8 GB rewritable MO drive in the United States,
though it has been available for years in Japan.  Philips began
shipping a substantial upgrade from its original RapidChanger.  Sony
announced a 15 GB drive--though it has yet to explain how that drive
will read Sony's older disks.  ATG Cygnet topped the capacity charts,
promising a 16 GB system in 1996 (OMN, Oct. 10,; April 24,; April 10,;
March 27,).
     * Real Progress in Jukeboxes.  ATG Cygnet's 12-in. jukeboxes
already support other manufacturers' drives--not only ATG's.  So it's
logical that the Cygnature jukebox series should be able to support
not only optical disks but CDs and magnetic tape (OMN, April 10,). 
Gateway commissioned Sanyo to build a three-disc CD jukebox (OMN, May
23,).  Several vendors began selling Nakamichi's seven-disc CD jukebox
(Jan. 3, p. 6), and NEC released its four-disc half-height CD changer
(OMN, Nov. 21,).  Hewlett-Packard gave its SureStor jukeboxes a two-
disk transport mechanism (OMN, Feb. 14,).  And Smart Storage
discovered how to get a CD jukebox to read and write simultaneously
(OMN, Nov. 7,).
     * SD is Finalized.  The next generation of CDs will be pretty
much what Toshiba Corp. and its allies wanted, with one technical
concession to the competing Sony/Philips group.  Yet ironically, in
December, the participants announced that the new multigigabyte media
will be known as "DVD"--just what Sony and Philips proposed.  "DVD"
doesn't stand for anything (one vendor suggested "digital versatile
disk"), but the products will be distinguished by extensions, e.g.
DVD-Audio; DVD-Video; DVD-ROM, etc. (OMN, Sept. 26,).
     * `Intelligent Media' Appears.  Software Architects released
software that lets PCs read Macintosh disks.  This was one of those
"if they can land a man on the moon, why can't they ...?" conundrums
that the computer industry failed to answer for ten years.  Hats off
to the product, Here & Now (OMN, July 4,).
     * Where Are They Now?   OMN also was able to offer one fleeting

WORLD AIDS DAY EVENT FOCUSES ON WORKPLACE ISSUES

World AIDS Day Event Focuses on Workplace Issues features
guided dialogue with local talk show host David Brudnoy, WBZ
Radio's News and Program Director Brian Whittemore, and
Brudnoy's physician, Dr. Deborah Cotton

The New England Corporate Consortium for AIDS Education -- in
commemoration of World AIDS Day -- will hold its annual
business breakfast on Friday, December 1 at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston. The theme is "Shared Rights and Shared
Responsibility," focusing on creating supportive work
environments for employees affected by the HIV disease.

The meeting will center around a guided dialogue entitled
"Managing AIDS in the Workplace -- the Triumph of Reason and
Compassion: The David Brudnoy Story." Brudnoy, a nationally
recognized critic, author and well-known television and radio
talk show host, will speak of his own experience living and
working with HIV disease. With his manager, Brian Whittemore,
and his physician, Dr. Deborah Cotton of the Harvard Medical
School of Public Health and the Infectious Disease Unit of
Massachusetts General Hospital, Brudnoy will discuss the
issues and decisions that are key to managing AIDS in the
workplace.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are
approximately 17 million HIV/AIDS infections worldwide, and
predicts up to 40 million infections worldwide within five
years. Among the 50 states, Massachusetts has the 10th highest
number of AIDS cases. From July 1994 to July 1995 there were
1,396 new cases reported. This represents a 23.1 percent
increase over the previous year. It is estimated that 90
percent of those infected with HIV are employed.

"The New England Corporate Consortium for AIDS Education was
formed in 1987 because AIDS/HIV disease is a business issue,"
said Paul Ross, chairman of the New England Corporate
Consortium for AIDS Education and manager of the AIDS Program
Office at Digital Equipment Corporation. "Business must take a
leadership role in combating both AIDS/HIV disease and
AIDS-related discrimination by encouraging effective AIDS
education and ensuring compassionate treatment for those
affected by AIDS/HIV."

The New England Corporate Consortium for AIDS Education is a
group of 20 companies spearheading the region's fight against
AIDS. The group's charter is to stimulate private sector
leadership in responding to AIDS. The companies, each of which
has its own internal AIDS awareness program, have developed
AIDS education materials that are available to businesses
through the AIDS Action Committee and the American Red Cross.

BEST WESTERN HOTELS SELECTS DIGITAL ALPHA SERVERS,
PCs TO POWER NEW GLOBAL RESERVATION SYSTEM

Best Western International, Inc., the world's largest hotel
brand, has selected multiple AlphaServer 8400 "TurboLaser"
systems, the world's most powerful servers, together with
thousands of Digital personal computers, to power Best
Western's new worldwide central reservation system (CRS).
Digital and Best Western announced this agreement, among the
largest AlphaServer 8400 sales to date, at the International
Hotel/Motel & Restaurant trade show here.

When fully implemented, the deal will be worth more than $12
million in Digital revenue. A total of 10 AlphaServer 8400
systems will power Best Western's operations center central
host server, located in Phoenix, Ariz., as well as BWI's
reservation centers located in Phoenix, Wichita, Kan., Dublin,
Ireland, and Milan, Italy. The new servers will run Oracle7
relational database management system with the 64-bit Digital
UNIX operating system, handling in excess of 2,000
transactions per second. AlphaServer systems will replace
outdated and over-extended mainframes.

In addition, Digital will deliver some 3,500 Digital Venturis
535 PCs to every Best Western property worldwide, where they
will provide a full range of inventory and rate management
capabilities. This part of the system will enable hoteliers to
enroll in Best Western marketing programs and create their own
programs and pricing packages.

"Today we unveil the hotel industry's most ambitious, advanced
customer reservation system. We selected the
Digital/Oracle/UNIX solutions because of its superior
performance, flexibility, and growth potential -- at one-tenth
the cost of competing systems," said William S. Watson, Best
Western International's executive vice president.

"We expect the Digital/Oracle solution to dramatically improve
our ability to respond more rapidly to customer needs, to
quickly provide our client agents more and more relevant
information on our customers' travel preferences, to increase
our sales and revenues, and to enhance our company's image,"
Watson added.

The new system is expected to to generate more than $50
million in incremental annual room revenue and will
significantly reduce corporate and property level operating
costs.

Pace-setting Global Reservation System

Best Western's new central reservations systems, scheduled for
a March 15, 1996, start-up, offers unprecedented features and
functions, both at the property level and at the Best Western
central reservations offices. It will be a service
enhancement for the 40 million travelers worldwide who stay at
Best Western hotels each year.


With the new CRS, Best Western will be the only hotel chain to
provide comprehensive geographic, pictorial, and textual
information to its reservation sales agents. These features
will enable guests who call a Best Western central reservation
office from any location, whether at home or on the road, to
find the Best Western hotel that is closest to their desired
destination.

The new system will enable Best Western to provide detailed
guest histories, group booking capabilities, revenue
management service, travel agent commission data, and a wide
range of property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
service, travel agent commission data, and a wide range of
property-specific and destination information.

Yet the new system is much more than a traditional
transaction- oriented network. It will provide the business
tools to more clearly target and service BWI's existing and
future customers.

"Best Western recognizes that emerging technologies will bring
radical changes to the way products are distributed to its
customers. This vision led Best Western to select Digital and
Oracle as technology partners for the new millennium," said
Pauline Nist, Digital vice president of the AlphaServer
Business Segment. "While Best Western customers may never know
what's 'under the hood' of the new reservation system, Best
Western managers will sleep better knowing our systems are
providing those customers the fastest, most reliable services
in the travel industry."

Digital's AlphaServer 8400 Systems

AlphaServer 8400 systems are based on the world's fastest
microprocessor, the 300 MHz Alpha 21164. They support up to 12
64-bit processors and 14 Gbytes of memory, and can be
clustered for far greater performance.

Recently, Digital and Oracle together shattered the
transaction processing world performance record in benchmark
testing (tpcC) defined and audited by the independent
Transaction Processing Performance Council. This was
accomplished on an AlphaServer 8400, Digital UNIX operating
system, and Oracle 7 database system. The Digital/Oracle
solution bested the previous record held by Hewlett Packard by
75 percent, and was far better than the best systems from IBM,
Sun, AT&T, and Tandem.

Taken together, the 64-bit Alpha technology, 64-bit Digital
UNIX, and 64-bit databases such as Oracle7 enable the
breakthrough performance and price/performance of VLM64.
Digital is unique in the industry in its ability to deliver
this capability to customers today.

Applications such as data warehousing, financial management,
and online transaction processing take particular advantage
of VLM64 solutions. This is because more than 4 billion times
more data can be stored in memory than even the most powerful
mainframe systems, at a fraction of the cost. This provides
dramatic improvements in processing speed, application
performance, and system affordability.

Digital's Venturis PCs

Digital Venturis is Digital's value-oriented desktop PC family
designed to meet the computing requirements of general
business users in standard office applications, as well as
those of users in a client/server environment. Ideal for the
volume purchaser, Venturis systems are simple to install, easy
to use and easy to maintain, while providing room to expand as
computing needs evolve.

THE BOFH CHRONICLES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

I get into my office and it's my first day I want to make a good
impression, so I empty my IN tray into the bin. Now that's what I call
efficient!

I log in to my account and there's three helpdesk mail requests, all
ticking away to expiration, then escalation, then further escalation,
then followup mail message, then even further escalation, then 2nd
follow-up mail and casual phone call, then still further escalation,
then non-casual phone call, then threats, then, ultimately, and sadly,
violence. But not so sadly that I won't resort to it. And they know I
will too...

Because I used to be... the Bastard Operator From Hell!
 ...and sometimes, late at night I get these twitches. Like dead people
get. (Or, as I prefer to call them, perfect computer users)
In the mornings I get them too. Like when the phone rings. And when I
get e-mail. And when people talk to me. AND when people are hogging the
expresso machine to make fluffy milk. But apart from that I'm cured. A
new man.

I smile at the thought and look, in reminiscence, at some reminders of
my past.

A couple of backup eight-mm tapes with cartoons on them. The thank-you
cards for my attendance at 23 separate funerals of computer center
staff. The 230V AC mains plug with the thinwire ethernet plug at the
end. I didn't ever get round to trying that one either, so I don't even
know what it would've done.

I'm bored.

The Bastard Operator From Hell steps up the ladder... he's now the
Bastard System Manager From Hell

I get up and slip a fingerprint-free magnet on top of the reed switch
that the Boss had installed in my display cabinet while I was on
holiday, then pry the glass door open with a screwdriver. As far as I
can figure, the switch is supposed to ring an alarm if the door is
opened.

Silence. I grab my etherkiller and wander down the hallway to the
switchboard, applying another magnet and opening that to silence as
well.

That's what's missing in society today trust.

I pull the 15-amp breaker for the meeting room, then wander on round and
plug the etherkiller into a cheap timer set to 5 minutes from now. On
the way back to the switchboard I hear the first few murmurs about
excessive collisions. I plug in my unpatented nail "fuse" (estimated
fault current 200-300 amps) with a set of heavily insulated pliers and
wander off to the tea-room to start my expresso brew. Halfway through
the make, the machine stops. Now that's what I call a collision.

I look around in a bewildered manner as panic erupts on all sides,
half-made expresso in my hand. I step out into the hallway and behold
pandemonium. Two programmers are fighting over a CO2 fire extinguisher
in an effort to put their terminals out. I wander down to my room just
as my X terminal, the unreliable piece of excretia it is, flames it's
last and lapses into a dull smoulder.

"My cabinet!" I cry in `horror' and hear the extinguisher struggle end
abruptly. In a flash the two programmers concerned are behind me staring
into my room. Shortly thereafter the boss runs up as well.

"What's this magnet for?" I ask, picking it up and hearing a bell start
chiming in the distance.

"You bastard!" one of the programmers utters.

"I'm sorry?" I ask, turning.

"YOU did it didn't you?"
"What? Break into my own cabinet? But I've got a key."
That's the terrible burden of proof really in this day and age, you
need some to make an accusation.

The late-breaking news comes in that one of the consultants had a set
of head-phones plugged into a CD-ROM drive hanging off their networked
PC. But not anymore. Now there's an unexpected vacancy in the
department. I blame the Ethernet Isolation specs. Three kV my backside!
Soon, I'm helping the police with their enquiries.

"What is this, can you tell me?" a burly officer asks, right up in my
face. He holds up a magnet.

"It's a magnet. There was one on my cabinet!" I cry.

"Yes. And where did you get them?" he asks, seizing control...

 ...and losing it.

On my cabinet! I just said!"

"No, not this one. The others. Where did you get them?"

"Others? What others? You mean there were more on my cabinet! Why?" (I
can play the "stupid game" forever, having had years of education at the
hands of users.) ...

A couple of hours later I'm back at my desk with Mr Lucky, no charges
pressed. I close my cabinet, satisfaction mine for the first time in a
long while.

Then the phone rings...

I get a call from the big boss he's been getting complaints about the
trainee bastard operator from hell. I ask him to forward all the
complaints to me and that it would be best to let me deal with them. I
ring the operator and get him to make an appointment with me.

Two weeks later, he does, and I show him the complaints that have
accumulated so far.

Seventy Three complaints in your first three weeks!" I say "It's
good but it's NOT Good Enough! You should be getting at least 10
complaints a day AT LEAST!

Now, let's see what you're doing wrong: You get a call from a user what
do you do?"

"Kill them off?" The TBOFH replies

"NO! How can you kill them off if you don't know their USERNAME? Your
FIRST priority is to get their username. Then what would you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"NO! Get them to tell you what their problem is!"

"Why?

"Because later I can say they didn't explain their problem to you
properly. It's a great defence works every time. A user rings me up to
complain; I listen to their problem, then say "Oh, when you said `my PC
doesn't work' he must have thought you meant `how can I make my PC never
work again and destroy my life's work at the same time?' it happens all
the time!' Then they tell me implausible that is, I say how terribly
sorry we are, then fake some connect and CPU time records so their
monthly bill is about the same as the Uraguayan national debt. So, after
you've heard their problem, what do you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"NO! Then you make up some excuse. Have you got an excuse card
calendar?"

"Uh. No.."

"And you said you were qualified to operate a computer! You'd better
have mine." I pass my computer card calendar over, flipping it to page
one "ENTROPY"....... ...I like it.

Now, you give the cretin an excuse. Then what do you do?"

"Kill them off?"

"YES!" (He certainly has a fixation) "Then what?"

"Hang up?

" "NO! Then they'll call you back when the problem recurs. Your job is
to make them FEAR calling you. How can you work when people are calling?
So, you make them pay for calling in the first place. What would you
do?"

"Delete their files?"

"Yeah, it's a start, but then they may call back when they get new
files. You want them NEVER to call back. What could you do?"
Swear at them?"

"No. I can see we'll have to demonstrate. Have you got a metal
ballpoint?"

Yes"

"See that wallsocket over there. Take the refill out of the pen and poke
in into the wallsocket."

"But it's live!"

"Would I really make you do it if it were live?" "
Oh." *fiddle* *fiddle* BZZZZZZZEEEEERT!

Of course I would. He was no good anyway.

LEISURE - BOOKS: LEARNING DELPHI THE DUMMIES WAY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by VKT

This book is already into its second edition, and Rubenking has done a
good job. However, it is not intended for any dummy programmer.

The book starts with a formal introduction to Delphi (as is traditional
with a Delphi tutorial) covering the most important component of
Delphi the form component. Then it goes on with using other components
explaining the basics of how they are arranged on the component palette,
how to include them in your application, how to set their properties,
and how to write the event handlers. The author then discusses the
components on the standard palette, the dialog components and the menu
components.

This follows a comprehensive discussion on a variety of the additional
and advanced components, file components and database components all on
the palette along with all their important properties and events. The
text is laced with examples that range from simple to smart. In deed the
thoroughness with which the author covers the ground makes this an ideal
text book for discussion on Delphi components the informal presentation
notwithstanding.

The book also deals with Win 95 components and two chapters on Delphi
programming that cover units, form files, projects, resources, major
features of Object Pascal, and writing and debugging code. The usual
Dummies feature "Parts of Ten" offers a chapter each for Ten Common
Mistakes, Ten Windows API functions and Ten Fabulous Functions Families.

This is probably the best starter for aspiring Delphi programmers that
we've come across recently. And even for experienced programmers, its
comprehensive coverage of all the components on the palette make it a
worthwhile quick reference. The best part is its price; to use a cliche
it is a steal.

LEISURE - BOOKS: MULTIMEDIA ADVENTURE WITH VISUAL C++

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by VK Thakur

This book covers advanced Windows multimedia programming techniques in
Visual C++ 2.x and is aimed at advanced Visual C++ programmers. Since
Visual C++ is very close to the Windows API, even Visual Basic, Delphi
and Pascal programmers with a penchant for resorting to Windows API
would find the book extremely useful.

The authors have gone to a considerable extent in explaining the
fundamentals and the techniques rather than just throwing a lot of
arcane C++ code at the reader. So, it is easier for a developer using a
different development environment to port the code that comes in this
book to the environment of his/her choice.

The initial chapters cover basic HyperMedia and teach you how to create
HyperText jumps with the CScrollView class of the MS Foundation Classes.

This is followed by an introduction to the Windows Multimedia System
with examples on how to use sndPlaySound() function and the high level
mciSendString() and mciSendCommand() interfaces.

Next, the authors concentrate on Imaging. After an introduction to
bitmaps and palette management the pace gets lively as the authors
provide a delightful insight into Palette Animation, ROPs and special
visual effects (such as Dissolves). With the pace still lively, the
authors return to HyperMedia this time focusing on HyperImaging. They
start with the code for a simple hotspot editor and went on building a
full-fledged hotspot editor that can mark irregular regions of an image
as hotspots. The discussion ends with a full-featured HyperMedia engine.

The reader is then taken through a breathtaking journey into the
wonderworld of animation simple as well as sprite. The book also covers
how to play audio CDs, the MIDI standard, and the MCIWnd interface for
playing AVI files.

It comes with a CD-ROM packed with the source code and executable of
the impressive projects, such as the sprite and HyperMedia engines,
covered in the book. Besides, the CD-ROM lets you have a look at some
useful shareware apps as well as video clips, sound files and music.

Multimedia programming is arguably the most difficult type of
programming that requires skills as well as imagination. If you want to
join the select band of multimedia application developers, not by using
authoring tools but a programming environment, this book is for you.

LEISURE - BOOKS: NETWORKING IN PLAIN ENGLISH

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by PR

Doug's style of presenting technophobic stuff is both funny and
encouraging. However, the absence of effective illustrations may divert
your attention from the boring text-only approach. Although
well-written, unlike most of his other titles, this book does not assume
readers to be dummies. It takes a straight-forward approach to demystify
the magic that allows you to share a printer or to exchange documents
electronically with your colleagues and friends.

All the 30 odd chapters in the book by and large center around Novell
NetWare. Written in a logical sequence, each one covers a specific
aspect of networking network hardware, printer sharing, network
security, trouble shooting, connecting to the Internet, and building an
intranet infrastructure. Interestingly, it's more like a reference you
won't have to go through cover to cover just turn to the chapter you're
interested in and start reading.

Each chapter is further divided into self-contained modules that all
relate to a basic theme. For instance, Using Network Printers contains
nuggets such as ports and printer configuration, redirecting printer
output, playing with the print queue and what to do when the printer
jams. Network Security deals with user accounts, passwords, privileges
and access rights, and tips for managing multiple servers.

The title also packs a variety of icons corresponding to different types
of technical tips, tricks and warnings. For instance, a warning to the
network administrator regarding the authorization of user accounts says:
"Beware of the all-encompassing "*" wildcard. If your network has an
account whose user ID is simply "*", delete it as soon as you've created
your permanent accounts. The "*" account allows anyone to access the
system, no matter what user ID he or she enters."

The other stuff you can extract from this guide is a variety of
interesting and informative tips on advanced networking features,
including remote networking, connecting to the Internet, and creating
your own intranet. However, the information on sharing CD-ROM drives or
a Fax, setting up a voice mail system, playing network games,
understanding Internet addressing, setting up an Internet/intranet site
using popular Web servers including MS Internet Information Server and
NCSA HTTPd, could have been more informative.

An extensive "Part of Tens" is the most encouraging module of this
particular Dummies title. This includes 10 Big Network Mistakes, 10
Network Gizmos (Only Big Networks Need), tips on networking Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 and Macs, and information on a variety of programs that
make networking easier. There are also three comprehensive command
references on NetWare, LANtastic and Windows (WFW 3.11, Win NT, and Win
95) networking to help keep your network under control. This title won't
make you a network expert; nor would you find it interesting if you
don't like reading long text-only articles. However, it's definitely a
good and handy reference for most local area networking needs.

LEISURE - BOOKS: A CRASH COURSE ON NETWORKING

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

by Pinaki Ray

If you use Novell NetWare and find it very complicated, this book is for
you. The first 24 chapters are so well written that you can master these
concepts in so many days, by devoting at least two hours a day to each.

Take another six days to practice what you've learned, and you will find
your so-called `stupid' network as friendly as it could ever be .And to
make your job even easier, there are handy command references for
NetWare (versions 3.x and 4.x), Personal NetWare, LAN-tastic, Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT.

The book follows a step-by-step approach to help you get going smoothly.

It begins by unveiling the basics Cabling, Network Interface Cards,
Topology, Hub, Network Operating Systems, and File Server the very least
you need to know about networking. However, if you want to skip any,
"The Least You Need To Know" section, at the end of each chapter, might
prove sufficient. (Although the author could have packed more
interesting information in each of them.)

To illustrate different end-user features, the book takes a parallel
approach for both DOS and Windows for Workgroups users. The most
frequently used NetWare features such as MAP, NLIST, FLAG, NDIR, NWUSER,
NETUSER, SALVAGE, and FILER have been discussed in detail with
appropriate illustrations. Chapters on network security, printer
sharing, communicating on a network (using Lotus cc:Mail), and NetWare
troubleshooting are written carefully, so that readers won't get
confused while applying them in real-life situations.

Finally, the author helps you build your own network from installing and
configuring network cards to setting up a peer-to-peer LAN using Windows
for Workgroups. You may never need to build one from scratch, but seeing
how it's done can also guide you through the tasks for connecting a new
computer to an existing network.

Although the book has a ctually nothing to do with NetWare
administrators, it is still highly recommended for novice NetWare users
who want to use common sense to stay connected.

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

You'd have a big head too if you were the newest addition to one of the
most successful fighting franchises in the video game industry. US-based
Sega (www.sega.com) has given `birth' to Virtua Fighter Kids (VFK) for
Sega Saturn. The mega-hit arcade game in Japan is a sequel (or
`pre-quel' biologically speaking) to Virtua Fighter 2, the best-selling
Sega Saturn game.

All 10 Virtua Fighter 2 characters are in `half-pint' proportions except
their heads which are 10 times normal size and designed as the child
version of each fighter. The result: 20 percent faster action with
crystal-clear facial expressions that add more emotion. VFK is a direct
translation to the 32-bit Sega Saturn video game console. And as Sega's
ST-V arcade board is compatible with the Saturn hardware, perfect
conversion is possible. The moves are the same as Virtua Fighter 2, but
the smaller body proportions of VFK characters give players an ability
to create new move.

The Options menu lets players chain together various moves and adjust
their timing. Complex combinations that previously required multiple
directional and action key strokes can be activated with one button. The
new Kid's mode lets players unfamiliar with the controls perform the
appropriate moves by pressing the buttons randomly perfect for younger
children or inexperienced players. Other new features include a short
instant replay during play, , a computer graphics opening movie that
shows each character in both traditional and `kids' sizes, and a reward
movie showing the Kids' characters private lives. The game costs $50.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: KODAK SELLS COPIER BUSINESS TO UK'S DANKA

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

With its corporate focus on the company's traditional photographic
business as well as new digital imaging markets, Eastman Kodak in
Rochester, New York, has sold its money-losing $1.8 billion-a-year
copier and printer business to UK-based Danka Business Systems for $684
million. The move comes as Kodak, which ranks as the world's second
largest supplier of high-speed copiers, has fallen further behind
industry leader Xerox while losing additional marketshare to competitors
such as Canon and Konica.

Under deal, Kodak will continue to manufacture and sustain its copier
line, while Danka, will sell and service the machines. Danka will also
take over some of Kodak's assets and operating liabilities, while Kodak
will retain $123 million in receivables stemming from long-term copier
leases in Britain and Canada. Danka officials said they plan to offer
jobs to the more than 10,000 Kodak copier sales workforce, including
some 4,000 employees in officers outside the United States.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: TOSHIBA TAKES A PAGE FROM SONY'S US HOME PC STRATEGY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Following in the footsteps of Sony, Toshiba announced its entry into the
US home PC market with its Infinia line that offer advanced multimedia,
and bear close resemblance to the company's other consumer electronics
products.

Like Sony, Toshiba's plans to slowly roll the PCs out into the US market
which has been stubbornly resistant to Japanese-made desktop PC. The
company will make only three models available initially, and sell them
through a handful of carefully selected retailers in key regional
markets. Unlike Sony, however, Toshiba already enjoys a leadership
position in the US notebook computer market. Tom Scott, head of
Toshiba's US PC operations, said, Toshiba hopes to rank as the fifth
largest PC vendor in the US by the end of 1997.

To entice users, Toshiba has built a number of button controls into the
Infinia system, most of them located on the monitor. These control
functions such as volume, base, tremble, and brightness. The Infinia
also doubles as a TV or radio. In those modes, the buttons change
functions to those of a TV.

The three models have Pentium processors, with varying RAM, disk drive
capacity, and a 28.8 kbps modem, are priced between $1,699 and $2,799. A
15" monitor with stereo speakers adds $449 to the price tag.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: TOSHIBA'S NEW DVD LASER CAN PUT 15 GB ON SINGLE SIDE
DISK

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

In another potential blow to the Sony-Philips digital video disk (DVD)
alliance, Toshiba has announced the availability of a blue-purple
semiconductor laser that allows for up to 15 GB of data to be stored on
a single-sided disk. By comparison, the red laser used in the
Sony/Philips DVD system stores a mere 5 GB on each of a two-sided disk.

Toshiba's laser generates a 417 nanometer wavelength at room
temperature, compared to the 650 nanometer wavelength of the red laser.

The blue-purple laser is based on a gallium-nitride compound. With a
capacity of 15 GB, the Toshiba disks would offer enough storage capacity
for full length movies with substantially less compression requirement.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: CIRRUS LOGIC LAUNCHES NEW CD-RECORDABLE/ERASABLE CHIPS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Cirrus Logic Inc (www.cirrus. com/) has introduced the industry's
fastest encoder/decoder chips for CD-ROM applications. These support
CD-Recordable/Erasable (CD-R/E) formats that allow the end-user to
record, erase and re-use the CD-ROM. Available in SCSI interface
(CL-CR3560) and ATAPI interface (CL-CR3460) versions, the encoders also
support the industry's fastest 18X read and 8X record disk speeds. The
new chips are fully compatible with all CD-writing methods. And also
support Sony-Philips CD-ROM, CD-I, and CD-DA (Digital Audio) formats,
for use with all implementations of CD technology. The chips are
equipped with a CD-ROM encoder/decoder, CIRC encoder, EFM modulator,
ATIP decoder, SCSI or ATAPI interface.

The CL-CR3560 has a single-ended SCSI interface with integrated 48 mA
bus drivers. The chip supports the SCSI-2 industry standard, making it
compatible with a wide variety of peripherals. The CR3560 is also
SCAM-compatible, conforming to the latest updates of the SCSI
specification. The CL-CR3460 is the ATAPI equivalent high-performance
CD-R/E encoder/decoder. The ATAPI interface permits the CD-ROM to share
the ATA bus of the host computer with existing ATA/IDE hard disk drives.

Both devices combine fast error correction and the capability to read
damaged disks on-the-fly to provide the industry's most advanced data
integrity protection.

NEWS WORLDWATCH: IBM & 15 BANKS TEAM UP ON E-BANKING

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Two years ago, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates said that today's banking
institutions were `dinosaurs' waiting to be overtaken by a new
electronic banking order where Microsoft would play a central role.

Gates has since regretted the statement, as the banking industry has
looked every which way since to keep him out.

Now 15 leading US banks have formed Integrion Financial Network an
alliance with IBM to support a new financial network that will provide a
broad range of electronic banking services to customers. And that too
without paying royalties to Microsoft, Intuit, or other e-banking
supplier. Integrion will enable bank customers to check their balances,
transfer money between accounts, pay bills, shop electronically on the
Internet, send e-mail messages to their bank, and even arrange for loans
on major electronic purchases. In the future, the network can be used to
trade securities, get stock quotes, and get access to their mutual
funds. Although only 15 banks have signed up, Integrion will be open to
any bank.

The move appears a setback to Gates' hopes for the banking community, as
outlined in a 1994 Fall Comdex video presentation, where Microsoft
envisioned people using Windows-controlled devices instead of cash,
credit or bank cards. In Gates' vision, computer users can establish
electronic credit accounts to shop both in cyberspace and in the real
world.

With Integrion, customers can shop on the Internet, and access their
accounts through their bank's Web site which can be directly accessed or
through services such as America Online and CompuServe. User can either
pay directly or click a "Financing" button at the vendor's Web site.

This connects the user to a bank on the Integrion network that
determines the customer's credit worthiness.

MULTITASKING WITH DOS: GENERATE A BACKGROUND WITH TINY DARTS SHOOTING ALL
OVER THE SCREEN

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

While today's operating systems usually  have multitasking built-in,
good old  DOS users too could  do with a bit of it. Hooks and TSR
programs can be used to provide some rudimentary multithreading even
with a normal DOS program.

Interrupt 8h is the timer interrupt and is called by the system 18.2
times a second (actually 91 times in 5 seconds). This is used to update
the system clock and perform other regular updates. This interrupt can
be captured and pointed to your own procedure, making sure it is called
several times a second. However, there is one disadvantage Int 8h is a
sensitive interrupt where delays can cause the machine to hang. The
procedures chained need to return the control very fast so as not to
interrupt the normal functioning of the system.

To get around these restrictions, Int 1Ch which is invoked by Int 8h
every time it is called can be used effectively. While this too is
called 18.2 times a second, it can be used quite safely without the
dangers involved with Int 8h. When chaining a procedure to Int 1Ch, keep
in mind that the procedure should be one that does something fast and
returns the control soon. For instance, a procedure that updates a clock
in the corner of a screen should not have a loop built into it, but
should rely on the fact that it is called repeatedly several times a
second. Every time it is invoked, it should get the current time and
display it before handling the control back.

To make things simple, here is a program (compilable in Turbo Pascal
6.00 and above) which demonstrates background operation using Int 1Ch.

The program generates a background akin to what programs like Scream
Tracker use, with tiny darts zipping all over the screen. While these
"movers" move around, the program can go on processing in the
foreground, interacting with the user normally.

Assuming fifteen movers are going to be around at any given point of
time, an array with details about each mover is maintained. Each mover
is determined by its X and Y coordinates on the screen, the character
that is used for the mover, the direction the mover is moving, its speed
setting and whether the mover is currently on the screen or not.

The array is initialised with a randomly chosen Y coordinate and an X
coordinate which describes either the extreme left or right corner. Care
is taken so that no two movers lie on the same row. The speed is a
random figure and the direction of movement is selected according to
which corner the mover starts off. If the mover lies on a position where
a character already exists, one can either choose to have it overwritten
or have it hidden giving the illusion of passing in front and behind the
character respectively setting the OnScr truth variable accordingly.

The procedure MoveIt is an interrupt procedure that is written to
replace the original Int 1Ch. The address of the real interrupt is
stored in the variable Int1C. MoveIt has a counter that keeps cycling
between 0 and 15. A mover's position is updated when the current value
of the timer is exactly divisible by the speed of the mover. This means
that the lower the speed setting, the more frequently the mover is
moved.

Every time MoveIt is called, it cycles through the data for all 15
movers making adjustments when necessary. When a mover hits the end of
the screen, it is pulled off and a new one is created. Once in a while,
the speed of a mover is changed while it is travelling across the
screen. When a new Y coordinate is being generated for a mover, one
needs to check whether another one already exists in the same row.

A problem with movers when the screen is being used for something is
that if a mover gets overwritten when it is on the screen, the next time
it moves, it blanks out the offending character because when the mover
was put on the screen, the position was blank. Again, if the screen is
scrolled, the data on where the movers were located will no longer be
valid, leaving lost movers all over the screen. While nothing can be
done about the second problem except for ensuring that the screen is not
scrolled, the first problem can be countered by creating a set of rows
on which movers should not appear. Any changes on the screen by the
foreground processing should be done only here.

The set nothere contains the rows on which movers should not appear. It
should be initialized to an empty set in the beginning before using it.

The sample program has the first two rows marked off limits for the
movers.

One of the problems with the default frequency of Int 1Ch is, it is not
frequent enough to provide very effective control over speed. The
solution is to boost the number of times the timer invokes Int 8h, which
in turn invokes Int 1Ch. The procedure FTimer, increases this speed, and
the STimer procedure returns this to normal. While this increases the
number of times the procedure MoveIt is called, it also has the side
effect of speeding up the system clock. To get rid of this, you can
write a replacement Int 8h which calls the real Int 8h only 18.2 times a
second, but calls your procedure every time the speeded up timer ticks.

The same technique can be used for other interrupts as well. For
example, Int 28h, the idle time interrupt is called whenever the system
is free and the computer is waiting for the user to do something. It can
be chained to kick in with a screen saver after a specified period of
inactivity. Int 24h, the DOS critical error interrupt can be chained to
install a proper error handler, while Int 23h, the critical break
handler can be hooked to install a custom Control-Break handler.

While these techniques can be used to implement some degree of
multithreading, DOS was never made for this. Extreme care should be
taken when implementing things like this so as to avoid potential
conflicts with other programs and TSRs which may use the same hooks.

FAXES FOR FREE: USE EMAIL TO SEND FAXES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

To the many wonders of the Internet, add another the  ability to send
free faxes to many parts of the world. This experiment started in 1993
to integrate e-mail and fax. Its now grown into a reliable and
full-fledged service that is used regularly by both individuals and
organizations. Since it can be accessed using e-mail, readers with
e-mail access to the Internet can send faxes.

Send e-mail to a special address incorporating the phone number of the
fax machine you are trying to reach instead of a fax. The e-mail address
format is remote-printer.1st_Address_ Line/2nd_Address_Line@ .iddd.tpc.int.

The "remote-printer" bit is required to generated an automatic cover
page. The Address Lines generate a "Please deliver this fax to:" message
on the cover page. When the cover page is created, underline characters
will be converted to spaces and backslash to a new line. Use the address
to specify the recipient's name/title and department, or any other
addressing information. The pound sign represents the fax number, and
this should include the country code, the area code, and the fax number.

Indian users should not use the `00' ISD prefix used. The entire number,
including the country code must be included even if you are sending a
fax within your own country. (For users in India of course this is moot,
since as of writing India is not accessible through this service.)
Suppose you want to fax the BBC World TV's News Editor whose fax number
is +44-181-5762782. Here `44' is the UK country code, `181' London's
code and 5762782 the fax number. You would send e-mail to
remote-printer. News_Editor/BBC_World_TV@441 815762782. iddd.tpc.int.

Similarly, if you wanted to fax Time magazine's Hong Kong office, you
would send e-mail to remote-printer.Hong_Kong_Office/Time_
Magazine@85225129790.iddd.tpc.int, where 852 is Hong Kong's code and
25129790 is the number.

The project depends on a number of "cells" available worldwide. A cell
is a remote-printing server, that has been set up to service a
particular geographical calling area. A fax sent to this server will be
redirected to the appropriate cell which then transmits it locally as a
fax. Since the fax has traveled mostly through the Internet, and not
over the telephone, its free (unless you pay to send e-mail). And since
your message has traveled as a fax only on the final leg of its journey,
it will have less data loss than a conventional fax.

Feedback

Once a fax is delivered, the sender receives a status report by e-mail
from the cell operator confirming delivery. If the fax could not be
delivered (the number is not a fax machine, or its is continuously busy,
or the machine is out of paper), the cell operator will inform you via
by e-mail, of its inability to deliver. Most cell operators try a number
of times to send a fax, informing you of the outcome of each attempt,
before they give up.

If you don't receive a report, it's possible that either your original
fax or the cell operator's confirmation message is delayed. It's as
reliable as e-mail, and delays do take place with e-mail too. Or your
fax could be waiting in a fax queue on a busy cell. However, usually you
will receive confirmation of a successful transmission within 15
minutes, but it could be as long as a day too. If you don't received any
acknowledgment even after 24 hours assume that something went wrong and
send the fax again.

AREAS SERVICED

As of writing, just three countries UK, Sweden and Hong Kong have
complete coverage. There is partial coverage of Australia, the US,
Canada, and parts of Europe. In the US, some major metros including New
York and San Francisco are covered.

Before sending faxes by e-mail, find out which areas are covered. A fax
sent to an area not covered generates an error message from the project
administrator. Coverage changes as new cells come on-line, and as
technical glitches occasionally take cells off-line, or when network
failures make them inaccessible.

To receive a list of countries covered, send blank e-mail to
tpccover@info. tpc.int for a list of service areas. The list is e-mailed
to you, and if you're a regular use update your listing every other
week.

FAXING GRAPHICS

This service is not limited to ASCII-based text. You can also send
PostScript file using a MIME-compliant mailer. (If you're not sure if
your mailer is MIME-compliant, check with its vendor, your system
administrator, or a knowledgeable friend.)

With PostScript you can send formatted text (including non-Roman fonts
such as Devanagiri) or complex images. You can even send your fancy
letterhead if you have a graphical format copy and a scanned version of
your signature.

To generate a PostScript file, select a PostScript printer driver in
your application and use the `print-to-file' option. This file should
always have a .PS extension. For the most reliable results, use basic
fonts such as Times New Roman. And if you want to spice things up then
select the print option that allows you to include font descriptions in
the PostScript file. This results in a huge file that can be
successfully converted to a fax by a cell which doesn't know about the
font you are using. A caveat: some e-mail providers restrict the size of
messages sent, as do Internet service Providers, and the destination
cell. Also some PostScript drivers create non-standard files. If
possible, use Apple's LaserWriter driver which works.

SETTING UP A CELL

The project's coverage depends wholly on cell operators individuals and
organizations worldwide who have established cells in their local areas.

Most operators participate as an Internet-community service as they earn
no profits. However, they are allowed to acknowledge a sponsor on the
cover page of every fax delivered and to use advertising revenue to
offset costs.

To join the project and establish your own cell you will need a permanent
connection to the Internet (as opposed to a dial-up connection) and some
basic hardware (a PC and a fax modem). The project will provide the
software. The coverage of your cell depends on you. Most cover an entire
area code so that every fax sent is a local call. Contact the project
administrator at tpcadmin@info.tpc.int for details.

A FAQ is available by mailing a blank message to tpcfaq@info.tpc.int.

Information on the project is available www.tpc.int. There's also a
mailing list for those interested. Join it by sending a message to
majordomo@aar net.edu.au. This message must have a body of a single line
subscribe tpc-rp

MAKING MUSIC ON THE PC

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

More about MIDI

In last month's article we covered  the fundamentals behind making music
on the PC. We also learnt b about MIDI composition and digital audio.

This month we'll take a  closer look at how you can use MIDI. But before
you can do something constructive, you will need a better idea of the
technology. And a demystifying of its associated jargon and concepts.

Connecting Things

MIDI (Musical Instruments Digital Interface) is a way for MIDI devices
to communicate with one other. A 5-pin DIN socket is used for MIDI and
is the gateway through which data passes. And if you don't know what is
a DIN, look at your PC's keyboard connector socket and plug. There are
three types of MIDI ports IN, OUT and THRU and a port on one device can
be connected to a MIDI port on another using a MIDI connector. This
looks like an ordinary DIN connector, but is better shielded. However,
you can also use a normal two ended DIN cable without problems.

Use a PC with a MIDI-compatible sound card as your primary MIDI device.

However, as most sound cards often don't have standard MIDI sockets, you
will need a MIDI adapter which is connected to the sound card's DB15
joystick socket. The DIN plugs at one end of the cable can be plugged
into other MIDI devices. When acquiring a MIDI adapter, its important to
ensure that it uses electronic components known as opto-isolators in it.

Some cheaper adapters do not use these, and may not work properly with
your sound card.

Keyboard To PC

We have two MIDI devices a keyboard controller and a PC with a sound
card. A typical keyboard such as the Roland PCM200 has a MIDI OUT port.

And the PC sound card has both MIDI IN and a MIDI OUT ports. If you
connect the MIDI OUT of the keyboard to the MIDI IN of the PC, the
keyboard can send MIDI data to the PC. The PC cannot send MIDI data to
the keyboard, since this particular keyboard only has an OUT port. The
PC can in turn send MIDI data out through the OUT to another MIDI
device, such as. another keyboard with a MIDI IN or another PC with a
MIDI IN. In short, the OUT port transmits data and IN port receives
data. But what about the THRU port.

If the PC has a THRU port, then any device connected to this port will
receive only MIDI data being received via the MIDI IN port. THRU ports
are a bypass for the raw MIDI data sent to a MIDI device. Most MIDI
devices, including PCs, can reconfigure the OUT to a THRU port. This
allows a keyboard to be connected to one PC that is in turn connected to
another PC, and the MIDI data flows through the first computer to the
second without being modified. But if the first PC has an OUT port
instead, MIDI data transmitted would originate from that PC.

In principle a network of MIDI devices can be daisy-chained (connected)
using the IN, OUT and THRU ports. And any MIDI data can be routed to any
device with the right port. However, data flow is one-way: from OUT to
IN or from THRU to IN.

The MIDI Data

Now that we've learn a bit about the hardware mechanics, lets look at
how the data is moved. Actually, for some reason, most people call MIDI
data messages, so we too shall do so from here onwards. Essentially,
there are two types system messages and channel messages.

System messages tell the MIDI device how to run itself, and are pretty
much like DOS or UNIX OS commands. They can tell the MIDI device to stop
or start playing a musical piece, or do a data-dump (dumping all from
one device to another). Channel messages describe to the MIDI device
details of notes being performed.

The MIDI specification assigns 16 channels (1-16) through which note
data is passed. Although you usually assign a channel per instrument,
you can also assign many instruments to a single channel. And if you're
really perverse many channels to an instrument.

Each channel is like a TV channel. The MIDI device connected and
receiving channel messages will only perform data in that channel if it
is set to receive it. Or to put it in MIDI-speak: if the channel numbers
match. For example, you can have a flute on Channel 2 with a piano on
Channel 3, but if A is receiving only on Channel 2 and B too is
receiving on Channel 3, then A will reproduce the flute and B the piano.

A common misconception is that MIDI connectors pipe audio. This is
untrue and they only carry the instructions for playing a sound. In
essence, if you set A to receive on channel 2 and B on channel 3, and
then send an instruction to play a flute on channels 2 and 3 through
MIDI, the flute sound generated is looked up separately. A's sound card
will transmit a flute sound and B's sound card too will mimic it. And if
A's card has good sound reproduction and B is low-quality, then you're
going to end up with something that's discordant, and not really music.

And speakers connected to B's card will only reproduce the low-fidelity
sound generated. They won't be able to play the great stuff coming from
A.

MIDI Composition And Sequencer

Now to the nitty-gritty's of how MIDI is used to make music. A sequencer
sends MIDI messages in the right sequence to MIDI devices to get them to
play their sounds. Sequencer tell the device to play drums on channel
10, bass guitar and double bass on channel 1, flute on channel 2 and
piano on channel 3. Sequencing is also known as MIDI composition, and a
suitable sequencer lets you compose music for an entire orchestra.

But how many kinds of sequencer are there. Although special, dedicated
hardware sequencer are available, there are also PC software based
ones. A hardware sequencer' main advantage is that they are a complete
portable package such as the Roland MV-30 (39cm x 31cm x 7.7cm) that
weighs 3 .46 kg. Marketed as a "studio production system," it can
control up to eight instruments on external MIDI devices.

But software sequencer are becoming more popular. Although available on
desktop machines, these were too bulk to carry to a concert. But
notebook PCs whose portability, affordability and capabilities are
beginning to make an impression, and the software option will eventually
edge out hardware sequencer.

Composing On The PC

The most popular PC software sequencer available are Cubase, Logic, and
Cakewalk. They are also very expensive, with the Pro versions costing
more than $200 apiece. While its possible to get earlier (and cheaper)
versions of abroad. I would recommend Logic and Cakewalk as earlier
versions of Cubase are notoriously buggy on the PC because they were
rather badly ported from the Mac. Logic and Cakewalk too have porting
bugs but are not as bad.

But for beginners, I would recommend PowerTracks Pro. This retails at
$29 and has enough features to keep you busy. And when you finally
outgrow it, it's cheap enough to not feel bad about moving on. It is
also the one sequencer we've never been able to crash. Version 4 (latest
as of writing) also allows one track of digital audio to be recorded
along with the sequencer.

The real problem with all the sequencer mentioned is that they are not
legally available in India. And if you can't buy them abroad, then all
you can use are pirated (and possibly) duplicate units. Are software
vendors in India listening.

But don't despair, there is a solution. As an example, let's walk
through Music Sculptor, a (rather dated) shareware sequencer, for you to
get a feel. Do remember that shareware is not free, and if you decide to
keep using this app, you should pay the author. Registration costs about
$30, but we for one would rather save up for PowerTracks Pro (which is a
lot better) instead. Music Sculptor 1.7 is available on the PCQ Winter
'96 CD-ROM.

To use Music Sculptor, you need a PC with a sound card and speakers,
running Win 3.x. You don't need a music keyboard (though if you have one
then use it) or a MIDI adapter (because if you are not using a music
keyboard, then the MIDI connection from the sequencer to the sound card
is emulated by the PC).

In Music Sculptor the top track-view window is a MIDI music editor.

However, more powerful sequencer have many different and useful ways to
edit music in the. These include Score-View editors that show notes in
musical score form for each track; Event-View editors which allow direct
handling of MIDI data; and Piano-Roll editors that use horizontal bars
corresponding to the pitch and assigning a length that corresponds to
the duration. (Piano-rolls were rolls of scrolling special paper with
punch marks used to play automated pianos. The computer version
resembles it mechanical ancestor and uses an electronic rather than
mechanical version, hence the name).

The bottom window is a piano keyboard, and you can use the mouse to play
it. Just click the mouse on a piano keys. And if you hear a familiar
sound you are in luck. But if you don't hear anything it's time to check
things. This is a familiar ritual for anyone who links together musical
devices and more often than not you wonder why is there no sound.

Check easy stuff like speaker connections: are they plugged in and
receiving power. Are the cables connect to the correct jacks. If all
seems well next check that your sound card drivers exist look in Program
Manager's Main window's Control Panel applet under Sound. If you can't
see any drivers then they may have not been installed and check the
card's manuals and software. If your card software includes a mixer for
the various outputs and inputs, check that the MIDI output is switched
on and that the master volume is set on maximum. And if in doubt, set
all outputs on full and adjust later. Also check that the output from
the sequencer is set to the sound card.

Once everything is set, touch piano keyboard with the mouse and
generally mess around. Scroll up and down the keyboard using the scroll
bar at the bottom, to see what are the highest and lowest notes you can
sound. And drag the mouse across the keyboard to hear a glissando.

Sound Up, Let's Party

In Pro recording studios, you usually start with a rhythm track. And we
shall too. If your sound card driver supports the General MIDI standard,
which it should if it's MIDI compatible, then the default assignment
of the instruments on channel 10 will be drums of some kind. Move the
mouse pointer to the channel (ch) button for track 1, then click and
select channel 10. (Some sound cards may use channel 16 instead). You
also need to enable the track 1's recording mode by clicking its "Rec"
button. Try playing some of the piano keys you should get a variety of
sounds from bass drums to toms, hi-hats and cymbals.

To lay the drum track in, use the metronome facility to keep time. This
can be toggled from the Settings menu. Now, press the record button. You
will hear the metronome clicking. Listening to the metronome, use the
mouse to hit the drums at the right points in time. As the measures go
by, you will see the track grow. You only need to put the track in right
over one bar (or measure as defined in Music Sculptor) at a time, and
stop (by pressing the stop button) whenever you like.

It doesn't matter if the other measures are wrong, because you can
select the wrong ones with the mouse and delete them. Similarly, you can
select the correct measures and paste them in wherever you like in the
sequence to build a perfect drum track bit by bit. And to play click the
Play button.

Next, lay down a bass track on track 2. To select the right bass, click
the instruments column of track 2 and select from the collection of
General MIDI instruments. Record this track while playing the drum track
(with Play mode enabled) as backing to help you keep time.

You similarly can lay down other instruments on the remaining tracks.

There are 16-track and 24-track studios. Music Sculptor is like a
99-track virtual studio. But the number of channels remains 16, as in
MIDI.

Going Down The Road

Keying in your sequences using the mouse will soon become quite tedious.
It's also harder to make your music expressive. And if this is the case,
then its time to invest in a better MIDI controller. Usually this is a
dumb MIDI keyboard (dumb because it has no built-in voices, like normal
consumer keyboards). It does not need to be a keyboard and can be a
guitar (where each string is assigned a MIDI channel), or a wind
instrument like a saxophone (in which case the pressure with which you
play becomes very important MIDI data). Even tap-dancing shoes have been
used as MIDI controllers. But this is not as odd as using your mouse as
a MIDI controller device, though not connected to the sound card's MIDI
port like a normal controller.

A decent MIDI controller makes it easier to be more expressive. The
Roland PCM200 has velocity-sensitive keys and a pitch bending stick.

This makes quite a difference, and lets you record a sequencer track
which doesn't sound hopelessly mechanical. Another sound investment is a
better sequencing software as Music Sculptor, though easy to use, it is
really dated. If you want more control, you'll have to buy one of the
other sequencer mentioned. These will not only give you better track
editing, but also allow you to automatically correct the timing of the
notes (quantization) and do data dumps.

If you find that your sound card's output is poor, get a professional
sound module MIDI devices that play sounds stored on wavetables like the
sound card, but better. And as you feel the need, add more equipment to
the system. If its MIDI-compatible then connect it to your MIDI network
and do interesting things in combination with the other devices. Being
inventive and using your imagination goes a long way in a MIDI set up,
and is really the most important ingredient for MIDI composition.

Music technology is changing, and MIDI is no exception. The best way to
find out more is to subscribe to magazines such as Sound On Sound or
Future Music. You can also subscribe to a music makers' mailing list on
the Internet. A really useful reference is What's MIDI, available for
7.50 (cheque or postal order, payable to Nexus Media Ltd.), from Best
Sellers, Making Music, 50 Doughty Street, London W1N 2NG, UK.

The concluding part of this opus shall cover samplers and digital audio.
Meanwhile, here's a teaser about MIDI and digital audio to get you in
the mood: If you have a multimedia system, listen to the IKE8.WAV
(\Sharewar\ Music, PCQ Summer '96 CD-ROM). It's my band playing (with me
singing). See if you can figure out which of the instruments were
generated from MIDI sequencing, and which were real.

PAINTSHOP PRO 4: UPDATED FEATURES GIVE PSP COMMERCIAL FEATURES AT A
SHAREWARE PRICE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

PaintShop Pro 4 now brings a professional paint app to your desktop, at
the price of share-ware. And the features that put this app way ahead
of comparable shareware bitmap editors include support for full
masking, 21 image filters, 11 deformation utilities, options for
customizing your own filters, plus support for third party Adobe- or
Aldus-compatible plug-ins filters.

Besides supporting standard functions available in bitmap editors,
PaintShop Pro 4 has new special effects such as Hotwaxing, Gradient
Effects, Buttonize, and Drop Shadow. Using some of these effects is more
for fun than actual use. And Web designers, multimedia enthusiasts and
those who need to create presentations will appreciate some of included
features.

Buttonize is used to convert any graphic into a 3D button that can be
saved as a transparent GIF. These can later be used in Web pages or a
variety of multimedia applications. And Drop Shadow lets you create
raised text effects.

PSP 4's interface is far more streamlined than its predecessors, and the
filters are faster. And with drag-and-drop enabled, to open a graphic
files just drag it onto the PaintShop window or icon. This feature is
also available for multiple files too.

This version's speed too is amazing, with a typical filter like Emboss
being applied over a 1 MB file in seconds. It also incorporates some 29
paper textures mimicking a variety of surfaces. There are lots of minor
changes (Ctrl+Shift+F for full screen preview instead of Shift+F) that
will take existing users some time to get used to.

Screen capture has been enhanced, and you can now capture multiple
screens at one go. And this process can be triggered with the right
mouse button. Support for TWAIN-compatible scanners is also included.

All common bitmap and vector file formats including PCX, CDR, CGM, BMP,
GIF, and PhotoCD are supported. PSD (Photoshop) image support is also
built in, but PSP 4 can't read multiple layered images. It also failed
to open some .CDR files.

This is far more powerful than comparable shareware bitmap editors. And
if you perhaps miss some features, such as support for objects and
unlimited undo, available in other non-shareware, professional bitmap
editors, remember this one came free. And when registered is still
cheaper.

Paint Shop Pro 4 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. Shareware from JASC
Software Inc, Eden Prairie, MN (www.jasc.com). Registration $69 ($23
upgrade).

The new version has several exciting features including image filters,
deformation utilities, and support for third party plug-ins such as
Kai's Power Tools and Andromeda Filters. Also creates transparent GIFs
for use with Webpages and multimedia applications.

LOMEGA ZIP DRIVE: AN EFFICIENT, FORDABLE DRIVE FOR 100 MB "FLOPPIES"

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Storage remains a problem, and you can either store on tape, diskette, or
CD-ROM each with its own problems and limitations. Or you could get a
ZIP drive that uses a proprietary format disk a little bigger than a
3.5" floppy and stores up to 100 MB of randomly accessible data. And the
drive fits into most briefcases with the greatest of ease.

Our review unit was a parallel port version. SCSI versions too are
available. Strangely enough, the target PC must have a SCSI card
installed, which is still uncommon (unless it's a Mac where this is
standard). A Mac version is also available.

The drive is encased in a high impact resistant plastic colored an
aesthetic, easily recognizable blue. And can be stored vertically or
horizontally. There are two LEDs green power and orange for drive
access. The drive was powered by a surprisingly big power supply that
worked only at 220 volts units sold in the US and elsewhere are
dual-voltage, and much smaller. Since the drive is meant to be portable,
this was a strange decision from the vendor. And although the
documentation stated that the smaller, dual voltage power supply was
available separately if required, the vendor could not supply it.

There's a short, stubby cable with clearly marked 25-pin connectors at
both ends. And a quick check with a multi-meter showed it as an ordinary
25-to-25 pin cable, with every pin connected to the corresponding one at
the other end. Iomega warns that while it is indeed a straight-through
cable, the length and quality are important. We tried using an
identically configured serial cable that failed to work probably because
this was almost three times the length of the ZIP drive's cable.

The drive comes with two 3.5" diskettes one for DOS and Windows 3.x, and
one for Windows 95 that contain the driver's drivers. There was also a
single ZIP disk labelled "Tools". Installing all the drivers was quick
and easy. The setup program scans all ports, detects the drive, copies
the driver software into the right place on the hard disk, and then
enables the drive by assigning it the next available drive letter. You
don't even have to reboot. The second option is better for those who
carry the drive around. Just run GUEST or GUEST95 to detect the drive,
assign a drive letter and move out of the way all in about 10 seconds.

In Win95 we clicked on "My Computer" and sure enough there was a new
icon for the ZIP drive, complete with drive letter. Clicking that got an
error message. Sometimes one misses the obvious two red-faced reviewers
inserted the supplied ZIP disk into the drive and chose "retry". Now we
got the disks contents, just as off a hard disk or floppy. The drive's
Properties page indicated that the disk supplied was almost full, with a
mere 20 MB free.

This disk contains various drive utilities, and their Mac version. Even
more disconcerting was that the disk was write protected as we were
unable to copy any files to it. And the manual, while useful for the
physical installation, was silent about this aspect. The README file did
mention that the Installation program would erase the Mac stuff and make
the drive writable, but we used the GUEST app instead. According to
Iomega's Web site, run RECLAIM located in the SCSI subdirectory of the
Tools disk under DOS. That freed some 37 MB of space. Interestingly, the
ZIP disks have no write-protect tab. This is done through software, and
you can assign a password to the disk for more safety.

Speed Tests

Our disk now had 70 MB free, and we started copying small 100-200K
files, then a few 1 MB sized ones, finally a 50 MB monster. It soon
became clear that the ZIP drive is no speed demon the average was about
2 MB per minute faster than a floppy drive, but still with a sense of
disappointment. We though this was caused by the Guest app, so we now
went for a full install. And at the end a panel popped up saying that a
supplied program could speed-up the disk, but warned about possible
machine lockup if the parallel port wasn't up to spec. It did, and the
README said this option was only available for bi-directional parallel
port. While the test PC's parallel port was such a port, the BIOS was
set to compatibility (unidirectional) mode. This was changed, the PC
rebooted, and another test showed the transfer rate had risen to slightly
more than 5 MB per minute. We also noticed that Win 95 was now buffering
writes and releasing up the machine much faster and there was heavy ZIP
drive activity for quite a while after Windows returned control to our
application.

Wishes And Work Arounds

Among the things really missed is an ability to quickly find how much
space remains. With conventional drives, clicking the icon in Win95
gives an instant report. However, IOMEGA has thoughtfully provided a
work around. An option (right-clicking the drive) temporarily marks it
as non-removable. Win 95 now treated the ZIP drive as a hard disk and
correctly reported the disk space. This also solved another problem.

While installing an e-mail program on the ZIP, the installer refused to
install on a non-removable drive. The work-around solved that problem
too. While the drive is marked non-removable, you can't eject the disk,
but the eject button remembers your attempts and as soon as you revert
the settings, the disk ejects.

The ZIP drive comes with a comprehensive set of disk management
utilities. Of these utilities, some pop-up when your right click on the
ZIP drive icon. And include copy, format, write protect and eject disk,
as well as temporarily mark as a non-removable. However, we were unable
to find a cataloging app advertised as part of the software even the
accompanying demo-cum-ad mentioned FINDIT which apparently had not been
shipped. We later found that the Win 95 versions was not yet ready, and
had to download these later from the company's web site
(www.iomega.com). These added a catalog of the disk's contents, and a
new one-step backup and restore option that is fast and very convenient.

The backup software works in the background and ejects the filled up
disk as a signal to replace it with a blank one.

FINDIT was very fast, but far from convenient. It allows you to quickly
catalog and locate files, but you can't launch files or copy them. You
need to first start Explorer, insert the disk indicated by FINDIT, and
navigate to the correct directory. A shortcut is to press Ctrl-Escape,
select "Run Explorer z:\yourpath\" (or whatever the drive and path of
your target is).

Zipping On Price

The ZIP's international price is $200 and $15 for the disks.

Unfortunately, the local prices are a bit higher, yet still quite
affordable. At around Rs 16,000 for the drive and Rs 1,500 per disk,
this is the cheapest portable direct-access storage you can buy. We hope
price crash, sooner rather than later as they become more popular. But
watch out for fake disks. So far disks are being made only by Iomega but
rumour has it that they may soon be made by other floppy disk
manufacturers.

Overall the ZIP drive and disks have been so useful that we wonders
where they were all this time. As for reliability, the ZIP disks appear
extremely reliable. We haven't had them long enough to know when and if
they will start giving trouble with the oldest ZIP disk dating from June
1996. Iomega claims that the disks are very reliable and have survived
all their field tests.

Many manufacturers have decided that rather than shipping machines with
5" drives, the standard 3.5" drives will now be accompanied with Zip
drives. Iomega also makes a version that fits nicely into the bay next
to the normal floppy drive. But don't put them in your back pocket.

They're still too fragile for that.

LEXMARK OPTRA E: A ULTRA-COMPACT, LOW-COST, 600 DPI LASER PRINTER FOR
PERSONAL USE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Optra E lists among the smallest laser printers available today. It's
taller than most other models, yet fits snugly into a corner on your
desk. Because of its compact design, paper travels along a U-shaped
path, going in face up and coming out face down. Although we anticipated
frequent paper jams and curled-up pages, the paper jammed just once. And
that too when taking the last few sheets in the stack.

Optra E ships with drivers for DOS and Windows, MarkVision a printer
management tool. This (if you use a bi-directional interface) keeps you
informed of the printer's status. For instance, if the printer cover is
open, an icon of the printer with its cover open glows red. And can also
give audio prompts if your system has sound capabilities. The printer,
however does not ship with a bi-directional cable.

We had trouble getting Optra E up and running. One of its Windows driver
library files was corrupted and we had to acquire a fresh set from the
vendor. Then when we powered on the printer, the Press Button LED kept
flashing and issuing a print command would hang the system. Searching
the manuals both paper and online were of little help, as there was no
mention of what error this indicated.

A call to the vendor revealed that a front panel reset was needed to
clear the buffer. This too was not easy. According to the manual, to
reset you need to keep the operator button pressed for a long time. But
that didn't work and we managed a reset only after powering on the
printer while keeping the button pressed. Once we had figured this out,
there were no probems.

We tested the Optra E on our standard test bench a Pentium/100 MHz with
16 MB RAM running Windows 3.11. Text prints were sharp and clear, and
selecting PQET (Print Quality Enhancement Technology) smoothened the
slight edges in larger fonts. At 300 dpi (standard mode), the Optra E
printed the first sheet in 25 seconds average, not much off its rated 19
seconds for the first page. The average speed at 300 dpi came to
approximately 4 ppm (manuals give this as 6 ppm).

For a full-page graphic in 300 dpi, the Optra E took 171 seconds. That's
very slow compared to the HP LaserJet 5P (a 600dpi laser printer tested
on the same test bench) which managed it in 26 seconds at 300 dpi, and
56 seconds at 600 dpi. While printing at 600 dpi, the Optra E took an
unbelievable 21 minutes to tackle the full page graphic and the print
quality was worse than the 300dpi output. And after printing the page,
it gave a complex page error. Going by the manual, this indicates that
you need to upgrade the printer's memory. The Optra E ships with 1 MB of
memory which is sufficient for text printing. For graphics, get a memory
upgrade.

It's a reasonably priced laser printer, with lots of features that well
performs under 300 dpi. But it's not the serious graphics user's cup of
tea.

PRODUCT     : Lexmark Optra E

TYPE        : True 600dpi monochrome laser printer

FEATURES    : MarkVision printer management utility, 26 scalable fonts,
              Enhanced PCL5 emulation, PQET enhancement, Quick Print +
              and Toner Saver modes, RAMSmart advanced memory management
              utility, 1 year warranty

SUMMARY     : A light-weight and compact laser printer that gives good
              performance under 300 dpi but needs a memory upgrade for
              600dpi graphics.

PRICE       : Rs 34,095 (Toner cartridge: Rs 3,570; Photo Conductor Unit: Rs

LEXMARK COLOR JETPRINTER 1020: GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The 1020 is shaped differently from its contemporaries. It has a curved
front panel that flips opens to become the paper out tray. There are
three buttons and two indicator lights, but most printer management
functions are carried out by the bundled software. The power cable is a
"UK-type" three pin plug, with flat pins. And needs an adapter when used
in India. Or you will have to get a power cable that fits Indian power
sockets. You will also need to buy a Bitronics cable, as one is not
provided with the printer.

For a printer this inexpensive, the printer management software that
accompany the driver is among most comprehensive ones that we have
seen. Installing the drivers is simple and straight forward. The
software undertakes tasks that include cleaning and properly aligning
the print cartridge, setting print options such as paper type and size,
and the brightness and contrast of the colors in the print out. It also
has voice alerts. Also installed is an elaborate on-line help file.

There is no other printed documentation, but for an airline ticket-like
installation guide.

This printer can be bought according to the user's specification. That
is if you know what you want. The options are with monochrome
cartridge, or with Color cartridge and CorelDRAW 3.0, or with color
and monochrome cartridges, and all at different prices.

At the price of the Jetprinter, we did not expect professional quality
output. Yet, were pleasantly surprised by the results. The color
cartridge prints black by combining Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. Its not
true black, but passes muster. In our first tests with the color
cartridge, the Jetprinter's performance was good when printing solid
colors, but was way off the mark while printing gradients and
photographs. Apparently, some of the installed cartridge's
ink nozzles were not firing. The vendor replaced the cartridge, and after
a thorough cleaning, the new one gave real good printouts.

On our test machine P100/16 MB running Win 3.1 the Jetprinter gave
speeds of about a page per minute in normal mode for monochrome text,
which makes it slightly faster than the HP DJ 200. A full page color
graphic took 3:20 minutes to print.

Included with the printer is a CD-ROM containing CorelDRAW 3.0, 1,000
clipart images and 100 True Type fonts. Version 3.0 is pretty old for
CorelDRAW. And the manuals need to be purchased separately, using a form
inside the CD-ROM. Its too not clear if this option is available for
India.

All said and done, the Jetprinter 1020 is an affordable low-end inkjet,
that gives good quality output in both color and monochrome.

PRODUCT     : Lexmark Color Jetprinter 1020

FEATURES    : 330x300 dpi low-cost inkjet (600x300 dpi airbrush mode).
              Bundled CorelDRAW 3.0 (with color option)

PRICE       : Rs 9,095 (monochrome only); Rs 10,095 (color cartridge,
              CorelDRAW 3.0). Rs 1,040 (monochrome cartridge 1000 pages);
              Rs 1,340 (color cartridge 200 pages)

SUMMARY     : Gives good quality in monochrome and color modes. Bundled
              management software features several options and provides
              for extensive control. Voice enabled.

PERSONAL RESOURCES PLANNER: AN INFORMATION MANAGER WITH FA FEATURES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Personal Resource Planner (PRP) is a true-blue personal information
manager (PIM). Apart from managing contacts and appointments, it helps
you track your personal data, accounts, portfolio and projects. We
looked at the demo version of PRP. This is fully functional and only
restricts the number of entries. Installation is quick and creates a
program group for the software

The graphic interface, though not as slick as Lotus Organiser, is nice
and friendly. There is, however, a small mix-up in the Accounts module.

The Accounts icon should be dimmed when within this module, but
surprisingly, if you click it here you go to PRP's Diary section.

The Accounts option is more a mini-FA package, that lets you create and
maintain an accounts master. You can enter daily expenses in a
transaction file, and periodically consolidate your accounts. Options
for printing vouchers, generating and printing ledgers, trial balance
and P/L statements complete the job.

The Valuables section lets you track asset details such as purchase
date, amount, and mode of payment. You can also maintain records for
several owners, and enter details under different categories and
locations. And assign passwords to each module.

The program lets you store contact information (including name, address,
and telephone number) in the CardFile database. The data file structure
is customizable, and you can create multiple files. You begin by
specifying the database fields. Changing and deleting fields is easy.

And you can sort and index files. Cards can be categorized as `private'
and `public'. You can also export data into FoxPro 2.5 and dBASE IV and
vice versa. However, PRP doesn't support files from other popular PIMs.

Using the CardFile, you can also fix appointments (including multiple
day events and recurring tasks). There's also an auto-dialer for phone
calls that maintains a log of calls made. Call logs, as well as other
handy to-do lists and schedules can be printed. Tasks in to-do list can
be assigned different priorities. Text search options are included in
to-do lists, appointments, contacts and address books. The calendar
offers weekly, monthly and annual views. And the built-in notepad
appears adequate enough.

The Diary records important personal information such as the numbers for
your bank account, insurance policy, and vehicle license. It also has
separate sub-menus for medical, travel, credit cards and other
expenditure-related data.

The Portfolio module is exhaustive, and allows creation and maintenance
of company masters (with their financial, bonus, dividend and closure
history). The Report options includes valuation, dividend, and
sale/purchase. The Utility menu has depreciation, rate of interest and
value calculators. Unfortunately, the Help files were not included in
the demo reviewed.

PRP also includes a full-featured Project Management module complete
with calculation of cost per function point and per day output, and
generation of activity and resource-wise reports. Plus, it also included
trimmings such as conversion tables, international currency information,
a world clock and startup reminders.

In fact, except for e-mail support and group scheduling, Personal
Resources Planner has all features essential in a PIM. And would be a
useful application to manage your time.

PRODUCT   : Personal Resources Planner (Demo version) for Windows.

PRICE     : Rs 3,699 (Introductory offer valid till December 1996)
SUMMARY   : A handy tool for managing resources and increasing
            productivity. Has a calendar, to-do lists, appointments
            and other time management tools. Also a CardFile for contact
            management and a Diary for personal data. Modules for managing
            portfolio, valuables, accounts and projects.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: HOW HELPFUL ARE HELP DESKS?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

India has never been known for after sales support or service be it from
public utilities or computer vendors. And e-mail, which falls somewhere
in between, is no exception. The story (and service) is more or less
identical, whether its public sector VSNL which has been strongly
criticized or private service providers who are expected to be better,
yet who too are the same.

Usually, when you call the Help Desk in an emergency this in itself an
indicator that something has gone wrong you are fully justified in
expecting an immediate solution to your problems. Instead, the assigned
telephone numbers are either busy or go unanswered. And when they are
answered, more often than not no technical staff is available to
properly respond to your queries. Or to fix the problem.

In the course of this review, our experiences with the various service
providers did not impress us. (And remember as PCQ Labs reviewers, we
were in a sense handicapped, as we invariably had to disclose our e-mail
addresses and identities when calling the various help desks).

Incidentally, almost all our calls were related to problems we actually
faced, including non-working software, nodes that refused to respond,
junk being attached to messages, and so on.

aXcess began the cycle by not giving their front-end software in Delhi.

And what was finally delivered did not have a single installable module.

Getting connected to their help desk was virtually impossible (in Delhi)
during the day.

Sprint RPG claims to operate a 24-hour help desk in Delhi. Yet when we
called up at night, the telephone rang unanswered. However, during
working hours things were better.

Datapro had several problems while installing their software on our test
machine in Delhi. And could successfully complete it only after multiple
attempts. And then they gave up trying to (fruitlessly) install
value-added additions because of inherent bugs in the software.

Global's help desk was initially very difficult to get through to. They
subsequently set up a 24-hour help desk in Delhi, which despite its name
apparently does not function after office hours (presumably 9-to-5).

Wipro BT help desk was a waste of time. They were unable to help set
things right most of the time because "no one was available."
In comparison, and despite criticism, VSNL's help desk seems a much more
organized operation. Particularly when you begin with low expectations,
and are willing to wait while they connect you.

where the message has come from, whether it's a message delivery report,
or a message with an attachment. And all details are specified including
the date, time of delivery, status, subject, and its origin.

Mail sent can be assigned different priorities, importance, and
sensitivity levels. They can be directly typed in or sent as an
attachment. You can also create an address book where each entry has an
alias.

Mails for despatch is stored in the outgoing mail folder, and whenever
you connect to the message store, it will be transmitted. Automatic
connection to the message store occurs as soon as you log in. One
problem encountered with this pack age was that in most of the mail we
sent, an extra part was created by the software. Sometimes this add-on
was sent as an attachment.

At Delhi and Bangalore, we were able to connect to the node on the first
try, or at worst, on the second. However, connects in Mumbai were bad
with most requiring five or more tries.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: VSNL GIAS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

GIAS offers two types of accounts shell and TCP/IP. E-mail is available
in both through a shell account. As GIAS is essentially an Internet
service, in this review we have considered only the shell account. And
more specifically only its e-mail section.

GIAS uses a vanilla interface with no special software, and you can any
standard communications app to connect. The account is customisable in
the sense that you can use specialised third party app such as Eudora,
or browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer if you choose the TCP/IP
account, to simplify sending and receiving mail.

On the whole we found the GIAS shell account a little tough to use. For
one thing, other packages had easy menu-driven options for uploading and
downloading files for attachments, and for creating messages offline.

And VSNL has disabled the GIAS menu options for upload and download.

Selecting upload gives a message asking you to go to the restricted UNIX
prompt and use rz for uploads. However, if you do so and start the
upload process using your comms app (we used Telix) it transmits for a
while before crashing. To upload files you need to use the additional
switch -be (rz -be <filename>).

Similarly, the download option tells you to use sz, but to download your
mail in one go we had to use additional switches again (sz -e -l 1024 -L
1024 <filename>) to get mail and attachments together. And attachments
are MIME encoded, so you need a program such as XFERPRO (PCQ Summer '96
CD-ROM) to convert them into a readable format. Alternately you can save
attachments to your local directory on VSNL server, and then download
them separately.

You can also read your mail online in PINE, the shell account's e-mail
package with a built-in address book. However, PINE doesn't let you
queue messages to send them later. You must send, cancel or postpone.

You can also upload ASCII text directly into PINE which works for short
messages. However, when we tried uploading a UUENCODED attachment, the
system went into an infinite loop and eventually disconnected after more
than five minutes of endless screen scrolling.

Connecting is comparatively difficult with GIAS. At all stations, we had
to keep re-dialling to get connected. This happened on almost all
attempts.

On the other hand, VSNL GIAS doesn't charge you per message or on a
volume basis a powerful attraction especially if you are sending and
receiving a lot of mail. And more importantly, you get Internet
access something none of the other services reviewed can offer today.

There's only a one-time (renewable) connect charge for every 500 hours
of use.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: SPRINT RPG

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The SprintMail software is by far the most option-filled e-mail app. It
seems to have a button for just about any task. And apart from the
normal send and receive mail options, there's also an interactive option
that allows you to log on to the node and work online. You can also join
several entailment forums available on SprintMail. These range from
astrological predictions to technical discussions.

All tasks from message composition through address book management to
interacting with the host are performed by clicking icons on the
toolbar. However as is usual with such an impressive number of buttons,
initially it can be quite confusing to decide which one does what. Tool
tips or an Icon explanation screen would definitely add to the ease of
use.

There's also an option to set up and perform scheduled operations. This
allows you to send mail at a preset time, or check for mail.

Managing address books too is simple. There is a range of templates that
convert the address into Sprint's format. When SprintMail first started
in India, the Internet template would not work properly, as it had not
been customized to Indian addressing. But this bug has since been fixed,
and Internet addressing too is supported by the templates.

Connecting to Sprint was also easy, with at worst, a second try required.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: GLOBAL MAIL

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

This is an easy-to-use e-mail app. You read your mail and create new
mail offline. Once everything is ready, you just connect to the node.

Mail received is downloaded and whatever you have ready in your Outbox
is uploaded for onward transmission. And once connected, the software
graphically displays messages being retrieved.

All the retrieved mail is automatically stored in the local folder. A
really nice thing about this package is that unread mail has a sealed
envelope icon and mail read has an open letter icon. This helps you
distinguish between new messages and old ones. Activities such as
connecting to the node and sending and receiving mail have been
simplified. And can be done through one click of your mouse.

However, creating Address Books is really painful as there are no
templates. If you want to enter an Internet e-mail address, instead of
using the common @ symbol you have to enter `(a)'. The window to make
this entry is quite confusing and consists of several tabs that ask just
about everything but the way to grandma's house. The main tab lets you
fill in details such as your given name, surname, common name, and
primary routing details. Then there's a network tab where you enter the
domain defined attributes and other network details needed for Internet
addresses. There's also a postal tab to enter details such as a person's
postal address and telephone numbers. There's the Others tab to enter
the alias name. And finally there's the X.500 tab with several of its
own queries. It would have been much simpler if templates had been
provided, as in Sprint mail.

A really helpful feature about this app is that if there's pending mail
in the Sent Mail folder, the software prompts you on whether to send it
or not whenever you exit. Sending or receiving attachments is easy
between two ISOPRO users. We sent a ZIPfile between two ISOPRO hosts,
and between an ISOPRO and another e-mail package. Between the former,
the attachment format was recognized, but in the latter the file changed
to BIN format. This necessitated a call to the Help Desk for a solution.

Just save the BIN attachment as a ZIP file and then access it.

Connecting to Global was not a problem. We were able to get through on
the first try itself on most occasions. And the worst case was five
tries that happened twice at Bangalore in the afternoon.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: DATAPRO XEE-MAIL 96

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Xee-MAIL 96 user agent is an easy-to-use app whose other options
besides e-mail include printing, managing address books, access
permissions, administration, tools, and a neatly compiled help file.

During installation, the software by default creates a System
Administrator (Sysadmin). This user has the rights to add five more
users and define their access rights.

Creating e-mail is the same as with other Windows-based e-mail apps. You
create new mail by typing in a message, or by using cut-or
copy-and-paste from other messages or text documents, and by using
attachments. One nice feature about the latter is that you don't have to
specifically invoke the address book. Just click the To: tab, and the
address book displays automatically. Next double click on the
recipient's alias and the address is entered in the To: field. However,
Xee-MAIL does have a strange way of connecting to the node. After
preparing your messages, you have to restart in DOS to dial-in. For a
Windows app, its really strange that you need DOS for such simple tasks.

One area where we faced problems was while using mailing lists. The
package refused to queue a mailing list, and this remained consistent,
regardless of whether the mailing list consisted of a single address or
of 20 addresses. We even checked if the Sysadmin had imposed any such
restrictions on the user, but found none. And even the Sysadmin was
unable to queue the mailing list for dispatch.

Creating an address book is simple. There are several templates for
adding a new e-mail address. There are also additional features such as
authorizing access to someone else to use your account while you are
away and encoding a message for privacy.

Connecting to Datapro's nodes was fairly easy at all locations. We were
usually able to connect in three tries. And in the worst case, it took
eight attempts to get through at 11:00 AM in Delhi. But in Bangalore we
faced a problem. After a full day of testing, our mail box the next day
was full of 172 undelivered messages. Many of these were duplicates, and
others had been sent and received by recipient. However this problem
occurred only once.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: AXCESS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

aXcess Electronic Messaging is a DOS based e-mail service. And it's
initial splash screen is the only graphical element. aXcess gives you
the option of using either their software, or any standard
communications app (such as Telix) to upload and receive mail.

With aXcess you can prepare messages both on and offline. However,
features such as the Address book and Alias lists can only be created
and accessed while online. Therefore even though you create messages
offline you still have to remember the e-mail address or at the very
least the recipient's e-mail alias (nickname for the full address).

Using this method, an address such as labsd.pcq@axcess.net.in becomes
`labsdelhi' which is easier to remember. The problem with remembering
multiple aliases or addresses is mitigated a bit by Alias lists that
allow to you club e-mail addresses under an easy to remember word such
as `Friends'.

Once you dial in, aXcess allows you to organize your mail by moving and
copying messages between folders. You can view or create messages using
the built-in editor which looks a lot like WordStar 4. And the pull-down
menus are quite straightforward. But using the e-mail software would
have much easier with dialog boxes instead of the nested sub-menus
approach used. You have to select `Move' to choose the message to move,
then select the target folder to move to, and finally press <Esc> to
back out.

One problem we faced with aXcess was that you can't address a message to
more than seven people in the To list. And the same restriction also
applies to Alias lists. To make it harder, the system has few prompts
and messages. There is no way of knowing when you are done with the
current chore. And you end up staring at the screen wondering what's
going on. A simple dialog box mentioning that the task is completed
would be nice.

aXcess also gives you access to Business India's database of the Stock
Market and Foreign Exchange rates. But when we tried to check this, we
got an error message that we weren't registered for this service.

At all test locations, we had problems connecting to the aXcess nodes.

E-MAIL SERVICES IN INDIA: PCQ LABS REVIEWS FIVE MAJOR E-MAIL PROVIDERS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

For this review, PCQ Labs setup test accounts at Bangalore, Delhi and
Mumbai. Vendors were also requested to activate a roaming account at
Pune. Vendors were allowed to install the necessary software on our test
machine, and configure it. The only difference was VSNL GIAS, where we
used Telix a popular shareware app as no specialized software was
provided. Once the software was properly set up, the tests began on an
`as-is where-is' basis. We were unable to review VSNL's GEMS.400
service, as test accounts were only available at two locations Delhi and
Mumbai.

E-mail usage can broadly be classified into two levels corporate and
person to person of messaging. In the former, most of the data sent and
received is information such as MIS, sales and purchase reports. And as
our test of the market showed, most corporate messaging in India uses
the same service provider, with all branches and users connected to the
same system. Corporate messaging also uses value-added options such as
message confirmation and faxing. On the other hand, person-to-person
messaging is not restricted to a single provider, and is usually
across systems.

To send e-mail, a user has to first prepare the message, and then dial
in to the provider's nearest node to send or receive mail. The software
provided helps the user manage messages. And the service provider needs
to ensure that e-mail sent reaches its destination at soon as possible,
without losing content or importance.

In this review, we have checked each of these stages. Service and
support was tested in some detail. It has not been included in the
rankings, as we were unable to duplicate test conditions with every
vendor. Security of the system and mail has not been tested.

Test messages were exchanged from Delhi and Bangalore to the other test
account at Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai, at predetermined times. And all
locations were checked (in alphabetic order) at hourly intervals for
mail receipt.

To connect to a node, we tried two alternate numbers, five times each.

If a connection was not established, we proceeded to the next service,
and only returned the busy ones at the end of the cycle.

To test the supplied software's ability to handle attachments, a
standard attachment consisting of a BMP file embedded in a Word
document was used.

PRAKASHAK: ADD INDIAN LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES TO WINDOWS APPS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Prakashak brings multilingual capabilities to your computer, and it runs
on DOS, Windows and Macs. It is available for Devanagari (Hindi),
Kannada, Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya and
Gurumukhi (Punjabi). Prakashak for Windows comes with a bundled DOS
editor. But to install the app, you need to do separate installs for DOS
and Windows, and both require the key disk. All copy protection schemes
are irritating, and this one is no exception.

Prakashak's DOS-based text editor lets you enter multilingual text. It
has regular word processor features such as indents, tabs, fonts, and
type styles. And also supports multiple columns, mail-merge, and macros.

However, the package lacks a spell-checker and transliteration
facilities. But it's fast and print quality is reasonable.

The mail-merge option lets you merge text in both English and Hindi.

However, you have to be careful to maintain the correct format while
making your data file entries. Just one wrong entry and the editor
crashes to the DOS prompt.

To use the Windows version, run your favorite Windows word processor or
DTP app, and then run Prakashak for Windows. Choose the Languages option
on the Prakashak main menu bar and select the language you've installed.

Now select Phonetic or Graphical keyboard mapping. In our tests, we
found phonetic mapping a lot more intuitive. Choosing either option
brings up a dialog box listing all running applications that work with
Prakashak. Select the application you want to use and you can begin
work. You can also create custom keyboard layouts using the DOS-based
INSTALL.EXE utility.

The Filter option lets you convert files created in the Prakashak DOS
editor to ASCII, RTF or Ventura format. Set Defaults lets you select one
application that will run every time you run Prakashak. You can also
define hot keys to invoke macros. You can have four such macros to let
you switch between languages and fonts using a hot key. These macros
worked fine with Write using the default hot key of Ctrl-F3 but they
didn't work properly with Word for Windows.

Prakashak worked well with PageMaker 5, and files created using the DOS
editor and converted to RTF format imported well. Prakashak's manuals
are comprehensive. The program comes with several true type fonts for
Windows. It also works with ATM fonts. However, as an add-on, it's an
expensive solution, when cheaper alternatives are available, especially
for Indian languages.

PRODUCT    : Prakashak for Windows (with Prakashak DOS Editor).

FEATURES   : Available in Devanagari, Kannada, Telegu, Tamil, Malayalam,
             Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya and Gurumukhi scripts with keyboard
             mapping and fonts. Has Phonetic or Graphical keyboard mapping.
             DOS-based editor.

PRICE      : Rs 12,500 (one script). Rs 9,000 (each additional script).
             Rs 9,000 (upgrade with DDE for FoxPro with one typeface).
             Rs 21,000 (DDE and DTP per language with all typefaces)

SUMMARY    : An Indian language solution that gives additional capabilities
             to your Windows word processor and DTP software. Fonts are
             available for True Type and ATM. Expensive as an add-on.

NEC VERSA 4080H: NEC'S LATEST VERSA IS AN ELEGANT MULTIMEDIA PENTIUM

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

This is NEC's upgraded Versa note-book, and unlike the Cyrix-based
Versa 550D we reviewed in August, this one runs on an Intel
Pentium/120. NEC's finally got rid of the trackball and put an elegant
and functional touchpad. And the 100-240V mains adapter is so tiny, I
wish they'd fit it into the notebook itself.

There's extensive power management, and the Phoenix Powerpanel, a
floating button-bar that lets you, with one click, choose "high battery
life", or presentation quality, or a custom setting; or suspend the
notebook, or, best of all, save memory contents to a disk file and power
off.

On the display panel are the brightness control and two small
loudspeaker grills at the top corners. Great place for speakers, though
these are a bit tinny and weak (0.15 watt each). Some other neat touches
included a rear infrared port and when you use the optional docking
station, this is disabled and a second infrared port on the front goes
active. You can select this through an on-screen button, too.

We tested a very limited 8 MB model, a tight squeeze for most apps. With
multimedia, 16 MB is a basic requirement.

The Versa's TFT active matrix display is clear and sharp head-on, and
reasonably clear as you change your viewing angle horizontally, but
things get a little fuzzy with a change of vertical angle especially
when looking at color photos. A possible reason could be that we had
trouble setting the display to above 256 colors.

The lithiumion battery packs enough power, and ran multimedia apps and
a CD-ROM for about 90 minutes. The CD-ROM and floppy drive fit into the
same bay, so you have to choose between them.

The unit we got was a straight US import, with a US mains plug, and the
promise of 24-hour hotline support (presumably in the US). The manual's
comprehensive (though older than the notebook), with even a bit on what
to do when you're travelling (documents for Customs checks, etc). The
body stickers, however, say "Versa 4000", which is the older DSTN model.

A well-featured elegant multimedia notebook that is adequately powered
for most apps, as long as you take it with 16 MB.

PRODUCT   : NEC Versa 4080H
SPECS     : Multimedia notebook with Pentium/120 MHz, CD-ROM, floppy drive,
            10.4" TFT color display. Dual infrared (S-IR) ports, PCMCIA
            Type II/III.

Lithium-Ion battery

SUMMARY   : An elegant and well-integrated multimedia notebook with a
            CD-ROM drive, but somewhat weak sound. Light, high-power battery,
            active-matrix display.

PRICE     : Rs 225,000 (8 MB) Rs 235,000 (16 MB).

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: ESSENTIAL TOOLS: PUBLICIZING YOUR WEB
PAGE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

A new user queried the Apple Internet Authoring mailing list for advice
on getting the word out about his new Web page. The query drew this
detailed and cogent response (www.counsel.net/info/marketing.html)
from Bob Reap. It's a blueprint for doing the hard work of letting the
world know about your site, to the point of diminishing returns.

Learning To Think Like An E-mail Direct Marketer

Whether you call it "marketing via e-mail" or "spamming," you might be
interested in following a moderated conversation among its
practitioners. The Direct E-mail Marketing Association (DEMA) hosts a
mailing list and Web archive (kww.com/dema/). I've subscribed for a
while now and even posted once or twice. The moderator, Rob Zee
maintains an upbeat tone and seems sincerely to want to educate the list
about what is and is not acceptable behavior on the Web with the goal of
finding ways to make unsolicited commercial e-mail palatable to
recipients and ISPs. Zee is also collecting names/addresses of netizens
who wish not to receive commercial e-mail; he plans to make the list
publicly available, at which time reputable marketers should begin to
filter their mailing lists against it.

I learned of the DEMA list from Phil Agre's Red Rock Eater news service.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: FOLLOW-UP: HOW'S JAVA DOING?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

On Sun's first Java Day, I alluded to the new (to me) idea that the Java
language might be good for more than animating Web pages. Last
November people weren't talking much about the intranet with a little
"i". It has since become a commonplace that the money made from Net
technologies over the next several years, at least, will mostly be made
by targeting the builders of corporate intranets. The MIS world is now
taking seriously the notion of using intranets and Web browsers to
develop and deliver corporate applications. In a real sense Web
technology has picked up the gauntlet from the declining client/server
model.

Here are some recent developments in the conquering march of Java.

IBM has announced that the next version of its OS/2, code-named Merlin,
will have Java technology built-in to the operating system l Remember Taligent?
The late collaboration (by everyone except Microsoft) to invent next-
generation frameworks for software development folded its tent some time ago.
Now the Computer Industry Daily reports that Sun has licensed some of
Taligent's technology specifically its multilingual class libraries to
implement world-wide applications and applets in Java.

Sun has delivered its Java Workshop development environment and is
selling it for $99 for the rest of 1996 a price point far below the
competition's.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: RELIGION ON THE NET

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

It's long been my belief that the content on the Net must mirror the
interests of humans in the aggregate. Business, science, politics,
pornography, religion if people spend energy on it in "meatspace" they
will spend energy on it on the Net. Recently I've been accreting
pointers to religious sites. Here are a few.

A site that offers free home pages to churches and Christian-related
groups (www.churchsurf.com/).

The Monetary of Christ in the Desert (www.christdesert.org/pax.html),
where the brothers have brought the ancient art of the illuminated
manuscript into the electronic age.

The German Conference of Bishops recently renounced Confession by
Computer, a PC application developed in Cologne that lets users confess
to one or more of 200 sins. The program also offers advice on how to
reach priests and ministers on the Net.

The Virtual Diocese of Partenia (www. partenia. fr), presided over by
Bishop Jacques Gaillot. This outspoken French bishop was stripped of his
former seat at Evreux by the Pope in 1995. But since bishops cannot be
defrocked unless excommunicated, Gaillot had to be given another
diocese. The Church's solution was to make Gaillot bishop of Partenia, a
small area in the Sahara Desert in which no people have lived for at
least 1,500 years. Since he had been made the Bishop of Nowhere, Gaillot
decided to become the Bishop of Everywhere that is, of cyberspace.

Ultraseek (ultra.infoseek.com) provides a quick count of Web pages
having the following words in their titles. The total of 63,785 compares
favorably with the cyberporn count of 11,702. The words are: church,
temple, mosque, archdiocese (21,740); Hindu, Catholic, Baptist,
Lutheran, Muslim, orthodox, Protestant (19,560); Christian (12,569);
bible, Koran, Torah (6,120); and Jesus, Buddha (3,796)

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: PIONEER ANONYMOUS REMAILER SHUTTERS
THE SHOP

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Johan (Julf) Helsingius of Finland, who has run the anonymous e-mail
server anon.penet.fi since 1993, shut it down last week. On 25 August
1995 the British Observer newspaper had run a banner-headline front-page
article (scallywag.com/) titled "The Peddlers Of Child Abuse." The
article, which is both technically inaccurate and seemingly libelous (a
lawsuit has in fact been filed), accuses Helsingius and the owner of
England's largest ISP of willing complicity in child pornography.

Helsingius attributed his decision not to the Observer article's
appearance, but rather to the lack of clearly defined laws relating to
the Internet. Helsingius is a scarred veteran of the anonymity wars,
fighting the Church of Scientology to keep the identity of a user
private.

Other anonymous remailers remain in service; Community ConneXion
supports a free encrypting interface to ten of them
(www.c2.net/remail/).

the volume of unwanted spam e-mail is the now number-one complaint of
its members. One of the alleged spammers, Cyber Promotions Inc, filed
suit, and the next day a Federal judge ordered AOL to stop blocking the
mailings pending a trial scheduled for November. AOL has appealed.

TASTY BITS FROM THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT: ARE NT WORKSTATION & NT SERVER THE
SAME?

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

TBTF for August 8 (see PCQ September 1996) summarized a messy fight
between Microsoft and Netscape, et al, over the licensing provisions of
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. One of the combatants not mentioned in the
earlier coverage is O'Reilly Associates, who like Netscape makes a Web
server that can run on the less expensive NTW platform. Two days ago
O'Reilly senior editor, Andrew Schulman published an article
(www.software.ora.com/news/ms_internet_andrews.html) claiming that NTW
and NTS are in fact identical, except for the values of two registry
settings (www.pcweek.com/news/0902/06ent.html). Tests run by PC Week
(www.pcweek.com /news /0826/26lic.html) are cited in the O'Reilly
article, although the results seem to me to bolster Microsoft's claim
that NTS is optimized for a server role. (Either Microsoft's or
Netscape's server, running on either NTW or NTS, could easily serve
enough users to saturate a T1 connection, according to PC Week.)

TRAINING BLUES - THE IDEAL COMPUTER COURSE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The quality of computer education in most of the parts in India is still
pathetic. Much of the problem stems from the fact that the  educators
are as ignorant as the students. I have come across many people who are
career trainers, and have little to no understanding of the discipline
they are teaching. In fact, our value systems make this paradoxical
situation possible you could hardly expect a student to explain in not
more than five lines the difference between programming in FORTRAN and
an RDBMS language.

What follows is my own humble contribution to help lessen the problem a
hypothetical course for students aspiring to be career developers. The
course structure assumes that candidates know how to use a PC and a word
processor.

It starts with a course in Pascal programming not Basic, COBOL, or C.
Pascal is the ideal language to make one start thinking in structured
terms that you would find useful throughout your career. Another
advantage is, one will find the books on data structures, algorithms and
compilers easy to understand as most of them use Pascal as the reference
language.

The next course would be a trimester-long-unit devoted to solving
programming problems. Students would be expected to use their knowledge
of Pascal to solve a long series of programming problems, mostly of the
traditional variety. Learning to struggle with easy to state but tough
to solve problems does much in developing clear thinking. Moreover,
students get to understand their true aptitude for the subject matter.
The student would take a course in Windows and PC software usage in
parallel with the above. This course would focus on using software like
dBASE, MS Word, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and the like for day-to-day
applications. In addition the students would be exposed to advanced MS
DOS concepts and Windows fundamentals.

The next few courses would focus on commercial problem solving using
COBOL, assembly language programming, and an insight into computer
architecture. Students would be asked to write programs for a mini
payroll or general ledger system. The computer architecture and assembly
language course would provide the student with an elementary idea of the
innards of the computer and the basic operations it is capable of. The
lab exercises of this course would focus on writing small programs in
8086 assembler with exposure to BIOS and DOS services. The computer
architecture course is central to the understanding of a whole range of
concepts.

The next trimester would focus on systems programming and C language.
The former would cover elementary ideas about compilers, interpreters
and operating systems. The students would be given a comprehensive
exposure to technical nitty-gritty such as concurrency, time sharing,
and security. Parallely, they would learn to use C language to develop
small utilities, such as those for encrypting and compressing files.

The penultimate semester would cover databases and networking. True
justice should be done to these courses since students would have an
adequate background to understand many of the central issues of these
topics. Concurrent lab coverage would include developing
network-compatible programs and skills on popular RDBMS packages.
The last semester would provide a set of optional courses such as
Windows programming, advanced RDBMS, object oriented programming, and
elements of accounting.

The bottom line This might not be the optimal course structure, but far
better than teaching C as the first programming language.

WATCH YOUR PC ON TV

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

We are often asked why we prefer external modems to internal ones. And
since most internal modems have a built-in 16550 UART and a lower price
tag.

Well, there are several reasons for this. Let's start with one of the
more disastrous ones. Have you ever switched on your PC while watching
TV in the next room. More often than not, the screen starts shaking and
all kinds of strange lines appear on-screen. This is caused by
inadequate shielding of the PC's power supply. Without a body to
approve electrical emissions, such as the FCC, vendors don't pay much
attention to the quality of the power supply's filter circuits. The
result lots of electrical emissions than can and do cause interference
with just about any electronic device.

Now imagine your poor little internal modem card sitting right next to
this power supply. If the TV next door can be effected, think of what's
happening to a something right next to the source of all this
interference. You get miserable performance as lots of noise is added to
already dismal telephone line conditions. Given that our telephone
system is not the best money can buy we land up with problems ranging
from bad or almost no connects, to low transfer rates when trying to
transfer files.

There are several other reasons against using internal modems, but our
idea here is just to warn you about what you could be getting into.
Another hair-raising example is the possibility of being struck by
lightening while online during a storm. This can happen to both
external and internal modems. With an external modem all that goes
normally is just the modem. But for an internal modem you could
burnout the whole PC. Not to mention any other peripherals such as the
monitor, keyboard and printer. Think about it.

AND HOW THEY FARED: WITH EVERYBODY PERFORMING QUITE WELL, PRICE & FEATURES
DETERMINE EDITOR'S CHOICE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The results of our tests were initially quite surprising. Unlike the
V.32bis modems that were quite common in 1994-95, the V.34 modems tested
this year produced near identical performance results. At first we
though our tests had some flaws, but after running through the test
suites several times, we realized what was really making the difference
was the V.34 specification itself.

In the Sibling Test, there was a mere 2.66 percent difference in speed
between the highest and the lowest connect times. And all speeds were
consistent with what we expected at 28,800 bps (in theory, a 28,800 bps
modem in V.42 mode will transfer at a maximum speed of 3,600 characters
per second; actual speeds were better than 90 percent of this in all
cases).

In the ISP Access Tests, differences in speed amounted to no more than
3.8 percent. All the modems remained rock-steady while connected. And
all of them survived the three minute beep without major incidents.
In fact, the total variance in scores for performance is as low as 11
(out of 100). And in such a scenario, buying decisions will be
influenced very much by features, bundled goodies and most importantly,
the price tag.

For this years shootout, we have modems offering more or less similar
performance, with price tags varying between Rs 10,000 to Rs 40,000. And
some modems also have features that could justify, at least partially,
the higher prices. However, others, and in particular, the Motorola
Premier and the US Robotics Courier V.Everything, simply cannot justify
their prices, given their feature sets.

Some vendors may argue that their modems are faster (having a top speed
of 33,600 bps), but the implementation of this speed is simply a
superset of the V.34 standard used by all modems. And other
manufacturers can argue that they won't implement a speed standard that
had not been ratified by the ITU. (Remember the V.FC episode from early
1995, where many manufacturers jumped the gun and implemented V.FC to
deliver 28,800 bps, only to find their modems incapable of adjusting
when the official V.34 standard appeared, causing serious damage to
many modem manufacturers' reputations when they had to either recall
modems for factory refitting, or simply orphan them.)

Most of the modems operating at 28,800 bps will be able to upgrade to
33,600 bps once V.34bis is ratified and in all cases this will mean only
a change of Firmware (the control software within the modem) easily
done today with most using Flash ROM upgrades, or simply a Firmware ROM
replacement.

Interestingly, the lowest priced modem in this review, the GVC 28800,
supported the V.34+33,600 bps speed. Forty percent of the modems were
unable to connect at full speed when subjected to the Unknown Modem
Test. This should be a pointer for users working with bad lines or
questionable modems at the other end.

The final decision boiled down to the two most important factors
insofar as the Indian market is concerned price and the Out-Of-Box
Experience.

When we applied the Brown-Gibson model to our results, the Boca was
unquestionably on top. It had a 12 point lead over the ZyXEL Omni and a
19 point lead over the Hayes that came in third. The GVC came in fourth,
loosing mainly on features. Motorola, who changed their modem pricing
from Rs 21,000 to Rs 31,000 during the review, dropped to ninth place,
despite very good performance and features. The US Robotics Courier
dropped from last year's top-three to the eighth place, despite top
marks for performance, because of its price.

Happy high speed connects.

ZYXEL OMNI 288S: GOOD BALANCE OF PRICING & FEATURES, COMPLEMENTED BY
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Omni 288S is not exciting to look at, but provides good value for
money. This is a basic dial-up model, with just enough LEDs. However,
their location on top of the case is not very ergonomic. And to see
what's happening you need to look down at the modem a not so comfortable
position.

It uses the same manual and software as the Elite 2864, which makes it
extremely easy to use. However, it also shares the same shortcomings no
Win 95 INF files, and more or less the same performance online.
Like the Elite, the Omni too can be upgraded via Flash ROM. And we hope
its quality will `ripen with age' like any good wine. ZyXEL is well
known for issuing frequent firmware upgrades (even in the 1496 series),
so one can expect that online performance will improve over time.
At Rs 16,000, the Omni is priced about the same as the US Robotics
Sportster 28800, and its PPF is the lowest in the entire review six
percent below the estimated fair landed price!

The modem's price-to-features balance made it a serious contender for
the top slot, but the Boca wins on better pricing and a slightly better
performance.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : ZyXEL Omni 288S

PRICE     : Rs 16,000

SUMMARY   : The Omni gives above average performance and a very good
            price-to-features balance. A no frills dial-up model, the Omni
            gets the second rank, and is highly recommended.

ZYXEL ELITE 2864: GOOD FEATURES & MATCHING PRICING, BUT AVERAGE
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Although ZyXEL terms the Elite 2864 a `Do Everything' modem, we would
prefer calling it a multimedia modem because of its obvious stress on
features such as voice traffic.

It sports a sweeping design, with the largest number of LEDs on its
status panel and supports both serial as well as parallel connections to
the PC. It also has an optional RAM upgrade that can receive faxes
without being connected to a PC. It can also be upgraded to ISDN
capabilities (albeit at a stiff price tag)

It came without any Win95 INF files, and we had to download these from
the Internet before we could install this modem. This is a bit of a
Catch 22 situation to install the modem, you need to use it first, which
you can't. The bundled software, Triofax, is a full voice mail system
that is very easy to use. However, it does not support Win95's TAPI
functions.

The manual is really elaborate, with lots of diagrams and configuration
options something new users will definitely appreciate.

The many LEDs let you see the status from across the room. And the
powerful speaker can really rock the room when it handshakes. Online, it
was unable to reproduce the magic of its predecessor, the 1496 series.
It retrained more than usual, and in the unknown modem test,
consistently failed to connect at 28,800 bps.

ZyXEL uses Flash ROM to update its firmware. Several such upgrades have
addressed many problems in earlier models. One hopes that the Elite 2864
too will also eventually become as stable as the 1496 series at which
point it will become a serious contender. upgrade ability to ISDN may not
seem much now, but when ISDN becomes a reality, this will ensure that
the modem does not become obsolete.

Earlier priced at Rs 35,000, the Elite has been more comfortably
repriced to Rs 25,000, and sports a really low PPF of eight percent

RATING:

PRODUCT   : ZyXEL Elite 2864

PRICE     : Rs 25,000

SUMMARY   : The Elite has an elaborate LED display, and sports a sweeping
            design. Offers ISDN upgradeability and a RAM upgrade can enable
            it to receive faxes without attaching to a PC.

US ROBOTICS SPORTSTER 28800: A NO-FRILLS MODEL WITH BELOW AVERAGE
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Sportster 28800 is the natural successor to the Sportster 14400. It
looks near identical to the older models a not highly ergonomic shape
and insufficient LEDs. And there is no voice/data toggle switch either.
The modem too comes with little documentation when the first Sportster
was first introduced in India, we were impressed with the quality of
documentation, but things seem to have changed. The manuals are useful
if you know about modems, but a novice would be lost in the jargon
jungle.

Like its sibling, the V.Everything, this one too comes without a serial
cable, which leaves you wondering how to connect the modem to your PC.
That is until your told that you have to buy this necessary component
separately the equivalent of saying `batteries not included'.
Online, this modem was not very stable, and had problems dealing with
the modem in our ISP Access and in the unknown modem test. In the former
it managed to connect, but retrained often. As for the latter, it could
not connect at 28800 bps.

At Rs 15,500, it carries a PPF of almost 70 percent.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : US Robotics Sportster 28800

PRICE     : Rs 15,500

SUMMARY   : Indifferent performance, lack of features and over pricing
            caused this to fall in the ratings

US ROBOTICS COURIER V. EVERYTHING: EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE & FEATURES WITH A
STIFF PRICE TAG

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Black, sleek, excellent performance, and very expensive. Add to all this
a pretty fabulous software bundle, which just about sums up the US
Robotics Courier V. Everything.

Unlike the low-end Sportster, this one is a real work horse, and has
been a long favorite with service providers world wide, and with good
reason too. It supports virtually every modem protocol ever invented
(including V.FC, V.32terbo and V.34), as well as the yet to be
established V.34+ running at 33,600 bps). When you use the V.Everything,
you'll never need to worry about compatibility issues.

The modem too is an ergonomic delight sized and shaped to fit under a
standard phone, or as part of a pile of modems stacked one over the
other. It also has a programmable switch that is user customizable
(though the default is a voice/data toggle switch). A slider volume
control makes it easy to "listen in" on a link for audio debugging, and
the bank of DIP switches at the bottom are great for configuring it for
non-PC applications, such as mainframes. And for those in the habit of
misplacing their manuals the Courier has the most important commands
printed on its bottom. The supplied documentation was a bit obtuse, but
usable nevertheless.

The V.Everything has a pretty overpowering software bundle in the form
of two CD-ROMs packed with lots of useful applications, including an
accounting system, communication and Internet software, as well as other
utilities. And all these with a multimedia front end that is a pleasure
to use.

Win95 had built-in drivers for this modem, so there were no problems.
Surprisingly, there was no serial cable supplied - a serious drawback.
Online, it worked steadily and reliably. File transfer speeds were on
par with the other modems. What really let it down was the pricing at Rs
28,000, it is priced out of reach for most users, which is a pity. A
more realistic price would have made this the unbeatable choice for the
masses. As it stands, the high price tag represents a PPF of about 50
percent

RATING:

PRODUCT    : US Robotics Courier V.Everything

PRICE      : Rs 28.000

SUMMARY    : An excellent but expensive workhorse with lots of software.
             The unrealistic pricing and average features really lost it
             points.

MULTITECH 2834 BL: LEASED-LINE MODEM THAT'S EXPENSIVE FOR DIAL-UP USE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Similar to its predecessor the 1432 BL, the 2834 BL too is encasedin a
metal box. It looks sturdy and is projected as high-end modem.
Unfortunately, it also comes with a high price tag; the highest in this
shootout.

The 2834 BL's front panel is quite impressive. It has all the relevant
LEDs including speed indicators and a voice/data toggle switch. The
power supply is an inline block type with a strange connector that
actually locks in place, but sometimes falls off every now and then. The
modem also has a small volume control knob at the back. Apart from the
regular serial and phone connectors, it also had a 4-wire leased line
connector the only modem to have that.

The 2834 BL has excellent documentation with the manual adequately
explaining all the features and settings. The bundled software is
MultiExpress which has its own separate manual. Also supplied is a
serial cable. There are no extra drivers required as the modem is listed
in Win95 and worked without any problems. In terms of performance, the
2834 BL was a little on the lower side. It had the highest handshake
time and the transfer rates were average both on the EPABX as well as on
the transfers with VSNL. The modem does support the V.34+ protocol and
in our cross tests, it did connect at V.34+ 33,600 bps.

Overall the modem passes muster, but its not for the average buyer. The
steep price of Rs 39,500 places it out of most users budgets. But it
does have the advantage of being leased line compatible, and would be a
good for corporate buyers. The 2834 BL is an expensive even abroad, but
in India its PPF works out to 64 percent.

RATING:

PRODUCT     : Multitech MT 2834 BL

PRICE       : Rs 39,950

SUMMARY     : The 2834 BL gave average performance and features. Very
              impressive front panel, plus leased-line support.

MOTOROLA PREMIER 33.6: A HEFTY PRICE TAG LETS THE PREMIER DOWN

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

At first glance, the Motorola Premier invoked a sense of dejavu it
looks identical to the Motorola Lifestyle 28.8 reviewed last year. The
only visible difference we could find was the higher operating speed
(33,600 bps using the as-yet unratified V.34+ specification) and its
price of Rs 31,000.

A quick check at Motorola's Web site showed that this was indeed the now
discontinued Lifestyle, with a few additional features, none of which
affect everyday use. The modem now has a Flash ROM feature that allows
Motorola to update the modem's controlling firmware through a software
upgrade. And it also has additional features such as synchronous
operation and V.25bis dialing (used only when connecting to certain
mainframes). It's DTE (Terminal interface) rate can go twice as high as
the Lifestyle's (230.4 Kbps instead of 115.2 Kbps), but this feature
that will mean little to the average user, whose PC can only `talk' at
speeds up to 115.2 Kbps. The modem also incorporates some security
features such as 20 user security profiles and remote configuration,
which would be useful when the Premier is used in a host environment.
The modem itself is encased in a sleek `slab of cheese' plastic
body first seen in the Lifestyle with an insufficient number of LEDs to
let the user know what's going on. There is no voice/data toggle switch.

And the documentation is somewhat on the skimpy side definitely not for
first time users though reasonably comprehensive for experienced ones.
In actual use, the Premier performed as expected from a true Motorola
modem (unlike the Fastalk models which are rebranded, the Lifestyle
modems are actually manufactured by Motorola). Online performance was
stable, though some quirks did show up. In the default setup, the modem
would connect at 2400 bps unless forced to 28,800 bps this was probably
a flaw in the firmware that should be rectified by now.

Motorola worldwide has begun a global product repositioning exercise,
where certain models are priced as premium models as in their cellular
phone range and the Premier too seems a victim of this.

None of the available features can justify the Rs 31,000 price tag, and
we wonders just who exactly is Motorola targeting. It does not have
4-wire leased line or voice facilities that would have helped justify
the price. And since Motorola worldwide has discontinued the Lifestyle
(as announced on their own web site), it doesn't have a modem that
caters to the lower end of the market. The Premier could easily have
been priced at around Rs 18,000, which would have been fair. As it
stands, the Rs 31,000 price tag represents a PPF of almost 80 percent.
While the Motorola scored an impressive 96 out of 100 on Performance,
and a not too bad on Features, but out priced itself from the
competition!

RATING:

PRODUCT       : Motorola Premier 33.6

PRICE         : Rs 31,000

SUMMARY       : WWW. The Premier gave good performance and is reasonable in
                features. But its pricing robbed it of a possible top three
                position, if not the Editor's Choice itself

HAYES ACCURA 288 MESSAGE: GOOD PERFORMANCE & COULD DO BETTER ON FEATURES

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The Accura 288 is a sleek little modem, like most of the other models
reviewed. The manufacturer have decided to pay attention to the
modem's appearance too. Its packaged in a simple plastic casing,
making the Accura one of the lightest. The power supply is of the
small socket-mounted type.

The box contains a serial cable, a small booklet masquerading as the
manual and which is by no means complete, and SmartCom software. This
comes with its own, larger manual and the first time when we looked at
the documentation, we assumed (wrongly) that the SmartCom manual would
also have details for the modem.

On the front panel, the modem sports the regular number of LEDs. The
back panel has the connector for the serial port, the phone and line
jacks and the power switch. There is no volume control or voice/data
switch. With SmartCom, the modem can act as a complete messaging
station with answering machine. Since our tests did not involve these
abilities, this feature was not tested.

As of performance, the Accura fared quite well. Its handshake time was
average and the file transfer rates on both the internal EPABX tests as
well as the VSNL tests were very good. In fact, the Accura 288 had the
highest file transfer speed in the ISP test. But it did have a problem
connecting to our unknown modem. For some reason, it would constantly
step down to V.34 21,600 bps. We tried several times but always got
connected at this rate. And this cost the Accura valuable performance
points. Similarly, it scored a total blank in "Others", making it to
third place overall.

Overall, the modem performed well, but is overpriced at Rs 15,750, which
represents a PPF of more than 70 percent. Nevertheless, this is not such
a bad modem.

RATING:

PRODUCT     : Hayes Accura 288 Message

PRICE       : Rs 15,750

SUMMARY     : Good performance but for connect speeds to the unknown modem.

Using the bundled software, the modem can act as a complete messaging
station.

GVC 28800: AN ATTRACTIVE LOW COST OPTION WITHOUT SACRIFICING ON
PERFORMANCE

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The GVC 28800 modem looks quite similar to the older Hayes V Series
modems. A silver metallic case with a bit of black, quite compact and
neat. Despite the fact that its made of metal, its extremely light. The
power supply for the GVC too is the small socket mounted variety.
The front panel had just a row of LEDs, nothing else. There was no
voice/data toggle or speaker adjust knobs; just the power switch at the
back, with phone line in and out jacks connectors and the serial
connector. There even was no indicator for speed. There was an HS
indicator for any speed exceeding 2,400 bps, and a TST LED for retrains.
Speaker volume is controlled using software. But the speaker is a bit
tinny, and the V.34 handshake can really make it shriek, so you should
adjust the volume to as low as possible.

Appearances aside, the modem behaves quite well. We managed to get some
pretty good results calling over the EPABX, and on our direct line tests
as well. Rock steady file transfers and a reasonably low handshake time
gave the GVC a slight, early lead in performance. We did not encounter
any problems connecting to our unknown modem. Every connect was at V.34
28,800 bps. The GVC also supports the V.34+ protocol, so in some tests
we even managed to get a 33,600 bps connect.

A feature that we really missed, was online statistics or last call
analysis. At high-speed, it really nice to know where the problems lie.
Many modems these days have a register which can be checked for the
details of the last call.

The modems factory defaults are properly configured for hardware
(CTS/RTS) flow control, and we did not have to make any changes at all
to get it to work, other than the X register for detection of dialing
tones.

A skimpy little 22 page manual comprises the modem's documentation. And
QuickLink II the bundled software. No serial cable was provided, but
Win95 drivers were supplied.

Overall a good modem, it performed well in all tests, with best part
being the price. At Rs 10,000 it is definitely the cheapest 28.8 kbps
modem available today. And it comes with a three year warranty. The PPF
is 23 percent, which means you can expect the price to come down a bit.
However, the absence of adequate documentation, a serial cable,
voice/data switch and other features cost the GVC dearly, that it could
not recover despite its low price. The GVC ended up in fourth place.

RATING:

PRODUCT   : GVC 28800

PRICE     : Rs 10,000

SUMMARY   : Good performance and attractive pricing. Lost out on features.

BOCA MV.34EE: GOOD PERFORMANCE & ATTRACTIVE PRICING SETS THE BOCA APART

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Packaged in an all black plastic case, the Boca MV.34 EE looks nice and
sleek. The modem is small, light, and very portable. And the power
supply is the standard, two-pin socket mounted type.

The front panel has several LEDs, but none indicate the connect speed.

It appears to be trend not to provide a speed indicator on the front
panel, but to use software instead. The Boca however does have an
indicator for retrain a thoughtful touch. In most of the tests
conducted, the modem hardly ever retrained, so at first we actually
thought there was no retrain indicator.

The Boca comes with adequate documentation. There's a nice 94 page
booklet that gives you all the information you need. As for drivers,
none are shipped, but it is recognized and listed in Win95 so it worked
without any problems. Also bundled is Faxworks 3.0, a fax software. In
terms of completeness, this was one of the few modems shipped with a
serial cable.

Performance-wise the Boca was really good. It did not have the fastest
handshake times or even the highest transfer rates, yet was extremely
steady. It did very well on all the tests, over the EPABX, as well as
during direct calls to VSNL. Even the test with our unknown modem were
very good. As the Boca does not support the V.34+ protocol, all connects
were at V.34 28,800 bps.

The price tag of Rs.13,500 is attractive, and includes a five year
warranty. Overall a good modem, with excellent performance. The modem
scored a low 18 percent Premium Profit Factor, which is commendable.
Steady performance, good features and a decent price makes the Boca
MV.34EE the Editor's Choice.

RATING:

PRODUCT      : Bocamodem MV .34 EE

PRICE        : Rs 13, 500

SUMMARY      : Good features and pricing combine with performance to make
               the Boca modem the winner in this shootout.

THE PC QUEST 1996 MODEM SHOOTOUT: THE TESTS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

The sibling test

Each modem was tested back to back (not over a phone line) against a
modem of the same make and model. This determined how the modem would
behave in what could be called `unchallengeable ideal conditions'. It
should be noted that though some modems were capable of speeds up to
33,600 bps using the as-yet-undefined V.34+ standard (expected to become
V.34bis sometime in late October), we forced the modems to connect at
28,800 bps to keep results consistent. And a standard ZIP file was
transferred to test transmit speeds.

The Inter-operability Test

Each modem was tested back to back (not over a phone line) against all
the other models in the review. This brought out any problems that a
modem could face when connecting to another modem from a different
vendor, as is likely to happen when you connect to any BBS or Internet
service.

The ISP Access And Data Transfer Test

Each modem was tested repeatedly against a specific modem at VSNL (the
sole public Internet Service Provider, as yet) over a standard phone
line. The ZIP file was used to test transfer speeds. This represented
the most common usage of such modems. As in the Sibling tests, we forced
the modems to work at 28,800 bps, though this was actually unnecessary,
as VSNL's modems do not go beyond 28,800 bps.

The Unknown Modem Test

Each modem was tested over telephone lines against the same modem (from
a vendor not included in this review).

Pricing

We also calculated the `Premium Profit Factor' (PPF) a comparison of the
US street prices with the prices at which the modem is sold in
India though we did not include this factor for the actual ranking. The
PPF was calculated by estimating the landed cost in India, based on the
US street price, using $1=Rs 36, and adding 50 percent to this value
towards import and marketing expenses. This value, deemed as a fair
price, is then compared to the actual Indian price, and expressed as a
percentage above the estimated fair price. The higher the percentage,
the bigger the PPF. Use this value to estimate the chances of the price
dropping in the near future the higher the differential, the higher the
chances for a price drop.

How We Ranked Them

In order to determine the rankings, we used the standard PCQ Labs
Performance-Features-Price model and the Brown-Gibson model to arrive at
the weightages of individual parameters. Given below are the parameters,
and their associated weightages

Performance

File transfer rate (cps)               50
Connect speed to unknown modem         33
Time taken to handshake with sibling   17
Total                                  100
Price                                  100

Features

Documentation                          31
Serial Cable provided                  31
Win 95 INF file provided               19
Voice                                  13
Others                                 6
Total                                  100

NB: For `Others' we looked at the following six factors V.34 +, Lease
Line Option, Connect Speed Indication, Retrain Indication, and
Voice/Data switch. The presence of each meant one point.

PC QUEST 1996 MODEM SHOOTOUT: PCQ LABS TORTURE-TEST 10 V.34 MODEMS

from PC QUEST (India), OCTOBER, 1996

Every year around this time, here at PCQ Labs we spend a considerable
amount of time testing modems. And this year too, this activity has been
more frenetic than ever before, mainly because of the incredible demand
for modems that has resulted from VSNL's introduction of publicly
accessible Internet services.

While laying down the test parameters for this year's review, PCQ Labs
was faced with the decision about what modems to review. We have found
that users tend to refer to our reviews throughout the year, and its
therefore very important to ensure a line up of modems that can cater to
the demands for the next year (or until our next shoot-out).

So we decided to exclude any modem that does not offer speeds of 28,800
bps or more. The reasoning is actually quite simple VSNL now offers
V.34, 28,800 bps access in all cities and demand for modems operating at
these speeds has risen sharply. The biggest factor in this increase has
been a rapid rise of World Wide Web content and Web pages are now
incredibly rich both in graphical and multimedia content. This is good,
but at the same time, pages such as these require high access speeds
before you can see what you're supposed to.

Our minimum specification was that reviewed modems should be external,
V.34 models, at the very least. The inherent instability of the previous
standard (V.32bis), plus the low speeds achieved by such modems made
them less desirable. And finally, the low prices of modems today (the
lowest we tested cost just Rs 10,000, with average street prices for
high quality, V.34 modems being around Rs 16,000) effectively ruled out
V.32bis 14,400 bps modems priced just 20 percent less.

In this shoot-out, we have managed a fair sampling of the market. Some
models are however missing: World Wide Technologies withdrew after
submitting a model for the shootout. And the US Robotics Voice modem was
not tested because they could provide only one modem as against the two
required by our tests.

How We Tested

For testing the modems, we kept in mind the fact that almost all
potential purchasers would be using them to connect to VSNLs Internet
services. We therefore tested these modems against a typical modem
running at VSNL (we had access to a specific telephone number and not a
hunt group, ensuring that we had the same line and equipment conditions
for every test).

We stressed on the "out of box experience" (OOBE) for modems tested.
Usability scored over other factors a modem that was up-and-running
straight out of the box was rated higher than one that took a lot of
tinkering and support. This OOBE was also affected by little things
like if the vendor bothered to supply a serial cable (it was surprising
that some of them didn't), if they offered a 16550A-based serial card
either as a standard or as an option (almost none of them even chose to
make the buyer aware that without this, these modems are effectively
useless), what was the quality and usefulness of documentation
available (modem documentation that is, not software documentation. For
example, GVC shipped a generic 22 page manual devoid of any useful
details), and how the modems performed using their basic factory
(default) settings.

We did not test PCMCIA (PC Card) modems, or internal modems in this
shootout.

The Test Bed

The test bed consisted of two Pentium/100 PCs with 16 MB RAM, running
Windows 95, with the MS Plus! pack installed. And both machines had
16550 UART ports installed. The communication software used was
HyperTerminal 2.0.

             POWERPC OS/2 LIMPS HOME. NO SUPPORT,
               SALES, THIRD PARTIES, - OR FUTURE?

IBM promised that they would have OS/2 for PowerPC finished off
by the end of 1995 and the company appears to have done it - in
both senses of the phrase. OS/2 Warp PowerPC Edition is indeed
available, but only as a PRPQ: a  Program Request For Price
Quotation item. This limbo-state is reserved for the most
nichiest of IBM's niche products; not on general sale, but
available through "the customers usual IBM representative" as a
special order. And the magic product reference that you will need
to quote is '5799.QTZ'.

The product doesn't include any of the Warp Connect parts, and it
only runs on the 604-based PowerSeries 830 and 850 models -
anyone misguided enough to buy a PowerPC-based laptop from IBM
can forget it. Neither does it appear that the company intends to
do much to enhance the product "We are shifting out focus back to
Intel for '96" an Austin-based spokesperson acknowledged last
week. IBM is committed to getting the next Intel-based release
(codenamed Merlin) out this summer, together with server
extensions which go to make up its Eagle offering.

Why PRPQ? "we know that we can reach the people who want it with
this system" said the IBM spokesperson, referring to the 150
customers world- wide who were on the beta programme last year.
The approach has the disadvantage that anyone with a non-IBM
PowerPC machine will not be able to order OS/2 using this method,
but since the operating system will only run on IBM's own 830s
and 850s that is not problematic. No PowerPC manufacturers have
licensed OS/2; and none that we have spoken to have evinced any
enthusiasm for the product.

While we are somewhat loath to pronounce OS/2 for PowerPC   dead,
there is precious little evidence that the product has a future.
The Power Personal Systems division - charged with taking PowerPC
onto the desktop has been disbanded and it was only this division
that had much to gain from OS/2 for PowerPC. The PowerSeries
machines new home - the AIX division - is having a hard enough
time adjusting to having to sell Windows NT, let alone OS/2. At
the same time, the originally much- vaunted plans for a common
code-base for Intel and PowerPC versions have also disappeared
over the horizon. None of IBM's current work  on  the Intel
version includes producing a  micro kernel-based version.

In summary, the future of PowerPC now depends on Windows NT, AIX,
Mac OS and Solaris. OS/2 can safely be ignored for the time
being.

              APPLE DENIES IT'S QUIT THE LOW-END,
                 BUT LEAVES QUESTIONS UNANSWERED

Faced with first quarter losses of $69 million Apple Computer Inc
has announced it will restructure its business and make around
1,300 people -  8% of its workforce redundant. However the
company has denied reports that it is withdrawing from the low-
end home and education market. A spokesman acknowledged, however
that the low-end muddle of Performa and LC machines would be
rationalised, with fewer models on offer.  Meanwhile Apple will
attempt to move away from its technology focus, with new
divisions charged with targetted particular business sectors -
education, consumer, multimedia, publishing and the Internet.

How much this comes to pass remains to be seen, since the Wall
Street Journal believes that a deal that will see Apple bought by
Sun Microsystems is "imminent", with Sun CEO Scott McNeally
putting the finishing touches to the bid. There have been
repeated reports that the two companies have been in negotiations
since September, but this time The Journal seems convinced.

This quarter's figures show Apple's gross margins down as net
revenues dropped to 15.1% of net  sales, down from 28.7% for the
same period a year ago.  Price cutting and increased competition,
particular in Japan were to blame. The job cuts, will eat into
profits in the second quarter - Apple expects to take a pretax
charge then of $125m.

While initial job losses are to come from sales, marketing and
administration,  there is speculation that research and
development staff will not be immune from  future cuts. There's
also a general feeling that one particular job - that belonging
to Michael Spindler, Apple's president and CEO - may be for the
chop.

Though the business changes would appear to be quite radical, the
truth is that a lot more is likely to  come. The board is due to
meet again to flesh out subsequent stages of restructuring and
job cuts will not be the least of it.The most important thing
missing from Apple's  plan is how it will run its business in the
post PPCP (nee CHRP) world.

In a month, maybe two the first PPCP machines notionally able to
run Mac OS  will appear. By the end of 1997 we can expect to see
quite a few in production. Yet Apple's restructuring makes no
mention of this fact - of the fact that it is about to lose
effective control of its compatible hardware base. What does it
intend to do? how does it intend to license Mac OS software -
freely? to selected PPCP manufacturers? to end users?
The details are still missing and until Apple comes up with a
clear public policy users, investors and developers will not be
able to make sensible decisions about the efficacy of its plans.
Companies signing a Mac OS licensing deal are explicitly excluded
from revealing the terms to third parties.

              RADIUS CALLS IT A DAY - HANDS POWER
                   MACINTOSH WORK OVER TO UMAX

Troubled Radius Inc has decided to quit the Mac-clone market and
is selling out to Umax Data Systems. Radius will retain 19.9% of
the new company, Umax Computer Corp which will get  all of
Radius' Mac-making R&D staff, systems designs and key contacts.
Umax intends to ship two  PCI-based Mac compatibles in the second
quarter; one, a 150MHz 604-based box codenamed StormSurge is
aimed at the high-end market, with the 603-based RipTide machine
going for the consumer/education market.

Previously, Umax, best known for its scanners, had announced that
it would have a PPCP (CHRP) machine ready during the second half
of the year, however the upheaval involved in transferring the
R&D team means that this won't now appear until the fourth
quarter, according to Umax Computer's VP and general manager
Peter Mehring.

Unlike Radius' existing machines, the forthcoming boxes  differ
considerably from Apple's own motherboard designs and are based
on work already underway at Radius. The 603-based machine also
breaks with Radius' habit of concentrating on high-end, high-
margin machines for graphics designers. Financial terms of the
deal were not disclosed.

Don Chang, vice chairman and co-founder of Umax Technologies Inc,
a wholly-owned Umax Data unit has been named president and CEO of
UMAX Computer, the company said. Incidentally, Umax founder Huang
is also chairman of Taiwan-based Elitegroup Computer Systems Ltd,
one of four companies from which Apple Computer Inc is reported
to be taking bids for contract manufacturing of 300,000
motherboards per month, which the company wants to sell on to
clone makers. Elite group, First International Computer Co, Acer
Inc and GVC Corp all confirmed to Electrical Engineering Times
that they were in touch with Apple on taking at least part of the
deal.

           IBM STOPS SHIPPING POWER SERIES MACHINES
                   WHILE OS STRATEGY IS SORTED

IBM's AIX division is still taking orders for, but has stopped
shipping PowerSeries machines with Windows NT installed.
Since Power Personal Systems Division was rolled into the AIX
organisation the latter has been mulling to decide how to cope
with the alien OS in its midst. An official announcement is
expected next month that the PowerSeries machines have been re-
dubbed RS/6000s and that these low-end RS/6000s support Windows
NT.

Actual shipments of the machines will not restart until March,
according to sources. And in case you are wondering, no the AIX
division has not been given any remit to sell or support OS/2
Warp PowerPC Edition - you will be able to buy the boxes with
Windows NT, or AIX preinstalled or with no operating system at
all.

             POWER COMPUTING LAUNCHES "MID-RANGE"
                     601-BASED MAC OS BOXES

Power Computing Corp has come out with a new line of mid-range
Mac OS RISC machines at budget prices, under the PowerCurve name.
The Austin, Texas-based Macintosh cloner says the new machines
are CPU upgradable, use the 120MHz POWERPC 601 and the PCI bus.

The PowerCurve 601/120 is available in desktop and low-profile
configurations and has three PCI slots, on-board 10Base-T
Ethernet, optional Level 2 cache, built-in high-performance
video, and a big software bundle including Microsoft Corp's
Office for the first time.

Maximum memory expansion is 256Mb. The on-board VRAM video
enables users to have 2Mb or 4Mb of video RAM with support for up
to 24-bit colour in 1,280 by 1024 pixel resolution. It will
support VGA-style monitors and the VGA connector is auto-sensing.

The base configuration for the low-profile PowerCurve 601/120 is
8Mb memory, 840Mb disk, 2Mb Video RAM on-board, Mac 15-pin and
Super VGA graphics connector, extended keyboard, mouse and
bundled software at $1,850. The desktop version is $1,900; both
models are expected  later this month. The software bundle
includes ClarisWorks, Quicken, SoftWindows 2.0 on 60-day trial,
America Online access software, Grollier's Multimedia
Encyclopaedia CD-ROM.

             MOTOROLA & BULL LOOK TO 4-WAY 200MHZ
                 POWERPC 620 SERVER RUNNING AIX.

Sister publication Unigram.X reports that Motorola Inc and
Compagnie des Machines Bull SA have a four-way POWERPC 620 RISC-
based server with Level 2 cache up and running in Grenoble using
200MHz parts that are said to outperform 200MHz 604s. The machine
is running AIX, and the partners are working on 64-bit channels
and an eight-way implementation is being developed.

Nevertheless, IBM Corp thinks that its Apache chip will be the
first 64- bit symmetric multiprocessing offering to come to
market. Apache, the enhanced AS/400 PowerPC AS part that will
figure in commercial RS/6000s, has been dubbed the POWERPC 625.

RS/6000 assistant general manager Jeff Mason is apparently
circulating a positioning document internally on 620 versus 625
versus 630. The 620 is apparently nine months off its schedule.
The PowerPC 620e that came to light late last year, turns out to
be just a compact implementation of the 620.

           CANADA'S STD TAKES MOTOROLA MOTHERBOARDS
                       TO BUILD PREP BOXES

Another regional PowerPC manufacturer has turned up, this time
its STD Systems Inc, which was uncovered by the reporters on the
Newsbytes Network. STD's range of  CompuPartner Power2
(pronounced Power squared) servers are based on Motorola
motherboard designs, run Windows NT and are mainly going into
Canadian academic and research institutions, with a pension for
floating-point work according to a company spokesman.

The London Ontario-based manufacturer claims to be the fourth
biggest PC company in Canada in terms of sales and have around
19% of Canada's education market. Base systems, built around the
603 start from C$4,000 upward, with the high-end machines
weighing in at  C$8,000.

                 APPLE CUTS PRICES ON TOOLS AS
                   IT SEEKS TO WOO DEVELOPERS

Apple used the MacWorld Expo to show off new versions of its MPW
Pro  products and ETO "Essentials Tools Objects" development
software. At the same time the company slashed prices:  MPW Pro
now costs $195 as opposed to $295. The ETO bundle, which includes
MPW Pro, Symantec C++ for Power Macintosh,  Inside Macintosh
etc. is down to $595 from $795.

For PowerPC-based developers, the most interesting parts of the
new releases would appear to be MrC/MrCpp 1.0 - new optimised C
and C++ compilers for Power Macs. Apple is claiming "considerably
faster runtime performance compared with other popular compilers"
and in the labs, with a following wind the company claims "up  to
25% improvement", though without knowing what they are comparing
it with, that's pretty meaningless.

The company has also included an early development release of
"MrPlus:, described as  a new performance tuning environment to
help accelerate native Power Macintosh applications. The utility
monitors runtime execution of an application and then rearranges
code to make best use of the processor instruction cache and
reduce the number of page faults in a system with virtual memory
enabled. It can also be used as a profiling and code coverage
tool.

MacApp has also been tweaked up to version 3.3, and includes, for
the first time  integrated support for Open Scripting
Architecture, Drag- and-Drop, and PowerTalk  mailers.

                JAVA TOOLS BURGEON ON POWER MAC
                    - DESPITE LACK OF BROWSER

The Power Macintosh finds itself in the odd position of being
well supplied with tools for writing Java applets, while end-
users still have no way of running them. Metrowerks, having just
launched version 8 of its Codewarrier development tool says it
will add a suite of Java development tools code-named Wired in
the May 1996 release.

Meanwhile  Arch-rival Symantec is promising a free Java upgrade
this quarter, for existing users of its C++ compiler. Symantec
Cafe, formerly codenamed 'Expresso' includes an integrated Class
Browser that allows developers to browse and edit Java methods,
data, and classes; Source- code level debugging for Java code; a
programmer's editor and full support for AppleScript. There's no
word of any runtime module that will let Macintosh-based
developers actually test the results, however. Symantec is using
Sun's own Java compiler at the heart of Cafe.

But the first company off the blocks with a real product is
Cambridge Massachusetts-based Natural Intelligence Inc which has
begun shipping Roaster (is there no end to the coffee-related
puns?) - a $390  Java development environment. NI has its own
Java compiler, but also enables the use of Sun's own code for
people worried about complete compliance.

The company is claiming the package as the most complete Java
development environment available. In addition to the compiler,
there is a Java class disassembler a code editor and a project
window for easy manipulation of class files. Notably, Roaster
also includes an applet runner for testing and debugging the
finished Java applets.

What's still missing is a general Mac-based Web browser capable
of executing the finished Java applets. Netscape Communication
Corp is still struggling to get the Java interpreter working in
the Macintosh implementation of its Navigator, the latest beta
release, version 2.06ba still lacks Java support.  A Netscape
spokesperson said that the company was on schedule to have a
finished Java-enable browser within the next 6 weeks, however
there is unlikely to be any extended public beta programme as has
been seen with the Windows version, he said.

          NEW WAVE OF EMBEDDED AND REAL TIME SOLUTIONS

With this new report, High-End (32-bits and higher) RTOS Market
Sizing and Market Analysis Industry Report, International Data
Corporation (IDC) and First Technology Inc. (FTI) have
collaborated to provide a deeper understanding of embedded and
real time software.  This report enlarges upon embedded software
to create the enhanced framework for real time operating systems
(RTOSs) of:

*    Self-hosted, comprised of Unix and non-Unix
*    Host/Target
*    Roll-your-own/In-house developed
*    General purpose OSs, comprised of DOS/Windows/NT and Unix

The software industry for embedded and real time solutions has
been small in comparison to the larger semiconductor, boards and
systems suppliers.  But embedded software continues as a
linchpin.  Now as there are more public companies, lead by
Integrated Systems and Wind River, consolidations that have
brought larger companies into the market with Mentor acquiring
Microtec Research, and defense companies implementing technology
transfer, the software market is building the necessary business
and technology infrastructure for a robust industry.

                          Market Sizing

This report forecasts significant growth within the RTOS market.
On a unit basis the report presents embedded and real time unit
shipment estimates for RTOSs that increase from 23 million units
in 1994 to 140 million units in 1998, at a 57% compound annual
growth rate (CAGR).  The bar chart on the
http://apt.usa.globalnews.com/powerpc/ web site presents the RTOS
unit growth.

As a result of downward pressures on average selling prices
(ASPs), the RTOS revenue growth as discussed and forecast in the
report is not at the same level as the unit shipments.  On a
dollar basis the RTOS market is forecast to increase from $383
million in 1994 to $970 million in 1998, at a 27% CAGR growth.
The bar chart on the http://apt.usa.globalnews.com/powerpc/ web
site presents this revenue dollar RTOS growth.

The report analysis presents forecasts in the categories:

*    finer detail of RTOS discrimination
*    geographic distribution by North America, Western Europe,
     Japan, and rest of world
*    industry vertical market segmentation
*    competitive vendors shares

This is a continuing report in the embedded and real time series.
The next analysis reports, soon to be released, focus on tools
for the development of embedded and real time software and the
merchant boards market.

CHIRON AWARDS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE CONTRACT
TO SEPRAGEN FOR LARGE-SCALE PURIFICATION SYSTEMS

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNZ, SPGNA, SPGNW), of
San Leandro, CA, has signed a contract to build multiple
QuantaSep LS (large-scale) systems for Chiron Corporation. The
contract, valued at approximately $400,000, includes hardware,
software, documentation and validation. The systems have been
designed to meet the specific needs of Chiron's drug
manufacturing efforts.  Delivery is scheduled for January
1996.

"The interactive team efforts between Sepragen and Chiron
engineers resulted in the custom design of the process
purification systems. These will enable the rapid purification
of large quantities of two new potential Chiron drugs for
their clinical trial needs," said Vinit Saxena, president and
chairman.

"This is part of our overall strategic plan to provide
state-of-the-art, large-scale purification systems to
biopharmaceutical companies to enhance and optimize their
manufacturing processes.

"We selected Sepragen for this purchase based on the
exceptional service that they have provided to us in the
past," said Mark Pemberton, director of Bulk Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing at Chiron Corporation.

The QuantaSep LS is a large-scale, computer-controlled
chromatography workstation consisting of hardware,
electronics, software, sensors and detectors.

"Sepragen's advanced technologies have added significant
economic value to the manufacturing processes of many FDA
approved pharmaceutical drugs worldwide," Saxena said.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the field of large-scale
chromatography - the next generation technology in the
separations field. The company markets a patented radial flow
chromatography (RFC) technology that utilizes a novel
hydrodynamic column design in which the flow is directed
radially from the outside to the center of the column. The
surface areas are larger and the radial flow path (bed depth)
is shorter. The combination of these features results in
higher flow rates, lower back pressures, and increased
volumetric productivity over traditional axial columns. This
is further magnified in large-volume chromatography
applications.

Sepragen also markets computer-controlled process
chromatography workstations and process technology to the
biotechnology, food and environmental industries. The
company's products are being used by leading biotech
companies to reduce manufacturing costs and commercial
production time to market, as well as by food and
environmental companies to produce new value-added products
and processes. Based in San Leandro, California, the company
markets its proprietary RFC technology and services worldwide.

TRENDS IN BRIEF...

THE TREND TOWARD OUTSOURCING MAY TURN INTO A NETWORK
management headache.  When large customers pass the wide
area networking buck to carriers, they lose the ability
to monitor and test the complete net, pointed out Scott
Magee, a SystemView for AIX consultant.  IBM and other
companies need to work closely with the carriers to
ensure that their management systems stay useful...
IBM's many write-offs for restructuring and other costs
may be bad for investors, Wood Struthers Vice Chairman
Stanley Nabi told The Wall Street Journal.  Nabi said
IBM's book value is lower than it was 12 years ago...
Viking Components yesterday released memory upgrades for
IBM ThinkPads.  The modules come in 4M, 8M, and 16M and
are priced from $60 to $75 per megabyte.

scheduled for general availability in February.  Other
analysts pointed out that Lotus' more more mature
product, Notes Release 4, already has a running start
against Microsoft Exchange Version 1 Release 1.

Notes 4 promises greater functionality and ease of use
over Notes 3.  Calling it the convergence of messaging
and groupware, Lotus outlined the benefits of its fourth-
generation product:

* Object store: Documents and objects can be stored,
managed, and retrieved through links or direct user
manipulation.  The object store does not distinguish
between messages and other objects.

* Security: Additional security beyond password security
and digital signatures is rolled into Notes 4.  Further
security is required to manage access to the object
store, as well as to the individual objects and fields
within that database.

* Mobile support: Notes 4 users will have access to
messages, as well as to objects that have been linked to
those messages.  Notes 4 supports database replication
directly to individual client laptops and remote
desktops.

* Manageability: Manageability requirements are expanded
to include replication.  The client/server architecture
of the integrated messaging and groupware requires that
fourth generation systems provide robust tools for the
centralized management of servers, messages, and object
stores, as well as routers and server tasks.

* Directories: Notes 4 extends the directory to encompass
configuration, authentication/security, and customized
site-specific information.

* Transport and routing: These services are expanded to
transport and route loosely structured documents that
typify fourth generation objects.  Also, Notes 4 has
native support for X.400 and SMTP-MIME transports to
ensure interoperability with international inter-
enterprise communication standards.  Message and document
routing are dynamic, with routing paths that are
alterable on the basis of message urgency to link
availability.

* Migration facilities: Notes 4 migration facilities
allow system administrators and users to migrate at their
own pace and support coexistence among multiple
generations of messaging systems.

ABOUT FACE FOR INTERFACE

Across the board, analysts were most impressed with Notes
4's new and improved interface.  Lotus completely
redesigned its interface, explained Mark Levitt, senior
analyst for electronic messaging for International Data
Corp. (Framingham, Mass.).  "It connects cc:Mail to Notes
through a shared interface," he said.  "As a mail-based
interface, it makes it much easier for cc:Mail users to
use Notes."

The interface is the most important aspect of Notes 4,
Levitt said.  "Notes has always had a great deal of
functionality that has gone unrecognized or unused by
most users," he said.  "Not all users need that amount
of functionality, but the interface makes it simpler and
easier for cc:Mail users to move to Notes.

"Notes 4 goes several steps beyond what cc:Mail is
today," Levitt continued.  "That is not to say that Lotus
is planning to get rid of cc:Mail, but they're making the
migration path to Notes easier."

Vince Carahaly, president of NetExperts Inc. (Exton,
Penn.) and beta customer of Notes 4 on Windows NT for a
month and a half, agreed that the interface was a key
improvement in Notes 4.

"The biggest complaint about Notes 3 was that the e-mail
interface wasn't very good -- even though this was the
company with the award-winning cc:Mail product," Carahaly
said.  "With Notes 4, Lotus gave the e-mail interface the
look and feel of cc:Mail."

Apart from the new interface, Notes 4 improved its
database replication.  Notes 4 supports field-level
replication, while Notes 3 only supported document-level
or record-level replication, Carahaly explained.

For example, a Notes user can have a personnel file with
all the information on an employee and perhaps a bitmap
with a photo ID of the person.  With record-level
replication, if one part of that file changes -- for
instance, the employee's phone number -- the Notes user
must replicate the whole thing.  At field level, the user
can get in and change the phone number.  "It's much more
granular," he said.  "It's more efficient, faster, and
there's less data to ship over."

RELEASE 4 VERSUS RELEASE 1

Even without the one month head start over Microsoft,
Lotus is still in a better position with Notes 4 than
Microsoft is with Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.
"Notes is an established product.  It's a mature
generation of product -- that's their head start right
off the bat," he said.

In addition, Notes 4 is a more robust environment than
Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.  "Microsoft Exchange
is not workflow -- it's just client/server mail," he
said.  "Notes is a workflow product with client/server
mail."

"Shops that have Notes probably won't switch to Microsoft
Exchange," Carahaly said.  "Many companies are waiting
to see how good Notes 4 actually is.  Once it gets into
the market and people find that it has no problems, does
what it says it does, the improvements are there and
functioning -- it will be a hit."

Another analyst agreed that Notes 4 is a large
improvement over Notes 3.  "Notes 4 is a great leap
forward," said Tom Austin, research director with the
Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "Notes 4 put in place
a real integrated development environment."

Austin also praised the new mail interface.  "Notes 4 has
brought management of communications to the point where
mere mortals can do it," he said.  In addition, Notes 4
has improvements in scalability.  "With Notes 4, a server
can support five to ten times more people versus Notes
3," he said.  "This greatly reduces the cost of
management."

JAVA JOCKEYING

Notes 4 contains the programming language Lotus Script.
"Lotus Script obsoletes Notes macros," Austin said.
Despite the recent announcements that both IBM and
Microsoft will support Java and Java Script, Austin said
neither company will abandon their own script languages.
"Java Script won't rule the world," he said.  "But both
IBM and Lotus will support Java."

Although Austin said he was very impressed with Notes 4,
he said the release should have been on the market one
and a half years ago.  "Lotus does not have a track
record for accelerated development," he said.  "Notes 4
came three years after Notes 3.  If it takes Lotus three
more years to come out with Notes 5, it will be looking
at the pack from the back."

IBM PC COMPANY -- PAST AND PRESENT

IBM's PC Company underwent its share of restructuring and
changes in 1995, and most industry observers said its new
direction is a positive step forward.  They also offered
some ideas about what improvements the Big Blue unit can
make in 1996.

KILL OS/2

Analysts shook their heads and wrung their hands over
IBM's continued devotion to its maligned operating
system, OS/2.

"I'm surprised that [IBM Chairman Louis] Gerstner has
allowed OS/2 to continue this long," said Francie
Mendelsohn, president of Summit Research Associates
(Rockville, Md.).  "IBM has thrown millions of dollars
into this and not seen a return."

Although Mendelsohn said OS/2 is an excellent product,
she said the market share is so small that it will not
benefit IBM in any way.  "Maybe 1996 will be the year
that IBM totally gives up the ghost of OS/2," she said.

Another analyst agreed that OS/2 is technologically
brilliant but not worthwhile.  "IBM has to disentangle
itself from ventures like OS/2 because that continues to
drag them into the ground," said Steve Kleynhans, program
director of workgroup computing strategies for the META
Group (Stamford, Conn.).

IBM needs to position itself a leader, Kleynhans said.
"But it's a fine line between surrounding themselves with
new and glorious technology and wandering into the
weeds," he said.  "Lately IBM has been wandering
away -- with things like its Micro Channel and OS/2.
These are things the industry didn't really want -- IBM
needs to do innovative things without alienating
themselves from the industry."

SWIMMING IN THE CHANNEL

Analysts praised the PC Company's move away from direct
selling of its PCs to bringing resellers into the
picture.  "IBM must pursue an indirect channel strategy
to effectively compete in the commoditized PC industry,"
said Joseph Ferlazzo, an analyst with WorkGroup
Technologies (Hampton, N.H.).

Ferlazzo credited Robert Stephenson, the new head of the
PC Company, with the indirect channel strategy.
"Stephenson was probably one of the people who pushed
that through," he said.  "There have been a lot of good
moves since Stephenson's been on board."  As a former
salesman, Stephenson recognizes that IBM can no longer
play in the direct channel and that the company needs to
give its channels enough margin to make it profitable for
them to sell IBM products, he said.

"The big question is: Can IBM provide the necessary
margin to their resellers without losing more money in
the PC Company?" Ferlazzo said.  "It's too early to tell
whether it will work."

Although Ferlazzo said IBM has lived up to its end of the
bargain with its resellers by creating a high presence
for the IBM name in advertising and public relations
activities.  "IBM is doing its job of creating brand
recognition.  Look at all the Aptiva commercials," he
said.

But Kleynhans said the IBM name has lost much of its
luster.  "The IBM name still carries a certain cachet,
but not like it did before," he said.  "IBM's biggest
challenge is to differentiate [itself] in a market where
[it's] no longer the overriding leader."

CLONE THINKPAD SUCCESS

"IBM still makes the best notebook out there with their
ThinkPads," said Mendelsohn.

"IBM needs to find a way to clone its ThinkPad success
for its desktop and server lines," agreed Kleynhans.  IBM
still lacks exciting products in its desktop or server
lines, but this winter the company is poised to introduce
some interesting products, he said.

Mendelsohn praised IBM's move to beef up its Aptiva line.
"Originally it was only a 60 MHz machine -- that's
underpowered even for the home market," she said, adding
that IBM needs to focus more on the home market.  "The
home market will probably account for half of the PCs
sold.  That market is booming."

INVENTORY UNDER CONTROL

At least the PC Company has made strides with its
inventory issues, Ferlazzo said.  "Its build-to-order
strategy is clear and underway," he said.  "Its
manufacturing strategy is strong."

Stephenson's predecessor, Richard Thoman, put in place
a process for daily updates on the amount of orders
received and the number of PCs made, which made
management and inventory issues much easier, Ferlazzo
explained.  "IBM is not having these critical issues of
inventory," he said.  "Manufacturing is no longer a
hindrance."

"The problem is the business model.  The PC Company is
just breaking even, if that," Ferlazzo said.  "The
biggest challenge for Stephenson is making the PC Company
a profitable entity."

IBM'S INET TO SPARK INTERNET APPLICATIONS

Application developers can now "test drive" their
Internet applications in a driving course sponsored by
IBM.  IBM announced an iNet porting extension to its
Solution Partnership Center (SPC) in San Mateo, Calif.

The SPC uses the IBM RS/6000 platform, running IBM's
version of Unix, AIX.  The iNet porting facility provides
developers with access to systems, support, and
tools -- either over the Internet or in person at the
SPC.

"We intend to make the RS/6000 the Internet server of
choice," said Tom Fornoff, director of workstation
marketing for IBM's RS/6000 Division.  "We're confident
that developers using this facility will realize the
advantages in performance and flexibility that the
RS/6000 offers."

INET OFFERINGS

The iNet porting facility's complete list of resources,
free to developers (as available), include:

* An iNet porting World Wide Web (WWW) home page at
http://www.spc.ibm.com that provides information on the
center and how to use its resources

* Internet access to a number of RS/6000 systems running
AIX, allowing developers to test drive the platform and
experience its Internet server capabilities

* Scheduled, secure Internet access to a range of RS/6000
servers, software development tools, and technical
support that let developers port or create Internet
applications for the RS/6000 platform

In addition, developers can use the latest RS/6000
uniprocessor, symmetric multiprocessor, and scalable
POWERparallel systems (RS/6000 SP).  IBM development
tools will also be available.  These include products
from IBM and third parties like BlueStone, Illustra
Information Technologies, Lotus, Netscape, Prodigy,
Progressive Networks, RAD Technologies, Spyglass, VDOnet,
Verity, Worlds, Xing Technology, and others.  These
vendors will also provide technical support and training.

Marketing support is also available for Internet
applications created for or ported to the RS/6000
platform.  Marketing support includes a listing on a "Hot
Internet Applications" Web page directory on the SPC's
home page; marketing links with IBM channels, product
divisions, and the Industry Solution Units.

BOON TO BIG BLUE, DEVELOPERS

Industry observers were excited about IBM's announcement
and said the iNet porting facility is a boon to both IBM
and developers.  "This allows IBM to immediately allow
developers to begin testing code, testing new market
ideas -- without building an infrastructure of corner
stores," said Rich Doherty, a director of The
Envisioneering Group (Seaford, N.Y.).

Doherty described IBM's iNet porting facility as a
"virtual service bureau," but said developers who still
want the security and sanctity of testing their
applications in person can take their applications to the
facility in San Mateo.

The Envisioneering Group has accessed the site and built
ports on IBM's supercomputers.  "There's nothing else
like it," Doherty said.  "You can call into the heart of
the technology, try out ideas in private, and have access
to thousands of dollars of development time."

TRY BEFORE THEY BUY

Not only can developers test out their applications,
developers can bring their clients in and walk through
the applications with them to work through any problems,
Doherty explained.  "This is a `try before they buy' set
up," he said.  "You couldn't ask for a better match of
customer and vendor."

Other companies may try to copy elements of IBM's iNet
porting facility, but Doherty said IBM gives developers
lots of access to its system.  "These things are usually
portioned out in terms of minutes, not in terms of tens
of hours," he said.  "IBM has dozens of ports to ensure
that each developer has 22 continuous hours.

"That's unique -- that's not just driving the car around
the block, that's like borrowing it from the dealer for
a weekend," Doherty said.

DATA RULES

Another analyst agreed that IBM's interest in Internet
applications is good for the company.  "IBM has a point
of leverage in this new environment -- it's called data,"
said John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.).

IBM has huge amounts of data, mostly on its back-end
systems, Robb explained.  "IBM wants to help companies
distribute or publish or integrate that data with their
Web offerings," he said.  "So anything that IBM can offer
in the way of tool sets is positive.

"Everyone wants to Web-enable their legacy systems," Robb
said.  "IBM should be in the business of helping
companies do that."

IBM TO EXPAND RMON SUPPORT

Although IBM has supported RMON for some time, the
company is introducing extensions to the network
monitoring standard across its hub products starting in
the next few months.

The extensions include two probe modules, one designed
to resemble the RMON 2 standard once it is finalized and
another to generate test traffic on a local area network.
Right now, IBM has only one probe capable of performing
these functions: an Ethernet probe for its 8250 Nways
intelligent hub which can monitor three Ethernet segments
simultaneously.

In the coming months, IBM will announce these
capabilities for the 8260, at the top of IBM's line, said
Sallie Matlack, an IBM-certified IT specialist.  Lesser
IBM hubs will receive these extensions sometime in the
future.

RMON (remote network monitoring) is an industry-standard
method of collecting statistical data at the physical and
data layers of network segments and sending the data back
to a central site for analysis.  RMON-compliant probes
can also detect problems and send warnings to the
management station.

RMON 2 will expand the range of data that can be
gathered, looking at higher functions such as network
protocols and applications, and will provide an end-to-
end view.

IBM's Enterprise Communications Analysis Module (ECAM)
is a block of software that looks at the same things RMON
2 will when the standard is complete.  IBM has created
a mechanism where ECAM can be automatically downloaded
from a management station into a probe that has been
engineered to accept modules like ECAM.

IBM's other RMON extension, called Traffic Transmission
Management Module (TTMM), can take network traffic
collected through other monitoring tools and spit it out
onto a local segment.  This lets network managers monitor
the impact on that segment via performance monitoring
tools.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER

To handle the information gathered through RMON probes,
IBM last October introduced a version of its software
product Nways Campus Manager - ReMon, a version that
includes ECAM and TTMM.  In November, IBM brought the
software from NetView for AIX to HP OpenView.

ReMon lets managers tell the distributed agents which
packets to capture and send back to the management
platform.  It also displays the information gathered from
the probes graphically.

IDC FORECASTS A GLOOMY 1996 FOR THE INDUSTRY

In spite of a bullish 10-year outlook for on-line
commerce, researcher International Data Corp. (IDC)
yesterday predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment
as investors and corporations suffer through the
discouragingly slow development of a significant consumer
base.

By this time next year, IDC predicted 20 percent of the
Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web sites will
close or stop maintaining them, resulting in "ghost"
sites.

On-line information service providers (such as
CompuServe, America Online, Microsoft Network, and
Prodigy) will derive more than half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis,
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point."

Gens also said IT industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate
spending on IT will rise from 2 percent of revenues to
more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC said it believes
on-line commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more by
the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers, and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."

INTERNET APPLIANCES

By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of "Internet appliances" -- low-cost devices that allow
the user to access on-line information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500, Gens said.  They
will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The game
console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing for
simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years, Internet
Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than $100 to
free) by businesses that want customers to access their
on-line services, according to Gens.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicted that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to $20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to $15 per month within
the next two years, partially because cable companies
(with the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier, IDC said.

MICROSOFT

IDC predicted Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds."  One effect of the
Internet phenomenon of 1995 has been that many on Wall
Street and within the IT industry now are forecasting the
undoing of Microsoft's hold on the industry, and hailing
the rise of Netscape and Sun Microsystems as the new
industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," Gens
said.  "We also believe in spite of the recurring rumors
of Department of Justice investigations, Microsoft will
escape any major antitrust activity in 1996, an election
year.  Additionally, Microsoft will conclude that its
ventures into new businesses will have a greater chance
of success without the Microsoft brand."

OTHER PREDICTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR

* There will be an Internet-driven shakeout in the
application software and application development tools
businesses in 1996 and 1997.  The emergence of the Web,
and the growing importance of entertaining,
multimedia-rich interfaces, will challenge the current
crop of client/server tool suppliers like Microsoft,
Powersoft, Dynasty, Forte, and Seer, as well as
application package companies like SAP and Peoplesoft.

* Software licensing will support network access and
short-term "rental."  Behind the scenes, suppliers are
currently exploring how to "crack the code"  on this
charging model; the leaders will begin experimenting in
the marketplace in 1996 and 1997.

* Large systems will become "politically correct."
High-end servers will increasingly be required to scale
to support direct access by thousands to potentially
millions of users, as opposed to today's hundreds to
thousands of corporate users.  This accelerated scaling
requirement will put pressure on Microsoft's enterprise
strategy due to NT's relatively low-end design point,
and boost the Unix camp's high-end business.
Beneficiaries will be IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun
Microsystems, and -- perhaps -- a rejuvenated Digital.

* The increased scope of the Net will favor suppliers
that excel in creating "virtual organizations."
Successful suppliers will be able to play well in a
"virtual organization"  structure -- able to act as
creator, investor, producer, and/or partner.

CAMBEX UNVEILS MAINFRAME DISK ARRAY

Cambex Corp. last month announced a high-performance disk
array subsystem that supports both IBM System/390
mainframe and client/server data storage requirements.

The Cascade XE (cross-enterprise) system provides high
availability and up to 272 gigabytes of storage in a
single DASD product.  The Cascade XE can be
simultaneously attached to an IBM mainframe 3990 disk
controller and to open systems platforms, including IBM
RS/6000 and SP2, SUN SPARC, Hewlett-Packard 9000 and
Microsoft's Windows NT.

Cambex also announced an XE Backup/Restore option which
supports the use of existing mainframe tape subsystems,
management tools, and procedures.  The software option
provides backup for both legacy and open systems storage.

The amount of storage in the Cascade XE available for
each platform is scalable, enabling the user to
reconfigure capacity levels to accommodate a gradual
transition from one operating environment to another
within the same disk array unit.

"FIREWALL" PROTECTION INCLUDED

Mainframe and open systems environments operate
independently and are isolated through an electronic
"firewall" that ensures data security and integrity.
Unlike other solutions, data paths and cache memories are
not shared between the different host environments,
thereby ensuring that data cannot be corrupted by
component failure or operator error.

A Cascade XE configured with 68G of RAID-1 mainframe DASD
and 68G of RAID-5 open systems storage is priced at
$265,000, or less than $1.95 per megabyte.  In a larger
configuration of 136G of mainframe and 136G of open
systems storage, the Cascade XE system is priced at
$475,000, or $1.75 per megabyte.

Since storage assigned to open systems platforms can be
connected to the IBM 3990 controller, the Cascade XE also
provides users with a cross-enterprise backup capability
under System/390 storage management facilities.  The XE
Backup/Restore option increases the use of existing
mainframe tape facilities by extending support to the
backup and restoration of open systems storage within the
Cascade XE subsystem.

SUN SCORES WELL IN PRICE/PERFORMANCE RUNNING
DB2 VERSION 2

Sun Microsystems Computer Co. announced the industry's
best-ever price/performance results for the Transaction
Processing Performance Council Benchmark C (TPC-C)
benchmark.

Sun's SPARCserver 1000E with eight 85 MHz SuperSPARC
processors, running IBM's DB2/a Version 2 database server
software on the Solaris 2.4 symmetric multiprocessing
(SMP) operating system, delivered results of 3255.88
transactions per minute (tpmC) at a price/performance of
$182 per tpmC.

The new performance results are the best-ever published
DB2 Version 2 performance figures and the first on a
non-IBM platform, demonstrating the commitment of IBM and
Sun to open industry standards.

According to Janet Perna, director of database technology
in IBM Software Solutions Division, "We are excited at
this opportunity to demonstrate IBM DB2 Version 2's
superior performance and reliability features on the Sun
Solaris system as part of this TPC-C benchmark.  This
demonstrates IBM's continuing commitment to making its
leadership database products available on all
high-performance platforms -- something our customers
require in order to maintain their competitive edge in
the marketplace."

The TPC-C benchmark simulates an order entry environment
for a warehouse operation.  The benchmark has gained
industry acceptance because it is considered to be
similar to "real world" processing. By simulating the
activities found in complex Online Transaction Processing
(OLTP) application environments, the TPC-C benchmark
exercises a system's breadth of components associated
with such environments.

SLOWDOWN TEMPORARY FOR WINDOWS 95; MEETS EXPECTATIONS

Although most analysts have downgraded their estimates
about the number of copies of Windows 95 that would sell
during 1996, the numbers are expected to pick up a bit
during the coming year.

Dataquest (San Jose, Calif.), for example, reduced its
Windows 95 forecast by 3.6 million, from 30 million to
26.4 million.  Dataquest now estimates that 16.4 million
copies of Windows 95 will be in consumers' hands by the
end of 1995 (the rest staying in the distribution
channel).

The lower forecast "is an artifact of forecasting a
product at a time when it was not yet in the market and
when the final shipment date had not been set," said
Dataquest principal analyst Paul Cubbage.

Estimates were downgraded for a variety of reasons.  One
is that many corporations have been particularly cautious
about upgrading from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95.
Companies are taking their time to make the decision
because moving to Windows 95 is expensive, both in terms
of money and the time it takes to learn the new operating
system, said Chris Le Tocq, president of Softracks
Software Research (Los Altos, Calif.).

"There have been two years of people trying to get
Windows 3.1 to work, and it works pretty well.  A lot of
organizations are now smart enough not to upgrade just
for upgrade's sake," he said.  Although companies view
Windows 95 as more reliable than Windows 3.1, they have
to evaluate whether it is worth the pain they anticipate
installation will cost them, he said.

When corporations buy a PC today, they have the option
of ordering it with Windows 95, Windows 3.1, or both, Le
Tocq explained.  Many are opting for both, and to date,
they are turning to Windows 3.1 because it is a known
quantity, he said.

Consumers also are not buying Windows 95 in the
quantities originally forecasted.  Cubbage attributed
this to the fact that consumers don't have as much to
spend and are not as optimistic about the economy as
anticipated.

The slowdown in sales of Windows 95 is temporary, Cubbage
said, because eventually, users will have no choice but
to use the operating system.  Cubbage predicted that
sales will pick up by the second or third quarter of
1996.

It is irrelevant whether Windows 95 penetration is up to
its aggressive predictions, because virtually every new
version of key application software products is being
written for Windows 95, and users aren't going to stop
advancing their software.  Eventually these applications
alone are going to move users to Windows 95, said Tom
Nolle, president of CIMI Corp. (Voorhees, N.J.).

MEETING EXPECTATIONS

All in all, Windows 95 has met expectations.

"I think it is pretty much on target," Cubbage said.  "It
is an improvement and doesn't break nearly as much as
Windows 3.1.  At least for me, it runs at about the same
speed as Windows 3.1."

Windows 95's ability to work with different types of
hardware and to control the hardware is better than
Windows 3.1's, but not nearly as foolproof as Microsoft
has claimed, Le Tocq said.  Despite the fact that it does
an outstanding job of detecting hardware and working with
it, there are key hardware platforms that it doesn't
detect, he said.

There is always a laundry list of things to fix when a
new piece of software enters the marketplace, and Windows
95 is no exception.  "When you have something new, you
discover maybe there are things you didn't spend as much
time on as you would have wished," explained Le Tocq.
"Maybe you provided for 300 network cards, and it turns
out the remaining 50 are really important to people.
That's pretty common."

There is widespread belief that Microsoft is preparing
a fix of Windows 95, which probably will hit the
marketplace in the second quarter of 1996.

But it wouldn't be prudent for Microsoft to spill the
beans about a fix during the lucrative holiday buying
season, Nolle said, because the effect would be to cut
Microsoft's current sales of Windows 95.

Le Tocq agreed.  "[The fix] probably will arrive with
very little fanfare so it won't disturb current sales.
When you have such high public exposure, you don't want
to announce a fix.  I wouldn't be surprised to see them
slip the fix into the boxes and keep shipping it, and
then tell people once there is enough of it in the
channel."

STATISTICS ABOUT WINDOWS 95

93% of those who have already purchased Windows 95 are
satisfied with it.
91% agree that Windows 95 was worth the expense.
90% said it was worth the time and effort it took to
install it.

88% said they would buy Windows 95 again.
86% said they would recommend Windows 95 to a friend or
colleague.

47% indicated they bought Windows 95 exclusively for home
use.
16% indicated they bought Windows 95 exclusively for work
use.
37% indicated they bought Windows 95 for both home and
work use.

26% said their main reason for buying it was to improve
previous platform/performance.
25% said it was to keep up with technology.
23% cited wanting the applications supported by Windows
95 as the reason for buying it.
13% said they bought Windows 95 because it was bundled
with the hardware.

FOR MICROSOFT IN 1996, UBIQUITY IS KEY

If Microsoft is to continue its domination of most major
computer technology sectors in 1996 and beyond, it must
shore up areas in which it has been traditionally weak
and continue along its path in areas in which it
dominates.

In 1996, Microsoft must enter any pockets of the
technology market that it hasn't already conquered, said
Tom Nolle, president of CIMI Corp. (Voorhees, N.J.).
"Any place the market might go that Microsoft isn't
already in is a potential risk for them.  To some degree,
Microsoft has to be everywhere," he said.  "A little leak
is all it takes.  Its position in the marketplace will
be easier to defend if there is no area of major weakness
because if there is, that may be enough for any company
to break Microsoft's hold on the market."

Microsoft should stick to what it knows best: commodity
desktop software, said Brian Jeffery, an analyst with
International Technology Group (Mountain View, Calif.).
"Microsoft seems to be doing fairly well on the desktop,
but anything above the desktop isn't flying very well.
For a few years, Microsoft suffered from the illusion
that it was something else, but it should stick with what
it knows best," he said.

For example, Microsoft's foray into the world of the
Internet may be misguided, Jeffery said.  Microsoft can
be divided into two businesses: the very stable and
profitable desktop software business, and a collection
of niche businesses, which, for Microsoft, is "science
fiction," he said.

"There is a lot of talk about Microsoft dominating the
Internet, but that is absolute rubbish," Jeffery said.
"It will never be a large percentage of their revenue.
They should stick to their core successes."

Although Internet-related business presents a lot of
possibilities for Microsoft in 1996, "there is just as
much of a possibility that it will cost a lot of money
as there is that Microsoft will make a lot of money,"
said William Zachmann, president of Canopus Research
(Duxbury, Mass.).

But Microsoft has the financial resources to try
different things in an effort to come up with the next
big thing, Zachmann said.  "But they are fishing.  If
you look at Microsoft Network, it was supposed to be a
big deal, and it is off to a limping start."

To maintain its edge in 1996, Microsoft must focus on
expanding its positions of traditional strengths into the
network and collaborative applications arena, which have
been areas of relative weakness for Microsoft, Nolle
said.

 "There are many things operating systems services can
logically be expected to do, and one is to provide the
basic tools for multisystem collaboration and to set a
developmental standard that would be used to build
applications like ATM to the desktop or videoconferencing
applications," he said.  In this area, Nolle explained,
Microsoft hasn't established a lock on the developer
community like it has in other areas.

ABOVE THE LAW?

Analysts generally agree that Microsoft's legal troubles
are pretty much behind them, at least in 1996.  Microsoft
is "walking a pretty well-defined path through the
minefield, and unless they do something cocky and stupid,
I think they are fairly safe," Nolle said.

The Justice Department has not been unduly harsh with
Microsoft, but there may still be some rumblings in the
halls of Justice.  "I would tend to view any substantial
intervention by the Justice Department as a wild card
rather than something I would confidently anticipate,"
Zachmann said.

But despite the fact that Microsoft's path to success
legally is fairly well-defined, it isn't impossible that
company officials may get myopic, so immersed in its
culture that they lose sight of how the company is
perceived.  That could spell trouble for Microsoft by
1997, Nolle predicted.

"Microsoft needs to think about the things that IBM and
AT&T have faced: the question of a preemptive strike to
reduce the legal pressure," Nolle said.  "AT&T and IBM
both came to the conclusion that they were better off
accepting a self-imposed change that diffused the legal
activity."

1997 AND BEYOND

By the end of 1996, Microsoft will be more firmly
established in the applications area than ever because
of IBM's acquisition of Lotus and Novell's divestiture
of WordPerfect.  Those actions have basically demolished
competition for Microsoft in those key application areas,
Nolle said.  "Microsoft is going to run rampant in
applications in 1996," he predicted.

But Microsoft could experience a setback in market
leadership, industry dominance and market command either
this year or next, Zachmann warned.  "I've been
anticipating a setback for Microsoft for some time now,
but it hasn't happened yet.  One of these quarters,
Microsoft's earnings are going to fall, and that could
precipitate the setback.  To continue on its growth
track, Microsoft has to keep coming up with lots of
earnings gains, and that gets tougher and tougher to do."

MSNBC BRINGS MICROSOFT ONE STEP CLOSER
TO TECHNOLOGY DOMINATION

Last month, Microsoft and NBC struck a deal to create a
news service that will inform viewers across broadcast,
cable and the Internet.  The revolutionary news service,
dubbed MSNBC, is designed to take advantage of NBC's
newsgathering expertise and Microsoft's strength in
computer technology, both through its software and its
fledgling on-line service, Microsoft Network.

As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said when the deal was
announced, people want to be able to call up news on
demand at their convenience.  While watching breaking
news on television, consumers want to be able to get
access to more in-depth information on items of interest.
The deal with NBC will help create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience, he
explained.

The deal calls for Microsoft to invest $220 million over
five years for a 50 percent stake in the all-news cable
station.  Both Microsoft and NBC will invest $200 million
over five years to fund the cable channel and a
supporting on-line service.

Areas of special interest for Microsoft include
interactive television and on-line computer services,
both of which will be incorporated into the MSNBC
venture.

Gates apparently wanted to enter the news business very
badly: when a deal to acquire a large stake in Turner
Broadcasting Service went awry last August, Microsoft got
back in the saddle and spent the next several months
contemplating and executing a plan to get what it wanted.
With the MSNBC deal, it may have done just that.

A BETTER PLAN

The MSNBC venture is a much better way to go than
Microsoft's previous idea, which was to form its own news
organization, said Peter Krasilovsky, an analyst with
Arlen Communications Inc. (Bethesda, Md.).  Microsoft had
hired more than 20 reporters, who would form the genesis
of what might have been Microsoft's unique news
organization.

But the current plan allows Microsoft to have a buffer.
"Not only does Microsoft get to provide state-of-the-art
news, but it also doesn't get taken to task as a news
agency, which might have been very difficult from a
corporate point of view," Krasilovsky said.

The MSNBC venture will have to prove that there is a
market for people who want to customize this type of
information, said Peter Bernstein, president of
InfoNautics Consulting Inc. (Ramsey, N.J.).  "I think
there is a small segment of the population that would be
interested in doing that, but the question is whether
they will be willing to pay a stiff price for it," he
said.  "Will the perceived value be there for the service
to get the kind of penetration it will need to be
successful?"

At this point, it is difficult to envision that people
who are accustomed to getting information one way will
change their behavior so radically as to heavily use the
service MSNBC plans to provide, Bernstein said.  "But
Microsoft and NBC have plenty of money, and if they want
to back it to the extent that it will probably need to
be backed to change people's behavior, they can do it.
It's a question of marketing, and Microsoft has proven
itself very good at marketing."

By entering into this deal, Microsoft is covering all
bases, trying to position itself as a premier content
provider.  This agreement, along with Microsoft Network
and Microsoft's strong interest in interactive
television, is Microsoft's move into the real-time
content business.  "They honestly believe that content
is going to be king in the future," and Microsoft wants
to own a large part of that empire, Bernstein said.

Content is key, agreed Jim Penhune, an analyst with BIS
Strategic Decisions (Norwell, Mass.).  Microsoft has made
many alliances for content, including the defunct deal
with Turner Broadcasting and its relationship with SKG
Dreamworks.

A STEPPING STONE TO INTERACTIVE TV?

Some say that providing on-demand news is an interim step
toward gaining a foothold in the interactive television
market.  Microsoft is hoping that MSNBC will be the
interactive TV vehicle for news information, some
believe.

"You can't go wrong with content because all of it is
fairly leveragable," Penhune explained.  "A year ago, or
even now, there is a lot of talk about [deals like this]
giving Microsoft content for interactive TV.  But even
if it doesn't, it gives them content for all these other
media as well, so it isn't like they are going to be
stuck with something they can't use."

Although projects like the MSNBC venture take plenty of
Microsoft's energy and money, they will not distract
Microsoft from its core projects, Penhune said.  Those
core projects are all targeted at the consumer market,
"and if you accept the premise that they are consumer-
and not business-oriented, then doing something like this
is not a distraction.  It is another way of addressing
the consumer market," he said.

NOTES 4 BEATS MICROSOFT EXCHANGE TO MARKET

Lotus Development Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.) hailed in
Notes Release 4 along with the new year.  Many industry
observers said Lotus' timing is well-aimed to beat out
its primary competition: Microsoft Exchange, scheduled
for general availability in February.  Other analysts
pointed out that Lotus' more more mature product, Notes
Release 4, already has a running start against Microsoft
Exchange Version 1 Release 1.

Notes 4 promises greater functionality and ease of use
over Notes 3.  Calling it the convergence of messaging
and groupware, Lotus outlined the benefits of its fourth-
generation product:

* Object store: Documents and objects can be stored,
managed, and retrieved through links or direct user
manipulation.  The object store does not distinguish
between messages and other objects.

* Security: Additional security beyond password security
and digital signatures is rolled into Notes 4.  Further
security is required to manage access to the object
store, as well as to the individual objects and fields
within that database.

* Mobile support: Notes 4 users will have access to
messages, as well as to objects that have been linked to
those messages.  Notes 4 supports database replication
directly to individual client laptops and remote
desktops.

* Manageability: Manageability requirements are expanded
to include replication.  The client/server architecture
of the integrated messaging and groupware requires that
fourth generation systems provide robust tools for the
centralized management of servers, messages, and object
stores, as well as routers and server tasks.

* Directories: Notes 4 extends the directory to encompass
configuration, authentication/security, and customized
site-specific information.

* Transport and routing: These services are expanded to
transport and route loosely structured documents that
typify fourth generation objects.  Also, Notes 4 has
native support for X.400 and SMTP-MIME transports to
ensure interoperability with international inter-
enterprise communication standards.  Message and document
routing are dynamic, with routing paths that are
alterable on the basis of message urgency to link
availability.

* Migration facilities: Notes 4 migration facilities
allow system administrators and users to migrate at their
own pace and support coexistence among multiple
generations of messaging systems.

ABOUT FACE FOR INTERFACE

Across the board, analysts were most impressed with Notes
4's new and improved interface.  Lotus completely
redesigned its interface, explained Mark Levitt, senior
analyst for electronic messaging for International Data
Corp. (Framingham, Mass.).  "It connects cc:Mail to Notes
through a shared interface," he said.  "As a mail-based
interface, it makes it much easier for cc:Mail users to
use Notes."

The interface is the most important aspect of Notes 4,
Levitt said.  "Notes has always had a great deal of
functionality that has gone unrecognized or unused by
most users," he said.  "Not all users need that amount
of functionality, but the interface makes it simpler and
easier for cc:Mail users to move to Notes.

"Notes 4 goes several steps beyond what cc:Mail is
today," Levitt continued.  "That is not to say that Lotus
is planning to get rid of cc:Mail, but they're making the
migration path to Notes easier."

Vince Carahaly, president of NetExperts Inc. (Exton,
Penn.) and beta customer of Notes 4 on Windows NT for a
month and a half, agreed that the interface was a key
improvement in Notes 4.

"The biggest complaint about Notes 3 was that the e-mail
interface wasn't very good -- even though this was the
company with the award-winning cc:Mail product," Carahaly
said.  "With Notes 4, Lotus gave the e-mail interface the
look and feel of cc:Mail."

Apart from the new interface, Notes 4 improved its
database replication.  Notes 4 supports field-level
replication, while Notes 3 only supported document-level
or record-level replication, Carahaly explained.

For example, a Notes user can have a personnel file with
all the information on an employee and perhaps a bitmap
with a photo ID of the person.  With record-level
replication, if one part of that file changes -- for
instance, the employee's phone number -- the Notes user
must replicate the whole thing.  At field level, the user
can get in and change the phone number.  "It's much more
granular," he said.  "It's more efficient, faster, and
there's less data to ship over."

RELEASE 4 VERSUS RELEASE 1

Even without the one month head start over Microsoft,
Lotus is still in a better position with Notes 4 than
Microsoft is with Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.
"Notes is an established product.  It's a mature
generation of product -- that's their head start right
off the bat," he said.

In addition, Notes 4 is a more robust environment than
Microsoft Exchange, Carahaly said.  "Microsoft Exchange
is not workflow -- it's just client/server mail," he
said.  "Notes is a workflow product with client/server
mail."

"Shops that have Notes probably won't switch to Microsoft
Exchange," Carahaly said.  "Many companies are waiting
to see how good Notes 4 actually is.  Once it gets into
the market and people find that it has no problems, does
what it says it does, the improvements are there and
functioning -- it will be a hit."

Another analyst agreed that Notes 4 is a large
improvement over Notes 3.  "Notes 4 is a great leap
forward," said Tom Austin, research director with the
Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "Notes 4 put in place
a real integrated development environment."

Austin also praised the new mail interface.  "Notes 4 has
brought management of communications to the point where
mere mortals can do it," he said.  In addition, Notes 4
has improvements in scalability.  "With Notes 4, a server
can support five to ten times more people versus Notes
3," he said.  "This greatly reduces the cost of
management."

JAVA JOCKEYING

Notes 4 contains the programming language Lotus Script.
"Lotus Script obsoletes Notes macros," Austin said.
Despite the recent announcements that both IBM and
Microsoft will support Java and Java Script, Austin said
neither company will abandon their own script languages.
"Java Script won't rule the world," he said.  "But both
IBM and Lotus will support Java."

Although Austin said he was very impressed with Notes 4,
he said the release should have been on the market one
and a half years ago.  "Lotus does not have a track
record for accelerated development," he said.  "Notes 4
came three years after Notes 3.  If it takes Lotus three
more years to come out with Notes 5, it will be looking
at the pack from the back."

MICROSOFT BACKS IEEE MULTIMEDIA CONNECTION/CONTROL
STANDARD

Microsoft last week threw its support behind the IEEE
1394 serial bus interface standard, indicating that it
would be adhered to in future releases of the company's
various Windows operating systems.

The standard enables high-performance multimedia
connections and control of business and consumer
electronic devices.  It offers high-speed communications
and fully supports isochronous real-time data services.
It also supports Plug and Play, allowing "hot plugging"
of up to 63 external peripherals for convenient system
reconfiguration by the user.  It allows peer-to-peer
device communication, such as communication between a
scanner and a printer, to take place without consuming
system memory and CPU resources.

For multimedia applications, the IEEE interface enables
real-time digital data transfer for audio and video
capture, editing and playback, as well as for distributed
multimedia applications such as desktop conferencing.
For example, users can easily transfer images from a
camcorder to a PC.  These images can be edited and
replayed on the PC or TV screen while users
simultaneously print color pictures.  For traditional
data storage, IEEE 1394 is faster and less expensive than
comparable SCSI interfaces, supporting data transfer
rates of 400 megabits per second and increasing in speed
in the future.

Microsoft also revealed that it has signed a letter of
intent with Sony Electronics Inc. to develop open device
driver interfaces (DDIs), APIs and an open host
controller interface for IEEE 1394.

Another letter of intent with Compaq Computer Corp. is
targeted at accelerating adoption of the IEEE 1394
high-speed serial interface as a standard in the PC
industry.  This includes defining an open host controller
interface specification.  Both efforts will be undertaken
in cooperation with the 1394 Trade Association.

"The IEEE 1394 interface is an enabling technology for
expanding PC connectivity to a greater range of devices
and to new classes of peripherals, such as consumer
entertainment appliances," said Brad Silverberg, senior
vice president of the personal systems division at
Microsoft, in a prepared statement.  "IEEE 1394 enables
PCs to play a central role in consumer entertainment
systems.  We are pleased to be working with the leading
companies in the consumer electronics industry to develop
the IEEE 1394 serial bus interface standard."

Microsoft, a member of the 1394 Trade Association, is
playing a leading role in developing and promoting an
open IEEE 1394 serial bus interface specification.
Microsoft hosted the IEEE 1394 meeting in July and will
be hosting a 1394 driver architecture design preview in
March 1996.

SUPPORT FOR IEEE 1394

Various hardware manufacturers have pledged support for
the 1394 specification, including Cirrus Logic, Conner
Peripherals, Digital Equipment Corp., Western Digital,
Texas Instruments and Adaptec.

Adaptec Inc., a provider of input/output solutions, plans
to supply high-speed 1394 solutions that will allow PC
applications to "speak" to home electronics devices such
as camcorders and set-top boxes and make applications
such as desktop video editing a reality.  Among the
markets and applications for 1394, according to Adaptec,
are digital video, home electronics, near-term computer
applications such as desktop video editing, and
convergence of PCs and home electronics.

IDC: MICROSOFT WILL DO WELL IN '96 --
BUT DARK CLOUDS HOVER OVER THE HORIZON

DISAPPOINTMENT, RETRENCHMENT FORECAST FOR '96 ELECTRONIC
Marketplace: Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds," according to market
researcher IDC.

In the overall electronic marketplace, 1996 will be a
year of disappointment as investors and corporations
suffer through the discouragingly slow development of a
significant consumer base, IDC predicts.

MICROSOFT'S LOOSENED GRIP

One effect of the Internet phenomenon of 1995, IDC said,
has been that many on Wall Street and within the IT
industry now are forecasting the undoing of Microsoft's
hold on the industry, and hailing the rise of Netscape
and Sun Microsystems as the new industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," IDC
researcher Frank Gens said.  "We also believe in spite
of the recurring rumors of Department of Justice
investigations, Microsoft will escape any major antitrust
activity in 1996, an election year.  Additionally,
Microsoft will conclude that its ventures into new
businesses will have a greater chance of success without
the Microsoft brand."

GLOOM AND DOOM

By this time next year, IDC predicts 20 percent of the
Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web sites will
close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost sites.


The leading online information service providers (e.g.,
Compuserve, America Online, Microsoft Network, Prodigy)
will derive more than one-half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point.

"Though we predict the overall growth in online
subscribers will continue to be very strong, we expect
1996 will show a high turnover rate as users underwhelmed
by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscription services and turn on their TVs," Gens said.
"Still, 1996 will be a strategic investment year for
businesses that expect to compete in the growing
electronic marketplace, because during the next five
years, the number of `wired' (i.e., online) users will
rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it will
exceed 1 billion."

Gens also predicts IT industry revenues will jump from
$500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and
corporate spending on IT will rise from 2 - 2.5 percent
of revenues to more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC
believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or
more by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."  Internet Appliances


By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of Internet Appliances -- low-cost devices that allow the
user to access online information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

"Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500," Gens said.
They will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The
game console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing
for simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years,
Internet Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than
$100 to free) by businesses that want customers to access
their online services.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicts that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to 20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to 15 per month within the
next two years, partially because cable companies (with
the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

HOME PC MARKET

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier.

DISASTER RECOVERY FOR INFORMATION: IS YOUR BUSINESS PREPARED?

      Recent bombings at New York's World Trade Center and in
London's financial district indicated the vulnerability of any
business' information technology. SECURITY TECHNOLOGY NEWS has
learned an evaluation of security operations at the World Trade
Center--including the security of technology applications--has
been underway for the past six weeks.  Results of the evaluation
could be available by July 1, John Horn of Kroll Associates of
New York told us.  Kroll is conducting the security analysis by
request of the building owners, the Port Authority of New Jersey
and New York.
      Disaster contingency planning and recovery of information
technology is one area a number of businesses have little
expertise, security experts say, and some businesses need to
smarten up.
      "Businesses need to recognize how quickly the information
technology environment is changing and the implications this has
for security and recovery," Keith Hearnden, said, who spearheaded
a recent study on the business perils of computer failure.
Hearnden, a lecturer on security management at the Loughborough
University in London, collaborated on the study with IBM and the
Computing Services Association to survey more than 3,000
businesses on disaster recovery plans for computer failure.
      The study, which was recently published by IBM's Business
Recovery Services, showed 13 percent of businesses waited 13-24
months before testing their contingency plans; 24 percent waited
7-12 months; and 30 percent waited four to six months before
testing plans.  The study also showed 31 percent had tested their
plans within three months.
      "It is imperative to ensure that the whole business can be
recovered rather than use central computing facilities.  If
customers and reputation are irreparably damaged, what is the use
of a fully operational information technology system," he said.
      "This means radically rethinking the approach to disaster
recovery.  It means identifying and accepting the level of
dependency of a business on information technology.  It means
tackling the issue head on and being prepared to use practices
which are capable of incorporating and responding to the very
latest developments in business developments.
      "Lest there remain any doubt about the importance of
protecting a business' information technology, consider the fact
that information technology's share of the overall capital stock
of U.S. corporations has jumped to 25 percent in key areas such
as communications, finance, business services, healthcare and
education,"  Hearnden said.
      "Contingency plans are usually prepared by IT [information
technology] staff and IT staffs are traditionally oriented toward
mainframes, Carole Allen of IBM's Business Recovery Services
said.  IBM and others recommend that firms carry out business
impact analyses as part of contingency planning so that they
understand thoroughly the impact and cost of the loss of
applications and then set recovery priorities. "A recovery plan
is only effective if it provides for all risk areas, is regularly
tested and takes account of the forces of change and adapts
accordingly," Allen said.
      Nearly 36 percent of employees were uprooted and many had to
work from home after the blast; 16 percent worked in offices on
temporary leases and 7 percent of the work was moved abroad,
according to a report by Contingency Planning Research in
Jericho, N.Y.
      Chi/Cor Information Management, a Chicago-based company
contacted by STN, provides software for companies to buy to set
up emergency response plans.  The software provides guidelines of
a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to include: project
organization; business impact analysis, security review, strategy
development, vital records backup and recovery, disaster recovery
plan development, and testing and maintenance. All of these
items have to be updated as the business grows and technology
changes.  "You have to protect equipment and people as well as
protect the longevity of your business by creating a recovery
plan," Heidi Ewell, marketing manager for Chi/Cor said.

STUDY - NO DETECTION TECHNOLOGY EXISTS FOR EXPLOSIVES

      An advisory board for the National Research Council recently
concluded that there is no single detection technology "that can,
by itself, provide a high probability of detection coupled with a
low false alarm rate that will reduce the threat of terrorism at
an acceptable cost to airport operations."
      The board recommended further examination of technologies
funded by the FAA for research and development and expects the
private industry will commercialize the results.
      The 85-page study, called, "Detection of Explosives for
Commercial Aviation Security," was submitted by the National
Materials Advisory Board to the Commission on Engineering and
Technical Systems with the National Research Council.  The board
conducted the study under contract with the Federal Aviation
Administration and asked the FAA to define the regulatory
strategy to be used for explosive detection devices and
encouraged the agency to encourage industry participation in the
rulemaking process.

Technology Developments

      The technologies under development have a high, medium or
low priority tagged onto them.  The high priority technologies
could be deployed within the next several years and they include:
      Thermal Neutron Activation (TNA)--low energy neutrons
captured by nitrogen atoms; provides detection capability against
larger quantities of highly energetic explosives with a high
nitrogen content.
      Dual Energy X-ray--alternating X-ray beams of high and low
energy levels producing two different images due to differences
between the photoelectric and Compton attenuation coefficients of
the different elements.  Looks for average atomic number, but not
a specific number.
      Extremely Low Dose X-ray--Produces images at a lower x-ray
level.
      Coherent X-ray Scattering--an X-ray diffraction that depends
on the crystal structure of the explosive.
      Dual Energy X-ray Computed Tomography--A computed tomography
image used as a map of the X-ray attenuation.
      Vapor/Particle Detection Devices--uses low vapor pressure of
plastic explosives. Technologies on a medium or low priority
include:  elastic neutron scattering; pulsed fast neutron
activation; photon activation; nuclear resonant absorption; fast
neutron associated particle and backscatter analysis X-ray.

The Future of Aviation Security Technology

      The future of aviation security technology was revealed in a
recent speech given by a scientific advisor of Civil Aviation
Security for the Federal Aviation Administration.  Dr. Lyle O.
Malotky told the aviation audience "changes in security
technology are both evolutionary--that it is an improvement to
something we are already doing, and revolutionary--a dramatic
departure from existing procedures and thinking."
      Malotky gave short-term and long-term solutions to improve
the quality of the aviation security system worldwide.
      Today, he said, a way to improve aviation security is to
meet the challenge of searching common consumer electronics for
hidden explosives. Commercially available explosive vapor
detection systems provide an increased level of protection when
screening electronics, he said. The complexity of assembly and
the vents accessing the interior of the electronics make them
attractive for this technology.
      Also, implement enhanced X-ray systems capable of
identifying the presence of organic materials mixed with
inorganic camouflage work well for the examination of
electronics. Unlike a traveler's suitcase, electronics contain
very little organic material, so the explosive stands out in the
background.

A Look to the Future of Aviation Security

      The future of aviation security is "transparent screening."
Without the knowledge or cooperation of passengers, their baggage
will automatically be searched for the tools of terrorism--
weapons and explosives.  Malotky said the magnitude of the
aviation industry--the 500 million people and one billion pieces
of luggage that fly every year in the United States--require
airlines to conduct these security functions automatically.
      Changes will be made in the aircraft cargo container design,
Malotky predicted.  Part of the challenge of explosive detection
is the small size of the explosive charge that may bring down a
commercial airliner.
      By changing the design of baggage containers and using high
strength composite materials, it will increase the blast
resistance of the aircraft while reducing the repair and
replacement cost of the baggage containers.
      Also, probing radiation will be routinely used to detect
explosives concealed in baggage in the next five to 10 years.  A
variety of approaches have been used and progress made in this
area. Typical of the anomaly detection approaches are various
dual energy X-ray, X-ray backscatter, X-ray tomography, magnetic
resonance, dielectric measurements, and thermal neutron systems.
More specific signatures detected by technologies like nuclear
quadruple resonance, X-ray diffraction, or fast neutron scatter
can improve false alarm rates. Malotky expects a final rule on
the type, quantity and reliability of an automated explosive
detection system will be published in the summer and systems will
undergo testing against the standards in late 1993.
      There must be cooperation between the air carrier, airports
and the FAA to implement future security aviation technology.
The air carriers and airports will implement these changes while
the FAA funds the aviation security research and requires the
technological innovations.
      "Something needs to be done today to implement the
technologies we have now even though they are not the ultimate
solution," he said. "Failure to put in place the best security
technology we have leaves the entire system vulnerable to
attack."  (National Academy Press, 800/624-6242.)

U.S. RANKS LOW IN TERRORIST INCIDENTS

      The State Department sent a clear message to members of
Congress in a recent report that while the United States held the
lowest number of reported international terrorist incidents,
state-sponsored terrorism should still be a concern for all
governments.
      "Despite progress and successes, the threat of terrorism,
particularly state-sponsored terrorism, is still serious,"
Laurence E. Pope, acting coordinator for counterterrorism, said
in the introduction of the annual report. In the coming decade,
"we will certainly face serious challenges from terrorism growing
out of ethnic, religious tensions around the world.  Our response
must be to maintain our vigilance, increase our capabilities and
further develop cooperation."
      The report, "Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1992" praised the
United States, its allies and the U.N. Security Council for its
diligence in increased awareness, vigorous counterterrorism
training and tougher attitudes toward terrorism.  The report
highlighted the Security Council's example of its tough
stance against terrorism in Libya's  bombing of two civilian
aircraft.

Security Council Toughens on Terrorism

      The report highlighted the example of the United Nations'
condemnation of Libyan terrorism and the imposition of sanctions
against that country to indicate the most significant change in
attitude. The U.N. Security Council voted for mandatory
sanctions against Libya for refusing to comply with terms.  The
sanctions included an arms and air embargo, a demand that Libyan
Arab Airlines offices be closed and a requirement that all states
reduce Libya's diplomatic presence abroad.  The U.N. Security
Council reviews the Libyan case every 120 days.
      "The United States, its allies and the U.N. Security Council
recognized the need to make governments pay who support, tolerate
and engage in international terrorism," Pope said.  The United
States currently lists Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and
Syria as state sponsors of terrorism.  This list is maintained in
accordance with an export administration act that imposes trade
and other restrictions on countries determined by the Secretary
of State that supports acts of international terrorism.  The list
is sent to Congress and countries can be added or deleted as
circumstances demand.

Three Aspects to the Decline in Terrorism

      In a list of reasons for the decline in terrorism, the State
Department cited these three aspects: end state-sponsored
terrorism; strengthen the rule of law; and refuse to reward
terrorists by making concessions.
      End state-sponsored terrorism.  State sponsorship refers to
governments that support, tolerate and engage in international
terrorism.  The United States, its allies and the United Nations
Security Council have recognized the need to make those
governments pay a significant price for sponsoring terrorism.
      Strengthen the rule of law.  The State Department said it
improved the judicial and law enforcement capabilities of other
nations that could be victims of terrorist acts. The State
Department has conducted training through its antiterrorism
training assistance program, and said it has improved the ability
of governments to pre-empt, to investigate and to prosecute
terrorists. In 1992, more than 1,125 senior officials from 25
countries received the training which totaled the number of
people trained to 14,000 from 75 countries. Refuse to reward
terrorists through concessions.  Third, by not making
concessions, the State Department obtained the release of the
last American hostages in Lebanon in late 1991, and Germany saw
two German relief workers freed in June 1992.  The abductors had
demanded the release of convicted Hizballah terrorists, but the
German government refused to meet this demand.

Report Distributed as Reference Guide

      The report, has been distributed to the Senate foreign
relations committee, House foreign affairs committee, the Senate
Judiciary Committee, and various other congressional committees
as a reference document, Mike Kraft, spokesman from the State
Department's office of counterterrorism, said.
      Last year, 361 international terrorist attacks were reported
against the United States; much lower than the 1991 figure of
567.  The State Department attributed the inflated 1991 figure to
a number of incidents during the Gulf War. The report also
indicated that in 1992, 40 percent of the incidents were directed
at U.S. citizens and property. Assessments of foreign countries
where significant terrorist acts occurred were included as well
as the previous year's activities of individuals, terrorist
groups or umbrella groups known to be responsible for the
kidnapping or death of any American citizen during the past five
years.
      An overview is given of other international terrorist
incidents in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle
East.  The report also talked about specific incidents in Angola,
Sudan, Afghanistan, India, Japan, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri
Lanka, Thailand, Germany, Greece, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom,
the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, Argentina,
Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Algeria, Egypt, Israel,
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Yemen.  The
highest number of incidents were in Latin America, Western Europe
and the Middle East. (State Department, 202/647-6575.)

VIDEOS OFFER TIPS ON INFORMATION SECURITY & DISASTER RECOVERY

      Boston-based Commonwealth Films offers videos to teach
corporations about information security and disaster recovery.
"As society continues to access people using high technology, the
database of a company will be its most valuable asset, Christine
Sullivan, president of Hawthorne Associates, told SECURITY
TECHNOLOGY NEWS.  Hawthorn Associates represents Commonwealth
Films.  Commonwealth's videos teach corporations how to safeguard
company information.  "If safeguards are not taken, a company is
vulnerable to disaster," Sullivan said, "and [a person's] job
could be on the line if nothing is done about respecting a
company's security."
      The videos teach every level of employee to respect a
company's computer and the company's proprietary information.
The videos, which cost $525 each, include:
     Back in Business: Disaster Recovery

     Mum's the Word: PC/LAN Security
     Under Wraps: Information Security
     Locking the Door: Computer Security
     Access Denied: Computer Crime (available at end of June)

Disasters Can Ruin a Business

      "The horrible statistic is that 72 percent of all businesses
hit by disaster, however defined, either fail outright or within
three years.
      "There's a need for videos that teach company planning for
how you're going to handle a disaster, not as a bureaucratic
hurdle but as the survival of your business,"  Sullivan told
Kathleen Silvassy, Editor of VIDEO MARKETING NEWS, our sister
newsletter.
      "A growing concern among companies is that we're in the
information technology age as manufacturing declines, and your
value is the information you hold.
      "If your computers can be wrecked, you become very
protective of your property.  It doesn't just have to be a
computer virus.  It can be a hurricane or someone coming in and
blowing up your machines.  Look at the World Trade Center."
(Commonwealth Films, 223 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, Mass. 02116;
617-262-5634; fax 617-262-6948).

The Goldilocks Economy 

The 1996 brand of U.S. economic porridge should be just like in
the Goldilocks & The Three Bears folk tale -- "not too hot, not
too cold, but just right." Which means an American recipe that
calls for slower growth, lower interest rates, and virtually zero
inflation. Signaling a protracted slowdown at the end of 1995, the
recently released "Leading Economic Indicators" fell by 0.3% in
November, after dropping 0.5% last October, and 0.1% last
September. Some economists forecast (but not with much certainty)
a U.S. recession in the second half of 1996. We don't think that
will happen, especially with a President who is up for reelection
this Fall.
  
Scariest part of the Goldilocks Economy: What the Three Bears will
do. No, not Wall Street bears. It's that threesome of stubborn
political animals in Washington -- Groaning Dole, Growling
Gingrich, and Clawing Clinton. The budget mess sure doesn't
instill confidence in business circles, especially since a deal to
cut the deficit could quickly spur lower interest rates. But, did
you notice during the Government shutdown how smoothly America was
running without the Feds on the job? Maybe those bears should just
hibernate this Winter. Yep. Just sleep it off.
  
Less Kicks in '96 

After growing a bounteous 40% in 1995, semiconductor industry
sales this year may post only half that growth rate, around 20% to
22%. And by 1997, that growth could be halved again, or about 10%
to 12%. However, the rate of capital spending on chip production
equipment will outstrip the sales of ICs during the next 24 months
as chipmakers scramble to catch up with robust demand. One
memory/logic IC exec indicated to us that putting up fabs fast
enough wasn't the issue, rather waiting to receive steppers from
its vendor was the hangup.
  
Confirming that growth is moderating, the industry's book-to-bill
ratio slipped in December 1995 to 1.09 from 1.10 in November and
below expectations of 1.11. Industry orders, however, continued to
rise on a year-to-year comparative basis. The SIA, which manages
the b:b data, sees North American semiconductor sales rising 29.6%
this year, about 10% above our projection.
  
Crushed Chip Stocks ... They say that all good things must come to
an end. Like the ballyhooed marriage of rock legend Elvis
Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, who filed for divorce from pop
king Michael Jackson after only 20 months of matrimony. Another
honeymoon that's over, at least for now: Investors and
semiconductor stocks. After starting to peak late last Summer,
many chip shares have crashed, although late last week some of
them were rebounding, driven by higher Q4 earnings. (For details,
see our premier section, High Tech Equities, Pg. 7.)

Poly Shortage Scare 

Whether there's a looming shortage of polysilicon depends on whom
you are asking the question. Last year SIBS had predicted a poly
shortage could crop up as early as 1996. Now others are saying the
same thing. The advent of 8-inch (200mm) wafers coupled with
rising IC demand will cause poly demand to outstrip poly supply
starting now and persisting at least through 1999. Those once
ample inventories of poly are quickly being worked off as
chipmakers put up new 8-inch fabs at a feverish pace. But, then,
nobody ever said there wouldn't be growing pains on the way to
becoming a $300 billion-plus industry.
  
Electronic Sales Surge 

The semiconductor industry is booming because the business of its
customers is booming. Worldwide sales of electronic products
catapulted to $334.7 billion in the first nine months of 1995, up
strongly from the $285 billion in the comparable nine-month period
of 1994, according to the AEA. Components orders in those nine
months shot up to $100.8 billion in 1995, from $76.9 billion in
1994; while orders for computers and office equipment jumped to
$83 billion from $72.6 billion, year-to-year.
  
Closely tracking these higher sales have been rising electronics
employment. More than 2.5 million work in the U.S. electronics
industry, up 5.6% from 1994. Semiconductors are a hot sector. In
Silicon Valley, for example, while hiring in hardware has been
soft, that has been easily offset by chipmakers' and software
firms' hiring. For example, Silicon Valley lost 4,000 computer
hardware jobs in 1994, that was more than made up by the newly-
created 11,500 software and semiconductors positions in the same
year. -- Paul Plansky, SIBS Editor-in-Chief

Microchip Technology
(OTC: MCHP)

Microchip Technology reported record sales and net income for its
third fiscal 1996 quarter ended December 31, 1995.
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 were $78.1 million,
up 44% over $54.2 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal
1995 and up 10% sequentially from the prior quarter.
  
Excluding a $11.4 million write-off associated with in-process
technology acquired during the quarter, net income for the third
quarter of fiscal 1996 was $14.0 million, up 48% over net income
of $9.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1995.
  
After recognizing the one-time technology acquisition-related
costs, net income was $5.8 million.
  
With sales of OTP microcontrollers becoming such a large portion
of the company's overall business, Microchip reorganized its
product divisions during the third quarter.
  
The reorganization is intended to focus the company's resources on
broader aspects of the OTP microcontroller opportunity and entails
the former Logic Products division being split to form the new
Standard Microcontroller division and Advanced Microcontroller
division.
  
Microchip believes that the field-programmable segment will
continue to comprise an ever-larger share of the total
microcontroller market.
  
During the quarter, Microchip also acquired the technology and
marketing rights for the Keeloq secure data transmission products
developed by Nanoteq Ltd. of the Republic of South Africa.     

This type of technology is considered vital for the next generation
of unidirectional security devices used in applications such as
automobile keyless remote entry, auto immobilizer systems,
automatic garage door openers, and various "smart" transaction card
applications.
  
Microchip anticipates the first product introduction from the
acquired technology will take place in the first quarter of
calendar 1996.

Xilinx
(OTC: XLNX)

Xilinx recorded revenue and earnings growth for the third quarter
ended December 30, 1995.       

Revenues rose to $144.1 million, up 58% from the $91.3 million
reported during the third quarter of fiscal 1995 and 2% from the
$141.2 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 

Net income rose 107% to $32.2 million compared with last year's
$15.6 million and 8% above last quarter's $29.8 million. 

For the first nine months ended December 30, 1995, revenues
increased 67% to $411.1 million from $245.9 million reported in
last year's comparable period. 

Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 rose 72% to
$67.6 million compared with $39.4 million in the first nine months
of fiscal 1995. Excluding the impact of non-recurring charges,
operating income, net income, and earnings per share increased by
108%, 112%, and 98%, respectively.
  
Gross margins increased to 64.1% of revenues from 63.4% last
quarter due to continued improvement in manufacturing yields, the
strength of the dollar, and a changing product mix.
  
Operationally, selling, general and administrative expenses as
percentage of revenues declined for the fourth consecutive quarter
as did R&D spending. These two factors combined to expand operating
margins to a record level of 34.2%, up from last quarter's 32.3%
  
While revenues increased sequentially, this quarter's performance
was impacted by a slowdown in bookings, particularly in the early
part of the quarter. 

Highlights for this quarter included the growth of the XC5200
family, an alternative to gate arrays. 

In other company news, Bernard Vonderschmitt has stepped down as
CEO, but remains on as chairman. The new CEO is Willem Roelandts.

Rumor or Truth?
Sun Microsystems' Hot-and-Cold Talks with Apple May
Bear Fruit at $33 Per Share

If Sun Eats Apple,
Will PowerPC Die?
                                                                       
With the board of Apple Computer (OTC: AAPL) slated to meet
tomorrow (January 23rd), Wall St. rumors have been flying that
embattled Apple may be ready to accept a buyout bid of $33 per
share, or about $4 billion, from workstation and server powerhouse
Sun Microsystems (OTC: SUNW).
  
As big as that $4B number sounds, it would be only half what Apple
was said to seek from IBM during merger talks in the fall of 1994.
Neither company would confirm an a reportedly "imminent"
acquisition of Apple by Sun, but investors voted by driving AAPL
shares up and SUNW stock down.
  
Despite past successes with its Macintosh line, Apple lately has
been a loser. It lost $68 million in its most recent quarter, has
been losing PC market share, and worst of all, is losing respect. 

Even if Apple stays independent, it appears doubtful that its CEO
Michael Spindler will survive this corporate crisis. There are
reports Spindler will either be forced out and see his management
role greatly diminished.
  
Internet Interest?

One reason Sun might want Apple is to enhance its Internet
strategy. Apple's Macintoshes can be used to create World Wide Web
sites, and the PC maker has also developed a $500 system, that when
connected to a TV and phone, provides low-cost Internet access.
  
Next possibility: Sun could tap into Apple's well-established
retail PC channels to push its own version of a "network computer".
Apple also has in place a formidable sales force in Japan, which,
until recently, was one of the strongest U.S.-based PC makers
there.

Other Suitors

Sun had been in takeover talks with Apple earlier but these
discussions were broken off when the two computer firms couldn't
agree on an acquisition price.
Even in this newest round, the buyout price could once again be the
spoiler.
  
Other suitors that were said to seek a buyout deal with Apple have
included software maven Oracle (see box story at left); Hewlett-
Packard, which wants a stronger home PC market position; and
Motorola, which provides the PowerPC chip that drives the Mac.
Among Asian giants which may have courted Apple: Cannon, Toshiba,
and Sony.
  
But this time it's different. Apple has "serious problems", its own
chairman A.C. ("Mike") Markkula Jr. admitted. Markkula, a former
Intel microprocessor marketing manager (circa, 1970s), said he
wouldn't be able to comment on whether Apple is for sale "until the
time is right."

Despite its current woes, the Apple brand name is strong. Apple
pioneered the PC business, unveiling the Apple I in 1976, and the
Apple II in 1977. That was way ahead of IBM, which didn't offer its
PC until 1981. Apple's Macintosh was smash hit, but its Lisa and
earliest version of the Newton PDA bombed. It's been a long battle,
but it looks like the Intel/Microsoft camp has won.
  
From an MPU perspective, if Sun consumes Apple, we'd say the
PowerPC is a dead part. Apple has been the only very large volume
user of the vaunted processor chip co-developed by Apple, Motorola,
and IBM to challenge Intel's Pentium dominance. If a Sun/Apple deal
does happens, will future ads be touting, "the SPARC Inside"?

Oracle's Odyssey
CEO Ellison Treks to
Asia to Sell 'Magic Box'

While technocrats were buzzing about Sun longing to chew up Apple
(see story at left), the CEO of another computer firm, software
giant Oracle Corp., took off recently in another direction -- the
Far East.
  
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's mission: To line up Asian manufacturers
for an Oracle project he has taken under his wings: a $500 network
computer (the "NC") for use by the masses to access the Internet.
  
Among countries reportedly on Ellison's itinerary: Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan.
  
Although Oracle's official line from its Redwood City, CA
headquarters is "no comment," SIBS' sources have identified Korea's
Goldstar and Samsung as two possible partners to build Oracle's NC.
  
Not as powerful as a PC, the NC will let users surf the net; send
e-mail; do word processing.

Zoran Zoran Finds IPO Window

Despite weaker chip stock prices, Zoran (OTC: ZRAN) managed to
squeeze through the IPO window recently and is now trading well
above its initial target price. Pre-IPO, Israel's Elron Industries
owned 32% of Zoran. Since shipping a low-cost chip for digital
video and audio systems in 1991, Zoran has yet to log an annual
profit. Recent price: About $26.

What's Up Down Under?
Quality Semiconductor Buys
Wafer Foundry and Design Center from Australian Firm

Quality Semiconductor of Santa Clara, CA (OTC: QUAL) has reached
a definitive agreement to purchase a fully operational wafer
foundry business and product design center from AWA
Microelectronics (AWAM), a unit of AWA Limited in Sydney,
Australia.
  
The AWAM assets will be acquired by a newly-formed subsidiary of
Quality called Quality Semiconductor Australia Pty, Ltd. (QSA).
Purchase price of the AWAM facility is US$5.6 million. The
transaction is expected to close by the end of this month.
  
The deal also calls for parent firm AWA Limited to subscribe
US$1.25 million of preferred shares in the new subsidiary, QSA, for
working capital.
  
Between July 1997 and July 1999, Quality will make the final
payment of about US$7.5 million.
  
Quality Semi has also signed a strategic alliance pact with AWA
Limited to jointly develop new products and technologies.
  
24 Hours Per Day

The six-inch wafer fab facility is currently running seven days per
week, 24 hours per day. After the acquisition, the plant will
continue serving existing AWAM foundry customers while providing
Quality added flexibility. 

During the next two quarters, Quality plans to secure additional
semiconductor production equipment to migrate the current facility
to deep submicron process technologies.
  
Quality Semiconductor, specializing in high-performance logic chips
and logic-intensive specialty memory ICs, sees the AWAM acquisition
as a way to refine its product and proprietary process development,
accelerate its time-to-market, and, aided by shorter lead times,
improve its productivity.
  
AWA Limited, formed 83 years ago, is a leading Australian
electronics company with a strong export business in Asia. Upon
closing of the deal, AWAM's managing director John Dougall will
join the board of directors of QSA (Quality Semiconductor
Australia, Pty., Ltd.)

Quality Semi's products target systems makers in networking, PC,
and workstation markets.

Apple Backs IC Startup
Exponential Technology

Apple Computer (OTC: AAPL), whose own fortunes have taken some bad
turns lately (taking a horrendous fourth quarter loss and having
CEO Michael Spindler placed on the endangered species list), has
invested in privately-held Exponential Technology of San Jose, CA,
which plans to develop superfast microprocessor chips.
  
Exponential, a 2 1/2-year-old firm, is focused on cloning -- and
surpassing -- the PowerPC technology jointly developed by Apple,
Motorola, and IBM. The startup's MPUs, due to be available in early
1997, are expected to be two to three times faster than comparable
PowerPC engines while also being Apple Macintosh- and IBM PC-
compatible.
  
So far, Exponential has raised $15 million. Apple, whose position
in the fledgling venture was originally at 20%, has seen that stake
diluted by other investors. Joining Apple as Exponential investors
are Venrock Associates, Nazem & Co.. and Woodside Fund. Also former
Apple technical guru Jean-Louis Glasee, who now heads up Be, Inc.,
has contributed personal funds.
  
Exponential's two founders -- George Taylor and Jim Blomgren -- are
both IC designers. Taylor's background includes stints at Sun
Microsystems, MIPS, and BIT (Bipolar Integrated Technology).
Blomgren was also previously with Sun.
  
Rick Shriner, a former Apple VP, is Exponential's CEO, while Gordon
Campbell, who started up Chips and Technologies and once headed
SEEQ, is Exponential's chairman.

Answering the Spread Spectrum Call

It's a classic IC startup story: A small band of industry veterans
has focused on a niche opportunity -- wireless communications, with
emphasis on the cordless telephone market. But the fledgling
venture, Wireless Logic, Inc. (WLI) of San Jose, CA must move
quickly to capture a sizable share of that business before larger
competitors start challenging its early lead.
  
That competition is indeed formidable, including such foes as AMI,
Rockwell, Stanford Telecom, and Zilog (see  Table (available only
in printed version)s 1 & 2). Short-term, the battle is for chips
that play in cordless phones and wireless telecom products. Long-
term, WLI is planning next-generation devices to target simplex and
duplex consumer wireless markets such as phones, home
communications, and computers.
  
After quietly forming in 1992, Wireless Logic is now emerging from
its R&D phase to hawk what it claims is the industry's first low-
cost spread spectrum (dubbed S3P) communications processor.
  
The S3P processor operates in the 900MHz spectrum, which is
projected to rapidly replace the 46MHz-to-49MHz products currently
on the market. The S3P is designed as part of a low-cost
architecture supporting full-duplex voice link and simplifies
spread spectrum technology in cordless phones.
  
Atmel: Foundry & Investor

Privately-held WLI, chartered as a Bermuda corporation, did not
report revenues in 1995. Funding has come from the founders,
private investors, manufacturing partners, and the Hong Kong
Government.
  
Atmel Corporation (OTC: ATML), which is Wireless Logic's IC
foundry, also has exclusive marketing rights to WLI products in
North America, Europe, and Brazil; while WLI concentrates on Asia.
Atmel and some Atmel executives are also investors in WLI, but
neither firm would disclose the dollar amount. A secondary investor
is chipmaker American Microsystems (AMI), which also does some
foundry chores for WLI.
  
Last year, WLI closed another financing round from private sources
in order to ramp production of the expected shift to 900MHz
products this year. In December 1993, the Hong Kong Government
funded WLI with HK$10 million, the largest "Applied R&D Fund" ever.
WLI was the first hardware firm to receive such funding.
  
Partnering With Customers

An estimated 90% of the world's cordless phones are made in Asia.
Several of these Asian OEMs, anticipating next-generation phone
products, came to WLI's founders to request a solution. The
founders determined these elements for a successful market entry
were present:

A large installed base of low-frequency cordless telephones;

Pent-up demand based on the limitation these relatively primitive
(low-frequency) devices;

An in-place manufacturing and distribution infrastructure; and

Higher-powered spread spectrum technology (which greatly extends
the operating range of cordless telephones) was approved by the
FCC.
  
At its San Jose HQ (right next door to Sierra Semiconductor),
Wireless Logic performs R&D and marketing. It also maintains a
office in Hong Kong, within easy reach of the Asian makers of
cordless telephones.
  
Finding Markets, Filling Channels

Key characteristics of the cordless telephone market which create
barriers to entry for new players are:

It's a replacement market; It's also a high-volume consumer market;
It has very high growth rates; It requires technical support; and
It demands a total system design approach (in order words, you
can't just create a chip and drop it into a socket).
  
Although WLI had a chip designed, it worked with makers of cordless
phones for another 1 1/2 years to create a finished 900MHz spread
spectrum radio product.
  
The main channel for Wireless Logic to sell its chips has been
through value-added distributors in Asia. The startup chipmaker
provides these outlets with technical support and applications
engineering. WLI's distributor line-up includes: CTI in Taiwan;
Eastele in Hong Kong; WinEdge in Singapore; and FM Korea.
  
Approximately 18 million cordless telephones were sold in 1994. WLI
investor Atmel estimates this market will eventually be counted in
the "tens of millions of units." Looking at  Table (available only
in printed version) 3 on the next page, we see that if the
projected U.S. market size of 21.1 million units is realized by
1998, and if 25% of those units are 900MHz devices, then that
portion of the market would be about a $1 billion available market.
  
Wireless Logic isn't alone in its bullish assessment of this market
potential. Besides WLI executives, Atmel, AMI, and the Hong Kong
Government, individual investors in the company include:

Paul Lui, founder of Micronics Semiconductor; Eric Ochiltree, a VP
at Exar Corp; Jerry Zis, VP of marketing at Analog Devices, Inc.
(ADI); Dave Kress Jr., ADI's director of applications; and two
Atmel Corporation executives: Gus Perlegos, GM and co-founder; and
John Bryant, director of marketing for the chipmaker's complex
logic products.
  
Focusing on the Products

What's driving the cordless phone market are users. These consumers
want systems which are low power, capable of long talk time, and
provide privacy.
  
Now that Wireless Logic has distribution partners in place, this
month its fab partner Atmel started volume shipments of its system-
level solution for a 900MHz consumer cordless telephone. Such
consumer products should be hitting the store shelves by mid-year.
  
WLI's communications processor consists of WLI's S3P (spread
spectrum signal processor), a microcontroller, and RF transceiver,
which form the core analog and digital circuitry. While the system
architecture of the chip (designated WLT9010) and related RF module
are optimized for cordless phones, they're also capable of working
in secured voice link, wireless headset, and other low-speed
wireless data communications applications.
  
The WLT9010 S3P processor, which comes in a 64-pin PFQP package,
is priced at $16 in 10,000 quantities; while the RF transceiver
module (called the WLT9510) goes for $350 in single units. Both
products are available immediately. WLI also offers a evalua-
tion/development system (WLT9720) for a 900MHz cordless phone to
assist OEMs in product development; the system's single-unit price
is $5,000.
  
The WL9010 processor provides hundreds of communication channels,
four hours of continuous talk time, 7 days of standby time, auto
power control to manage low power consumption, 7 million security
codes, extended transmission distance with 50mW transmission power,
real privacy, and security.
  
Keeping the Team Lean & Mean

While John Lee, Wireless Logic's founder and currently serving as
its president/CEO, has strong technical credentials in wireless
communications (see biographical sketch below), he also embraces
the wisdom of gathering the best and brightest in the field, even
if they are consultants instead of full-time employees. Augmenting
WLI's engineering team, Lee relies on outside design wizards to
contribute specialized expertise in RF communications design,
telecommunications signal processing systems, and processor
software.
  
When visiting WLI, we found a very spartan digs. The front door was
hard to find because it was on the side of the building. No frills.
This is a lean and mean startup machine. 

John Lee, president and CEO. Lee is considered the `father' of the
DTAD (digital telephone answering device) industry from when he
headed the technology marketing effort at DSP Group.
  
With more than 20 years of senior technical and management
experience with National Semiconductor, Hewlett-Packard and
Siliconix, he has also held academic appointments with the
University of California at Berkeley.
  
Andy Varadi, executive VP. With 30-plus years experience, Varadi,
has most recently been an independent consultant for technical,
business and intellectual property management. For two years before
joining WLI, he was a founder and director of Sierra Wireless in
Canada, and for the previous ten years, was founder and VP of R&D
for Sierra Semiconductor. He holds five patents.
  
At National Semiconductor for 10-plus years, Varadi held successive
VP-level posts as GM for the Memory division, and later R&D. Before
National, he was director of VLSI development at General Datacom
Industries, and prior to that, was founder and VP of design for
Solid State Data Sciences.
  
James Wong, VP. Wong's extensive technical background in electronic
system design includes 20 years experience in designing hybrid ICs,
A/D converters, D/A converters, amplifiers, and switching
regulators.
  
Wong has held senior technical and management posts at National
Semiconductor and Texas Instruments. He was named an "Invited
Member of the Strategic Management Team" at a division of Analog
Devices.
  
Dan Babitch, VP of engineering. With 25-plus years of experience
designing military and commercial systems for communications and
navigation, Babitch joined Wireless Logic in 1994 as director of
engineering. He specializes in RF and microwave systems, including
global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite receivers.
  
Babitch was co-founder of Trimble Navigation, supplier of
commercial navigation systems and a prime GPS supplier to the U.S.
DoD. He has also held senior technologist posts with Hewlett-
Packard and California Microwave.
  
Neil Halldorson, CFO. With more than 20 years of financial
experience, Halldorson joined WLI early this year. Concurrently to
his CFO post at WLI, he also holds a corporate finance position
with Quest Capital Corp. in Vancouver, B.C., where he works closely
with companies seeking equity or debt financing, including publicly
listing of shares. and/or listing on stock exchanges.
  
Earlier, Halldorson held senior finance posts with the Vancouver
Stock Exchange, and before that, was MIS manager for the B.C. Ferry
Corporation.
  
Roy Essex, GM, Asia operations. Essex has more than 20 years
experience in domestic and international manufacturing, marketing,
system applications, and test development of electronic products
with National Semiconductor.
  
As a production control manager at National, Essex headed up wafer
fab, seals, test, turns, costing, and inventory of a $100 million
product line. His background includes long-term relationships with
OEM/ODM customers in the Asian market.
  
Wireless Logic's board of directors, described by CEO Lee as
"casual and loosely organized", is made up of Lee; executive VP
Andy Varadi; and Joseph Wau, an investor based in Hong Kong. There
is currently no one designated as chairman of the three-man board.
  
Assessing the Outlook

It was an easy decision. When formulating its initial strategy,
Wireless Logic had to choose whether to address the cellular phone
market or the cordless phone market. Cellular was out of the
question: It was much too expensive for a startup to take on, and
many of the competitors were industry giants.
  
So, instead WLI chose the cordless arena, in which the only truly
huge player is Rockwell. Ironically, Rockwell's large size could
also be its downfall because it tends to move slow and is said at
times to be "arrogant" with customers. A big plus for WLI: Its
extensive wireless credentials, such as founder John Lee's DTAD
knowledge and the invaluable hands-on work of executive VP Varadi,
who was a founder of Sierra Wireless in Canada.
  
If we characterize Wireless Logic as fabless, chipless, or even an
upscale design house, we would be right on all three assumptions.
But such labels are too narrowly defined. The key to WLI's model:
"outsourcing", a major business trend of the 1990s.
  
As an outsourcing model, WLI goes outside for foundry work,
engineering expertise, and value-added distribution. All of which
keeps it running lean and mean, and more importantly, controls
expenses.
  
Other examples of WLI's outsourcing: It has licensed Hexawave, a
semiconductor producer in Taiwan to make its RF transceiver; is
working with JABRA Corporation to provide the JABRA Ear PHONETM
Cellular as a private hands-free option for OEM cordless phone
design; and has developed with Hewlett-Packard a customized
standalone test system for WLI's RF module.
  
Clearly, the cordless phone market is a door opener for WLI to such
future telephone products as multi-handset systems and PABX for
business systems.
  
Eyeing Equity Deals

It's quite obvious to us that Neil Halldorson's connections to the
Vancouver Stock Exchange (see his career bio at the left) suggest
that WLI has its eye on a public offering on that Canadian
exchange, perhaps as a precursor for a larger offering on Wall
Street. We've heard that Montgomery Securities, the same investment
banker which assisted Sierra Semiconductor to go public, might
consider underwriting a future WLI equity deal.
  
Perhaps the smartest thing Wireless Logic has done so far was not
only enlisting the submicron CMOS fab skills and proven marketing
muscle of Atmel but also having that chipmaker become a WLI
investor. In high volume consumer markets, if you can't deliver,
you're history. --By Paul Plansky, SIBS Editor-in-Chief

Background and Overview

Germany's semiconductor manufacturing industry is overshadowed by
giant Siemens in Munich. Others, such as Temic (part of the
Daimler-Benz group), and smaller players, are in distant also-ran
positions.
  
In 1990, Hans Weinerth, a career technical veteran from Philips
Semiconductors (previously called VALVO), was able to convince the
German government to finance a new semiconductor venture in
Hannover. In April that year, SICAN GmbH was founded with backing
from the Federal German States of Lower Saxony and Hamburg in
conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology.
The company's charter was to offer design and R&D services to
systems companies developing semiconductor applications and to
chipmakers.
  
The organization started with several employees and has grown to
over 200 involved with microelectronics design, basic research,
systems development, and related semiconductor support services.
  
This unique German semiconductor company is best described as a
vertically-integrated microelectronics design and licensing
company. Its charter includes development of ICs, modules, and
systems. Technologies include bipolar, CMOS, BiCMOS, and RF.
  
SICAN was founded to foster microelectronics in Germany by
providing a design and service infrastructure for small and mid-
size companies. Another aim: To provide design capacity to firms
whose resources were constrained. An overriding goal is to shorten
the critical time-to-market window to ensure its customers'
success.
  
Services and Technology

As a full-service design house, SICAN functions like other American
design houses offering IC development services. The company has
expertise in classical ASIC development using gate array and
standard cell architectures. Its ASIC development group, calling
itself the "design factory," is involved with a variety ASIC logic
design projects and acts as an authorized design center for several
world-class ASIC vendors, including LSI Logic and Fujitsu.
  
Within the ASIC development group, special expertise exists for ICs
used in ATM applications.
  
Besides its logic design capability, SICAN has a design group
focused on mixed-signal and analog applications. In its mixed-
signal group, the company has developed Sigma-Delta-Converter
technology with 18-bit resolution which is available for license.
The design team has know-how for implementing low voltage/low
power, high voltage, high frequency, and smart power designs.
  
SICAN has developed special core expertise in MPEG video and audio
encoding and decoding ICs.  Its MPEG hardwired solutions (versus
DSP-based) enables low-cost MPEG solutions for multimedia IC and
systems suppliers.  SICAN licenses its multimedia IC building
blocks to quickly customize projects tailored to specific customer
requirements.
  
The company has a flexible approach to development strategy. It
will do a turnkey IC design where all tasks from concept to final
tape-out are done by SICAN. It will also work on a modular sharing
of tasks basis where SICAN is responsible for well-defined tasks
that are part of the development project. One of the more
successful models is the joint-development team where the customer
and SICAN engineers form a joint team.
  
Management and Organization

The SICAN group consists of the SICAN holding company called SIBEG
with its subsidiaries SICAN, SIBET, and SIAG. SIBET is the R&D arm
of the group which does basic development on new technologies such
as neural networks and fuzzy logic and has close ties to German
universities and technical centers. SIAG is the company that owns
the buildings and equipment and leases it to the operating units
SICAN and SIBET.
  
The chairman and managing director of SICAN, SIBET, and SIAG is
Hans Weinerth. He has a doctorate degree from the Technical
University of Aachen and still has close teaching ties to his alma
mater. Weinerth started his career at Intermetall (Freiburg), and
in 1968, he began a career at Philips (Eindhoven). Later in 1976,
he moved to Philips VALVO (Hamburg). By 1990, when he left to start
SICAN, he had achieved the post of technical director of Philips
Components in Germany.
  
Heinz Stephanblome is the CEO of SICAN GmbH reporting to Weinerth.
He heads an organization that encompasses the various digital and
analog engineering groups, marketing/sales, operations, and
administrative functions. Prior to SICAN, Stephanblome worked at
Philips Components (Hamburg), engaged in strategic planning and IC
application activities.
  
Plants and Facilities

The SICAN group owns a 65,000 square-foot multi-building complex
at its campus on the outskirts of Hannover. An additional building
is under construction which will effectively double the facility
size.
  
The company through its lessor arm, SIAG, has acquired an
impressive suite of CAD hardware, software, and testing equipment.
  
The design infrastructure includes 134 Sun SPARC workstations and
77 H-P series 700 workstations. The workstations are divided into
clusters of five units in size connected together with an Ethernet
LAN. In addition, two Convex 3840s are used for R&D. A Cray 6448
supercomputer is used in development and R&D. Other support design
equipment includes five ZyCAD XP200 hardware accelerators, a
QuickTurn M250 emulator, a Logic Modeling LM1200 hardware modeler,
H-P 83000 tester, and other equipment.
  
Although SICAN does not operate a fab, it has close connections
with CMOS, BiCMOS, and bipolar fabs to fabricate its digital and
analog designs. These foundry relationships include LSI Logic
(USA), ES2 (France), Fujitsu (Japan), ABB-Hafo (Sweden), and AMS
(Austria).
  
Financial Summary

SICAN is a privately-held company started with government-backed
financing. Since its inception, SICAN has invited other American
and European partners to become strategic shareholders.
  
These include:

LSI Logic Europe GmbH
Cadence Design Systems GmbH
DVS GmbH (Digital Video Systems)
Sartorius GmbH
Convex
ZyCAD
Cray

In total, these industrial shareholders own 81% of the SICAN
shares. The balance of 19% is held by the Nord L/B (federal bank
in North Germany) as trustees for future shareholders.
  
The company's total sales for 1995 were $30 million, which includes
R&D programs as well as revenues from systems projects.
  
HTE Research Assessment

American and Asian firms can utilize the services of SICAN in
various ways.
  
SICAN's Hannover location in the center of Europe makes the company
a gateway to Europe for overseas companies. SICAN, for example, can
act as a German-European design center for American and Asian ASIC
companies. It can also assist overseas companies in navigating
through a myriad of European specs, rules, and regulations in the
telecom and other industries.
  
The second major function of the company is to do custom and
semicustom design for semiconductor companies which either do not
have the appropriate in-house expertise or just want to subcontract
design.  SICAN also offers this design service to OEM systems
houses and has the capability to broker production quantities with
qualified foundries.
  
Thirdly, its core technology licensing activities have already
attracted a following in the U.S. and Japan.  It has
licensing/development contracts with a number of U.S. and Far
Eastern customers. Announced customers include AMCC, Alcatel,
Cadence, Convex, Daimler-Benz, Ericsson, Exar, H-P, IBM, Siemens,
and Schlumberger.
  
The company has completed successful designs in DSPs, medical
systems, digital video editing systems, MPEG video and audio
decoders/encoders, and ATM projects, among others. 

SICAN has developed its U.S.A. activity base to the point where it
has decided to set up an Silicon Valley-based subsidiary called
SICAN Microelectronics Corp.
  
Located in So. San Francisco, the office opens at the beginning of
the second quarter 1996.  It will initially focus on market
development and applications/design-in activities with a heavy
concentration on mixed-signal and MPEG/multimedia development and
licensing programs.

Late News Breaks
Snubbing Oregon, Samsung
Picks Austin for $1.3B Fab;
National Buys SiTel Sierra

The guessing game is over. Samsung Electronics has chosen Austin,
TX over a site in Oregon to build its first U.S. semiconductor
production plant, in which the Korean chipmaker will invest $1.3
billion.
  
The fab plant, to be located in Travis County, is reportedly the
largest Korean investment in a U.S. manufacturing plant. (Another
Korean company, Hyundai Electronics, is still negotiating to build
a large chip plant in Eugene, OR.)

Samsung cited these criteria for selecting the Austin area: A
highly educated and experienced local workforce; IC manufacturing
infrastructure; and efficient operating costs. Samsung plans to
create about 1,000 jobs to staff the Austin operation.
  
Following groundbreaking during the current quarter, Samsung
expects to  complete construction by the second quarter of 1997,
and begin production during the fourth quarter of 1997.
  
Among mainstay products to be made at Austin will be 16M-bit and
64M-bit DRAMs. The new plant will employ .35-micron and 30-micron
technology with 8-inch wafers in a Class 1 cleanroom.
  
National Goes Shopping

National Semiconductor of Santa Clara, CA (NYSE: NSM) has acquired
SiTel Sierra b.v., in Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, which designs
and supplies both components and subsystems for the wireless
market.
  
SiTel has also developed baseband solutions which couple well with
the RF receiver products offered by National Semiconductor.
The first line of DECT (Digital European Cordless Telecommunica-
tions) devices from National/SiTel have passed European standards
and are in volume production in Southeast Asia.
  
Because of the SiTel buy, National expects to incur a one-time
charge to expense for in-process R&D of US$11.4 million, or 6 cents
a share, in the quarter ending February 25, 1996.

Unfortunate Punch
Fortune Knocks Forbes
The Man and Magazine

We were surprised and appalled that Time, Inc.'s Fortune magazine
stooped so low. Fortune chose Republican Presidential candidate
Steve Forbes and Forbes magazine as the target for an mean-spirited
cover story, which we suspect will help the Forbes political forces
more than it will hurt them.
  
Fortune, in its February 5th cover story titled "What makes Steve
run?," admitted it's a "fierce competitor" of Forbes and then did
every thing it could to discredit the Forbes family and publishing
empire, raising questions about its tax write-offs and alleged
shady real estate deals.
  
Sure, Steve's fair game now that he's running for office, but we'd
say that Fortune's professional jealousy is showing like an old
wound. After all, Forbes has been winning the battle for business
press ad dollars for a long time.
  
Don't get us wrong. Fortune has its great moments. In fact, when
analyzing mega economic and social trends, it easily outclasses
Forbes. And how can you fault Fortune when they put Cypress' T.J.
Rodgers on the cover in a story on "America's Meanest Bosses" and
another cover on Intel's Andy Grove ("His Law: Only the paranoid
survive".)

But, back to the Forbes foray. Twisting its editorial knife deeper,
Fortune ran an editorial headlined, "FORTUNE ENDORSES FORBES". But
wait. At the end of this ruse, Fortune editor John Huey writes:
"Steve gives himself away when he admits to admiring only one
member" of Clinton's (team): The ambassador to France. "Now that's
a job fit for a Forbes. We hereby endorse him -- for the
ambassadorship, that is."

Really, Fortune should know better. What if it put its
investigative zeal and skepticism into uncovering the truth about
GM, Philip Morris, Exxon, or IBM instead of a magazine competitor.
Why, those folks might even win some journalism awards.

Alleged Tech Thief Could
Pay With 35 Years, $1.75M 

David Biehl, owner of Semiconductor Spares of San Carlos, CA has
been indicted on Federal charges for allegedly conspiring to obtain
technical drawings from insiders at Applied Materials, Lam
Research, and Varian Associates.
  
Biehl has been indicted on three counts of conspiracy and two
counts each of wire and mail fraud. Between 1992 and 1995, the
indictment says, Biehl's firm made more than $5 million from
selling spare parts designed with stolen drawings. If convicted,
Biehl faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and a $1.75 million
fine.

Legal Flash Points
Atmel Files Against SST;
SanDisk Takes on Samsung

Atmel has sued Silicon Storage Technology (SST) in Federal court,
claiming that SST's Flash memory ICs infringe five of Atmel's
patents and asks for compensatory damages plus triple damages for
what Atmel alleged was "willful infringement" of patents.
  
Separately, SanDisk filed a complaint with the International Trade
Commission (ITC), pleading that ITC stop importing into the U.S.
all NAND Flash storage products made by Samsung Electronics. The
action also asks the ITC to halt importing of all end-user products
containing Samsung NAND Flash chips.

Image Building
Atmel Takes Long-Term View  
Plants Redwood Tree at New French Fab

Chipmakers have chosen creative ways to paint positive images of
themselves that go far beyond peddling ICs. Cypress Semiconductor
is very big on local community relations, while Intel has often
taken the educational route by funding student scholarships.
  
But sometimes these PR efforts take bizarre twists. Take Altera,
which last year sponsored a racing car, then ran a color picture
of it in recruitment ads with the headline, "Breaking New
Barriers."                                                                                                                                Now
here comes Atmel. To symbolize a long-term commitment to its
presence in Southern France via the ES2 acquisition and ground
breaking for its Fab 7 plant there, the chipmaker has planted a
California Sequoia tree at the entrance to the Fab 7 site.
  
The fire-resistant species has a lifetime expectancy in excess of
2,000 years, thus symbolizing "the planting of deep roots of
Californian technology in French soil, and a long-term sustained
growth," says Atmel. Symbols are great, but all customers want to
know is: "How many weeks ARO until our parts arrive?"

AMD, Intel Bury Legal
Hatchet; Sign Patent
Cross-License Accord

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel have jointly announced that
they have signed a five-year, comprehensive patent cross-license
agreement.
  
The companies had agreed to negotiate the license as a result of
a litigation settlement announced in January 1995.
  
The new agreement follows a patent cross-license arrangement
between the companies that expired at the end of 1995. Effective
January 1, 1996, the new pact gives AMD and Intel the rights to use
each others' patents and certain copyrights, exclusive of
microprocessor copyrights.
  
AMD agreed in the January 1995 settlement agreement that it would
not use Intel microcode beyond the Intel 486TM processor code.
  
The cross-license is royalty-bearing for products that use certain
technologies, through specific financial terms were not disclosed.

Toshiba, Winbond Join
Up to Make Memories

Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Winbond Electronics of Taiwan have
jointly announced they have signed an agreement for the manafacture
and cooperative development of leading-edge semiconductor memory
products. This is the first strategic alliance for Toshiba with a
Taiwanese company in the semiconductor sector.
  
In the first initiative under the pact, Toshiba will provide
Winbond with production technologies for state-of-the-art 16-
megabit DRAMs and next-generation 1-megabit high-speed SRAMs. Winb-
ond will produce these devices in new 8-inch wafer fabrication
plant, which will start operations in late 1996.
  
The project allows Winbond to expand its current product line to
include leading-edge DRAMs and to enhance its current position in
high-speed SRAMs, the largest segments of the semiconductor market.
Toshiba will be able to share the qualified engineering and
production resources of Winbond, and increase its supply capability
of main products.
  
Toshiba will procure the output of the fabs from Winbond, and sell
them under Toshiba brandname, mainly in the Asian market.
Procurement volume will be discussed between the two companies.
  
Both companies also plan to cooperate on development of derivative
products based on the design of memory products transferred to
Winbond, and will seek various other opportunities to develop this
strategic relationship.

demands of videoconferencing and other multimedia applications.
`C8x DSPs provide the high-performance processing needed for
handling data, video, and voice and other audio simultaneously.
  
Included in the `C8x family is the TMS320C82, the industry's first
low-cost, single-chip videoconferencing solution announced by TI
earlier this year.
  
Each of the companies brings unique technology to the alliance.
Along with its `C8x products, TI will provide its DSP design
support capabilities. PDI will use its expertise in creating video
subsystems for PCI Bus platforms to develop videoconferencing
hardware suited to the requirements of Windows 95.
  
IAT will bring parts of H.320, design knowledge in Integrated
Services Digital Networks (ISDN) and Windows 95 applications to
product development, and testing to the alliance, as well as design
knowledge in hardware structure on the board level.
  
Products resulting from the agreements will be used by OEMs to
support such applications as desktop videoconferencing compliant
with the H.320 and H.324 standards, business and consumer video
phones, and collaborative software such as interactive whiteboards,
spreadsheets, and word processors.
  
New hardware and software products resulting from the alliance will
be announced as they become available. Release dates are planned

Conner Peripherals and
QLogic Redefining SCSI

Validating the performance advantages of Ultra SCSI technology,
QLogic Corp. and Conner Peripherals have disclosed successful
demonstrations that challenge the traditional notion of SCSI
connectivity.
  
Employing standard production products, the demonstration featured
a 40 megabyte per second data transfer rate using 16-bit wide Ultra
SCSI with 15 Conner (CFP2107W) 2 GB disk drives attached to
QLogic's QLA1040-PI host adapter across 14 meters of cable.
  
The demonstration shows the capability to extend operational limits
defined by the Fast 20 standard; currently set at eight devices on
1.5 meters of cable, or four devices on 3 meters.
  
The Ultra SCSI is a recently developed backward compatible
evolution of parallel SCSI that allows operation at 20 megabytes
per second on an 8-bit bus and 40 megabytes per second on a 16-bit
bus.

Atmel Begins to Build
$500M French Wafer Fab

Atmel of San Jose, CA has started building a $500 million IC wafer
fabrication facility (Fab 7) in Rousset, France, capable of making
5,000 eight-inch wafers per week.
  
To help fund construction of Rousset plant and buy equipment for
its eight-inch line, the company's Atmel ES2 subsidiary has
obtained about $65 million of 15-year financing and an option for
$80 million in credit from a group of French banks led by Credit
Lyonnais.
  
Located near its existing Atmel ES2 fab and design facility, the
new plant will includes a 60,000-sq.-ft. cleanroom and will be able
to make 0.35-micron wafers. The new French plant is expected to
come on line in Q3 this year.
  
At yearend 1995, Atmel had invested about $30 million to enlarge
and upgrade the original ES2 facility (Atmel Fab 6). Another $50
million is slated for the Fab 6 project this year.
  
When completed, the two Atmel ES2 fabs will almost double the
chipmaker's silicon output capability.

New Year Rocks With
Corporate Shakeups at
Micron, OPTi, and Weitek

The New Year has already started with bang, as three chip companies
made abrupt changes in top management. The companies involved were
Micron, OPTi, and Weitek.
  
Last Thursday, Micron Technology's top executive Steve Appleton
resigned. The new CEO and chairman will be Tyler Lowrey, presently
vice-chairman and chief technical officer.
  
In a brief company statement, Appleton was said to have resigned
from his posts of president, CEO, and chairman for "personal rea-
sons." Seems like deja vu for this Boise, ID-based company. In
September, 1994 Appleton's predecessor, Joseph Parkinson and two
other top execs departed from the company for "person reasons",
after a board room showdown with major stockholder J.R. Simplot. 

Micron's shares have plummeted in the last 52 weeks from a high of
94 3/4, closing Friday at 31 1/8. There has been some speculation
in the press that Simplot and Appleton had disagreed on whether to
caution Wall Street on the slowdown of the memory chip market. SIBS
sources indicated that Simplot forced Appleton to resign.
  
In other Micron moves, Ed Heitzeberg was elected senior VP of Boise
operations and COO; Bill Stover was named senior VP of fiance and
administration, and Bryan Farncy was promoted to senior VP of legal
affairs.
  
In a very ugly palace coup, Raj Jaswa was fired as president of
OPTi, Inc in Milpitas, CA. According to Jaswa, he had just returned
from a three-week vacation, when he was called in to a  "surprise"
board meeting and fired 10 minutes later. 

Jaswa, who claims to own 500,000 OPTi shares, is not giving up
without a fight. He is seeking shareholder support to oust the
board and its chairman, Jerry Chang. 

OPTi's stock has fallen from 29 a share to 6 3/8, closing Friday
at 8 3/8.
  
Officials at OPTi could not be reached for comment on Jaswa's
statements, but have already replaced him. The new president is
Stephen Dukker. 

Dukker has been an outside board member for OPTi since January,
1993. His executive experience includes president of Videologic and
a senior VP of CompUSA.
  
In another quick change at the top, Barry Cox has resigned as
president and CEO from Weitek, Corp. of Sunnyvale, CA.  While the
company conducts a search, his interim replacement, Dave Gellatly,
a Weitek director and former Intel executive, will serve as CEO.
  
Cox has reportedly left to "pursue other interests", and the
company would only say that his departure was amicable and a
"mutual decision". In Weitek's third quarter ending September 30,
the company incurred a loss of 1.1 million.

Xilinx and Unitrode
Ease in New Leaders

In a more graceful passing of the torch of leadership, Xilinx, Inc.
and Unitrode Corp. announced their changes in top management.
  
Bernard ("Bernie") Vonderschmitt steps down today as CEO of Xilinx,
Inc. of San Jose, CA, but remains on as chairman. The new CEO is
Willem Roelandts. 
  
Vonderschmitt, who is 72, is one of the co-founders of Xilinx.
Roelandts comes to Xilinx from Hewlett Packard where he was 28-year
veteran, most recently as senior VP.                                            

Unitrode Corp. of Merrimack, NH has elected Edward Browder as
president. Browder, a member of Unitrode's board since 1991 reports
to Robert Gable, chairman and CEO. Gable formerly held the title
of president.

GateField Now Shipping
First FPGA to Beta Site

By Amy Whaley, Section Editor
People & Organizations

GateFieldTM, a division of Zycad Corp. in Fremont, CA has started
shipping its first GF51K FPGA part to a beta customer.
  
This 51,000-gate chip is said to be the highest density single FPGA
currently available in the market. Additional beta shipments of
this part will be made in the next few weeks, with production ship-
ments expected to begin later this quarter.
  
The GF51K is one member of Gatefield's GF100KTM family of high-
density silicon. These chips are combined with GateField software
tools, which are "synthesis friendly" and work with high-level,
top-down design methodologies to comprise the GateField Desktop
Foundry SystemTM, allowing ASIC designers to easily work within
their current design environments.
  
Formed in August 1993, GateField develops Flash-based FPGA
technology upon which its GF100K family of high-capacity FPGAs,
including the "first true" 100K gate FPGA, is built. Closely
coupled with the GF100K family is the Desktop Foundry, a set of
automated EDA tools optimized for top-down, HDL design and
methodology.

Crosspoint Readies,
Aims CrossFire FPGAs

Crosspoint Solutions of Milpitas, CA has disclosed an advanced new
architecture for very high gate count customer-programmable ASICs.
Crosspoint also provided a preview of a six-chip product family of
programmable gate arrays, with densities up to 100,000 gates, to
be released in 1996.
  
The "CrossFireTM" architecture is reportedly the first to combine
advanced ASIC design methodology with high-density, high-perfor-
mance customer-programmable ICs. These devices will be the "first
true" customer programmable gate arrays compatible with existing
ASIC design methodologies, gate densities, and performance levels.
  
The new CrossFire architecture employs a proprietary super-fine
grained half-gate basic building block called a CoreCell. Two
CoreCells can combine to form a 2-input NAND gate or a latch
storage cell. This approach has been optimized for mainstream ASIC
synthesis-based design methodology, efficiently implementing both
memory and logic.
  
The CrossFire product family will be implemented in 0.5-micron,
3/4-layer metal CMOS. Initially, it will consist of six devices
with gate counts from 20,000 to 100,000. The CrossFire technology
road map calls for eventual migration to a 0.25-micron technology
resulting in chips at 250K-and-above gate levels.
  
The CoreCell technology uses a sea-of-gates architecture and the
MicroFuseTM amorphous silicon antifuse technology. Individual
CoreCells are arranged in cell clusters called a "Tray." The Trays
are distributed over the die as a sea-of-gates, forming a "Sea-of-
TraysTM" array.
  
The CrossFire CP100K family will number six devices having density
ranges from 20,000 to 100,000 gates. The operating voltage for the
family will be 3.3 volts, and will have a speed of up to 100MHz.

Altera Adds Member
To FLASHlogic Family

Altera Corp. of San Jose, CA will begin initial shipments of the
EPX880, a member of its FLASHlogic family.
  
The EPX880 offers 1,600 usable gates, 80MHz perfromance, and
predictable 10nSec pin-to-pin delay. The EPX880 offers full
compatibility with the EPROM-based EPX780.
  
All FLASHlogic devices are built around the same full-featured
architecture -- Logic Array Blocks (LABs) links by the programmable
Interconnect Array (PIA). Each LAB can be configured either as an
industry-standard 24V10 logic block with 10-macrocells, or as
128X10 on-chip SRAM.
  
Samples of the EPX880 in a 321-pin QFP package are available now,
with production slated this March. Price of a 10nSec, commercial
temp. grade is $60 for 100 pieces. EPX880 samples in a 84-pin PLCC
will be available in Q296. Altera's PLDshell Plus software adds
compilation support for all FLASHlogic devices, including the
EPX880.

QuickLogic Touts `First'
FPGAs for Verilog, VHDL

Quicklogic Corp. of Santa Clara, CA has released the first FPGAs
optimized for Verilog and VHDL synthesis.
  
The seven-member pASIC 2 family ranges from 3,000 to 20,000 usable
gates with datapath speeds exceeding 200MHz, and counter speeds
above 150MHz. The firm's ViaLink technology provides an
interconnect between the top two layers of a new 3-layer metal CMOS
process. Moving the Vialink anitfuses over the transistor silicon
results in die sizes up to 50% smaller, lowering device costs.
  
The global connectivity of pASIC 2's logic cells combined with the
ViaLink's speed results in devices which can always route a design,
maintain pinouts to a circuit board layout, and provide fast,
stable timing. Thus, Verilog or VHDL designs are easy to
synthesize.
  
QuickWorks 6.0 will support pASIC 2 with Verilog, VHDL, schematic
and mixed-mode entry. Language templates, Verilog source-level
debug, timing/frequency driven placement, and interactive cross-
probing between design windows are part of a package which sells
for $2,995.
  
Prototypes of the 7,000 usable gate OL2007 device is available now;

`Fastest' DRAM Slashes
Costs of Graphics Cards

By removing the cost barrier that previously prevented
manufacturers from exploiting the entire bandwidth of a graphics
accelerator's 1-Mbyte frame buffer, the industry's "fastest"
128Kx16 DRAM from Mosel Vitelic at San Jose, CA lets these
suppliers for the first time offer cards with 64-bit performance
in benchmarks at aggressive mass market prices.
  
Until the new DRAM, called V53C16129H (45nSec row address strobe,
RAS access time, 20nSec EDO cycle time, $8.00 in OEM volumes),
256Kx16 DRAMs were the only choice. Since four 256Kx16 DRAMs cost
anywhere from U.S. $52.00 to $56.00 (as of mid-December, 1995),
designers were forced to leave the bus empty to meet retail price
expectations.
  
Now, for $32.00 (U.S.), four V53C16129H DRAMs let graphics card
makers offer full 64-bit bus performance on graphics benchmarks at
mainstream prices. Since 256Kx16 and 128Kx16 EDO DRAMs have the
same pinout, and most current-generation 64-bit controllers are
designed for either choice, manufacturers can simply drop the
V53C16129H into existing sockets to achieve a competitive 1-MByte
benchmark advantage.
  
The new DRAMs also offer an economical design alternative to more
expensive SRAMs for network routers and switches. 

The DRAMs support set-top box, hard-disk, and low-cost, added-value
telephony applications. The only other 128Kx16 DRAMs appears to be
the 75% slower (70nSec RAS, 35nSec EDO) Sanyo LC322266 in Japan. 

Mosel Vitelic's 128Kx16 DRAMs are available with and without EDO
in 40-pin plastic SOJ packages. The V53C16129H costs $8.00
(Q10,000), U.S. pricing.

IR Says New HEXFETs
Set Performance Marks

The new fifth generation of HEXFET power MOSFET transistors
developed by International Rectifier of El Segundo, CA reportedly
achieves significant reductions in the critical on-resistance,
Rds(on), rating compared with similar chip sizes of existing
devices. Reductions of more than 65% are said to be attained for
N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs.
  
These HEXFET devices offer maximum Rds(on) ratings down to 6m ,
claimed to be the lowest presently available, establishing
performance benchmarks for power MOSFETs. 

Lower on-resistance is critical to users because it directly
supports more efficient device operation and lower system costs.
  
The new family of power MOSFETs ranges from 20V up to 150V. Based
on the fundamental HEXFET structure pioneered by IR, the
development employs advanced process techniques to increase cell
densities and reduce line geometries in attaining the Rds(on)
improvement over present products.
  
The initial 55V product, the N-channel IRF3205, is offered in the
popular TO-220 package with industry-pacing Rds(on) rating of
8mohms. It can replace up to three existing devices in parallel
configuration such as the IRFZ48 at 18mohms, and deliver the same
Rds(on) performance. 

Also available is the 30V series, featuring the IRL3803, with on-
resistance down to 6m , and 4.5V and 10V Vgs gate drive options.
  
All of IR's HEXFET generation devices are available for sampling.
Unit prices in 1,000 quantities of the IRF3205, IRL3803, and
IRF4905 are $4.32, $4.97, and $5.18, respectively.

Fast Harris IGBTs 
Win Voltage Competition

To help motor controller designers cut system size and weight
through use of smaller heat sinks, a new 600V, 12-A ultra-fast
switching (UFS) N-type, insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
from Harris Semiconductor of Melbourne, FL provides 45% to 31%
lower saturation voltage losses (VCE(on)) than competitors.
  
The new IGBT, available as HGTP12N60C3 (TO-220AB package), HGTG12-
N60C3D -- with internal Hyperfast anti-parallel diode (TO-247),
HGT1S12N60C3 (TO-262AA), and HGT1S12N60C3S (TO-263 AB surface-mount
package), switches 12 A at 110 degrees C case temperature, which
is 10 degrees to 20 degrees C higher than competing IGBTs. The
IGBT's 2.2V max VCE(on) at a 150 degrees C junction temperature lets Harris
rate maximum continuous collector current at 110 degrees C.
  
Designers can cut system size and weight by employing smaller heat
sinks with 20% higher thermal resistance.
  
The 600-V, 12-A IGBT is ideal for high voltage switching
applications where low conduction losses are essential. Examples
include AC and DC motor controls in conveyors, machine tools, and
variable-speed drives. In motor control circuits, IGBTs control the
delivery of power to brushless-DC, switched reluctance and AC-
induction motors by varying frequency and/or voltage.
  
The Harris IGBT allows engineers to optimize designs by minimizing
conduction losses. For example, at 12A, 480V, and 10kHz switching
frequency with a 50% duty cycle, maximum conduction loss in the
HGTP12N60C3 is 13.2W, versus 19.2W for the IRGP30U, a 6W differ-
ence.
  
The HGTP12N60C3, HGTG12N60C3D, HGT1S12N60C3, and HGT1S12N60C3S
constitute the latest offering from Harris' third IGBT generation,
in which cell geometries have been optimized to extract maximum
performance. Future third-generation UFS offerings will switch from
55A to 80A at breakdowns of 600V and 1200V.
  
The HGTP12N60C3 (TO-220AB) is priced at $1.86. The HGT1212N60C3
(TO-262AA) is $2.20. The HGT1S12N60C3S (TO-263AB surface-mount
package) sells for $2.25. The HGTG12N60C3D -- with anti-parallel
diode (TO-247) goes for $3.56. All prices are Q1000. Delivery is
from stock.

                  "IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD,
                         AND WE KNOW IT"

When you read these words, it'll be early January 1996. To put
that in a perspective that might cause you a minor spasm of
panic: there are less than 210 weekends left before the end of
the century.

The Year 2000 will start on a Saturday, which is probably very
good news. Because you will be spending between now and that
Friday night, December 31st, 1999, spending vast amounts of time
and development dollars combing through code. And no, you won't
be re-engineering, re-developing or re-vamping. You'll be engaged
in a simple, desperate drive to stop your company - and maybe
your country - breaking its neck on the banana slip of the
infamous Year 2000 problem.

Say what? You probably know the routine by now, but you decided
to forget about it until third quarter of 99. It goes like this:
When a lot of business computer applications were first deployed,
in the 1960s (some were rolled out in the 1950s!), space was at a
premium, and languages like Cobol typically stored dates in a
truncated fashion. Thus programmers quickly became habituated to
writing date routines in the form 01-01-96, or MM-DD-YY.

That works fine until programs start having to compute around
dates that cross (bi-directionally, remember!) century
boundaries. This began to happen to some companies in the
insurance industry in the mid-1980s. Because of course there's no
"CC" for "19" or "20" in a lot of those (now buried? lost? still
active?) system calls. So when we deal with "2000" do the two
zeros indicate to the computer that it is 1900, 2000, undefined,
or an error condition? Well, could be any of the above, right?

So slowly but surely there's been a rising sense of danger in
some quarters as organizations begin to fearfully wonder if
they're going to be presented with some Godawful headaches around
the turn of the century to do with century invalidity.

These problems range from the trivial to the catastrophic. You've
probably already heard the ones about sweet little old ladies of
104 being invited to kindergarten because the local school
records system sees they were born in "88" (only it was 1888, not
1988!). Then there's the weird danger of things like planes not
taking off because computers thrash in panic at the "discovery"
that they haven't been serviced in 100 years. Then there'll be
headline stories about customers being presented with a hundred
years' worth of unpaid interest on their credit card bills, or
perhaps more happily, a hundred years of "unearned" interest on
their savings. Going up the scale of danger, how about old folks
not being sent urgent age-related medical screening reminders,
because they're too "young"? How would you feel if your Dad
doesn't get his prostate test in time because of some dumb
hospital program that thinks he should be being fixed for braces
instead?

And then there's the danger that companies will screw up their
financial health by non-payment or over-payment or mispayment-
payment or whatever. The Gartner Group's Bruce Hall has said in
all seriousness that less than half of US companies are likely to
be century compliant by the year 2000.

Ed Yourdon (Application Development Strategies, June 1995)
produced a quite sobering account of some of the time-line
problems. Last year - though you may have been unaware of it -
many five year financial forecast programs failed. This year,
we'll have (at least) some five year driver license expiration
problems in the US. Next year, look for insurance policy crashes;
the year after, credit-card expiration snafus; the year after
that, purchase order and one-year contract bugs; and the
millennium will herald the start of those age calculation errors
that the press will so enjoy writing (remember all those $10m
telephone bill stories we thought we'd lived down in the
Seventies?).

More startlingly - Gartner has done some calculations based on
the amount of Cobol out there (no-one really knows - 50 billion
lines in production use, according to IDC, with 80% of all code
written in the language?) and the industry average cost of fixing
lines of code (at least $1.50). It's seriously predicting a
global IT spend on the Year 2000 problem of anywhere between
$300bn to $600bn. The lowest figure anyone can come up with is
$17.5bn for the US alone.

If you want to cross-check with some other ways of putting a
metric on all this proposed work, Gartner's minimum suggested
resource allocation is 24 people working for one full year. And
also please bear in mind that since you'll have to test the
system practically to death, you'll need ideally to be at that
stage one full year before that possibly cataclysmic Friday night
- ie you need to do all this between this month and December
1998.

(Gartner has also been so concerned as to suggest that as many as
10% of IT-using companies could go bust directly as a result of
the Year 2000 crisis.)

Think about that. Then think about the fact that the IRS is just
starting to look at fixing the problem. Then do what Ed Yourdon
recommends - check all your money out in gold coins and go and
live on a Pacific island for two years until the dust from the
crash of civilization settles!

Hence the "End Of The World" scenario we've cheekily quoted from
REM. And do you feel fine?

Maybe you do if you were one of the far-seeing individuals who
made it to the Software Productivity Group (of Westboro, Mass)
sponsored Year 2000 conference in Orlando, Florida last October.

Of the over 300 attendees, 13% were of IS director level and 18%
were CIOs, Senior VPs or VPs, with over half (52%) other
management and only 17% on the developer or consultant level. The
preponderance of management can be taken as a good sign, for as
we'll see the Year 2000 is not so much a technical as a
management issue.

Century date change and re-engineering specialist Adpac, of San
Francisco, took the opportunity to poll attendees on their
current level of awareness and action on Year 2000 (see diagram).

                     1 PER CENT ARE FINISHED

As you can see, quite a few folks are still very much at the
planning and early adoption stage - only 1% were at the final
test stage! But the scale of the problem can be glimpsed by other
aspects of the survey. Over ten per cent of the respondents have
over 100,000 Cobol programs - not lines of code, programs. Most
(27%) have between 2,500 and 10,000, and nearly a fifth simply
don't know how many they've got. When asked if there were
application or database files that do indeed have only 2-digit
years, an astonishing 85% admitted that was so. And a bare
majority - 51% in this survey - said they were confident that
application components are "easily identified" by naming
techniques.

It would be easy to continue to throw around some of these mind-
numbing statistics, but we think the point is clear: the Year
2000 problem is a problem, and there is a scale of possible dire
consequences ranging from no effect to worldwide economic and
social catastrophe. Obviously it's prudent to believe the actual
impact on you and your development team is going to be somewhere
in the middle - and like it or not, chums, that means that those
200-odd weekends left to the end of the century are more likely
than not to be taken up with fixing this problem, rather than any
fun stuff (like new development) or sensible stuff (re-
engineering badly deteriorating systems).

Software Futures was interested in participating in the Orlando
experience precisely because we wanted to sift away some of the
Armageddon hoopla, so we could try and determine what real live
situations and strategies are going on regarding the "Millennial
Bug."

If we heard any phrase in Orlando more often than "The year 2000
is a serious problem and we've got to start doing something about
it," it was "Start with inventory management - it's important!"
We say this because of all the user war stories (and yes, there
are a few - some people are already doing the right thing!) the
inventory management issue stands out as the common theme. Like
they say in metrics, if you don't measure something, how will you
know how you've done when you're finished? Inventory management
is the right first step because it can help you answer such
firefighting questions as, How much source code is missing from
your application portfolio? How many systems can be retired in
the next four years with no impact? And so forth.

As Jennifer Schmidt, managing partner for Chicago-based systems
renovation consulting firm SPR, puts it, you'll find that the
actual physical changing of lines of code will be the smallest
element of your cost, ironically. Based on her experience of a
number of Year 2000 projects, a good rule of thumb would be 40%
planning, 50% testing, and only 10% rewrites, she estimates.

(By the way, that inventory check isn't meant to just cover your
in-house developed code - what about all your packaged software
applications. Yes, that means you, Mr Smug Client/Server. How
sure are you that all your glittering new distributed
applications are century-compliant?)

The inventory management angle was in any case a factor in the
experience of Mike Smith, director of the Great American
Insurance Company, of Cincinnati,who co-ordinated the company's
recent Year 2000 fix.

"We have a bit of everything," he admits cheerfully, detailing a
mixed legacy and PC environment where systems using CICS, Cobol,
Assembler, VSAM and PC upload to mainframe screens are all happy
equals. And buried in this richness? At least 75 combinations of
letters and characters that dealt with dates, in the case of the
PICTURE, REDEFINES and VALUE literals of his Cobol applications.

We're sure Mike isn't the only one who might have to say after
looking at some of his working code, "I didn't know you could go
on for that many pages before a full stop." Assembler proved an
easier language to date decode, he adds, but warns that macros in
the language need careful handling.

                      NOT MERE CODE PARSING

In terms of fixing as a percentage of time spent, he agrees with
Schmidt. "We found that impacted code was only about 5% - but
impacted logic was 80%."

In other words, tracing the Year 2000 impact on all systems as a
Gestalt was more important than mere physical code parsing. Two
other valuable insights into getting the Year 2000 fix right:
source and project management. As we said about that inventory
(have we told you it's important yet?!?), using JCL is actually a
surprisingly good way of doing easier impact analysis - but if
you have missing source, problem. He suggests using your JCL
resource as a good roadmap. As for project management: "It's too
dangerous to think you can do all this in one go. The only reason
I'm able to speak to you today about it is we did it in phases."

One thing that you must take away from Mike's project is that in
the end, with the right tools and approach, it became a
manageable problem. A lot of the hard coded procedural logic
proved acceptable so long as the right top level interface is
changed, for example. In over 95% of cases of needed code change,
a simple expansion to include a century date field was all that
was necessary. And he was able to use a cheap and plentiful
programmer resource - "A task force of college kids did most of
the mechanical work," he grins.

But don't take that one user story as a safety blanket: "There
are three certainties in life - death, taxes, and the Year 2000,"
says Hall. "And it doesn't matter about the statistics - in the
end, it's all about your situation."

Dan Spragle, seconded from Andersen Consulting to the Yellow
Corp, a mid-Western trucking firm, does have some statistics,
though. "Inventorying was easily the most time consuming aspect
of our fix," he notes, since 9,000 programs were involved. In the
end it took 17 people 3 years of effort to complete the work, or
50 person years (350 in dog years, as he says...). That averaged
out at about $75 an hour per programmer, a not inconsiderable
sum. The team had also used the Adpac source editing tool to
facilitate that process.

Bank of America's Year 2000 team had a neat way to persuade
senior management that this apparently "empty" way to spend good
IT investment (remember, you only have time to fix the Year 2000
bug - you would be reckless to think you can do that long-
postponed systems re-engineering at the same time). One of its
VPs, Howard Adams, declares, "We sold it to management purely and
simply as a business opportunity - we will use this work to gain
market share and win customers in the face of our competitors'
non-compliance."

Howard contracted James Martin & Co, the Atlanta-based consulting
firm, to use its TSRM (The Systems Redevelopment Methodology). He
found a massive 75 million lines of code needed scrubbing,
including 50 different dialects of Cobol alone. "No tool can cope
with all that code on its own; a methodology for process and
project management is vital," he believes.

                        BUSINESS DRIVERS

Abbott Labs, a Chicago-based pharmaceutical and health care
company, used a combination of product and consulting from
Quintic Systems, Inc (also of Chicago). Again, this was a
situation involving not just mainframe but DEC and AS/400 and,
yes, over 30,000 PCs.

The reason the organization took on trying to pick over this
gigantic IT inventory was simple - a system fell over in 1990 and
another produced incorrect results. Since a lot of its system
output has to go to the Federal Food & Drug Administration since
the 50,000 strong outfit develops and sells new drugs, this was
kind of an important business driver...

To trap the problem before it got more out of hand, the company
instigated a programming standard in May of 1990 to ensure that a
four digit year was always used. It then divided up the problem
into four areas of concern; its mainframe legacy, PC and
unsupported code, the software it purchased and the software it
produced or sold.

The next step was to decide that as far as possible a four digit
year code could be simulated as often as practical, rather than
physically trapping and changing occurrences. This is similar to
the Great American Insurance approach, and also puts all those
perhaps simplistic Year 2000 Cost = Lines Of Code x Change Per
Line doomsday equations.

If that was the case the Abbott Labs inventory would have been
potentially cripplingly expensive - 8,700 external sorts, 8,800
separate programs and 445 production systems needed attention.
And as we said before, the decision to carefully carve out the
systems that will die a natural death soon anyway can reduce the
workload even further - 320 of the production systems were thus
eliminated as Year 2000 fix candidates.

Using this project management tip, the user was able to go back
and cut the projected Year 2000 cost by 50%. But note that based
on this particular case, the systems inventory work isn't a once-
only - quarterly updates may be advisable (old systems have a
habit, as we all know, of never quite dying on their own).

Sandy Carroll, the Year 2000 project manager for Business and
Student Information Services at the University of Minnesota, in
the twin cities of St.Paul-Minneapolis, faced a similar
apparently vast problem with 5 million lines of code (5,000
programs). Thankfully, she too was able to revise her original
costs down by bringing in the help of Phoenix, Arizona based
Viasoft's Impact 2000 product, cutting the impact analysis phase
alone down from 8.5 months to 6 weeks. Of the 5,000 programs,
again, it turned out that not all needed changing - only 3,500
were actually in need of attention.

Don't think Software Futures is saying that this Year 2000 is a
trivial problem simply because in practical terms it's the
feeling from some of these plucky century-date change pioneers
that in practice the actual amount of effort involved is simply a
lot - not crushing. All that means is that don't be so daunted by
the thing that you throw up your hands and don't start at all.
But obviously the sooner the better.

You might object that without support from the corner office, you
might as well hunker down and wait for the food riots. If you
hear the slightest note of objection, you might want to point to
the example of Lou Gerstner.

The financial engineer now turning IBM around has thrown his
considerable presence into supporting Big Blue's own efforts to
clean house for Year 2000.

If you download the very useful IBM's 180 page document on its
approach to the crisis (at http://www.software.ibm.com) you'll
only get more confirmation that Gerstner knows it's vital IBM
gets this right.

The word from IBM spokespeople on the Year 2000 project is that
Gerstner expects a full update every two months on the ongoing
rollout of compliant products, and a 17-strong customer council
has been established to help him get it right. In terms of IBM
products and system software that need fixing, apparently VSE and
MVS are on the minor casualty list, while VM needs quite a bit of
work (not surprising, being that much older). While AS/400
software is kosher, AIX is pretty much okay with a hint of
caution - make sure routines that work with the counter all use
four digits for years, not two.

On the PC BIOS side (and you've probably made the private joke to
yourself about resetting the systems clock to 2000 and looking at
the, er, funny things the computer does), IBM claims a hardware
BIOS fix will be in place this year. (However, don't be surprised
if you have to get up a bit early from the "big party" to reset
some system clocks once again, just in case.) All in all, IBM
faithfully promises to be clean on the products side by the end
of 1996, and on applications by the end of next year.

IBM will also warn you about the Millennial Bug in a responsible
way, (quoting, once again, Gartner), "The time is now, the
problem is real, the solution is ugly."

                   OUTSOURCING MIGHT NOT WORK!

Well, one solution a lot of customers might immediately be
tempted to go for is outsourcing the whole wretched mess once and
for all. Simple, no? Hang on to your card from that nice guy at
EDS or Andersen for a while longer. In a good article on the
crisis in the July, 1995 issue of CFO, technology editor John
Xenakis pointed out that the fixed-price contract nature of a lot
of typical outsourcing deals doesn't fit well with the open-ended
nature of a 2000 fix.

"This problem is so big that we will consider these bugs to be
out of the scope of our normal maintenance contract," says Benny
Popek, managing partner for applications management for Coopers &
Lybrand LLP in Burlington, Massachusetts. "For those clients who
insist that we should take responsibility, we'll exercise the
cancellation clause and terminate the outsourcing contract."

One firm we've already namechecked as active in both Year 2000
fixes and outsourcing, Cap Gemini America, now specifically
mentions the issue in its contracts. More than mentions; its
inclusion raises the cost of a typical five year contract by
between 5 and 20 per cent a year!

Just to rub it in, Computer Sciences Corp has been quoted as
saying it doubts "[any outsourcing vendor] will ever assume the
cost of fixing this problem."

There are any number of strategies like thinking you can ignore
the problem until the weekend before the century change, or
through outsourcing, or hiring a bunch of cheap and cheerful
programmers in India or Russia to do it for you. The Web page
devoted to the issue (http://www.2000.com) even has an amusing
David Letterman style Top Ten reasons for ducking the issue; our
favorites are, Nostradamus never mentioned this, I believe in the
sanctity of all life - including computer bugs; and What date
problem? Bill Gates will solve it.

The Year 2000 problem is upon us. It's not a joke, but it's not
like a comet crashing into the Earth - ie, you can do something
about it. And it won't cost billions for you - just time and
effort, now.

An analogy we'll steal from the management consultants is the
story about the frog in hot water. Put the little green fellow in
a pan of boiling H20 and he'll naturally spring right out.

But put him in a pan of cold water and slowly heat it up, and the
poor thing will stay happily there not noticing the temperature
rise until it is far, far too late. Feel that water bubble?

                APPLICATION PARTITIONING ASIDE:
                     WHAT'S FORTE GOOD FOR?

Californian start-up Forte Software has always shouted loudest
about the joys of application partitioning. Clare Haney wonders,
now that AP is becoming pretty commonplace, what else the company
has up its sleeve?

Being first with a technology (or even first to coin a groovy
buzzword) can garner you lots of praise. But often the
breakthrough artiste rapidly loses its appeal as the world and
his dog jumps up on the bandwagon. Suddenly, the lone player on
the stage is swamped by the entire company of actors and his or
her message is drowned out by the loud acclamations of the
chorus.

No one, as we saw last month, would dare to dispute the fact that
Forte Software, based in Oakland, California, has made the most
noise about application partitioning (AP) and all but forced the
rest of the application development tools vendors to declaim
(whether truly or falsely) that they have it too. Today's concern
about Forte is: Has it won enough user hearts and minds to ensure
its continued position as a leading three-tier second generation
client/server enterprise tool? Since most development tools
vendors are now practicing the black art of AP, does Forte need to
pull another interestingly shaped rabbit out of its top hat to
get its magic tricks elevated above the jostling ranks of other
would-be conjurers?

Forte management has already admitted that maybe it's overplayed
the application partitioning card to the detriment of the rest of
its technology. Company president and CEO Marty Sprinzen told us
last month, "We over-emphasized AP; now we're much more balanced
in our approach. We don't push technology. We're both an
engineering and a sales driven company."

We still tend to think of Forte as a tiny Californian start-up,
but it's been nearly five years since ex-Ingres managers Sprinzen
and Paul Butterworth founded the company, and it now employs
around 180 people. Of course, it took a while for real product to
appear, with Forte Application Environment 1.0 only being released
to general availability in August 1994. This month should see the
shipping of version 2.0 of the tool (see diagram).

                      FORTE'S NEW RELEASES

Release 2.0 is really a response to Forte's critics who savaged
version 1.0 for being too proprietary. The company has opened up
the system, meaning that Forte middleware independent servers are
now accessible not only through the Forte messaging system itself,
but also via DCE and CORBA and users can employ the Encina
transaction processing (TP) monitor to manage Forte services. The
tool now additionally supports OLE 2.0. There's increased
platform support for NT (as both clients and servers on either
Intel or Digital Alpha chips), native PowerMacintosh clients and
added database support for ODBC, IBM's DB/2 6000, Microsoft SQL
Server and Informix Online. It's added international language
support and, on the object-oriented side, now allows developers
to use cross-platform window inheritance.

If that wasn't enough, Forte is already looking for another
differential in the overcrowded tools market. Sprinzen was
uncharacteristically tight-lipped when we met him recently, but
he did say that Forte has already acquired some exciting new
technology from an unnamed company which it will release this
September. "It's a new area, but it's still application
development. It'll be a fully Forte product. We've got a group of
people already working on it and we'll keep it secret. The
company that sold the technology to us has no motivation for
letting the news out," he confided. Intriguing. Apparently, this
development doesn't necessarily require Forte, another signal that
the company is becoming less proprietary in its tools approach.
Meanwhile, this month should see the release of an automatic
application generator for Forte which has been under beta testing
since September and was solely developed at the tools vendor's
Oakland HQ.

All this acquisition and development takes plenty of green stuff,
so how does the heavily venture capitalist-funded company's
financials look? As of last month, Forte says it did around $25m
in revenue. We use the word "says" since the company is still
privately owned. Its first full year of sales, ending in June
1995, netted Forte $15m in corporate revenues. It's hoping to make
the surprisingly ambitious $60m revenue mark over the course of
this year.

Critics will of course point to the whacking $36m VC investment
Forte has taken over the course of four equity financing rounds,
the last of which occurred in October 1994, as obligating the
company to perform over and above the usual expectations of a hot
start-up. However, Sprinzen, who doesn't expect to add to that
$36m seed funding, retorts that the VCs which hold about 58% of
the company, among them Greylock Management Corp and Norwest
Venture Capital, exert very little pressure on his management
team. Interestingly, among the Forte VC ranks nestle hardware
veteran Data General, owning 4% of the company, and Mitsubishi,
which is described as Forte's "master" Japanese distributor,
holding a 3% stake.

Sprinzen plans to take Forte public sometime this year, probably
in the summertime, and its banks are already carrying out due
diligence. Just watch for the predictable "company adds new board
members" announcement as signalling the IPO process is truly
underway. "Going public will give us a significant amount of free
publicity. We are doing very well financially, and it's a way of
getting that information out there," he says. According to
Sprinzen, Forte has about $10m left in the bank, and he points out
that the company's also now generating cash. "This quarter marks
a major milestone for us - we'll turn profitable."

On the user side, Sprinzen reckons Forte has around 170 companies
currently using its tool, with the average system supporting
between 50 and 100 users. The company puts the average number of
developers involved in a Forte project at seven. Competitors will
carp that Forte is getting vast chunks of its business through its
relationship with Digital, which allows DEC to sell and support
Forte worldwide as a Digital product. Sprinzen replies that
Digital sales of Forte account for between 20% and 25% of total
company sales and only contributes 10% to Forte's revenues. That
notwithstanding, VARs and systems integrators have been vital to
Forte winning deals, with Sprinzen saying a half to a third of its
sales are done through partners.

The Forte story in the UK hasn't been anything like as starry as
its Stateside success, but Sprinzen reckons that the appointment
of Mike Hedger, another ex-Ingres staffer, as head of European
business, based in Bracknell, Berkshire, should turn that
situation around... fast. Currently the UK accounts for a meagre
10% of revenue with a paltry eight customers. Europe as a whole,
taking into account both indirect and direct sales, makes up
about 20% of total revenues. The company is just putting the
phones into French and German satellite operations. The UK
operation employs 14 people, which will swell to 20 by April.
Both Sprinzen and Hedger are keen to see Europe contributing 40%
to revenues, but Hedger admits this is unlikely to be achieved
before the millennium. He told us, "I think the UK will grow 300%
next year. OK, that's off a pretty small base, but the average
software deal will be #250,000 ($400,000) plus. We feel quite
bullish."

What of those users signing up for Forte? Well, SHL Systemhouse is
currently hard at work redeveloping the 911 emergency IT system
for New York City in Forte. Definitely a mission critical system!
It should be deployed later this year and the systems integrator
is hoping to be able to modify it and resell it to other cities
due to the tool's object-oriented capabilities.

In order to gauge Forte's appeal among the user community, we
spoke to two US organizations which, like NYC, are starting to
use the tool in anger to build mission critical systems.

                       WHO'S USING FORTE?

First up we talked with Mark Joyce, supervisor, Fibre Systems
Engineering, Computer and Information Services at Corning
Incorporated's Telecommunications Product Division, based in
Wilmington, North Carolina. Global sales for 1994 for the Fortune
500 organization which splits its businesses into three areas -
communications, environment and life sciences - totalled $4.8bn.
Corning's Wilmington plant is the world's largest manufacturer of
fibre optic waveguides and is currently in the pleasant position
of not being able to produce enough product to satisfy demand. To
this end, the organization recently undertook a $150m expansion
and a further $250m expansion is currently going ahead.

As part of Corning's order fulfillment process, it provides all
the relevant data to its customers at product delivery time,
including quantitive information about the length and strength of
the fibre. Each customer expects this data in differing formats.
Using Forte, Corning is developing an application that will gather
all the data, format it according to specifications, and then
generate it automatically. Corning expects the application to go
into production early next year. "It's a beat your business on
application because it's part of what the customer will see,"
says Joyce.

Despite being a Digital Rdb shop, Corning didn't get into Forte
via DEC, identifying the tool instead primarily by trawling
through IT publications. About two years ago, it begun the
process of identifying and selecting a new application
development environment. It considered Visual Basic, PowerBuilder
and Dynasty; and having rejected these, then spent six or seven
months evaluating IEF from Texas Instruments because it seemed to
fit its Rdb with Digital's ACMS TP Monitor environment reasonably
well, but decided against it on grounds of inflexibility in
November 1994. Forte was the next product on its list. Corning
then carried out a five to six month evaluation of the tool and
did a dozen or so pilot projects using Forte.

Was Corning worried about Forte's relative youth and small size?

"One of our primary concerns was that Forte was a version 1.0
product, and was new to the marketplace. However, several reasons
weighed in favor of the tool. Its partnership with Digital was a
strong selling point for us; we thought we would get good support
for our existing environment given that relationship. Also, the
entire market for distributed objects was so new, it was hard to
find any vendor with a history of any kind. Finally, we saw Forte
as a market leader and were impressed by the company's
technology. Our concern about the newness of the product was
mitigated by these factors," says Joyce. "Forte will become our
development tool of choice." The company currently has about a
dozen developers on Forte - six working on the original order
fulfillment project and six on smaller projects.

Around 80% of Corning's desktop units are Macintoshes. "One of
Forte's primary selling points for us was that it supported all
different kinds of clients straight out of the box as version
1.0, for example, Mac."

As for future plans, "We believe in distributed computing and
distributing objects over the network. We intend to implement a
CORBA backplane some time this year to make that happen. What
really excites us about Forte version 2.0 is that you can now
define your own objects inherited from base classes. You couldn't
do that in version 1.0. International support is important to us
because we have international customers. We're looking closely at
Encina TP integration. Performance improvements are also
important to us, such as native PowerMac and some native thread
support."

Next we talked with David St. Clair, president and chief
executive at MEDecision, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His
company specializes in producing software for healthcare
insurance companies aimed at ensuring that in-patient and out-
patient procedures for individuals covered by such policies are
medically necessary. Half of MEDecision's business comes from
Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its software is used to determine
coverage for requested procedure for around 20 million Americans.

MEDecision decided that it needed to rewrite its current MUMPS-
based application known as Utility Control System (UCS) which
runs on PC LANS early last year. The company wanted to be able to
create a series of GUI screens which could be used both by
insurance companies and hospitals.

St. Clair explains, "As the whole area of technology evolves, we
see more and more of the decision support technology being used
by the hospitals themselves, based on rules that insurance
companies are happy with." The company also knew it needed a
three-tier product, since the bulk of the new application was
going to be implemented in the middle application services tier,
independent of desktop presentation services and input/output
mechanisms such as databases and Electronic Document Interchange
(EDI). "We want to have all the clinical intelligence available
and put the logic out on the network and create an invisible
three-tier application," he adds. The first decision the company
had to make was whether to build the application itself in-house
or go out and find an integrated development environment
elsewhere in the marketplace. St. Clair vetoed his technical
staff's suggestion that they should build the application
themselves. He felt that with only 70 employees, 30 of whom were
programmers, MEDecision didn't really have the necessary
capability both to support and maintain the product, given that
each of its customers would have their own variants of the
system. So in the first quarter of last year, he turned to the
marketplace. "We looked through everything from PowerBuilder to
Visual Basic. There were only a few that were true three-tier
architectured products - Forte and Dynasty."

So why choose Forte? "The key distinction between the two for us
was that Forte used true messaging and had more of its tools built
in and integrated. With Dynasty we could've made messaging work,
but it already existed in Forte. With Dynasty you had the option
to build tools, but it was really both an option and a
requirement. The more a vendor can deliver to us in an integrated
way, the less we have to do on that side and the more we can
concentrate on developing the application," St. Clair told us.

We wondered if MEDecision was at all phased by Forte's relative
immaturity and heavy VC-backing. "We're a start-up ourselves.
It's very difficult to fault someone for being in the same
position, certainly that issue was a topic of conversation when I
visited them in Oakland. However the technology was new enough
and creative enough that it was highly unlikely that someone like
IBM would have come out with it," he replied.

A key essential was scalability, both up and down. As St. Clair
puts it, "The interesting thing in all these discussions is that
everyone is talking about scalability in terms of how large you
can get an application, very few people are discussing how small
you can get it."

"A significant area of growth for us is with start-up companies,
for example, managed care ventures. We've been very successful in
helping companies start with two to four users and then grow.
Often they grow explosively and that means they pay more license
fees to us. Some of the alternatives to Forte and Dynasty, in
order to make them work at all, you would have had to buy very
expensive transaction monitors, which made something like that
totally unfeasible for a company with a small number of users.
With both Forte and Dynasty we had the opportunity to go very
small and grow."

Just to prove scalability upwards is just as important to the
company, MEDecision's average customer site has 120 users, but
some sites number 250 users and the company is keen to pursue
business with customers who have 500 to 800 users. Having opted
for Forte by the end of March 1995, MEDecision then spent the next
four months training its staff on the tool and developing three
significant prototypes. It only really begun its true development
efforts in early September. The company's currently in the middle
of the design and development phase of the as yet unnamed
successor to UCS. St. Clair expects to have the application ready
for the market by the end of 1996. It will run on Unix boxes as
the database servers, remaining with Windows on the client side.

He adds that the company intends to develop rather comprehensive
core products and then be able to add enhancements for individual
customers. It intends to make use of Forte's object-oriented
capabilities, in particular, inheritance, in order to handle
customization. So that, for example, users can either stick with
the MEDecision standard eligibility screen or can override that
with their own customized version, by using empty subclasses,
which ensure that the original screen is still kept intact.

"This is a bet your company decision for us - if Forte fails,
we're in trouble," St. Clair concludes. He sees the relationship
as very much a two-way street, since MEDecision will be paying
Forte a small amount of future licenses of its new product. "It's
in their interests to support us; we're dependent on each other."
He reckons that so far the project has cost $1.5m, with
investment in Forte accounting for 10% of that figure, but puts
the total cost of the project at around $4m. A pretty substantial
investment for a company that expects to do $6m of business this
year and proof if any were needed that there are users out there
prepared to wager all on Forte.

Naturally, we have yet to see the fruits of these mission-
critical applications written in Forte. If they go well, this
together with the company's IPO later this year will undoubtedly
boost its name higher on users' most wanted tools lists. If
however some of these systems crash or do not appear on time,
Marty and the rest of the gang will have the kind of "can't
scale" cleaning up operation Sybase's Powersoft got hit by back
in 1994. And as we all know, Powersoft hasn't yet fully recovered
from that body blow.

                           CONCLUSION

For the time being, Forte is definitely making all the right
noises in widening its tool's appeal and exploring other related
application management and development areas. So, we'd have to
conclude that once the hoopla over application partitioning dies
down, Forte will still be a worthy tool for you to include on your
high-end development shopping list.

                   NEW WINE IN OLD BOTTLES:
                        CINCOM AND UNIFY

Gary Flood hears how two survivors of the software industry are
back in action once again

For both Cincom, perennially of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Unify, now
of San Jose, California, the management consulting wisdom of
Geoffrey Moore seems apt.

Moore's 1991 "must-read" for high-tech executives, Crossing The
Chasm, explains how the market for innovative and exciting new
technology must be cultivated properly. "The point of greatest
peril in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the
transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary
customers to a mainstream market dominated by a large block of
customers who are predominantly pragmatists in orientation. The
gap between these two markets, heretofore ignored, is in fact so
significant as to warrant [it] being called a chasm, and crossing
this chasm must be the primary focus of any long-term high-tech
marketing plan. A successful crossing is how high-tech fortunes
are made; failure in the attempt is how they are lost."

Sound advice, indeed. Both Cincom and Unify are even as we speak
placing their toes on the thin, quivering tightrope that
stretches over that very chasm. On the side they're now on lies
stagnation and tiny market share; beckoning far in the distance
is the shining Shangri La of cash-in heaven typified by another
old survivor's recent good fortune, Toy Story beneficiary Mr
Steven Jobs.

But even though Cincom actually contracted Moore to help its
recent re-engineering effort, and Unify has recruited a whole new
all-star management team from Informix and some of the other
database companies, both find themselves in the curious position
of being long in the tooth and yet firing up their engines on the
starting line like hot new prospects. It's as if it weren't 1996
at all, but their two respective annus mirabilii, 1968 and 1984
respectively. Truly, new wine in old bottles.

Let's see what each in turn is trying to use to excite those
famous visionary customers and what they later earnestly trust
will be the stuff that the much-desired pragmatist larger block
will vote for. What chance do these players have of dancing
nimbly across the software marketing chasm?

Cincom is a 28-year old privately held software operation that
has long specialized in database (relational and non-relational)
and application development (4GL and now object-oriented)
products. With its newly announced Total Framework (which in
itself gives a tip of the head to Tom Nies, founder and 99%
"stock" holder, and his penchant for products with "Total" in the
name) the company is focusing on that most talked about and
tantalizing of markets, the high-end complex client/server
development market (with a hint of workflow to flavor the mix).

Unify on the other hand is on at least its third iteration as a
company; it was born as a Unix database company in the early
1980s, had a second run as a 4GL (Accell) supplier in the late
1980s/early 1990s, and is now reborn a third time under its third
CEO at least as a Forte-Dynasty-Seer competitor. With its new
AppMan extension to its flagship Vision product it hopes to carve
out a new place in the sun as a "complete client/server product
for building managed applications." As we said when its new
marketing team came to visit us here in New York, "We thought
we'd killed you guys off years back." So blind to our insight is
its energizing new head Reza Mikailli that he's going ahead and
planning an IPO in July!

We'll look at chasm-crosser Cincom first. Its fortunes seem to
have peaked in 1992 at $157m, but that figure has been declining
ever since; it now quotes simply "over $150m" in its literature,
but it's quite open that 500 of its 1,500 staff have been cut in
a re-engineering program in train since November 1993. Over 60%
of that figure ($90m) in any case is based on maintenance revenue
from its existing Total, Supra, Mantis and AD/Advantage database
and 4GL offerings.

We last covered Cincom in any depth way, way back in September
1992 when we talked to Nies and others on his team about a great-
sounding distributed database product, the third version of its
Supra relational dbms... that Cincom in fact pulled back from
releasing at the last minute. For it was around that time that it
had tempted DEC Rdb Star luminary Marco Emrich back (he'd worked
there in the early 1980s) to become senior director of its
Advanced Technology Group.

                       SAME TERMS AS NEXT

In this new role Emrich has spent the last three years crafting a
new application development strategy based around objects and
object-relational databases, in a bid to establish Cincom as a
technology force to be reckoned with in the same terms as
Taligent or Next. With this in mind a new superglossy rdbms that
would have been trampled in the dust by Oracle 7 or even Sybase
System 10 would hardly have helped put the outfit back on track,
Nies had decided.

Hints of what Emrich and his elves have been cooking up have been
filtering out for a while (we alluded to it ourselves in our July
piece on object databases). At last month's DB/Expo in New York
he and marcomms manager Randy Saunders sat down with Software
Futures to tell us what this Total Framework thing really is.

In essence it's a suite of application development tools based
largely on products from third party software houses but
integrated by Cincom as a set of services, so that from a
customer's viewpoint they exist under a single point of support.

The system includes Assembly, Workflow and Persistence frameworks
backboned by a CORBA object request broker. It went to Austin,
Texas-based UniSQL Corp for its object-relational database
management technology, to Burlington, Massachusetts-based Easel
Corp, now part of VMark Software, for its ObjectStudio
development tools, and to Alameda, California based Action for
its workflow software. Thus Total Framework an object-relational
database including an object-relational model, large globs of
support for Microsoft OLE, multimedia data integration framework,
object-oriented SQL, call-level interface and graphical database
access and application development tools; and an object-oriented
application development technology that comes bundled with
Smalltalk class libraries and comprises a series of related
tools, both general and focused. It is targeted at application
developers, and Cincom says it has settled for Smalltalk because
it is available under Windows, OS/2 and Unix.

One problem that strikes one regarding Framework is trying to see
how it will be of interest to anyone other than existing Cincom
users unless it is directed at outside prospects with the right
tag-line.

This could be challenging. The company is hardly a name to
conjure with on Marketing 101 syllabuses. It was thus extremely
hard to determine what precisely the thing is in the sense of,
does it compete with products a, b, or c, or offerings, x, y. and
z?

For instance, Saunders chirruped that it had no competitors.
Yeah, yeah. Then Emrich chimed in that it was an application
assembly framework; on the slides it says it's best for "cross-
functional business process requirements." Then turn and turn
about, Saunders posited it would be best for workflow based
applications while Emrich sees it working in scenarios where the
customer had already looked at CommonPoint or NeXTStep.

This muddle may be perfectly legitimate multi-faceted stuff
caused by the richness and complexity of the Framework - or just
as likely it's due to the extremely tiny brain God blessed your
humble reporter with. We tried again. Who's it going to be sold
to, and then we'll see what it'll be used for? There are two
aspects to Cincom's answer. One is that there are three
industries being addressed - insurance, banking and financial
services. The second is that Cincom plans to bypass MIS and talk
directly to the VPs of customer services, sales and marketing. So
if you're in that kind of company, expect one of the 40
salespeople in Cincom (50% of the total) who have no existing
clients to look after to come a-knocking on your door.

When our sister paper Computer Business Review spoke to the
Cincomers back in September, there were nine trial customers by
mid-August for the Framework. Two are quoted in the backgrounder,
amid a host of enthusiastic statements from the right sorts of
analysts. The customers referenced are an Alaskan based log
distance telephone carrier called GCI, which is using the
software to develop an integrated billing system, and a Swedish
finance organization called Time-To-Market which is developing a
private-bond issuing application.

We spoke to two other Cincom customers - Toronto-based consulting
company Mark Winter & Associates and Dublin, Ohio-based CD-ROM
manufacturer Metatec. Both were enthusiastic endorsers of the
Framework, which is a good sign. But the fuzziness of the Total
Framework message was not radically cleared up by our
discussions.

For example, Mark Winter has been using some of the parts of
Framework for over five years but has only been in discussions
with Cincom for two. "It's very stable and very functional," he
told us, going on to detail applications built with Framework
components for an oil company, a savings and loan organization
and some retailers. But we were as hard-pressed with Winter as we
had been with Saunders to understand what niche the new Cincom
product might fit into other than it was a first-rate technology.

Again, maybe it's a case of us just not being able to see the
wood for the trees, but be it a better mousetrap than the rest,
it's focus that you need to stay above the rushing waters in that
chasm...

As for Metatec, an existing Supra customer, Alex Deak, its CIO,
said that his team was in "active evaluation" of Framework. A
pilot manufacturing process application is in progress, and the
developers at Metatec like the combination of the object-
relational database and the Smalltalk aspect, he adds. He
acknowledges that the 28 year old company has a great technology
pedigree but that he's never been overawed by some other aspects
of its attack. "We've been a Supra user for seven or eight years
and have known for a long time that Cincom is a strong technology
company but is light on the marketing end. This has had
implications for us when we periodically review our suppliers and
we have to say that Cincom is not high on the list of databases
supported by a lot of the third parties out there. This has been
an area of concern for us. Though I do believe that they will
succeed with Total Framework, I don't think it's going to be easy
for them."

How much does it matter in addition that a lot of the good stuff
in Total Framework is from third parties and is not "owned" by
Cincom? Emrich laughs, "It was a matter or build, buy or steal!"
He goes on to stress that many of the links between VMark and
UniSQL are based not on flimsy "joint marketing" but on "joint
R&D agreements." He also notes that Cincom has a substantial team
of engineers (he himself brought 12 over from DEC when he
defected) who are working on finessing the products behind the
scenes. Both Winter and Deak were emphatic in saying that they
think this "best-of-breed" approach is the best one for Cincom.

Home brewed excellence rather than elegant synthesis seems to be
the theme at Unify, which in a veritable Dracula re-run has once
again risen from its grave.

                    THE "SMART TOOLS" COMPANY

Unify now styles itself "The Smart Tools Company." And using
those self-same Smart Tools are a claimed 6,000 Vision licenses
sold and over 200 "paying entities" paying support, according to
its VP marketing (and yet another ex-Informixer!) Scott Canali.
That doesn't count the surprisingly high claim of 350,000 end
users using its Unify and Unify 2000 relational databases. All
told, this business has made the tightly held and sometimes
willfully obscure company into a $30m operation employing 180
people worldwide - comparable to rivals Forte. Note that a year
ago that was 300 - a side-effect of the appointment of Reza
Mikailli as CEO in November 1994, as we'll see.

Why hasn't Unify faded away years ago? Well, it kept releasing
software like Vision that was just great enough not for it to be
tossed into the midden. Tony Lacy-Thompson, who was involved with
the launch of another second-generation client/server development
tool, Informix's NewEra, typifies the sentiment as to why some
experienced software types have come over to the old-newcomer:
"Coming from the NewEra stable, there were a lot of things I knew
were required in a high end tool that I said would be in NewEra -
or I at least knew were coming soon. One of the things that
attracted me to Vision was all those things were there, such as
RAD, ease of use, real native database drivers, and such like."

In November it released version 2.1 of Vision, which is itself
interestingly enough a total C-based rewrite of the existing
Accell product using the Galaxy high-end toolset from Visix,
which we will be revisiting this quarter. The biggest single
change is enhanced software distribution features, primarily
through integration of Tivoli TME.

What is Vision? Unify claims Vision offers a "unique" Scalable
RADD (Rapid Application Development and Deployment) architecture
that provides developers with the ability to quickly and easily
produce complex, mission-critical business applications using
second generation, client/server technology. Development
scalability is delivered through elements including components,
built-in application and transaction models, an object-oriented
programming environment, and repository-based, team development
facilities

Now Unify has extended Vision through AppMan, a move into a new
area it's calling application (as opposed to systems or network
or server) management. It's a consequence, argues Unify, of the
new style distributed object applications, a new frontier that
has caused some interesting challenges for second generation
client/server developers and pioneers.

Applications developed using Unify's Vision 2.1 development
environment plus the new add-on layer called AppMan are claimed
to automatically generate and report statistics about themselves
in the areas of configuration, performance and thresholds. In its
first iteration AppMan addresses centralized event management,
performance monitoring, software distribution and configuration
management and administration. (Security and asset management and
licensing will follow in a subsequent release.)

AppMan's centralized event management can report some 400 built-
in events from Vision applications, and includes agents which
support BMC Software's Patrol, Tivoli Enterprise/Console and SNMP
management systems. On the performance management front it's
offering includes agents for HP MeasureWare and PerfView, BMC
Patrol and SNMP management tools. AppMan's software distribution
component supports Microsoft SMS and Tivoli Courier, and the
AppMan console can manage Vision application partitions and
servers. A further release will include a baseline set of event
management and performance management capabilities. AppMan 2.0,
due in the third quarter, will provide agent-based integration
with systems management products for security, controlled access
to application services, and asset management and licensing.

To hear Unify folk talk it's almost like AppMan signals a whole
new area of application development - perhaps its answer to
Forte's famed AP? "This is a new distributed applications
problem," says Lacy-Thompson.

"We had a recent example with a defense contractor consultant
customer of ours, who rolled out a mission-critical application
only to see it break. It spent six weeks trying to fix the
problem, spending all our taxpayer money, and in the end had to
go in from the top and get out the can opener. It turned out to
be an overloaded partition. That was something that none of the
existing tools had detected. It was pure and simple an
application problem. We're listening to hear these problems - but
the applications aren't talking."

Another aspect to AppMan, says Unify, is the whole integration of
products like Tivoli's software distribution product Courier.
Again, Lacy-Thompson has a startling anecdote - heard the one
about the company that actually hires a Lear Jet once a month to
distribute its 6,000 floppies to the field? Now that really is
SneakerNet - SneakerNet++, if you like.

But then again it's drawing back from claiming that this is the
start of a whole new sub-industry; AppMan is purely for Vision
users, and is essentially an added extra goodie. So how do the
Vision customers out there feel about it and the company?

We spoke to a customer who has been quoted a couple of times in
the press already about Vision - Greg Hindson of Tustin,
California financial apps provider Nortridge Software. He has
been using Vision (and before that Accell) since 1987, and told
Software Futures he was "very happy" with Vision's functionality
and performance, while noting of course that it'll never be quite
as fast as compiled C.

And AppMan - good, bad or ugly? "I think it's a fabulous idea,"
he says. "With this we're going to be able to cover a lot of
things that other products don't have. Just in software
distribution - I'm tickled to death Unify's going to look after
the licensing issue for me, a big issue in client/server."

Now this sounds familiar when we recall Cincom: as for Unify as a
company, he's happy with the new talent on board, but adds, "It's
always been weak in getting new sales and getting that message
out there. I've shown it to PowerBuilder developers who say it's
neat, but they've just never heard of it. And they have a
fabulous database with no market share."

Uh oh. Feel the winds from the chasm tugging at your
shirtsleeves?

Not so Reza Mikailli, the Unify CEO, who enthuses that his track
record alone as lead developer of the OnLine rdbms for Informix
and previous work at Ingres (where he claims he helped sell
Ingres to ASK - wouldn't brag too much about that one, Reza)
should restore some much needed street cred to his operation.

"At Ingres and Informix we all had a lot of respect, internally,
for Unify," he says. "But now I'm here I find that previous CEOs
have not concentrated on growing the business; they seemed more
interested in cutting down as much as possible in order to sell
the company."

While admitting that the first release of Vision was a kind of
"me-too" product, he says that the company is now doubling Vision
revenues every quarter and the firm is now firmly back in the
black. He has stripped out some "tired" executives and whipped up
enthusiasm among some Silicon Valley ex-colleagues over the
prospects for Vision in the telecommunications vertical in
particular. (By the way he's also hired people from Borland and
Oracle, so it's not all Informix II.) "We can easily grow to be a
$150m operation," he enthuses.

We asked Unify staffers on their New York press tour stop if they
had any sense of who was top dog in this whole Forte-Seer-Dynasty
dog and pony show. (Seer they see a lot, but Dynasty very little.
"In fact less and less people are seeing Dynasty," quips Lacy-
Thompson, the wag.) Internal figures that its UK marketing chief
Jeremy Jackson told us put it on a very respectable 17% of the
enterprise-level client/server market worldwide.

So two quite mature companies are standing at the edge of the
black and awesome market acceptance chasm. Cincom faces the
challenge of refining precisely what it is that it's trying to
bring to market - at the moment it still smacks a little of magic
beans. Plus it must ensure that it wins new beachheads outside
its successful but essentially static manufacturing home base.
For Unify, issues of differentiation and credibility are
paramount. Software Futures attended the 1989 launch of Unify
2000 - and that has hardly swept all pretenders before it in the
rdbms market.

                        THE WATER OF LIFE

As they stand on the brink both companies have the vital
ingredient of maturity on their side. Both have tempered
leadership who have seen more than one cycle in this industry and
could use that hard-won experience well. And remember that what
the Scots call the water of life - whisky - tastes that way
because it's matured in nice old aged sherry barrels. Will these
new vintages tempt your development tastebuds?

                RATIONAL SOFTWARE: THE ADA KIDS
                       WIDEN THEIR APPEAL

If you were evaluating dynamic programming languages, the chances
are darling of the defense industry, Ada, wouldn't top your list.
Clare Haney asks whether Rational Software, previously one of
Ada's strongest adherents, can successfully move across into
selling more mainstream tools?

What do you think of when you hear the name Rational Software?
Well, if you've ever had any dealings with them, the word
immediately on the tip of your tongue would be "Ada." But no one,
not even the programming language's most fanatical adherents,
would claim that the market for Ada is exactly booming. As one
user pointed out to us, "Most people who want Ada are probably
already using it." Another corporate described Ada as "a bit of a
stigma" for any organization.

So, obviously a tools company like Rational can't continue to
thrive upon dwindling Ada revenues alone. The Santa Clara,
California-based vendor has indeed already begun to cast about
for other means to make its fortune, by broadening its tools to
support other languages, notably every object-oriented
programmer's favorite, C++. We look at its efforts so far, and
assess how successful they're likely to be in the future.

Something to bear in mind at this juncture is that the Rational
management have also had the smarts to try and put an end to the
object-oriented methodologies infighting that's been going on for
years. And they've gone about it in a rather interesting way. The
company already had OO guru Grady Booch, the man behind the Booch
methodology, as its chief scientist. He joined Rational in 1982.
Next, the tools vendor persuaded Jim Rumbaugh, of OMT (Object
Modeling Technique) fame, to leave General Electric in 1994, and
sign on as a Rational Fellow. Then late last year, Rational added
a third OO guru, bringing on board Ivar Jacobson, responsible for
Use-Case, as vice president, business engineering - by the simple
expediency of buying his company lock, stock and management!

Who's next on its object guru shopping list? Double act Stephen
Mellor and Sally Schlaer perhaps, or Ed Yourdon? Truth to tell,
Rational probably doesn't need anyone else. According to IDC, if
you lump Booch and Rumbaugh followers together, they account for
over 50% of the OO methodology marketplace.

Ever since Rumbaugh joined the company, Booch and he have been
hard at work on creating a joint methodology known as the Unified
Method, and have already released a draft version 0.8 of the
Unified Method Notation. Rational says it has received 250
requests per day via email for the draft. The putting aside of
old enmities was suggested in Rumbaugh's spoof on Joni Mitchell's
song Both Sides Now, which he released on an unsuspecting public
at OOPSLA '95 in Austin, Texas.

We quote: "But now our fans are acting strange/ Hey, Jim and
Grady, you've both changed/ Well, something's lost, but
something's gained/ In building unity.

We've seen OO from both sides now/ Both his and mine, and still
somehow/ It's OO strengths we'll still pursue/ We've tried to
bring the best to you." Hmm, well Shakespeare it ain't, but we're
sure you get the point!

Adding in some Jacobson use-case stuff doesn't seem like it
should present too much of a problem. Apparently, Use-Case is
already in the Unified Method notationally.

Gerard Rudisin, vice president, marketing at Rational US, told
us, "Both OMT-2 and Booch '93 embraced use-cases. Booch and
Rumbaugh say they're 85% to 95% there on their own already to
integrate Use-Case seamlessly." The dynamic OO guru duo is taking
public comment up until next month and then hopes to finalize
summer release of the Unified Method 1.0 which will then be in
the public domain.

"If we make it good enough, we want the Object Management Group
and users to embrace it as a standard," says Rudisin. "We want to
take the fight out of what OO methodology to choose and move it
onto which tools to use. I expect that the Unified Method will
make OO grow even faster and reduce confusion in the market," he
adds.

Certainly this is something users welcome, particularly
corporates beginning to investigate OO. As one Rational Ada
software user told us, "With the company acquiring the object
gurus, the method we'll adopt is likely to be the industry
standard." Surely, having the de facto OO methodology, if that's
the way it works out, is also going to help sell a bunch of
Rational tools. So let's investigate the range of the company's
product offerings (see diagram).

                      TAKING A ROUND-TRIP?

The most important Rational product right now and for the future
is its software engineering family of Rose tools, which allows
users to graphically develop, verify and document the analysis
and design model of their software. According to Rudisin,
comparing fiscal 1995 with fiscal 1994, Rose revenues increased
by 100%, a trend he expects will be repeated, if not bettered in
fiscal 1996. Like most software companies, Rational doesn't split
its revenues down into which products contributed how much, but
it does admit that while Rose storms ahead, revenues for its Ada
software are 'stable'. As Rudisin puts it, "The Ada market is
still larger than the Smalltalk market, but we have no
expectations that Ada will dominate in the mainstream market. Ada
is a slow growth market." Rational has grown its Ada business to
a 29% market share, largely through the gambit of acquiring other
smaller Ada players.

In fact, Rational is witnessing a something of a turnaround in
its traditional markets. Back in FY 1993, 88% of its revenues
came from those Ada hardcore advocates the aerospace and defense
industries. As of FY 1995 that business had shrunk to 65%, with
the commercial sector making up the remaining 35%. By the first
half of fiscal 1996, commercial business had grown to 42%.
Rudisin predicts, "In fiscal year 1997, we'll flip that
completely in favor of the commercial sector."

Returning to Rose - it derives 51% of its revenues from the
telecoms sector, and only 4% from the aerospace and defense
industries. It comes in a vanilla language-independent version,
as well as product variants which support Ada, C++ and Smalltalk.
Client/server application development, including code generation
and reverse engineering, is catered for by versions of Rose for
Sybase's PowerBuilder and Gupta's SQLWindows. Next up is Rose for
Visual Basic due in March of this year. In addition, Digital
funded Rose/IDL for its CORBA efforts. Rational has not yet
productized this, but did demonstrate the software at last year's
Object World (San Francisco). Japanese Rose user and Rational
partner Osaka Gas Information Systems Research Institute (OGIS-
RI) has already developed a Forte integration with Rose, which
Rational intends to offer as a product in the near future.

In connection with Rose, Rational rants a good deal about "round-
trip engineering" which it defines as follows: "A user can go
from graphical design to generation of source code, modify the
resulting source code, reverse engineer the new source code to
generate a graphical depiction of the system as it exists after
being modified, and merge any changes made in the source code
back into the model and vice versa."

We're talking "controlled iterative development" here - one of
Rational's three main buzzwords, the other two being OO
technology (naturellement!) and architecture-driven process. The
company claims Rose C++ is unique because it can support an
unlimited number of "round-trips" without losing any data on the
way. Rudisin sums up its appeal. "The old CASE tools largely
failed because if you changed the code and then tried to
regenerate it, the model fell apart. It didn't support iterative
development. That's what Booch along with Rational has been
preaching for years."

In terms of competition, stacked up against Rose are product
offerings from the likes of IDE, Select Software Tools and Cadre.
The latter seems to be specializing in hoovering up other CASE
vendors of late, notably Westmount and Bachman.

Speaking of acquisitions, Rational is very keen to scotch the
suggestion that it only acquired Objectory to bring OO
methodology guru Ivar Jacobson into the fold. "We wanted to add
to our expertise in business process re-engineering," says
Rudisin. "Users need the same integrated support for systems
requirements and systems engineering as they do for software
engineering. That's been a real chasm. People just throw the code
over the wall - we'll knit them together." Objectory also produce
a software process which assists organizations in achieving ISO
9000 certification. He revealed that Rational itself is hoping to
become ISO 9000 certified by the end of this year.

Rational's strategy is to extend its other tools for software
development, until now mostly Ada-based, across to other
programming languages, notably C++.

We wondered if the company planned to extend the same courtesy to
Smalltalk? Rudisin replies, "We've no plan to do the same for
Smalltalk yet. It could make sense. We've got to think, what's
the business opportunity? People are skeptical. They're worrying
about Smalltalk's scalability and that Smalltalk may become a
proprietary IBM language, since the ParcPlace/Digitalk merger
seems to have been complete a mess. There's real concern about
viability of Smalltalk going forward."

                         RATIONAL USERS

Turning to users of Rational Software, we chatted with Alan
Nugent, executive vice president, global strategy and advanced
technology, Global Process and Information Management (GPIM) at
Xerox, based in Rochester, New York. The self-styled "Document
Company" has made a significant commitment to Rational's Rose
tool and has been using it for the past two years. Nugent
explains why the organization opted for Rose, "The genesis of it
was really Xerox's decision to outsource its legacy systems and
to begin to focus its internal management community on developing
and delivering object-based client/server applications. I came on
board to develop the architecture, methods and tools."

Why choose Rose? "It was really the elegance, pureness and
simplicity of the methodology and the graphical notation that
drove us to Rational. We looked at Booch, Rumbaugh and a variety
of tools vendors. Grady Booch was the only one who was driving
for convergence. We kind of bought into the company, and into
Grady and his ideas and his passion for creating consolidation
within the industry. Rational getting Rumbaugh and Jacobson just
strengthens that resolve," he says.

Xerox uses a variety of different development environments for
its object-based applications, notably C++, PowerBuilder and
Forte. In fact, the company paid Rational to do a PowerBuilder
version of Rose. It was willing to do the same for Forte, but
Rational already had that covered with OGIS-RI. It's also
interested in the Visual Basic release for Rose since it has
about a dozen VB programmers.

The Rose tool is currently standard on Xerox engineers' desktops.
Its Information Management (IM) organization is rolling out
object-based applications for internal use to help run the
business, while other Xerox divisions are busy creating OO
applications which are either visible to its customers or
embedded in its products. Nugent reckons that at present the
company has between 400 and 500 Rose licenses, but estimates that
eventually close to 4,000 developers will use Rose. Xerox also
uses Rational to do all of its Rose training and is also hiring
people out of the company to fill consultative roles.

Although Xerox only uses Rose, it is well aware of Rational's
current product family and the vendor's future directions. Nugent
meets up with Rational's co-founder, chief technical officer and
chairman of the board, Mike Devlin, twice a year to discuss where
Xerox is heading and how Rational dovetails into that strategy.
Already, some of the company's division are are showing some
interest in Rational's SoDA, software which allows users to
generate documentation automatically from a variety of external
information sources

So what does Nugent reckon to Rational? "Bringing Jim Rumbaugh
and Ivar Jacobson and his entire company on board gives them a
lot of opportunity. Rational's doing a lot of the right things.
Given the size of the company they are, their lineage and
planning for the future and the fact that they're well managed
and led, they should have a very bright future."

                           CONCLUSION

Rational does seem to be playing a very smart game. Weaning
itself gradually away from its Ada heartland into the real OO
battleground of C++ and Smalltalk and supporting mainstream tools
such as Sybase's PowerBuilder and Microsoft's Visual Basic is
definitely the right thing to do. But there's a veritable forest
of ifs and buts for the company to safely navigate through before
this turnabout plan can be deemed successful. At least no one can
accuse it of not trying to made a real go of things. The Ada kids
have it all to play for!

                 LET'S GET USER FRIENDLY: THE
                      DSDM APPROACH TO RAD

Organizations embarking on their first Rapid Application
Development project often feel baffled about how to manage the
process. Clare Haney visits the Dynamic Systems Development
Method consortium to discover how it can assist confused
corporates

Imagine the scene. An architect has drawn up the plans for
building a house. A bunch of builders are responsible for making
the blueprints a reality. Only some of them are none too happy
with some of the architect's suggestions. They're just not
practicable. In fact these bricklayer has some ideas of their own
on how the house should look. But what are they to do? They're
only the poor guys who've got to use the existing specifications
to make something workable. Right?

Sound familiar? Just mutate the architect into a systems
programmer and the hapless bricklayers into end users and you've
got a situation that still exists in many corporates today.
Systems developers and end users are still not communicating
adequately, and systems are still being built that are destined
for early obsolescence because no one bothered asking the people
who'll actually have to use the applications what they really
wanted and needed.

Enter the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) Consortium, a
non-profit making UK-based organization with the lofty aim of
creating a non-proprietary user-centered Rapid Application
Development (RAD) method which covers the whole of a project's
lifecycle. According to DSDM literature, the method "provides a
framework for building and maintaining systems which meet tight
time constraints through the use of incremental prototyping in a
controlled project environment."

We last visited with the consortium back in December 1994. At
that time it had been going for under a year and had only managed
to attract 50 members, 40% of which were end users. The prime
movers behind the consortium included corporate users such as
Abbey Life Assurance Co, Allied Domecq Retailing and British
Airways, as well as the UK operations of vendors like IBM, Logica
and Select Software Tools.

What a difference a year makes! The body now claims that DSDM has
become the UK's de facto standard for RAD development and boasts
more than 500 supporters, with end users accounting for more than
80% of the consortium's membership. Of this 500-plus figure, more
than 400 are Associate Subscribers which means for their #95
($152) annual membership fee they receive the DSDM documentation
and can go along to conferences, but are purely passive members
without voting rights. The rest, nearly 100-strong, are Full
Members, with end user organizations paying #980 ($1,568) a year
for the privilege which allows them access to the two monthly
User Forums and gives them voting rights at these gatherings.
Vendors pay #2,800 ($4,480) to be Full Members and can become
DSDM Accredited Training Organizations - there are currently 10
of these, with more than 1,000 users and project members having
successfully completed this consortium endorsed training. At last
month's European RAD Conference held in London, the organization
decided to introduce another membership category, that of a
Consultant at an annual fee of #400 ($640), which is an
individual active membership, allowing the person one vote at all
DSDM meetings.

Also in London last month, the organization unveiled version 2.0
of its methodology; version 1.0 appeared last February. DSDM 2.0
has been strongly influenced by the experiences of six so-called
Early Adopter projects, one of which we'll look at later, which
have been formally monitored to introduce feedback, new ideas and
metrics into the new release of the method. Particular new areas
of focus in 2.0 are maintenance and reuse of RAD applications.
The consortium intends to introduce more metrics into DSDM 3.0
and to spend 1996 catching up on what RAD projects its members
are undertaking.

So what constitutes the DSDM development lifecycle? Let's take a
look at the diagram on page 19. The dark arrows show the transfer
points from one phase of the lifecycle into the next, while the
light arrows show the points where development can easily return
to an earlier phase. Fundamental to the DSDM approach is that
"nothing is built perfectly first time, but that 80% of the
solution can be produced in 20% of the time it would take to
produce the total solution." In comparison to the traditional
waterfall approach to development which assumes that each stage
in development is completed before the next is embarked upon,
DSDM assumes that you can always revisit previous steps and
indeed suggests that "the current step need be completed only
enough to move to the next step." At this point we should stress
the importance of configuration management (CM). The DSDM 2.0
manual reminds us: "A DSDM development environment can represent
a very chaotic situation. Various areas of functionality may be
in the process of development at any point in time. Within each
area of development, different cycles of iteration are in
progress. Differing versions of the final system may be installed
at multiple sites, many being geographically widely located.
Configuration management is vitally important to ensure the
project does not degenerate into anarchy. Wherever possible,
configuration management should be automated."

Returning to the DSDM lifecycle. You begin with the Feasibility
Phase which considers both the feasibility of the project and the
suitability of DSDM and should take no more than a couple of
weeks. Next is the Business Study, probably of one to two weeks
duration, where you determine the business functions that will be
supported by your new system. The consortium stresses that the
lines aren't so clearcut in real life as the diagram suggests and
that there can be blurring between the different areas, ie, you
may choose to combine the Feasibility and Business Study phases.
The main part of the lifecycle comes in two iterative prototyping
cycles, the first concentrating on eliciting requirements and the
second ensuring the prototypes are sufficiently well engineered.
The implementation phase marks the handover of the system to
users, along with training them up and determining future
development requirements.

Why do we at Software Futures think that the activity of the DSDM
consortium is important? Well, RAD's been around since the mid-
1980s as one of those hot to trot technologies that users are
supposed to get really excited about. But when you get down to
basics, it's more often one of those "anything you want it to be"
acronyms... in other words, not very useful. The consortium
itself contends that vendors have offered users very little help
about how to manage RAD projects; instead, they've tended to
merely talk up the capabilities of their individual tools. This
has led to mucho confusion, with corporates often blaming a tool
for a poor system instead of the developers who never bothered to
canvass end user needs before building the wretched thing.

The DSDM 2.0 manual contains a couple of valuable caveats about
RAD tool usage. Namely, "The inexperienced tool purchaser should
be aware of imposters. Many toolset vendors are rebadging
existing toolsets as new RAD tools. In practice the functionality
provided is very limited. In most cases, the tools support only
rapid program development, which is only a small subset of RAD."
Obviously, it would be too politically sensitive for the
Consortium itself to actually name names, but it does produce a
list of 15 characteristics to which a RAD tool should conform.
UK-based research organization Bloor Research is planning a RAD
tools report based on these characteristics, to be published
later this year.

The consortium advises, "When selecting a DSDM support
environment, it is important first of all to decide on your
development process, then select the techniques which support
your process and then decide on the required level of tool
support. Many organizations fail to achieve the most from their
support tools by buying the tools first." It also suggests that
development teams should be skilled in using RAD tools well
before embarking on a critical project.

So let's hear from one of the early adopters of DSDM version 1.0,
The Boston Globe, the leading quality newspaper in the Boston,
Massachusetts region and most of the most respected US print
journalism titles, with a daily circulation of 500,000 copies.
This user is particularly interesting, given that DSDM is at
present largely a UK phenomenon. Ever ambitious, the consortium
wants to evangelize the message worldwide. "The UK has a
reasonable reputation in that we created methodologies in the
first place. But we're very concerned not to go and impose DSDM
on another country. We're seeking people to kick start operations
elsewhere." So says Nick Gill, manager, methods & tools,
applications and systems integration services at Olivetti UK
based in London and chairman of the DSDM's promotional workgroup.
There are already affiliate organizations in Australia, France,
Holland and Belgium and interest has been expressed in launching
DSDM in Scandinavia and the US. Gill expects DSDM to be
introduced in Russia next month.

Back to The Globe. It needed to be able the track the production
of the newspaper, to be able to know at which stage individual
pages were, ie, if they were ready for printing or still needed
headlines or captions to be added. Initially the paper's prepress
software supplier Atex together with an unnamed software vendor
tried over the course of 18 months to create such a tracker
system. "They built a Macintosh Quark extension. It was trying to
force us into a round hole. I was writing criticisms and
suggestions that were largely ignored. It was as though they were
trying to wait us out," Paul McGeary, systems editor at The
Boston Globe told us. The system, developed in isolation from the
editorial staff that would use it, was ultimately never
implemented. "It wasn't that the information on the pages wasn't
there. It was that it was inaccessible to the casual user," he
adds.

It was at this time that UK systems integrator and DSDM
consortium member Sysdeco came into the picture. Since it had
acquired Atex, it was a natural choice for The Globe to go with
the company for development of the Tracker system.

So what was it like working the DSDM way with Sysdeco? McGeary
enthuses, "They wanted to know about our processes. They had a
generic tool, Systemator, that was very customizable and were
using a standard database and interface tools. It's a fruitful
working relationship. Their people have an office in the
building, I meet them every day. They code all day and I test it
at night. They're very prompt in making changes. The give and
take attitude really moves things along," He describes how the
Sysdeco people came and sat at the newsdesk and observed how The
Globe's editorial staff worked from 3pm to midnight in order to
get a handle on how Tracker needed to work.

"We have a 120-page newspaper to get out," McGeary explains. "Our
first deadline is at 10.30pm and then we have repeat deadlines
until 3am. We need to monitor the pages as the night goes on and
give the person managing the flow, the night editor, a sense of
where the problems are. We need to know at 8pm if there's a
problem; between 8pm and 10pm we can solve it. We literally do
most of our work in the last hour. We're working in a very
compressed amount of time. It's really a matter of minutes and
seconds."

The Tracker system puts each page on a clock and after a certain
period of time, an alarm will go off, alerting the editor to the
fact that there's a problem. It could be that something's missing
from a page or simply that someone's forgotten about it and
neglected to push it on to the next stage. Sysdeco and The Globe
are currently working on developing an electronic thumbnail of
each page. "What's crucial to the speed of the project and
understanding and efficiency is the constant interchange of ideas
between us and Sysdeco," McGeary says.

The Tracker project took six months from The Globe's first
meeting with Sysdeco in late February 1995 until the paper had a
usable product in early September, with three months of actual
coding. Interestingly, it formed a neat comparison between
traditional waterfall methods and the DSDM RAD approach. Sysdeco
ran two development projects for Tracker. One was creating a
background database demon to update the database, and the other
was developing a user interface so that the night editor could
easily see the status of the pages. The database demon used the
waterfall technique, the user interface tried the DSDM approach.
Looking at metrics, the DSDM project produced double the number
of function points compared with the waterfall approach, and
performed in terms of function points per man month three times
better than the traditional project.

As we've seen the DSDM approach can significantly improve some
end user organizations' understanding of how to direct their RAD
development efforts, as well as putting in place good business
practice for future projects. What RAD technology has always
needed is some common sense rules and with DSDM, finally we have
it. Take this comment from a customer to their software house
quoted in the DSDM 2.0 manual as an able demonstration of this
fact: "About now, I would be worrying about what you (the
software house) were up to. With DSDM I know." What greater
recommendation do you need?

                     MY OWN PRIVATE I-WAY

Gary Flood reviews Bill Gates' new book on the Information
Highway, "The Road Ahead"

Something's wrong with this list, and I wonder if you can point
out the mistake to a certain William Gates, III, an entrepreneur
currently building a house for himself and his new bride near
Seattle: Apple, Compaq, DEC, HP, IBM, and Intel.

Splendid companies all, as we know, and all important in their
respective ways to the start of the Personal Computer revolution
that made Mr Gates the richest man in the US. However, they have
not that much to do with the ostensible subject of the Microsoft
supremo's first book, The Road Ahead, the information highway,
yet their names come up time and time again.

For in all of this 286 page book we hear a lot about Bill's first
computer program (written when he was 13), his friendship with
Paul Allen, playing poker at Harvard, the extremely sanitized
view of how he played around with the grownups at IBM, PCs (why
they're cool and why everyone should have one), wallet PCs, PC
set-top boxes, PC software in general, and some stuff about what
the Highway might be like. But completely absent are the words
"Netscape," "Sun," and "Java." Silicon Graphics gets one name
check in the rather poor index while Oracle, the tribe following
Bill's rival software chieftain and I-Way contender Larry
Ellison, which is at least mentioned en passant, gets precisely
none.

Since 1995 has seen the supernova appearance of Netscape
Communications (not to omit Spyglass or Apache), the surge of
interest in Sun's Java and the endless debate about whether
Microsoft's Network (MSN) would destroy America On-Line and
Compuserve at a stroke - not to mention the forbidden merger
talks with Intuit (no, it's not mentioned either) - this is
somewhat of a partisan map of the Infobahn landscape. Come to
think of it, CNN gets talked about while NBC, in which Gates just
invested $220m, is blanked.

So don't pick up The Road Ahead expecting the full unbiased
vision thing (check out Daniel Burstein and David Kline's Road
Warriors instead). No, what we have here is more than a curious
experiment in vanity publishing. This is not John F Kennedy's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Profiles In Courage (which he didn't write
either), or not even a work as monumentally bad as Mussolini's
play about Napoleon, an item far from being a suggestive insight
into a great leader's secret soul like Winston Churchill's
paintings.

This is Bill at his most down-home, gosh-gee, American Everyman
(the prose is real written-by-committee stuff) telling the world
in the clearest words for those who read between the lines: I did
it once, you saps, and I'm gonna do it all over again. Outta my
I-Way!

"My focus is to keep Microsoft in the forefront through constant
renewal," writes Bill. "It's a little scary that as computer
technology has moved ahead there's never been a leader from one
era who was also a leader in the next. Microsoft has been a
leader in the PC era. So from a historical perspective, I guess
Microsoft is disqualified from leading in the highway era of the
Information Age. But I want to defy historical tradition.
Somewhere ahead is the threshold dividing the PC era from the
highway era. I want to be among the first to cross over when that
moment comes. I think the tendency for successful companies to
fail to innovate is just that: a tendency... I never anticipated
Microsoft's growing so large, and now... I unexpectedly find
myself a part of the establishment. My goal is to prove that a
successful corporation can renew itself and stay in the
forefront."

Hence Bill spends the first three chapters attempting to convince
the mass of Joe Q Public readers, who don't know (or care) where
the computer industry bodies are buried, that he and his buddy
Paul started the PC thing, which seems to have done rather well,
and that lightning will most emphatically strike twice. "If you
want to know how the race to build the information highway is
going, keep your eye on PCs connected to the Internet," he
solemnly advises. "At least that's what I'm going to do."

So the "information appliance" concept is simply written out of
Bill's future history; it's the PC that will bring the Highway to
us, not some pipsqueak 9,000 line program (as he dismissed
Netscape recently, according to US economist and technology
commentator George Gilder).

Gilder gives us the best summing up of Bill's book that I've
heard so far. Bill is seen on Annie Leibovitz's front cover snap
in a cuddly sweater standing on an empty road somewhere. "So
there's Bill standing in the middle of the road ahead trying to
persuade the world that he's not missed the bus. He's out there,
and he's going to catch it someday!"

This book is a good introduction for plain folks and works fine
that way. For other readers it will provoke a raised eyebrow or
two, but that's not the point. This is Bill's raspberry to the
punks who think he's falling behind, and deserves very careful
scrutiny in the offices of all I-Way companies.

"The Road Ahead," by Bill Gates, Nathan Myhrvold and Peter
Rinearson. Viking/Penguin, 1995, ISBN 0-670-77289-5, pp286 with
companion CD-ROM. $29.95 (US).

                         INPUT/OUTPUT

                DOES APPLE HAVE A CORE ANY MORE?

Like hyenas cackling around a fatally injured animal, the likes
of IBM and HP have been circling around the sick bed of Apple.
But what, on the software side, does the company really have to
offer a potential buyer?

Whatever Apple may say about Windows 95 being a pale imitation of
the Macintosh operating system, no one really cares any more.
Microsoft walked off with the desktop market in its pocket years
back and only Apple and IBM would argue any different. And, who's
the largest supplier of Mac applications? None other than the
lovable Redmond Rampager, which could (not so lovingly) dump the
product line any time it chooses.

Elsewhere, we've seen IBM, like a spurned suitor, giving Apple
back the fruits of their joint foray into multimedia, Kaleida;
while their object endeavor Taligent has wound up as an IBM
subsidiary. Both ventures were mega money pits and have still to
hit pay dirt, if indeed, they ever do. Other Apple work on
developing applications for its unsuccessful Newton PDA has also
yet to prove sellable.

The most likely bidder at the Apple auction is IBM - after all,
it still has several billion dollars left in its acquisitions war
chest. A few years back, when IBM first attempted to buy Apple,
the prognosis was not good. Wits came up with the joke, "What do
you get if you cross IBM with Apple?" The punchline, as newly Big
Blue-assimilated Lotus found out to its cost all too chillingly
recently is, "IBM."

Many top execs at Apple are reputedly in favor of selling the
company. In fact, that's the reason behind so many of them
quitting. But CEO Michael Spindler is holding firm and refusing
to jump the sinking ship. Maybe Apple should, as Oracle's Larry
Ellison suggested earlier this year, sell off its hardware
business, and concentrate on what it's good at, developing
software and hardware technology. He believes an Apple
unencumbered by the Mac would be perfect for designing his
"network computer." Can Apple save itself before it's swallowed
whole by one of those hyenas? Or is it doomed to become the
favored MBS term paper in ten years' time: How Apple Flubbed It -
Big Time?

                       NEWS AT A GLANCE

                            INDUSTRY

* Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Compuware Corp will upgrade
its Uniface application development environment in the first
quarter. Over a year on from acquiring the Dutch eponymous
software company, some might say this is overdue. Compuware says
version 6.2 will include new model entities, features and
extensions to accommodate additional forms, reports
andapplication objects. Upper CASE tools will also be able to
transfer design work into Uniface automatically, the company
claims.It adds that 6.2 incorporates the canonical four object
techniques (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and
polymorphism, class!). The company also plans to introduce
dynamic partitioning by the end of 1996, which will include its
EcoTools distributed management performance software.

* Umang Gupta has had to fall on his sword to save what's left of
his company. The start of the year found the ex-Oracle founder
announcing his departure from his once eponymous company (to be
renamed the anonymous Centura Software). New head Sam Inman (who
has been jointly running the company since April) took the
opportunity to push through a 17% headcount reduction (taking
staff numbers down to 330) and it will also have to take a
restructuring charge of $9m for the quarter. We at Software
Futures were surprised - mainly because we'd been so sure it
would fall to stakeholder Computer Associates instead.

* Howls of protest were heard throughout the Valley at President
Clinton's decision to veto a widely-supported bill to curb the
number of lawsuits hi-tech companies have to face from supposedly
irate shareholders each time they have a poor quarter. The
American Electronics Association notes in its angry statement
after the last minute blockage that this is a $2.4bn quasi-
industry, which benefits lawyers reaping a third of that figure.

* The Object Management Group took its recent emphasis on
vertical markets to retune itself along such lines: and as a
result its technology request process will be exanded to include
business applications as well as underlying infrastructure
software. The body now also claims an impressive 555 members - of
whom only 103 have full voting rights, however.

* Now how's about this for responsible behaviour? A Spanish
student called Alvaro Martinez spotted a weak point in the
Internet connection of his prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez. But
rather than egregiously misbehaving, the 23-year old called the
authorities to point out the danger, and then preceded to
volunteer to come and fix it. Glad to hear that not all hackers
are irresponsible clowns, we wish him Feliz Navidad!

                            BUSINESS

* Just exactly how many people are on the Internet - 25, 30, 40
million? According to what's claimed to be the first
statistically defensible study of Internet users, the whole of
the USA only contains 5.8 million real users. The study, put
together by Internet veterans O'Reilly and Associates and Trish
Information Services, polled 29,901 individuals, giving a
sampling error of less than 1% it's claimed. The previous dearth
of hard data is highlighted by the fact that the company got
funding from International Thompson Publishing, IBM/Lotus, Turner
Broadcast Systems/CNN, MCI/News Corp Online Ventures and a few
others who might reasonably want real data. The study defined
'Internet users' as people of 18 years of age or over who have
direct access to the Net and use email, as well as one or more
Internet-specific applications, such as FTP, gopher, telnet or a
Web browser. Thus people who connected via a commercial online
service aren't included in that six million. The company predicts
that the total online population will grow to 15.7 million; the
number of pure online-service users is reckoned to remain
constant at 3.9 million, with a further 6 million using both
online and Internet services and 5.8 million using nothing but
direct Internet feeds.

* Just prior to the holidays (could that timing be a
coincidence?) Taligent Inc's fate was sealed, with the ill-fated
joint venture rolling back into IBM and becoming a subsidiary
called the Taligent Object Technology Center. More than half of
its 400-odd staff will be laid off, with the rest continuing to
operate out of its premises in Cupertino, California. Its other
two investors, Apple and Hewlett-Packard, will continue to have
rights to the unit's CommonPoint technology, though only IBM has
displayed any real enthusiasm for the C++ system.To the amusement
of our sister paper Unigram.X, a HP spokesperson claimed the
company had met all reasearch goals expected from Taligent - but
was flummoxed because the piece of paper they were reading from
didn't list what those goals might have been...

* Hats off to Buzz! Pixar Animation Studios Inc has repaid
bigtime for Steve Jobs - its IPO made him a paper billionaire for
the first time, with his stake valued at $1.2bn on the first day
close - more than his Apple shares were ever worth while he was
there! And that for a firm bought for an estimated $10m, but in
which admittedly he went on to invest at least $50m. Pixar
created its own cluster of 117 Sun 20 workstations - 87 duals and
30 four-processor models, to handle the rendering of each of the
114,000 frames in the 77-minute Toy Story epic. Expect
parallelised versions of its software for Sparc and Solaris
architectures.

                          UK PRODUCTS

                       BROWSING ASYMETRIX

Bellevue, Washington-based Windows multimedia and client/server
tools vendor Asymetrix has announced a new database browser Info
Assistant. The company claims the software "replaces arcane
database terminology with plain language commands." Primarily
aimed at large corporates in multi-user environments, Info
Assistant is designed to help users of complex databases - Oracle
7, Sybase SQL Server 10, Microsoft SQL Server and Borland's
dBase, Paradox and InterBase - extract information in the form
they require. It uses the Borland Database Engine to obtain
direct access to the database systems. In addition, users can
import data from Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro Pro spreadsheets,
or text files. The browser is a 32-bit Windows 95 application,
compatible with industry standards such as MAPI, OLE and ODBC. It
consists of four elements: Fact Browser, Query Generation,
Analysis and Presentation Views and Integration with popular
office suite software. Info Assistant is available from UK value
added distributor ICS Solutions initially at an introductory
price of #349 plus VAT for at least the first three months of
this year. Thereafter the price will be #545 plus VAT and you can
reach ICS on (01256) 469 460.

                     LBMS' SYSTEMS ENGINEER

Now fully settled in its new home of Houston, Texas, former UK
CASE company LBMS is shipping the latest version of its flagship
product Systems Engineer (SE) Version 6.1. This is a
client/server analysis and design tool for workgroup-based
application development. Optimised for Windows 95, the tool
contains design objects with what the company describes as a rich
set of properties beyond their standard name and textual
description for easy editing in a tabsheet approach. This means
users can now view and edit all properties of an object in one
window. The software incorporates OLE linkage through the
repository, enabling any SE object to be linked in any OLE-
capable application, including email, word processing and drawing
packages. Along with the Windows 95 enhancements, the CASE vendor
claims that the new features will simplify object creation and
editing, reduce the number of key strokes for users and improve
integration with other desktop tools. Speaking of third party
products, Systems Engineer Version 6.1 works with leading 4GL
tools including Microsoft's Visual Basic and Sybase's
PowerBuilder. Supported databases include DB/2, Oracle, Sybase
and Microsoft SQL Server. In terms of platform requirements, the
tool needs Windows 95, 3.1 or NT for the client workstation and
DOS, OS/2, NetWare 3.x and 4.x and Windows NT 3.5x for the
SE/Repository server. TCP/IP workstation connectivity is
supported for NT servers. Systems Engineer Version 6.1 costs
#3,000 per user. If you require further information, please feel
free to contact Pete Stone at LBMS on (0171) 878 8762.

                    SEEING IN FOUR DIMENSIONS

Just when you thought the Windows client/server database market
must be fully saturated with the likes of Access, Approach and
Paradox, along comes another would-be entrant. Already dominant
in the Macintosh rdbms arena (according to Newsweek, it has 75%
of the worldwide market), software vendor ACI wants a piece of
the Windows piece. To this end, it has launched 4D Server 1.5,
its client/server relational database which now supports both the
Windows and Mac environments. 4D Server is the multi-user version
of 4th Dimension, ACI's platform-independent relational database
solution. The company claims that 4D Server 1.5 manages team
development simply and logically by acting as an application
server as well as a data server and can automatically control
object locking and version control by check in/check out
capabilities. The database ships with 4D Backup which allows full
backup and restore, logfiles and logfile restoration and
mirroring to a range of media. Both 4D Server 1.5 for Macintosh
and Windows come with two clients at a cost of #995. Existing 4D
Server uses can upgrade to the new Mac version for #395 or to the
Windows release for #795. Additional user licences can be added
in units of 1, 5 or 10 by purchasing expansion disks. If you need
more data, please ring ACI UK on (01625) 536 178.

                    FIREWALLING THE INTERNET

European network connectivity specialist Integralis,
headquartered in Theale, near Reading, Berkshire, has released a
new version of one of its Internet security products. Checkpoint
Firewall-1 version 2.0 features multiple encryption schemes
including FWZ1, a proprietary algorithm which allows
organisations to encrypt all communications. The application's
address translation capabilities enable companies to leverage a
small number of registered IP addresses into multiple
connections. Organisations can use this for day-to-day Internet
correspondence which reduces reliance on public telecoms or
expensive leased lines. The software provides comprehensive
remote connectivity for all TCP, UDP and RPC applications,
supporting standard smart cards or soft key solutions, such as
Security Dynamics SecureID. Supported platforms include SunOS
4.1.3 and Solaris 2.4 for Sparc, Intel 80x86 and Pentium-based
systems, along with HP-9000 workstations and servers running HP-
UX. Firewall-1 version 2.0 is available from Integralis priced
from around #4,000. If you require further details, please
contact Paula Irvine at Integralis on (01734) 306 060.

A NEW STRATEGY...

We knew this day would come.  Even before we launched the
Distributed Systems Management Report in October 1994,
we knew that network management and systems management
would eventually become indistinguishable.  We knew that
we would have to merge our two newsletters, Distributed
Systems Management Report and Network Management Systems
& Strategies -- for what good is a network without the
systems attached to it, and what good is a system without
a network to connect it to other systems?

NMS&S has been providing information and analysis of
advances in network management since 1989.  Although
managing networks remains a primary concern for many
large companies, the technology has reached a certain
level of stability.  In the last couple of years, there
has been a very strong trend toward extending network
management schemes to reach out to the systems at the
other end of the network.

All four of the top network management platform vendors
have responded to this trend, sealing the merger of the
two disciplines:

* Cabletron Systems last August formed partnerships with
13 companies to give its Spectrum network management
platform systems management capabilities.  The companies
included systems management specialists like Computer
Associates, Compuware, and Tivoli.

* Hewlett-Packard over the past couple of years has added
systems management applications to its OpenView platform.
These include OperationsCenter for operations and problem
management and AdminCenter for configuration and change
management.

* IBM last May introduced SystemView, which forms more
tangible links between the systems management products
it has offered for some time to its NetView network
management platform.  In the future, all the systems from
IBM will be able to be managed from a central point of
the customer's choosing.

* Sun Microsystems early last year built a systems
management solution called Solstice around its net
management engine, SunNet Manager.  Solstice covers eight
different management disciplines with 15 products, and
Sun enlisted the aid of several other companies,
including the some of the same ones that are working with
Cabletron.

These moves are not an end, but a beginning.  Vendors
have a long way to go before they satisfy all of the
management requirements of their customers.  And users
still need to figure out what it is that they need from
vendors, as their networks continue to expand at alarming
rates and last year's systems are connected with this
year's.

The network manager's job isn't getting any easier.  But
in the coming years there will be new ways to do
things -- and a lot more information that can be gathered
from network devices and end systems.  The challenge will
be in choosing the right tools to decipher it all.  We
at DataTrends will lend a hand by keeping you informed
of the latest developments and putting them into
perspective.  Welcome to Systems & Network Management
Report.

MMTF RELEASES FOUR PROPOSED MOBILE MIBS FOR SNMP

The Mobile Management Task Force (MMTF) yesterday
announced the group has finalized a family of Mobile
Management MIBs designed to extend current network
management standards to encompass the multiple needs of
mobile computer users.  In addition, these proposals have
been designed to be suitable for adoption by both the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF).  The release of these four
proposed MIBs marks the culmination of almost a year's
work; Epilogue and Xircom began working on a Mobile
Management MIB at NetWorld+Interop last spring, which led
to the formation of the MMTF in August.

The MMTF has developed four Mobile Management sub-MIBs
that can be implemented as extensions to the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP): an Adapter MIB, a
System MIB, a Link MIB, and an Extended System MIB.  By
using these MIBs (management information bases) either
singly or in combination, developers can create network
management applications customized for a mobile computer
environment.  For those interested in testing the MIBs,
copies are available from the MMTF via the World Wide Web
at http://www.epilogue.com/mmtf.

"As we discussed mobile management with industry experts,
we discovered there is no single definition for `mobile'
computing," said David Preston, President and COO of
Epilogue Technology, one of the MMTF founding members.
"Some mobile users are looking at cellular solutions,
others at infrared technology, and still others think of
mobile computing as dial-up access.  With such diverse
connectivity criteria, it became clear that if we were
to create a single mobile management MIB to fit
everyone's requirements, that MIB would be so large and
require so much processing power and network overhead it
would be impractical to deploy.  By developing four
different mobile MIBs with specific functionality, we can
help SNMP developers extend more targeted, customizable
network management support to their mobile networking
environments, rather than forcing them to use a
one-size-fits-all approach."

The four mobile MIBs define objects that address
administration issues specific to different aspects of
mobile computing.  The System MIB is designed to provide
data about the mobile system drivers, card and socket
services, power status, and related system conditions.
The Adapter MIB provides information about the mobile
network adapter, including network hardware information,
whether the mobile computer is connected using a wired
or wireless connection, etc.  The Link MIB provides
information about the mobile network link itself, such
as link status and performance, that can be useful in
troubleshooting and optimizing the actual connection.
Finally, the Extended System MIB contains information
about system extensions, such as the Proxy Group.

In creating the four mobile management MIBs, the MMTF
development team consciously worked to draft proposed
standards that would be acceptable to both the IETF as
a Management Information Base (MIB) extension to SNMP,
and to the DMTF as a Management Information Format (MIF)
file for their Desktop Management Interface (DMI).  These
four mobile MIBs have been developed from a core base of
DMI MIFs, analogous to the SNMP MIB.

Using a Common Agent architecture such as those used in
DMI Software Development Kits (SDKs), the MIFs can be
translated into corresponding MIBs.  Thus implementers
can use MIFs under a Common Agent or DMI Service Layer,
or MIBs under an SNMP agent, to provide either SNMP or
DMI support for mobile users in a managed network
environment.

"From the outset, the MMTF has stated that we have no
intention of duplicating the work of standards bodies
like the IETF and DMTF," said Jim Soriano, Vice President
of Product Development for Xircom, another MMTF founder
company.  "By using creating a set of extensible mobile
management objects that can be implemented as both MIBs
and MIFs, we hope to help point the way to a common
solution to mobile management problems that will be
acceptable to both the DMTF and the IETF."

The MMTF's Mobile Management MIBs has been made available
for testing and will be submitted to both the DMTF and
the IETF for consideration later this month.

The Mobile Management Task Force was initiated by
Epilogue Technology Corp. and Xircom Inc., to promote new
standards to administer laptop, palmtop, and other mobile
network computer users. Membership in the Mobile
Management Task Force is open to computer systems
manufacturers, software developers, MIS personnel, and
network administrators concerned with issues surrounding
the administration of mobile computer users.

IBM'S INET TO SPARK INTERNET APPLICATIONS

Application developers can now "test drive" their
Internet applications in a driving course sponsored by
IBM.  IBM announced an iNet porting extension to its
Solution Partnership Center (SPC) in San Mateo, Calif.
The SPC uses the IBM RS/6000 platform, running IBM's
version of Unix, AIX.  The iNet porting facility provides
developers with access to systems, support, and
tools -- either over the Internet or in person at the
SPC.

"We intend to make the RS/6000 the Internet server of
choice," said Tom Fornoff, director of workstation
marketing for IBM's RS/6000 Division.  "We're confident
that developers using this facility will realize the
advantages in performance and flexibility that the
RS/6000 offers."

INET OFFERINGS

The iNet porting facility's complete list of resources,
free to developers (as available), include:

* An iNet porting World Wide Web (WWW) home page at
http://www.spc.ibm.com that provides information on the
center and how to use its resources

* Internet access to a number of RS/6000 systems running
AIX, allowing developers to test drive the platform and
experience its Internet server capabilities

* Scheduled, secure Internet access to a range of RS/6000
servers, software development tools, and technical
support that let developers port or create Internet
applications for the RS/6000 platform

In addition, developers can use the latest RS/6000
uniprocessor, symmetric multiprocessor, and scalable
POWERparallel systems (RS/6000 SP).  IBM development
tools will also be available.  These include products
from IBM and third parties like BlueStone, Illustra
Information Technologies, Lotus, Netscape, Prodigy,
Progressive Networks, RAD Technologies, Spyglass, VDOnet,
Verity, Worlds, Xing Technology, and others.  These
vendors will also provide technical support and training.

Marketing support is also available for Internet
applications created for or ported to the RS/6000
platform.  Marketing support includes a listing on a "Hot
Internet Applications" Web page directory on the SPC's
home page; marketing links with IBM channels, product
divisions, and the Industry Solution Units.

BOON TO BIG BLUE, DEVELOPERS

Industry observers were excited about IBM's announcement
and said the iNet porting facility is a boon to both IBM
and developers.  "This allows IBM to immediately allow
developers to begin testing code, testing new market
ideas -- without building an infrastructure of corner
stores," said Rich Doherty, a director of The
Envisioneering Group (Seaford, N.Y.).

Doherty described IBM's iNet porting facility as a
"virtual service bureau," but said developers who still
want the security and sanctity of testing their
applications in person can take their applications to the
facility in San Mateo.

The Envisioneering Group has accessed the site and built
ports on IBM's supercomputers.  "There's nothing else
like it," Doherty said.  "You can call into the heart of
the technology, try out ideas in private, and have access
to thousands of dollars of development time."

TRY BEFORE THEY BUY

Not only can developers test out their applications,
developers can bring their clients in and walk through
the applications with them to work through any problems,
Doherty explained.  "This is a `try before they buy' set
up," he said.  "You couldn't ask for a better match of
customer and vendor."

Other companies may try to copy elements of IBM's iNet
porting facility, but Doherty said IBM gives developers
lots of access to its system.  "These things are usually
portioned out in terms of minutes, not in terms of tens
of hours," he said.  "IBM has dozens of ports to ensure
that each developer has 22 continuous hours.  That's
unique -- that's not just driving the car around the
block; that's like borrowing it from the dealer for a
weekend."

Another analyst agreed that IBM's interest in Internet
applications is good for the company.  "IBM has a point
of leverage in this new environment -- it's called data,"
said John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.).

IBM has huge amounts of data, mostly on its back-end
systems, Robb explained.  "IBM wants to help companies
distribute or publish or integrate that data with their
Web offerings," he said.  "So anything that IBM can offer
in the way of tool sets is positive.  Everyone wants to
Web-enable their legacy systems.  IBM should be in the
business of helping companies do that."

LOTUS LAYS OUT INTERNET STRATEGY

Keeping in line with the trend of major computer
companies going public with their Internet strategies,
IBM subsidiary Lotus Development Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.)
held a conference last month to outline how Notes will
integrate and interact with the Internet.

The company is working with the Internet -- not against
it, was the message Lotus stressed to conference
attendees.  Lotus said it aims to combine its Notes's
messaging and groupware services with the ubiquity of the
World Wide Web (WWW).  As part of that plan, Notes
Release 4 will support key WWW protocols, such as HTTP,
HTML, and Java technology -- which will allow users with
either Notes clients or Web browsers to benefit from
Notes applications.

Michael Zisman, Lotus's executive vice president and CEO,
offered three specific strategies for Notes integration
with the Internet:

* Deliver a Notes server in 1996 that joins HTTP, HTML,
and Java technology with existing Release 4 Notes server
technology to provide a Web development and application
hosting environment

* Deliver extensible Web-enabled business application
frameworks that can be customized by Lotus business
partners and customers

* Extend Notes clients with the InterNotes Web Navigator,
a Notes Release 4 Web browsing facility that allows users
to automate Web access in Notes applications.

LOWER PRICES

Fearing that many companies would shift their
communications onto the relatively low-cost Internet as
an alternative to pricey software, Lotus also lowered the
price of Lotus Notes Mail to $55 per seat.  In addition,
Lotus' InterNotes Web Publisher, which originally sold
for $2,995, will soon be available free via the Web to
Notes.  Also marked for discount are Lotus's upgrade for
NotesSuite Desktop, its SmartSuite desktop productivity
applications, and the NotesSuite Application
Collection -- these will all be reduced by 33 percent,
from $299 to $199.

"The new, more aggressive pricing for Notes will allow
our customers to more quickly deploy Notes throughout
their organizations," said Jeff Papows, Lotus' executive
vice president and chief operating officer.  "In
particular, the new mail client and lower pricing will
make Notes much more attractive for users who need
electronic mail and Internet access."

Lotus said its merger with IBM allowed the company to
establish its new pricing model.  "Lotus can now take a
longer-term financial perspective and position ourselves
as the price and value leader in the messaging and
groupware market," Papows said.

But the company raised the price of its Notes server
software from $275 to $495, rationalizing that the new
and improved software will be able to link more PCs with
Notes to centralized computers.

NOTES IS THE WEB

"Lotus is not giving customers a choice of Notes or the
Web -- Lotus is saying Notes is the Web," said David
Marshak, vice president and senior consultant for the
Patricia Seybold Group (Boston, Mass.).  The concept of
Notes as the Web is very appealing to users because many
browsers don't offer E-mail, Marshak said.  "Lotus offers
additional benefits with its browsing," he said.  "It can
organize the work, run agents against it, have additional
security."

With Notes as a Web browser, users can browse and do all
the things with it they can do internally with Notes --
workflow, connecting to transaction processes, tracking,
and monitoring, Marshak explained.  Marshak praised the
company for lowering its prices.  "Lotus is saying that
the price of the client should not be a barrier to
whatever you want to do," he said.

"Lotus is making a very powerful statement," Marshak
continued.  "Lotus is saying: We want you as Notes users.
Whether you want E-mail, a Web browser, or Notes
applications, we have the best client in any of these
uses."

LOOK FOR VALUE

But another analyst said pricing incentives are not
necessarily the news.  "Pricing is not the issue with
Notes and the Internet," said Tom Austin, research
director with the Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "The
value is in supporting Web browsers."

Within two years, there will be millions of browsers out
there, Austin said.  "By supporting the browsers and the
Internet protocols, Lotus will have extreme breadth of
capability," he said.  "The value to Lotus is that it
will gain access to 100 million people."

"Lotus is modifying its technology so that anyone with
a Web browser can have access to everything that's on a
Notes server," Austin said.  "Lotus has opened up Notes
to the point where users can take advantage of Notes
server without using a client."

While Lotus has accomplished its Internet goals from a
technical point of view, the company must focus on its
marketing message, Austin said.  "How do they establish
the tens of millions of people interested in the Internet
as Notes users, rather than Netscape users?" Austin
asked.  "That's their problem: marketing."

Lotus needs to figure out how to establish a new positive
image in the marketplace, as well as to make people
understand the benefits that Lotus delivers and to make
those benefits as easy as the Web, Austin said.  "A lot
of people call Lotus groupware `gropeware,' with everyone
groping around trying to find its meaning," he said.
"Whereas the Web is intuitively obvious to users within
five minutes."

"At their conference, Lotus stressed that users can build
great applications.  That doesn't excite people," Austin
said.  "Lotus does the Web, Lotus does groupware --
that's not enough.  Lotus needs a stronger marketing
strategy."

IBM TO EXPAND RMON SUPPORT

Although IBM has supported RMON for some time, the
company is introducing extensions to the network
monitoring standard across its hub products starting in
the next few months.

The extensions include two probe modules, one designed
to resemble the RMON 2 standard once it is finalized and
another to generate test traffic on a local area network.
Right now, IBM has only one probe capable of performing
these functions: an Ethernet probe for its 8250 Nways
intelligent hub which can monitor three Ethernet segments
simultaneously.

In the coming months, IBM will announce these
capabilities for the 8260, at the top of IBM's line, said
Sallie Matlack, an IBM-certified IT specialist.  Lesser
IBM hubs will receive these extensions sometime in the
future.

RMON (remote network monitoring) is an industry-standard
method of collecting statistical data at the physical and
data layers of network segments and sending the data back
to a central site for analysis.  RMON-compliant probes
can also detect problems and send warnings to the
management station.

RMON 2 will expand the range of data that can be
gathered, looking at higher functions such as network
protocols and applications, and will provide an end-to-
end view.

IBM's Enterprise Communications Analysis Module (ECAM)
is a block of software that looks at the same things RMON
2 will when the standard is complete.  IBM has created
a mechanism where ECAM can be automatically downloaded
from a management station into a probe that has been
engineered to accept modules like ECAM.

IBM's other RMON extension, called Traffic Transmission
Management Module (TTMM), can take network traffic
collected through other monitoring tools and spit it out
onto a local segment.  This lets network managers monitor
the impact on that segment via performance monitoring
tools.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER

To handle the information gathered through RMON probes,
IBM last October introduced a version of its software
product Nways Campus Manager - ReMon, a version that
includes ECAM and TTMM.  In November, IBM brought the
software from NetView for AIX to HP OpenView.

ReMon lets managers tell the distributed agents which
packets to capture and send back to the management
platform.  It also displays the information gathered from
the probes graphically.

IDC FORECASTS A GLOOMY 1996 FOR THE INDUSTRY

In spite of a bullish 10-year outlook for on-line
commerce, researcher International Data Corp. (IDC)
yesterday predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment
as investors and corporations suffer through the
discouragingly slow development of a significant consumer
base.  By this time next year, IDC predicted 20 percent
of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web
sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in
"ghost" sites.

On-line information service providers (such as
CompuServe, America Online, Microsoft Network, and
Prodigy) will derive more than half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis,
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point."

Gens also said IT industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate
spending on IT will rise from 2 percent of revenues to
more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC said it believes
on-line commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more by
the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers, and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."

INTERNET APPLIANCES

By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of "Internet appliances" -- low-cost devices that allow
the user to access on-line information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500, Gens said.  They
will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The game
console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing for
simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years, Internet
Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than $100 to
free) by businesses that want customers to access their
on-line services, according to Gens.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicted that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to $20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to $15 per month within
the next two years, partially because cable companies
(with the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier, IDC said.

MICROSOFT

IDC predicted Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds."  One effect of the
Internet phenomenon of 1995 has been that many on Wall
Street and within the IT industry now are forecasting the
undoing of Microsoft's hold on the industry, and hailing
the rise of Netscape and Sun Microsystems as the new
industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," Gens
said.  "We also believe in spite of the recurring rumors
of Department of Justice investigations, Microsoft will
escape any major antitrust activity in 1996, an election
year.  Additionally, Microsoft will conclude that its
ventures into new businesses will have a greater chance
of success without the Microsoft brand."

OTHER PREDICTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR

* There will be an Internet-driven shakeout in the
application software and application development tools
businesses in 1996 and 1997.  The emergence of the Web,
and the growing importance of entertaining,
multimedia-rich interfaces, will challenge the current
crop of client/server tool suppliers like Microsoft,
Powersoft, Dynasty, Forte, and Seer, as well as
application package companies like SAP and Peoplesoft.

* Software licensing will support network access and
short-term "rental."  Behind the scenes, suppliers are
currently exploring how to "crack the code"  on this
charging model; the leaders will begin experimenting in
the marketplace in 1996 and 1997.

* Large systems will become "politically correct."
High-end servers will increasingly be required to scale
to support direct access by thousands to potentially
millions of users, as opposed to today's hundreds to
thousands of corporate users.  This accelerated scaling
requirement will put pressure on Microsoft's enterprise
strategy due to NT's relatively low-end design point,
and boost the Unix camp's high-end business.
Beneficiaries will be IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun
Microsystems, and -- perhaps -- a rejuvenated Digital.

* The increased scope of the Net will favor suppliers
that excel in creating "virtual organizations."
Successful suppliers will be able to play well in a
"virtual organization"  structure -- able to act as
creator, investor, producer, and/or partner.

PLATINUM TECHNOLOGY RELEASES CHARGEBACK SYSTEM

PLATINUM technology inc. last month released CIMS, an
integrated chargeback system for heterogeneous,
distributed computing environments.  The system provides
critical chargeback services that track information
resources used organization-wide.  The CIMS
applications -- including job accounting, chargeback,
cost analysis, resource utilization reporting, capacity
planning, and resource monitoring -- simplify the IS
management process, according to PLATINUM.

On Dec. 13, 1995, PLATINUM technology acquired the
developer of the CIMS integrated chargeback system, the
privately-held BMS of Newcastle, Calif.  BMS will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of PLATINUM technology.  Terms
of the agreement were not disclosed.  The company said
the addition of BMS chargeback software is a key
component of PLATINUM's plan to provide complete,
integrated operations and systems management solutions
for the Open Enterprise Environment (OEE).

HOOKS TO CABLETRON

In related news, PLATINUM technology formed an alliance
with Cabletron Systems.  The company said a broad array
of its diverse software product line will support and
integrate with Cabletron Systems' Spectrum Enterprise
Manager.  As part of a technology alliance to provide
platform integration, PLATINUM will provide its systems
and database management customers the ability to manage
a wide variety of open, distributed enterprise networked
environments using SPECTRUM.

PLATINUM has recently announced additional relationships
with HP and AT&T, as well as development plans for its
own framework, POEMS.

Various point products could be adapted to hook into
SPECTRUM by different means.  The first phase of
integration for most partners is through the use of a
Cabletron-provided toolkit that PLATINUM could use to
enable event passing, database information exchange, and
script integration.  Another phase of integration would
be via published APIs.  Further levels of integration
between SPECTRUM and PLATINUM -- including enhanced alarm
integration and knowledge-based integration -- will be
evaluated on an application-by application-basis.
Regardless, the companies said they are confident the
open nature of SPECTRUM will allow quick integration to
take place.

Among the PLATINUM products being considered for
adaptation to SPECTRUM are:
* Apriori, PLATINUM's client/server help desk product:
customers have the need for network events, such as an
exceeded network threshold, to be reported to the
corporate help desk.

* Xfer, PLATINUM's software distribution tool: IS support
staffs need to have a way to distribute software and
revisions across networks.  When integrated with
SPECTRUM, Xfer actions can be seen from SPECTRUM's
network map, providing a graphical view of distribution
actions.

* AutoSys, PLATINUM's client/server job management tool:
clients need to reliably schedule jobs across their
entire networked enterprise.

* DBVision, PLATINUM's database performance management
and monitoring tool: customers need to monitor and ensure
database availability across networks and assure database
integrity.

* Database management tools: PLATINUM's database
management products support the DB2 family, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Informix.  SPECTRUM
exports to these and other popular formats.

ON TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES NLM FOR IP ADDRESS MANAGEMENT

ON Technology Corp. announced the first NetWare Loadable
Module (NLM) that provides central IP address management,
a frustrating and onerous task placed on NetWare
administrators in the rush to get Internet access to
every desktop.  Awareness of the IP address management
problem has grown as a result of demand for Internet
access and a shortage of IP addresses under the current
addressing system.

The company said the new product, IPTrack, is the first
implementation of a TCP/IP protocol called Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) specifically designed as
an NLM for NetWare environments.  ON Technology's IPTrack
automates the work it takes for a NetWare administrator
to assign an IP address, maintain a log of address
assignments, track the address if the workstation is
moved, troubleshoot IP address conflicts, and re-assign
inactive addresses.

To purchase IPTrack or receive additional information,
network administrators should send inquiries over the
Internet to info@on.com or visit the ON Technology home
page on the World Wide Web at http://www.on.com.
